Not to mention, I still have to pretty much fight for a computer to check my email and such whenever I get home from work. I just finished some yard/house work for Sammy and now I have time to kill before she gets home. So now where to begin?  Work too has been getting very lame and I think this is most definately time to move on from the zoo. The head of our department is on a massive power trip and is trying to make our lives miserable. We all stood up and fought for Jullee, and now its payback. We have been severely understaffed and when Dan came back from Alaska early, they REFUSED to rehire him because he had a moving violation in February. Also, since when does going on vacation take you off the payroll? Granted it was a 3 month long vacation, but still. Insanity. They are cracking down on uniforms which is understandable. They are also cracking down on cell phones, which I understand, but if I am on break and away from the public, I will be damned if I cant check my messages. Our department head came and caught Matt the other day and he got written up for it. Bullshit. I read the policy. It says that the cell phone rule is enforced when the person is on duty, and our break is off the clock technically, sofuck her for saying that Matt was in violation. And now the last straw just happened. It used to be at the zoo that you could bring your family with youand as long as you were there, you could all get in for free. Now, you cant even get dropped off inside the zoo. Anyone not with a badge is denied access. So now theyre saying I can take my family to the Field Museum for free but fuck you if you want to go to the zoo for the afternoon. I just dont get it. They are REALLY trying to cut all employee benefits to drive us away. I think I understand it though. Drive away the people who keep coming back, like myself, to get a whole new crew every year at the lowest wages. Sneaky. Also makes me lose alot of respect for the zoo. However, we are fighting back. Documentation of everything and any violation we see, hear, or encounter goes down on record and the proper authorities will be contacted. So you push us, and we push back.  Tony went out on tour. I guess its going pretty good, but I havent heard much from my bro because he plays every night, sleeps in a van, doesnt eat, and is sick as hell now. He is cutting the tour a bit short by coming home Thursday because of what else is going on.  Grandma died on Tuesday morning. We knew it wasnt going to be long. All of us were here. Leigh came back, Karli is in town, etc. We all got to say goodbye and then that was it. It was eerily calm that morning. We took our time calling hospice and everyone else. It was just really peaceful. I woke up around 4 that morning and knew it was over. Leigh said she woke up at 3:30, Jun said 3:30 too. I guess I just sense these things a bit later. We all did our own little things. Dad made his fire. I burned incense. Jim went to work. We even did a sage smudging ritual on the house for my mom. Look into that if youve never heard of it. Native American purification ritual. Very cool. Mom is still very sad. She takes stuff out on me and I dont blame her, but she yelled at me the other night for wanting to make a pizza for dinner. I didnt quite get it but whatever. Now adays I just hug her alot and tell her I love her. All I can do really.  Tae Kwon Do is insanity. I feel lame for not keeping up lately, but I have had other things to do. Im back up to 225 which makes me sad, but I know as soon as I get the chance, I will be back in full swing and that will drop in no time. So yeah. Also I found out the plan that Mohammed is trying to do. I found out that Todd is his little lackey in the matter and is snitching to him. And I wonder what their friendship is because every time I talk to Mohammed, he is making fun of Todd. But I guess they hang out, so whatever. I have gone back to not trusting Todd. I feel kinda sad about this, because I was just starting to accept him as a person. Now I feel like what the both of them are doing is sneaky and underhanded and I wish they would realize the values that we strive for, the same ones that I based this site on, are found by hard work and dedication, not on what a piece of paper says you are. So inmy mind, they are nothing but neophytes in the world of martial arts. They are in it for rank, title, and the ability to hurt someone. To feel power over others. To feel superior. Makes me sad really. As for me, look to the right and see my quote tounderstand why I do it.  Now off to dosome stretching and possibly a light work out on my own.  Oh yeah. I ripped my pocketon my shorts and now I am sad. It happens...
