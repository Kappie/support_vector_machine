Most of my time was spent cramming for my first calculus exam, the outcome of which will determine whether or not I’m screwed in the class or not.  Since I haven’t taken college algebra and trig in about 8 years, I’ve been forced to jam a shmack-load of theorems, properties and the like into my cranium, all the while keeping up on the actual Calc stuff.  Yippie!  Rebecca, my girlfriend, did come over and keep me company for the better part of Saturday though, so that helped make my studying not quite so dismal.  During one of my breaks both us headed out to find a local Asian market, with the goal of finding some furikake (rice toppings – tiny pieces of seaweed, egg, shrimp, fish, etc) and instant Japanese curry.  We ended up at a Korean-owed place with little selection, though I did mange to pick up some Japanese  non -instant curry as well as a packet of instant  Korean  curry.  Oh well, I think I made out ok in the end.  Late that evening, while surfing the net during another of my breaks, I noticed that the Review of the Month winners had been posted for GameFAQs for October through December.  Curious as to who won, I clicked the link and was surprised to find that I won for both October (for my  WWE Raw 2  review)  and  November (my  Rainbow 6 III  review).  Sweet!  That now means I’ll have $75 available to spend at Amazon.com on games, books, DVDs or whatever else my heart desires.  Who says there’s no money in game reviewing?  Heh…  I’m going to end this entry with a dialogue from  Morrowind  that I found especially poignant.  It’s spoken by a world-weary warrior named Umbra - one of the coolest characters in the game (despite his small role).  So, without further delay I present to you:    Umbra’s Last Words   Have you come seeking me?  My name is unimportant, and my accomplishments are few.  What is the use of knowing my name?  If it will make you more comfortable, you may call me Umbra.  It is the name of my blade, though it may as well be mine.  What are any of my accomplishments in the whole of this world?  I have traveled from one end of the land to the other.  I have killed creatures that can stop a man’s heart with but a look.  I have the blood of man and mer uncountable on my hands.  I have seen the atrocities of war and the hideous excess of peace.  There is nothing left for me in this world.  I have seen the wholesale slaughter of men, women, entire races of people.  Villages have burned before my eyes – my hand has held the torch, and my hand has thrown water on the flames.  I have been ankle deep in blood, swinging Umbra in a wide arc, all for the glory of the battle, and here I still stand.  I have no more to do in this life.  I have saved whole towns from packs of daedra, and I have slaughtered men for the glory of countless nobles.  All that is left for me is my own death, and the gods have cheated me of that.  All I ask is to die like a warrior, but how can that be?  I don’t believe it is too much to ask to die as a warrior should – in battle.  It is my curse, though, that I have found no one that can best me in combat.  Are you the one that can?  Can you come and lift me from these shackles of life?  Come then, be the new wielder of Umbra!
