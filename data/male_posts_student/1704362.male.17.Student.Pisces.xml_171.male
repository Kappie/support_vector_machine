Arguments from authority are unacceptable.     urlLink -Carl Sagan          ...But Robert Paine, an ecologist at University of Washington who chaired an advisory panel on endangered salmon and trout, said his team was warned by the government to remove facts that undermined policy.  "We were told to strip out specific scientific recommendations or see our report end up in a drawer," Paine said.     urlLink -CNN         urlLink House.gov - Investigating the State of Science Under the Bush Administration   urlLink CNN.com - Bush Science policy swayed by politics   urlLink Scientific American - Bush-League Lysenkoism   urlLink Union of Concerned Scientists   They're not liberal lackeys or tree-hugging hippies.

There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to the American public. It is a dimension as vast as space, but as hollow as a coconut.
