If I remember rightly it was you writing "Bish 4 Men" in his book. Yes, I found it funny. It is very funny IMO.   Yes, I know you and Bish seem to like annoying each other. Or working together to annoy Mat even more. I respect that. Its been very funny over the past few years in science.  Speaking of Mat, he'll be setting up for tomorrow by now. Will the 'big plan' work? I personally don't think it will. But you gotta acknoledge the amount of work Mat's put into this project. Good luck...  Oh, and when did I say I'd be doing the pitchforking? =P
