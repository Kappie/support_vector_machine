Gosh, it was cold last night, I mean seriously, I wanted to jump into a lighted fireplace, I don’t think that would help either, the whole I would be dead thing wouldn’t help at all because we all wish to live.  I don’t think it helped that I am one to sleep buck-naked but still dang it was cold!!!  So I got 3, yes count them one, two, three comforters to curl under combined with my new body pillow and fell asleep.  I dreamt some freaky, creaky dreams I tell you.  That is the last time I eat before I go to sleep!  Damn, chocolate, may you rot in purgatory, for all of your sins.  Have you ever really noticed that?  Chocolate, I mean.  There is sooo much temptation it is outrageous.  And, then you eat to much and your stomach be hurting, all because yur gave into it.  So, maybe that is why.  And, they do say not to eat before you go to bed, so kids listen to me, "NO CHOCOLATE BEFORE BED!"  There that is settled.  So, people have been giving me bracelets…  So people keep them coming!  But now the braclets on my left arm are never coming off, not at all!  Well, maybe for me to shower but that is all!  Or if someone that I care to listen to tells me to take them off.  But, it won’t be my parents, nope no-sir-e-bob!  So, I have the snuffles and like badly.  I would make myself chicken soup but I can’t because I don’t eat meat.  So, when I get home I am gonna have some tea, yeppers some chamomile tea!  Maybe I will feel better!  That is my plan!  So, tomorrow I am getting Nicole’s digital camera and we are gonna do some “amateur” photography for Jared.  I shaved, and trimmed, and clipped, so I can look somewhat attractive... I can’t yet to send them and also take them.  It will be more fun than a jack rabbit tripping on some acid while in the funhouse.  So, anyways I wrote Jared another poem and I will post it later…  My Morning Just as wonderful as the morning sunlight Arranging and filtering onto my face Resting next to you, my heart fills with delight Every moment gazing at you in this place Dreaming together about how we are  Spending every waking morning with you by my side Perfect match, together we will go far In these morning times we have nothing to hide Every dawn we have to spend and enjoy it Heaven is our little room, lying in your embrace Lying in your arms, and feeling your sweet kiss Every single touch you place my body won't erase Remember always the together we will forever  be bliss
