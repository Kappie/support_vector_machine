Now it's getting straight down the middle thingy... before that it was left sweep to the right formal one, before that was spiky... When I first started to use gel to spike my hair, I got a new hairstyle every single time I used it, which was like a new hairstyle everyday. Cool eh? Now that I know how to use gel and style properly(thanks to a few tips from my good friend Rajiv, too bad he's gay, haha!), I can get quite nice results according to my taste(which doesn't really match a girl's way of thinking, me thinks). My mum always says i have horrible taste, especially when it comes to choosing clothes. Kind of gives me a goood reason to play golf, don't you agree? Haha...
