I don't think there was anyone in the audience who wasn't pissing themselves for pretty much the whole night. Not because they were all really old, Bill was v.v. funny. A lot of it was hysterical as a Baileyism but if I were to repeat it, or were anyone to repeat it, I imagine it'd be unthinkably less funny. His comic timing (and his electronics (such as the Wooo machine)) was flawless. Well done to both him and the tech crew at the Town Hall.  OK, people who don't play Final Fantasy, or people who do but haven't yet got round to FFX, skip this section cause it won't make sense. Today, on a shadow of a thought, I did the chocobo race at Remiem Temple, attempting to get 3 chests and finish the race first. After about 6 attempts (deliberately slower to work out the chests I woulod have to get to be able to do it), I managed it, to find my prize to be 30 Wings to Discovery. Which means I gave Auron armour with Break HP Limit. Funfun, now he's got 23,947HP. Of course after catching 10 of every capturable monster in the game (100 species, so that's 1000 indvidual monsters to catch), I had 99 Dark Matters, which means Auron also has Ribbon on that piece of armour, so he has the ultimate armour there, really, doesn't he? Got Wakka's celestial weapon today as well... funny thing with that is that I wasn't expecting him to do 80,000 damage. He's been doing 9,999 for ages and ages so seeing him do that much was a bit of a shock, really. Oh, and I don't know why, but it appears that I currently have a lack of a hardest boss in the game. Instead of having Nemesis in the "Original" creations, I have a blank, which when selected is replied to with "He's not ready yet!". Curious. Very curious. Oh, and something else I didn't expect is that Barbatos, the big guy with arms inside Sin, gives you far more levels than Varona, the "Area Conquest" creation for inside Sin, who is basically Barbatos but with more health, dealing more damage, and an immunity to armour break. What? Ah well. At least I know who to train up against. I bought 99 Clear Spheres from the training centre guy, so once I've finished the Sphere grid with everyone (I'd imagine some time next year) I'll use those. If anyone can tell me without looking at a guide or FAQ where you get some of the stat spheres from, that'd be v. helpful. At the moment I'm just wasting my money bribing things. Tried to bribe Barbatos with 3 million. That didn't work. I was livid.  Hello again, people who aren't complete geeks. Actually, most people would probably have read that anyway out of spite, thinking "What the hell?" through the duration. Oh well.  Anyway, translate this if you will, it has some reference to the geeky section above; E's cunno, Myiny... E teth'd sayh du syga drehkc tevvelimd un lusbmelydat un cdnaccvim un yhodrehk...
