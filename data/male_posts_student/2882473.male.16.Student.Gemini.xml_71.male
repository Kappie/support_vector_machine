My liege!    urlLink   What Monty Python Character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Power Rangers Movie!    urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Don't get blood splatters on you when you shoot your victim. Your methods are a bit uncouth but your finesse and sense of style is impeccable. With a bit of guidance you could live among us in the world of vampires.      urlLink   How would you Murder?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Suicide! (and you know it, so... dont u have something to do?)    urlLink   Choose your Dramatic Death (Now w/pics!!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Meh, whatever.     Unity. You Turly Desire Unity. You wish that the world was together as one, and world peace was among us. You enjoy sitting in natures peaceful spots to get away from war and hate.   PLEASE RATE     urlLink   What Do You Truly Desire? *PICS*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    hmm, that one's strange. I wished for money for myself.  Haven't done a great deal today. I went to PC World in Croydon with my oldest sister and parents, in order to by her a lap-top computer for when she starts university in September. I had to go, as I'm the one who knows the most about computers in my family, (You didn't expect that did you?) and I was needed to give advice to my parents on what to buy. We eventually settled for the cheapest one they had, but still about Â£650 or so. This probably limits  my  chances of getting a new computer now, as my mum isn't likely to want to buy 2 computers in one summer. I may get lucky though, if we find a cheap one.  And 3 posts in one day. Wow, I should be revising more. Oh well, did a bit of maths revision, and got through all my exercise books, and understand pretty much all of it. I'm sure I'll get at least a D or a C. Best do physics tomorrow. I doubt I'll bother doing much business revision.   Weather:  Overcast, mild  Reading:  Harry Potter 3  Listening to:  Star Wars techno music  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  Nowt  Annoyed with:  Getting 'Suicide' as my dramatic death  Mood:  Good
