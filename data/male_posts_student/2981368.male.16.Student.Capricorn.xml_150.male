Thats means no more Geography...EVER (wowowowowowowowowow)  Theres another science exam, but its in a week and i've revised it all now anyways.   Tomorrow is ICT and Maffs noncalc. ICT should be a walkover, Maffs is a bit of a bugger. I need to get a B overall to make Mr Upward look stupid and all that. I think a bit of revision now and s'more at Joe's after ICT should get me through no problem *grin*  The week of hell has begun...  (PS: the title was just a random thought that passed through my mind while typing this. and it was in the sci exam as well. woohoo!)
