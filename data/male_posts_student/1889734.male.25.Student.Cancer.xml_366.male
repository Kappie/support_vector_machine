Despite trying to tone down my optimism, I'm getting carried away with a sense of hope that this could actually happen.  I recall the excitement when Bush (41) announced a similar venture, only to see it die when the estimates came back at $400 billion.  One of the articles I've look at this morning suddenly demonstrated the wisdom of Bush's 5% per year increase at NASA.  This money is not intended to actually get us to the moon.  The money, along with a focused direction, is intended to get us to grapple with the problems of putting a permenent presence on the moon, and later Mars.  It makes no sense to cobble together a massive program using today's technology, with a lot of assumptions, and then pull out a $400 billion pricetag when no one really knows which approach holds the most promise.  The Bush budget proposal is a way to throw seed money out there.  As we begin to do some serious research on the problems, and begin testing the new technology, we will gain a better understanding of what it would take to accomplish the mission.  At some point in the next 5 years, a realistic budget can be drawn up, and we will have some sense of what it will take.  This avoids the trap of pricing the mission beyond the ability to even try.  The Bush 41 proposal was kind of like getting some guys together and saying "We want to be Delta Airlines" when the airplane hadn't even been invented.  Imagine inventing the technology and then going instantly to the scale of Delta.  The cost would be staggering and the technical issues daunting.  The new proposal will take us along in measured steps as we begin to build the things that have never moved beyond paper design.  Now we can see what can be done.  The budget proposal is modest, and it seems certain to happen despite the Luddites who would rather we fix school roofs and pour money into programs that have already proven their failure.  The next decade promises to be an exciting time to live, and I'm looking forward to every morsel of news.  Maybe it's time to re-evaluate the career again.
