One day you will unearth what you seek, But this tilled soil grows no plant  To reminisce should be a crime; We hang by our last thread. When the lines break and we crumble, Will life's answer be buried under dead?  Don’t worry though, I'll be here. I’ll stand by your side ‘till you kill me. Please use my blood to soften the earth. Where you dig is where my coffin will be.
