Before shopping, we went to have lunch at McDonalds. It's been almost 3 weeks since I ever had fast food. My stomach was feeling uneasy, my suspiscion is that coke float in my set meal. Sundae on coke doesn't goes well in my system I guess. After chit-chatting there for an hour or so, we were at the Orchard library. I borrowed some cookery and computer books, however they were just there waiting for me. How loyal they are!  Being stucked inside Ngee Ann City for hours, I decided we should get the hell out of there and take a fresh breath of air and also expose to the sunlight. It's good to see the sight of Orchard Road after living in Cambodia for 18 days. We then proceed to Heeren, one of my favourite hangout to enjoy the eye candy of those stylish people from all "range" (from gay, hip-hopper, ah beng, ah lian, nerd, stud, etc).  I am thinking of buying myself a jeans, and maybe perhaps a clothe or more. Afterall, it's Great Singapore Sales! Why not strike while the iron is hot! I have eyed on a few items, but I did not specially bring enough cash for those. I just want to buy everything at one go, so you need not have to carry those things around while you are selecting.  I saw a few new arrival necklace which originally cost $9.90, priced at $5 only. I bought a Scorpion necklace, what people might think of me? A "pai kia" or what?  I just heck care, I just like it and see no wrong in wearing it. But the problem is I looked so "guai", will I be a laughing stock if I wear it?  After that, we went to arcade and they saw me playing DDR. Feel quite bad having them to watch me playing and they themselves not playing. Once again, they accompanied me. Not only that, they even accompanied me to Carrefour till almost 8 pm to buy some bakery needs. Feel so sorry that they have to starve their own stomach just to accompany me, it's already bad enough for them to accompany me the whole day. Guess this is what friends are for and I think I am quite selfish and self-centered to only think of myself. I did spared a thought for others, however I can't resist the urge to get things done first for myself. I don't want and don't like the feeling of regret for not getting the things I want and need.  Life is like this, you have to grab the opportunity before it slips away. I realised that in life, if you want to gain a thing, you have to lose another thing. That's why nothing is perfect!
