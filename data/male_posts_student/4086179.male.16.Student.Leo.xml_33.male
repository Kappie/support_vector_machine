Pity you don't work there anymore there Pete... hehehe I got some tomatoes, some phosphorus, some tomato duster to protect them from bugs and some fertilizer.  This is for Science. I have to do a SRP which is a student research project. It is my own experiment in which I am going to determine the affect of phosphorus in plants, and the necessity of it in fertilizers. Specifically the affect on tomatoes. fun fun fun... seriously, I looooooooooooooooooooove science, just ask Luke, he'll tell you; with conviction.
