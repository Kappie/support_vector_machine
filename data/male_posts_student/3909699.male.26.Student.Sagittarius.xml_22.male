I hope he doesn't read this because, well, mums are special aren't they? I actually saw quite a few attractive 'birds' while i was down there, like 20-30. This would still only have been a statistically irrelevent 1% or so of the munting female population, but is still notable. The second or third one I saw, I noticed had a strong Australian accent (using the word 'park' to mean 'parking space' and pronouncing parallel with the emphasis on the last syllable). My first thought was, fucking London sucking all the talent out of Sydney. But this I realised was applying my old 'capital attracts talent' theory, which I was actually refuted by previous forays into London. So instead I applied my new 'birds in London are rough' theory, which of course would work in this instance, with the proviso that the only attractive girls there are from somewhere else. Sadly, it's pretty difficult to actually ascertain where people come from when viewing them on the street, but it is worth noting that of those I did hear talking, three were some kind of Latin, and one was American. Note that i am not claiming that all girls from these countries are fit - most Spanish and Italian girls in London are as rough as sandpaper. On a related note, it seems fairly obvious to me that God does not exist. However, it is becoming very apparent to me that many of my peers do not feel the same way. In fact, since I left the West Country, which I would have pegged as one of the more religious parts of the country, most of the people I've met, including most of my friends I've been hanging out with, have been practising Christians. So I feel it might be worth spelling out why Christianity is rubbish, at the risk of fucking off Fr. John even more: 1. Trinitarianism is ridiculous. All Christians, except some way out ones (Unitarians, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc.) believe in the Trinity i.e. that the father, son, and holy spirit are equal parts of the 'Godhead'. This is a completely stupid theory. The divinity of Christ is in fact itself totally stupid. How can a someone simultaneously be infinite and a human being? They can't, that's how. note that there's nothing about the trinity in the bible, and it was only invented like 400 years later. The divinity of Christ is in the bible and is patently stupid, broadly because of my next point. . . 2. The infinite cannot have personal attributes. This is where the Moslems, while realising the stupidity of a man being God slip up, although nowhere near as much as the Christians. The infinite doesn't care about things, have emotions or do things. Fucking about is the province of finite beings. If you're infinite you just do everything all at once, encompass everything, know everything, be everything. This implies pantheism. Which is basically the same as atheism as I see it, because if, as Spinoza had it, God is everywhere and everything, then as I see it his existence basically doens't mean anything either way. If, on the other hand, God is not everywhere and everything, then he's just a super-powerful space alien, in which case he's as fucking lame as the rest of us, amen.
