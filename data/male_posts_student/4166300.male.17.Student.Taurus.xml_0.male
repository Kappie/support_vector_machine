I can already hear Alex referring to me as a "Touchy-Feely-Pussy-Girl" at school.  I leave to do a tour of drill instructor duty at Fort Hunter Liggett this saturday, unfortunately its Advanced Orientation, so I'm laying the smackdown on 15 ten-year old kids who can't sit still for a week.  AO is the wild west, and Seaman (Airman soon, motherfuckers!) Montgomery is the new sheriff in town.  Or Deputy Marshall.  Or a wandering vigilante whose parents were killed my marauding League Cadets when he was just a wee lad.  But most likely I'm the yeoman.  *Does his little yeoman dance*
