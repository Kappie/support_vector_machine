I went to take a look at those mp3 players... there's alot... from creative to panasonic to philip to elson!!!  they are all simply too nice... the one that i wanted (the cheapest) Nomad Muvo TX... $199... cheap? with 128mb storage... haiz... but i can't afford it!!!  those mp3 players design oso quite nice... functions oso not bad... so for now, ppl who intended to buy discman, dun buy it anymore!!! go and buy mp3... it's worth the money...
