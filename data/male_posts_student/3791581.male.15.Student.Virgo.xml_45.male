And damn, the Southern folk know how to eat!   It took a few minutes for our heads to stop spinning at the sight of the endless selection.  But after we got our bearings, we certainly got our grub on.  Steak, fried chicken, rotissiere chicken, cornbread, baked potatoes with all the toppings, mashed potatoes with gravy, macaroni and cheese, salads, apple pie, peach cobbler - if it wasn't so delicious it would have been utterly disgusting.   With all that great southern comfort food, I don't know how most of the women around these parts can be Miss America perfect.  Atkins Diet?  What's that?  They've got great hair, perfect makeup, trendy clothes and all the right accessories, great shoes and a killer designer bag...and that southern twang!  Y'all come back now, ya hear!
