Now thinking on my full of drama life ( there's an eye opener and a really... and I mean REALLY big kick in my mouth for sayin' it ) I realized that is not all that easy to be a ***  boy in this town... sure I had my share of relations, and my family in their ignorant approach or conduct in their relation with me are happy and so am I, and grateful for it, but somehow it doesn't seems to make it all more easy on me.  I stay late ( and those who know me, know that when I said late is in the full extent of the word ) thinking all nights... I think in a way to be free of all of this or just a way to talk to everyone I care. Why? just don't know. Maybe just a way to make amends to the years that had passed me. Now I know that my social life has been neglected by me, not because of me. As I've said constantly, I just get too comfortable in this bubble... is warm, cozy but in the end or in the passing weeks, it just gets bigger and bigger and yes, oh so lonely... and for those who reads this sh** just have in mind that today I'm in such a good mood...!!!  Now I tried to expand my circle of friends, people to have so much more in common with, and not necessarily "that", but if it is that, just better... before I've tried to make a connection made by levels: first to be ***, then what else we could have in common... in all this years with that tactic I have just made friends with so many people I can count them with a bare and lonely hand... There was this time this person that I really liked... and he had all the qualities I was looking for, but this bubble in a way is stronger than me... I pushed him aside and in the end I never got the chance to know him the way no good christian intended what relations between two guys should be, heck, not even a coffee I took with him... now the guy is moving... and for me this brings memories... it is all that all over again ( something I'll tell u later ) minus the BIG STRONG feelings... I care for this bloke, don't get me wrong, I think we'd have made a great connection, but is not like there were *the big word that lifts everyone spirit* between us. Is more of what could have been... and for real, and with a cold head, this guy maybe would have never given me the hour... anyway... it could've been a great memory....  Now in a more real connection... I think I have been neglecting my friendship with one of my girls: Becka.... but the thing is that I've been really busy with school... she's there all afternoon, I am not, I just take a few classes with the group and some more in the morning... so I just go in and out... and don't have that much time to socialize ( duh!!! see what I mean: time - bubble )... I'll try to make it up to her... but I won't be that articulate 'cause it could set a precedent, and is not like I'm doing something wrong... OK, I should explain, as far as I know, and believe me, I know her, she probably is thinking that I'm giving her the cold shoulder... oh SO not the case..!!! So I'll take her to a movie and for some ice cream..... when I have some time.... hahahahah!!!!    see ya around....!!!
