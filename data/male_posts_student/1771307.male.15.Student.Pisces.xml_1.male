Self discovering is unlike science, the more you know about science, the more you will question about it; But for self discovery is that the more you know about yourself, the more you are confident in yourself, and the more you want to make out of this short life you have on earth.   I read my first post just now titled "going under", the title speaks for its content alot. I was in the state of despair then and I am sure this happens to everyone in different times. Just don't dwell in this kind of thinking too much, suicidal won't solve any of your problems, it just adds on to your parent's ever-growing burden, and it is not glamorous to die from a suicide. I don't know whether should I remove the negative post, perhaps it can serve as an example of how some pple feel.   Moving on, my O Levels Examination is creeping closing around the corner, it sneaks in and infiltrate my base without any warning. IfIdon't strengthen my defense and raise my alertness during this very dark hour, death is upon my way.  An advice to many of us here: we gotta have a purpose in our lives, know our aims well and steer towards the right direction, with priorities set in mind. Study hard not just merely for a brighter future, work hard not just to secure our rice bowl, think ahead of survival, think about winning and prospering.   Think about those who will be proud of us when we strive our best and achieve in different ways, be it mentionable or not. Work hard for somebody we love, make them proud, be it your God, parents, grandparents, lovers. These are the people who want to see you soar, and you yourself are accountable to them. Speaking from experience, it's more motivating to strive for someone than yourself in everything you do.   So, get a purposeful life, dare to move and ignore what people feel abou what you do. Remember that ultimately the choice is your- whehter you like it or not, you have a choice to make someday, may as well make it clear now
