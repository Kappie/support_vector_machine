Very cool, and creepy if you think about it for too long.  Especially when you visit their website:  www.zosoontour.com  And find out in the pictures section that everyone has the name of a band member, as if they are the real people.  Guitarist Joe Blow is called Jimmy Page.  Interesting.    Anyways, during one of the songs I started to wonder what a perfect day would be like.  And this is what I came up with:  -Wake up late, refreshed but tired from a strenious night of coitus with a special lady  -Enjoy more coitus  -Skip class, stay in bed, listen to Led Zeppelin on vinyl, enjoy coitus til I feel like taking a nap.  -Have a good nap  -snuggle (this last entry was placed by the lady)  Here's hoping it happens sooner than later
