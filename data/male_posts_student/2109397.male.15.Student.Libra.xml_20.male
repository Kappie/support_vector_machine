Seriously like that stupid Sprite doll thing, he is fucking annoying as fuck. And then there is all the wigger gear, FUBU, ECKO etc. why do white people wear that shit, FUBU means for us by us, and you know who makes it? So stop now. Another thing that contributes to this is Rap. Rap is very misunderstood. MTV stands for Music Television right, its a hipocracy because rap is NOT music in any form of the word. All it is is people yelling about their stupid beefs with other gangs rappers etc. FUCK THAT I really odnt think their little problesm are very relevant in the world and they should all just die. Fifty Cent is the leading one of these stupid assholes. Rap is degrading the quality of vocabulary in the world. Most black people are lazy so they come up with abbreviations for certain words and phrases, there fore they dont even talk in complete sentences. This carries over to rap music which a lot of people listen to which makes white people talk like that, with the exception of those who are individuals and actaually choose to listen to MUSIC and not follow the crowd. Evolution enters the picture and soon enough we will all be talking like that unless something is done. It just makes me mad that people think it is cool to be gangster, I hope they all die so the world is not ruined.
