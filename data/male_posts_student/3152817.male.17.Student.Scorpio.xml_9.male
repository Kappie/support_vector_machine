I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some mid level governmental functionary be it democrat or republican.   I'm in touch with my feelings and I like it that way d*** it!   I think owning a gun doesn't make you a killer, it makes you a smart American.   I think being a minority does not make you noble or victimized and does not entitle you to anything.   I believe that if you are selling me a big mac, try to do it in english.   I think fireworks should be legal on the 4th of July.   I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than working at blockbuster,in fact, if your parents are footing the bill to put your pansy a** through 4 years plus of college, you havent begun to be enlightened.   I believe everyone has a right to pray to his or her God when and where they want to   My heroes are John Wayne, Babe Ruth, Roy Rogers, and whoever cancelled Jerry Springer.   I dont hate the rich. I dont pity the poor.   I know wrestling is fake and I don't waste my time arguing about it.   I think global warning is a big lie. Where are all those experts now, when I'm freezing my a** off during these long winters and paying and paying and paying?   I've never owned a slave or was a slave, I didnt wander forty years in the desert after getting chased out of Egypt. I haven't burned any witches or been persecuted by the Turks and neither have you! So shut the h*** up already!   I want to know which church is it exactly where the Reverend Jesse Jackson practices, where he gets his money, and why he is always part of the problem and no the solution. Can I get an AMEN on that one?   I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry a** if you're running from them. I also think they have the right to pull your a** over if your breaking the law, regardless of what color you are.   I think if you are too stupid to know how a ballot works, I don't want you deciding who should be running the most powerful nation in the world for the next four years.   I dislike those people standing in the intersections trying to sell me crap or trying to guilt me into making "donations" to their cause. These people should be targets.   I believe that it take a village to raise a child, it takes two (heterosexual) parents .  I believe if she has her lips on your willie, its sex, and this applies even if you are the president of the United States (*cough* *cough* *Clinton* *cough* *cough*).   And what the h*** is going on with gas prices....again?   If this makes me a BAD American, then yes, im a BAD American    If you're a bad American too IM me w/ an AMEN.
