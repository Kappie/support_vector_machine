Then I managed to convince parents to let me go to STC with friends after leaving down their names and phone numbers. Josh must've asked me "can you go?" 5 times at least ^^;; and sorry to hoshi for putting up with all that silence while I scrambled to negotiate with my mom. Thanks to keane for providing the gift cert half a year ago, I finally put it to use...  too bad you weren't there though... =  Anyhow, right after lunch, normally I would be playing piano, then on the math, then watch TV (transformers and beyblade... yes I'm bored), but then I phoned keane and asked him about the bus route. Another thanks... I would've went the wrong way =\ Anyhow, the Finch bus was ok, but the Brimley bus was killer... waited for so long, and ended up 5 mins late! --;; Josh and Ken were there already.   First though, I made the same mistake as my sister, and went all the way to the roof where the GO trains were.. went back down, saw Carson's little group of people (Carson, Claire [Clarence], Tracy, Anne-Margareth, Lyris, Christopher, Shirley, and Brian Chen) and found out that Josh was already there.   After a good 35 mins of waiting, we finally met up with Orrin, Trisha and Hannah. Since we were so late, we had to wait another 2 and a half hours before we could see Tomb Raider.    That was spent by walking around, the music store was pretty cool, I got to play with the keyboard... ^^;; and trish was playing with the guitar. Oh, and I saw a bunch of people while walking around... a group of 11ers (one of which i knew from sat school), a niner from sat school, a group of niners (which stephan was part of, i asked him if he saw aiza..), some other 10ers (actually just Sam), Ana-sama, and some 9ers that helped with japanese pavilion for international night.    Pretty interesting, my theory is that since summer school just ended, everyone headed to STC.. either that or they spend a lot of time there =P    Now for the actual movie. It was ok.. better than the first one IMO, but still, lack of plot is not my type. I rate it 3 out of 5.    I was way over the time I said I'd be home... luckily enough, they didn't seem too mad, and Orrin was kind enough to drive me home... thanks Orrin ^^;;    Managed to learn a few things about people today, like how someone broke up with someone, and someone wanted to avoid some other person because of something, and how someone was not there because that person was with someone else somewhere else, and how someone was mad at someone because of something. I don't want to list any names or specific events, I'm sure you guys understand ^^   ~Chronos
