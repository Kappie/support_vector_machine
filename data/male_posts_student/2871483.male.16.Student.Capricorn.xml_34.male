On Saturday, went to aunt and uncle's garage sale, helped out, made a few bucks.  Had a really nice dinner.  Went home, worked four another four hours, thus cleaning up my room.  Sunday, woke up, mowed the lawns, went to Quiznos, came home, ate, and worked for another four or five hours, vacuming and moving my bed and other various possesions into my new room.  -  Mom came home today.  I'm kinda pleased.  However, I kinda liked just having one parent bugging me, then again, whenever one leaves, the other forces us to work to death.  Double edged, so they say.  -  I enjoy living in this room.  It is bigger, the computer's here, there are some chairs, TV, balcony with a great view.  All I did was add my bed, and it was perfect.  -  I am sooooooooo ready for an easy week.  Except for Monday, in which I must write that paper for Klaas and do that newsletter for Cranny.  I have a lot of tests, but those go by fast.  Wednesday is early release, which pisses me off because the band festival is then, and it usually works as a great way to miss class, but instead we're going right after school ends, and then we come back at about 2:30!  ARGH.  No school on Friday, pretty sweet deal, because then we've got spring break, unless I'm off by a week.  -  Spring break will be all about laziness for me.  I will sleep in, rent a few games I've been meaning to play, sleep some more.  Eat some fast food, etc, etc, etc.  It will be so awsome.  -  I should be sleeping right now, but, as usual, insomnia clicks in when I need to get to sleep, so I'll most likely be awake 'til about three or four, if not the whole night.  I need a snack.
