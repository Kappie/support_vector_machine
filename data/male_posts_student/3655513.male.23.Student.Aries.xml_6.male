Digital media copyright enactment. So many people are uninformed and misled by the popular media about this topic. It's even stereotypical to hear comments like "file sharing is wrong" or "isn't that illeagal?" And after the most recent rounds of RIAA bullying the common consumer and internet user, people just get the wrong perceptions altogether about things like MP3s, DIVX and XVID versions of Hollywood feature flicks, copied PC software, etc.  You want to know my viewpoints? Then ask me!  imtherooster@gmail.com  Rooster
