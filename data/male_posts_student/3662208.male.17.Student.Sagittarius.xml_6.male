But anyway, as soon as I talk to Farrah (my girlfriend) one more time, I'm leaving. I'm going to go to Virginia. Maybe staying with my sister for a while will let things blow over. Not too mention I make money off of her sometimes and it will help me pay for my 90$ phone bill from calls to Farrah. Unfortunately, she's long distance. Isn't that fucked? Same area code yet...it's long distance. BULL SHIT I SAY! Apparently my opinion doesn't matter to the phone company. So, I'm out for right now.
