Many have access to non-potable river water that is currently being used maybe be contaminated with chemicals and/or bacteria. Therefore, the AWECA Foundation has coordintated the drilling of several wells to support rural Aeta villages who have currently compromised water sources. Clean sources of water are important for increasing community capacity because it reduces issues concerning poor health. Stakeholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (coordinate the drilling) 2) Government participation (as needed however I believe the current deep wells were created through private donors) 3) Private Donors (source for supplies and money for the deep well) 4) Aeta Villagers (the recipients of the deep wells).  Would be interesting to conduct a before and after health survey to see if the deep wells made any health impacts on the lives of the Aeta villagers.
