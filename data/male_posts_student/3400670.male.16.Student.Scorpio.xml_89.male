The morning after pill or emergency contraception either prevents an egg from being released, or creates an unhospitable environment in the uterus to prevent implantation the same way that birth control pills, shots, and patches work.  The defenition of pregnancy is the implantation of a fertilized egg into the uterus.  I repeat, the morning after pill DOES NOT abort a pregnancy and there are plenty of on-line resources to back that up.  The pill is useful for unplanned intercourse including rape or condom breakage.  Studies show no harmful side effects, but unfortunately, the FDA decided (against surgeon general recommendation) that emergency contraception not be sold over-the-counter because of the lack of specific directions for use.  With any luck, that problem will be remedied and EC will hit the shelves hell-bent on protecting against unwanted pregnancy.  Write to your congressmen to speed up the process.  Love, Rob
