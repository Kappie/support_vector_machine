We have planned this for a long time. It was good to see each other. Most of the time, we just walked around and chatted about stuff.   It was funny. When Matt and I were walking in this one part of the mall, this Asian lady stopped me specifically and asked me for directions to a pizza place in the plaza. It was funny because she totally ignored Matt who was a white guy and went for me probably for my asian-ness. I guess Matt kinda felt weirded out by the whole thing.      urlLink PICTURE.
