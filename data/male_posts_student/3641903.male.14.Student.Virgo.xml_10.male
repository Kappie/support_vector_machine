It started of when i woke up at 6am, for god knows why, because my parents told me to put my alarm clock at 6am, so i went to eat breakfast with them, then arrive at Amoy Quee about 15minutes earlier, we went in and as usual SEA is the most worst one, we drew the arms from the amoury, then went to practice our drills, after that we took a bus to get to SAFTI MI, i was sleeping in the bus, but at the same time i had to wake up sometimes, because my rifle kept on slipping out of my hand, so in actual fact i was only half asleep, hahahahahahahahaha. ok so we arrived at SAFTI MI and had our lunch, our luch so far was the best we had compared to the rest, we had western food and ice-cream. After that we went to the dam big parade square, had soem rehersals, slack a bit though, hahahahahahahaha and then we also had to practce a wet rehersal where we went into this hall and was told not to stamp o the floor or it might fall with the combine force of everybodies stamping, the only contingent was the Guard of honour contingent. well we then rested for a while, rehydrated ourselves and had to change, i was the only idiot who stuffed his no.1 uniform in the bag because my uniform cover was stolen by someone, i don't know who, so i was feeling dam inferior to everyone because my rank was a coporal and almost everyone had at least one badge in their uniform, but i later grdually felt more comfortable, because there were part B's whose rank was smaller then mine and had no badge so it was not at all that bad. So it was the moment we have all been waiting for, the moment we rehersed so long for, so we marched out as the Guard of Honour for the Sea district. God was not on our side that day, because we stood there for like i don't know maybe 1 hour or so, the sun was dam hot and my feet as killing me and my whole body was dam numb, the only movement we had was the presenting of arms and the wriggling of our toes which the spectatos could not see. So when the moment came for the march pass, it was a sigh of relief, at last finally the parade was going to be over, so we did the march pass, but the last part we screwed it up because we could not hear the RSM command for our heads to turn back to the original position, that part was a screw up, but in my opinion the whole parade was a success. We then gathered to the FUP and hydrated ourselves and took pictures at the same time, we were then given the confetti shooter or something and were told that at the grand finale, we were to run as fast as we could and make the whole place as messy as possible. So the moment came we stood in position and all of us charged forward with our rifles. The marits then all gathered at the place near where all the NCC coucil people were sitting and made a lot of noise and took our school flag, our part b's were allowed to join us, we jumped around like a bunch of mad people, also raising our rifles in the air and son on, then the national anthem was played and we stood in attention and sang the national anthem dam loudly, that moment was a moment i would never forget in my life, i will never trade anything for it, i wish i can relieve that moment again. so after the parade we went o return our arms, said goodbye to our Bukit Batok friends we made then gave Jonathon who will be leaving the US by next week or so, we are all going to miss him though. so we stayed back and help load the arms in the truck, then went for the reception for some refreshments and food. we were like the zai gor in there as our uniform was then best over there, oh i love my no.1 we also meet Sir Wong Kim Sim and Sir Domanic Tan of the pioneer batch of the Barracudas, we ended up going back at about 8pm. that day was the most memoriable time of my life, i will never trade anything for that moment. ok well i am also suppose to write about today also, well i went to school, made sherman lifes miserable, he snapped, told DK made a whole hooha out of it, but he actually dosen't know he is falling way down to my trap, muhahahahahahaahahahahaha, ok well Koh Siang Chen said she was disturbed by the fact that i am very scheming, but i told her the reason for my actions, i think she understood my situation. well history lesson we werte taught about the Ubited Nations, after that Mr. Wong played the role of the United Nations by trying to mediate for us and try to solve the problem, but i tell you the problem won't be slove so easily, my brain has hatch a plan, becausre i see no reason in what way i am wrong, because i am treating him the same way he is treating me, so we both are on par. This incident has raised the attention of our class alright, but i tell you one thing, the whole class know i am the one that is right, because a lot of people in our class don't like sherman as they say he is very proud. well now i have achieve something though, it has made the teachers don't like sherman as i have shown them who he realy is muhaahahahahahahahahahahaahhaahhahahahahhahahahhahaha ok so i will end it here, but one of the most freaky thing is that i don't know who reads my blog, but i don'tt know how my aunt found the address for my blog, i gotta go solve that, ok so i will end it here because i just got back form my maths tution at my cousin's house dam tired, but i still have to study, ok i will end it here now ok bye!
