This one will be a little tedious cuz if you don't know it is tiring and somewhat boring writing these extended blogs night in and night out.  But they do "cause pleasure" for Tyke in the long run.  Ok, Tyke wrote that last line 15 minutes ago cuz Macaroon just called him and they were talking for a while.  Tyke had to sorta defend himself cuz of one of his decisions during the day.  Even though it wasn't his fault but whatever, you'll hear in a bit.  1st period=gay today.  It wasn't too bad but the teacher is a fucking douchebag.  She is soooo stupid.  2nd period was fine and Tyke was owning everyone in his groups in squats and other leg stuff.  He was just pounding out the reps like it was nothing.  Sure he was only repping 165 but still, he does have pretty good legs.  That's why he can get up on his leaps.  3rd period was cool and the rest of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was pretty good.  At least the ending was funny.  And the Boy Rangers part.  Man, that is pretty messed up what those guys did to the Boy Rangers.  4th period was fun.  It was poetry reading day.  Tyke read 3 haikus.  He read his first two after Amed went.  The former of Tyke's two poems seemed to get a nice outcry from the peanut gallery as it was about his wanton.  Then he decided to just read those two and sat back down to savor the intellectual stimuli that were to be read.  Some were pretty good he thought.  After everybody went Tyke was pressured into reading some of his dirtier ones.  He read the "Elongated Shaft" one and right after the teacher said, "Tyke, I think I feel a theme in your poems."  Tyke took this as a hint that she was trying to censor him so he left the "Virgin tongues in lust" haiku in his pocket and was pleased with the reactions of the class.  He at least showed more of his creative side and humorous view on life if nothing else.  For lunch Tyke went with the gang to Pie and got some damn good cheese pizza.  That ish is hott!  Ekul was there and Tyke talked to him for a bit and he challenged Tyke to another game but this time they had their original player back on their squad so they wanna play.  Well, Tyke said he would be willing to play as he just loves the game.  So this time Tyke is going to pick the court and he will probably pick a new third player to join him and Kinker.  They are definitely going to play on a 10' hoop though.  Tyke stipulated that at the girls basketball game he went to with Purdy at night.  For some reason the Sly Lioners are afraid of the 10' monster in their face so Tyke is going to have to whip it out and beat them with it.  Such a great line right there.  Who knows who the Quah will pick for their final member of the Trio of Dominance though.  It could be most anyone.  Tyke has already improved since last time and his skills on the 10' hoop are much better than a wet 8 footer.  So the game will be a classic again.  Perhaps the comm center for the locale.  It worked well for Tyke last time.  He would like to play on a different court though.  He would love to just play at the court by his house.  That would be something.  The rim is super freaky hard.  It bounces everything out but Tyke knows it pretty well.  And the court is decent too.  And it is by Tyke's house so that makes it better too.  But all will be decided soon.  After school Tyke was called by Macaroon and he offered a game of hoops up on Coug Mount but Tyke didn't really want to drive up there knowing that he would have to come all the way back in not too long and he still had to write a paper.  Even though he didn't think he was going to the girls game that night he still wanted to get it done.  So he declined.  Well then Purdy told him that she was in fact going to make it to the girls game so he decided that since he already had like 5/7 of it done he might as well get out of the house and hang out with some girls (mainly just to hang out with a bunch of girls).  The game was fun even with the freaky Sly Lion dads sitting in front of Tyke, Purdy, and Tina.  This one guy had mad dandruff (mandruff) and not to mention he kept licking himself like he was a cat.  It was freaky.  Purdy kept putting her finger like right by the mandruff and it was freaking out Tyke.  Then she got elbowed by the Cat Man when he started jumping up and down and feeling up some fellow fathers around him.  It was a scary time but still fun.  Scary=fun in some cases.  Other times it equals horrible.  But not often.  Or like maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of the time.  Somewhere in there.  Tyke came home though at 7:02 and this was the first odd revelation to him.  He opened the door and all of the freaking lights were out!!!  And it was only 7:02!!!  His parents had already called it a night at 7.  That is just weird.  Tyke goes to bed around 11 every night and gets up at about 6 every morning.  And he is still sorta growing so he needs sleep way more than his parents.  However he will acknowledge the fact that on many occasions his mom gets about 2 hours of sleep cuz of work.  That is a frequent occurrence.  The other odd thing was that Tyke saw a message from Macaroon saying something along the lines of, "thanks for ditching me you ungrateful bastard."  Along those lines.  Well, Tyke not only didn't mean to ditch him but he didn't even make an effort to ditch him like he will occasionally do if he is really trying to ditch someone (which never happens).  But really, there is nothing there as the two are still friends and all and they hang out like all the time.  But anyway, Tyke still needs to finish his paper and print it off so hope you enjoyed double blog day.  Maybe it was even better than double stamp day!  Probably not though.
