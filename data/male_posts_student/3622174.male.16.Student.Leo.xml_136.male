This month's special feature is "Camp Orlando 2004," which has all of the pictures that I took during Camp Orlando (see Nerdular Nerdance: July 2004 for more information).  This includes pictures and stories and things that I did not post during the Nerdular Nerdance event when I came back from camp.  So, be sure to check it out!  I'll have the link to Mobagel (Mobile Bagel, since I can post pictures from anywhere).   Also today, I'll be starting my Photoshop blog, getting that ready.  I'll only post there once or twice a week, since school will limit the time that I will have in Photoshop.  Get ready for some awesome stuff though, because I'm taking my Photoshop skills to the next level.  Only the best stuff that I create will be allowed to pass through the blog.  You'll get tips, tricks, and information on how I did each of the things that I create.   That's it from me for now.  I'm going to go finish getting Mobagel ready.  It shall launch today.
