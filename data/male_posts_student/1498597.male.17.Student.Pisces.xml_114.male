Well, I'll post a little something then...  Our contest (ok, the contest that I thought up of and tried to get going on the site) ended quite some time ago. Hardly anyone submitted anything to us. Perhaps we should have another contest then? ha ha. I know that you are all shaking your heads in disagreement at this point. I just want to get people to come to our site and see what things that  JR and I  have to say!  The main reason we haven't been blogging is due to  school . The big bad school is playing an integral role in our "not-being-able-to-blog" problem. Yet, tomorrow is Friday (which we have off) so maybe  JR  will blog then? Who knows! Its like "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop?"....... the world may never know! ha ha  Ok then! This was just a short update brought to you by....... keyboards! If we didn't have keyboards, then you wouldn't be reading this!  Stay tuned!
