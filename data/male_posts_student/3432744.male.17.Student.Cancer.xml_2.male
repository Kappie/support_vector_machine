I'm on edge with a few people and tommorow is supposed to be a huge thing for our large group.  I frankly don't like, nor want to be with, the group.  I have maybe four-six friends in there out of fifteen+ kids and the rest of them just have started to annoy me to death.  They've got a big secret planned for tommorow (which I know but am not at liberty to say :D) but I really don't feel like going.  A friend, and also another ex-girlfriend (that's a topic for later on tonight or tommorow though :D), is saying that I'll get shunned if I don't go.  I'm already shunning the majority of them so that's no big deal.   I hate all this inner conflict and confusion.  Just messes me up in the end.  ah well, I'll post about whether or not I participate in it tommorow :D.  On a personal note: It's dawned on me.  Jenn, I know you'll see this :D.  Why can't I get my thing after 2nd period or something?  Why do I  NEED  to be there after school?  I'll explain more online.  Anywho, personal issues over.  The Internet now knows I have a friend named Jenn :D.  'Later Andy
