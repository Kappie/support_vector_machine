My mate, Heather, told me to make this blog diary thing, shes sort of obsessed with me and needs to know everything I do, me being the kind, warm guy that I am, obliged :P  Well, at the moment I'm on Study Leave. My first exam is next friday, its on Maths Mechanics. ITS SOLID! I don't get hardly any of it, and will most probably get a D or E in it. Going to have to revise loads for it.  I recently got broadband (yeah yeah, I finally got it :D), but the damn thing won't work. The modem keeps flashing saying its waiting for a ADSL Signal, even hoguh the connection has been enabled by BT. My cousin is coming over tonight so hopefully he can sort it out for me, if not, he shall be having words with my ISP. (He's good at scaring people on telephones! lol)  This morning, I woke up at around 10am, and I went for a jog! I have been trying to get into an exercise regime for a while (around 6 months), but today it begun. I went for a little 15 minute jog, woohoo, but I was well tired after it, my heart was beating like a rapid drum.  From tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and do 30 press ups, 50 sit ups, then the jog, come back in and do 20 press ups, and 20 sit ups. I will do this EVERY morning for atleast the next 2-3 weeks. I can honestly say I'm not looking forward to it.  I'mabout to do some research for my Design Technology exam, and then I shall watch Eastenders! I can't stand Andy on it - he's worse than me! Glad to hear Janine is going down for a year, and EURGH, when will Vicky finally disappear?  Currently listening to: Michael Jackson - Stranger in Moscow.
