It is so easy to make or critique our past and qualify it as a mistake.  I have never really understood the quote..."we must remember our past so we aren't condemned to repeat it ."  We will never be able to repeat the past...it is so different...however we continue to behave as humans do? How can we repeat something that is so different - or do we repeat the same instances with superior technology.     "Under God" - did you know they added that phrase in the 50s during the cold war?  America's rally around Freedom...Goodness and Godliness...Cold War propaganda?   I enjoyed reading your blogs - What are your thoughts on America's decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    Prediction: On the fifty year anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education (1954) - Portland will host a major racial riot....Topic "TALK"  See you tommorow
