Now I begin to sing the lyrics, thou I don't dare raise my voice to high, in fear of alerting my mother. Hm the funny thing is I have no idea why I'm typing this now. I suppose I'm just bored, or out of my mind. Either way I'm fine with that. I do belive I'm going to silence myself now.  *Softly sings the lyrics to this song*
