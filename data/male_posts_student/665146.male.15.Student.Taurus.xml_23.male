"In The Futurological Congress (1971), Polish writer Stanislaw Lem portrayed a future in which disobedience is controlled with hypothetical mind-altering chemicals dubbed "benignimizers". Lem's fictional work opens with the frightening story of a police and military biochemical attack on protesters outside of an international scientific convention. As the environment becomes saturated with hallucinogenic agents, in Lem's tale the protesters (and bystanders) descend into chaos, overcome by delusions and feelings of complacency, self-doubt, and even love.  If the Pentagon's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) has its way, Lem may be remembered as a prophet."  In other words, heroin addicts rejoice!  Go to a protest and have the worst trip of your life!!!  I hope I'm not the only one scared by this.  A number of wackos want to create crowd-control weapons that not only stop "riots", but cause all those in the line of fire to go on something not different from a heroin trip that would send the target to the seventh circle of Hell...    The teams making the weapons are working on a number of psychiatric and anesthetic pharmaceuticals (such as the date rape drug........).  According to the report, "the choice administration route, whether application to drinking water, topical administration to the skin, an aerosol spray inhalation route, or a drug filled rubber bullet, among others, will depend on the environment."  Why don't the cops just throw a giant rave every time a riot breaks out?    I'll look at it positively.....  May'be the drugs will have a better effect on society and allow potentially dangerous situation to be safe...........   "As of March 2002, the team was researching a mix of pepper spray ("OC") and an unidentified calmative agent. Pepper spray is the most powerful chemical crowd control agent in use, and has been associated with numerous deaths."    Never mind..........  I'll stick with my first view.......    Go America........  We have the most complicated drug laws, don't we?   To see the real version of what was talking about and not just a tiny plagiarism, go  urlLink here
