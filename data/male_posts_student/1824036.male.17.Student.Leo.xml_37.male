I saw Hardcore Holly beating Big Slow in a street fight (highlites from Smackdown! anyways), and I also saw Los Guerreros breaking up. Looks like a good time. Too bad I have to miss it.  By the way all Drew has carried a load in here for a while, therefore I gave him a couple weeks off for vacation :)
