We took a fuking long time to finish 2 games... -.-" But it was fun though, except that Darius was sitting there like a retard, making me feel bad. >.  Anyway, after Billiard, we went BK and ate the WHOPPER MEAL ~ $3.90 for the meal. Cheap stuff. Owned. We stayed there for like 1 hours chilling and talking crap until some chix came and we decided to give up our seats to them. But a group of guys snatched the seats away. Nubs. Feeling prety tired, we took 171 and made our way to Darius's house to chill and stay over. Coolass. Love it when we three stay over somewhere. All we had was fun, fun and more FUN!!!     After having our dinner, we decided to try setting up a hi-fi system near the pool at Darius's house. It was a success. The music was like.... surround sound. Cool. We then decided to go for a swim in the pool with the blasting music. While swimming, Darius found a dusty, old float that's still usable. We had fun with it, doing all kind of stunts with it in the pool. As a result, we suffered injuries and nearly "died". Lol.   We went to wash up after the swim and I used Darius's com to play SG and stay online after Darius logged on to his dumbass Odia and blah blah blah... JH came online and then chatted with her (I need to know her better. =/) for like 1 hour before I went into the room and sleep with the boys. I mean, sleeping with no gayness among us. ^^ We talked for a while before we all entered our Dreamland.   Woke up this morning and saw Darius playing his stooopid DA. He played for like 3 hrs before I took over and played my SG. >.  School's starting tml. Sux2bme. I have to face all those ppl that I hate for another 5 days again. Well, at least I still have 4 good pals to accompany me throughout the week. Lol. Looking forward to have fun with my good pal soon...  Lastly and most importantly, LIFE ROX WITH SC AND DARIUS.
