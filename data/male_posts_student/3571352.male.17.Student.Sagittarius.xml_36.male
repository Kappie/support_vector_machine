If you think Michael Moore is a "good guy" then you should be ashamed of yourself!  If you do your research he had some Anti-American propaganda a few days after 9/11/01.  I highly suggest  DOWNLOADING  Fahrenheit 9/11 because it is not worth paying for.   He is making money off of his Anti-American movie!   I would also suggest checking out this Pro-America movie and watch some  urlLink O'Reilly Factor  on the FOX news channel.  Sorry I just had to vent.. BTW if you were just wondering about Fahrenheit 9/11 its 57% done with 45 minutes left. ;-)
