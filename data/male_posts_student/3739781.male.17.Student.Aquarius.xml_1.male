I had family fly in from all around the country, New York, Florida, and California, and then one drove here fromKentucky for me! We had a giant party where all my family from in town came to visit, and some of my favorite teachers came to see me off. Everyone was very generous with there gifts, and now I can say that I will be able to go on the 3 trips that rotary is taking us on in throughout the year.    One sad note   Only one time before this party I have had a downer, but the second hit for the first time two days ago, when I was saying my final goodbye to my brother. A feeling I have never had before. Words can't explain the feeling. It was partial sadness, part goodbye, part will I ever see you again, and part wow, I'm going to Thailand, and I'm leaving my family behind.   REVAMPED LIFESTYLE  One person made me feel whole again. This kid is one who I can actually talk to, and know he would never tell a soul what I say. We actually talked to each other and funny how things seem but we are on the exact same page with our other friends. Some are cool, some are getting on our nerves and some are just changing.  We were able to just have fun as well, we went to the video store and played Frisbee in the parking lot (very unsuccessful try, it was far too windy for my Frisbee). But then we went out and we borrowed a sign from and undisclosed place for me to take to Thailand. It was fun. And I actually was having a really good time, which has been hard for me to do in the last few weeks.   Well I must go now, keep checking back for updates!
