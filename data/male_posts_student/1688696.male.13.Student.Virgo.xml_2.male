She's over at Emily Townsend's house. Yeah and she says hello. Now my h/s friend Katy keeps IMing me and calling me which would usually bug me but I'm ignoring it I guess. Yeah and again I find myself missing Alyssa. I was supposed to go to the movies today with her and Emily but eh, Emily couldn't go so Alyssa went to Em's house and they might be coming over tomorrow. I hope she does, cause uhh yeah. Anyways she laughed really hard and got herself all dizzy and felt like she was going to blackout and that got me all worried and what-not. Anyway yeah since Alyssa was talking about it, Yellowcard, Ocean Avenue.    There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise  Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away
