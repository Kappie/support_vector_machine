We ate breakfast very fast, I even have to run here to time-record HZGG. How busy!!  At 11, Father came back and we went there lor. My parents want to bring my brother there to see her, in case there are no other chances. Meow moo. Woah! The carpark spaces during Sunday is abundant. Such a shocker. I thought on Sunday everybody is resting and would come to visit their relatives. When we went up, there were a lot of cats registering. Looks like they came by public transport instead. Heh. I was delgeted by some nurse to register for my whole family. O.O Meow meow. I noticed that their temperature sticker change color. I've got green, purple and white. I wonder what else do they have.  Anyway, we saw MaMa. Bak Liong and Yee Pak Pak were there too. MaMa refused to eat again...she is refusing to eat these few days. I think she is trying to avoid the amputation. She rejected to it in the first place ma, who would want to lose a leg? She's protesting, not eating, so the operation wouldn't go on. Either that, or she's tired of living (I know, harsh. That's the most diplomatic I can go...). That's what I analyzed anyway. Hmmm. Do you know that 5551 came out 3rd in 4D yesterday? MaMa's ward is 5A (51), in the 5th floor and is resting on bed 5. Some relatives brought and struck. Numbers associating from people's misfortune always strike. Meow!! Hmmmm. I found out that Yee Pak Pak knows a lot about the other patients and their visitors around MaMa. HaHa. MaMa only drank Milo lor. I found out (from a bit of peeking at files) that MaMa was fed glucerina as medicine. Sigh...she's not eating. How can that be good for her? Sigh.   We left at 1 and went towards AMK Ave 5. The big market-cum-hawker center is open! YAY!! I wanna see got my favorite black chicken rice and gu meen (mushroom soup, dong gu mian). Black chicken rice didn't open, but gu meen did! Gu meen is spendidly delicious (even though it was a tad too peppery). Meow mooo! The delicious dong gu is to die for! After that, we went to AMK Central to get my brothers some shoes.   I went home to bath and meow online, while the rest of the family went to buy new sporting equipment for my brother. They brought back chicken for dinner. After some meowing surfing, I ate my dinner and came back online lor.   Hmm. I think I go le la. I want to play FFX. Heh Heh. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
