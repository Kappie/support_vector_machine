(i mean, its not like seb cares bout being the responsibilities or not..she just wants the title).    i havent buy twins latest cd "girl power" yet...im kinda broke this month...spent too much on cell phone and...i cant even remember how i spent my money but....i so want that cd!! the imported one! im so gonna buy it!!   i know this song is kinda old, (im sorry for not being updated with the latest thing in music industry) but i really really love the song "the reason is u" by hoobastank! its so so SO meaningful! besides that, another song which is stuck in my head is an oldies which is "reunited" by Peaches and herbs. i really love that song...its awesome.    i havent been to the cinemas lately...i wanna watch "three of a kind" by miriam and sean. i also wanna watch "kill bill vol. 2". i love the first volume and im sure the second will be as good...or maybe better..although oo-renshi is dead.  hmm..thats all i guess. love u ppl! and nitey..
