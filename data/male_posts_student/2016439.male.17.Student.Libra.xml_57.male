I knew that it wouldn't until after I did the thing at the VA Hospital with the Young Marines, and it won't really start feeling like it until Monday afternoon after we do a flag-placing ceremony at a local cemetery.  Even though I'll still have to get up at about 4:30 in the morning to do that, I don't care.  After that, summer will have officially begun.  I'm excited about being busy.  Music camp and band yesterday was fun, if nothing else than for the sheer fact that Mr. Um now refers to my class as seniors.  Too cool for words.  As far as how we sound, well...we're not as bad as I thought we would be, but we have a lot to make up for in the maturity department.  Nothing like a stampede of freshmen whenever the pizza man delivers to the band hall.  Come on, folks.  Get a grip.  The not-as-fun-part-but-still-kind-of-fun part was cleaning up afterwards.  Yeah, walking around picking up stuff that you can't even rightfully identify isn't too cool, but it was just a small group of us, so it worked out.  I think I'm actually going to enjoy being drum major this year.  It's not that I didn't last year, but I feel that I'll enjoy it more now that I'll be able to take on more responsibility.  Yeah.  We also went to graduation last night, and for the most part I thought it was horrible.  I got incredibly sick of the endless screaming and noisemakers (despite The Administration's announcement not to have either since it was supposed to be a "formal" event) as well as of playing  Pomp and Circumstance  for three or four times through.  In fact, I got tired of playing altogether.  No wonder I didn't check out a horn to take home this summer.  There  was  one part of the ceremony that I did enjoy, and that was the song that the choir sang.  I always love to listen to our school's select choirs (especially the older ones) sing because they really are incredible.  The song they sang was pretty, but not quite as sad as I had hoped for.  Nevertheless, it was quite enjoyable, as was seeing several of my friends (it was only at graduation that I realized how few I actually have in the Class of 2004) walk across the stage.  Good luck, guys.  I know you'll all be the future Bill Gates, Oprah Winfreys, Arnold Schwarzaneggers, and Monica Lewinskys of our great country.  Just don't forget your friends back home who still have a year left to endure!
