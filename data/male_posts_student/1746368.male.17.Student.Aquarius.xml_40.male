It sounds like someone laughing. *END NOTE*  [09:53:44] edicius2002: so, how bout them lakers?? [09:54:14] ME: i hear they will go to the superbowl this year ;) [09:54:18] ME: with all them homeruns they are scoring [09:54:21] edicius2002: lol [09:54:23] ME: its a wonder that that goalie is still alive [09:54:28] edicius2002: LOL [09:55:02] ME: i think that they will win the pennant [09:55:08] edicius2002: LOL [09:55:28] ME: their skillz can not be beaten by those raiders [09:55:38] ME: and i dont even know why they bother playing the giants [09:55:39] edicius2002: LMAO man [09:56:10] ME: the giants try shooting baskets [09:56:21] ME: but the lakers block and come back for the hat trick [09:56:31] edicius2002: LOL [09:56:45] ME: and wayne gretzky? PSHH [09:56:51] ME: no match for that kobe [09:56:52] edicius2002: lol man [09:57:11] ME: did you see when kobe did that kickflip over tony? [09:57:16] ME: i mean, it was all over espn [09:57:18] ME: and espn 2 [09:57:20] ME: and espn 3 [09:57:22] edicius2002: LOL [09:57:30] ME: i mean, he was like mario [09:57:32] ME: busting out with the jumps [09:58:23] ME: and then kobe did that triple lutz past deon sanders for the touchdown and they won the game at the end of the third period [09:58:41] edicius2002: LMAO  *LATER*  [10:12:53] ME: i was about to say...did you see when barry bonds caught the snitch with his teeth? [10:13:04] edicius2002: haha [10:13:32] ME: that put the lakers against the orioles 150-love [10:13:47] edicius2002: LOL  This actually does have some meaning to it. It pretty much shows that I have no regard for sports and I think there are so many of them that it's just stupid to try to follow any of them. The only one that would be worth following would be Quidditch. Well good night everybody. Don't never use a double negative in a sentence.
