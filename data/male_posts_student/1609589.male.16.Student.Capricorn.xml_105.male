Not a thought in the world, just emotion... doesn't happen very often...  Kind of a feeling that I'm alone... everything seems so far away right now...  I could just be feeling lightheaded because I'm sleepy, but i don't know, i still think i have normal judgement...  I imagine i am feeling around how people feel when they have those real eye-opening experiences, where nothing in the world matters except what it's like they meant to focus on... except I have nothing to focus on...  I guess i'm focusing on the lyrics to this song, but i don't see any connection... Maybe it's some of those words that stick with you for a long time... until you find their meaning, could be days, could be weeks, months, years later, then either they float away like all other memories, or become even more important.... becoming an important factor on the way your life turns out.  I guess I won't know tonight...  I guess I should also note that the words aren't the only factor, the music is probably the biggest factor in getting that emotion...  If you want to hear what I am talking about, find/download  Venus Hum- Wordless May . Trust me- if you stop what you're doing it, and just listen, hopefully you'll hear it the way I do.  -snider.  P.S. I'm not becoming christian. Just because the word jesus is in a song doesn't make it christian. Muslims believe in jesus. And they're not christian. I don't want to deal with you converters right now.
