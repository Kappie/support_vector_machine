A list of worries.   1.) My social studies Final. What am I going to do? How will I do it? Where will I gather my research? These questions have plagued me so. But I think I have it down. I shouldn't worry so much about this, but since it is due in a week, I have put it as my number one concern for the moment.   2.) I guess I've beat this subject down to a bloody pulp, especially with Charlotte upon such matters, I have to jot this down incase I lose it. What will I get for my esteemed Matty. For a going away present. I presented him with my idea of getting him something. I asked him what he wanted or needed for his voyage to the known (as opposed to unknown). He took my suggestion and threw it away. We argued for some time. He did not want me to get him anything. And I'm a stubborn nice jerkface who cannot be told otherwise. "Why are you fighting me?" and so forth, "All I want are memories." and the usual, "I'll take your gift and give it back to you, I won't accept it.". What am I to do?   I have decided upon one article in my gift montage. Charlotte had told me to give him something special, something new, and something of mine.(actually, I don'tknow ifCharlotte actuallytold me those things, but I will credit/blameher for them anyway. I have a lousy memory!) I already have the something special and something of mine, I just need the something new. And I think I have decided. I will buy him  Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie . The reason for this is that our relationship is based upon the idea that we want to fly away to some place other than here. Bora Bora, to be exact. It's also based upon the principle that we shall never forget. Wendy never forgot Peter, I think.   It's been too long since I've read the book, but I will buy it for him. In hardcover, if possible. Anyone want to take a trip to the mall with me?   3.) I need to get a job. My money is fast dwindling and pretty soon I will be left nothing but the money I need to spend on car insurance and various other payments. It seems my childhood has left me. An allusion to Peter Pan.   4.) My grades. I need to bring my English grades up. I don't know how to fix it. We don't get anything. I am mad at the lack of learning and the lack of chances. What will colleges think? That I slacked off in that class? I hope not. Because I have not had anything to slack off on! No matter, I find it ironic that I have an extremely good grade in Social Studies, Ms. Kobyrinski's class, in which I complain (used to anyway) about how boring and bad it is. How Ms. K did not teach, yet I enjoy that class more. Chemistry is okay. I cannot wait until next year when my interest in chemical and bioligical science is tested. Maybe not a concern but a growing point inside my mind.   5. ) I don't know. I had a good one here but I seem to have forgotten it. Fine, I'll give one of my general concerns. What will happen tomorrow? The day after that? What will I be like when I'm 25? 35? 45? Will I be happy? Or will I be dead? Who will I still see? Who will I lose forever, lost in the sea of memories in which I cannot be sure if they really had existed or not or that am I just a prisoner of illusions here in my padded cell.    No matter. Life goes on. And one by one, I shall cross of each worry and smooth each wrinkle in my life until it is nothing short of perfection. Whenever that is.   Happy Trails.
