After my appointment Grace and I had lunch at Blue Mesa (holy shit they have a buffet now), then walked around West Village for a while. Also finally got my hair cut. Oh and we tried to get tickets for "O" but apparently it's not showing until the 18th, so we just went ahead and got tickets for Mystere. I've seen it before but think Grace would really like it. Being broke really sucks.
