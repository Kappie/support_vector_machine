The people are a bit insane, you don't know what is going on, and it has Jimmy Stewart, He's on of the best. Great movie though. It's the kind of thing me and my friends would get together and watch at midnight. Then talk about until 4 in the morning. I'd be so tired after that.                  I let time run away last night, and i need to compensate for yesterday's lack of sleep. Tomorrow looks more promising for something cool to happen. Like a giant storm or something. That'd be awesome. Out for now.
