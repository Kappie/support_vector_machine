And from the pictures I've seen, I assumed Duke would be no problem to locate...just off the interstate, maybe nestled a mile away, with a murder's row of fast food and strip mall shopping leading up to the pearly gates of Victorian architecture.  30 minutes into entering Durham, I finally found East Campus, the area I am staying for the next three weeks.    West Campus looks like gothic classrooms meet danish homestyles...very regal and professional.  There is even an area WC that is called Krzyzeskiville.  It all demands academic, athletic, and even social excellence.    East Campus could quite well be where  urlLink Animal House  was filmed.  It's quad is reminiscent to  urlLink SMU's  main drag, where all buildings lead up to the admissions hall...except everything looks as crisp at SMU...the West Campus looks magnificent here, and East Campus looks like frat land.  It didn't help that Duke's TIP short course moved in today, so 500 7th through 10th graders were out in the quad, and RAs much younger than me were wearing hats backwards and talking jive...it also probably didn't help that I just came from an incredibly well-run camp and saw an out-of-control party as my first Duke TIP experience.    However, there are many staff members not connected to the Leadership Institute here, so ethical questions about mingling and other sundries no longer exist.    My room has no air conditioning.  It reminds me of my room off Pomerado Court in San Diego.  We had air conditioning, but the days were so nice that we'd just leave the windows open and let the breeze in.  This is a little hotter than that, but I took a nap when I showed up and remembered how nice a breezy nap could be.  When Justin Kirkes lived with me, he would crank up the AC so he could get all of his covers on him.  I like sleeping in a hotter room so I can just let my skin feel the breeze.  Thus, I am an optomist about no AC in the middle of the summer in the South.  And I'm living on the 3rd floor.    A few people are around and about...I don't know if they're Leadership folks, and they already know each other, so to go up and ask is daunting.  And I also don't really care at the moment.  It's nice to make a good first impression, but it's also nice to have a day to myself, where I can go to Barnes  Noble and do some reading and hang out by myself without feeling obligated to socialize with others.  Socialization commences tomorrow!
