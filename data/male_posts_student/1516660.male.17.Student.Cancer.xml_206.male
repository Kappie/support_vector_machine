I went to a Charmed site, and they got this signs to tell you that you are an obsessive fan. I will post my 'obsessive fan' habits. Okayy...here goes.   You are watching too much Charmed when:  -->When you walk up to an automatic door at the grocery store,you wave your hand like Prue used to do and pretend you used Telekinesis to open it. (I do that to the lifts often! HaHa!)  -->You hold out your hand and call for things that are across the room (I always like to do that!)  -->If you get angry at someone, you wave your hands about, trying to blow them up (Ha!)  -->Whenever a charmed ad comes on tv or radio, you yell at the whole room to shush and listen intently to the ad. Then when its over, you get all excited about it and everyone rolls their eyes. (Yep yep yep! I even hush up my family whenever Charmed is on! I want to hear properly!!)  -->Dream about Charmed (Oh boy!)  -->You own all the Charmed books that you are aware are on sale ( have about 14 now!)  -->You obsess for hours about a certain character and wonder how cool it would be to have their power (Oh yeah! I sure do!)  Guilty as charged! Heh heh heh! Alright...gotta end this liao. See! You learnt something interesting about me today. Night blog!
