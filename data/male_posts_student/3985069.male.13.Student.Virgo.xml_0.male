I will hopefully have fun at band camp and I will hopefully lose some weight too! I can't weight until I get skinny again(if I even do)!Well I am going to play video games and then probably go to sleep so that I can get some sleep and be rested up for minni band camp tomorrow!      See Ya Later,    Mathew Thompson
