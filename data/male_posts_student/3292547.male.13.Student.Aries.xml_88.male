What it realy amounts to is I didn't want to write an entry, but I was so bored this morning I decided I would =-)  The phrase "We went to the dentist" sums it up as quick as I can. There really isn't much more to it. I still haven't gotten too far in  Lord   of   Chaos . I'm only on page 261 out of 986. So I've still got a ways to go. Anyway, I'll be seeing ya. Bye.
