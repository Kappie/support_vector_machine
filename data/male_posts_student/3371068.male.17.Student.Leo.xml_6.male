I still care for her but..... Im starting to sound like a broken record. Aw well. In happier news, Im going out with a girl I've loved since I was a kid. Melissa. She's like the ultimate complete package of goodness. She's pretty, really fucking smart, hard working, funny as hell and for some strange reason loves me back. What is it that some girls who are way out of my league see in me?
