Does anything i do matter anymore and what can any of it change?  Argh... i am lost... really really lost and confused right now, the light seems to be snuffed out, there seems to be an overcast shadow. What can i say? A feeling of hopelessness, a feeling of depression has now crept in to fill whatever i have felt. yet, somehow, at the bottom of it all, i have joy and happiness... Confused? yeah will, tell me about it.  So much, has happened, all the way from the time Kelly told me, 'just forget about me' in June, to now. So much, just so much... so tired, and just so confused... With mix feelings and new thoughts, i really need some quiet time to think and reflect.  To Kelly, i guess, what i really wanted to say is all in that E-mail that i just sent to you today. Why? Why didn't you just be honest with me? I didn't know, i really didn't know. Argh... i really didn't need you to be so shy with so many 9it doesn't really matter' when it mattered so much to me and you, but why didn't you just tell me the truth? It might have made it so much easier for everyone. I am NOT blaming you, just that, i wish that you could have been more honest with me, you could have trust me.  To Cherie, i guess, i can't hide my feelings for you and this forever, so yeah. Anyway, i don't know what to say, except during this shot period of time, you have come to mean alot to me and that you made me special, made me happy and have been there when i needed someone the most.  Well, to all of this? i really don't know anymore, both mean so much to me and i can't deny feelings for either of them, especially to Kelly i guess. I just don't know, feeling so lost, yet in my heart i know that Kelly doesn't really want to care anymore. But damn it, why does it all have to be so complicated, so intricate?! Argh, i just want to die now, or just shut myself up as i consider and ponder over everything. Yet, in my heart, even though i know that both of them matter alot to me right now, i guess, i don't know who is it that i would really choose. I am so very sorry to both of them.  Both are so special to me in their own ways, yet, Kelly, i don't know, i just wish you told me much earlier and at least, made me clear as to what was going on before i jumped to my conclusions. Cherie, i just don't know what can i say right now, but, i can simply tell you that, you mean a lot to me too, perhaps more than i realise but i really can't say much as to what i feel now cause i need to think. I just hope that everything would be cleared up, waiting for a final answer to everything from Kelly. Kelly, i hope that this entry or any previous entires wouldn't cloud your thoughts or affect you, cause, right now, all i really need from you is to be honest with me.  Friends and family, please forgive me, give me strength and let me know what you think privately.  Lord, i ask for strength and the clearity of mind, please open my eyes and let me choose and be able to make the correct decision according to your will. All i need now Lord, is Your guidiance, Your strength and the wisdom that You can beseech me. I pray that everything would be sorted out in the end and that it wouldn't dramactically affect the relations that i shared with anyone. Amen.
