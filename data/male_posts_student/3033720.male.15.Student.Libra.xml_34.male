Today's topic is Andrews dick versus mine. (pretend there is a bongo player in the background....Daniel Ponder)  "Triple A meets car battery; You see the triple A, you cant help but gasp; The car battery chills you to the bones; Is there hair to be found on the triple A?; None that I can gaze upon; Is there hair to be found on the car battery?; Why don't you look and see; But despite the size; Everyone loves Andy's sausage; Regardless of the notion that it's unpurbertized; Oh, one can't help but take a mighty laugh when thee sees its size!; My weiner dwarfs Andrew's; I bet he isn't even circumsized; Don't even ask me, I'm a jew; I don't think I had a briss; Though it's something I'm sad I missed; Glory be unto Josh, the puller of the pants!; You showed the world Andrew's dick; And my! what a small stick; The triple A and the car battery; Which will you rely on when you need power?; Think about it, I'll give you....ahhh....an hour....."    Well that was gay. Oh well, when Aleisa commands I must obay. Instead of sending me hate mail just ask me politely to take it off and I will. Next week I will continue Dustin's poetry corner, so until then, farewell.
