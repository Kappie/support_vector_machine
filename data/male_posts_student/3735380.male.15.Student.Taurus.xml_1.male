The morning—err, you know what I mean—was a drag.  Then my mom practically forced me to sit in the sun for 10 minutes. I guess I should have told her about photons (my second last blog). Anyway, I got a very light tan, hardly noticable., nothing big.  The rest of the afternoon was a drag.  Next thing we did, my brother's 8-year-old friends were going to see the movie "Dodgeball". Like that would teach them any life lessons. Note my sarcasm.  Anyway, after a phone call, I gave in. My mom threatened it was either Dodgeball or Two Brothers. I completely gave in and said Dodgeball. They won't follow the movie anyway. All they enjoy is throwing popcorn in people's hair.  Throwing popcorn? I meant flicking popcorn, and I was the main target, until I sat behind them. Great movie. Three stars, and that's actually good, because I've only twice given a four star rating. Pirates of the Carribean and Spiderman I.  Anyway, we went to my brother's friends house. They played dodgeball. Typical after a movie like that. I chased the dog when she jumped out of the car. At least I got some exercise.  After all that, I finally came home and wrote this blog. My parents are still trying to make me read my summer books. I say not until July. But they always find a way.
