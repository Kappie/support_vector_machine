They claim that the reason their record sales are plummeting is because of people who share files. This is complete and utter bullshit. People are not buying records because they don't want to waste their 20 bucks on a piece of crap over-produced, spiritless piece of crap album. If these assholes want to sue somebody, let them sue themselves for being money-hungry crapheads. Yes I said crapheads. If they want better record sales, they should lower the price of thier records to 10 bucks, at least. They say "file sharers are cheating artists" and that they are "looking out for them." What a complete crock of shit. If by paying artists 2% of record sales is "looking out for them" then they are artists' guardian angels. But this is not about the artists, this is about our rights. If I want to download a over-produced played out song from Kazaa, I should have the right to. But why are they against it. This is why: read carefully!!          remember the age of tapes. That was the stone age right. But weren't people "recording" music then. Yes. Everyone I knew, were recording from the radio onto their tapes. Did the RIAA complain? hell no! Why? because each tape purchase gave them money. In other words, each time I buy a tape, the record industry gets a certain percentage of the money. They were happy, indeed. Now that, mp3's are unprofitable for them, they are pissed off. It's not about artists' "rights" it's about money, filthy money. Money over music!! And these morons have the audacity to sue little girls who download britney spears songs. (those girls should be sued for listening to britney spears period) Point is, if you buttholes continue to make crappy music, we won't buy it, and we will always share, thats what we were taught since birth.           let me recommend some good file-sharing programs:       winmx:  urlLink http://www.winmx.com
