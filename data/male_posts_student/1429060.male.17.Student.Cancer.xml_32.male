As you may have read in comments before, Rachel has visited my site (how in the world she got the URl, I have no idea), and, consequently, I have been to her site, and, thus, I am now a member of that community. There really is no other reason. Just trying to distribute crazed ideas like a plasmodial slime mold.  Love that imagery , don't you?  Just returned from a talk about witchcraft at the Universitry of Memphis. Rather interesting, I daresay. There was a short professor who was brilliantly funny, and everyone loved listening to him speak about witchcraft and wizardry in Europe between 1450-1750 (C.E.) because he made it so humorous. Let's go drink some hallucinogen potion. Right now. Get your vacuum cleaners, becuase brooms are so out of date these days.  I died in English today. Speaking about...what was it?...Cystic Fibrosis, I think. Yep, that essay utterly destroyed my body, mind, and soul.  We have a new DOY member! Bethany Chang from Nashville, a fellow of mine from the days of Mr. Stress-Syndrom Jackson, joins us with her writings and poetry. See her now, fools!  urlLink DOY .  Cheers, mortals.
