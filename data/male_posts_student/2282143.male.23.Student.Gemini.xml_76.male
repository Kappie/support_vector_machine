Somehow, the people in my class think I am smart so now I have to teach them all about DNA and how it works.  I mean, really, I dont know how to explain it... All I know is that this is the billionth time Ive been taught it and its just second nature to me.  So I guess Im just gonna be answering questions and pointing to the book and all that stuff.  Shit, I should probably do   my   studying first.  So thats what Im gonna do tonight besides my normal routine of TKD.  Im gonna blow them away with an extremely difficult (for them) DNA translation problem where they have to realize its backwards, then do the RNA, then look for the start codon, etc etc.  All stuff that I would have no problem doing, but apparently these people would have trouble.  And they arent kids out of high school either, so I dont feel bad.  If they get that, then they are pretty set for the test.  The big thing Im wondering is if I should make them pay me.  The whole thing was brought up because some lady wanted to pay me 20 bucks an hour to tutor her for the test (she's kinda failing and cant blow the last 2 tests to pass the class).  Speaking of which, according to Kim (one o' my partners) she called me "that surfer boy"  Am I really that surfer?  WHAT?!?!?!  So yeah, next thing I know, her entire group and a few others are like "thats a great idea!"  So do I have them pay me?  How much?  how do you judge these things?  HOW AM I GOING TO HELP THESE PEOPLE!?!?!?!  Yargh.  Who knows.  I dont.  And I should.  So thats why Im gonna study tonight.    Anyways, it was a busy morning.  Gave the Porkchop (Wally) a bath with Piper and painted my ceiling with a wicked sweet paint that goes on pink and dries white so you dont miss any spots.    Also the weekend was good.  Birthday was good.  Saw Shrek 2.  Hilarious.  You must see.  Its way more adult than the first one, or at least they dont hide it like they did.  My buddy Joges' (Melissa) wedding was fun.  Very different, but fun.  Punch and cake in the basement of the church after the ceremony.  Music, but no dancing allowed.  Besides, a bump and grind would have been most unholy.  Founders Day was cool too.  Lots of drinking.  Multiple gin and tonics and such.  That night was lots of fun too.  Hung out with Beth and Tom like the olden days and spent the rest of the night just talking with Sam.  Woke up, had to recover, did some stuff, went to get sushi with Lark over at the Sushi House in LaGrange.  Killer.  Was awesome stuff.  Must go there more often if not so damn expensive.  Lark told me all about driving through a tornado, canoeing through the grasslands (thats how flooded it was) and about the juggler she likes.  Crazy.  Well, I should get to my studying.  Fun times..  fun times...
