So as I'm walking down the path, I see this dog in a backyard. Although it didn't look quite right, it was about knee to waist high and was black with dark grey splotches. It also looked like it was half wolf. So me liking wolves, I walk up to it and let it smell my hand (of course I was hesitant at first) and it was okay. Then my friend tried to go closer but the dog looked up at him and growled as he approached. Then somehow the dog got out of the backyard and next I know, I'm on the ground getting licked on the face by this dog. This part is a little hazy, but I think I was able to talk to the dog too, but I'm not sure. Then my friend said we had to go to the train station (yea, that's a little messed up). I didn't want to leave the dog but I did, so we went to the train station, but I couldn't bear to be away from this dog, so I went back. So when I came back, I saw the dog and then woke up.
