Good riddance I most definitely say. When the bloody thing actually came out and the concrete shaver had done its job, my tentative tongue checked the damage and possible remains. I must say that the thing did its job ok. It's got more of a "semi-circular" feel to it than ever before and eating the ultimate orgasmic cookies from the canteen was a taste, sight, well just general experience to behold for the ages (in my view at least).On bad side I can see thus far is that I'm going to have to start brushing regularly again, but that's not worries for what I've got back - a fully natural, non-war infested set of teeth, WOOOO!!!  So nehoo, I was in quite a lot of boredom last night, and as the Net seemed to be less than the time filling source that it usually is, I sat down and watched a program about ANGRY PISSED OF CHEF Gordon Ramsey, and watch him try to turn a young, awful, obnoxious chef from Yorkshire into something that can produce half edible food, and the program made for pretty good viewing to be honest, helped somewhat by my liking all things where the central character gets his finger yanked out of his own arse.  The Universities also came out to play yesterday at college and just for the hell of it, I managed to pick up certain prospectus' on Oxford, Cambridge and Thames Valley et al. The day, although on the very long side, came out to be very useful and some things  were really interesting, like the gap year presentation, and most things there made me open my eyes to the advantages of them in the long term. xBuBzx
