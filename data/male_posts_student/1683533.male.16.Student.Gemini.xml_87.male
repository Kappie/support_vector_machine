Sorry, I haven't posted in awhile...Just haven't felt like it, but let me update you on everything that has happened.  Just For You broke up :(.  But me and Marty are starting a side project called A Burning Reason (see links).  We really need a drummer though...  On Saturday I went to The Suicide Machines annual X-mas show...it was no doubt the best concert I have been to.  First, Half the Battle and Fordirelifesake played.  They were both amazing.  Everybody was hardcore dancing in the pit though...I don't like hardcore dancing too much...Then a band called the Rivercity Rebels played.  Imagine the Clash with a trombone and tenor saxophone.  Despite what some other people said, I really liked them.  Then, the highlight of the evening...THE SUICIDE MACHINES... they are better than I imagined live.  I crowd surfed 4 times (dropped once lol :P )...I can't remember to which songs, but I think Break the Glass was one of them.  Before I surfed, I was up front, and Marty and I yelled into the microphone and stuff when Jason Navarro leaned over the crowd.  The pit was very fun and friendly, lots of skanking, lots of love...  Here was the highlight of that evening...afterwards I discovered a couple of unguarded doors leading somewhere from the side of Clutch Cargos, me and marty went in, and found ourselves in the backstage area...we talked to the bass player from Fordirelifesake, and then I saw my cousin Kevin back there who already had a backstage pass because he has known the Suicide Machines for like 6 years.  He lead me to all the members of the Suicide Machines and I got all their autographs!! :)...(the ticket stub with the autographs are already framed lol)  I got a lot of cool shit for X-mas:  -Tony Hawk's Underground for PS2  -XIII for PS2  -The Greatest Story Ever Told by the Lawrence Arms  -Washed up and Through the Ringer by Catch 22  -Dinosaur Sounds by Catch 22  -Kill The Musicians by Screeching Weasel  -Nokia Cell Phone (734-968-2200) :-P  -SOCKS!!! YES!!!  -A calvin and Hobbes book  -An Onion book  -sour patch kids  -batteries  -pencils lol  -A cool circle like chair (space style thing, i cant describe it...)  Then there was today when Kate came over at 12 :)  We hung out till 8:00.  I love that girl like...like...alot...I couldn't think of anything sweet...sorry....so now I am just sitting here reflecting on the good time I had :)  Tomorrow Marty is gonna spike Alana's hair I think...I told him to tell me when so I can come watch...and maybe take pictures :P...That would be insanely tight if she went through with it...  Well...I am having a very good vacation at this point...let the good times roll! bye bye :)  "Hey suburbia, hey surbia, hey suburbia, we're in love with you..." -Screeching Weasel
