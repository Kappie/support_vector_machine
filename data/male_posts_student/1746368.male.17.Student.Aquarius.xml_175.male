My mom and my aunt (known as Leslie from here on out)and Dominique (if you guys don't know who Dominique is; she is my girlfriend of nearly 2 years...I think that it was pretty much implied that she and I are dating) all went to the park where the barbeque was taking place and set up all of the decorations and the like.   I stayed home and watched Chris for a little while. I started watching another one of Kent Hovinds seminars (I'm almost done; I only have about one more to go) Then they came back and picked me up and we went over to the park to celebrate!  It was cool, I saw a few of my aunts and uncles that I hadn't seen for a while and I met some that I had never seen. People kept on commenting on how tall I was. I kept thinking "Who are you?" But never really said that. The only distant relative I remember is my Uncle Dick. He used to tickle me when I was younger, except I've only seen him two other times besides today. It was pretty cool. My whole family is in love with Dominique now. I wish I was.  I just realized I didn't put a quote for the last post. I will do that in a second.
