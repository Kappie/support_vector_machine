I'm gonna be posting a hell lot of crap on here today, because somehow my Steam isin't working. Those of you who know what Steam is can now feel my pain and sorrow.      No, I'm not gothic.      So I guess I'ma look for more funny pictures and save them on my computer for future reference.      P's.
