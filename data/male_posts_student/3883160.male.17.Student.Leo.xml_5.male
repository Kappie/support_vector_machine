Unfortunately, they both air on Tuesdays at the same time.  Today, my sister is taking me to Winona to get a new VCR.  Then I can tape Last Comic Standing while Big Brother's on.   Big Brother 5 :   On the premiere eppy of BB5, Jase won HoH ("Head of Household").  Jase bugs me because he and Scott believe that they're in control of everything in the Big Brother house.  Maybe that's true, but I believe someone in the house is going to win HoH and put both of them up for eviction at the same time, assuring that one of them will be evicted.  On yesterday'ss episode, Jase decided to put Mike and Jennifer (aka Nicomus) up for eviction.  I hope that Mike goes home because Nicomus rocks.  By the way, Nicomus is the half-sister of Michael.  So, I hope Michael prevents Nicomus from getting the boot.   Last Comic Standing :   vs.   Last Tuesday, Ant (left) lost the head to head match to Gary Gulman.  I'm glad of that because Ant seemed manipulative.  To tell the truth, I was shocked because I thought Ant was funnier than Gary.  However, the audience said differently.  Next Tuesday, the comics have to perform their act in front of one tough crowd... kids!  This might be tough for some comics, but I hope Tammy does fine.  Tammy is my favorite comic because she won against Todd Glass in the head-to-head match, effectively sending him home!  So, those are the two main shows I'm watching.  See ya.
