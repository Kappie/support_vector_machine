What a waste of time...well...I do get paid...so...what a brilliant idea!  Then we had a barbecue for the staff afterward, which wasn't that bad, except for the fact that some other, not going to mention any names, were talking about drinking games during dinner.  Nothing makes me more awkward than people who drink talking about it.       At least I will get paid a little bit for this week.  My boss at Brooks is really starting to piss me off now.  She posted the damn schedule early again, apparently because she's going on vacation, but my reasoning tells me it was just to piss me off even more.  And boy did Jen, one of my other managers, get mad.  It was like she expected me to know that Linda, the manager I hate, was going on vacation...EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN'T WORKED FOR THREE WEEKS!...Sorry about that, I just had to get that out.  Wow, I really hate my job.       I saw the show "Straight Plan for the Gay Man" today adnn only two words come to mind...Absolutely Hilarious.  Just think Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, but Comedy Central style.  I highly recommend that show to everyone who likes to laugh...and if you don't like to laugh...go to hell...or somehing...       So...the carnival last night was fun.  I'm pretty proud of myself for going on the Satellite for the first time.  It wasn't bad at all.  Actually it was quite enjoyable, except for the fact that an extremely sharp piece of machinery was wiggling around right above us.  That didn't make me feel very safe...not at all.  That and the fact that they closed the Hurricane just after I had been on it due to technical problems...stupid carnies.       That about raps it up for tonight...so go away!  Out
