Oooh, look at me, I can walk around making jokes that sometimes even canned laughter doesn't respond to.  I can make sexual comments that make no sense whatsoever in the conversation just because it might be funny, but it's not.  Oooh, look at me, I can be outrageously stupid so that America will fall in love with me.  I mean, really.  Come on, America.  Okay, so I don't really hate  Friends that  much, but at times I wonder where our great country's headed when people follow a show like that around religiously...or more like "cultishly."  No, I'm not saying that people who watch that show are stupid.  I'm sure they're great American blue bloods.  However, their taste in television leaves something to be desired.  Case in point: one of my best friends is a Friends fanatic.  Every morning in BCIS she tells me about how devastated she is that Friends is ending (because of course, I, self-proclaimed  Friends  hater among my peers, simply have to fall in love with those nitwits).  She's an extremely intelligent young woman, but when it comes to TV, she's simply out of her league.  I mean, really.  Come on, people.  Why am I ranting like this?  Why have I launched a near jihad against Friends and its soon-to-come spinoff Joey?  Because...it's fun :-)  Besides that, I'm going to watch the show tonight.  And before you go getting your long johns in a wad, it's not from positive motivation.  No, no, no, my friends, that would be all too sweet a victory for those Friends-lovers.  I'm watching the collection of what NBC executives and Friends producers consider to be the best all-time Friends moments.  This will be the moment of truth.  Will the show past my litmus test?  Will it convert me into the cult of fanaticisity?  Ha!  Wouldn't you just love to see that?
