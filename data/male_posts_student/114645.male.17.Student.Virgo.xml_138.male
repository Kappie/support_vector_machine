I guess this is my mood and feeling at the moment I guess. I dunno though.  Today was long and boring. In French we did a play about going to Ireland and the Guinness factory. Ann Marie is a little alcoholic. Lol. Then in Aviation, we took a quiz on section B. It was easy, since Mr. Kelly gave us all the answers. Anywho. I guess that is all.   OH! Funny story. Carmen Lee came over to me, and asked: "Do you like Matt Malsteade?" and I said no, but I use to and then she said "Are you gay?!?!?" and I said "Yeah, you are like 9 months behind." Peter then said "You are?" lol. Then she asked who I liked, and I didn't tell her, and Sean is grateful I didn't tell her, or it would be around school that Sean was gay, and he doesn't want that. I do though!    Updated: January 30, 2004 @ 5:50 AM.
