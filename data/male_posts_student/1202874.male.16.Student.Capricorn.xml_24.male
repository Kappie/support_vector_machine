(that whole hey its summer seems to be the saying for the season and i am not one to argue.) man the past couple days have been rough to say the least. for starters liz is outta town and she's the one i talk to when i'm lonely, etc. so thats been a bummer. then i can't find my wallet. great... i didn't even have my money in it but i would definitely exchange a shitload of money for what was in there. my temps. fabulous work doug. just superb. now at least i'll have another month to wait after i busted my ass to get them the first day possible. still in search though, by wednesday the plan is to get the replacement. friggin yay. notice the lack of an explanation point. also not that i said "at the least i'll have another month" cause dearest mommy decides she's gotta start to lay down the law and that i'm gonna have to wait til i'm 18 to get my license. what kinda bull shit is that. this is when you decide to start teaching me discipline and responsiblity? its a little late and a little bit harsh for whatever the hell you're trying to do. i'm gonna be learning to drive when i'm leaving for college. a bijillion points deducted from the mother unit. maybe if i lost one of your precious vases or whatever moms collect i'd understand that you need to bring down the punishment but this is my own stuff and you can stay the hell outta it. not a chance that ur gonna be driving my ass to graduation. not a hope of a chance... we'll keep you updated on what goes down there. if there's a post on this thing 3 years from now saying, "i finally got my license." i'm definitely gonna be one pissed kid... now that thats done with let's look at the good side of life. which despite all of the above there is a lot of good things going down. liz came back tonight from columbus and i'm probably gonna be going to see her tomorrow. there's other people in bedford that need a stop by and say hi. so my buddy is back and thats very good. secondly, today i figured out that i won't have to pay for insurance if my mom really is serious. fuck work then for another 3 years. gotta look at the pro's and cons here people... lastly as i am shockingly losing energy, sam and me talked today and i realized how much i missed seeing her. it seems to be the start of something good, friendship or what not. she's a very sweet girl and we've both had our problems in the past. but the past is just that, the past. i'm excited about whats in store.   oh my, what was that...... i think you people call it a yawn. i would cheer for it but i'm afraid i'll wake myself up again.
