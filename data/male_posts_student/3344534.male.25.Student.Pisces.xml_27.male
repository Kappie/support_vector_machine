Know goal? The NHL apparently doesn't  By BUCKY GLEASON   6/6/2004      C ALGARY - Hey, Calgary, we in Buffalo feel your pain. We, too, are familiar with phantom goals, or in your case, one that should have counted but never did and wasn't adequately reviewed. Now, it's off to Game Seven with the league getting saddled with yet another controversy in the Stanley Cup finals.  We need not rehash Brett Hull's foot in the crease in the 1999 finals that handed the Stanley Cup to the Dallas Stars. At least that one was open to debate, a judgment call that didn't go the Sabres' way. And of course there was the six-hole in Philly in 2000.   This one could turn out to be a bigger mess because Oleg Saprykin should have been awarded a goal that would have handed the Stanley Cup to the Calgary Flames, rather than forcing them and the Tampa Bay Lightning to travel across the continent and settle things Monday.   History will claim Martin St. Louis' goal 33 seconds into the second overtime gave the Lightning a 3-2 victory in Game Six on Saturday night in the Pengrowth Saddledome, forcing a seventh game in the St. Pete Times Forum on Monday. Calgary should have won the game much sooner, setting up the biggest celebration since the Flames won the Cup in 1989.   ABC replays showed Saprykin scored with just less than seven minutes remaining in regulation after charging past two defensemen and sending a shot into the crease. Nikolai Khabibulin tried kicking it away, but the puck squirted under him and crossed the goal line. Of course, it wasn't reviewed. The Flames became another victim in a league known for making serial mistakes at the worst times.   And they wonder why people say this league is a joke.   Fans were chanting, "We want the Cup!" in both overtimes.   Folks, you should have had the Cup. How would you like to be Rhett Warrener, the former Sabres defenseman who was twice a victim. He said going into the series that No Goal was still wrenching his stomach. Now he gets more acid.   The good news was Calgary has another chance, even thought it shouldn't need one. There are few things better in sports than Game Seven, especially in hockey. You think these two teams have been going at each other now? Wait until Monday night. And make sure you're rested. Overtime is expected, if not encouraged.   The Lightning were lucky. They thought they had things under control when Brad Richards scored on the power play from behind the goal line. Everybody knows what happens when Richards scores. The Lightning wins. They're 30-0-2 this season, 8-0 in the playoffs, when he finds the back of the net. And he did it twice.   Apparently, the Lightning win when Saprykin scores, too.   The Lightning's confidence skyrocketed through the saddle-shaped roof when Richards again on the PP later in the period. Certainly, given the previous statistics, the series was certainly headed back to Tampa with the winner hoisting the Cup, no? Well, it doesn't happen quite so easily against the Flames.   They never, and I mean never, give up.   The Flames have been down several times throughout the series, and they were trailing twice Saturday night, but they tied the game both times to set up a nail-biting, heart-pumping third period and 20 minutes, 33 seconds of overtime.   Chris Clark popped one in from the doorstep after Ville Nieminen's blind, spinning feed bounced off Stephane Yelle's stick and landed on Clark's. Marcus Nilson's was even easier after Saprykin weaved through two defenseman and handed Nilson a gimme.   Monday will be a fitting, if not necessary, ending.   It has been a fantastic series, and Game Six was better than Game Five, which was better than Game Four. The hockey gods figured the league will be shutting down next season, so why not extend this one? It's seems the only way to decide a series in which two teams couldn't be better matched if the league called Dial-A-Date.   The best-of-seven series for Lord Stanley's trophy was billed as a battle between Tampa Bay's speed and skill and Calgary's rough and tumble, pretty against punishing. What we've learned over the six games is that the Lightning's toughness was underrated, and so was the Flames' talent. Together, they treated fans to the best series in years.   Now it comes down to one game.   Yes, we get more.   The finals aren't usually a test of hockey so much as a test of survival. Look down the list of Cup winners over the years, and you'll see one team overpowering another, a string of four straight sweeps in the '90s, a necklace of anticlimactic finishes. This year, we watched two teams push each other to exhaustion and beg for more.   The series already had everything. Great goals. Big hits. Breakaways. Cheap shots. Overtime. A suspension. It had a fight between two of the game's best players in Jarome Iginla and Vincent Lecavalier. It had a match of wits between two porky coaches, Calgary's Darryl Sutter and Tortorella. It had short-handed goals and incredible defense, odd-man rushes and unbelievable goaltending.   Iginla and Martin St. Louis, two finalists for the Hart Trophy given to the most valuable player in the regular season, went head-to-head with the same level of play. Iginla positioned himself for the Conn Smythe Trophy by dominating in Calgary's first three victories. St. Louis countered with a goal in Game One, scored a big goal in a victory in Game Two and tied Game Five with another.   The Flames and Bolts crammed more into six games than some teams do into 60. Now it's 82 games and four rounds of the playoffs crammed into one.   And another major blunder threatening to corrupt the finals.
