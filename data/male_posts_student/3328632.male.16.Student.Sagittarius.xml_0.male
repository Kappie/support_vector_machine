IIX (or VIII as it seems to be referred to alot, dont ask me why) was the most emo one I've played, but i kinda like that stuff ya know?  But anyway, FFX had one of those beautiful bittersweet endings, complete with matching  urlLink music .  But the best thing about X was the http://squaresoft.com/uematsu/, it's way more direct, and way cool.  It's on to X-2 for me now, yuna has a  urlLink gun , something to look forward too.  However, my favorite character was Rikku, she had a happy-go-lucky spirit, and she was the theif of the group.  She was just all around loveable.
