However, if there's repetition of common themes, does it mean anything?   Also I shouldn't have NPR as my alarm, because my sense of reality in the mornings isn't always there.  I don't want to get all Freudian, so I just stop there for now.  Now playing - The Descendents - "Talking"  My place is a mess. I want to clean it up before I leave on Friday for D.C.  I should go have breakfast and get shit done before the meeting at noon.  ***
