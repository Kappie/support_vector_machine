This Leap Day, Friday the 29th of February, I made certain to catch the Mountain Goats in concert at Bloomington's own Waldron Arts Center for the measly sum of seven dollars American.  Naturally, this show would begin as every other show ever has - no less than an hour and twenty minutes late.  To begin with, the Waldron auditorium is an unusual space, and not really a good one for putting on shows.  The inside of the Arts Center is really nice.  It is so nice that every single one of my fellow indie-rock snobs was reduced to utter silence both inside the auditorium and in the narrow, constrictive lobby.  Fuck, there's a parquet floor.  I think we've all been to shows like this, and can picture them in our heads.  I'll help you out:  Low.  Rachel's.  Ida.  The Red House Painters.  Bright Eyes.  Edith Frost.  Some good, some bad, some fucking lousy, all of them a surefire bet for a no-talking night out.  Now you've got the idea.  Due to the start-time sleight-of-hand (Flyer says show at seven, show up early for tickets.  Man at desk says show at eight, plenty of tickets.) I arrive and walk in at about eight-fifteen, right in the middle of the second band's sound check, like about thirty other people.  The band playing was called Manishevitz, and they are from Chicago.  They were playing Bloomington, because they are on Jagjaguwar records, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Secretly Canadian Corp. (motto:  "Putting Bloomington the fuck to sleep since, oh, 1999 or so.").  Before Jagjaguwar came to Bloomington, they put out records by Oneida.  Now, this.  Manishevitz sound exactly like Chamberlain.  (The existence of Chamberlain, AKA Split Lip, is a conundrum.  Back issues of Skyscraper and Punk Planet are littered with ads for Split Lip/Chamberlain albums.  Some people will insist that this stuff is emo, but  sonically they suggest a jam session of the ten smuggest artists on the Northern Exposure soundtrack deciding to "rock out a little".  If you ask anyone with direct experience of Chamberlain, they will immediately agree that they suck.)  Now, with the time stretching before me, and the opening band now not scheduled until nine, I decided to wander out into the warm February air and go get some coffee, in the process losing my seat.  I returned, with the coffee, fairly early on in the actual opener's set.  Elephant Micah is a one-piece from just north of Louisville.  Like a true Indianan, Elephant Micah manages to be so bland, soft, and unassuming as to be offensive.  A kid I talked to outside said that he had gone to grade school with Elephant Micah, and a preponderance of his songs are about a girl he broke up with in junior high.  This is not surprising.  Next up:  Manishevitz.  My earlier exposure to these ungodly Chamberlain-alikes was enough.  I hung around outside and got pretty good at the Connect Four game on my cellphone.   I went across the street to a cafe that was also a video store and got some more coffee.  More time brought more semi-contact with more semi-acquaintances, one of whom told me that I didn't seem like the sort of person who would be at a Mountain Goats show.  I don't know what that means, exactly.  I have a few Mountain Goats albums, and I enjoy listening to them.  That's pretty much the standard, isn't it?  After Manishevitz finally fucked off I went up and grabbed myself a seat for the Mountain Goats show.  It wasn't too hard because the collected hipster morass had decided to sit on the floor.  The Mountain Goats appeared (with supplementary bassist) wearing a possibly ironic "SOBER" sweatshirt and sat down with a minimum of banter, during which it transpired that, as he was born in Bloomington before moving with his family to California at age nine months, he had decided for this admittedly nonsensical reason to play songs he hadn't been playing this tour.  What this amounted to was a mix of old stuff and stuff off of  We Shall All Be Healed , all of it pretty well-played but sort of marred by the acoustics.   Otherwise, the Mountain Goats' songs benefitted greatly from the live setting.  This judgment may be conditioned by the fact that the Mountain Goats albums that I possess,  Protein Source of the Future. . .Now! ,  Ghana , and  Bitter Melon Farm , are compilations of seven-inches, rarities, and compilation contributions and therefore more lo-fi than the typical offering.    Naturally this wouldn't be a proper TINAFTS post unless it contained the guaranteed minimum of Bloomington-bashing, and tonight provided no shortage.  In particular I am thinking of an exchange between one of the concert-goers and an innocent passerby.  The Manishevitz set had pushed a number of people outside by its sheer mass of Chamberlain-derived suckitude and I was among them.  I was engaged in idle chatter with a group of people, one of which I had recognized from the Black Eyes show I attended in Louisville some time ago ( urlLink q.v. ).  At some point a chirpy young woman in a sport utility vehicle pulls up and asks what kind of music the Mountain Goats were.  "Oh, it's sort of contemporary Christian," comes the answer.  That is uncool.  It's one thing to let the sheer low fidelity and uncoolness of the Mountain Goats drive away the uninitiated.  It is quite another to trick people who may on some off chance enjoy the music into probably going and renting  Jerry Maguire  for the seventeenth time.  I mean, who's to say?  I suspect that this practice of giving phony information to innocent bystanders one deems insufficiently hip is epidemic amongst Louisvillians and has been for the past five years;  it is also the reason that I hate  urlLink the Metroschifter , not as a band but as people.
