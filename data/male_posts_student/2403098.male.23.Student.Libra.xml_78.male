After parking my car I took a short-cut to the library through Adams Hall, the Business Administration building in which I have had the majority of all of my classes in college.  I walked out of Adams hall, on my way to the Great Reading Room of the library, and as I walked through the garden's of OU's beautiful campus and the cool night breeze chilled my feet, barely covered with my 4 year old JCrew flip-flops, I noticed how empty campus felt.  I reminded myself that tomorrow was the last day of final exams and that it was likely that most people had already finished up and were off campus until next fall.. and then it hit me:  I will take my final exam tomorrow and I will be off campus for the rest of my life.  I stopped dead in my tracks, in the middle of a flower garden and stared up at the gigantic and gothic looking Library that loomed over my head.  I was completely alone, and for a moment in time I could do nothing but sit down on a bench and reminisce.  I tried to remember each and every class I have taken, each building I have had a class in, and each semester's general and most poignant memories.  Each memory was yesterday and a million years ago all at the same time.  I was paralyzed for a good twenty minutes, just sitting and thinking, all the while staring at the 100-something year old building in front of me, with its collegiate appearance.    I attempted to study for about an hour, but my mind wandered a great deal.  Every 5 minutes or so, I would recall a class I had taken, or a person I will miss, a moment I had forgotten in time over the past four years.  I gathered my things, and left the Reading Room, headed back to my car.  I wanted to traverse through the hallways of Adams Hall one more time.  The computer labs were closed, every classroom was locked, and to my knowledge I was the only living soul in the building.  I strolled slowly down the long main hallway, taking note of the emptiness that the midnight hour left for Adams to enjoy.  As of tomorrow, I will be done with you, Adams Hall, for all intents and purposes.  I have wanted to get you out of my life for a while now, but why was letting the door close behind me so fucking hard tonight?  The empty study tables, laden with scrap paper and left-behind study materials, seemed so lonely with no one filling their heavy wooden chairs.  How many times had I met at "the tables" for a group project meeting?  I could hear my own breathing patterns as I headed for the door, footsteps on the hard floor echoing off the stone walls of a building that seemed to scream academia.  I couldn't help but turn around and watch it close as I left Adams Hall for one of the last times, half wanting to run back inside, metaphorically and physically.  I did turn around (again), once I reached the bottom of the stone steps.  I looked up at the building to see the words "BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION" carved in stone above a doorway that I have passed through on nearly a daily basis for I don't know how long.  The same words will be written on a piece of paper soon with the words "bachelor of" typed in front of them, and I almost can't believe it's just hitting me that it's over.    As if my life was passing before my eyes just before death, my experiences passed before my mind's eye (sorry lauren I had to use that phrase) as I walked to my car.  My life at the University of Oklahoma is ending, and my first instinct was to cling to the cornerstones of each building on campus, and plead with them to embrace me for a short while longer.  Please let me stay in the comfort of a protected and fun world.  Please keep me with my peers forever, don't let the people I see everyday disappear from my life after tomorrow, it's too soon.  If I close my eyes.. when I open them will I be headed back to one of my favorite classes, with some of my favorite people on campus?   I wont be letting the door to Adams close behind me leaving me in the real world, and being done will be a dream.. right?  "I'm so ready" but at the same time, I will miss you so much.  I don't even know who "you" are in this situation.  "You" are this campus, and "you" are not having any obligations at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon.  "You" are a life where friendly faces can be found all over town, and life comfortable.  "You" are good times, challenging growth, uncomfortable new experiences, and a fantastic journey through the last of my youth.  "YOU" are the people that I see everyday in class, and enjoy being around, but will realistically never see again after tomorrow.  I'm glad I met "you" and I'm glad I was here.    A new generation of individuals will call this place home and make these experiences their own starting in a few short months.  No trace of me will remain, no serious donation has been made in order to name a building or classroom after me, and therefore the only record of my existence at this place and during this time resides in my mind  in some file cabinet somewhere.    I have at times thought of all the places I could have gone to school.  I think "maybe if I had gone to X school or the Univ. of X that such and such would have been different."  I wouldn't have to answer questions such as "why did you choose OKLAHOMA?!" from people back home in Texas.  I might have been at a university with a completely different environment and had a largely different college  experience.  I am so thankful I was here, and it is with complete pride and a bittersweet smile, I will depart this place.  The answer to my choice in attending the University of Oklahoma:  Because I have had an amazing time at a remarkable University filled with incredible people.  I'm so happy to have been able to call you home, OU, and I will miss you.  I could not have ever known at the onset of the people and moments I would come in contact with and the way my life would be shaped throughout my college years, but luck would have it that I ended up at the perfect place for me.    Almost 1/4 of my entire life has been lived in Oklahoma.  I'm leaving soon, and will have very little reason to come back, as I have no family here.  Rationally it could be assumed that I might never step foot in this state again after graduation.  When asked where I'm from, however, the answer will always be "San Antonio originally, but I moved here from Oklahoma."  Boomer Sooner, OU, you've been a great friend and a happy home and I thank you for both.
