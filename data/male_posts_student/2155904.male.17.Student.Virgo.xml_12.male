Boyz II Men is playing right now.  Tyke is gonna make a Christmas CD too this year...that should be fun.  Give him some good songs if you have any.  And if they are holiday related but not technically Christmas songs that is fine.  I guess it could be a Non-Denominational CD of songs that are played mostly during the month of December but spill out to both November and January.  Yeah, that is gonna be written for the title of the CD.  Yo betta bolieve it!
