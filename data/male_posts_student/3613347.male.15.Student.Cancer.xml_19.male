Since my first submission was a 3.25/10, i guess that means i failed it completely. The only for me to pass my Humanities now is to score well for my Contextual Procedural Knowledge( 3rd Submission).  WEll, the meeting is next Wednesday, and luckily it aint only me. Everybody in the school who failed must go meet him, which inculdes about 8 ppl from my class. But one thing is for certain... Everyone under my mentor in my class all failed as well.  I dun think its my fault that i failed. I followed what she told me to do, but she still failed me. What am i supposed to do? Now my MRP fail, that means my Humanities also fail. And for me to go to Sec 4, i need MSG of below 4. Then now i got at least a D7, maybe if lucky C6. What to do?    TELL ME!!! ANyone Out THeRe?
