But it's a little different this time.  Well, first, I should mention that working in Morrisville continues to suck.  I'm still not happy working there.  So I've been trying to get back in Robbinsville, now that my issue with working there is no longer there.  So I called Sam, whom I once considered to be a good pal (he used to constantly say that we were like brothers, and while I may never have reciprocated that particular feeling, I did like working with the guy and all), and he tells me that he'll call me if they need me to work there.  This offended me HORRIBLY.  I worked at that fucking store for six years.  Most people that worked there work there for three months and quit, usually without notice, if they even last three months.  I gave like seven weeks' notice that I'd be leaving, after having been the best god damned employee they ever had.  I was the best driver they had.  Nobody knew that area better than me, even after not having worked there in four months.  I was the best manager they ever had.  Every manager they had before me stole money from that place like crazy.  Just about every other person that ever ran shift in that store stole money from that place.  I never stole a dime.  Also, during the year plus that I was manager, I raised sales unlike anybody ever had before.  The previous manager, Gene, didn't give a crap about raising sales, just about working his twenty hours a week and getting out of there.  I earned every dollar of my salary, working the 55 hours a week I was supposed to for my salary.  With a crew that had maybe two good workers besides me, I made that store more profitable than it had ever been.  I didn't ask for help, I didn't need help.  I did it all basically by myself.  I sacrificed my summer so we could raise sales and do good business.    Then I ask for a job and I'm told that they'll call me?  They seriously should be begging me to go back.  I did more for that store than everybody else that has ever worked there combined.  No matter what facet of the business you're talking about, I was the best that store ever had and ever will have.  They should have called me, I shouldn't have had to call them, but I was unhappy working in Morrisville.  And then they say they'll call me?  Don't bother, I'm not going back to Robbinsville now.  Fuck that.  If you don't realise what I bring to the table enough to take my offer when I make it, I have no use for you.    Now I have to look for something outside of the pizza industry (which is probably for the best, anyway) because I really don't like working in Morrisville.  The whole mentality there stinks, and with me not working full-time, I doubt I can do anything to change it.  Plus, I hate working with Don.  He's so abrasive when it comes to dealing with employees.  The way he sarcastically cuts people down and such just pisses me off.  oh well, if you have any ideas as to a job I can pursue that can keep me out of these shitty pizza jobs, feel free to leave them in the comments section.  Finally, I got to see Fahrenheit 9/11 the other night.  I saw it Friday at 12:01 AM after my radio show went off the air (I stayed on until 11 PM, doing NBA draft coverage all night).  I have to say, I enjoyed it.  It was a movie targeted towards somebody like me to begin with, since I am quite liberal in my beliefs, and there wasn't a chance in hell that I'd vote for Bush.  It is important to note that while watching these films like Fahrenheit 9/11, that Michael Moore has an agenda he is trying to push, in this case to get Bush out of office.  As such, you have to take into account that he may fudge a fact here or there to get that agenda across.  While it may be an agenda I agree with, at the same time you must consider that this is ultimately a movie that has both the purposes to entertain and teach, but mostly entertain.  So if you do watch the film, keep those things in mind.  And I'm babbling now, so I will call it a night.  I'll probably give this another update on Sunday, as I seem to be falling into a schedule of updating every other day.  We'll see how long I can keep it up, but so far it's been cathartic to write these.  Until next time...fuck Domino's.
