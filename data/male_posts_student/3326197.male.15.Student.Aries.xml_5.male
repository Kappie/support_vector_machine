I'm very cold atm, i'm wearing a jumper and long pants and i got a blanket on me! I want a kitten! Gah omg everyones getting a blog it's so unfair! I wanna say of all me friends me n mel came up with it first so whoever else does it that we know (other than chris, ali and tom) are copycats and they smell like cat pee pee. Okay? Yeah, as you can tell I had a really bad day. Shehan is quite the annoyance. I want a kitten. Meh I gotta do a crapload of english homework tonight. Boo. I'm gonna go, i'll prolly post later tonight. Yours crankily, Jay.
