Surprisingly the first volume got the makers millions of dollars in profit, so did the second one, and now, the third one is about to be released. Banning the series didn't work...should I say fortunately or unfortunately?   urlLink     The makers of Bum Fights are now not only making street fighting videos, but other stupid stuff aswell like special films with the different characters who were in the original Bum Fights. My favourite one is "Bling Bling", a crack junkie, who got first noticed when he was a cleaning assistant. He has his own website now, to promote the newly released DVD about him, its hilariously stupid.   urlLink     I recommend both sites, and the trailers, however they  do  contain offensive content.
