It doesn't always bother me, but most people suck so bad at it or are in no place to judge, so that drives me up the wall. - Narcissim. There is always a time and a place for this. And like the other things that bother me, some people just suck at it or have no reason to think this way. Also, most narcissists are focused only on their good attributes and completely ignore their vices. They make no effort to improve. - Sensitive people who are offended by unpleasant truths. These people either need to find their own planet, deal with shit, or kill themselves. - Law school students. They're probably the most dim-witted group of people there is. - Teachers. Teachers have power, entitlement, and personality issues. They're generally all bad people (I'll even put my sister, a teacher in that category, because I'm not one of those sensitive pussies I mentioned above). I've had four so far who didn't act like the others and actually were what teachers should be. (Mrs. Debby Knox, Ms. Debby Knox [they're two different people, odd enough], Mr. Snell, Mr. Vapnairek) - People who make up their minds before they hear an issue (Conservatives, Liberals, Republicans, Democrats, all that stupid shit) - I find nothing more unattractive--nothing more repulsive (and I think I speak for all men who aren't swingers)-- than a female who talks openly about being attracted to different guys. The more often the worse. There is a difference between being a sexual person (after all, we're all sexual... except for Kenny Warder) and talking like an idiotic whore. Somehow, somewhere along the line, women got the idea that talking about guys (within earshot of guys)-- swooning over them-- is OK and actually will help them get guys. I've got news for you Slutty McGee; that couldn't be farther from the truth. It goes along with their dumbfuck notion that "maybe if Guy A sees me flirting like crazy with Guys B,C, and D he'll get jealous and want me." It doesnt work that way. It's a disgusting personality trait. It shows no class. It makes you look more pathetic and desperate than any guy could ever manage to look, and the only guys you can land with that tactic (if any) will be just that; guys-- not men; not intelligent, honorable, respectful men, but guys-- fat, bloated, dumb frat boys who only want their cocks sucked. - Niggers. Now, I don't mean black people (and I think you're a [subliminal]racist, piece-of-shit human being if you think that's what I meant). I love black people. What I'm talking about are those ignorant, lazy, uncivilized, murderous, apathetic sacks of shit who don't have decent jobs, try to dress like rappers, adopt the latest inner-city black lingo, and spend their paychecks on rims and spoilers when they really need to be buying their illegitimate children food and diapers. Actually, most of the niggers I know personally are white.... Fo' Rizzle? Yeah, fo' rizzle! :-\. - The recent abuse and misuse of the word "random" (seems to be most popular among goths). Jesus, people, learn to use a fucking thesaurus!    "... Disgusting."  I found this humorous.
