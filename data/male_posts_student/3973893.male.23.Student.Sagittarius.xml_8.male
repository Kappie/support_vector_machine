However I started off with  urlLink Kruder  Dorfmeister  not because they’re new to me, but because I love this album to no end and think everyone should give it a listen.       As for  urlLink The Sopranos , I just finished the first season and this is possibly one of the best series ever on television. I’m already to episode 6 in the  urlLink second season  ;)
