I have no idea of what it is called or anything else about it, other than the fact that my mom liked the style of it.  I think this is a pretty cool picture, and I give it a thumbs up.  I would be proud to wear a shirt with this picture printed on it.  I would wear the shirt to the grocery store, and to a restaurant, and maybe even to a concert or two.  That's how much I enjoy looking at this picture.  If you feel the same as I do about this photograph, raise your hands a few inches into the air and proclaim your feelings!  Because, and this is the important part folks, we all have to learn to get along with each other someday, and how will we do that without shirts?
