Ahead of us on the sidewalk was a girl wearing the sort of hipster attire fairly common in the world today, but fairly rare in Bloomington.  As such, I naturally took an interest.  She had fashionably short hair with a wide nonelastic Mary Quant/Audrey Hepburn-style print headband, an unseasonable old-school ski vest, and a knee-length skirt of a current cut.  However, as we passed her, the "girl" was revealed to be sixty, maybe sixty-five years old.  Later, as Ryan and I were waiting for the title to the scooter he had bought a few weeks ago we saw her passing by again, confirming our original diagnosis that she was indeed dressed like a record-store employee or fine art major.  I thought maybe she was just in town for the sold out Modest Mouse/Walkmen show that night (tickets were going for up to $560 the pair on eBay), but of course Ryan was too chickenshit to go over and ask her.  This, people, is the danger that the fashion-forward recovering highschool social exile must be ever vigilant against, particularly as it relates to "retro" fashion.  Remember that when you revive a fashion trend, particularly in an ironic manner, there are still people who wear that fashion, unironically, as though it had never ceased to be current;  the mullet is the most salient case in point here.  Folks, when you grow an ironic mullet, you run the risk of either offending, or even worse impressing, people with straight-faced mullets.  This is why I personally have elected to revive the characteristic flop hairstyle of the Weimar dandy (think  Swing Kids , the movie not the band).  There aren't a lot of people alive anymore who had it, and the ones who did probably have interesting stories.  I am not joking, send me a digital camera and you can have pictures.
