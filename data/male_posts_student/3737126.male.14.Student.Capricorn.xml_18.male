For the first time, I'm not confident,and I don't want to count the eggs before they hatch. I hope to get higher grades so I'm pretty silent.  2. NEWSFLASH!!! May 'kasama' daw tayo sa Tanglaw room. Dalawa. Sinabi ni Ms. Anasta kanina.  3. Music project. Still on a research on the least favored subject.  4. YM!!!!! GUMAGANA NA!!!!  5. At may exams pa bukas.  Sige, aral na ako...
