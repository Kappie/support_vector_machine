I feel boxed in, trapped by my own self with one way out, and it's a fast and furious sprint out of the way of the buildings I have crumbled.  "What sad-sad-sad scene this is.  I've troubled myself to open a locked door; blind to the inversion of total and un-natural worthlessness"  The bounty of self-beating is great.  I can beat my self to a bloody pulp and gain a wealth of knowlege only once.  I know this doesn't make sense--that is just what is in my head.  I always think clearly at these moments after the drag is over.  I can't stop my pointless bull-shit sometimes.  I wonder how many people today, on their internet journal are saying things like "My life sucks!" or "I hate everything about myself."    It's easy to feel that way, it's almost hip and cool to feel bad; maybe, it's EMO!  At this moment I am listening to some mp3's of geoff farina.  Sounds alot like an acoustic karate.  It's the lead singer/guitar player from karate.  They guy is just amazing, I can absolute connect with what I hear most of the time. The world is all just a poem or a line from a song.  Every opinion can be assumed or boldly presented from shit like that.  I feel very pretty, hot even.  I have mad sex appeal.  haha.  Do I believe that?  What a sack of poo pies!  I am getting married in exactly ONE month!   Woah, i felt that heavy sinking feeling.  Not about getting married, but about the fact that I feel so overwhelmed with preparation.   MiMi and I are getting the cake, the decor, the tux, the rings, the place, the invites, and tons of stuff.  Oh man, I hope this goes well.  I still don't have a person to marry us.  At least after today I can go get the marriage license out of the way.  Pray for me and my mimi!?!  $%!%*!@$#!___q434@(#*@)(#!*@)#(*!@#)$#!@$
