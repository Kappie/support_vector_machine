Siva ate some bread, then we walked around the school. Mainly we went to our classroom. Oh my! How things changed! Ha! 4/5 left a bit of ourselves on the walls. Those double-sided tapes still remained there! HaHa! After that, we went down to the hall.  HaHa! I met Wendy and Hann and Ping! So happy to see them! HaHa! We were soon joined by the rest of the cats. Miss Tan came and took our attendance, and showed us where we are supposed to seat.   We have to wait for a while though. Waiting for the guest-of-honor, Mr Something (Ayiah...I forgot his name le. Oh yes! Richard Soh? Is it Soh? Ayiah..never mind la) to arrive at 8.25.  Hmm. Yeah. He arrived quite punctually, then the school song was played. Ayioh..they removed the lyrics. They are making the pupils sing. HaHa! Only the Riversidians in front sang. Meow!  After that was the introductory speech by Mrs Singh. Blah blah blah. Ayioh...so boring.   After the speech were the prizes being given away. YaY! The prizes for top Sec 1-3 last year were awarded. After that...it's us!  Miss Tan told us to collect the prizes then leave. Hann insist on staying there for bask in the limelight. HaHa. He did that, but they were shooed off stage. I collected my trophy, and left. What a beautiful cup-trophy thingy award! I was given the "Passion In Learning" award for scoring 5 distinctions!   HaHa! After the ceremony, the school took some pics of us. Hmm, after that was the reception. We mingled around to talk to the teachers. We mingled, we ate and we talked.   At 10+, we went off lor. HaHa. No la. Hann wanted to go kaypoh at the parent-teacher meeting, so me, Hann, XC, Amanda, Wendy and Ping went around to tour the classroom blocks. We first went into Mr Du's classroom. That Hann ar! We left soon after. Then, we went into Mr Tsung's classroom. Ayioh! HaHa! We also left..then continued touring until the end lor.  HaHa. All of us then took the bus to Woodlands. Hmm. I went home first. I am joining them later for steamboat. I don't wanna go out.   I went back home, ate lunch (instant noodles), watched taped Pokemon then come online. HaHa. I left at 3.25 to meet Gloria lor. We then travelled to Woodlands to meet the rest.  PY, me, Gloira, Joyce and ShuQiang went to Marina Bay first. We are supposed to meet the rest at the restaurants. Oh well. Ha. When reaching Marina Bay, we decided not to take the bus there, instead, walking. I prophesized that Hann they all will pass us in the bus. Well, they did. But they weren't early. We are earlier! :P  We didn't go to Zheng Fa to eat. We went to this other restuarant that is cheaper ($10) and we can use other plates. HaHa! They have less variety though. Oh well. Got hams can le. :P  Yeah. I gorged myself silly! That PY is partly at fault! Take so much food! Nobody wanted to eat, so I gorbled the rice and noodles down. Adding to that, my hams were tad uncooked. Ayioh! I also ate down two bowls of fake shark fins. Now, I am helpless in the face of shark fin, real or fake. Oh my my!   At the end...my stomach hurts...a lot! Oh my god! Me and Gloria took a walk...and my stomach was hurting! It felt like it's gonna burst! I think I know how pregnant women felt! Oh god.. I can't walk at all! I felt so breathless. Gloria went to seek help. Joyce they all came and told me the toilet is in the pool place.  I went in in there and vommitted all my dinner out. Yeah. I could 'taste' the dinner. Heh Heh. Yeah...my stomach immediately felt so much better. I also felt hungier. HaHa!  Heh. I ate some fruits and talked for a while. After that, we left lor. The rest went to play pool at Causeway Point, while me and Gloria. Joyce, PY and Hann did some  interesting  stuff. Ayioh! You cats ar!! Zhen si de!   Oh yes. I reached home at 9+, to the surprise of my parents. Woah! HaHa! Yeah...first time I returned from a steamboat outing so early. Heh Heh. Anyway, after bathing, I watched Miss USA. I didn't actually watch, as I fell asleep halfway. I woke up to catch Miss Missouri win that title. Oh I meow!    TODAY   Oh! Today was nothing la. Heh HEh. Waking up, eating black carrot cake for breakfast. Heh.   For lunch, we went to Admiralty Place. I ate xiao wan mian. Mother went there to collect her Tupperware and Father's driving us there. Yeah. He drove us back too. Meow!  Hmm. I am online ever since. I am meeting Ben later to eat dinner. Meow meow!   Okay. I am supposed to study for Maths test tomorrow. I don't have the drive to leh. How? Sigh... Study tomorrow lor.  Tonight ar? I think I am gonna surf the net, then go to sleep. Heh Heh. Meeting CQ tomorrow to go to MT Oral test. Meow!  Okay. I gotta go liao! See ya next time!
