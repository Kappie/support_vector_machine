And my mom says "thanksgiving! we are going to your grandparents' house!"  I said "I thought we were having thanksgiving at our house this year!"  They said "No... we ALWAYS have thanksgiving at our grandparents house, remember?"  "Mom! We had thanksgiving at our house last year!"  'Well... umm... get up!"  Grr.  Sometimes they forget things that are impossible to forget, like they're afraid of the consequences if they do remember.  My mom keeps coming into my room and asking "is everything okay?" like she doesn't know that I would rather not spend my day sitting in a house in lindale while a bunch of older people talk about stuff i don't really care about.  I know she knows, and she knows that i know that she knows.  But, she still expects an answer from me, but if i give her the truth, she'll get pissed.  Ugh.  Have a.... thanksgiving.
