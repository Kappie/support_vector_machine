This new website (http://www.gmailswap.com/) offers help to people who are looking for a GMail account (As of now, GMail by Google is still in development, and trial accounts are being offered only to a select ``few'').  So, this website hints that `active' Bloggers can possibly get GMail accounts... I had not posted for a while, and so here goes...  I want a GMail account too. Its got 1G storage for goodness' sakes!
