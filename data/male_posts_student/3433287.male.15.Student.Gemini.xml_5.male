Today was alright, had tons of those mixed feeling things but now im sittin here in some sweat pants waiting for my clothe to wash and dry.  You want to hear about my day?...sure hope so, caus im telling you anyway...  Woke up bout 5 times last night, mind couldnt comprehend what the eyes saw each time, so i eventually fell back asleep.  Got out of bed 2 minutes to late agian, but thankfuilly my alarm clock is set 9 minutes head...so i has 7 minutes till the bus came.  Did the good 'ol smell and wear technique, used by guys all over the world.  If you do now know what that is, tsk tsk tsk.  Put on those clothes and scrambled for some dreaded socks, which i have to wear now caus the fucking pool got shut down so i cant swim in gym anymore, so i need socks.  Finally make it out of the door and complete my daily jog to the bus stop/aka/the end of my long drive way. Bus comes, after i finish picking up the recycling the fucking racoons torn everywhere.  Get on the bus, thats always the same, same seat same station same mood...dead.  Bus gets me to school, thats all i care.  WE MADE IT TO SCHOOL!:)...ha ha ha.  As im walking through the fucking church door entrance looking main doorway, whoever designed it is fucked up.  Make a dirty face and flash the Rock On hand sign to the camera as usual...bastards.  I'll skip telling you about english, caus it sucked, were reading Juliet and Romeo, and ive learned one thing over the course of reading this book. Be More Observant!...you will understand sooner or later.  Gym sucked caus we played softball, with like 20 kids on each team, i would have rather ran the mile...anyways...3rd hour German! WOO, i did my homework this time, but Herr Ruth called on me alot more than usual, he doesnt trust me when i say Ja, to doing my homework:(    4th hour biology, ill say this, I love you man, Who wants chipperiffics?  Lunch was alright, one of my good friends, who also happens to be my Jewish Brother, Justin...told this kick ass story that he was making up on the spot for like 15 minutes and had us all laughing our asses off...whew!:) After lunch, the class right after, is always a drag, its a bald man who has a super ego and makes corny jokes...and on top of that teaches Geography...WTF?  So i read my book in that class, whew Reading! whew SPIRITWALKER! 7th hour happens to be ONE of my liked classes, not for the class, but because of the people...but its math, so they kindof cancel eachother out:) 8th hour i only like for the following reasons: Its the last hour of the day, and its keyboarding class, the stupidest class ever, every kid knows how to type now, its so lame. Got home and did some stuff for my dad, got 20 bucks out of him...yet he still owes me 200...hmm So we skip ahead a little while end up where we are now, with me sitting here in some sweat pants...yeah...just sweat pants and socks typing this long post which right before i post it it will probaly get deleted something...QUICK...*copy's writing*
