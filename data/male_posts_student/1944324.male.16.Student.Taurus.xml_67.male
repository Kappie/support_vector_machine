You let your sister on here?!  lol not that I don't like you, Lar, it's just...I liked being the only girl on here!!! lol because then I could feel like all these guys are swooning over me...even if they are a bunch of geeks.  lol, but, you know, nice, funny, good friend geeks.  I should probably stop talking now.  But, yeah!!! Let's rent The Producers!!!  That's such a smart idea!  I'm so glad I thought of it!!!  lol...where's that from?  The Lion King, maybe?  Timon and Pumba?  Something?   lol I don't know...anyways.  SQEE!
