During my wanderings I came across a pet shop...        Before I continue I must stress that I wouldn't count myself as a Radical Animal Rights Activist,        For that matter I wouldn't call myself a pet lover...Or even Pet Owner  ( ever)       but still, it was quite disturbing seeing the dogs in 1m by 1m by 1m perspex boxes...        There were 2 or 3 dogs in each box, and it was a row of boxes, with another row directly on top...        Wire lined the bottom of each box, presumably air holes have been drilled somewhere...        and it was  filthy         Some of the puppys were rolling in their own excrement, others were busy licking the behinds of their compatriots...        A young girl pointed her finger at one puppy, who immediately started to lick the spot where her finger was pressed against the glass...        This continued, even long after the girl had left...        Two guys walked past,         Ha! look at that fucked up dog!        Strange how animal rights activists never got on the case of pet shops...        :/        Until next time:        God doesn't protect fools or young children...        No, He leaves that for Persons with a charitable mentality and Parents...        Thank NEEITS (that's Non Existing Entity In The Sky, "Thank You" to Claire for that term ^^;;) I'm neither...        Meh...
