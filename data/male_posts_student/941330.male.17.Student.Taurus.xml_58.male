Darn obligations and all that. (stupid word automatically capitalizing first words.) They can add words to the dictionary, so why not get rid of them? What a nasty word, "obligation." It implies being told to do something. Who likes to be forced to do stuff? Why not make it something pleasant...like..."gobblegook." Happy connotations.  Well, yesterday wasn't too bad. science was COOOO000o00o0L. first they blew up moles which was excitingly underwhelming. Then she lit some methanol...wha-POW. Everyone slid back about 20 seats cuz we were scared we would die on the last week of school. Coolest thing we've done all year...but that's not saying much. Mandarin, we got awards...I got the "turning around to talk to someone else the most" certificate. W00t. and mrs. Howell is gonna teach mandarin 3 next year...noooo, we can't mess with the icky freshmen -- I mean sophomores from mandarin 2.   after school, Stephanie fok was jumping out of her clothes like she got electrocuted cuz she took a picture with that "asian version of ben Affleck," but he was staring at the camera like it was a panoramic pic or something. then I went with tammy, Kristen, Nicole, Jason, david, tasha, and jenny to watch finding nemo. I saw a 3000gt, again...they're everywhere. You almost see them more than supras. David has a bunch of b's, but he's like, "I don't care cuz it's freshman year." Oh, the state of youngsters in society today. O yea, one word to the wise, if you want to pay someone back for buying your movie tickets -- esp if it's a girl -- do NOT put the dollar in their pants pocket. The movie was alright, but I thot marlin? was pretty frickin annoying. The short in the beginning with the snowman and the hot mermaid, almost like the Lipton Ice snowman or something. And the scarred fish...Green Goblin!  Then I got home after learning that asian parents would rather drive off a cliff than drop you off more than 10 feet away from home than humanly possible. I called alex, and he stopped by with his fan club of Amanda, tiffany, and selena. They stared in awe as alex busted crazy chords on the guitar, and gasped in terror as he licked an action figure on its painted lips. But yea, Amanda says "he's always horny," so whatever. And Eugene and erik, whatever I typed to you, that was really tiffany. Honest! Kristin kreuk isn't THAT ugly. Then alex busted out on my brother's recorder. It was almost like listening to beethoven's ninth reinvented. Played on a recorder. By someone who hasn't used it for about 5 years. I caught Amanda starin out of my window serenely...prolly just checkin out guys or whatever. I don't blame her, maybe she expected me to go walk outside or something :-D then we played street and Amanda and tiffany got brutalized. I was disappointed, where was amanda's legendary bball instinct? Or something like that. Then I played alex and he beat me. Fluke! Yeaa. That's about it for yesterday.   Then today I just bought my dad's father's day gift, and skipped the car wash. Sorry guys, but yea I thot it wasn't as important. Weird, but I've never given my dad a real father's day gift before, so I felt I might as well do it now. And I went to hypernet with adam, basho, josh gerber, and the famed "jake" (moriaki). I never knew he was asian. Then I got awped so many times that I memorized every death animation. Ok, I'm kidding there. Adam's pretty good at awping for somebody who only plays at pat's house. Maybe he lives there during summers, dun dun dun...  Played some basketball tonight, and that's about it. O yeaa...harry potter and the order of the phoenix countdown...one week! =O
