I called up SIM and asked about my special panel letter, and they referred me to RELC. So i called RELC, and this is the conversation........  me: May i know what kind of additional documents the letter is referring to? relc: Ok nvm, u tell me ur ic number and i check for u After a few seconds, relc: ok, ur maths is not enough to qualify for this course me: oh, but i took bridging maths in SIM relc: oh, then did u state inside the application form me: erm.. no relc: oh tats why lar relc: nvm, u just send us an email with ur particulars and we will check and submit ur application again  So as u can see, the bloody ting is cocked up! Wat the fuck sia! So i immediately send the bloody email and called up my coz adminstrator, and she only knew about tis cocked up when i told her about tis case. And she agreed that the application form did not state clearly, Fucked up.. hope they dun cocked up my email again, or else sure complain until they die!   Current Mood:  Fucked-up
