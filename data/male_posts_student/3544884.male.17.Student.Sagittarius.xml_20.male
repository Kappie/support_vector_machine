Such a friendly way you captivate my every thought when you look my way, such a friendly way, when your eyes go a certain way, such a friendly whisper in my ear, to tell me something, to make me smile, such a friendly way, I make you laugh, you say my name in a way that no one else can do, such a friendly way, we walk in class, a little world people call our own, when we are together such a friendly gaze, we got lost in went through a maze or the school hall we find each other.   But we are just friends right?....  so we say...                                 by C.V.
