If mtv says it's cool, half the teens in the world will think it's cool. The minds of teenagers and children and easy to manipulate, and brainwash. There's really not much we can do about it. I think it's safe to say that more people will believe mtv/abercrombie/etc rather than a few kids who can actually see the truth, or at least something near the truth.  If everyone wants to fuck around, it's their choice. In fact, I have a friend who lost her virginity earlier this summer. She's only 13, and she did it with some older guy. The guy, I've heard, only likes girls who are pretty and easy. I lost a ton of respect for her.   We can hope that they'll understand someday (although hope is usually just a waste). It just sucks how so many people lack common sense these days.
