We were at work, eyes looking at the computer monitor, left hand and fingers holding my face, my forearm standing straight, and my elbow loyally supporting all the weight of my head against the desk. But unexpectedly, for reasons that I have not figured out yet, the little fellow scratched my right eye. Seemingly, my eyelid played its role in this kind of agitated cartel; it stayed wide open letting me experience this insurgency. I was blind for about one minute keeping my eyes closed thinking how all this happened. It is not like I have been giving reasons to my fingers to rebel against me. I wash them everyday and cut their nails weekly. On their side, they are good guys, I mean, some times they let drop glasses full of water or particularly fragile objects; but besides that we have always been in the same team. Furthermore, we’ve been together for over 23 years, come on, I respect them, they should do the same. I pictured my eye just like those scratched sunglasses or goggles you put on and you can actually see the mark. I thought I was going to have to polish the surface or order a replacement. I even looked for a mirror to try to find a visible scratch on my cornea. Yet, I didn’t find any more reasons to feel disconcerted. For the rest of the day my eye was hopelessly sensitive to any bright light.  But today, after tedious protocols and lots of lobbying, we signed a treaty. Some cells died for it, and some others were taken directly to the nearest infirmary. They decided to help my finger make up its defiance. Thanks to that, my eye feels fresh and renovated, like nothing ever happened. My eyelid blinked “I’m sorry” and we all promised to look out for each other just like in the old days. We are just terribly alive.
