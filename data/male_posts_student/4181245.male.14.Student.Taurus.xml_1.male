Tomorrow is exams…Now,I’ve no mood to study..But I’ve told myself studie first..Actually,I came to write my blog to let go of my feelings..a sort of.. Ok…but whatever it is,I want to try to change myself to a better person..I think I will follow my instincts…because usually,I am very easily get influenced  by my friends to do bad things…Right now, its harder for me to breathe…Hey..if you are reading this,you know what I meant…I’m trying to forgot this situation..  Tommorow is exams..i felt a little bit okok as I think I’ve prepared my exams..i think about 60% only..Actually, I hope everything will go well tomorrow..Exams..Actually,I should’nt writing this blog..AR!!!!!!!!
