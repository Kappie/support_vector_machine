To some it means to dislike, or have a wish to change, a past event.  To me it is that, and much more.  It is also a lifestyle for me.  Some that know me well might call me a perfectionist.  This is so true.  All of my life I've been 'go big or go home.'  Every night I think about the mistakes of the past.  A better comparison to me would be a werewolf.  Every full-moon a beast is summoned from within me.  Then it feels like it feeds upon my mind.  There are too many past stories to share in this one entry, but I'll share what last night, particularly, was about . . .  Well, I guess I should begin with me coming to Virginia.  I moved here and met a very nice girl named Andi.  She's fun and kool to hang out with.  I mean, yes I liked her at first, but we've been good friends for about a year now.  Anyhow, as the year went by she had a birthday come up.  I, of course, was invited.  So when I show up I meet this frined of hers named Kellie.  Wow.  Kellie is so down to earth and her sense of humor is exactly like mine.  We clicked right off the bat.  So then after the party, about 2 weeks after, to be exact, we start talking more and we eventually start going out.  It's amazing.  She's awesome to talk to and is a very caring person.  Then, we take a break.  Kellie had some family-issues to deal with.  I'm perfectly fine with that.  My family is jerry-springerish, so I know all about that, haha.  For the next 2 months me and Kellie talk on and off.  Sparatically I guess you could say.  Then SHE has a birthday coming up.  I was invited months ago, so I called her up and asked if I was still welcome.  She told me that she'd love for me to some, so I did.  I show up at her party and it's me and 7 girl . . . yeh, you heard me SEVEN, lol.  Anyhow, me and Kellie just say our hellos and I plant myself on her couch.  Now, I know I'm not the best looking guy, so I don't quite understand the next series of events...  After about 10 minutes of my presence at the party I'm being hung over by atleast 2 women at a time.  It was a very wonderful feeling, but it's not what I wanted.  I would've prefered a nice, quiet dinner with just Kellie and me.  Anyhow, later on that night we go for a walk at 11PM . . . and there is a full-moon :D, lol.  There are 8 of us, so we split into groups of 4's.  Kellie isn't in my group.  Then my group of 4 breaks down further into a group of 2.  That leaves me and one girl, named Melissa.  Me and Melissa had been talking some during the party.  She's a very level-headed girl and very fun to talk to, but at the time I still liked Kellie.  Hell, I was talking about her non-stop to Melissa.  Anyways, we keep walking and one thing leads to another.  The next moment she turns to kiss me.  I am a tad surprised by this.  Then what goes thru my mind is:  "I'm at my ex-gf's birthday party and I don't even think Kellie likes me anymore.  Why not?"  So then me and Melissa start making out.  But then about half-way thru I pull away.  That's not who I wanted to be kissing.  Later on Kellie finds out.  I don't exactly tell her right off the bat, but I come clean by the end of the night.  I find out that she still does like me, and that she's very upset about all of this.  Well then I felt like an ass because if I knew that, I would've told the other 6 girls to fuck off.  Kellie didn't know how much I actually just wanted to be with her.  Anyhow, after the party me and Kellie talk some and try to start up again.  I ask her out and we schedule a time, but she doesn't show.  So then for the next 2 weeks after that I can't get in touch with her.  Later I talk to Andi, her friend, and find out that Kellie thinks I lied to her, which I didn't.  To this day I still don't exactly know what Kellie was told, but I am certain that it is false, or that it can be cleared up.  Kellie won't accept my calls or ANYTHING.  I think she's being very immature and should atleast talk to me about it.  Regardless, that is not what I regret . . .  What I regret is the fact that me and Kellie couldn't have found out what we could've had together.  I mean, we weren't exactly in love or attached, so I'm not tore up about losing her.  Also, I regret that if I knew that night at her party was the last night I'd see her as my friend, then I never would've left.  I actually hope she sees this.  Hopefully it'll clear some of her misconceptions up.  Regardless, this is just another scar to add the my arm of regret.  That is all.
