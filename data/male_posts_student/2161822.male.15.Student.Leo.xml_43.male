But I don't think it will happen. ...Again. I really have nothing to write about today. Yesterday was pretty cool. No school. Didn't do anything except go bowling. Which I owned a certain someone in. Yeah you know it. This blog is gonna be a filler since there's nothing to write about. Everday I find myself playing tetris more often. Why tetris? Only because it's the greatest game in the world. I mean come on, who doesn't like to sit down and watch a bunch of colored blocks fall down in strategic patterns? Exactly my point. I hafta say, I'm impressed with Hafey's heating system. Ok. I go to homeroom, not too bad. Not too hot nor too cold. Then I go to the cafeteria and it's like 90° in there. Then I go to the Spanish room where it's -30­­°. You gotta love it. Hmm. What am I doing now? Sitting here listening to music (Stone Sour) and writing in this.   Listen to H.I.M.
