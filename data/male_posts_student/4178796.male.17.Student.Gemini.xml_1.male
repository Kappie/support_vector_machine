Naugle and some other girls that Alicia and I called monet paintings... well... just about 4 lanes down were Emily, Lydia, Matt, Britta, and Nick (:s) well... recently Nick has been starting shit with me... and taking things to seriously... its just too much to explain... well.. yesterday he posted a blog that said "I'm going to kick your ass tomorrow" what the hell? hes acting like hes in grade school... and come to find out he supposedly "talked" to my brother.. because he didnt want him to "get in the way of us" thats complete bullshit.. I hate how he fucking lies all the damn time.. it makes me want to shoot him or something... hes so immature, not to mention that he lies all the time... and its sad.. because he just wants to be a part of Emily and Matts "clique" but will never be... I know Julie, and I know... I'm guessing Alicia is beginning to find out. and Nick is the next one.. you just can't be a part of THEM you have to kiss ass for them to give you a little bit of respect... but thats my view on it anyway. During all this time, reading the comments I would just think to myself... you know what... I can't wait till I leave.. and get away from everyone. move away and make someone of my self, and treat them the same way they treat me... like shit. all of this I'm mostly saying is directed towards Emily and Nick... Matt's never really been mean to me... but I'm sure hes talked major shit on me.. and thats ok.. I don't really care.. I do the same.. and I need to stop..  on a lighter subject... school is one day closer... I'm so tired of sitting around having nothing to do... I need something to do... and I need a job, oh and while were on that topic.. I was at the bowling alley (as you know) and Jason and I are talking about Target and how they are hiring. well he comes right out and says "well you MIGHT NOT get it.. because I mean we just hired alot of people" what the hell is that? thanks alot for crushing the only hope I have for getting a job.. could you be more honest!? ughhh! I'm so angry at so many things right now. another thing to add to that list is my dad paided child support.. yay! right? no, it was a whopping 52 dollars... I'm so pissed off... I need a car next year, and I'm not saying that in a greedy way.. I need a way to get back and forth to rehearsals for productions.. and when I get a job, I'll need a way to get back and forth to that... so unless he wants to take me to all these places... he needs to pay. He came over today... and asked me if I wanted to come to "grandma and grandpa's for dinner" I was tempted to say no, but I'm thinking the only reason I want to go over there... so I can confront him and tell him to pay.... ugh.. again.. it makes me mad... I'm going to go for now.. theres nothing to do around here.. I told Julie to call me if she does anything.. but I dont know if she will... bye  nyny
