Here it is:  Love has the unfortunate tendency to tear to shreds the comfort and stability that we manage to fashion for ourselves. So, why do we always keep hoping for it if it just ends up scarring us for the rest of our lives? Some say that it's so we can learn, and be better people. Learn for what, the next time love mauls us? No thanks. And not everyone becomes a better person afterwards. Some become psychotics, or recluses, or narcissists, even. Trust me. I know. And yet, some others don't learn or become better people. They just keep on living life and getting hurt by those they love. So, I guess the point of this entry is to try to convince you of something, but I'm not exactly sure what. Um...oops...   I like this. It speaks the truth.  However, There are other views that can be taken on this heartwrenching subject. This person did not list the other outcome of love. If love works out for you, it can be the best thing that can ever happen to you. It can make you become a better person, a happier one. This person's view on their side of love is very accurate and well supported, in my opinion. But the the other type of love, if you are lucky, will happen first..   oh who am i kidding i know nothing about love have a good rest of the night people and props to alexi, nice article
