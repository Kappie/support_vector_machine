It was a good movie, and one that I'll probably be adding to my DVD collection (along with the 3 others I've seen so far this summer).  The day after tomorrow is also when I start summer school. That goes until the 18th from 7:30 to 12:45 every day, but I get credit for an entire semester course (Speech), so I'm not complaining. At least I don't have baseball to worry about this week in addition to summer school.
