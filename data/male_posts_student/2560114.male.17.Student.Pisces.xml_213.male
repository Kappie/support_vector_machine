We chilled at redondo beach and it was bitchen, i got me some new glasses that look like Bz but cost $6.50...w00t! Then jon bought a strawberry short cake kite, which was some funny shit. Then at the game, we jus murdered them...there was like no chance for them to win, we jus took care of business and did was we had to do. Today though i was tired and such, then at practice wit no food in my stomach, i wasnt doin that well. Well we play Santa Fe at our house on Friday, so it will b a good match cuz they kinda look like camarillo, so it will b fun. Well as for "chicz", idk man...sometimez those feelinz come back and i jus get down sometimez but after i saw Swingerz, which was a freakin awesome movie, i jus realized that im too good for that, so it was bitchin...payce.
