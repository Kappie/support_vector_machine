My top ten things to do in the new year    10 Eat more broccoli, hey prevent premature aging. 9  To be more accepting and kind to people I dislike. 8  Eat at regular times. 7  To have better skin. 6  To be a more conscientious student. 5  To floss more 4  To work on my body 3  To trust more  2  Milk a cow 1  To write more      "So why, now, when I hear GWB's speeches, do I think of Hitler? Why have I drawn a parallel between the Nazis and the present administration? Just one small reason -the phrase 'Never forget'. Never let this happen again. It is better to question our government - because it really can happen here - than to ignore the possibility. "   It is interesting to say that it is immoral to kill for the sake of food. This concept even seems foreign to me. I am curious why it might be considered immoral to kill for food. True, humans are omnivorous and could get along fine without meat, but that doesn't make it immoral to eat the flesh of an animal. Considering the laws of the jungle it only seems appropriate to kill for food. Take the bear for example (also omnivorous); there are many different types of food on a bear's pallet from berries to fish. And the polar bear, which relies mostly on meat, will eat anything from baby seals to baby walrus. That is simply the way this planet operates. And people, being inhabitants of this planet fall under these same guidelines for survival. The ecology of this planet relies on its inhabitants' killing to "prune" for new growth.  This is not to say that the animal diet of humans is not unbalanced and perhaps even gluttonous, but to say that it is immoral to kill an animal for its meat seems to me to be ridiculous. As the most intelligent species on this planet some might say that it is our responsibility to rise beyond the seemingly barbaric law of the wild. I think the being the most intelligent species merely means we are responsible for maintaining this planet for all its inhabitants, and eating meat does not even enter that picture.  Upon comparing the slaughter of thousands or even millions of animals to the slaughter that took place during the Holocaust is not possible for two reasons. 1)The Holocaust was man turning on its own species in murder and genocide and very rarely in nature is cannibalism witnessed, which brings me to number 2)The death of the millions of Jews and gypsies was not because Nazi Germany thought they might taste good with potatoes and wine. To kill for food is not murder, no matter how you look at it.   So is it immoral to kill another animal for food because it causes that animal pain? I think that all depends on a person's own feelings about animals. It is observed in nature that the superior animals or predators kill without thought of how much pain is administered. When a lion sinks its claws into the antelope's rear legs to immobilize it the pain felt by the antelope must be excruciating, but a lion does this not to cause pain to the animal but because it is the most efficient way of ensuring it and its young a meal. Likewise. when a cow dies for human consumption it is done in a very humane manner and the animal feels very little pain if any. So why then is it immoral to commit this act? Although it is arguable whether or not causing pain in this way is even immoral.  Let's look for a moment at the hypothetical situation of a "trans-human" species coming to Earth for a new and different food (human flesh). This is not something humans should accept, but if humans should die for this new species' meal is it wrong? I personally don't see how it could be considered immoral. As long the Earth's ecosystem is not collapsed by this new presence what wrong is being committed? The lives of the humans would certainly change from management of a planet to simple survival making us the same as the wild animals that inhabit the planet. Here is the harsh truth: if the aliens were to take my mother away for their next barbecue there would still be no wrong committed. I would hate the aliens for taking my mother from my family and I would want very much to retaliate, but that does not change the morality of the acts being committed.   Really, I cannot say whether I am right or wrong in saying these things; only that upon observations of this planet and its inhabitants I cannot agree with the idea that killing another animal for food is wrong based on the fact that it causes that animal pain. Pain is a natural part of this world and should be accepted as such. Life, pain and death are all inevitable in this world and the natural way of things.
