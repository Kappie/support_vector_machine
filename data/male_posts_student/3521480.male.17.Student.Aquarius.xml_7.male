I was extremely glad they initiated Mr. Ballard as an official headmaster, he really did bring a lot to the school, and i wish he could stay on as headmaster. But alas, all good things have to end. Im sorta glad i didnt go, as i would imagine i wouldve gotten a bit squirmish due to the length of the speeches. Funny thing, when the one lady (wasnt paying attention aenough to remember her name) mentioned something about same sex marriage or gay and lesbian marriage, the camera immediately went to Mark Kharas for the one and only time during the graduation. Funny how that works... Also, what was the deal with Tiffany?!?! i looked away for a moment, and then the crowd started cheering like crazy. Can someone plz fill me in.  Otherwise, ive been relaxing and studying lately. not much drama. the next few days should be busy though. A happy birthday to Stephanie and Dunn today, best wishes, and Tana's b'day is tomorrow. man, its so nice not having school :D
