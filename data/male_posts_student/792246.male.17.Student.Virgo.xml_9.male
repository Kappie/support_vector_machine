My talking cat was howling swear words. I still need to walk my dog. Ugh. I think I have a minor cold. Good times.   Jenny is the most amusing person ever. She can be totally pissed at you one night and be back to normal the next day.   Some unknown people decided to leave a very strange note on my TV. Hmm.  To anyone reading this, come abduct me. It's boring and hot here, and walking around the house naked isn't working. Someone please save me.   Those days were so boring. Wow. The "unknown" people were Tristan, Jonathan, and possibly Lizzy and Claudia, who's car broke down a few miles down the road and they needed to use my phone, even though castles don't have phones. Or something like that.
