Tonight I went to see AVP it was great.  The worst thing is I thought I saw my loves car out in the parking lot.  I was worried out of my mind about what I would do if I saw her.  I would have probably ran for some reason.  In the movie "The Village" one of the leads was affraid to do what he wanted most.  I feel like him, I am too affraid to approch her but it pains me that I won't.  Well I better get back to vegging, goodnight.
