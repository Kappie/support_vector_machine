Sometimes I don't even sleep and stay awake through the night like today for example, and the very reason that I'm writing this.  Did I mention I'm 16........Anyway I am, and My B-day is June 29 (5 days from now).  So that means I still go to school and there's this punishment called "Summer school" that you receive for not doing your work in class.  And guess who's the lucky person that gets that beautiful prize?  You guessed it. It's almost over and that means I get to have my head glued to computer monitor all day.^_^  And now for that Naruto. If you haven't heard of this anime before  Anyway it's over for now see you later!         ^_^ anime rules!   urlLink narutofan.com      urlLink narutochaos.com        the bigger the cushion, the better the pushing -fat clown from "House of a Thousand Corpses"
