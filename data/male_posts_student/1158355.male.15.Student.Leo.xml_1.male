After the test I made a sick video on Windows Movie Maker 2... this took like 2 hours, you can im me if you want it. All day I just lumped around playing gamecube and going on the computer. When Pat, Chris and Jimmy came over we just lumped around laughing and screaming listening to Chris's awesome underground techno music... and U2. Chris said "gay load", it was the funny of the day. Ya... thats all that happened. I think I might go neighborhood terrorizing late tonight!
