I've crawled out of the crawlspace to post some new updates to my blog, I wouldn't like anyone not to know whats goin on in my life:  1.02 PM - scratched ass 1.03 PM - blinked repeatedly 1.04 - 1.35 - moshed to Opeth "Black Rose Immortal" (actually is 30 mins long...)  Hehe!  Anyway, so... what to do now? Nowhere near so happy about things, my job is a complete shit hole, I can barely stand it anymore. All my friends are going away, havn't spoken to anyone properly for ages... Luckily I got peeps like Emma and Joe there to stick up for me. So, Thanks Joe, it wasn't as bad as all that really. We're still friends, and good ones I believe. I am glad for that, as it would be worse if things just stopped, and things disappeared  Yes, we're still friends, which is great, I wouldn't want it any other way. Ok, it hurts, it really hurts, and a lot of things I wish I didn't have to think about I now do... but at least I'm not hiding from them, much... and with people like Joe and Emma there to keep me sane, it will work...  All I've got to do is keep sane with this work deal... I've earnt myself £60 and will have £150 by the end of the week. If I last that long... he wants to fire me, he's always bitching and complaining. Ahh well... struggle on I will.   Will write again tomorrow. Hopefully  Dxx
