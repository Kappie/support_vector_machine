Inside, the photo guy is no where to be found and then he looks surprised when I give him a "Go to Hell" look when he arrives. WTF are you doing!! I go outside and some fucking cart pusher asks me if I have a cigarette to spare. I don't fucking smoke.  Give it a rest people!   I had all the interaction i can take for one day.
