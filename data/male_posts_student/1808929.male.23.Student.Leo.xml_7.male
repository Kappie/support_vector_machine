[Currently I'm listening to "Trying" by Lifehouse]. I had no idea that I would like this song so much, but the computer program anticipated what kind of music I might like based on the prior music ratings that I've given it over the last 3 months. It's almost like some sort of symbiotic relationship between the internet and me: I get great music and the internet learns how I enjoy my music (along with millions of others) so that it can make more money. Sounds like a good deal to me!      I talked with my mother earlier in the day and she gave me the whole "23 years ago I was pregnant and it was hotter than hell" story. For those of you who don't know, the summer of 1980 was one of the hottest summers on record and it wasn't a great time to be pregnant. [Currently listening to "Storms" by Fleetwood Mac]   You know, it's funny what we chose to remember. I can't remember most of my birthdays, but I do remember my 5th, 10th, 17th, and 19th birthdays. There was something about them that just stuck with me. My fifth birthday was my FIREMAN-themed birthday party. It was awesome and I had lots of friends there. For my tenth birthday I went on a bike outing at a nearby state park. At 17 my friends at Krum, Texas threw me a surprise party, which was really special since I was leaving Krum and heading to TAMS (Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science).  ["But I Do Love You" by LeAnn Rimes]  At 19 I just got royally trashed with some friends the summer between high school graduation and college. Memory is quite a powerful force, but selective as all hell. If you don't believe me, just ask Marcel Proust.       I got a birthday card from one of my best friends from Duke, Ashley Colburn, yesterday and it had a lot of pictures included. ["Live To Tell", Madonna]  These pictures were like a blast from the past. Graduation, RA awards ceremony, Myrtle Beach, random crap, etc. In many ways the scenes from 3-and-a-half months ago seemed like days, yet years ago. It's just amazing to me how all of us at Duke lived furiously, one moment to the next, not looking back and rarely looking ahead, yet in an instant it all was over. It was sad, amazing, beautiful, and all too real. ["Thank U", Alanis Morissette]  Alanis really is an amazing singer. I really like her song "Precious Illusions" also. Some of the Duke EMS emails have started up again. I look back at the three years I spent with that group as some of the most awesome years of my life; I learned more from my experience there (truthfully) than most of my classes at Duke. ["Cant Stop Loving You", Phil Collins]  Ok, this song sucks. Phil Collins songs have just gone completely sucky since about 1995 or so. His songs are now all addressed to his kids and crap, which kinda sucks for us people who loved his '80s, early 90's stuff.
