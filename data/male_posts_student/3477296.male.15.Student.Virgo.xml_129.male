I'm blogging during english because english is boring and i severly hate it at the moment,  so much work due. If anybody has anything Alfred Hitchcock and his filming career could you please send it to me. Anyway today was pretty boring. Sniffed about a dozen different organic chemicals, all marked with a label that said POISON. Felt kinda dizzy afterwards and everything smelt like hospital swabs for a while on the accout of the amount of alcohol that entered my nostrils during that 55 minute science period. Also did the ALC (Australian Language Certificate) for jap today. Was extremely hard and i was reduced to guessing aimlessly, good to see that almost everyone else was the same way, except for Yi Long because he's very good at jap. Said he didn't need to guess on any question.    Isn't something missing, isn't someone missing me...
