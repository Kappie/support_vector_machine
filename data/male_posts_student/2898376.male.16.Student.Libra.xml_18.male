The best maintained blog i have seen is Stompp's, who has posted every day of his blog! Come on guys, he already overtaken Nonnesuch!!  These people MUST post in the next 48 hours, or they shall be brutally bished:  Megatrobe Teradud (who must also shut that bloodt cantina up, before i send ETA there) Nonnesuch Wendy'  This is a little unfair. I never have anything to say, so don't. Meh. I have AN IDEA now though. Should be a post soon after this.
