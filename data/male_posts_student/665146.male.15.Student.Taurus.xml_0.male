I just hope I didn't screw up my template by putting that counter there.....  If I did.....  I have no idea what to do...    Medal of Honor.  Not much more to say about it, except, "YEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!"  It's definately a good game...  It goes up there with the scary tactics of Metal Gear Solid 2.  More to say later.........  Go america........Brainwashing kids with video games.......
