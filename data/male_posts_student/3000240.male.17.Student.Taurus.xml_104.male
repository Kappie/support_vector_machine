I'm glad I've got something stable finally - and we're of to the Imax cinema near Waterloo this weekend for some grade A geek eye wear movie viewing and Grade A* company with each other I guess if that makes any sense.  Anyway, It's England v Switzerland tonight, and I'm of to Wimbledon probably with Kate for and hour and a half of getting to know her/whilst drinking/innocent flirting with her I guess before some very graphic and audible swearing at the plasma screen - oh YAY. IF we lose this game, anything at all like the last game then I may go into some psychotic manic depression and alloy a knife to my wrist. Surprisingly, I haven't got bored of any of the football games yet - must be an indication as to what the state of my social life these day . . .  Well I'm back at college at the moment, and It's a "back to work" day, just some PC nonsense. Been ok I guess and It's no work and no pressure of exams on my mind (all be it apart from the last maths one). This week should be ok, nothing major is planned too much apart from seeing Jo which is more major I guess apart from an average movie trip. Speaking of movie trips - I went to see a film called imagining Argentina with the amazingly sweet Frances from work. It was so much better that I thought it would be, and Antonio Banderas played it really well. Anyway must be of. xBuBzx
