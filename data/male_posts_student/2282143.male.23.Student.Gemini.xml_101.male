Sammy claims John Mayer, Jen Jordt - Maroon 5, me - nothing.  Maybe Breaking Benjamin, but they havent quite hit the midwest mainstream, although I think they kick ass.  They ended up on Q101's ear candy cd, and just because of that and the other huge list of sweet music, I think I might go snag myself a copy.  But if you want a solid kick ass CD, go buy Saturate and then their new one coming out at the end of the month.  Looking forward to it.  Anyways, on to the Festivities:  Got out of work on Sunday fairly early.  The weather was crappy and there wasnt a damn person at the zoo all morning, so they released me.  After that, I took a shower and high tailed it up to the lake.  Had a wonderful sloppy joe dinner (Mrs. Low makes really good sloppy joes and I think they are from scratch) and then had a few coronas and a vodka tonic.  Thus it begins:  We then proceed to this little place called the Legacy that the girls had hung out in the previous Friday and found their favorite waitress.  Ok, so she was the only waitress they had ever had, but still.  She was cool.  There were some pretty hard core country Karaokers rocking out.  We did Jello shots, drank beer.  Sammy had her razmatazz.  There were some twin kids there, obviously way too young to be at a bar, but whatever, I guess they were the owner's nephews or something?  I dunno.  Anyways, they kept coming over to the table with stuffed animals that they won from the crane machine.  Sam then recruits them to win some toys for her, but with no luck she then tells them to stop wasting their parents money cause they are just gonna sell the toys at a garage sale anyways.  Classy.  True, but classy.  Then the one gives her a yellow elephant they won and Sam thought it was the cutest thing and all night she was saying "you gotta bury me with this when I die!"  It was funny.  So we then leave and go to BT's.  We drink downstairs, we drink upstairs at the VIP bar.  We play Keno that is played in pretty much every bar in the state of Michigan (its run by the state's lottery), which I think is a  brilliant   idea because you take advantage of the drunks of your state and hit them up for even more money.  Stellar.  Really.  Illinois could do that in Chicago and make a KILLING.  Screw a riverboat casino, fleece the drunks!  So we drink more, go back downstairs, drink more.  Dance.  Drink more.  There was a guy playing video poker (which is also for real cash I think), and Sam slaps all his buttons and he kinda freaks but then is like, whatever.  I think he was cool with it cause we werent some randoms, but relatives of Aunt Nance.  It was funny.  Then we leave (after 2 hours which we thought wasnt that long) and head back to the Legacy to finish off the night.  They sing Monkees, I laugh.  Im singing too, but just from my seat.  Listen to the video and I'm fucking God awful.  Sam and I get funky on the dance floor until I drop her, and then the bouncer comes over and says "you guys are drunk and just stumbling everywhere, so go sit down."  Being all embarrased that we got yelled at and Sam all pissed at me for dropping her, we go back to our seats.  More Karaoke, more hanging out, more drinking.  Met some girl who went to high school and hung out with this kid that I hated in grade school cause he was one of the kids who constantly made fun of me.  Not that I really care about him now, cause I would at least hope he is a different person, cause I know I am (Im more aggressive!  Right Sam?), but whatever.  I hope I wasnt too much like, "I hate that fucker" or something like that.  I could  have been, but I dont remember.  So we went back to the house after they kicked us out at close and I had to have lots of water.  Didnt help.  I was not going to have a pleasant night unless I did the unthinkable:  I made myself hurl.  Four years of the Lodge, and it takes me my girlfriend's parents to get my drunk enough to puke.  Man, thats kinda nuts...  Monday, I spent the day recovering and moving a tree limb that fell (it was pretty big, had to break out the chainsaws).  We had Sam's B-day dinner and then went back to her place.  Spent Sam's birthday mowing her lawn and doing some yard work.  Mr. Low did more stuff for the new bathroom in the basement.  Sam had work, unfortunately.  Then Mr. Low took off, Sam came home and we went out to dinner at the Fieldstone Grille.  Good stuff.  Very fancy schmancy.  Not black tie fancy, but still, very nice. Sat out on the patio, watched the rain fall, had a great dinner.  Then we went back to her place and watched a few movies.  Well, 1.5 really.  Saw Brother Bear which was cute.  Typical Disney movie.  Then we tried to watch Love Actually, but ended up falling asleep halfway through it cause it was super late.  Oh well.  Then Im a dumb ass and returned it today, but we did get 2 of the 3 rentals free, so Im dumb, but no money was lost, so whatever.  The third movie I watched this morning before I went home:  Bubba Ho-tep.  Bizzarre is the only word that can describe it because its about Elvis and JFK living in a nursing home in Texas and a mummy who has been sucking out the souls of the elderly through their asses.  Fun time.  Elvis is "posed" as a former impersonator who he switched places with, and JFK is an old black man who says he was dyed after the assassination attempt to get rid of him for good.  So they fight the mummy and win, and its just kinda ended up being about dying with dignity and how we live.  Fuck, actually, Im reaching and have NO clue what the point of the movie was.  Pretty good though.  Good acting and it was pretty funny in parts.  So then I drove home, took a shower, went to class, got a 107% on my test from Thursday, went to TKD, did a new tai chi form (Par gue or something, not really a tai chi form, but some variation or something, I dunno or something).  Had dinner at the golf course with the Tony.  Gonna go to bed now though, cause I have to watch Pips early while my ma goes out to breakfast with Val.  Good times.    Wild Rock.   PS:  Pictures are up on the right and any movies that you feel you might want to see, check out my getfile on AIM.  Just to warn you, I was drunk.  Quite drunk...
