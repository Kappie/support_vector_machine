He is younger then dominic, so he can relate better to us.  Are next game is at Dearborn Heights.   Anyways, school was shorten for the assembly -_-'.  It would not have been so bad if it wasn't so hot.  I got home and bought a calculator for math, since i should have gotten one before. moaty needs to fall in the moat.  Im going to do math, shower, then sleep  peace out G-Units
