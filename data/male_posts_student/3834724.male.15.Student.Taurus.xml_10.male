Do you think its easy to throw this habit? Man, I'm addicted to online, what do you expect? A day to change everything. Please give me time. Now, let's see. I hate to admit this, but I'm telling the truth, yes, I did fell in love with Darren, once. Yup, once. But, come on, that's just once, and that's it. Now, John is mine, and mine + mine, is still mine. I don't care whether he cared about me or not, he is still mine. Who cares if he run around with other girls. Once we are still together, he is still mine, until we break up. I *think* I know why I fell into Darren, for that one and only time. Simply because, we are toegther, like everyday online and ect. I can be with him all the time in school, kicking each other and talking plus laughing. I can't do that with John. That's the reason. So, automatically, I'll tell him everything. Duh. Meh. And I'll *try* never to fall into him, again. So, now, I like Darren and even love him, because he is my brother and that's it. He loves Punthon and that's it. And please, I dno't angry over Punthon. You are not that great yet, for me to get angry over the girl you like. John is mine, Punthon is yours. Clear? Don't mess with my boy. From today onwards, I need to avoid from telling you things about John. Might need some time, but I will change. 'Cause I don't think it's worthed to tel you, plus I don't think you're  that  interested.   I don't mind you telling me what you want to tell about Punthon, but when I'm just not in the mood to listen to you, you'll know what I'll reply. But that  doesn't  mean I'm angry at her or jealous on you guys. As I said, again, you're not that great, for me. Please mind your words, 'cause some might be real sensitive. I've got a boy, remember. I need to give him respect. I admit I always play around with my classmates with 'i love you', no matter is a girl or a boy. But they never take it seriously, so you don't need to do so, too. Ask John if you want. I don't say 'i love you' to him always. I seldom tell him so. I only tell him when I feel like. That is why, it makes my 'i love you' a little more worthed, compared to his. He always say so, but so? That's just me. I don't need to go and tell him, "Make your confessions more meaningful." I used to do so, but second thought, it's his way, so why bother? So, same to everyone, the more 'i love you' I say, the less meaning it got. That's what I think. Do you see me telling my mom 'i love you' everytime I see her? No, I don't. This doesn't mean, I dno't love her. But during her birthday, or Mother's day, I do tell her so, even kiss her sometimes. Isn't that meaningful? Compare to telling her 'i love you' EVERYDAY, and NIGHT?! Nah. Gimme a break. That's my way, but I dno't expect anyone to follow it. Meh. And sometimes, I have to say, I'm very sensitive. I think alot, even with an 'ok' a person said. That's me, me and me. Don't ask me to change, 'cause I love being myself. I don't know. When I'm writing this blog, I'm not angry or happy. I don't have any feelings when I wrote this. This is just, something who appeared in my mind, suddenly, and something asked me to write it down, so I'll feel much better, and won't be thinking about it, when I'm on my bed. Actually, I'm weird. I dont show my feelings. Great examples, is like my boyfriend. I always pretend not to care, but this doesn't mean, I want to have a fight with them. In people's eyes, thye migght think I'm cruel, but please, that's between me and him. Leave me alone. =P Anyway, to whoever I'm going to show this blog [I'll decide myself], please don't think you know me very well, and kept telling me, "I understand." or what so ever, 'cause it pissed me off, alot. And this are hints, when I'm not-so-happy about what people said on phone. 1. I get silence after your sentence. Either its because it's boring, and I no longer want to contninue it. Or I'm speechless because of your annoying attitude or what so ever. Keep that in mind. But! Sometimes, just sometimes, I need time to 'tafsir maklumat', ya know, my brain sometimes is resting or under construction, I need time to think what you're trying to say. =P 2. Don't ever repeat something you know I won't like. Unless I started that on my own. Like waht I said just now. About the silence thingy. When I'm silence, dont go, "Oh, I know you don't like what I said, sorry." or what so ever. If you knew it, SHUT THE FUCK UP and try to cahnge another topic or use your brain how to continue that conversation, or I'll just hang the phone up, and go to sleep. Meh. Tats.
