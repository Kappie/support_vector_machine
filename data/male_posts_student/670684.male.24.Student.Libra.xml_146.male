Here's where we start to dance...  My favorite argument to hear from someone is, "Well, you're not there."  Just a few weeks ago, a friend of mine and I were debating the validity of the Bible; he believes it is the Word of God, I don't believe it is authentic in the way he describes.  We talk about ideas and processes for a while, and as I'm explaing the relativity of situations and the importance of understanding the location and timeframe that work comes from, he says, "Well Rolin, how do you know that George Washington lived?  The only people who know were the ones who were there."    That argument can be refuted by looking once again at history, location, peoples of the area, common practices and beliefs...whereas 3000 years ago the pursuit of Truth wasn't important at all, 300 years ago the documentation of an event as holistically as possible was paramount.  But since he wasn't willing to listen to that, I gave him two immediate responses to his "gotta see it" train.        1)  No shit.      2)  So what?    I just wrote a scene in my screenplay where a guy watches his girlfriend get killed.  I've never seen a loved one die a horrific death.  So can I honestly write that scene?  Yes.  There is no omnipresent line of sight existing in the world.  Film only allows people to watch a certain frame, but the cinematographer cannot stop the individual watching from looking at the work from his own personal perspective.    If I make my judgements based on what I read, you're damn right, Mr. Harr, that they are shallow and only capture what was given.  However, I do not make judgements based on what I read.  What I read is just a part of the judgement I make, which is why this death was, and still is, such a big deal to me...a bigger deal than most things that happen in the world.  Everything I have seen in life, everything I have read, every conversation I have watched, every eye tick, every flick of the wrist...they all come into composite and I make a judgement.  I often try not to judge, because there are multiple sides to all issues.  But sometimes, such as in this instance, I choose to have my own.    Rachel Corrie was not protesting war?  The Israeli army has embarked on a mission of genocide over the past 20+ years upon the indigenous Palestinian people of the area.  There are a number of national groups that protest these human rights atrocities, but they get little attention, because America's number one country for receiving aid is Israel. They're our unabashed ally; what Saddam Hussein is getting bombed for is what Ariel Sharon gets money from us for. Rachel Corrie isn't protesting for America.  Why does she have to be?  I often mention my distaste with protesting...it serves self-sufficient ends, is usually begun by rich kids, seems to be more about social interaction than changing the world, looks at things from one point of view rather than an open-minded approach, etc.  But for someone to fly to Israel and tackle this problem, that takes guts.  To stand in front of a bulldozer, that's a big ass deal too.  And when that Israeli decides to continue his mission, knowing he is going to kill someone, that's a huge problem.  That's something worth looking at.  Say it's a one-time deal, that it was an accident.  But are the murders of Palestinians in similar situations accidents as well?    One of America's favorite symbols for Democracy was the unknown Chinese man standing in front of the Chinese tanks at Tienneman Square...he just stood there to stop them.  We praise that picture, show the seeds of Democracy in  Red China , and show the power of the individual to overcome adversity.  Rachel Corrie is the opposite of that extreme.  Where we want to believe in the power of the individual to stop matters, we see a girl who tried and ended up dying for her effort.  Where we see the seeds of democracy, we see a "Democratic" nation that runs its army in a Stalinist manner.  Where we champion the strength of the Tienneman Square incident, the Rachel Corrie one gets pushed back to Page 5, because she's not fighting the infidels...she's protesting a government that we support full-heartedly.    I'm upset that she's dead, yes.  But do I feel that it's not her fault?  Not at all...she chose to go out there, and knew the risks, and while they might not have seemed evident to a 23 year old (imagine Matt Foley talking about wrapping the world around your finger and putting it in your pocket), with death all around her, she should have known that she was not immune.    What kind of war do you see?  Do you see all sides of war?  I hear about the 2000 pound cluster bomb that was dropped in Iraq near where Saddam Hussein was expected to be.  I don't hear of the "collateral damage" that was the result.  Another question:  what are you more likely to believe - Henry Kissinger's report on the War in Vietnam, or Oliver Stone's PLATOON (or Francis Ford Coppola's THE DEER HUNTER)?
