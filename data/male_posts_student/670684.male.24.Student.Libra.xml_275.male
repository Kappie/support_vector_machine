I still don't really understand the point, though.  I guess it's because the majority of my friends outside of the UT circle still think of Gopher when they dial up to check email.    The kids are writing legal briefs and policy papers to send to congressmen and UN ambassadors.  Some are pretty good...the writing is better than most entry-level college stuff, though passive voice is a favorite of folks that young.  I am probably more upset with my teachers in high school for letting me get away with passive voice more than anything else, including the dastardly B I got in Finite Math from Mrs. Waits because I chose to play on the Calculus team for the school's Math Bowl...I'm gonna go with a winner any time.
