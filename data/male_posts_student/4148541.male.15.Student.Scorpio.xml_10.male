I got doom 3 Downloaded(after purchasing a legit copy I just wanted a DVD edition)  and as soon as my computer and it's misc parts come along.  Looks like cool game (demonic too) hopefully I will piss off some reverend's if I go to a Catholic School :).  I looked around at some houses today one of em was still being done...All I want is a room for 7.1 Surround sound speakers :). One of em smelled potent of smokers....and was in a wonderful location but my room would be like 7x7....  Im trying to get some irish friends but I am never anywhere to make a friend :(.  I ate some wonderful indian food for dinner and now i am full :) im going to go run on a treadmill now :)  Well I gtg now peace
