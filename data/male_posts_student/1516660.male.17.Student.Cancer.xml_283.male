ALL MY HAPPINESS IS GONE!  Anyway. Lets skip the morning and the whole hell of waiting crap and get onto the real results. I feel like crying. ALL MY TEXT! Fuck la. If I ever feel like it again, I'll come back and rewrite. I wanted to scold my friend real bad, but ergh. Don't want to do it. Besides, she got really poor grades. Don't wanna upset her.   Well, it was time for the people with 5As to be announced, No suprise here, I was on that list. Anyway, I was like dreaming, hoping for it yesterday night and today morning, but I always told myself I am a bit silly. Well, it looks like I am not silly aqnymore (ths line is supposed to be funny when I first typed this, but the effects this time is NOT right! I WANT TO CRY!). I was like very freaked out! Then, I found out that Ah Ji and Hann are also on that list! YAY! We were asked to stand up to let people appluad us. Oh meow.   Anyhoo, we were asked to go out for a photo shoot. What a meowingly meow meow photo shoot. How fun! YaY! I heard that people getting 5As and above are gonna come back during Speech Day to get a prize or something. Oh meow! My first Speech Day. Good what! Anyway, I received my results (with so many fucking kaypohs non-4/5 people crowding around...so irritating!). I got a major surprise. I passed A-Maths with B3! Woah! I was like praying for C6, and I got a B3 instead. Unbelievable (of course not. It already happened)! I will be posting my results below so you cats can take a look.  Okay. We decided to go out to celebrate. Go Pizza Hut and eat la. I don't want to talk about the milling about and deliberation....just that we arrived at Causeway Point at 5+. We ate until we were very full. Very. The rest went pooling. Me, WQ and XC didn't.     I took bus 911 to 883 to meet my mother. Meow moo meow! I walked back, took a bath, came online. Sigh. I am so sorry I sounded ultra-bitchy, but that's what I am feeling right now. I am feeling happy for my reesults la, but over this blog entry, nah. Stupid site music made this! IDIOT!  I gotta go. Watch my movie or something. Night blog.    RESULTS  EL - A2 MT - A2 Combined Humanities - A2 Biology - A2 Combined Science - A1 E-Maths - B3 A-Maths - B3
