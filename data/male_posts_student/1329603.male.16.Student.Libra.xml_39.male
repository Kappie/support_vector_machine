She writes how she feels without making it boring. Good looking blonde girl, I bow to your use of English.  OK, purely for comedy value, I've been wondering what certain peoples' reactions would be, were I to ask them out. I list them here, however I must again point out that it is purely for comic value:   1 - Caroline  As hard as I try, I can't figure out what she'd say. I believe it would run along the lines of saying "Uh" and not talking to me and the situation generally being awkward.   2 - Sally Grant  Same situation as with Caroline, although the "Uh" would more likely be a flat "no".   3 - Jasmin  I'm sure she'd be perfectly polite and sensitive, and suitably disguise the fact she was, in effect, saying "not if you were the last man alive".   4 - Miller  Not sure. I think she'd blink and either kick me, laugh at me, or walk off in shock.   5 - Iggy  She would certainly pull my ear off. And then she'd probably IGGnore me.   6 - Zoe  Well, we all know the answer, this one's already been road-tested. Heheh.   7 - Rhiannon  Difficult to tell how she'd say no. There are so many reasons, she'd only have to pick one.   8 - Sam  I think it would run along the lines of "I'm not single, you twat" and a kick to the groin. I doubt I've underestimated her subtlety there.   9 - That weird clarinet woman at CAYO  I'm not 100% whether she likes me. If she likes me, she'd laugh and say no. If not, the kick to the groin would again apply.   10 - Patrick  Heh, that'd just be hilarious. I'm not sure what he'd say but it'd be funny. ^_^. I wouldn't risk it on the grounds that he might even say yes. (joking)   11 - Rachel Bromelow  Sorry, Zoe, she's just someone I know! No idea what she'd say to the effect of "no".   12 - Rachel who is playing Mabel in Pirates of Penzance  No idea again, but she'd probably be a cross between sensitive and violent in her refusal.   13 - Alice (Caroline's friend)  Heh, it would probably run along these lines: "Hey, will you go out with me?" {No.} "Sure enough."   14 - That weird woman who looks at me on the bus but is not small  No idea. She'd laugh at some point of it though.   15 + 16 - Either of the small girls who talk to me sometimes  Hilarity. I expect they'd faint, then wake up and say "no".   17 - Saz  Saz would probably just block me.   18 - Terri  I expect she'd just look cute in a way that meant "not on your life, mate".   19 - Naomi/Nigel/Paul  She'd... God knows.   20 - Lisa (ie. Zoe's friend)  That'd be weird. She'd talk to me even less than usual.   21 - Mel  That'd be another kick to the groin.   22 - Pete  That'd be great fun. Would he say "alright, I s'pose"? We'll never know. Thank God.   23 - Seb  He'd fall off his chair. That's all he'd do. He might go into a coma after that though.   24 - One of the girls in STRS choir  Wait, there aren't any.   25 - Scott  We'd live happily ever after in a cottage made out of... no, wait, he'd just laugh, I'd laugh, and we'd both die laughing. How cool would that be?   26 - Buzzy  He'd prod me in a negative way.   27 - Cerrie (sp?)  Uh, I don't know what she'd do. She hits me really hard when she likes me. If I did that she'd probably throw me out the window.   28 - Amy  I think she'd look quizzical and walk off.   29 - Jo (Sophie's friend)  She'd be very shocked. And then say no.   30 - Sophie  No idea. Haven't talked to her for at least a year.  OK, so how sad is that? I've been through 30 people.  Quote of the day: "Hail to thee, blithe spirit! Bird thou never wert, That from Heaven, or near it, Pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of unpremeditated art."  From Percy Bysshe Shelley's   To a Skylark
