God gave me a song about a year and a half ago. I named it "Most High", and I have it finished. Well I'm a little iffy about one part. It's my first complete worship song, though. I think that God has plans for it, because He keeps bringing it up when I pray about songwriting. But the thing is there is no music. Yes, I know ... How can you have a song without music? Well there is music, but it's in a place where its going to be hard to reach... My head!  But it will come. Lord, please let it come!! I'm completely in need of it. Maybe it's already there though, and I just won't let it flow. What if it's me? Could I really be holding back God's potential for me?
