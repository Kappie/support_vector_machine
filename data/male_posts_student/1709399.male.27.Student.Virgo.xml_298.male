The biggest humbling experience for me is visiting a library.It reinforces my commitment to the tamil proverb " Katradhu Kaimannalavu , kallaadadhu ulagaalavu (Whatever you know is like the sand in your palm, whatever you do not know is the sand around the globe).As a bibliophile,the Singapore National library looks to become my best friend.The National Library at Singapore was Huge with books on every conceivable topic on the planet.Took a few books (Including one on David Ogilvy - A person I admire a lot) and learnt the tips  tricks of commuting by Singapore MRT(Train)  buses . Its a plastic world out there.You swipe a card to get in,swipe a card to get out.no tickets.no cash.                          Registered at the university today and got my medical tests done (Hope the HIV test turns out to be negative!).Met a lot of fellow students.Seems to be a great batch.Very diverse .(Culturally  academically).
