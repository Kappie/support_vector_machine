I love you. You have been gone 22 days. I love you. You have had ups and downs. I love you. You will be here in 6 days. I love you. We have many more months ahead, only they will be together. I love you.  Get the hint?  good! *mwah*  I can't see the future, lots of things change, I will admit to that. But however that future goes, I want it to be with you. I want us to both to enjoy the ride, cause yknow, im a bmw, the ultimate driving machine ;) (i know it was corny, but it made you giggle! so ha!)  oo and guess what, i think i found something out about chris and the heidi situation. No one had heard from mia in well over a month, including him. I think this is what maybe triggered interest in heidi. Turns out mia got hit by a car and was in a coma for 2 weeks. She wakes up and either calls or somehow talks to chris recently, and so yeah, think that had a part of it. or not, might all be imagination.  but anyhow, I just want to be with you. and that want is so great, nothing is going to get in the way. the love so strong that nothing can break it. you are going to get home safely, nothing is going to go wrong, and i will be able to hug you once more, kiss those wonderful lips of yours, and gaze into your gorgeous eyes.   I kinda want to spill something here too. The last two girls I got interested in both burnt me, and burnt me bad. I just wanted to say that you are wonderful, absolutely perfect in my mind, and that I trust you more than anything, and that my heart mind and life are just as much a part of you as they are me. I'm just saying that it isnt easy to get that out of me, but you more than deserve it, and you meant that much to me. I love you and want to be with you. I don't want you as a status symbol, I want you as my best friend. I don't want you just to fool around with, I want you to be around. You make think of yourself as, hell, i dont remember that long list of adjective you used that one day, but I have just one for you; perfect. I can't think of anything I don't like. I love you michelle, thru and thru. goodnite *mwah*
