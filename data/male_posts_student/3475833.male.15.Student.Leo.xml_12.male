I've decided to run/jog around my neighborhood, hopefully everyday. If I can't do it at night, I am going to try and get up earlier to run. I just want to be a good player.    I'm already working on lifting more, by going to the workouts, but I think it's time to take it into my own hands. I want to get faster, and there is only one way to do it, work on it by myself. My dad wants to get into shape and lose weight too, so I hope to run with him. That will give me more motivation. Just hopefully my dad won't give up.    Day 1 tomorrow. Get up AT 10 o'clock in the morning. Run.
