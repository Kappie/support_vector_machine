There was a team of seniors that think they are the shiznet...and then two teams comprised mostly of newbies.  A quizbowl has:    -20 questions where you just slap in and answer. (10 pts each)    -10 "bonus" questions where if you answer right you get a bonus question (10 pts  25 pts for bonus)    -Lightning round where you have a minute to answer 10 questions on a set topic. (100 pts total (10 pts each)  Our team chose  urlLink Chad  as the captain since he knows the most about everything and anything and then a little bit more. He is the man when it comes to this kind of stuff. We ended up winning all 4 of our morning rounds.  After a breif lunch we went back to the High School to see what we were seeded, if we were seeded, for the final tournament. We were seeded 5th and our Senoir team was seeded 12th...Since there were only 16 teams in a bracket...do the math...we had to play our super cocky, super brainy, senior team.    AHHH! How did you guys do!?!?!   Well to cut right to the chase we got to the lightning round and we got to go last. We were down by 20 pts...so we only had to answer 3 questions right to win. Our topic...**queues funky music** duh duh duh 70s MUSIC!!! Not to fear... urlLink Chad  and Justin know their 70s music and we won.   Our final positioning....4th out of 67 teams   To see the final results of the Preliminary rounds:                 urlLink http://garrigan.unlimitedweb.net/qb/prelim.html  To see the final results of the Play offs:                 urlLink http://garrigan.unlimitedweb.net/qb/playoff.html
