Though i have some how solve the problem, I am still not very happy with my computer. I am trying to find a job but very difficult to find one. I am so choosy. I always one the perfect job. I must find a job. Because staying at home is so boring. I did went to search for a job. I went to Royal Sporting House. They say they only looking for people after 15th June. I wanted to work at a petrol station but my mum never allow me. She say no good to breathe in all the gas. Almost fought with her.I must learn how to control myself. I get worked out very easily. I must overcome this barrier.  The only positive sign for me over the weekend was witnessing Arsenal complete an entire EPL season without a single defeat. WOAH! What an achievement? They also lifted the trophy. That was the most pleasing sight ever. I am proud to be a Gunner. Gunner forever.
