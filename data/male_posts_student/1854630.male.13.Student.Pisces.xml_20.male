I'm  urlLink profile 1854630  at Blogger. That means there are one million, eight hundred fifty-four thousand, six hundred twenty-nine other blogs being hosted by Google. Even if one million of those blogs aren't active, thats still alot of competition.  Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. There isn't any competition, just other people exchanging ideas, opening peekholes into their lives for the world to look through. Still, I want people to listen to what I have to say, whatever that is anyway.  And that's all I have to say about that.
