It all started off normal enough...we went over the Christmas thing we're having for the kids from the community centers in our area and our other projects.  But then it suddenly turned into an impeachment hearing - seriously, one woman in our group said how she didn't think the president of MB was pulling his weight (which probably is true), and suddenly we're in deliberations about how we're going to approach him about this.  It was crazy, especially since the Secretary (who is the one really running things right now) was asked to leave the room when we started talking about it, but came back in before the discussion was over.  I think the whole thing did a pretty heavy number on her (poor girl) - I don't think she necessarily wants to be Prez, and I also think that a lot of us (me included) were pretty worried about the way that the concern had been raised with the group before it had been raised with Brad (the Prez).  ANYWAY...so that was the interesting part of my night.  Aside from that, today was pretty normal EXCEPT that it was ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL outside!!!  Just one of those days that you wish it were like that every day...but alas, c'est la vie.  Oh, and as a totally miscellaneous side note, I saw an awesome car yesterday - it was a yellow Viper with purple ground lighting.  While I might have preferred blue or black with the purple ground lighting (or better yet, silver with blue ground lighting), it was still pretty cool ;)
