Finally, a respectable B. lol...well, sort of respectable. 82.6% lol..thats .2 points away from a B-. I'm good. I still argued over a few points though.  oh god. that girl to whom brighton said i wnated to kill and her friend are staring at me and giving me dirty looks. my god. this is scary.

A group of tenth grade girls sitting and staring at me. ahhh im scared. lol  umm...person just went on the comp next to me. but hes not looking. so im still oj. hes looking up 'splash waterfalls' by ludacris. alrighty.   in tech(last period...just ended) alex was looking at liz phair lyrics with me. wait. crap. that girl is back. in her locker....i hope she doesnt turn around. i swear. yeah, anyways... so alex suddenyl says loudly 'take my dress off' and alex l. turned around and looked at her. i mean, she was close to me, leaning over to the screen, so it seemed sort of....odd. lol  Hah, rudy and that girl are flirting. im gonna go now. but i have tow rite about something aisha said.   much love  peace   ~alex. ill also put a poem er quote then too. byeeeee
