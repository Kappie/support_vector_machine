Why did this battle need to take place. Life splits of thousands of times every minute. Like a giant family tree. You choose one line, and follow it until the inevitable death. How can I not wonder about the other lines..   These thoughts ran through his head. The thoughs...so light and wispy, much like the light fog entangling his feet, and his enemies' feet. Indicating the cool autumn evening temperature. Blocking an ant's vision of the sky. Just fog. Not nearly as dangerous as the blackened iron and steel forged for one purpose..To end the life of another. Of course, everyone already knows this, so reiterating the commen knowledge of the purpose of a sharp blade is off topic.  Despite the light air that floated around, and the breaths illuminated by the cold air striking the hot, there was a battle to be fought. Not just one battle, but two. Mental and physical. Neurons and metal. Twinge and snap. Victory was not only necessary, but...well, this was more important then the loss of a life. This was a loss of history. Another tick mark on the record book of the "greater being" oppressing the true hero. This struck a smile on his face.  Standing up, the mist parted for his feet as he placed himself on the ground. Leather covered his legs, and a light plate covered his torso. One thing left to do. Choose a path and sprint down it as fast as possible. The ground held strong as he glided across the scape, chasing shadows..  Silence insued. As he reached the treeline, the invisible enemy suddenly became visible. The path had been chosen, and the only part left was death.  -End.        The end, and the beginning. Sacrifice for someone else. Charging the foe and dieing, yet allowing someone else to live. Perhaps that person will go on to give birth to the next world leader, who will crush billions of people. Maybe someone died that day might have saved the life of the next savior. Maybe not. It's impossible to know. Impossible to think about. Impossible to care. Just remember, we are all connected. You do not have to understand this. Just acknowledge it, for the sake of everyone. Realize you are not the only life form that has feelings. Please. Take a second everyday and marvel at how many people you can pass on the street, or driving, that all have a destination and a purpose. And don't try to tell yourself you don't have a purpose. We all do. We are all connected. For what purpose would be greater then affecting hundreds of lives every day?
