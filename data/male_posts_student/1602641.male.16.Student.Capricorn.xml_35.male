First it was "Temptation Island": hardly the most original idea, but toying with the human psyche is what naturally comes to mind when thinking of reality TV. Then it was that show where several singles were anonymously matched and then challenged to stick it out in a relationship until the big day when they would be married and given one-million dollars. Then it was "The Littlest Groom" where Fox goes further into the exploration of human attraction by seeing who, out of a panel of aesthetically-pleasing women, would choose to date a dwarf. I found that one to be particularly offensive in a number of obvious ways. Then there was "Forever Eden", the show where singles are put in a "paradise", bound to go wrong of course! The only thing wrong with that one is that they would equate a reality TV show to something as sacred as The Bible.  But all of this is nothing compared to what they've done now. Now, further exploiting the science of sexual attraction, they are taking however many "Trailer-Trash" women and, through the miracle of plastic surgery, make them magically "beautiful". Then, pitting them in a "Battle-royale" of sorts with each other in a Miss America Beauty Pageant style competition. I can't even begin to describe what is wrong with this, and more so, cannot describe why it is any worse than the other reality TV shows on Fox.  Oh, and then there's "Joe Millionaire" and "Playing it Straight"...
