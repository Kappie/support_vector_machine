Mobile phones and SMS are the most comnvenient tools next to the computer and the internet. We get to reach our lost loved ones and friends through texting. If we wanted to ask something, it's one text message away. If we want to chat and dish out the darkest and the dirtiest "chismis" on anyone, then go reach out your phones... Our mobile phones and its mighty service can keep us updated with emergency situations. Plus, the service could cost you a buck, which means, you can be merrier! Also, for the prepaid subscribers, there are now called AutoLoad stations anywhere you go which makes reloading hassle-free when it comes to scratching cards or saviing money. And the price for reloading stars from 25 pesos up to 150 pesos.  Now going to the disadvantages...  As for mobile phones, people go for the style and the price. The more expensive the phone can get, the better. They don't even realize that they do buy a mobile phone because they want to get connected 24/7. And crime rates are getting higher because of phone snatching and robbery. I wonder, what if the snatcher or the robber got a 5110 or other lower models, would they return it to the victim and tell them, "Can you get a nice phone?!"  For the SMS, I would say that it can also do you harm, if you're the type of person who would go spread your number to the strangers. Beware... You might get killed. I remember an episode from a TV show where the victim gets killed by a simple text message. If you still can't get it, I'm talking about the "textmate" and "eyeball" thing. Or if you're the addicted one, you might get distracted with your studies (or work) because all you ever think is, "I'm waiting for that person to reply to my messge!" Wake up... You'd say, "Sana nag-expire na lang ang load ko" (for all the prepaid subscribers) or, "Sana di na lang ako nakipag-text sa kanya nang di tumaas ang bill ko" (for postpaid subscribers).
