I do have quite a bit going on in my life, but it can't be that, I'd be able to tell if it were that. I think it is due to the way I've been treating my best friend, Stephie. I haven't called her but once the whole break, and I hardly have time to talk to her. I just can't manage to do everything anymore. I know she should be the first priority I have, and she's not. I'm not really sure what is. Everyone around me seems to get more depressed as they progress in years. No one is happy anymore, and I can't do anything about it. It always causes me great mental anguish when others are feeling emotional pain, and I can't aid them. I feel very connected to all my friends, and when they feel sad, I feel twice as bad for them. This depression is killing me. I have to do something about it. There must be a way to at least make everyone a little happier, even for a few seconds. I would give anything to see that.
