As I hunkered down for Hurricane Isabel to put some smackdown on me (I live in the DC area, and we've been warned all week long of the impending apocalypse that was Isabel...what a gyp!   Nothing happened here.  After I spent the afternoon digging trenches in my backyard so my basement wouldn't flood, taped up the windows, put batteries in my flashlight and radio, set up candles within arm reach, stocked up on beer and smokes...nothing!   Tropical Storm  Isabel is nothing but a cocktease!  But I digress...on to the show!)  The show started out with a ton of hype for the Iron Man Match between Champ Kurt Angle and Challenger Brock Lesnar.  In the history of the WWE/F, there have only been two other Iron Man matches, HHH vs. The Rock a couple years ago, and Bret Hart vs. Shawn Micheals in their classic Wrestlemania encounter some years ago.  The announcers were also hyping the fact that this was only the third 1 on 1 match between Brock and Kurt (the other two being WM XIX, and a month ago at SummerSlam).  But before the "Match to End All Matches", there was a tag-team encounter between the Champs, Shelton Benjamin  Charlie Haas vs. Los Guereros (Eddie  Chavo).  For rookies, the World's Greatest tag team have been wrestling like seasoned veterans for the short time they've been around.  Tonight was no exception.  The match lasted roughly 25 minutes with complete non-stop action.  Both teams threw their hearts and souls into the match.  The Guereros won the belts at the end, but after the match, both teams got a standing ovation from the live audience.      Eddie is now the US Champion, and one-half of the Tag Team Champs.  I'd love to see an angle where he decides that he looks so good in gold that he challenges for the WWE Championship.  Triple-Crown Champion?  I could see it.  Eddie is  that damn good!   Anyway, up next was the Iron Man Match.  For those of you who have never seen an Iron Man match, here's the rules in a nutshell:  The match goes for 60 minutes.  Whoever has the most falls (pins, submissions, DQ's, or countouts) at the end of 60 minutes wins the match.  Micheal "barely smarter than Coach" Cole was handed a memo in the middle of the match saying that should it be tied at the end of 60 minutes, UPN would allow them to go into overtime.    Anyway, to start out the match, Brock played the heel coward, by jumping out of the ring and threatening to get counted out.  (This reminded me of Ric Flair's heyday as NWA Champ, pulling similar stuff.)  Angle won the first fall by DQ when Lesnar clocked him over the head with a chair in the middle of the ring.  Lesnar apparently knew what he was doing, because seconds later, he F-5'ed Kurt and got a fall.  Two minutes later, Lesnar went up 2-1 over Angle by using Kurt's own Ankle lock.    Next thing you know, the two are on the outside of the ring and Lesnar F-5's Angle on the steel ramp (HOLY SHIT!!  HOLY SHIT!!).  Lesnar rolled into the ring ahead of the ten count and went up 3-1 over the Champ.    After the commercial, there was some back and forth action, then Angle came out of nowhere to hit an Angle Slam and score a pin.  3-2 Lesnar.  Then comes a lot of reversals.  Angle goes for a German Suplex which gets countered into a possible F-5 which gets countered into a possible Angle-Slam which gets countered into a possible...you get the point...anyway, Angle manages to put on the Ankle-Lock, but Lesnar doesn't tap out.  After Brock gets up, he goes for the clothesline, but hits the ref.  Nothing like a ref bump at this point, especially when both are getting falls on eachother.  With the ref down, Brock nails Angle in the head with the belt, revives the ref, and gets the three count.  4-2 Brock.  The next Holy Shit moment came when Lesnar was outside the ring threatening to toss the stairs in when Angle does a baseball slide into them and bonks Brock in the face and he rolls in two successive back somersaults on the steel ramp (you had to see it, trust me...).  Then there's a commercial break, and when we come back, we are informed that Lesnar scored another pinfall on Angle from a superplex.  (Why in the Blue Hell on a  TAPED  show did they have to have a fall during a commercial?   anyway, Lesnar is up 5-2 on the Champ.  Would Kurt Angle be able to battle back?  After more awesome counter-wrestling on the outside of the ring and then inside, Lesnar counters an Angle-Slam attempt into a DDT, but Angle kicks out. Lesnar hits three release German Suplexes.  Angle got hold of Brock with a belly-to-belly and narrowed it to 5-3, Brock with less than 20 minutes to go.  After some more great counter-wrestling, Kurt managed to wrap on an Ankle lock and get Brock to tap once again.  5-4, just a couple minutes to go!  With just 20 seconds left, and Angle losing 5-4 with the promise of an overtime, he applies a hardcore Anklelock on Brock.  As the clock ticks down to it's final seconds...  Brock doesn't tap out.  It's over and Brock Lesnar is once again WWE Champion.  What a night!  And for free!  I've been a wrestling fan for 20 years, give or take, and I have never seen matches like this given away for free on TV like tonight.  This year alone, I estimate that I have spent roughly 250 bucks on PPV's and haven't gotten this quality of wrestling.    After tonight, I highly doubt I'll be getting Unforgiven this Sunday.  I may wait until the next Smackdown! PPV, or even wait for Survivor Series in November.
