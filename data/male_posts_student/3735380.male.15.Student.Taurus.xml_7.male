What are they expecting? Some long laugh? A friend? A punch in the face?  I'd punch the face if I wasn't on duty. But this guy came up to the counter and made a really offensive comment to the company.  The thing that ticks me off the most is that he did it knowing he couldn't get hurt.  What's his problem? How come he doesn't have any friends to tell this to instead?  McDonald's doesn't serve crappy food. I've told many friends this. I even explained that we have a ton of food safety awards. Yet some people are idiotic enough to watch the news and not look on the positive side of things.  You wanna know what that makes those customers?  Cowards with money.
