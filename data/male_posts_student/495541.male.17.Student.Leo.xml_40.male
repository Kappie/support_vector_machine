The one major thing is that I have to convert all my old stuff over to this new layout.  Everytime I create a new layout I'm always wondering if I'm wasting my time and am going to trash the new layout in a month.  Time will tell I guess.  Other than that not much is going on in the halbe.org world.  I really have nothing planned for the new halbe.org.  I remember I had a plan text file somewhere and had a bunch of cool ideas but I doubt I could ever get the time to manage all that stuff.  I really don't have the knowledge to do all the stuff I want.  I'm not saying I never will do some of the stuff I wanted, just not now.  That's pretty much it for now.
