I seriously hope it's just a temporary period that will ease away soon. This is the sort of emotions that will drag u to rock bottom and feeling the pits. I am stuck with one of the tutorial question and i began to ask myself, "can i do make it through?", " You are working hard but are u working smart?" i feel as tho i m not studying the correct, proper way. This is so ironic. Oh well, i should be more positive rather than being pessimistic about the whole issue. It's not the end of the world eh. I am keeping my fingers crossed big time.
