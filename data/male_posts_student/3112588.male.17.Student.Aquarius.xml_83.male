LoL! isnt that just soooo great? like i dont hear it everyday anywayz, ya know? oh well...my uncle julio totally stood up for me, and he's even gonna try and get me a job hookup at our GAP out here in stoneridge! sick, huh? i cant wait--i hope i get the job! so yeah...but i had to clean some stuff up after dinner, then my mom, my aunt, my uncle and myself are all sitting in the living room--everyone else was completely scattered all over the house, so it was just the usual 4 of us. my mom made some remark about me being insecure, and my uncle straight out asked me: so noah..what are your insecurities? LoL i was like: whoa.....so, needless to say, we spent the next hour and half comparing our lives and all that great stuff. its like, this is the SECOND person that has had the same exact problems as me, the same exact insecurities as me...the only difference is, he's 37 years old, and he's fixed all those things. sure, everyone still has insecurities, but like--he's still just a teen inside (and he looks so young too!). but we talked for a long time, and it was nice to get advice from someone who has OVERCOME these troubling issues. he wouldnt let me make excuses for myself..and although i kept saying that ppl hurt me a lot, he finally just flat out told me THAT IS MY FAULT! im letting ppl walk all over me, and he's right! why am i like this now? i was never like this before, right? well, i guess i was, and we just examined our lives together. he told me that i need to be OK with myself, regardless of whether or not my parents like who i am or what i do. he did say that i still need to respect them, but to approach them in love, and tell them that this is MY life, and im going to do w/e i want...and, ask for their support in w/e i choose to do with my life. for the past 2 days, all my dad has been talking about is me going to college, and making a plan for my life! like, ive got a whole other year before i leave for school--if i do--but he wants me to plan now, which i think is smart. he wants me to be successful and rich and famous...but who doesnt want that for their kid, right? they mean well, but sometimes my dad tries to live his life through me, and that cant happen. he knows he cant do that, but he continues to try anywayz, and he puts a wedge between us, that i dont want to be there...so, by the end of the summer (more like the end of the month), i have to tell him what i want to do with my life, the colleges i would like to apply to, and see what he says. my parents are willing to support me in w/e i do, and money is no object when it comes to college. i mean, this is my life, afterall! so, by august 25th, if you ask me what i want to do with my life, i'll know for sure--no doubts here guys. im scared, but the Lord will use me wherever i go...even if it means not going to college right away. i dont think my dad would be ok with that, but i dont know...he knows i love to travel, and after watching "The Perfect Score", i realized that i dont have to be the best all the time. the overachiever (Erika Christensen)--all she wanted was to travel all over Europe for a year--and thats what I WANT! but...i dont know what my parents will say. after all, it will be there money you know. and i dont want to dissapoint them. maybe i need a year to clear my head, find who i am, and all that jazz...ive started trying to find out myself, who i am, and what i want this summer, and i know its going to be hard--none of this finding out overnight crap. anywayz, i better get the directions to Koinonia. im going up there with tim today to visit everyone, meet the new peeps, and see fireworks in Scotts Valley with my friends from Summer Staff. pray that we stay safe, b/c there are a lot of drunk drivers on the roads on 4th of july. but, at least i know where im going..praise the Lord! anywayz, happy 4th everyone! love you all byebye
