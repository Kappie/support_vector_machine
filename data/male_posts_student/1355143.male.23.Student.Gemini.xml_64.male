It's not because the chinese decided to loosen up the censorship policy, or some hacker friend of mine managed to trick the system, but because I was forced to leave the country. After teaching 3 months on a tourism visa (my employer prefered to have it that way..), China no longer wanted to have me as a "tourist", so I was asked to leave China within 48 hours. So I did. After a big fight with the university whose fault this really was (obviously theirs), they agreed to cover all my expenses to go to Hong Kong.  So now I'm in Hong Kong trying to get the work permittance I should have gotten in the first place. But no reason not to combine business and pleasure, so I'll stay here a couple of days more. I'm heading back to China for the 1.May celebrations, which obviously is a big thing in communist China.  I put together a travel diary on the net where you can see some photos of my China life. There are also some stories in the diary there, but I'll guess you guys need to brush up your norwegian to be able to understand. Ulli and Svana might be able, though. We did share a common language some thousand years ago before we sent all our countries lunatics to the island in the west=) Anyway, the adress is:   http://www.resdagboken.se/travel.asp?id=9474=eng  Cheers guys. To Adam and the rest in back in Barcelona. FC Barca's success has not passed unseen in China. Cheer on our lads so they reach next seasons Champions League. A norwegian newspaper delivered a story about a possible deal Owen-Kluivert. Any truth in it?   Veg
