Whether it’ll stay clicked or just be a one-night thing, I don’t know, but here’ hoping it lasts.  A little background.  The whole time I’ve been up here I’ve been really struggling with how to be a Christian in this kind of environment (i.e. very secular, with little or no proximate support).  I’ll be the first to say that things have slipped a little (which isn’t really saying much considering what I was like before I came here).  But it’s been a real struggle – how do you live Christianity when you’re surrounded by relativism (even if it doesn’t go by that name)?  And even harder, how to you speak Christianity when it’s not something anyone wants to hear (in fact, when it’s usually something ridiculed).  And how do you do that when you’re already an outsider?  I know a lot of people will probably say that I need to get locked into a local church or something, but I have to admit that my experience with the Church has been really mixed.  I’ve never really found anyone who was willing to “mentor” me or anything, and I’ve had only marginally more success actually having someone express an interest in my life (nevermind my spiritual condition or anything like that).  So I haven’t really made a whole lot of an effort to find a church around here – I’m definitely going to put more effort into it next week, but as you can probably ascertain, I’m not too hopeful in finding anything meaningful.  Sure, it will be nice to be around a lot of other people that purport to believe the same way I do, but I’ve become so disillusioned by the number of people who claim to be Christian but don’t act like it, who don’t have the passion or fire for it that I’m looking for and can look up to, that I can try to emulate.  I don’t know what it is about me, whether it’s the fact that I’ve never really had a lot of close friends (outside of my family) or that it takes me forever (years) to get to know people and feel comfortable around them, or whether I just don’t know how to be proactive in getting to know people, but I’m always a loner.  A bunch of times while I’ve been down here I’ve turned down opportunities to go out and doing things with other people in our group; I think that a lot of the time it’s because I feel like I’m not very good with people and that I’m so old-fashioned, I’ll just hold everyone back and make them not like me even more.  And a lot of the time it’s also because I know that they’re probably going to be doing or talking about things that I disagree with, and I’ve always tried to keep myself out of those kinds of situations – but maybe that isn’t such a good idea right now, maybe that’s something I need to change.  One can imagine that all of these problems and thoughts have been compounded by the nature of my internship (i.e. I have to go represent a lot of people that I really disagree with).  But at the same time it’s also given me some hope that I’m finally doing something because I think it’s the right thing to do – there people are the ones that are the most put down, the ones that everyone overlooks, and they are exactly the ones that I want to help the most.  I’m not kidding when I say this is what I want to do, not just as a short-term thing to “get it out of my system,” but as something that it an integral part of my life.  Maybe it won’t be defense work, but I know that it is something I’m going to be involved with in some way.  Anyway, all of this being said, I actually went out and did some things with people tonight; one of the girls’ rooms was having dinner for everyone (the girl cooking was Indian, so it was Indian food, and I thought it was pretty good – spicy, but good J), so I roused myself off the couch and went down with the other guys (with trepidation, I might add, but everything was cool once I got there).  So that was cool – maybe this was the first step towards breaking down some of the walls I’ve created around myself and actually coming out of my shell a little.  But we’ll see about that one – I’ve been saying I needed to do that for a long time now.  Part of the things about today was the fact that we finished our training for the internship, and one of the things I’ve realized is that I’m going to have to change my personality a little bit if I’m going to do a good job at this internship.  We were doing an exercise today where I was supposed to give someone a hard time and I JUST COULDN’T DO IT; being assertive and/or confrontational is something I have a really hard time with.  But I’m going to have to become more like that with this internship; the stakes are too high for me to just give up on things and avoid confrontations (depending on the cases I’m working with, our client could lose years of their life in jail).  And surprisingly, I think I can actually do this – I’ve found myself “conforming to the role” a little during training, and I know that things are going to become much more real to me when we start tomorrow.  But I think that the biggest thing that happened tonight was something small, something I haven’t had happen in a long time and something I’ve been missing for so long – I noticed the stars.  I was walking home from working out tonight and I actually had a sense of awe looking up at them.  Maybe this is all really weird for anyone else reading this, but I’ve always drawn a sense of comfort from nature, and especially the stars.  It’s something about knowing that those beautiful specks of light are actually hundreds of times larger than anything we can comprehend and millions of miles away and yet their light reaches all the way to this planet, to this hemisphere, to this country, to this region, and ultimately to where I’m standing – and that they’ve been doing this for as long as humanity has existed.  There’s something about the combination of the eternality and temporal nature of it that is just awe-inspiritng and gives me such a sense of comfort knowing that if God took the time to place them in their perfect orders, then he undoubtedly has the ability to work in my life and change things for the better.  If only I could somehow bypass this whole free-will thing…  Anyway, I don’t remember who said it, but one of the quotes I have is “The world will perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder.”  I totally agree – and I love this feeling of being in awe, of knowing that everything will be ok because someone is looking out for me, that somehow things will work out.  If only I could stay this serene…
