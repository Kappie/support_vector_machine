You see, Evan and I were at the local coffee shop sipping our cappucinos when a guy wearing a scarf rollerbladed by and quickly said, "If you glue your balls to the carpet you turn into a cantaloupe!"  So I did.  Evan and I discussed which type of glue would work best, and I decided on rubber cement.  I quickly rubber cemented my genitalia to the carpet and BAM! I was a cantaloupe.  Just like that.  It was crazy!  Now that I'm a cantaloupe I have so many career choices...like...Cantaloupe!  Yeah!  That's what I'll do!  I'll be a cantaloupe, and I'll be a cantaloupe.  Think of how much money I'll make...I can't wait.  Thanks evan, I owe you a  brass monkey .
