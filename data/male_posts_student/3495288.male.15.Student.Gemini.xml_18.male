Today is the day when i meet Daniel. From the time i woke up, i have waited for Daniel's call. I know he can't call me in the morning because he has to go to Church. So i waited for him. Till late noon. The clocked striked 3 when i had to go. Well Ash and Roy has scheduled to meet me at Orchard Mrt around 3:45pmto go to the concert at the Botanical Garden. When i was about to go, Rashid came to my house and saw me getting ready to go out. Well sadly Rashid  FORCED  me to go to his house because he wants to tag along. Well he took a really long time to get ready. I got pissed off with him so i just waited, looking at the clock's minute hand pass by every minute mark.Once he was ready, we straight took a bus towards Admiralty MRT station.   I smsed Ash saying that i would be late. When i was in Khatib he smsed me asking where i was,  "I am in Khatib."  i replied his msg,  "WHAT!? ok."  a unsuspected reply from him. Well from that i know he was sorta angry at me. They have already reached there. Once we arrived at our destination, i gave a call to Ash saying that i have already reached the station. He asked me to wait for him at the control station. We saw them once we got out of those machines that wishes to crush people's waist. I saw Ash with this attitude which i seem not to like. I came up to him and apologised a lot of times. While up on the escalator he turned to Roy, seems like he was ignoring my apology, telling him that he wanted to go to the toilet. So off they went to that toilet.I got  HURT  when he ignored my apology and showing me that attitude. Rashid asked for my cellphone as he wanted to call his mom. I passed it to him. I was still hurt inside so i decided to go up the first escalator to see if it is crowded. Well i waited for them at the top.  Hurt inside, I decided to walk all alone. Away from them. Don't want to be hurt again with that bitchy attitude. It was like Roy's bitchy attitude from last night had infected Ash. For the whole journey i kept quiet, not look at his face and walked as fast as i can. Rashid asked me to wait for them but i just ignored his words. I walked really fast. When i entered the botanical garden, everything was way different. The short cut to the location was blocked so i had to walk the long way. Rashid shouted at me asking me if i knew where i was going so i just pointed the direction to the place.  Once near the place i could hear the band playing Mission Impossible than Pirates of the Carribian. Once at that place i smsed Dan asking where was he. (ok skip this part)....from the hills above listening the ACS(I) playing ITS A SMALL AFTER ALL i went down and walked pass Ash and Roy.I dare not look at their faces as i don't want to see that attitude. I sat on the bench hoping that Ash would come up the stairs and talk to me but it didn't happen. People from all sorts of background and age sat beside me. I got tired so i went for a walk. I walked around up the hill down the hill, in and out of the bushes. Suddenly i received an SMS from Dan saying that Ash and Roy are leaving. Sadly he does not know where the duo were heading. I saw them walking out of the second entrance like happily. Seeing Ash waving his arms in the air and Roy shaking his head like a pair of baby rattle. I smsed Ash asking where they were heading twice. He did not reply to my msg so i decided to follow them from behind. Till the path leads to the main road. Roy called for a Taxi and both went in. I just stood there. Feeling more  HURT, DISAPPOINTED, CRUSHED, SAD, DEPRESSED.  How can he do this, Just left like that. I walked towards the main road looking the back of the taxi. Stood there soulessly. A tear from myright eye slide down my cheeks.  I went and sms Rashid saying that i had to go already. I walked slowly from the Botanical Garden till Orchard MRT station. During the whole journey Rashid have been calling me and asking me whats wrong. And during the whole journey Ash and I have been argueing really badly. This time its worst.    -"where are you going?" "Um, Home.." -"Y?" "Tired. Don't worry, we'll be fine..." (do you think i wont worry? do you that i will be fine too?)   ..haiz.. well let me remember what i said after that... *this is a summarised what i said after this dialoge. -'Oh i c, Well since yesterday's concert was boring for both of you. Its not worth the money...a waste of money... In addition i am grounded because of i did not pay back my mom's money." "Oh shoot! The money for the concert!"   -"Never mind lah no need to pay me..." "NO! We need to pay you!" -"No need." "Why?!"   -"We won't be meeting again mah...* can't remember after that..." "Well, I forgave you already, but you kept running from me..." -"Because you were showing an attitude. Ignored my apology when i said it just now. You did not enjoy last night's concert... blah blah * can't remember again." "...I have nothing to say. But i wished you had told me what was wrong, rather than now..." (well i was waiting for you up there hoping that you would talk to me. But since you showed me an attitude and ignored me... most likely NOT.) -"Haiz..blah blah.. I think what Rashid was right. You two have doing things behind my back. Whatever it is i don't wanna know" "What the hell, i am not doing anything with roy!" - I did not reply after that... crying while walking. "I don't know what the hell Ra-ra told you, but i am definitely not with roy, If i am, may lightning strike me to hell.-continue from the next sms of ASH- what ever it is, forget about the FUCKING things i did for you, the stupid way i loved you and idiotic wai i broke so many so called rules in your life." (why would lightning strike you to hell. You don't even know whats hell like. You don't have a religion. Let LIGHTNING STRIKE ON ME! COZ THERE IS HELL IN MY LIFE AND RELIGION. LET ME DIE! LET MY SOUL BURN IN HELL! and FINE! FORGET ABOUT IT! Btw ASH if you are reading this.. Those cute sounds that you always make... ITS NOT CUTE!)    I dare not reply his sms as i wish not to hurt him no more and not to kill my self by being runnedover by a car. Thanks to this japanese teenager guy in black he saved me from that car. Not exactly my fault the light was still green man. He asked me whats wrong, but i did not answer, so he just only gave me a packet of tissue paper and walked me to the station. Everyone was staring at me in the station. Everyone was staring at me in the TRAIN. I stood and still crying abitthe whole journey back home. I walked home all alone. Feeling lost.Then i saw my sister going somewhere, i waved at her... than shecalled mejust to borrow myezlink card. When i got home i straight went into my room. And now iam sitting here... crying... doing my homework...waiting.  The END.  Well Daniel...can you just say that you  DON'T WANT TO GOTO THE CONCERT.  I waited for you call for a long time.btw your mom is quiet friendly though.Haiz... well till here.. Bye.   And yeah Its confirm that the relationship between Me and Ash is over. Its OVER! OVER! AH! He is now gone from my life... I am gone from his life. But i know either one of us will start crying back for more.
