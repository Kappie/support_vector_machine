Oh well. No biggy. So I called around to a few people and got nothing. I called Jonathan knowing he was out w/ his rents but you never know. He was still w/ them but could possibly do something later. Then out of the blue Jessica calls. YAY! Her and Jeremy wanted to hang out. There is not much to do in Mooresville or Monrovia so we head downtown. I asked Jeremy to drop me off @ home so I can drive. I had to be home by 12:30 and I didn't want to rely on them to have to take me home. So we get downtown and head over to the Abby. I love that place. I saw so many friends there tonight and met a new one for the first time. His name is Josh. He's pretty kewl. He came w/ this guy Bryan who knew Jeremy. We talked for a while and I was trying to flirt w/ him. He knew it too. The awesome thing was he was doing it back. Example: Jessica got up and wanted to move chairs. Josh was like take Andrew's seat. We'll share one. I was like YAY! lol When she said no, he skooted his chair closer to mine and put his leg up against mine. HOT! HOT! HOT! It was about time for me to go so Jessica got up and was going to walk me to my car. Josh and Bryan got up too. I guess they were leaving also. So we all walked out and headed to the cars. Jessica looks @ me and says. He thinks your cute! I was like, huh? I am not used to being the one hit on. It was really nice though. I kinda liked it. lol Jessica runs to Josh, gets his # and he tells her to give it to me. SCORE! That sounds bad but I mean it in a good way. Promise! I am really excited to give him a call here in a few days. Mabye tomorrow? Who knows.
