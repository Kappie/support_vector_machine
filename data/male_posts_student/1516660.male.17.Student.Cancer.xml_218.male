And I skipped question 7, because I spent too much time on question 6. I sdidn't really skip la. I tried to do 7 last...I knew the question So easy. I managed to complete the first 2 questions of 7 only...wasted sia. How meowful!  Hmm...after that, I stayed back to get my O Level papers. Meow meow! It was a mad rush of paper grabbing, but somehow, (thank my lucky stars meow meow) I got my papers back! I even managed to get Siva's. Gonna give it back to her! Meow!!   After that leh, a whole big bunch of us went to shop for prezzies. For SL and Ji lor. First, Ji went with us to buy SL's present. Meow meow! After much arguments and opinions (and invitations to one's home to play games), we finally decided on Jenja (the building blocks). Now, we must get rid of CQ. And got rid of him we did. Hmm...you know...I originally wanted to buy some something special for CQ alone one...but due to the lack of monetary funds, I have to share. Meow meow! In the end, we brought him a ***** (cannot reveal...later he read how?! Will revel the ans on sat!). I am passing it to him on Sat, along with a cake, I think. Meow!  Woah!! I can't wait for Makin Magic! And Superstar!! Oh my god! Popular has a lot of stocks you know! But I am so afraid they will get sold out! I want them!! Ohh!! Makin Magic!!! I want you!  Meow meow! Coming back home, I went online, played some Sims and watched the news. Oh! Our school was featured in both the Channel 8 and U news! The Channel 8 reported a talk by secondary schools to prepare primary school kids seondary school life. Miss Govind was seen giving a talk to the Northland Primary kids. In the Channel U news, a crane fell at our Rioverside construction site, injuring and killing an Indian man respectively. Meow meow! My codolences.   After that, watched TV lor. Yay! I finally planned CQ's party! Meow!! That shy little duck! Too embarrassed to celebrate in his house! In the end, have to celebrate at Wendy's house lor. Ha! I always feel guilty, becuase I invite people to her house without consulting her first. I am afraid she will be pissed off ma, but she said no. And she's bathing Lassie, so she can be clean for the Low cats to play with. Meow!! Gonna be fun, yeah!   Hmm...I gotta end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
