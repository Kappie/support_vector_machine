I was proven wrong ^^ we left at like 2 =P not that it mattered that much, it was enjoyable at keanes ^^ thx for da hospitality!! ooo.. and thx to kevin and his mom for driving us there!! ooo... and thx to renae for  her  hospitality!!    *cough* getting kinda off-track here.. um.. oh yah. met jeffrey and jeffrey there... probably forget who they are until next time I see them ^^;; Afterwards, when we reached the place, they played smash bros for awhile then went on a scavenger hunt thingy where jeff won. Then we went and kinda had a water balloon fight which quickly turned into an all-out water war where everyone (except me *cough* =P.. oh, and jeff) got really wet.    Oh wait... in between that, there was lunch and a movie.. we watched like the beginning of ringgu and then switched to phone booth... they were enjoyable ^^ anyhow.. afterward, we had dinner and did a little truth dare then i left. so yah.. what happened afterwards is a mystery =P   Dunno why i'm writing this as most people who read this blog already know all this... i guess jus for keeping in da archives so i can use it later to store in my diary ^^   ~Chronos
