Rules for twenty questions:           * Rule #1: Questioner may only ask questions that can be answered with a yes or a no.                      * Rule #2: Answerer may only respond with a yes or a no, whichever will be more helpful to A.  Rule #2 above is a good one -- the official one, but it's impossible to follow all the time.  Here are two exceptional acceptable answers that A (and Q) should keep in mind:      --"I DON'T KNOW."  Sometimes A simply will not know the answer, even though if he knew it he could answer yes or no.   In such cases A may respond with "I don't know."  As an example, consider that A has chosen the Rock of Gibraltar as the target and Q asks, "Is it closer to London than is Svalbard?"  If A doesn't know then he should not merely guess, because Q might know, and if A guesses wrong he will certainly mislead Q, which is a more serious violation of Rule #2.  So, A should say he doesn't know and let Q take it from there.      --"I CAN'T ANSWER."  Sometimes A will properly determine that he's unable to answer a particular question with a definitive yes or a no, even though he is not ignorant of any facts as in the example above.  In such cases he may respond with the generic phrase "I can't answer."  An example will clarify the intent of this guideline:  If the target is a golf ball and the question is "Is it bigger than a golf ball?" then A will almost certainly mislead Q whether he answers yes or he answers no, which is a more serious violation of Rule #2.  Therefore he may simply state that he can't answer.  It's then up to Q to figure out what that means.  (Also note that if A had been a real stickler he may have legitimately answered No to that question, because a golf ball is not, strictly speaking, I suppose, bigger than a golf ball, the implication being that Q should have asked, "Is it bigger than or equal to the size of a golf ball?")  At first it might seem that any question that leads to either of these answers must be worthless, but the opposite might be true.  Whenever A says he doesn't know or can't answer, Q should examine the exact way he phrased the question to determine whether a subtle change in that phrasing will elicit a Yes or No response, which might reveal a lot about the target.   Traditionally, Q's first question (the only one Q may ask that does not allow for a Yes or No answer) is always the same: "Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?"  Indeed, in certain parts of the world this game is known as "Animal, Vegetable, Mineral."  The two important points above are that      * all legitimate targets will fall into one of these three categories or a combination thereof, and     * A must choose a legitimate target.  One kind of illegitimate target is an object whose very existence is in question, such as Martians or the Loch Ness monster, because A will be forced to answer Q's yes-or-no questions based on mere belief rather than factual knowledge that can certainly be shared.  Another example of an illegitimate target is something that has no physical existence such as patriotism or haste.  It's sometimes difficult for A to decide whether to respond with "animal," "vegetable," or "mineral," so here are some examples and other thoughts that might provide some help to both A and Q.  To begin with, anything that's never been alive is mineral, and everything else must therefore be either animal or vegetable (unless you count microscopic entities such as bacteria and viruses, which you should).  Here are three examples:      * If you've chosen as your target the clock inside London's Big Ben, you should answer, "Mineral," because the clock parts are made of steel and brass and copper and so on, which are minerals.     * If you've chosen as your target the wool sweater you're wearing, you should say, "Animal," because it's made of wool, which comes from sheep, which am animals.     * And if you've chosen the T-shirt that your date is wearing, you should say, "Vegetable," because it's made of cotton, which is a plant.  TARGETS MADE OF PLASTIC.  Targets made of plastic (floppy disks and trash bags) and other such petroleum-based products (nylon and gasoline) are impossible to classify as animal or vegetable because it is still uncertain in the scientific community whether petroleum comes from dead animals or dead plants (although the most recent evidence I know of, circa 1990, suggests it's both).   Therefore, by arbitrary convention, if your target is made from petroleum products you should say, "Vegetable," and as long as Q is aware of this convention, it is then his responsibility to think of asking, "Is it made of plastic?" or some such question.  For that matter, even if Q doesn't know this convention, it's still up to him to pursue the "plastic" question.  TARGETS MADE OF MORE THAN ONE SUBSTANCE.  Often A will choose a target that's made of, say, both vegetable and mineral -- for example, a pencil, which is made of wood and an eraser and paint (vegetables) as well as graphite and a metal ferrule (minerals).  In this case, A might say "Vegetable" because a pencil is more vegetable than mineral, although if he said, "I can't answer" that would be OK too.  As another example, if A's target is a floppy disk, then he should probably say "Vegetable," (plastic) despite the fact that a minuscule but fundamental portion of the total mass of the target is actually iron oxide (rust), a mineral.  In any case, A may declare only one of the three possible substances, so no matter what A declares it's up to Q, if he wants to, to determine more precisely what substance A's target is made of.  For the novice who didn't read all the paragraphs above, it's important to understand that when A says, say, "Vegetable," that doesn't necessarily mean that the target is a vegetable such as a carrot.  Similarly, the answer "Animal" doesn't necessarily mean that the target is an animal such as a platypus.  And, of course, the answer "Mineral" doesn't necessarily mean that the target is a lump of iron.  The question "Animal, vegetable or mineral?," as seasoned 20 Questions players know, asks about the primary substance of which the target is made, and every legitimate target, i.e., every possible object or substance in the universe, will be made entirely of animal, vegetable or mineral or any of the four combinations thereof.
