"My alarm clock lost power and then I got a cold..."  Yeah, right. I was up at 6:30am. I had switched 'shifts' with Robert so I could head out to the lake earlier - that meant I had to be up at the office at 7:30am. No problem. I'd rather be up anyways.  My morning went really well, slow, but nothing annoying or worth causing a fuss about. I had an email problem in the Alabama office that I was 'brainstorming' over. I kept it in the back of my mind, something I do alot at the office.  Soon enought it was around that time to head to the gym, strap on some weight gloves and push some iron. Good times but not on this Thursday.  Right off the bat, I saw the foreshadowing of something bad. As I was walking down the hall, this fat, rolled-over, dick of a man named Taylor is standing in the hall looking for his 'mail.' He has been coming to the gym for about two weeks and just really gets tooled around by his co-workers. He seems to do whatever ridiculous exercise they throw at him - what a pushover. As I walked down the hall, he looked up at me and then back at his mailbox by the mailroom. I start to walk around him and he steps right in my way, without even aying excuse me or anything. It was totally an obvious move to piss me off.  I just mumbled "JACK ASS" under my breath. Another weak move by me. I shoulda just laid the guy out right there - but I let it slide right off my back like everything else.  The workout was going pretty smooth, I noticed 'jackass' had made his way over to the tredmill to do a little mall walking. We had some Oldies radio on the stereo and James, Robert, and myself were working those shoulders hard.  Up pops Talors buddy, Brian (this guy talks bad about his wife and says beer at least once a day in the gym.)  He starts changing the radio station, while at the same time asking James if he doesn't mind.  James says "Yeah, I like that station." Brain: "I can't workout to that" still changing the station  "Is this alright" Brian says as he gets closer to the station of his choosing. James: "I don't give a fuck......pause.......but if I come in here tomorrow and you change the station when I asked you not to, I'm gonna have to fight your fucking ass over it. That's bullshit!"  BAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The little bitch but it back on the Oldies and went back to his tredmill. All I heard was "Fuck" and "Shit." HAHA they were pissed.   Now I hate going into that gym. It was embarrassing to see that totally lack of restrain on negative emotions. I understand James was pissed, and he had a right to be upset. It was just a bad vibe, especially with customers.  Anyways, James was hot for the rest of the day at work. 4pm rolled around and I was out of there. I picked up mimi and we headed out to Lake Grapevine to meet up with James and do some water skiing. I had a blast. Ryan, James oldest son was with us for about 2 hours. I finally got up on the water and actually skiied. Fuck yeah, that was a relief for the Thursday from hell.   I ended up forgetting about dinner and by the time I got home, I was so tired and hungry we headed over to IHOP for a gourmet meal. ha.  Today was pretty chill. There were some adverse effects of James actions in the weight room. The owner of my consulting firm sent out an email to all of MIS about proper etiquette in the gym. haha. James was pissed - time to look for another job he says.  I packed and stuffed and folded everything for the 7" comp. That is coming to an end.   Looks like mimi didn't get that job, havn't heard anything from the folks in cali - guess we'll just have to keep looking. As for me, I havn't had one solid lead.  I bought the Karate Double LP - that has to be my favorite record. Damn Palmer took my CD to Denver with him! FUCK  goodnight  p.s. - arcade auction - Sat morning at the Rodeo center in Mesquite - I will be there at 8am to play some free games.   current mood:  tired current music: Karate
