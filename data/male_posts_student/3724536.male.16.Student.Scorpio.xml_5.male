Luckily i made it before the second bell so i didnt hve my name taken down in the book or tht would hve been my 11th time late i think.. That must hve been the only good thing tht happened to me all day, the rest of it was just crap.  First 2 periods was pjk. Only 4 of us actually practiced passing the frissbee, the rest were all playing football. Imagine having a match after school and only 4 out of 10 ppl actually bothered to practice. Made the mistake of not taking a spare t-shirt to wear, so had no choice but to wear back the same dirtyand muddy t-shirt for the match later tht day. Thankfully it managed to dry somewhat before school ended.. but more on that later, for now, lets talk about the next 3 periods.  By the time i managed to clean off all the grime and dirt off myself, i had already missed 1 period so i had to go straight to the dewan kuliah for a lecture on retailing and IT or somethin lidat... Well when i got there i was sweating like a pig so i only wanted to enjoy the cool air the aircon was blowing out and didnt really care what the guy was crapping about anyway... I learnt a valuable lesson though - nvr sit near others who are making lots of noise, even if its 1 or 2 benches behind. Somehow teachers will group u in together with them and blame the whole lot for disturbing the peace. Thats what happened to me and my friends and we ended up being scolded along with the others. The best part came when the teacher was giving out fliers advertising the course.. we wanted to take some but she wouldnt give it to us coz she said we were part of those making noise. When we argued we were from a different class and sitting behind, i think her exact reply was "i dont care, just shut up." haha tht was pretty funny since she was directing it at szeyen. =D It wasnt very funny later when she made us the last to walk out of the dewan... she actually threatened us to argue with her whether we should be let out sooner.. luckily none ofus took up the challenge or that would hve probably been the end for whoever....  After recess we continued normal class. Everyone was still debating whether they were gona stay for the match or not. It didnt help matters when the general idea was 'if he stays i stay'. Well at the end of the day practically everyone stayed so it wasnt so bad after all. As for the match itself.. well it didnt go very well. Lost to s2 1-0 and tht was with 1 point disallowed for us. Damn should have argued more with the linesman. How can he say its out when the referee says its in??? Ah well i guess whats done is done. at least they got beaten 3-0 by p2 in the next match..hehehe....  After the game we were all feeling pretty down and scolding each other but thats just normal of us i suppose. Ken as usual wasnt satisfied and wanted to go down and play summore. szeyen wasnt happy with tht since he wanted to go home but ended up staying until 4 oclock till he couldnt wait any longer and just went home by himself..haha... as for myself.. halfway through playing i suddenly pulled not one, but both my calve muscles. DAMN tht hurts bad. Took a loong time before i could hobble back to the canteen. took an even longer time to hobble my way out of school to wait for my mum to pick me up. Even worse was Dominic couldnt find his wallet when he came back after his match. Came back happy his class was in finals and went home sad his wallet was stolen...tht helps to make me feel not so bad about myself..=D  The drama doesnt end there though. When my mum picked me up she said she hadnt been able to find her handbag the whole day. Luckily i remembered that it had dropped into the backseat of my dads car when she sent me to school in the morning. Thankfully dad hadnt set off for JB yet or my mum would hve been stuck without all her stuff for 3 whole days!! So after picking me up we drove all the way to subang parade just to get the handbag back and then drive all the way home again.. sighh the more i think about it the more depressing it feels..lolz  So to summarize one of the worst days of the year :- - came to school late - got scolded unfairly by teacher - didnt take spare clothes to wear  - lost frissbee match to s2 1-0 - pulled muscle while practicing - dom lost his wallet - mum almost lost handbag - death happened to neighbour across the street(ok i know this sounds pretty irrelevent but still... :p)
