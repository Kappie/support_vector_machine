That way, if anybody says, "Hey can you give me a hand?" you can say, "Sorry, got these sacks."    Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine which is probably why most of us died of tuberculosis.    If your friend is already dead, and being eaten by vultures, do you think it would be okay to feed some bits of your friend to one of the vultures? To teach him some tricks? But only if you're serious about adopting the vulture.    Broken promises don't upset me, I just think, why did they believe me?    I hope that after I die, people will say of me: "That guy sure owed me a lot of money".     You know what would make a good story? Something about a clown that makes people happy, but inside, he's real sad. Also, he has sever diarrhea.    If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to say is, "God is crying". If the kid asks why, a cute answer would be, "Probably because of something you did".    Here's a good trick: Get a job as a judge at the Olympics. Then, if some guy sets a world record, pretend that you didn't see it and go, "Okay, is everybody ready to start now?"    If you saw two guys named Hambone and Flippy, which one would you think liked dolphins the most? I'd say Flippy, wouldn't you? You'd be wrong, though, it's Hambone.    When you go in for a job interview, I think a good idea is to ask them if they ever press charges.    I think the mistake a lot of us make is thinking the state-appointed shrink is our friend.    If Alien was my friend, I'd like to be with him when he went to the dentist. When they started drilling, he'd probably go nuts and start eating everybody. That Alien!    "Of all the imaginary friends I've had, I don't think there was one that I didn't end up having to kill."
