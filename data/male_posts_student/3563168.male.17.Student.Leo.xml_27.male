His name is General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Oh man, I'm sure that guy could kick anyone's ass in a war. He's so damn crunk.    Maybe most of you think that I've lost my mind right about now. Those people just don't want to admit that Ike kicks ass.  I mean, he's a military genius, what more do you people want in somebody to idolize?         How can you say this person doesn't totally rule? It would just be unamerican.
