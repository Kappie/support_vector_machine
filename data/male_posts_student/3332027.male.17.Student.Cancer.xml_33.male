Friday was well it would have been...um would have been 2 months. I just wanted to speed up that day because I'm still not over it. I slept that whole day and I woke up around 10 P.M, only to fall back asleep and wake up at 3 A.M. I'll have this whole summer to think about it and find a way to get over it completely. I'll never be completely over it, but I'll proboly be enough just to live through the day with a happy face.  Here's the blog song. It's Avril Lavigne -  Naked  He really did make me feel comfartable about being myself.   "I wake up in the morning Put on my face The one that's gonna get me Through another day Doesn't really matter How I feel inside 'Cause life is like a game sometimes  But then you came around me The walls just disappeared Nothing to surround me And keep me from my fears I'm unprotected See how I've opened up Oh, you've made me trust  Because I've never felt like this before I'm naked Around you Does it show? You see right through me And I can't hide I'm naked Around you And it feels so right  I'm trying to remember Why I was afraid To be myself and let the Covers fall away I guess I never had someone like you To help me, to help me fit In my skin  I never felt like this before I'm naked Around you Does it show? You see right through me And I can't hide I'm naked Around you And it feels so right  I'm naked Oh oh yeah Does it show? Yeah, I'm naked Oh oh, yeah yeah  I'm so naked around you And I can't hide You're gonna (you're gonna) see right through, baby you're gonna see right through,  i'm so naked around you, and i can't hide, you're gonna see right through, baby"   *What iF........?*
