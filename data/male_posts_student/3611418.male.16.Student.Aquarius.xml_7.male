"I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you"  "As we grow older together, As we continue to change with age, There is one thing that will never change... I will always keep falling in love with you."  "For, you see, each day I love you more, Today more than yesterday and less than tomorrow."  "Love is the greatest feeling, Love is like a play, Love is what I feel for you, Each and every day, Love is like a smile, Love is like a song, Love is a great emotion, That keeps us going strong, I love you with my heart, My body and my soul, I love the way I keep loving, Like a love I can't control, So remember when your eyes meet mine, I love you with all my heart, And I have poured my entire soul into you, Right from the very start."  "All the love that history knows, is said to be in every rose. Yet all that could be found in two, is less than what I feel for you."   ARE ALL THING I WOULD'VE SAID TO YOU!
