Yeah, well I'm in that position right now. I'm waiting for someone. I can't hear them or see them right now (and to be totally honest, I don't know what the circumstance is around that,) but I would give anything I have for that person I am waiting for to be right next to me, at least talking to me. Everything I see my mind takes and filters out the truth, hoping it can somehow change a shirt on the floor of my brother's room into one of the belongings of her's.   What can I do but wait? I can't wait anymore. This is killing me inside and out. I'm afraid to go outside to do chores because the phone might ring and it might be her. I'm a afraid to shower because I might not hear the doorbell. I'm afraid that she's gone somewhere and it isn't safe right now. I'm afraid I'm not going to see her for quite a while.  Where the fuck is she, anyway?
