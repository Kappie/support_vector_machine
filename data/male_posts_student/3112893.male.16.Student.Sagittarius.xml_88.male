I'm not giving any hints for this one because I think it's on the radio enough for people to know right off what it is. I know I messed up a couple times in there, and I'm not entirely sure about that arpeggio in the rhythm, but I hear something like that in the song, so whatever. Guess away, and as usual post guesses in the comments.    urlLink
