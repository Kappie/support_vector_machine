It's becoming pretty hard for me to do this...Frankly, I don't really know if I can. But I knew from the start of this that it would be better for the both of us...Especially after I was enlightened by my god-ma on that fateful day...  I always saw Her as the perfect little angel, cute and lovable, very kind, very...laughable. At that time I knew she'd be the one for me. But it might have been my fault that it didn't work out, as I am obviously horrible at initiating a relationship. I dunno why, don't ask me. Should get the Idiot's Guide to Love thingy...or what's it called...Anyway, after that day in the canteen, I realized Her true self. (Please...don't mind me typing this...) She, as I had always thought, (although I refused to believe) was a flirt...Yes, there, I said it. She liked to hang around with other guys, acting so close to them. Of course you would know how I felt when that happened. (You know, I really don't mind now.) But in spite of that I perservered, trying every ways and means to get her attention, but to no avail.  When I finally decided that I'd give up all hopes of starting anything with her, I was torn apart, basically. It felt like, Slash, criss cross, jab, slice, then ripped, quartered, then torn to little pieces...Yes, it was a tough decision (apart from what I had to decide on before that...Ughh...) But it was sensible as I had thought, and the same with my peers. I knew I'd done the right thing...  Just seeking to do well with what I have now...and cherish others who truly care for me...I learnt a lot from this...Can you tell? Nevermind. Thanks God-Ma!!
