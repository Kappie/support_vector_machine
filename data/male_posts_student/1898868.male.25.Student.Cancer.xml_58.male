I also have a very slight bend to the left, (not as much as Justin's), but I start out to the right, so I wonder if that negates any chafing I would have. Regardless, I will let the physics graduate students handle the number.  I love Jamba Juice, I have no idea why. I am convinced their beverages ( or are they really beverages?) contain some addictive drug in them. I also love saying Jamba. I also love making fun of people who engage in their fruity consumption, while I remain in the closet, revealing my passionate amore only to my closest confidants.  Stasi, why must you stop friendster dating. Stasi being Stasi, I think it is ridiculous that you don't have 3 or 4 dates a week.  Blogger has now made me late for work....OUTS!!!!
