I would die without music. I play the guitar and have music everywhere I go. I bought a discman for the sole purpose of having music everywhere. People that aren't into music are normally strange (I'm not saying you all are....just most.). I like all kinds of music really, I like jazz, rock, metal, heavy rock, nu-metal, gothic rock, some hip-hop/rap. Almost anything except pop and classical. Some of my favourite bands are The John Butler Trio, Linkin Park, Rammstein, Tool, A Perfect Circle, Jet, Placebo, ....anyway, there's a lot a variety. In music, you can communicate exactly how you feel. Have you ever had that feeling when the words of a song describe how you feel better than you can? I want to sing sometimes and tell everyone. But that's just me.   I was talking to little year seven's todays because they are funny. The Year 7's hug me for no apparent reason. They also have SO much energy. I just can't be bothered keeping up. They are very funny people though. Got to go anyway, hope to see you soon.
