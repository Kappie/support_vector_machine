Went home and cleaned the house. I put away a bunch of clothes and rearranged my desk to make more room.  Ya know, to do more stuff on, like write in this little book.  I called hannah today to see how her birthday went, but she was busy with a few friends.  She is seven. mimi's mom is back at the apartment for two weeks.  I will be so busy next week.  I'm starting to get a little nervous.  No worries.  I'm super hip and thats all good.  I saw mars tonight.  Its really close to earth - and bright as well.
