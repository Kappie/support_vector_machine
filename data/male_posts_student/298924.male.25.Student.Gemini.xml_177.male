First things first, I think Max Kellerman was probably smart enough to copywrite the name of my old College Newspaper column (Around the Horn) so for now I don't have any snazzy title for this little project.  Today was a big sports day for a day with no major games to speak of.  The Pro Bowl rosters were announced today.  As is usually the case I have some issues with some of the players chosen/snubbed.   urlLink Here  you'll find the complete Pro Bowl Rosters.  First things first, Jeremy Shockey's inclusion.  What the hell is the deal with that?  I know that the NFC doesn't have too many standout Tight Ends, but the man played half a season.  Boo Williams of the New Orleans Saints would have been a much better choice.  Itula Mili put up some decent numbers for the Seattle Seahawks as well.  Some pundits (PTI and Around The Horn participants) took exception to the two top teams in each conference by record (Philadelphia and New England) only getting two players apiece on board (incidentally the same number as the ATLANTA FALCONS!!!!).  I personally don't see a problem with it.  To me it illustrates an actual strength of those particular teams.  They are low on star power, but high on depth.  So their strength as a team (and what I feel is going to get them each to the Super Bowl) actually hurts them when it comes time to award individual achievement.  You can ask the Texas Rangers and Alex Rodriguez about that.  Speaking of which, I'm always down to give my two cents about A-Rod.  My first published online work was an article written when A-Rod signed his $250 million dollar contract.  Well it seems like the A-Rod to Boston trade is officially dead.  It's going to be interesting to see how each team and the involved players recover (or not) from this debacle.    On one side we have A-Rod who clearly wanted out of Texas and was willing to lose some money to do so.  I would like to be a fly on the wall in the clubhouse around June or July when the Rangers hit that rough stretch, knowing they won't see the plus side of .500 until the next season.  I'm sure there will be some fireworks of some sort.  How about Nomar Garciapara?  I think the Sox have no choice but to still try and unload him, especially in light of Kevin Millar's statements about wanting A-Rod over Nomar.  I think Nomar has a few choice words for him.  The Red Sox will still be a force in the all of a sudden LOADED AL East.  Let's not forget that the Blue Jays were doing well for a while last year, and although they haven't been major players as of yet in the "Hot Stove League" they will probably be improved on experience alone.  The Baltimore Orioles have finally joined the new century and thrown their hat in the Free Agent arena making moves for Miguel Tejada and possibly Vladimir Guerrero and either Pudge Rodriguez or Javy Lopez.  Anf of course the Yankees are still the Yankees.  So what if Andy Pettite and Roger Clemens are gone, they reload like other teams rebuild.  But just imagine if all of the pieces had come together and Boston had gotten A-Rod and Magglio Ordonez as planned.  Well it looks like imagination is all we have as far as that one goes, and somewhere George Steinbrenner is breathing a sigh of relief.  Meanwhile the fans are left with another disappointment to add to their growing list with Major League Baseball.  Next time I'll talk about Bowl Season and College Basketball.  Peace for now!
