Today's post has prerequisites:  The Pitchfork reviews of  urlLink  Tigertown Pictures   and  urlLink  Realistes  ;  not because I think they have anything important to say, mind you, but because I've been put on notice that if I don't churn out more serviceable product on a more regular basis I might not get paid.  Therefore this review will be interpolated with a review of a review, thereby becoming simultaneously a review and a meta-review, which is more of that postmodern stuff the kids seem to dig.  Most importantly, it will reach a length that doesn't seem like a waste of time to post.  Let me first say that I don't understand the constant Sonic Youth comparisons the  Pitchfork  staff seem intent on making.  The most puzzling example is when it is suggested that early Sonic Youth was "lo-fi pop".  Yeah, lo-fi pop like fucking "Sonic Death", junior.  Comparing everything to "early Sonic Youth" (which means  Goo , maybe?) is the twentysomething version of the constant Boomer-hipster insistence that everything sounds like the Velvet Underground:  The Pixies, Velocity Girl, Les Savy Fav, Fugazi, Spiritualized (okay, bad example), Bardo Pond.  Sure, gramps.  Why don't you just sit back in your easy chair while Grandma Ray spikes you up?  One cannot argue that Comet Gain's sound is in any way original or unique - they have a long string of distinct influences, none of which are Sonic Youth:   urlLink the C-86 movement , Huggy Bear, the Jam, the Smiths and the Who, just to name a couple.  One can however argue contrary to the good people at Pitchfork, who we must remember are entitled to their incorrect opinons, that they rock with a pilled-up intensity those lugubrious noise reptiles in Sonic Youth* haven't managed since "Bad Moon Rising", and not before then either.  "The Kids At The Club" (from  Realistes ) is the perfect expression of the rush you get when you're about to go out and really kick shit up, and "Record Collection" (from  Tigertown Pictures ) is probably the only breakup song I've ever heard that isn't total bullshit.  And that's just first tracks.   Pitchfork  charges pretentiousness.  Exactly.  Pretentiousness, particularly by way of couching your every move in the iconography of the  nouvelle vague  is one of the hallmarks of the twee pop genre to which Comet Gain, for all their feedback scree, well and truly belongs.  But no matter how pretentious Comet Gain get, and leaving out the few slow songs scattered across their albums ( "Sneaky"  being another, not discussed here), they never stop putting out numbers which would fill dance floors everywhere if you weren't so anesthetized to the possibilities of group movement by the Get Up Kids that it takes ! fucking !! beating you over the head with disco to remember that you have hips.  ____ *I like Sonic Youth.
