After cadets yesterday me and david (gender-bender) had a fight and I think its safe to say I creamed him. Nah it was fun and i have a bruised hand where he landed when he fell over. Whitgift is shitty boring damn trip to Croydon (WOW!) to do some environmental survey shit and they didn't have the quorn premier (I'm a veggie) at the McDonalds nearest to E. Croydon station, those butt nuggets. Watch the mighty boosch on E4, saw it last night and it was some fucked up shit. I was going to do something constuctive but hey looks like I'm doing this shit again. If you are reading this and I don't know you, go jump in front of a bus you fucking loser
