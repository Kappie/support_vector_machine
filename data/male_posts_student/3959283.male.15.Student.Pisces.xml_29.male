Son of beast tho was really tall and is the only wooden rollercoaster to have a loop.  it was really really cool.  and then beast is the worlds longest wooden rollercoaster in the world!!!!  but there were many other rides and roller coasters that were really cool.  i got checked out by a few girls, (even a few guys, i'll tell you later, it was gross, you don't even want to know what they were talking about.)  oh yeah the worst part of the visit, but probably the most fun part was the Beast opperator.  every time people started to load onto the train he would begin, if you going to ride the beast clap your hand(clap clap)  and so on.  then when the train was about to leave the station he would go, let me hear you screan as loud as you can, ready 1..2..3 (SREAMS!!!!)  the first time it was ok, but he did it many more times.  i was getting mad.  then about the fourth time he did it.  when every one was sapose to clap, i yelled really loud, THIS IS LAME.  it probably doesn't sound as funny as it realy was.  i was like freakin out at this guy.  i realy hated him with a passion.  but what was really funny was that the only people who were actually clapping were middleaged women.  so that proves how lame he was.  so anyway.  when i got on the train.  he didn't say the clap your hands thing.  YES I HAD AN IMPACT ON HIM!!!!!!  but then he still asked us to scream.  when the train went by his booth thingy, i SCREAMED at him, many things, nothing to get me kicked out tho.  i was freakin out.  but i was on the ride adn away from him.  the ride was fun, but then we got back to the station.  and guess what, he asked us how our ride was.  i was mad.   i was screaming at him.  then we got off and he started the CLAP YOUR HANDS THING AGAIN!!!!!  I WAS SCREAMING SO MUCH AT THIS GUY!!! I WAS REALLY REALLY MAD.  I WANTED TO JUST RIP HIS HEAD OFF.  MY COUSIN MASON IS JUST LAUGHIN AT ME.  my ranting an raving went on a little longer before we went on a differents ride.  but all in all i had a good time.
