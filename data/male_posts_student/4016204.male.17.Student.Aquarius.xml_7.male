I don't know why its called that, but its pretty good.  I love the song "Player."  Its about a girl who's a, well, she's a player.  Jono expresses his feelings about such girls, which pretty near approximate my own.  Go to  urlLink http://www.troikamusic.co.uk/megalithic.shtml  to download the album for free.  It has a lot of Beetles influence, a Cardiff pub feel (that's where Megalithic plays most of their gigs), and some interesting ideas.
