Please keep in mind, references to my handwriting are not edited out.  I have nothing else to post, so I might as well post something that I did in fact write.  Here we go.  Dearest Lola-  I'm writing you a letter, very 7th grade style, from class.  I've been in here, oh, 5 minutes and i'm already so bored that it hurts.  I also have a test in here tonight.  I guess I could be studying for it right now, but whatever.  It's okay, I had pizza for lunch.  how annoying would it be if the ONLY way to keep in touch over distances was through written mail?  I'd lose touch with everyone.  There is NO way that my instant gratification mind would be able to handle the world of Pony Express.  I can barely handle Federal Express.  "Express" my ass, waiting until TOMORROW to get something sucks.  I got rejected from one of my "long-shot" schools today.  That felt cool.  I knew I probably wouldn't get in, but it still was like "awwh, awwh" and then I had to pee.  This professor has cleverly decided (there are lots of d's in the word decided) to make the exam/rape happen @ the end of this 3 hour hell.  Clever man!!!  Now no one can slip out after the exam and be spared the flaming hot hades that is "Business strategy and Policy."  I'm really sorry I never found you a cool postcard in Colorad-ho.  They are obviously NOT a creative bunch.  A ton of stupid postcards with mountains on them.  BOO!  We get that there are mountains, now show us the snow-bunnies!  So I've decided I might MAKE you a postcard. That would be funner and more personal all at once.  We'll see if I follow through with that by the end of this letter.  (ps- by "make" I mean draw, not construct out of purchased materials from Michaels).  I like shoes.  I really do.  Some people in here have some kickin' kicks.  We get a participation grad in this class.  I think I already forfeit those points.  Eh, give them to someone else, someone who gave a damn, somebody more like myself, and theseeee foolish gamessss are tearing me apart.. oh wait, sorry.  Jewel took over my body for a min.  Like Whoopi in "Ghost."  When Jewel took over my body, my tooth was fucked up and I think I flashed the professor and maybe made out with some random people.  Everyone enjoyed.  I feel like Meg and Hamilton Swan listening to Harlan Pepper right now as this boring class drones on.  Seriously where at ethe cameras?  Where's the candid fuckin camera?  Cause this is a JOKE, and it's been only like 15 minutes.  I want to throw something at someone.  Preferably at someone wearing a date-party shirt, OR someone wearing carpenter pants.  OR that kid (take your pick) that I hate for no reason.  There are some Kappas in here, and 7/8 of them suck REAL bad.    Aren't you excited that I have cable?  I'm kinda disappointed, honestly, because there is nothing on ever.  I guess since I used to have it ALL for free, now it seems like I Have zero channels.  Good news:  Where The Heart Is will surely be on soon.  I thought of you last night because Comedy Central was having a MadTV marathon.  After that much generic Mac, anyone would be sick.  Want to go get trashed soon?  Like, take-a-cab-home-trashed?  I do!  I want to have a night of drunken, dubious, crazed, drinking that requires a safe ride (and not a DUI).  The professor just mentioned L.L. Bean.  It comes full circle to Hamilton Swan.  Thank GOD for catalogs.  By the by, sorry about the handwriting.  I dont' know how you're even reading this.  I dont care either, this is therapeutic to me.    I need to run, bike, or something. I'm getting hefty even with a trainer.  I'm basically treading water it seems.  Granted I've been to the gym like a total of 5 times.  God I'm too instant-oriented.    There is a sign (very make-shift looking) at the front of the room that reads:  "Maximum Occupancy: 48."  Is this fuckin' Applebees??  DO you think someone will bring me nachos?  I doubt it too.  What if I ordered a pizza to be delivered to my class?  I wonder how that would be received by Captain Bore (professor).  When the cable man came today, I was stone-cold sleeping.  I bet that was fun for him to have my weird looking self, half naked, answer the door all confused.  There's a weird door @ the front of the room and I want to know where it goes.  It's like one of those swinging doors seen in many restaurant kitchens across our great nation.  I kind of want something odd to pop out of there, like a band of marching clowns, have them march around the room, and then go right back through the door as if nothing.  Stranger things have happened.. not sure what though.  The girl in front of me just totally fucked up her pony tail.  Should I tell her?  It's irritating me.  It's all ratty and shit now.  I'm now playing the "who would i trade with" game.  There's only one guy I think I'd trade with in here.  I'm still gonna say I'm way more better, but he's got me on the arms and dark hair.  Otherwise, yep, i'm better than the others in here.  Hang on, I"m gonna play for you too.  K, yeah, you win in here too, trust me.  Okay new pen, new class, new day.  It's Tuesday now.  I feel like butt hole today.  Totally congested and just what.  I'm in Marketing Channels now, hoping I dont get called on for anything.  This pen SUCKS as much as this day does.  What a cool coincidence.  It's funny that I've written you a novel.  Maybe I should just keep going for years like a journal dedicated to you.  Like Anne Frank wrote to "Kitty" but you're REAL.  Maybe Kitty was real too.  But then again, who names their kid "Kitty."  (A Jew apparently).  Wasn't there something all risque about Anne Frank?  Like didn't she talk about being a lesbian or something?  I swear I heard that somewhere.  I'm pissed at this pen!  It was free, I can totally see why now too.  Whenever I have my own corporation, I"m going to give away GOOD pens.  Mont Blanc pens made of pure gold that spell check things as you write somehow.  I'll remember this when I'm in a cubicle somewhere.  Oh Lola, only 30 more minutes of pure hell.  Aren't you glad you're not in school anymore and can you believe that I still am??  Well on that note, I will close.  I will probably never follow-through on mailing this.  Love, Mason
