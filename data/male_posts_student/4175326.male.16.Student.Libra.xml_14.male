I've written alot of songs, but I just thought this one needed some work, so any helpful hints would be gladly accepted. Thanks.                                          America The Beautiful    God bless the USA, where the rednecks beat the gays, the army kills who they desire, and the president's a liar.  God bless United States Enron, Oil, and Bill Gates. Imperialism is back in style, Our popstars are pedifiles.  God bless the corporations rich snobs and the Fox station. Gas prices on the rise, Cheap beer and freedom fries.  America the Beautiful (x3) America is FUCKED!
