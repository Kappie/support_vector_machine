Da Hogs lost to Arizona on Father's day 7-2, which wasn't as bad as our lose to texas, which was 13-2.  We haven't been to the College World Series in a long time so it was pretty cool for the hogs to make it as far as they did, they represented us well.  Perhaps even more so next year.  Well anyways I'm gonna have a final update on my sub-profile this shut that sucker down :'( all well I suppose I enjoy updating this website more than I do a silly sub-profile all the time, it will be better to come and look at this 10 years later than the sub-profile.  Nonetheless, to something I do on my sub-profile, to the events! Current Events (stolen from da bunny)  Where: "Big Sur"!  Time: 6:00!  What's new?:  This website!
