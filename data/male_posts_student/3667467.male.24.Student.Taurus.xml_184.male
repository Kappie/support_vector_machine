It was pretty downtrodden and finally the property was sold—so I hear—to put up a new Dunkin’ Donuts (YES!). So the building was torn down last fall. Its remains sit there still, covered in several inches of snow. Apparently, but not shockingly, that’s illegal. The big bad town of Newstead is trying to bring the owners to task for getting rid of the debris. The weekly Akron Bugle seems confused, however. Sure, what’s left still legally a “building,” but it’s like they don’t know that WE know it’s really a pile. This week’s paper reiterates that “Owners of the property will have an opportunity to appear in person and provide evidence that the property is not in violation of the provisions of the Unsafe Building Law during the hearing.” Good luck, guys! It also outlines what the Unsafe Building Law STATES, like we need to know that? I was originally going to list all 12 possible violations of this “building,” but come on. There is no building. The walls and roof are parallel to each other. If you wanted to vacuum the carpet you’d have to rent a forklift. To light a fire in the chimney, you would use the master bedroom as kindling. This is a Late Parrot!
