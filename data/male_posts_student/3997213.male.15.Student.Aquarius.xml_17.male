I had to watch Riley while mom went to work from 9:00 to 1:00. My nana is pretty sick so I might be watching Riley a little more often now. Not that I mind watching her though. She's may be a handful (getting into chocolate and throwing the remote across the room) but it's not too bad. At least mom comes home with Burger King. That's a good reward. I had a whopper junior today. It was free from the Spiderman scratch off game. Normally I eat a whopper and a medium fry but I ate Chinese food left over from yesterday so I was kinda full. Reid and Riley fell asleep today so I got to play a video game for a while. It was nice being able to play a game without Reid whining to watch Cartoon Network. That's the only thing he watches. I'm serious. I don't know why we're paying for these other channels when the only thing on is Nickolodean and Cartoon Network. Urgh! Sometimes it makes me mad cause he expects me to do the same. Sorry but I like some variety in my shows.
