Lunch, James made me spit out my drink by making a funny face. Today I babysat Mike and Chris. Easy. I just realized my journal entries keep getting shorter as school progresses, maybe because it's THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Wow, 9 months, I've been doing this thing, I can't wait for the 1 year anniversary! Paul was going to come over but I had too much homework. Ok read me tomorrow!
