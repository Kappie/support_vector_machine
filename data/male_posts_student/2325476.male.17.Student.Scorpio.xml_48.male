Prolly not goin to CCDS prom. *shrug* whoop-de-doo...  Grades are bad, tho i can't say i care enough to jump on fixing that.  But at least i've always got my... hmm... can't think of anything.   yea, that sounds about right.    nothing has any feeling anymore. nothing really excites me, nothing really enrages me. I don't really wish or hope for anything. Ic an't tell you ifone thing tastes "better" than another, just that they both have a taste. I feel like I'm not alive. I don't even feel like I'm dreaming. I feel like I'm watching someone else's life play out...  I've felt this way my whole life more or less. 'Cept a few months in Virginia. And it's not that I'm not surrounded by cool people, because I am, I just don't feel alive.
