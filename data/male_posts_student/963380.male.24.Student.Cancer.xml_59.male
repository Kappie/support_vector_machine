I crested a ridge in my car, driving on the highway. As I did, the lights of the city glittered in front of me - a defect in my contacts lenses - as they dried out, the image in front of me twinkled. It was very beautiful, but at that moment, I thought "I wonder if anyone else has ever seen this?". It's sort of disheartening to realize that, along the lines of Gattaca, you're a defective human being. Should natural selection have weeded me out? Meh, it's just my eyes, but still. As a kid I always felt bad about sports simply because I couldn't see the ball or puck or birdie. Mom thought I was trying to get attention, assumed I wanted to be like Kneale Turner (my best friend) cause he'd just got glasses. Sad really. Not that I blame mom. She's the best mom I've got, and i wouldn't trade her for the world.  Went snowboarding today. I'm sure it was cold outside, (-18 degrees centigrade) but it certainly helps to have the right equipment. I haven't lost much of the skill I had last year... after the first few runs, I was back to my old style... felt great. Not usually a speed junkie, but there's a lot to be said about whipping down a snow basted slope on a slab of graphite and aluminum with only your wits and a bit of plastic holding you together. There's a lot to be said, and I'm sure I'll say more about it over the next few weeks.  Reading CNN right now, it seems that the world is going to hell in a rather large overly well armed hand basket. A few shout outs to my homeys - North Korea, Iraq, the chaps of al Queda - FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU RIGHT IN THE EAR. God damn commie-dictator-fanaticmuslim bastards! (note to normal, law abiding Muslims who don't believe I'm a representative or a member of the "Great Satan" - you're all right. Get these other fellahs in order, eh?) Speaking of North Korea - What the fuck?? I thought communism had been ground under the rather stylish designer jackboot of capitalism a long time ago. You guys are sooooo 1983 it's not even funny. Feck off ya radge bastards.
