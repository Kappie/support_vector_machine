"Ever noticed how the anchorman (or woman) always gives that corny expression when the weatherman forecasts something 'disappointing'?... Weatherman (Sad)- "On Saturday, we're lookin' at Scattered T-Storms. Back to you Cindy and Bob..." Bob the Anchorman (Sarcastically) "Gary, Thanks a lot! T-Storms again!?!"  Denis again "We'll you never hear the anchorman reply to news like...'12 dead in out-of-control train wreck? Thanks a lot Cindy!"  ha..
