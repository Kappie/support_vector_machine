To lighten the stress of school, I just finished reading Sean Covey's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens, patterned after his father's The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, which Jason (Jr. Olympic Gymnast and neighbor, also known as The Incredible Bulk) gave to me for my Bar Mitzvah but which I got bored of reading and so switched to this. I recommend it. I'm also anticipating the new oppurtunities that will be open to me in high school, including but not limited to better access to Newtonville and a couple of my friends' houses. Look at the post below for more.
