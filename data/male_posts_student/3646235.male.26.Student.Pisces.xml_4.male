It's so funny how a dog is training for kids.  I'm a lot dirtier now than I used to be.  Puppy kisses?  Sure!  Muddy paws?  No problem!  Gotta dig something out of her mouth?  Excellent!  Seriously, I get slimed about once a day now.  I'm sure kids will be the same.  You also become more protective.  Messing with my dog?  Over my dead body!  Not feeling good, pooch?  Sympathy to the rescue!  I love that dog.  As much as she can be a pain in my ass, she's wonderful.  We really have to prioritize though.  Don't go out as much as we used to (especially when we first got her!).  Have to let the dog out.  And if she doesn't go to puppy daycare, she needs to be played with.  Dogs.  Kids.  Hmm, they should be pretty neat too.  Word of the Day: equivocal - ambiguous; open to two interpretations
