Well just to further state that opinion, in biology class we did a bacteria and virus lab on the water fountain, and in less then 24 hours, 91 colonies of "streptobacillus" a.k.a. strept throat grew. By tomorrow, there should be 500 colonies or more. So the next time you go to drink from the water fountain think to yourself "This is full of viruses. Lets spend money on bottled water instead and stay healthy"   Just something I found somewhat interesting.
