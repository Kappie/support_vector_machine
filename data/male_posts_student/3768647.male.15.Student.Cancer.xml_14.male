MMORPG have been a some what scarce commodity but with the occurence of this new game by an Indian Developer Ragnarok though i havt tried it things do seem to look really bright ahead In smaller cities though the thought of even gaming is just propping up,except a few people others have just started playing games(atleast some progress).Multiplayer games are somewhat completely out of the topic. Ok so anyway life goes on and so does progress.Who knows India may be a World leader in gaming and game development some day(yeah right............someday.......)
