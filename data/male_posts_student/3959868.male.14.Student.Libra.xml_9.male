She tells me that she's unpopular--good thing--but I don't understand why. Yea, we go to different schools. I have to say at least this about her: She has a beautiful body, but she has a mind just as beautiful. About 5'3"(good thing because I'm 6'2"). Brownish eyes, black hair. The perfect face. Shes not a prep and shes not Gothic. I honestly dont know where she is. I dont care either really. As long we both hate preps, its all good. She almost has a lower self-esteem than me, but if she wants it to be, she has a lot of work to do. She's trying to kill me with all of the compliments she gives me. I could guarantee they're lies in my point of view. She disagrees. Iunno
