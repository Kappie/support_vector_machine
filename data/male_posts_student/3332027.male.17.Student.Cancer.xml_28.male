This is an AJaY original.   snapple coated kisses so sweet and ample like waves of sweetness caressing my lips and tongue the air was brisk and light the warmth of your skin only drew me closer to you like a ray of light in the dark sleepy eyes smiled under a relaxed body as we lay side by side on an ocean of blankets flowing into eachother a day wasnt long enough to completely appreciate the curve of your lips as you smiled at me or the warmth of your hand fingers lightly sliding down my face lifting the strands of hair from my eyes and touching my lips so soft or the innocent look on your face as you closed your dark eyes under the rise and fall of your chest your heart raced with my touch the sound of your whisper  with your lips pressed to my ear hand on my neck so gentle plays like a broken record and relaxes my mind heavy with a million thoughts sweet dreams of you are all i can hope for because now that you're gone my life is empty with out you i miss the rainy nights we drown in conversation at the park under the sky like a pourous bucket starlight trickled from each star above and shed light upon our faces ill always remember the glow your eyes twinkled with happiness under a mysterious facade you hid from the world like a scared child and ran from your feelings which were unknown to you and in an instant you were gone.
