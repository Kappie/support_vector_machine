The other with a middle aged Castilliano who hates english y habla con un accento... Bleh... El Accento Castilliano no esta buena.  So much lisping! The Lisping and the lisping! It sounds so odd to hear it actually spoken, since I've only read about how it sounds in text books.  It just interrupts the flow of it with the lisp.
