I took Steve's airsoft gun and was "shooting" people with it, even though I had no bullets or ammo, it was fun to just aim it at people and pull the trigger.  I took that as a bad sign...:-S  People I care for, people I have newly discovered I cared for, people I dislike, people I dislike a lot, it didn't matter.  I just pulled the trigger, and it felt good.  Then I went away from them all in the loft area, and no one was even looking for me or nuthin'.  They were talking about me quite a bit though....but not actually lookin' for me.  Which makes me feel as if...if I do go away on a vacation, no one would kare.  It wouldn't even affect people, most of you probably wouldn't even notice that I left, unless I had announced it.  Which also makes me think, that if I were to take a permanent vacation....no one would kare.  That's just depressin' right there.  All except for one of you.  Carly told me not to disappear forever...that was nice.  For once in the evening, I felt wanted....not even wanted, just....noticed.  Sumone noticed that I was alive.  heh...I had a funny thought earlier today when I had first arrived at Brittany's and there was still sum akward stuff goin' on.  I wanted to see what people would do if you got them drunk then gave them a gun.  Not everyone in the world, just people in our friend group.  Basically, I can break it down into two groups: those who would shoot themselves, and those who would shoot everyone around them.  I can think of people in both cases...  I'm gonna go now...before I get more messed up and more depressing/pissed and stuff.  Spense  P.S. Damn everyone who wouldn't give me a ride home.  Damn you, and you, and...OH...especially you.
