Very interesting, and a lot of fun. Great, good people. Anyway, after that, went home, went to watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, I was really looking forward to it. And no, I'm not disappointed, but it could and should have been better. The teachers, whom added so much flavor to the previous offerings, were absent for most of the movie. Characters and events werenâ€™t fleshed out well enough, and something just felt missing. Other than that, it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie, and I'd easily recommend it. Just don't go in with the same anticipation as I did.
