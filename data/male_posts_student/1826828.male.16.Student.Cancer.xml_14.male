Right, in order to stem the floods of anger descending upon me from my friend (or at least, my acquaintance)  urlLink Amphion , I add the following:     "I, Dom Main, reserve all right to steal the idea of a post shunning all browsers except that of my choice, from the above person. Admittedly, the layout/content of the following are somewhat similar to Amphion's, but that is because this is intended as a counter-attack. Oh, and Opera is  poo ."  Just one thing... Use  urlLink Firefox  for browsing the internet, Instead of Internet Explorer.  1. Firefox is much  faster  - pages load in a fraction of the time. 2.  Tabbed Browsing  - allows you to have multiple pages open at once without having multiple copies of Firefox - surprisingly useful! 3.  Download Manager  - Just helps you organize downloads, auto-downloading options allow you to download certain file types (of your choice) to a specific place automatically. You can even hide the download manager completely, and be informed by a polite little box in the corner that you're downloads have all finished. 4.  Popup Blocker  - easy and built in. 5. It looks  nice  - not all that important - but Firefox looks nicer that IE. 6.  Searching  - small search box on right - easy searching. 7. Most of the space is devoted to the  webpage . After all, you don't want other things obscuring the view! 8. Firefox  loads faster , it's a nice small browser, not bloated and smelly like IE.  Firefox is admittedly still on version 0.9.2 or something - so it isn'Â’t quite finished, but I have been using it since version 0.6, and haven't come across any bugs yet - the countdown to release 1 is just interface changes and feature-adding.  Those silly enough to use Opera will probably be comparing the above list with Opera's many features. However, Opera just doesn't offer the same level of compatibility as the Mozilla/Firefox breed - ActiveX, though just a nasty Microsoft thing, is not supported in Opera. Plus I don't personally find opera as stable or as intuitive an interface as Firefox.  If you want more features - i.e. power user/web designer, use  urlLink Mozilla . Mozilla isn't so much a browser as an  Internet Suite  - it has a truly excellent mail client, IRC client, download manager, popup blocker and HTML editor. Of course, these features aside, it is a fast, secure and stable internet browser as well.  If (this is almost it, I promise) you don't want a web client rolled in with your browser (i.e. Mozilla). But still don't want to use Outlook (with good reason), head over to Mozilla.org's other masterpiece,  urlLink Thunderbird . It's an Outlook-style email client with a difference. It's fast, stable and secure. With built in (very good) spam blocking, fully customisable interface and abundance of features, Thunderbird is the perfect companion to Firefox.   All three of these Mozilla.org products are fully extendible thanks to the brilliant  extensions  concept, which allows amateur (and professional, if they like :) developers to extend and adapt the software to they're own needs. -- Anyway - off to Greece tomorrow! So don't expect postage for a while. -- Dom out
