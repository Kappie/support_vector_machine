Its used for online journals like this one, ebay, and other auction sites......This way you can put your pics up on websites.....The downside is that most places want you to pay money to use their image hosting sites....There are free ones but they are limited, they have limits on the size of your images, how much memory your pictures use and how much ppl view your images.....it really sucks but what can you do ?im not paying for image hosting....i know some people are using YahooPictures! to do image hosting, using the URL's from their images on yahoo linked to other websites but that only works for a little while.....yahoo has this policy that you cant use their Picture site for image hosting....I tried it first and it worked but after a few hits the image wouldnt show up ! I checked out yahoo's site and their terms of service, it says you cant do it ..... which sucks...its been a big headache but i think i got it taken care of...only downside to photobucket.com is that my images cant be bigger than 250KB......but i guess ill have to live with that......
