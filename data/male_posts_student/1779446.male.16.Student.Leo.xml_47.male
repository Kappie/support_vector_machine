Sitting at a computer, trying to think of what to type up...  But seriously, have you ever thought of life? I have. You know what really sucks? I dunno, I'm just bored... nothing to do, I'm pretty unmotivated and my brand new acoustic guitar is out of tune and has to be regularly re-tuned. >:(  Right now? I'm checking my email. I still haven't found a decent place for my work experience!!! ARRGH! I am officially in panic mode.   FARK, life is slow.  Colin
