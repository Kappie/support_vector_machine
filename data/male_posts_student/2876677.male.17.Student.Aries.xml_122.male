I still haven't thought of a title for this post.  Hopefully, it is a good one.  No one has commented since Jenna and PP left.  Come back...I need readers...I also need my first paycheck...it is as good as spent...so anyways...i stole a copy of hamlet today...i think i will go read it...i hear it is a good read.
