So there I was starving, no gas in my car because I had 200 dollars that I couldn't touch. My other account...has a 3 day hold. Except for the cheque from the Saks gov. It had a 5 day hold. Now, by 5 days, I don't mean 5 days. I mean 5 business days. Which means that if you put the money in any day except Monday, it's actually 7 days. A week to get your own bloody money. I just don't get it....  urlLink  postCount('banks');
