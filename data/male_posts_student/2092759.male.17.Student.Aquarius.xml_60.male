The concept is, for those of you who are unaware, the network sets up a real expert (without a clue that the show is fake) with a comedian and have them debate an issue. Its priceless for anyone who ever watches  Hannity and Colmes ,  Crossfire , or  Hardball   and I highly recommend it. Quote from the second episode, dealing with the legalization of Marijuana: "Name one Role model in America who has not gotten high once!"- Comedian "President Bush."- Expert, after a few minutes of thought and cagoling "Thank you for proving my point." Classic.  I noticed something the other day when John Kerry announced John Edwards as his running mate.  In the background, "Johnny B. Good" was blasting from speakers. That has to be the lamest joke i have ever heard in my life and i love the Democrats for it.  Speaking of Catholic boys, we'll get to the Profile of the day.  The ninth greatest character in Comic Book history:   Matt Murdock AKA Daredevil      Matt is the personification of whats commonly referred to as "Catholic Guilt". In Matt's mind everything in the world is his responsibility. He needs to fix it, or he hasnt tried hard enough. The desire to please his god and his father's memory drive him to do everything he can (and cant)do to change the ills of the world.     With little or no initiative Matt becomes his enemy. In donning the guise of the Devil, Matt seeks to absolve himself of the sins he commits during the night. My removing himself, at least superficially from the pain and the madness, Daredevil seeks to fight through the moral objections he has to what he does. Catholicism, at its heart, is based upon the thought that God forgives people for what they do, but your going to be going through alot of shit.     This angst is only added to by the fact that Matt's mother abandoned him and his father at a young age to become a Nun. While Matt didnt know where she went for a great many years    , the knowledge lead to a crisis of faith. Of all of the hero's in existance between DC and Marvel, Matt is most likely the unluckiest. His personal life is... lacking to say the least. All of his girl friends end up being evil or wind up dead. Electra dies. Karen Page dies. Typhoid Mary is a fucking lunatic. The Black Widow is a Soviet Assasin turned Avenger, so she comes with her own set of emotional baggage. All of these hectic personal ties, coupled with the Catholic Guilt, turn Daredevil into one of the most convoluted messes of a man in all of literature.    What makes him an amazing character is his ability to fight his war despite these pains. He fights through the guilt and the pain. He disregards the ravages of his faith and his concience to save the world from itself. When its all said and done, Matt Murdock is the definition of a Hero.
