Lists $5. Sold ONLY at the party, so don't miss out! **************  Doesn't charging money seem like a bad idea?    Think of the counter-argument:  But how else can you possibly get a list of 10 random people who happen to answer a small sample of survey questions somewhat similarly to you????????  Isn't that worth a $15 entry fee + $5 list fee + hoping that at least one of the people on your list also showed up + the chance you can actually find them in the crowd of the people + the chance that you're actually on their list too + the incredible odds that since you both like "reading," "watching movies" and "eating food" that you must be perfectly compatible in every way??????  Actually, it sounds like it would make a great parody commercial, like those Mastercard ads.  A box of chocolates... $10 A dozen roses... $30 A list of 10 people who answered some survey questions sort of like you did... Priceless.  Oh wait, no, actually it's five dollars.
