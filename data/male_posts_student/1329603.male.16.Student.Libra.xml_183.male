Well done Sarah. Anyhow, yeah, that wasn't anything to read into, it was a bit of a blunt statement.  Becky and I are currently having a kind of email rally, which is good. Keeping in touch kinda. It's good because I hate to lose touch with people, and I got on with her really well at the Les Mis aftershow deeley, so funfun.  Women problems, as per usual. C'est la vie. I don't quite take them in my stride but it's so common for me now that it's hardly a huge problem (women liking me is uncommon but me liking them is just a little more than ordinary). You learn to deal with things.  Course, there's the Carmina performance tonight and then IT'S OVEEEEEEER! Woot. I hate Carmina, hate hate hate. I hate the fact that we're doing the 2 piano + percussion version, I hate the fact that we don't have a fully trained choir, I hate the fact that the female soloist has a bad throat, I hate the fact that the baritone soloist sounds like he's been jump-started.... gah, and I hate the fact it's out of my range for most of it. So glad it's over after tonight!  Strange thing that's happened while Scott's been away, I've been getting on better with Marx, Stanners and sometimes Adam (he's a bit tempramental, in that some times he mutters to Joe that he'd like to kill me, but he's alright). But yeah. Anyway..  Si je serai tout seul, m'aiderai tu? Please, French scholars, tell me if that's right. I've been thinking about that, it doesn't seem to make logical sense but I think it's what it'd be.  Oh, and I got Silence yesterday. Yay! So, that's 3 of the 4 SA albums I have. Takatalvi is, I think, a best of type one...  Quote of the day: "While you are sleeping, I steal your earring. I light you one candle, This anger I handle. They said I won't find you, But now, I'm beside you, Lost, or you're taken, You should now by now that you're alone."  From Sonata Arctica's   The End of this Chapter   Love, Jon Roskilly
