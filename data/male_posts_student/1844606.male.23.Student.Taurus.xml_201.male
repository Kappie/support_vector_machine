Yet, all I can think about is the time and effort I've absolutely wasted over the two years working towards an honors thesis.  Two and a half years of honors classes, papers and 2500 pages of reading per class.  Apparently, I missuse commas, have poor grammar and in conjunction with two misspelled words (within a text of over 15,000 words) have contributed to my downfall.  I could man up and say it all lies on my shoulder, yada yada yada, but the more I look at it, it becomes increasingly apparent that if my advisor had been around, I would have been in far better shape.  Its tough to second guess, but I'm the king of it.  Besides the Cubs muffing games six and seven, a particularly disasterious weekend in Iowa, this event is the worst I've ever felt.
