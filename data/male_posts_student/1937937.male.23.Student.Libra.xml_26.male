Later on, after the sun came up in the morning, I got out of bed and went over to Hector's house. .  Hector and I went for an adventure, which I won't recount here, suffice to say that cigarettes and mayonnaise were intimately involved.  After school, I went out with my friend Bob (who's picture I won't put here, because I forgot to ask his permission).  Bob and I went to the Biltmore.  I don't know if you've ever been there, but it's absolutely gorgeous.  It used to have the largest pool in the known universe.  The world's largest swimming pool is now  urlLink here  (no, not literally in that word, but follow that link and you'll probably be bored).      My friend Beah is named after bouganvillas -- that was her nickname when she was little, and she couldn't pronounce it so she started saying "Beah".  I'm sure you see the connection.      So here are some bouganvillas, in Beah's honor.      Here's the corridor you've got to walk down in order to get to the pool --      Which, as you can see, is stunning -- more pictures --          Next post, I'll put up pictures of my new apartment, which is really beautiful.  The main concern I have about it is that the people who live and work in this place are  really  weird.  I wouldn't be surprised if they were all CIA agents... I hope I don't get molested!  (Who doesn't?)
