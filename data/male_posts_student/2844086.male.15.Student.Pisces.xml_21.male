Anyway I don't guess anything new has happened since WinterFest except I got my drivers linces like 3 days after that post!  I'm kinda scared to drive though. Too many crazy people out there, and I hate having someone in the car with me.  Oh wait I just remembered something. We went to Teen Talent and the Band (singers included) won contemporary praise category! So in August I'm headed to San Antonio!! OH YEAH! The drama team didn't win anything which makes me really mad 'cause we worked hard. But it'll be ok.  Anyway i gotta run to Church for practice and then Church! Maybe I'll actually be able to start posting soon!  oh yeah I've also published some stuff at  urlLink poetry.com . Just go there and type in my name.
