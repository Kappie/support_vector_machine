Then i sold 2 games to them and bought  Freedom Fighters  and  Manhunt . Freedom fighters is good and if ne1 wants manhunt ill trade them for a diff game. Then after that went searching for dressers at all those cheap furniture stores in downtown hayward, didn't find anything but expensive cheap furniture i would rather buy good shit for the same price. Yea now im sitting in my room online listenin to some Devin the Dude. Nothing else todo...so how are u doing? Oh your silent, i understand. FUCK YOU THEN BITCH. Yea so ima sit and just say some stuff cause theres nothing todo and im bored like i have already stated. Feelin soo wonderful. Did alot of calf raises today cause my knees don't hurt that much so i can start dunking easy again and by season, someone will get dunked on. Today while i was looking for furniture a  BIG  ass plane flew over my head, i swear if i wasn't next to the airport i would have been extremely frightened . Im just gonna list my goals for this schoolyear.      Get straight A's to raise my GPA     Dunk on someone           Get a Job     Windmill     Get accepted into a mediocre college  take the slang word   hella   out of my vocabulary because its stupid and i don't know how i got caught up in saying it                                                 -and the list goes on......
