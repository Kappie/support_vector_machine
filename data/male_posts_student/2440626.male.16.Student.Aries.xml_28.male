     
      Almost another week has gone by.  Sorry everyone, but life is SO busy. Firstly, I would just like to ask "Where'd the trailer go?"  Secondly, I'd just like to say, "Mini-sushi."  I feel much better now.  Now.  Where was I.  Oh yes,  SO busy.  I am really not looking forward to Thursday.  I am gonna be stuck in Pringle's class for an HOUR AND A HALF, as if 45 minutes isn't long enough.  And tomorrow, I have Messiah Coney for and hour and a half.  Now that I can deal with.
