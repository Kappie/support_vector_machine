Unfortunately, i know what the topic is which i reckon is worse than not knowing because now you have no reason to screw it up. And to follow that up, on Friday i have an english speech assessment task on mental illness. YAY!! Researching topic on social attitudes towards mental health. Managed to get a 113 page analysis of social attitudes in Britain. Teacher wants all written references so she can mark them. This is seriously going to screw my printing bill at school. Anyway today was a pretty average day. Nothing happened in school. More stuff happened outside of school. For example on the way to sport, i learnt about ilia's attitudes towards Russians, Jews, Cossacks, Czechens, Hindus, Asians, Americans and basically every other race on the planet. I won't write it here coz it might offend some people, but if you want to find out go talk to ilia about his list of hated people and what he plans to do to them. Also got dropped 5m during rockclimbing because Rajiv is retarded and can't belay for nuts. Muscles still aching in body but not as bad as before. At least now i can sneeze, laugh and cough without to much pain. Ben hasn't been to school in the last two days and that means there is something seriously wrong with him. Hopes he gets better soon! While reading the paper i learnt about the magic mathematical ratio of "phi". This ratio is 1:1.618. Why am i rambling about maths? Because those who possess this divine ratio are beautiful. Not just average good looking but like really good looking. [Orly must have it (glances at Fel)]. So how do you find out if you have "phi"? Go to www.beautyanalysis.com, download a phi mask and stick it over a picture of your self. I haven't done it yet so go do it and post a comment on this blog (don't have to mention whether your beautiful or not). Just to make all the ugly people (glances at andy) feel better, if you don't possess phi it doesn't mean your ugly, just average looking, which is ok, so don't stress. So go to the site, play around with it and leave a comment! Have fun pplz!
