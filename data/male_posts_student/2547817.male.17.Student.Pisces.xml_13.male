I promised Zel that I'd get fit for her, she laughed it off and said that she was fine with a cuddly teddy-bear.  What use is a cuddly teddy-bear it you're not going to cuddle it? I believe in a thing called love, just listen to the rhythm of my heart. Freakily falsettoish. If you get the chance, go listen to The darkness's I believe in a thing called love. The MTV is hell weird, but it gets good after a while.  She was sensitive. I was impatient.  Thinking now I wonder, was it my fault? It was almost prefect, was she the one? I couldn't take it, was I a fool? naive to this new game, was it my last round?  There's something I wanted to say; I've forgotten.  There's nothing I have left to loose.
