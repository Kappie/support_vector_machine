Now, if I can't get in touch with Blogger.com, I can E-mail a post to an e-mail address I chose to have through Blogger, the subject of the E-mail being the subject of my post, and the body as the post. It's so cool. I also have  urlLink Audioblogger . When I'm away I have 85 ways to post still! Woo hoo!   I graduate tomorrow! Woo freaking hoo! It feels weird because it's not BLS. I hate to admit it, but I kind of miss the place. I miss Laura, I miss SWolf, Henn Jr. (Danny Gobble), Tyler, Waggle (Miranda Weigel), etc. It's weird. I never thought I'd miss anything. I guess you never know what you have until it's gone. As the song says, "You don't know what you got 'til it's gone." (Counting Crows,  Big Yellow Taxi )  Whelp, I gotta go! Problems to take care of! Laterness!  In Christ, Mike >
