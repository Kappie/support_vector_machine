I hanged out with some friends for a while.  I started living below the poverty line.  I didn't go on vacation.  I sat here for literally hundreds of hours.  I slept for days on end.  I stayed awake for days on end.  I watched softcore porn on showcase.  What a great summer its been.  What a great school year this will be.  I'm not going to be in the yearbook this year.  I don't think I'm going to have enough money to get a tux.  I don't think I'm going to have enough money to pay for electricity.  On a rollercoater ride, all the while rotting here in suburbia.  Except it's Forest Lawn instead.
