I intend to leave a little about how I am doing in with my useless blogs I would like you to comment on. Here is the first useless blog I want comments on. It is a topic that I would like a little help with: I will most likely be asking this really cool girl that I know pretty well now to be my girlfriend. Here is the problem: As Christians, since we will not be doing anything inappropriate, or sexual, if you will, is there any other reason to date in the first place as teenagers except by name only (girlfriend/boyfriend)? Topic: Teen dating, right or wrong; teen dating, useless or full of meaning? Please comment, and have a great day!  God bless!  -Mike
