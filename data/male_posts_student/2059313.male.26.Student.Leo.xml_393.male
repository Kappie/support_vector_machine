Here's a quick run-down of some of the highlights:  - arrived and it felt like a family reunion ( the good kind ) - cleaned 150 lighting instruments and uncoiled over 5000 feet of cable - hung a pipe grid and created a makeshift truss - played basketball - played ultimate frisbee - ate lots of good food (5 meals a day) - had lots of laughs with new and old friends  That pretty much sums it up for the moment, folks, except for some specific stories that I don't have the time to go into right now.  I hope everyone that reads this is enjoying their summer to some extent.  I know I am... I mean what's better than doing something you absolutely love - AND getting paid for it!?  over and out
