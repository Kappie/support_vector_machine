Each village will receive PHP 27,000  for their livelihood projects which will be paid back at 6% interest annually.    The Microloan Aggreement:    1-year at 6% interest. Half paid off by the first 6-months. Fully paid off within 1-year. Enough in microloans to give each family in the sitios about PHP 1,000 for farming, garden needs, etc.
