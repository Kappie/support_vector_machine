I warned them I wasn't good but they needed even teams so I put my tennis stuff aside. My team actually won 3 games, despite my poor performance. Then two other guys showed up- Mike Elder and none other than Nate Lucas. Wearing loafers. I was suddenly no longer the worst player on the court. Lucas was against me, and I was pitted against him to guard him. Not that he took a lot of shots...  Then he took off his shirt. It just got funnier. One time, he jumped, kicking his heels up behind himself, looked for someone to pass it to, and, finding nobody, just landed. It was pretty funny. My team went 5-0 before we broke up.   In further news, I had the day off so I finished Stranger in a Strange Land. It'll take a good while to digest. I'm moving on through the rest of his stuff.   The Pokeddiction... I don't know why. Maybe its the suspense. A good question to analyze is: why did it lose it's appeal? School stamped it out... we were moving on. It became a childish thing. It was expensive. But like all fads, it was us that outgrew it. It didn't change, and still hasn't. Much like Zelda. These games are great. Haven't changed - we have. Maybe our reason for leaving Pokemon always left something to be desired, a need for a finality to it that was never reached.   Also, I heard an interesting story about a young woman with which we are all acquainted coming into an automobile incident with another driver who left the scene, going to a certain Saint Joseph's Medical Center wherein he lies bedridden for life. And by bedridden for life I mean he was treated and released. But still, Pammy... oops, you didn't here it from me. Now where's that backspace key? Hmm, looks like Matt Houle salvaged it or something. Anyways, this certain young woman crashed her car, probably worse than even Mattson ever has.  My brains kind of on drugs so... g'night.
