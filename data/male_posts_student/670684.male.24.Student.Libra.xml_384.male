It reminds me of Sharon, the stepmom from the mid-90s who wore hot orange sweaters and was quite gracious in her affection for others.  Large breasts.  Miniature intellect.  A con artist.  Who squeaked.    My memory of Sharon -- ugly yellow and white striped one-piece bathing suit, playing in the waves in Rosarito, Mexico.  Bouffant permanent.  Nasal voice.  Vinegar foot bath.  And a style reminiscent of early-90s 90210, a style we wanted to forget when it was still the in thing.    My question...it's been five years since I've seen her.  Yet I think she has the same style.  She'll always be dancing to that bad Breathe song, with the pastel flashes of synthetic happiness, and power cords resonant like slow death.
