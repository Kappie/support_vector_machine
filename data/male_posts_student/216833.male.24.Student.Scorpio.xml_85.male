There were wet spots on the floor where the leaks from the unit had dripped for weeks. I don't really know why it was extra hot today, maybe because there were a few ceiling tiles missing. Hot air from the warehouse must be making its way into the gym.   I am looking forward to this weekend. Another arcade auction on Saturday morning. I will try to attend a show this weekend, people seem upset. I'm also gonna help nick move into his new castle. Look it's wednesday and I am already looking towards the weekend.   I feel weird talking to my parents, something is different now and I don't like it.  Tomorrow, I get off at 4pm and I'm heading to the lake. This time, mimi will be along for the ride. That will help curb the weirdness of riding around in a baby-blue boat. I am so macho!! :)   current mood:  cheerful current music: jawbreaker
