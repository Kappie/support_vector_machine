Here's what I did the last 2 days:  Wednesday: Work from 12:00-9:00  Thursday: Work from 3:00-9:00  haha... my life is soooo exciting huh?........... I am slowly going crazy from all this work.  It's funny cuz I asked for more hours and now that I have em I'm complaining.  On top of that my back is sore, I haven't had as much time as usual for sc and now I have nothing interesting to write about im my blog.  Well... maybe not everything has changed >.  Hmm, I haven't played ball in almost a week.  I think I'll go before work at 4:oo today.  I wanted to go yesterday but I feel asleep on my bed after I decided to lay there for a sec.  LOL, I was awoken by my pool of drool.  Here's my song recommendation for the day:  Carl Thomas - My First Love   verse 1   Back in highschool,   I knew a girl like you,   She was heaven sent,   All the time we spend,   You kinda look like her,    I remember the way we were   Cause we were all in love,    I'm feeling you because...      chorus   You're 5.2, Brown eyes,   I don't know what to say,    You make me feel that way,   It seems like I'm dreaming,    I can't believe myself,   I found somebody else   You remind me of a girl that was my first love   I can't let you go   You're so sure like my first love      verse 2   Now I'm not letting go,   I think you need to know,   I'm not mad at you,    I've been through this before,   She got away somehow,    But that won't happen now,   No never again,   I finally found a friend...      chorus You're 5.2, Brown eyes, I don't know what to say, You make me feel that way, It seems like I'm dreaming, I can't believe myself, I found somebody else You remind me of a girl that was my first love I can't let you go You're so sure like my first love      bridge    I've been dreaming   Of someone like you   I had to pinch myself    Just to see if it's true   This is crazy   Just like deja-vu   I feel like I know you   This dream is so beautiful      chorus   You remind me of a girl that was my first love   I can't let you go    You're so sure like my first love (repeat 4x)     hehe... 5'2" brown eyes...
