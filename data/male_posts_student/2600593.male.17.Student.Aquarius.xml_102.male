      Me and  urlLink Justin  have got the Radio Station up, but there are some bugs to work out.  We are using Peer Cast, with WinAmp running as the DSP.  It is down right now, and we have some late nights ahead of us to get all the bugs work out.   Who would have though not even a couple years ago that two geeks will be running a Internet Radio station out of their bedrooms?
