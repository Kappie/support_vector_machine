And instead spent my money on a copy of Commandos 3 and a David Bowie album - both of which have been keeping my occupied through the afternoon.  During a conversation with someone doing similar work to me I found out what they had done... Lets just say there work will be better than mine will ever be and the other persons was far worse than anything I would ever admit to be mine!  Anyway there is a thunderstorm I want to watch so I'll be off now... Bye!
