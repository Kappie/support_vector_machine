Never let me go, I need you now More than I have ever needed you You are magnetizing, maneuver your way into my arms Hair is so fair, flawless and soft, I want you in my arms I know challenges await us, just wait for me, I will be at your every step Never leave me behind, I need you now More than ever before, more than I’ve ever needed you You look like you need me too But this detour is blocking my way I don’t want to find another way, you might be gone Will you still be there when I come home? When I come home  When I come home  When I come home  You are me, and I am you, tonight we are one I melt into you, you explore all of me, leave no place undiscovered I know regrets may come someday, but someway, I will help you through them Never let me go, I need you now More than you could ever know I need you
