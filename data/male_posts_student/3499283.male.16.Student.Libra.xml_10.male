I love the yearbooks this year, it really makes up for not getting one last year.  It makes me mad that I didn't make some good friends until the end of the year or the last half of the year. So much valuable time wasted because of shyness.  I glanced through my dad's old highschool yearbook the other day and some of the blurbs people wrote him are really funny and must bring back awesome memories.  I hope mine does the same.   The last day of regular school is tomorrow and the threat of finals I think has made us forget that tomorrow is the last day we're going to see everyone we regularly see.  :(  Ohhh but summer is way too close.  Today after school Chris, Raz and I went and played basketball outside in the pouring down rain and it was pretty fun. wet, but fun. We went barefoot and I think im getting blisters but it was worth it.      So far Pu and James G. and I are going to Mean Girls on Saturday night.. you know you want to come!   Cheers to yearbooks and friday  Peace    Chad
