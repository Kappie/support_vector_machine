Devils beat the Bruins (in Boston) 5-2 (Goals for Rasmussen, Niedermayer, Stevenson, Albelin, Elias).  That takes Elias' season goal count to 38, taking him to 4th in the lead with goals. He also got 2 assists. Albelin got his first goal of the season, which isn't so bad considering hes really old. Like, 40 or something. Brodeur made 38 saves as well, which rules.  This game takes the Devils to 100 points, and the 7th season running that they've hit the century. It also edges them above the Flyers, who lost to Ottawa yesterday. If the Devils win tomorrow's game at home to the Bruins, they'll go through as division champs, no matter what happens with the Philly game. Woohoo. Also, the Devils might end up facing Philly in the Eastern conference 1st round in the playoffs. That'd be interesting, non?
