And I got scolded again by Madam Phua. She is so damn pissed as I did not have my Design and Technology materials. So, I had a very fun time cleaning the Design and Technology lab. It was quite fun though. I get to take any materials that were lying around the floor. But, luckily I did not get caught by Mdm Phua. Mdm Phua is a bitch. Just because she is pregnant, she thinks that she can show us attitude. Anyway, I am quite pissed with that f***ed up attitude of hers. I always had this temptation to kick that f***ing belly of hers and make her have a miscarriage. Design and Tech can be a fun subject, but, school teachers make the subject boring. I don't really know what is wrong with all the teachers. They think that because I had a very bad record last year, I won't change this year. They keep thinking that I am the boy I was last year, but infact, I am trying to change, bit by bit. Anyway, no one cares if I change or not.    In school, everyone is starting to hate A-maths. It's not because of the subject, but because of the teacher. We have one hell of a slacker for a teacher. He doesn't even know how to teach. That explains the number of failures for this year's mid year exams. The teacher, Mr. Soh, is also the Head Of Department for maths. No one knows how a slacker like him can get into such a high paying rank. He is not fit to teach. He insults almost everyone for no reason. He thinks he is perfect. And, he is damn racist. I think the racial harmony shit didn't get to him. He is on f***ing son-of-a-b****. Now, Marco, Wei Min, Khai Wah and Ernest Lee wants to drop A-maths to take Principals of Accounts. All because of the screwed up teacher. If only we could do something about that son-of-a-b****. Everyone hopes that he gets sacked from teaching. Too bad we can't do anything as he is the Head of Department for maths. Which means, he is in charge of all the maths stuff in my school. That includes tests, exams, worksheets, etc.    I've decided to make a few resolutions. As I think that I really need to change for the better.  My Resolutions:  Refrain from using too much vulgaities. Use only in emergencies.  Save at least $2 a day. So that I can use the money I save to buy certain stuff.  Talk lesser everyday. Talking lesser won't kill.  Stop imitating teachers. Imitating teachers get me into trouble.  Control my anger. Controlling my anger helps me alot by not getting me into trouble
