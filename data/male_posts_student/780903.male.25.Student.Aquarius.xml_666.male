And... a short song parody inspired by the myths more than the reality of these interviews:  (To the tune of "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow")  Oh, you say the work will be delighting That the cases will be exciting But you'll be chaining me to the floor Pay me more, pay me more, pay me more  Oh, you want me to work these long hours Give up interests, sleep, and showers Trade my wife in for a whore Pay me more, pay me more, pay me more  When I finally get to go Will I see that my life's gone away? So to not make me see that, I know That I'll have no choice but to stay  Oh, in forty years I could be wealthy And besides the 6 heart attacks, healthy But I might have turned into a bore Pay me more, pay me more, pay me more
