       
       ePrompter is an email retrieval and notification utility that automatically checks eight email accounts for AOL, AltaVista, Earthlink, Email.com, Hotmail, Juno, Lycos, Mail.com, Mindspring, MSN, Netscape, POP3, Rediffmail, USA, Yahoo, ZDNetOneBox and hundreds of other email domains - all at the same time, featuring a unique screensaver and a rotating tray icon that let you know at a glance the current status of your selected email accounts, whether your computer is online or offline.   Though I don't use it myself, I've heard it's a good program. Used it a lttle while, but my computer only has 128mb of RAM and couldn't handle it. With everything else I run.... that shouldn't be a problem for you though.  You can dowload this latest beta  urlLink here .
