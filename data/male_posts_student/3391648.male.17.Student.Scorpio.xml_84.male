Ms Forster however still maintains her opposition to widespread free speech at PHSC. We may not put up posters unless they first come through Ms Farrel and then Ms Ford. They must be of the form of public notices and will only be limitedly put up. We as students should have the right to put up posters with out going through this political process.  The reason why this is not possible according to Ms Forster is that some teachers have complained. An unnamed teacher said: 'We should hunt them down and beat them up'  or words to this effect i support this notion put forward by this anonymous teacher of North American extraction.
