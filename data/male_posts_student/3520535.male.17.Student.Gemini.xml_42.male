A nation that was brought to it's knees in order that they may be considered free. Now that their infrastructure has been broken, their country torn by conflict, a growing insurgency, and a large segment of the population thrown out of work by the US' decision to disband the Iraqi Army (thank you Mr. Bremer) the citizenry of the Republic of Iraq can now fully taste the freedom that they lacked when their electricity worked, when their husbands in the army had a pension to look forward to.  Tell me, because I'm interested in knowing, what freedom of religion do a people have who lack everyday necessities for life?  The reason why invading Iraq was a BAD idea was that no one has won. Our military should be used, as Bush has said and not believed, to fight and win wars, not to nation build. Not to police the world, but to protect the safety of a sovereign nation (that would be ours, not that of Iraq or any other). I feel much safer having thousands of Iraqis considering my country to be a nation of conquerors.  Our intelligence community has had it's reputation badly tarnished, see the recent congressional investigation. More people hate us. Our military force is so badly stretched that we are considering keeping soldiers in combat whose tours are already up. This distracts us from our debacles in Afghanistan where we still have accomplished little and need more manpower. Our international credibility is increasingly fragile where it isn't shattered beyond repair (See: NO WMD! and invading a country against the wishes of the UN for violating UN sanctions - (but not really doing that it turns out))  So yes, Rebekah, I have heard of sacrifice. People sacrifice all of the time. But sacrifice isn't what's going on now. Sacrifice is FOR something, not a sad political maneuver, or a personal vendetta.  The decision to invade Iraq was based on faulty evidence, the reasons changed while Americans were dying, the invasion left a shattered Iraq that may or may not be able to become a true democracy, it has been divisive domestically and a foreign relationâ€™s disaster, all the while making the United States Military a less effective defense against foreign aggression.  I pray that God have mercy on us for these actions, because our children will not.  I'll leave your interpretation of US foreign policy since WWII for a later date.
