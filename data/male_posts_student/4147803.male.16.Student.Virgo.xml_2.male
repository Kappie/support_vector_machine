I love people to get hanga me and bloggin is the best way to do so. I heard a lot about it in my new school DPS and was keen to give net bloggin a good shot. Yes ! I have joined DPS RK Puram after passing X from St. Xavier's with "fly(dy) ing "colours. I got into this school because I had heard a lot about its stupendous faculty, results, competitive spirits and Blah blah !! This school has 8K odd students. It is a huge school with many blocks which are perfectly crammed and is pandemonium of a place. On the other hand, St. Xavier's had unparalleled beauty. Its campus was huge and picturesque.  It's been a month since i joined it and feel that i was lucky to get into this school. I feel so because DPS has some kewl features - Least discipline , cell phones allowed , bunking's the child's play et al. The reasons why I feel lucky have just been said but why do my parents feel lucky ?? Well, the answer is da most expected i.e The skool has study-ish atmosphere and students have hell of competitive spirits despite absence of discipline. Sounds boring and "corny", ain't it ????
