Some show genuine concern, some total disregard, some utter incompetence.  I just stopped to stare at my lava lamp. I haven't turned it on in ages. It's blue. It makes funny shapes as it melts. Almost looks like a fetus sometimes. Intriguing.  You know what I wanna do? I wanna go lie down in a field on a breezy day. It's funny how your mind makes you see figures in the clouds. First it's a squid, then it's a sailboat, then it's an aeroplane. What's cool is that your mind does it. Squid and sailboat are related by the sea. The boat and plane, by modes of transportation. What the hell am I talking about?  The lava's messy now. I feel like I'm losing the complexity of my mind. Becoming.. "Normal" UrgGhH!  I miss Zel. Going to school tomorrow to meet the boys. Hopefully I'll see her. I miss Zel. Oh, I've said that already. Goodnight.
