The venue was a converted retail space in the middle of Brantford's deserted downtown. The stage was setup in front of the storefront and from behind the performers you could see this street scene straight out of the 50's with Kerby's Barbershop, the Maytag Refridgerator Emporiom and a run down T.V. repair shop all plastered with For Sale/Lease signs.  The delicate harmony and slowly building melodies of the Wooley Leaves was the perfect way to start the evening. As day turn to night out in the abandoned street, things started to pick up inside with spirited sets from Nathan Lawr and the Fembots.  I have seen Jim Guthrie in Toronto at a packed club with more than a thousand people looking on, but Friday was different. All the little punk rock kids that had packed the Constantines show the previous night were nowhere to be seen. It was probably the most chill perfomance I have seen and definitely one of the best. There was enough room that half the audience was able to sit cross legged on the floor and just enjoy the spectacular show Jim and his band put on.
