The thing was that I waited and waited expecting Sweden to get thrashed but nothing.  For 120mins including extra time, no one scored. Just to say, as you know Stam is my favourite player of all time he had two shots at goal including a run from halfway and took a fantastic shot at goal outside the box. As a result, it went into penalties. From previous history, Holland had lost to penalties and pressure was on them. 5 shots each were taken, all in apart from Cocu's and a Swedish. To top it off, Robben put the icing on the cake with his match scoring shot at goal with started a mass of cheering.  Even though the penalties was a 50/50 outcome...I knew that Holland would win.
