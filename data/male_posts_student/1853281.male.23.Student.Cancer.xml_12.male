Downside, i had to go to school. I love the whole laying in bed staring at the cieling not being asleep at 2:00 in the morning thing i've got going. Give me some speed and a toothbrush, and there would be no dirty grout in the metro area. time to go home, Maybe some of the books i ordered from amazon(which has now made me her bitch) will have arrived. cheers devin
