Among these movies were   urlLink Lost in Translation   and   urlLink American Splendor  , both of which Nate ripped off of the internet.   Lost in Translation , with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, is about two people who meet each other while in Tokyo, and fall into conversation and a close friendship. They're both lost in a foreign country, as well as in their marriages and careers, which is the basis for the story. The movie is full of awkward comedy, and covers issues which everyone can relate to. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were great in it and, of course, Zach was first to insert how beautiful Scarlett Johansson is...  The second movie,  American Splendor , tells the true story of Harvey Pekar, a file clerk who turned his everyday life into a successful comic book. The comics are genuine and funny simply because they show that we all fight daily battles. The movie deals not only with real and fictional characters, but even with the way they are presented. There are documentary scenes, fictional scenes, and then scenes illustrated as comic books, with the drawings sometimes moving into reality or back again. This was definitely one of the most unique movies, in terms of presentation, I have seen lately.
