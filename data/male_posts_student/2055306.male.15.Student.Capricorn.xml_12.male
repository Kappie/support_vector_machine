Yeah things will get rough, but look at all the joy you'll have! It will def outway the bad Caleb, for sure. Keep searching for Gods will, and I pray that you learn something new about God, and about leadership everyday. You know I love you and I'm so glad you are willing to just get up and follow God no matter what.
