First, I'll discuss the animal cruelty and harsh conditions that our cows live through on factory-farms.  Female cows are first artificially inseminated right after their first birthdays.  Cows customarily lactate (produce milk) for ten months after birthing.  After these ten months are through, the cows are artificially inseminated again, in a cycle which ends once a cow is about 4 or 5 years old, at which point they are sent to the slaughter house to feed our nation's need for beef.  The lifespan of a cow is 25 years, with 9 of these years maintaining the ability to produce milk.  However, cows at factory-farms never reach this 9th year due to the conditions, which lead to disease, lameness, and reproductive problems that render te cows worthless to the dairy industry.  What happens to the calves?  The calves are taken from their mother's after only 1 day and are fed "milk-replacers", which include cattle blood so that we can take the milk instead of the calves.  How about some statistics?  There are approximately 9 million ows living on farms in the U.S. today, compared to 22 million in 1950.  In contrast to those figures, where 116 billion pounds of milk were produced nationwide in 1950, 170 million pounds of milk are produced nationwide every year today.  How is this possible?  Well, as a result of genetic manipulation, antibiotics, and hormones, instead of an average cow producing approximately 16 pounds of milk per day, your average cow presently produces 50 pounds of milk per day--not to mention the high-protein diets fed to cows, which consist of dead chickens, pigs, and other farm animals, because a measly diet of grass would not provide the nutrients necessary to produce such abnorminally large amounts of milk.   Want to learn something new?  There's a major problem amongst cow herds throughout the nation.  It's called mastitis.  It is a painful inflammation of the mammary glands.  It can be caused by about 150 different types of bacteria, including E. coli.  The method of detecting the infection is by inspecting the somatic cell count (SCC).  Somatic cells are white blood cells and skin cells that line the inside of a cow's udder.  For normal milk, the SCC is below 100,000 cells per milliliter.  However, factory-farms have found a loophole in the system to feed America bad milk.  They are allowed to combine milk from several cows in a herd into what is called a "bulk tank" somatic cell count.  In other words, they combine a lot of milk, some good milk, some bad milk, and they manage to stay within a so-called healthy level of milk with a BTSCC (bulk-tant somatic cell count) of 750,000 cells per milliliter.  A BTSCC of 700,000 or more indicated that 2/3's of the herd are infected.  It has been proven that housing cows in cleaner environments with more space, and better diets, and care lowers the SCC count of thier milk and thier incidence of masitis.   Like veal?  Where female calves are either slughtered or made into milk-makers, male calves are raised for veal.  Thy are chained in tiny stalls for about 18 weeks and are fed a milk substitute designed to make them gain 2 pounds per day.  Their diet is low in iron on purpose to induce anemia and maintain their flesh a pale color.  Calves being raised for veal normally suffer from diarrhea, pneumonia, and lameness.  And now for the factors concerning our health.  We are the only species that drinks milk beyond infancy, furthermore, we are also the only species that drinks  another species' milk.  Cow's milk is meant for calves, human infants don't have 4 stomachs and don't customarily gain hundred's of pounds in a matter of months after birth.  Cow's milk also contains three times as much protein as human milk.  Humans begin producing less and less lactase (the enzyme that helps to digest milk) after the age of 2.  Millions of Americans are lactose-intolerant, as well as 75% of Native and African-Americans and 90% of Asian-Americans.   They are two major myths associated with milk, one involves calcium and the other involves protein.  American women consume whopping amounts of calcium, yet the rates of osteoperosis amongst American women are of the highest in the world.  On the other hand, Chinese woman, who consume about half that amount of protein, and this consumption is mostly from plant-sources, have a miniscule incidence of osteoperosis.  "A Harvard Nursesâ€™ Study of more than 77,000 women aged 34 to 59 found that those who consumed two or more glasses of milk per day had higher risks of broken hips and arms than those who drank one glass or less per day." (PETA, 2003)  "T. Colin Campbell, professor of nutritional biochemistry at Cornell University, said, 'The association between the intake of animal protein and fracture rates appears to be as strong as that between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.'"  Protein deficiency is hardly a problem at all in the U.S.  It is only an issue in famine-stricken countries.  The excessive intake of protein from dairy, eggs, and meat is linked to kidney stones and is associated with cancer of the colon and liver.    The answer?  Drink soy-milk, and eat soy-products.  It has all the calcium you need along with vitamins, iron, zinc, and protein, and without the cholesterol!  Vegetarianism and veganism means the protection of your life and that of animals.
