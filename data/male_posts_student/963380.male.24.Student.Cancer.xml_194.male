Bingo: The Chronicles of Riddick - which, you may be surprised to learn (or not, if you know me at all) I enjoyed. I'm sure that tomorrow morning I'm going to hear it disparaged to the max by P to the Rizzo as it probably didn't contain nearly enough "Art" or "German Expressionism" or some shit that makes a movie incomprehensibly boring whilst similiarly devoid of intellectual stimulation.  To place the Riddickles, as I have come to know them in their proper context in the heirarchy of film I will now elaborate on my popcorn theory.  The popcorn theory is as follows: Should an entire bag of popcorn, when combined with a form of fusion, fail to distract me from the film either through the process of consumption or digestion it is A) a small bag = a film B) a medium bag = a movie or C) a mammoth fucking container dwarfing the very planet which birthed it = a flick.  The Riddickles falls happily and heavily in the category of flick. Were there bad moments? Sure. The option to fade the sounds of asskicking out to music in a certain scene was ill advised and generall disapointing. Did they at all reduce my enjoyment of the flick? Negatory good buddy.  Vinny whups a lot of ass. As an actor, he's built for asswhupping. That's not to say he doesn't have some depth (There are moments here, but if you're interested, check out Boiler Room). But frankly, he really should keep punching, slicing and well, whupping. It makes us happy precious.  I shall tune back in later in the week (well Tuesday) with what the animated Riddickle is like. As soon as I get a chance to play the videogame Riddickle, I'll get back to you on that one too.  If you're looking for a decent place to chuck your buck this weekend - Find somewhere playing your Riddickles. You'll thank me.
