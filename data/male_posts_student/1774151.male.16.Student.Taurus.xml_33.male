Johns going with bethany which im sure bethany will not regret or anything............hah....ha.....yea. hahahha w/e she seemed pretty damn happy that he said yes and then ran away to his carpool. theme of prom: manhattan 1920s. prohibition. sounds kinda stupid since you cant have any moonshine related props. w/e the gangster aspect has quite a bit of potential. maybe i should bring my tommy-gun with me...damn it would be sweet to have one of those. anyway...righto....liddle more than a month til the rush concert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ive been reading up on some of the cds and my interest has been piqued. im probly gonna check out their sucky 80s and 90s music just to see whats up with em.
