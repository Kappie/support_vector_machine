So I'm headed BACK to Atlanta AGAIN this evening....sometimes I think I should have just spent the summer there....but the money I'm making is okay....  Man....life is becoming Grand Theft Auto for real....I couldn't believe what I read on  urlLink Beth's blog  this morning....dude was on a MISSION....that is some wild ish....  I am going to succumb to impulse buying very soon and get the digital camera that I have wanted for almost 3 years now....yep....I have a spending problem.....cuz this Banana Republic bill is staring me in the face and I'm going to pay the MINIMUM...(why do I like typing words in CAPS to MAKE A POINT....heh heh heh....I amuse myself)  Anyways the only thing I can think about is getting in a jacuzzi at some point this weekend....I worry about my future....
