Yes, we had to do a lot of line integrals and a lot of Green's theorem (which, by the way, for those of you who were wondering does  not  have an extra E at the end).  Here's the Unger Computing Center, where I took the test:      And here's the view I had upon leaving:      And this is what I looked like, immediately after being released from the above building:       As you can see, it was an exciting day.  I'm now going to cram as much information about probability as I can into my head: I've got my last exam tomorrow!  Then I'll be free for like 6 days, at which point I'll be returning to the daily grind of PHY205.  Okay, so Marcia just called to make sure that I had the poster boards that Jose didn't use for the Big Meeting decorations.  They cost $.77 each, and I think I have three of them.  So I've got to go return them and get a full refund!
