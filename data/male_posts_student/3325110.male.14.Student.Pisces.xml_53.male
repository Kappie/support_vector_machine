But one day, his mom robbed Fort Knox, and payed for a complex surgery, giving her little boy a body. So when he was ready, he asked "Mommy, can I go play with the other kids?" The mother said yes. So the child walked out the door, and got hit by a car. So I guess the moral of the story here is "Quit while you're a head".
