A creative publicist was walking by him and stopped to observe. The blind man only had a few coins in his hat, he dropped a few more coins in his hat and without asking for his permission took the sign, turned it around, and wrote another announcement. He placed the sign by his feet and left.  That afternoon the creative publicist returned by the blind man and noticed that his hat was full of bills and coins. The blind man recognized his footsteps and asked if it was him who had re-written his sign and he wanted to know what did he write on it? The publicist responded: Nothing that was not true, I just rewrote your sign differently". He smiled and went on his way.  The blind man never knew, but his new sign read : "TODAY IS SPRING AND I CANNOT SEE IT ".  Change your strategy when something does not go your way and you'll see it will probably be for the best. Have faith that every change is best for our lives. Put your heart, mind, intellect and soul even to your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.   God Bless!!!
