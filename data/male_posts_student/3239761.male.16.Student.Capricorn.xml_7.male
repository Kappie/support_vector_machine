I went to work with dad and helped build a pool for some rich old woman who doesn't need it. She does have a lot of old junk in this antique barn, most from the 50s and also some old farm equipment. Then I drove home, did farm work, and here I am. Back in my own little sanctuary, where there is no world outside of these four walls, well six if the closet counts. Sitting here on this bed, typing a blog that no one will read, adding to the already growing internet pollution sitting on servers around the globe. This post will probably go to some server in Los Angeles or maybe in Hong Kong, where it will be stored for all eternity, or at least for 400 years until the magnetic disk on the hard drive slowly degrades bit by byte by sector, and it will be gone forever, having no meaning except to fill a void and make the day not so boring after all.
