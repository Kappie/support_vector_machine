Then we were talking about stuff, and the subject went to dating. Some girl in my group - which i didn't really like - was asking me if i wanted to date her (wouldn't ever happen in real life, but meh), and i was saying that i wanted to have my first date special, or something like that. She seemed insulted, and i tried to apologize. And then i was saying that it wasn't really my first date, as i went on a "mock date" with that girl i used to like. And they were surprised - in a bad way for me ^^;;   Anyways, we eventually came to this really, really big school. We all went through a metal detector. I was in a classroom, and was talking to joe's crush. Then, I went through the school looking for joe, and eventually found him. I brought him to the room that she was in, and thought for a sec that he wouldn't want to go (was thinking real-life-ly). Anyways, i brought her to joe - since she was just standing/sitting (forget which) there. She seem apologetic (probably because of previously). Both of them seemed happy, so i was kinda happy for them ^^
