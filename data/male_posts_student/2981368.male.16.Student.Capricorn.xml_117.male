Generally I'd plug one in and the others would mysteriously stop working. 3) Watching RotK again and again. Then watching the DVD of that football match waaaay back on September 1st 2001. Where England beat Germany 5-1 in Munich? Talk about obscure. Other titles on the list I could get via an uncle include:  - "Teach yourself TKD" - Wow, now I can be just like Sam *pffft* - "Explore Americas National Parks" - Completely pointless. "ONLY YOU CAN STOP FOREST FIRES!" - "England v Germany 1966" - One I'm actually considering getting. - "Windows tutorials - 6 disc set" - ....why?!?! - "Barbies Nutcracker" - According to uncie, that hyper cousin of mine who enjoys punching people in the groin likes watching this - "Balamory" - I had to sit through 4 whole mind-numbing episodes of this over the weekend. Talk about living hell.  Oh, and its the last day of study leave. Bah.
