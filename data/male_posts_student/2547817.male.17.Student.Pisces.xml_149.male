Oh, but the terrible singer girl is getting better. :)  Anyway, we went to orchard where I refused to see spiderman again. Instead, I fruitfully utilized my time by taking Angeline and Megan to Paragon to get their eyebrows plucked. It was entertaining- watching Megan's pretty face cringe to resemble a hamster cleaning itself and Angeline jump with shock. Conclusively, they were "happy".  Yap and Angeline came over and we played with the new amps and stuff. Walked her to get her mail from her place and then back again. I enjoy her company and we had peanut butter waffles.  Later Leon asked me to go over to his place so that we could go for dinner at Holland V. I got mama (uncle) to send me to Leon's. Brought along his police sign present. Remember the one that I picked up with Dawn a couple of months ago. It wobbled making metallic wobbling noises which sent Fonzie (the Golden Retriever) into a "woah-what's-that-noise" mode. His head was moving in the oddest fashion and his ears picked up and his face almost asked you a question! Hahaha! He was so cute! Fonzie has motion sickness you see, so in the car, I was trying to keep him from puking by attempting to keep him entertained. I did many silly things which I will not mention here. In the end he didn't puke, I reached Leon's and all was well.  Gave Leon the gift and was thanked with smirk and an "ass". Haha! We went to Brekos where he entertained me with his stories of the commonwealth man. And there was this malay kid with the biggest eyes! I love him! We bought corona and left. We talked, toasted and um.. I can't think of another verb that starts with "T" right now.  I'm tired. Good night.
