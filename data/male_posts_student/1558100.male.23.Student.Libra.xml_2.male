But they're cheap, baggy, and look good with a black leather belt. Camo pants, you're alright.  You may be able to see the gastronomic disaster Jonno at the other night. Not cool, not cool at all. A combination of Renee, Craig, Yarran and Jonno  does not  result in fine dining, apparently. Ugh. I've seen some of the other photos he took, though, and apparently all had a fun time. Yeah! Batman and everything! Yeah! ... Here's a haiku for the post.  Batman can't save me, I put myself in this state, I'll get out myself.
