I've realised long ago that prayer is more than just words, its more than just about petitions and a listing of intentions. Prayer requires a heart, and without that heart, prayer by itself has no meaning. I've been praying for an intention for the past two years or so, but i've realised that everytime, i've only suceeded at listing the intention before God. I've not put any real meaning into it. My faltering faith isn't enough to actually sustain it. Perhaps that is why i haven't seen God tend to it. I ask that God, in his mercy and saving grace, will so generously grant me that faith i need to go back to him, back to prayer and communion with him.  "God, please forgive me for not praying with a heart, for treating you as a servant each time i leave my unhappiness before you, with the mentality that you are obliged to turn them into joy. I ask that you Lord, give me the faith i need to serve you in everyway i can, and that i will see you Jesus, in every person whom i know. Amen."
