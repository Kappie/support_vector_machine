I was driving today and someone stopped short so I slammed on the brakes to avoid an accident. Of course this makes me a bad driver (or at least to my mom) so now she decides not to teach me anymore well you know what, UP YOURS! Then later Were in our local Marc's grocery store and my sister is running her mouth like a gosh darn retard so I say "Close your mouth before you lose it" obviously meaning shut up or I'll cut your lips off. To which my mother replys "Do what you have to, but get your anger under control". Now don't get me wrong these wern't the only reason I blew up, but driving with my mother is hell on earth and being in the mall (one of my least favorite places) didn't help. God I just want to murder everyone who ever said "Get control of your anger" you don't know me you don't know my situation. So "judge not lest ye be". Also remember you heathens repent for the end is near.
