They'll have to bring down the prices of handheld DVD players if they want to keep them competitive due to the fact you can have a game system with it with the PS2. That's what I thought anyway.  The Village comes out Friday! Yay. Haven't decided if I want to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle yet.
