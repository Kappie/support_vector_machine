Sigh...I wanted to play The Sims de...but somehow, I didn't. Ergh....  Today sure was bad luck. I have severe diarrhea! Hurts so much! For the past 7 hours, I went to the toilet 6 times! That's roughly about once per hour. It's so like annoying.... and hurtful. The pain around the stomach. The number of times I have to rush to the toilet. Why, I could even make the toilet my permanent home. Ergh! What could have ignited this terrible fire? I think it's the fried carrot cake I ate this morning for breakfast.... How idiotic!  Today, the poor YJCians have to go for Orientation till 9pm. Poor things! They have to suffer so many hours of ultimate boredom. I pity them! (However, I do not pity a particular Ah Ji-insulting duck there. Serve you right, left and center!) I must find out what they did. HaHa!  I am now playing one the CDs I burnt at Wendy's house. HaHa. At Saturdays from 8-10, there's this program on Perfect 10, Club Beats. I don't like it, as they mainly play club music, and I don't like club music. Therefore, I played my CDs lor. It's now playing Bon Jovi's It's My Life. HaHa!  I think I end le la.... See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
