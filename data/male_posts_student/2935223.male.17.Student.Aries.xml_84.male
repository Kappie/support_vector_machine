Each intended for a different person.Never tell which one is to whom," thing, but, I got to the first one and and went: " OH CRAP! " I'm not very subtle, I would have  NO  idea whom to write about, and I would feel bad about it later. "It's in the past." This sentence is a 100% piece of  BULLSHIT . Just thought I'd say that. As long as I still have memories( damn them ) nothing will truly be "in the past," because it will still be fresh in my mind. So many things I have just tried to flick off and say "It's in the past, There's nothing I can do." Yes, it may be true, but, I will still regret it or think about it or any other emotion that comes with remembrence. "Just move on." That sentence is pretty crappy, too.  Dang, now I'm in a self-pitying/depressed mood. ************************************************************************** What did I do today? I woke up around noon. Got UBER-bored. Remembered that Brittany was goin' to Minneapolis at 2. Decided to call her and see if that was still happenin'. Her, Tina, an Kathleen were all at Perkins. So I decided to go over there, because they told me to.  I was playing with the lines, and they were laughing at me. Then Tina's mom came in, when Tina was supposed to be at her dad's....and I got the  LAST  laugh. Then Brittany drove me home to change outfits. I did. Then we all went over to Tina's dad's house and watched a really funny movie. Left there and went to ShopKo, where we hung out for like 1/2 an hour. All the girls bought sumthing, but Ervin and I didn't. We're cheap/poor.  :-D  Then we went to Tina's mom's house and dropped off Tina so she could go to Glen Park and take pictures with Rachel or sumthin'. We hung around outside her house for like 1/2 an hour, after she was already gone, eatin' J-e-l-l-o.  It's ALIVE!!!!  Then Brittany brought me home, and we pulled in right behind my dad, and I quick dashed inside and stated that I was home before he got home. Hung out and took a shower and ate sum dinner. Waited for Brittany to come pick me up, which never happened. We were waitin' for Kathleen to get home, so we could go to Minneapolis and get a new buddha for Brittany's car. Instead, I just ended up going bowling with Molly, Kathleen, and Ervin. Which was uber-fun. My second game was WAY better then my first game. I won the second one, but lost the first one.....uberly! Then afterwards we went to Applebees, where we sat and ate. It was nice. I felt*and still feel* uber guilty for making Kathleen and Molly pay though..... :-( *BAD SPENSER* Then we went back and sat outside Kathleens' house for like an hour or sumthin'.  I'm tired now...I think I will retire to my bedroom chamber.  Spense
