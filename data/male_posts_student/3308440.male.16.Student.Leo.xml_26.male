Now he is screaming so I will delete him... bye bye  Anyway more football today with:   Croatia v Switzerland   England v France   Oh by the way sorry if I am going on a bit about football and you do not like it do not worry there is only another 27 more games in the tournament after these.  See Ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Nickelback - Hero
