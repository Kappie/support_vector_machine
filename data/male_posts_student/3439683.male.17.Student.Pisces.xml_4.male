Why do I feel this way?  I am stumbling in the dark, Lord.  You say You have a plan, oh God  I lean on that promise, my Lord,  But it’s harder as time goes on.   But what do I know? Maybe my tears have no point.  Maybe it’s my fault, brought on me by myself.  I don’t deserve it, this thing I ask for.  I should not hope at all for it, futile it is.   (bridge) Sad story unread, thoughts filling my head  Alone in this world, never given a thought  Few of them care, their happy eyes are blind  They torment my heart, but for my hope, I still live   Written 12/11/03
