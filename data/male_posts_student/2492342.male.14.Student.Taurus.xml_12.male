But had good food at the shakespear club party. and sable gave me this crad saying she appreciated me joining the club, so i couldnt quit. damn.   I had lots to say. Oh well. I'm too tired to write all the screwed up thoughts I hought of today but here's a taste- heckling Bush, bombing a humvee, wearing a green hexbollah headband, crying, dieing, sleeping, running to texas, making myself sick, etc.   Leilas sick..and so is June. so we might not go to Mammoth. hopefully, i wanna stay with aisha. but going there would be refreshing. Oh well, let what may come, come.  I got on the computer to fnd some weird techno aol screen and buddy lsit. weird people, the yfroze my computer a few times. My computers too slow for good graphics, not that I want them- all this technology is more stuff i dont need.  Saddam...they didnt provide any DNA evidence. I know im not alone in thinking its a look alike(AQSA group unite! lol), but no one at school cares so ill keep to myself about it. But still, we live in an age of technology where almost every court trial has some DNA testing...for blood, for robbery, for everyhting- so why didnt they do any of it? He had so many look alikes..anyways.  AIshas b-day was monday! i sent her 2 e-cards. hat kind of crap am i? I cant give decent gifts anymore. Even if I couldnt get her somehting real, at least something better than that. I wish...  dad came in. that scared me to detah. right...  GOOD NIGHT! Much love and peace  ~alex
