Spent the morning shopping for groceries for mom as i did not help her yesterday. Omg she had to choose today to buy the rice. It was 10 kg and i had to carry it home, not to mention tt i oso had to carry the canned food which were oso very heavy. Reached home very tired, abandoned my plan to go for a morning swim. I still dun understan why she won't get dad to go with her. Dad had a car so he could just dump all the stuff into the boot and drive home. But everytime she just igores my grubbles by sayin dad's tired or busy. Like i'm nv tired or busy.......   Went to hougang mall to have lunch as mom was cookin too slow and i has to teach steph today. Took a mrt to the place we were suppose to meet. Boarded the train and sat down, called edmund only to find out he was oso at kovan mrt which was my next mrt stop. We were both heading the same direction so i figured we could meet on the train. The train stopped at kovan n to my surprise i met lulu be4 i even saw edmund. Apparently both of them were headed towards PS.Met edmund next, all three of us best pals were chatting on the train until my stop came and i alighted. I went to the control station where i was suppose to meet steph. Couldn't see her anywhere so i checked my fone to find i was 15min early. Was bored and i started walkin around the station cuz the there is this officer who's checkin ppl's bag at area near the control station and he was lookin at mi as though i was carryin a bomb or wat. Went into the shop inside the mrt station, forgot whether it was guardian or watson or watever. Brought somethings to eat to pass my time. Waited and waited, i got a little scared tt i got the wrong meetin place and starting wandering around the station lookin for steph. I guess it's not only unconvienient for a person not to have a hp but oso unconvienient for their frens.  Finally when i returned to the control station i saw steph and she was lookin so nerdy i almost can''t help laugh.... (sry steph if ur reading this but u really looked nerdy) She was carryin this big adidas bag and in her hand were the yellow book and the math textbook. I guess it's my fault cuz i told her to bring watever she could. Hmmm now i feel really guilty bout it. So sry .... Anyway she was also gettin worried tt i got the wrong meetin place. Anyway we walked to a nearby mac and started studying. Taught her organic chem, a little CEP , a little math (realli A LITTLE) and the labreport. She actually realli smart, she can understan concepts so easily. I'm realli worried tt i'm a lousy teacher or wat but i guessed she made mi look good. I so worried tt she did not understan wat i'm sayin but she just faked tt she noe so tt i wont feel bad.Anyway finish teachin her and went home. Suppose to be going go somewhere with edmund but i was realli tired and wanted to rest. Guessed it was quite sometime ago tt i realli had to worked my brain so hard. Well nothing much to do for the sat nite so i guess i gonna surf a while and turn in a little later. -bye-  Edmund - tmr go out leh, sry today cannot go out, got thing wat.... Best pals Steph - So today i teach u the things got any use??? hope tt i was able to help lulu - long time nv comment liao, muz comment k ??? but dun be like edmund ... so vulgar.
