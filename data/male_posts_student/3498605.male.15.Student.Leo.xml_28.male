Actually, I did pretty good on that final, I got a 84%! Then I had my Intro. to Business final. Easiest final ever. I literally finished within 30min. After that was lunch, which was fun, but boring. Finally, I had my Honors Biology final. I thought that was going to be my hardest final. I was very suprised by that final. It was exceptionally easy, and I finished 155 multiple choice/true,false/matching, plus 2 written esays in about 45min. It was also suprising because I didn't study for more than a minute for that final, yet, I found it to be REALLY easy. I just can't wait to see what I got on it. Although, I am REALLY pissed at my geometry teacher. I hate him even more now than I previously had. Basically, I took my geometry final the first day of finals. Now, it is the last day of school and this dumbsh*t still doesn't have the grades posted! I mean, WTF. That is really the only final grade I was worried about. AGHHHHH! Anyways, summer starts today! I am soooooooooooooo happy!  later, bradleyJ
