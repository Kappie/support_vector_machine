They tell us that Halo 2 will be out at such a time, then delay it, then it'll be released in such a month, then they delay it again. They just keep raising people's hopes, then shooting them down. After a while, you just don't give a s***. You certainly won't find me drooling over  Half-Life 2  or  Halo 2  until they're coming out in a week's time.  Publishers should take a leaf out of J.K. Rowling's book. The  Harry Potter  books are  never  given a release date until about a month before launch. Sure, we wait a couple of years or more to get our hands on each book, but it's not an anticlimax and we never had our hopes up regarding the release date. It's like, "Next month? So soon?! I'll pre-order right now!". With  Halo 2  it'll be, "Yeah, I suppose I should go and get a copy, it might be an alright game". Moving around release dates takes all the fun out of waiting for stuff. So publishers, be vague and don't keep letting us down!
