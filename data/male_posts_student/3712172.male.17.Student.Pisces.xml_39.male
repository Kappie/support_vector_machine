I was looking through blogs out of boredness, and came across a post that honestly, even though I shouldn't care, insulted me greatly. Entitled "Fuck You Canada", it posessed a meaningless point in my eyes, and it was very rude and arrogant. And to that I seriously take offense.  urlLink Read It  Anyways, it's not something completely major, but it seriously shows the mentality and common sense of the world. Based on a complete stipulation / statistic this individual runs his opinion about how "Canadians Hate Americans" and how it's made to seem that "America is the most generous country". I wasn't aware I hated Americans, and that half of Canada did. The last time I checked I am pretty sure I had family in the USA, and plenty of people I know do as well. It just honestly makes me upset at the fact that an insulting phrase like "Fuck You Canada" can be based on such vile information.   The other thing that gets me is that, out of all countries, why Canada? Canada should be the least of the USA's worries. Specially when it comes to hating one another. I do believe a lot of Canadians have opinions about not supporting this whole war situation in Iraq, but how can we possibly hate the citizen's of America? I am sure there are plenty of Americans already who don't support this war that has no point to it, why should that be a bad thing? We live in a fucking democracy, we can think what we want, which is fine (I am not trying to be hypocritical) But before thinking, think long and hard that what your actually thinking has some sense and meaning to it.  And believe it or not, not all Americans get along either, as well as Canadians. Everyone has a different opinion so before one is meaninglessly overrated, think twice and find out information for yourself. I could make a poll right now saying that "statisically speaking" Americans hate Canadians, post it on the internet, get a lot of traffic to wherever I am hosting these "statistics" and in turn, people would believe it! It's a joke. Does anybody ever read "The Enquirer"? The magazine is full of shit, and yet people still pay the money to read the worthless piece of crap. Why not support something valuable in life rather than some rich idiots making shit up to ruin other's lives?   But back to the point, MY point is that I don't hate ANYTHING personally. There are things I dislike, but hatred is too strong a word/feeling. To make a generalization about a country our size, and the size of America is never going to get anybody anywhere. There are people in Canada that I know that I dislike, and I am sure that an American citizen has someone that they dislike in America as well. But as soon as someone hears "Hey, That Canadian Hates You I Read It In A Magazine" (Figuratively speaking) then shit hits the fan. Take it easy, learn to cope, and understand that wherever you go not everyone will support/like you, but there will always be people who will support/like you. Take it into consideration.  Anyways, that is my 2 cents for todays post. No offense given, and none taken. I have no problem with Americans, there, I said it.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   I pray for this world to mend itself, but that will never happen... *sigh* Goodnight all.
