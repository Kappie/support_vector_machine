Let's see.  Today, I watched Back to the Future II and III.  I watched the first one last night.  Then, I played Top Spin (tennis game) on my Xbox.  I completed two of the tournaments, one in North America, and one in South America.  It is a pretty hard game, and you have to know what you're doing in order to succeed, but, once you get used to the controls, it gets pretty easy.  The more you score that the other player doesn't, the stronger you are, and you have the advantage.  Look for a review of the game on Monday's Digital Lust.  Tomorrow, I was supposed to go to Busch Gardens, but I have decided not to, mainly because I have so much more crap to do before school starts Monday morning.  So, I have decided to go next weekend.  I'd rather go to Universal, but, it's the other way, so I can't.  I will have my season pass for Universal by the end of October...I hope.  By then, I'll finally have my license, and I'll be able to go whenever I want.  So, haha.  G-Whatia?  Award shows have slumped to their all time low.  I was looking on TVGuide.com today to see if any good movies were on, and they showed an advertisement for "G-Phoria: The Award Show 4 (yes, 4) Gamers," on G4TechTV.  Obviously, the awards were given to the best games.  And, it was hosted by a porn star.  Sounds like a stupid idea, right.  Right you are if you said yes.  Who needs a videogame award show anyway?  Dumb people.  Dumb ideas.  Well, that's about all I got for tonight.  Hopefully, I'll have some idea worthy dream or something tonight that will help stimulate new posts for the blog, because right now, when it comes to posting on the blog, I'm braindead.  And that, of course, is bad.  See ya tomorrow, Bloggers.
