O__O) but at my new school, thats what everyone is (without the devilworshipping... stupid christian foos...), but everyone now calls me a poser for not headbanging everytime Smells Like Teen Spirit comes on the radio... I was never aware Nirvana headbanged at all... I was never aware heroin users could haedbang either...  Anyways, for the first day of school this year, I'm gonna be as Gangsta as I can be, even though I know I'd be a wanksta... yeah, its sad... Either that or I'm gonan become a conformist hating mall goth... w/e...
