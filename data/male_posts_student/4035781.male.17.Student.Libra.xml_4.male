For I have will, pride, perserverance and values. The will to live, the will to fight! I pride myself on this, and believe me I have will. She knows I have will.As the wall in my dojo says, "Fall down seven times,stand up eight". The destroyers of hope touch me no more. "Fallen angels arise from your graves, Free your spirits and unite" Hammerfall - On the Edge of Honour.  So once again I feel ready to face the world with my head held high. Diaster avoided, thank you for helping me find myself again.  D  Here we stand with the Future in our hands Through fire we'll rise to touch the sky
