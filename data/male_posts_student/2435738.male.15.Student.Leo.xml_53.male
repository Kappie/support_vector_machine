Full-time report:- SWEDEN       5-0       BULGARIA '32 Ljungberg '57,58 Larsson '78 Ibrahimovic pen '91 Allback ::WOOHOO!!MY FAVE TEAM!!! ::Sweden outclessed Bulgaria in the second half. ::THE LARSSON SHOW. ::Larsson was superb and showed his world-class striking when Edman put an inswinging cross right in front of Larsson and he put in a goal by a diving header.Beautiful. ::Wilhemsson charge into the Bulgarian penalty box and put in a middle-height cross from the right and Larsson scored with a fine volley. ::Then,in the 78th minute,Ljungberg ran past the Bulgarian defence and at just inside the penalty box,a Bulgarian defender slid in and Ljungberg fell,causing a penalty.Ibrahimovic ram it past the keeper although he dived to the right side. ::In the final few minutes,Larsson passed a through pass through the Bulgarian defence and made Allback free.Allback ran to just outside the box where the keeper ran out and he ram a high shot.Although the keeper managed to fingertipped it,the bal went in and sealed a miserable day for the Bulgarians.  Conclusion:Of course i am damn happy.My favourite team won!lol...ok...serious.The Swedish now top the group with an 'a lot better' goal advantage than the others.This made me confident that they can qualify for the quarter-finals.They showed what they can make the grade as they showed great teamwork and great individuality by some players.With Larsson in top form,Sweden have a good outside chance of winning the Euro.Take my words,man.Bulgaria is in deep trouble.They better find a way past the Danish because after the Danish would be the Italians who are the favourites in the group so i think Bulgaria can be counted as hopeless case.
