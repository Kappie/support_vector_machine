Consequently, most of my time has been spent there to attempt to help her adjust to living on her own...I know that she does not like it at all.  I am just hoping that it becomes like last year at SJC was, where she was able to get so busy she didn't have the down time to think about being alone.  Otherwise, she will probably end up being miserable for the next year living there, which will just make the year incredibly stressful for both us.  The good news is that we only have 10 months or so before the wedding and the beginning of our marriage and the end of living apart at great distances.  The experience of living apart has been incredibly difficult, especially after coming from SJC where you saw each other every day and for many hours.  I think it has helped us put things in perspective to better appreciate each other and to be more patient individuals, but despite the possible good things it has been a hard road, and I am looking forward to its end.  In other good news I found out about a week ago that I made law review.  I am very excited about it.  After I turned in my case comment I was pretty doubtful about it...anyway, making it will be a big boost to my law school career, and hopefully help my get a job in the location that I want.  I also bought my books earlier today, always amazes me how expensive they are, makes my book purchases at undergrad look small.  Oh well, I guess education is expensive.  I am looking forward to the beginning of the school year...near the end of summer classes I was completely burned out...but now having a couple weeks of being able to relax and read things of my own picking have helped me get energy again for another go around.  It will be a taxing year...classes being harder, law review, the job hunting process, and I still hope to get more involved with CLS...but I am looking forward to the challenge.   I finally saw Nick on Tuesday night and was able to ask him about being co-best man at my wedding.  My wedding party is now set...and I can't help but think about how blessed I am to have the friends that I do, and to be as close to them as I am.  One thing I have always loved about the group of friends that I am in is the diversity of interests and talents.  When at SJC, we were all involved in some stuff together, but we also were individually involved in other areas, and for the most part, were all studying different disciplines.  Now, post SJC, we all are doing different things, working different type of jobs, some related to our degree, some not, some taking grad classes part time, some full time...I just love being able to be in the large group and talk and realize how many different things that we are doing.  Anyway, can't think of anything else to write about for the moment...guess it's time to make something for dinner...
