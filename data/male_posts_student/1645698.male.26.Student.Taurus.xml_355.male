Anyhoo, without dwelling on the soon to be past, yahoo scrabble is very fun!  Except I don't understand why there are some really good people playing at the beginners level.  I know they want to earn more points and what not, but it's kind of like cheating!  It's just like easy pray, and I should know, because they've gotten to me too.  Those Bastards!    So as my farewell... I hope those yahoo scabble cheating bastards rot!  ROT I SAY!!!!!
