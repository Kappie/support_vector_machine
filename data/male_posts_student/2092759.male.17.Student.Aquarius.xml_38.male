Ive only had my licence a week so, under the vain assumption that I was invincible and infallable, I tried to cut a guy off on the curve on Santa Ana Canyon Road, coming out of the festival center. That worked out fine, except when I tried to turn onto Eucalyptus out of the curve I was going way too fast to make it. Instead, I hit the side of a Family of Fours SUV, lodging my left front headlight into their rear drivers side door. It is now official: I am the single biggest NOOB on the planet and will be locked away in my home for the majority of the summer, going to Work and the College only. I have to pay off the bill for the repairs to both his car and my own. Guess what that means kiddies? Means my ass is glued at work for the next three to four months, and a fair well to any form of social life over summer. Its my own fault I think in the end most of the punishment will be self-immposed. After about ten minutes of thinking about it right after the accident I came to a simple conclusion: You fucked up. You Fucked up, real, real bad. No more bullshit, no more blaming other people for your problems and your mistakes. Hone up and stop trying to save your own ass every second. And thats what im doing. So, for anyone who wants to know, heres whats going to be going on with me till Band Camp: Im going to be at home, online alot. I cant go anywhere. Actually, scratch that. I wont go anywhere. My cell phone is always on if anyone would like to talk. I leave for Washington DC on the 2nd of August sometime between 11 at night and 2 in the morning, I truthfully have no idea when.  If youd like to see me off, id be appreciated. Im going to be posting more, seeing as its all im going to be doing at night. Other than that, ill see you at Band Camp.
