Meh, Dickybod assures me it wouldn't have been that good anyway. Anyway, good news! I did that geography essay. Apparently it was Antigua. And the German! Badly. But hey, I'm not doing German next year, so no worries. I also did do a bit of revision. I read a few pages of the chemistry revision guide! *Cue Fanfare, marching band and several dancing elephants* Other than that, I haven't really been doing much today. Browsing the internet again as usual. Watched that 'Super Mario Reloaded' cartoon from Newgrounds - Damn well made. You can probably do a google search for it if you're that bothered, or just ask me. Oh, I know something else I can say: Yesterday a film called 'Guys and Dolls' was on, and being bored, I decided to watch it. All 2 and a half hours of it. Mainly because there were a few references to it in a Simpsons episode once. It wasn't very good. A boring love story set in that awful place known as the 'USA'. I also watched about 45 minutes of 'The Godfather' on Friday night. There wasn't any violence in the part I watched so I gave up and went to sleep. Supposedly it is good though... Oh, I just recomended this site to a friend of mine who is convinced light speed is possible. It has now convinced him otherwise: http://www.phys.vt.edu/~jhs/faq/sr.html. Or maybe he is just saying that to shut me up... Anyway, enjoy it, it's all I have to show you today.   Playing:  Again, nothing  Listening To:   Hell March  Watching:   The Architect scene from Matrix Reloaded in German. (I was bored!)  Annoyed With:   Revision  Confused About:   Alkanes and Alkenes  Mood:  Bored again.
