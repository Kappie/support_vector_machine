Anyway... finding myself annoyingly attracted to the 2 Hannahs on the bus. It's annoying because they both have the same name. What with Caroline too, then Rachel, Miller (kinda), Sally... heh, I'm back, folks.  Blood test results were good. I passed, I suppose you might term it. I don't have diabetes, TB, or a number of things. In fact, the results were what you might expect from a nicely healthy person. So it's just sinuses. W00t.  THE GIG YESTERDAY WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Or for those of you who can't read upper case for some reason; the gig yesterday was absolutely amazing. It was really fun. Tara did a weird dance afterwards, and was annoyingly attractive for a 12 year old. It was a little disturbing. What was more disturbing was Tom's dad being incredibly happy when she came out in a miniskirt, saying "Great, now we can see her legs!". Scary man. But yeah, roll on Sunday! Prestbury Scout hut, everyone, remember!  I'm about 100 pages into Grapes of Wrath now. It's quite good so far. Well, yeah, it is.  I'm really busy, and it's not helping.  Zoe, I'm missing you and I talked to you a couple of days ago. You have weird effects on me, lady of Charlton Kings. Look forward to talking to you soonish.
