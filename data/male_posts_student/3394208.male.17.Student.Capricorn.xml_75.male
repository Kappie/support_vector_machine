I’ve spent most of my life awake, and what I got were constant problems… wars, conflict, murder, basically we live in a world where people hurt people constantly… we try to blind ourselves from all these with drugs, friends and activities that keeps us from the ultimate truth, which is death, pain and suffering… we eventually hurt people consciously and unconsciously… but there isn’t anything we can do about it… it has dawned on me that without these conflicts, life would be a dull and empty void… we can’t escape the inevitable, we are going to continue hurting, we are going to continue blinding ourselves, and we are going do die eventually in the coming days… at this I would like to say we can’t sleep, live in our dreams and expect everything to go away when we wake up, these things will always be there when we do, so go ahead and sleep, live inside your head and brush these issues off your shoulders, but when you wake up you can only wait for the day to end, to escape this world, this reality, the truth again… I know I’ve gone through a lot and I still wake up cause I know that when after I’ve gone through these shit I’ll come out strong and soon after I won’t feel anything I’ll be numb from these conflicts and the only thing I’ll feel is pleasure soon after…
