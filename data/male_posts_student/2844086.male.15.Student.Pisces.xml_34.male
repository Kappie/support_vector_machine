When I went to the church today for my voice lessons, I also had to take a piano lesson because Ms. Rhonda has jury duty next week.  I kinda sorta learned how to sight sing today! Ok well I'm learning i should say. It was a fun voice class today. Instead of playing for the voice class today I was part of it. Then we used my private voice time to do my makeup lesson.  So ok here's my practice log for the day:  Scales  - all were really good today. Even A flat, but I did have a little trouble w/ D flat on the way down, but I think it's just beacuse I'm not used to doing 4 octaves.  Cadences  - All were really easy. 1st inversion for G Major is still a little ruff though. I know where the F# is in it now, but the fingering is killing me.  Technic  - "Snowmobiling" is still hands separate but I'm going to put them together tomorrow. I love INVERSIONS! Yeah as much as I love spiders! :)  Piano  - "Reveille" is still coming along. I actually almost have it down pat.  "Spinning Song"  - I love this song! It's gonna be hard to put hands together, but it's still fun. If you're learning inversions and their importance, then you should definately learn this song. Albert Ellmenreich composed it.  After I finished practicing I realized that I didn't practice Hanon. I assure you it wasn't on purpose. But don't worry we covered it in my lesson! :)  Have a great day! Go Practice!
