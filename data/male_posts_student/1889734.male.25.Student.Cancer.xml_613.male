It's like everything around me is all wrong, and I'm living someone else's life.  I shouldn't be doing this.  It isn't correct.  Yet I'm stuck with it.  I think I've learned, over the past six or seven years, that it isn't the job that is a problem - it's the choices I've made.  The idea of another 30 years of this looms over me, and it certainly isn't appealing.  Last week I had to go to an all day training where a man gave a presentation on the new Quality System we are rolling out here.  It's derived from Six Sigma, if that means anything to you.  Anyway, this guy was passionate about it.  He's been doing this for twenty years, and you could tell that he absolutely loved it.  I watched him for 8 hours, and thought about the fact that he had already done the same presentation three times that week, with another one to go after ours.  He travels to all the Pfizer sites to work on this.  And he just loved it.    I admire that kind of passion.  I wish I had it for this work, but I don't, and I can't pretend that I ever will.    Something isn't right with my world.    How about you?
