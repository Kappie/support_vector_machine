Drama finished at ten and I got home at eleven. Girls are trouble. Zel's gone, Dawn's gone and Jo's gone.  I'm tired of waiting for Jo. We've only just begun. It's just begun. I'm tired of politics.  It's clear that she doesn't value our friendship. To be frank, she's a liar because to my face she'll tell me that everything's ok. Everything is not ok. Sounds familiar huh. Damn, It's me isn’t it. I'm the commonality.  I saw Dawn today. I wished we'd talk, but I was too afraid. We've become estranged. 10/10 by the judges for screw up score.  Zel was, is and will probably continue to be my motivation. I think about her so much, it's painful. I get angry at myself for clinging to memories. This is not normal. Our anniversary's coming. We won’t do anything. I'll send her a message to which no reply will be made. I know this, but I still hope. What a fool I am. IT happened again yesterday at warm ups for drama. We had to remember the happiest memory we could. Zel was it. I picked the airport and re-lived everything. I felt the cold of the railings, listened to the soft background music, and heard her. What shocked my was the smell of her hair. I swear, it was her hair that I smelt. It was so weird, I looked around to find her, hoping that I would. I'm lying to myself.  Tomorrow is opening night for Moliere. I hope it goes well.
