I wasn't really tired, I don't know why, I got a little more sleep than normal so that was probably the reason. I went to APS and it was an okay day. We reviewed a little, took notes. And then we watched this really cool movie called FEED. It was a documentary about like presidental canididates when they were getting ready to just go on TV, but the cameras were already running just in case they got the server feed early or late. So it was pretty funny to see what they do when no one was watching. It was pretty cool. Then I was done with APS and I went home. I made myself some breakfast and just kinda hung out. Then my mom came home and she asked if we wanted Little Ceasers Pizza. Oh, you can not beat Little Ceasers. Five freaking bucks for a large pizza!! That is so awesome! And their pizza is very very good. You can get like 3 of them for the price of one at pizza hut. And Little Ceasers are so much better. Oh I was in heaven when she brought home that half cheese half pepporoni pizza and then cheasy crazy bread. Oh, I want some right now. I love that stuff so much! But then I ate. And then I watched the Newlyweds on MTV. Well, Jessica Simpson is hott. So, yeah I watched that for awhile. But she is kinda really stupid. They were talking about a double in baseball, and they had no clue what it was. They thought about it, and finally shot down the right answer and went with a new one. But it's perfectly okay because she is hot and really rich. But while I was watching that KLT called and asked if I wanted to go to Hollands with her, Natilie, Haley, and Kayla. So I went up there and me, KLT, and Natilie waited awhile for Kayla and Haley to come. They came and then we stayed there for awhile and then we walked back to KLT's house and me and Natilie both had to go. So we rode home. Once I got home, I ate dinner, but I forgot what we had. Oh well. But then Andrew asked if I wanted to go over to his house. So I went, and then Andrew drove us to Wild Bills. Andrew got his permit. Be afraid. lol actually no. He is an awesome driver. He did nothing wrong when I was there. And then we go this really good strawberry sundae at Wild Bills and then Andrew drove us home. Then we got online for a little and then asked Amanda and a lot of other people if they wanted to go play soccer again. So Brian came over, and then we walked to the field where we went Natilie and then Amanda and Amy came. And then we started to play, and then Chris Whitmer came and then we played more. Well, I suck at soccer, and most of the girls did to. So we got killed. But then we just ended up talking on the ground like we usally do. And then at 9:00, me and Natilie both had to go home, so we walked together, and then I went to Andrew's and got my bike. And then I saw Brian and Andrew and Chris walking together and then I talked to them for a little. And then rode home. I hadn't even started on my APS. I had a test today, and last night I didn't study till 10:30. Opps, and I only studied for about 15 minutes. Hopefully it pulls out. I'll find out on Monday I guess lol. And then my dog kept barking so I held her for a little to get her to stop. And then I finally got in bed. Then I woke up this morning, and went to school. I had my test that I just said I hardly studied for. I wrote four pages worth of stuff. I'm always really close to that time limit though. I'm scared that one day I won't make it. But my hand killed after we did that. After that, we got a 10 minute break and we went outside like normal, but then it was to cold so we came back inside and just talked. Then we went back to the room, and got assigned departments of the cabinant. We had to find information on it. Tara was my partner and we got the Treasury departmant. So he took us up to the computer lab, where hardly any of the computers worked. They all sucked, and were all broken. So me and Tara finally found one that kinda worked so we used it, and found our information really quickly and then had nothing else to do. So we just played games and just talked. My computer didn't have a mouse so I had to use the computer the whole time. It was horrible. But I did it! And then finally he let us out about 5 minutes early, and then I gave Ryn a ride home, and this is where I am now. Oh wait! This morning, when I was brushing my teeth. I broke a freaking bracet! I have never broken one in the whole year and a half I have had these braces. I have ate so many things I'm not suppose to, and it never broke. But when I freaking brush my teeth, all of a sudden I feel a pop, and then it comes out. It was really stupid, especially when I just had an ortho appointment two freaking days ago! I was not happy because now I have to go again. Oh well I guess. I have nothing to do today. So if you want to do something. That would be awesome because I'll be bored if noone wants to. Well food time! Hopefully I covered everything that was in my last post. If not, oh well I'm hungry! Later!
