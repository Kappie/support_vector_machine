Well, i have a reason for doing so. Many people in life faces different type of obstacles and difficulties. Some of them try all ways to avoid trouble while there are some who ran away from their problem thus causing much pain in them. Why am i saying all these? I am telling all these because i would like to share my own personnal experience with some of you, hoping that some of you do not make the same mistake as mine. I know that some of you might not agree with me cause each person has his or her own point of view of certains things. These people could give me some comment and maybe some solutions so that we can help others who are facing the same problem as what i am facing now.    I shall start with something short and sweet and going through in much details as some of you might read until fall asleep. I have an ex-girlfriend, recently broke off because of some unknown reasons. I do not know the real reasons up till now but my love for her have slowly faint away weeks by weeks. I know her since i was in secondary 4, while she was only in secondary 2 at that time. We know each other through another friend and we started chatting in MSN for quite sometime. Things progress further on that we sometime meet up to have chat. First starting to chat on the phone at night till day breaks, then i meet up with her near her house sometime to chat. Few months pass, a sudden abrupt change in her. She turn around and ignore me and even scolded me to " FUCK OFF". I was very shocked when she scolded me that. She was the only person in my life who scolded me the word. She was indeed first in almost everything. She was the first girl that i have ever go out to meet in a park, chat until so late in the middle of the night, first person whom i sacrifice so much and willing to do anything even to death. First person who ignore me also the first to leave me, leaving this friendship. Only till the end of the year, she suddenly talk to me and try to get back to me. At first i was not very interested to get back to her cause the tear in my heart was not fully heal. I slowly accepted her, news reach my ears that she like Bing Chen. Whom was my last Best friend but because of certain things, i fall out with him up till now i did not bother to talk to him so often though i swear to my grandfather grave yard to forgive and forget about the past.     Comes to near Feburary, i stead with her but this only last for a month before we broke off. It was just a week before my birthday that this happen. Up till now i do not know if that sms was on purpose or accidently sent to me. But i do know that my heart tells me, she send it to me on purpose. I didn't really want to ask her so much of the real reason. I did try but i know whatever the reason she gave was not from the bottom of her heart. After this incident, we didn't talk so much, even if we saw each other. It was like we are a world apart. I do not know how to express my feelings, deep down in my heart, the old wound torn open again and new wound appear. She had given me two wound in my heart. Really first person in my life to start all these. Everyday even though i feel very sad, i did not really show it to my classmate or whoever not even her. My tears did drop whenever i recall the past. I went to the beach almost every day and sit there for an hour to think. Recently i asked her about her marks, i was very shocked that she was the last person in the whole class. At first i did not believe until i asked again she told me the same thing again. I thought she might be joking with me thus i asked her for the last time and she scolded me " FUCK OFF" AGAIN. She had scolded me 2 times!   2 times you have scolded me this word. I am very dissappointed, downcast. I don't know how to descibe this feeling. My heart already bleed a lot and tear more than ever, adding on with this, it worsen. I logged off MSN messenger immediately. Just yesterday, i told her not to return the 30 bucks to me cause i find that there isn't a need anymore. I think the 30 bucks will be the last thing that i would lend my helping hand to her. I don't think it is worth it to further help her anymore. NOw she likes another guy i know. And since i am JUST A FRIEND, not her god brother i am not as important as anybody else in her life. I once told her that almost alot of people like to used me and now i really would like to tell her that she is indeed really using me and not really treat me as a friend. I know this is not important anymore cause it bascially waste my time to tell her off. *sigh* I don't know what to do. But my heart tells me not to bother about her anymore. Should i?
