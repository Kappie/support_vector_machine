Since yesterday was a fourteen-hour day spent doing our Sunday meeting and picking kids up from summer camp, we wisely didn't plan any big activities for day one. So I spent the day in rest and relaxation -- mostly naps punctuated by brief periods of eating. Just when I thought that the day couldn't get any better, I discovered that  urlLink Turner Classic Movies  was showing a marathon of sci-fi cult favorites like  urlLink Village of the Damned ,  urlLink Twenty Million Miles to Earth , and  urlLink Forbidden Planet . (The girls contented themselves upstairs with daytime TV.)  I'm enjoying myself. It feels so good to slow down after pushing myself for so long -- and I still have six days left!
