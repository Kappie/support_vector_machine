I mean, who calls just to yell at them and not hear them out? Jackass -.-  * Realized something was wrong -- We bought the wrong desk after building half of it. >_  In conclusion, not a bad day for the most part but it could have been better. I mean, !jeez! that phone call alone can ruin anyone's day especially when I wasn't as wrong as he said I was. Grrr. Yes, that was a period, not an exclamation point(!).      -- Fea'
