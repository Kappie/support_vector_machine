The investigative team hasn't been able to identify the body, and yet they remained on the crime scene trying to sort things out.Robert laghed at thesite ofall of them acting like ants, hurrying along before a storm comes and ruins it all. He walked to his car and sat in the driver's seat.   "What's your assessment Freeman?" Roberts superior Captain Anthony White asked while he peered down at him.   "Hell if I know," Robert replied as White laughed. Robert didn't know or really care that much. The victim was Caucasian and in his early thirties. His cause of death was still unknown. The man looked fine. Nothing seemed wrong with him, he was just dead. Like he just deiced to stop living. The body was at the morgue for a full autopsy, and they hadn't yet received word on the man's Identity or cause of death. They were just scavenging for any more evidence they could find.  Robert sat back in his car shuffling through pictures of the man before he was taken to be examined.   "Hey, Freeman! Go to the morgue and pick up the report on this guy." White ordered as Robert closed his car door and drove off.   He was on his way to the morgue, driving down the highway. He began to contemplate, he thought of his mother and glanced at his left arm. Scars lined his wrist. He made those scares. He made them at the lowest point in his life. 'Why had I been so stupid?' he questioned himself silently. He vowed his life would never sink so low again.  He pulled up into the parking lot of the Government building. A man in a white lab coat came outside, he looked surprised to see him there. The man spoke into a radio while staring at the approaching car. Robert pulled up next to the man and got out.   "I uh, wasn't expecting an you to be here," he said as Robert got out of his car.  "Why not? we're all waiting on that report," he told but the man still didn't understand.   "Report?" the man asked as Robert read his nametag. Greg Staton.   "Listen, just take me to the autopsy room," he instructed Greg. He then turned around and walked through the doors and down the hall. "So uh, Greg," Robert said to get his attention, but the man did not reply. "hey, Greg," he said this time taping on his shoulder.   "Oh, yes-me . . .sorry," he replied, as they walked into the autopsy room. X-ray pictures covered an entire wall.   "Sir?" The doctor said as Robert turned to face him, the doctor was extremely nervous as if his very life hung in the balance and one little tip of the scale would kill him, "I did a complete examination and found that his death was caused crushing of his brain."   "What could this mean doctor? How is this possible?"- his cell phone rang.   "This is Freeman."   "yo, Bobby this is Carter."   "What do you want?"   "We identified the body, he is John Tyres. So we did a background check on the guy. He is a former associate of Lavits Sokal and Geoff Moore."  Sokal . . . where had he heard that name before, "Did you look them up?"   "By now I thought you would know not to ask stupid questions like that, of course I did. Sokal was a preacher, but disappeared seven years ago. And Moore was a multi-billionaire, but he passed away five years ago leaving his vast fortune and successful business to his son Michael. Then Michael died in a mysterious accident a year later and it was all given to Moore's adopted son Saul Kovin." Carter slowly informed.   "So where is this kid?" Robert requested pondering the idea of a teenager owning a successful business.   "He lives in his late father's mansion, which is on the outskirts of New York."
