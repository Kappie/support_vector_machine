Damn, I'm addicted to knives! Gonna get that nice little silver hoooked-ish knife when I get enough moolah. :D  Talking to Moca and Martin on MSN. Martin having his Sonia problems so I'm just trying to help him out 'cos Sonia IS my daughter. :) I'm gonna try pulling something... hope it works.   Oh my gosh... something really frightening just happened. The "freakishly ugly grade 7 bisexual girl" just talked to me. She said that my display picture (in black and white) was "damn sexy" and I'm just like :| and then she said "HEHE I LUV U I GOTTA GO EAT DINNER. I MISS U LOTZ". So freakin scary! Ew!  Now I'm talking to Tiff, Moca, and Martin. Still worried about high school, that guy. Well I kinda am too... I've got my reasons. Bleh... *sighzZ* Freakin hard.  He said he'd call me back at 6:30 but whatever. Probably eating dinner or he's still in the shower. Blaahhh. I'm going downstairs for ice-cream. Be back later. :)  Moca, don't fuck him!
