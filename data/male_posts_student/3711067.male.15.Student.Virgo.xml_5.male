There’s a place within all of us, It’s inside, When we’re alone, We can calmly hide, No worries can get us, Where no one has spied. Don’t quicken step, Slow down your stride, Rebuild your pride. Happiness builds and a smile is about to begin, Forget your worries, Forget your sin, Calm your body, Calm your whole, Calm yourself, Calm your soul.
