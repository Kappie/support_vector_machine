I took a drive down to Stockton at the county clerks office to get my birth certificate to take my learner's permit test. That felt like a waste of time to me. Oh well, can't undo whats already been done, although sometimes I wish I could.   All boredom and more boredom makes Colin talk in the third person. Colin is extremly bored guys. He is so bored he has no idea what to do. I just hope Colin finds something to do soon or he might as well just snap, or fall asleep, whichever is more likely to come first.   Well, that is it for now, I may or may not have more writing depending on my mood and the ratio of my "Butt in chair in front of my monitor" to my "Butt not in chair in front of my monitor". Have a great day.
