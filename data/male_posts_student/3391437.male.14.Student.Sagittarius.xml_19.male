Internet, a computer “network consisting of a worldwide network of computer networks that use the TCP/IP network protocols to facilitate data transmission and exchange information.” Internet is a great source of good and bad information that can be viewed by those who have a computer and have access to the Internet.      In my opinion I should not be blocked from accessing the Internet because the Internet is the gateway to great knowledge. Some say Internet is bad and should be banned for teenagers. This statement is entirely incorrect. A teenager can explore the outer world by using the Internet. “One can learn more than he ever could by using the Internet.”   Internet is a source of information. Not allowing me to access the Internet is no different than not sending me to school. Internet can teach almost anyone a great deal. Hence, I should be allowed to access the Internet.
