Maths  This latest update is comin to ya from the Maths department. I handed in my Maths C assignment. God knows how I did... I did get an answer for The Dreaded Monkey Problem. I'll go through that another time.   But, from one assignment to another. I just started on my Maths B assignment, and in a few words, it's a Piece of Shit. Biorhythms and sine waves and all that crap. Stuff I'll never use again. But, as always, it'll be written up and posted on the interest. Speaking of writing up, I'll do my monkey problem up and how I got my answer 'n' all that the other day. Bet y'all can't wait.    BRISBANE  Only two more sleeps until I go to Brisvegas. Wo0t. I'm so nervous about seeing Kieran though. What if he hates me?!    Aren't these headings getting annoying?!  So, thats enough of those. I'm gettin sick of them too :p  I'm bored. I can call Kieran in 35 minutes. But do I want to? Of course... I guess...?  OOH OOH OOH.   What's the goss, Adam?  (sorry, couldn't help myself)  Anywho, there is friction between Ellen and Corinne, because Corinne is going with Richmond to do her English assignment and Ellen has been left in the lurch with noone to do it with. Ellen has been bitching about Cori all day. So meh.  Also, this is what I heard about Emma and Tanya's little happening. Tanya is pissed at Emma because Tanya and Tim aren't talking, but Emma still likes Tim. Or something. Let's just say it's silly bitchy girly fighting.   Adam's Alter Ego-slash-Person with the same name  (last one, I promise)  I have a twin! Adam Roe, an ex-Professional Skateboarder started  urlLink Lunchbox Studios  in 1990. Wow. A professional skateboarder. I wish it was me.   Yibbedee Yibbeda, that's all folks  (baha, I had my fingers crossed)  That's all for today :P
