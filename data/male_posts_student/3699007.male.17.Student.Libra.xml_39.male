Ran into Blair...it was nice to see her since it's been a while. Then, I went over to Britt's and we hung out for a while, then he called Briana and asked her to go with us to On the Bricks and she ended up not being able to go, so me and him went and met Laura and Tim there.  Virginia Coalition was pretty good, North Mississippi Allstars are awesome live...their lead singer/guitarist is great.  Collective Soul surprised me in that they are much harder sounding in concert.  Their frontman is a badass.  The concert was packed.  Next time (Friday- Blues Traveler, Rehab, Cypress Hill) we're going to do 2 things that we didn't this time.  Drive instead of taking MARTA and bring lawn chairs.  Other than the MARTA ride from hell on the way home (there were like 150 people in the car we were on) and having to sit on the ground, it was a great time.  Ok, so saturday, I went to the mall with my mom and my aunt and got a pair of pants and a shirt.  Then, I came home and washed the Expedition.  Today, I washed my dad's car and then went to the hospital to see my grandmother since I hadn't seen her for 8 days.  Today was the best she's been since the surgery.  It was great to see her talk a lot.  They're finally starting to take her off a lot of the medicine she's been on, so she's getting a little more "normal" every day.  Oh well, that's my weekend.  If all goes well, I'll be hanging out with a hot chick some this week. Hahahaha :-)
