Check out the metaphor usage:  (T)he Republican-led Congress is wallowing toward a garishly spectacular finale: a $284 billion omnibus spending bill, a haphazardly stitched hulk that gives a bad name to the usual legislative metaphors about sausage-making and bauble-laden Christmas trees. This bill, being rigged as a take-it-or-leave-it voting prod for lawmakers antsy to get home, begins by combining five expensive measures that deserve separate votes because they are vital for financing much of the government next year. But the real political goal is to festoon this appropriations wad with an incongruous mix of resurrected controversies, hometown pork and hot-button proposals.  It is no comfort that there is still a week's bargaining left before the Capitol auction gavel descends. In a resurrection worthy of Transylvania, a nefarious $7.2 billion sweetener for doomed tobacco growers has flapped back to life, its chances uncertain. The real pity, large as the omnibus bill itself, is that the full contents and damages will not be known for weeks, even by the lawmakers who vote for approval. If the old Congressional problem was gridlock, the new one is juggernaut.
