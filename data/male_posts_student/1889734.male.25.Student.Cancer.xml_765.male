Over vacation, I was in several stores, loitering around and trying to soak up the atmosphere.  However, instead of the warm feeling of peace I normally associate in such a setting, I began to experience an itching agitation, driving me from the store as one would flee a creaky 'haunted' house in the middle of the night.    In standing in front of the Science Fiction shelves, I am struck by the feeling that I am standing in front of a shadowy portal, and on the other side, the real me is gazing back, ruminating on a life stuck in an 8-5 job as one of many possible pasts, thankfully avoided through the realization of my dream of being a successful writer.  I feel like the apparition, and the idea on the other side of this vision is more real than me.  I am seized with an intolerable urge to flee, to turn away from the obviousness of my unhappiness.  The strength of this feeling is beyond anything I've ever experienced, and I think it stems from the fact I've essentially given up on my novel, at least over the past few months.  I think about it daily, and I still feel good about the potential, but I'm having trouble getting back to it.    So these feelings are part of myself, angry over this abandonment of what I see as my vocational destiny and purpose.    Gotta get off my rear and get on with what I want to do.  Same old story, and I'm sure most of you are sick of hearing me whine about it.    On with it already....
