We left Friday morning around 7 and stopped over in Schoolcraft to get some chow at MarJo's west, let me tell you, wow, they have REALLY good food! Then with a full stomach and back in the motorhome I was off to sleep while listening to Simple Plan set on repeat. I managed to get in about 2 hours of sleep since I had only slept 2 hours Thursday night it felt really good to get some more sleep. So anyway we arrived at the campground around 1pm or so, I helped Marie and my dad set up the camp and then waited for Addie so we could chill. I hadn't seen her in ages so it was great to see her again, she's still the same old Addie, all jiggalette(sp?) and stuff. She brought her friend Kelsie from the lakes so we all chilled and got everything set up like the tents and such. Then I told them I was gay and they were all like wicked awesome! So that went over well with them, I knew that it would be fine with them since they both know what it's like to be discriminated or hated on... So then we went for a swim that lasted about an hour or two even though the water was freezing we still had to go see our old pals, the buyos (sp?) just kidding but yeah we always have a tradition of hanging out by them and trying to stand on them and such. So after we get out we made our way to the swings. I love swinging, it's like soothing to me, I've always loved it. So anyway our cousin Tyler showed up with his friend from last year, Kevin (he's CUTE!), and we started chillin. Then they left and this guy comes up with one of my girl cousins, he was really cute and I told Addie and Kelsie that he was hot. I figured he was my cousin's boyfriend but then I heard him talk and I was like YEAH HES GAY! He was also listening to Maroon 5 on a little radio thing so I walked up to him and said good music and started talking to him, his name was CJ. I told him I was gay and he's like cool I am too! Then my dad was yelling for me so me and the gang (Addie and Kelsie) ran back to camp to see what was up, pizza was there. That's right we ordered pizza, none of us wanted to cook after a long ass ride, we just wanted some good food that we didn't have to cook or anything like that. It was some greasy ass pizza so I ended up eating have a slice and then felt sick from all the grease so I gave up on the pizza thing and just grabbed a pop and took of with the gang yet again. We just went to the beach and by the time we got there my cousin Tyler's friend Kyle was there and we all went for a walk while Addie snuck a cig, then it started to rain so we ended back in the tent chillin to some music. When it stopped it was dark so we all sat by the lake on a picnic table until about 3am then went back to camp to listen to music and eventually fall asleep. The next day I woke up around 6 since I wasn't going to sleep anymore with people up and moving already so I got up stoked the fire up and then grabbed the shower bag and walked up to the showers to wash the previous day's grime. By the time I was done with all that everyone else in the camp was up and moving, my dad started to cook breakfast when I seen CJ he came over and we talked about music but then my cousin took him away so they could eat. So after breakfast Addie and Kelsie were still sleeping so I helped Marie put up this shitty canopy thing that kept falling over but we got it up and we were proud of it! When the wind came about it came close to collapsing! So then I chilled around camp and the beach for a while until Addie got up at about 12. After she got up we had some Goober sandwiches and then a Josh special (roast beef and salami) over the fire. By the time we got around to doing anything it was dinner time already so we went and ate at the big buffet style Rohdy dinner, it was good I had a piece of chicken and some taco salad along with dirt cake. I was pretty much stuffed. So then we found Tyler, Kyle, and Kevin and got them all in the lake to swim. Then CJ joined us and he kept like getting close to me it was great! So then we got out and we went our ways until after the auction was over... So then we all went to Addies campfire and chilled there for a few hours... Then I got to talking to McKenzie (sister) and she said I'm going to hook you up with some alcohol if mom says yes so I asked her she said yeah because she would rather me do it there where she knows I'm safe. So she fixed me a drink that was half of a pepsi in a can with the other half vodka, so I took it back and bragged it up, chugged it down didn't feel anything, then I had her make another one and took a few hard lemonades and drank all them real fast. I ended up being smashed! So we were all just like chillin in the grass so I lied down and CJ lied down right next to me and started playing with my hair and we were all like cuddling and stuff he told me you know I could take advantage of you right now but I'm not like that. So yeah it was really really sweet! Even though I couldn't enjoy it as much since I was hammered it still wowed me. We all chilled there till like 4am then went to camp and I ended up staying up for another 2 hours and then hit the bed for about 2 hours. When we got up we had a Rohdy breakfast and me and my sister booked out of there goign about 90 lol it was fun! Well, there's alot more to talk about so I'll do it later I can't feel my fingers anymore!
