Rotary leadership convention ended; I made many friends and watched as they all left for their respective places in existence. College fair passed, reminding me of the inevitable crawl of minutes toward the end of this life and the beginning of another. Friends fade in and out of my peripheral vision, my hormones explode and fade and explode again, and I am currently choking on my own escophagus.  I was at the Leadership conference in Olive Branch over the weekend, enjoying myself thoroughly. I actually danced, which made me swell with exorbitant pride. And I met this wonderful strawberry blonde at the conference who I slow danced with and seriously considered dating. However, cue the problems: she lived an hour away, and even though she said she would have dated and considered me perfect boyfriend material, she was conservative, and it would not have worked out. Next morning, everyone leaves, and I am seated in a Rotary van headed back to Memphics, thinking of everyone who I probably wouldn't see again, despite efforts to do otherwise (for example, Jessica, the strawberry blonde).  I am now realizing I get jealous too fucking easily. I hate myself for it. Even worse, I sometimes hate other people for it.  At the college fair, my mother took the approach of, simply put, "Go to this College Fair today or you  will  end up at University of Memphis or UT Knoxville," which pissed me off highly and set me into a thoroughly upset mood. This was about five minutes after I returned from the Convention, by the way.  My dreams are convoluted, and many of the ideas that seep into these surrealistic dreams are either actions I never want to take or actions that I would love to take but will never happen. So my brain is teasing me again. And I am fatigued often. My parents have an inclination to believe such may have been in part from the 20 mm of meds. I cut it down to 15 mm. Now I am getting depressed.  I really need to get work. I also really need to get some type of close relationship. It would probably help to the extreme, both of these. I am currently trying.  I have no idea why I am stating all this online. God damnit.
