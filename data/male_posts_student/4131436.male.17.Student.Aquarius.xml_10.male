No matter.. Still... Helped my Dad clean up the kitchen including his 6 fish tanks! Haha!! And the fishes are like piranha!! Kinda freaked out when the biggest fish flown off the net..! Wriggling on the floor.. Gasping for air..Haha! Anyway... My Mum also helped out around.. Around 4pm, my cousin and me took off to meet my sister to go to Queensway.. She wanna go shopping.. So I tag along.. She bought some shoes.. Me? Nah.. I'm broke.. Even if I had the cash.. I'm saving it to buy a new phone.. Darn! Saw Jonathan with his pals.. Smokin' as usual... He never saw me though...  Nothing much happenings today.. Went home around 7pm.. and chilling out with my family and fooling around with my nephew.. Went online and Jenni was away.. *SiGhZz* Well...
