It's a virtual world where you take care of a virtual pet, and wander around and play games to earn points you can use to buy virtual stuff.  It's a little scary too, though, there are all these ads and games aimed at kids, like "visit McDonald's land and earn 100 neopoints!" and you can earn points by watching commercials for kid's cereal.  But they have some cool games, everything from craps and poker to word games and such.
