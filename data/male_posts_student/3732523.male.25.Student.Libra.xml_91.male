Even many years and a Ph.D. later, across the Atlantic, and to a different culture, I still find myself in that ever-terrifying first week at school.  Back at the age of 6 or 7 it was worries about if I would have to sit next to the class bully, could I get the paper book jackets on my text book straight, and would I spend all of my lunch money on football pencils.  Now, its more worries if I will understand the teacher in German or Italian, will I have to sit next to that obnoxious woman from the Czech republic, and who will I be paired with to complete the next assignment.  Thus today, I started 2 classes..well both were followups to previous classes - Tennis and German.  Tennis of course is really just a fun class - I should practice for homework, but usually do not.  I did notice 2 new women - but the darn instructor seperated all the men from the women..so I gotta figure out how to sneak onto the women's court next time ;)  Then it was off to my German class.  This one is an advanced class that is really like going to a high school English class -but in German - complete with reading novels and having to write essays discussing characters and their motives.  Only one other man in my German class - a Chinese- otherwise its dominated by Eastern European Women who delight in correcting me.  I forgot to bring my book with me, thus I had to share a book with one of them today.   Tomorrow the classes continue again with Italian..Oh boy..I hope I remember how to understand that language ;)
