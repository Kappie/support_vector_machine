Last night was just pretty awesome. The See You at the Pole Rally was last night at Union Grove High School and a band called Casting Crowns was there. They were pretty good. I love that one song called 'If We are the Body.' I went with church so everyone that I respect was there with the exception of a few not being there it was a great time. I witnessed a large number of fellow youth get saved which was incredible. Shaun, I can't even begin to try and start to say... What you did last night was simply incredible and exactly what I needed. It only caused me to cry a little until I got back on the bus and started thinking and talking to Michelle. lol God is great. What more can I say man? 
Did I mention I wish I was at school? Well I did again. I hope certain people keep there cool today without me being there to calm them down. So much is going on it's weird. All of it is good in its own way however weird that sounds. As I've learned recently, God knows what is going to happen in our lives before it happens so when it does happen you just have to know that it happened for a reason. In the end everything happens for a reason. There is a reason why I am growing closer to certain people. There is a reason why I'm being pulled away from other people that I use to be dragged down by. There is a reason why I can say I have a best friend or two or three or four now and know that they feel the same exact way. There is a reason as to why some people are going to read this and take it the wrong way and try to blame me for things with out even thinking about it first. That's just life I suppose and I now know that I have something to live for so I am ready to face what ever life has to throw at me because I'm on God's path and on His path everything happens for a reason.
