Today Brandon and I went to visit Andy in his new place down in SD. It's a cool place. We hung out and drank... went down to downtown and drank more at Rock Bottom. Good stuff. Good times hanging with the posse. Didn't get a chance to meet up with Flo and Julia though.... seems we're always in the same vicinity, but don't get a chance to meet up. Oh well... hopefully I'll see all of the girls tomorrow.  In rotation now...  Bad Religion 's  All Ages .  ***
