After psoting last, i went inside and watched tv, and ate something, then i lied down...and fell asleep...i took a nap...wtf.... i cant remember the last time i actualyl sat down and said.  "I need to take a nap"  Once my mom came home, she figured out how to use my dads digital comera, took pictures of us(my mom and i) and we left them on the camera, so he has some pre...pictures on it.  Tommmorow im going to my aunts for erm... i dunno, one of those family gatherings. Hopefully its not boring, and maybe i will go see dodgeball tommorow. Wel l for now im going to stay online, talk to some of my friends, then go to sleep.  Until next time.
