It was all action, it had Kelly Hu basically naked throughout the whole movie, and the Rock battling fire ants. I can't really say much more about it. It was quick and to the point.  I'm off to bed early tonight... or at least I'm going to try to be. On my to do list for tomorrow is... art, looking through the Hays papers for stuff on  Blockade , lunch, yoga, call CSUF about my transcripts, and try to get a viewing of  Blockade  at UCLA's Film and Television archive... not necessarily in that order.  ***
