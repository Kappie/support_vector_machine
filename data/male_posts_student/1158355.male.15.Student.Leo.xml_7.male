Tee hee. I watched Amanda own Paul in NBA Street. We also watched MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING... it was... strange. Greeks use Windex on everything. Ok, so after Amanda's we went to my cousin's house who lives right near her and it's funny my cousins go to Sachem. We watched my cousin play Final Fantasy and he fought a huge hairy guy. It was the good guy's dad. During the movie the little Japanese guy with blond hair goes... "Dad". Dad - "Ya?" Chinese Guy - "I hate you." I don't know it sounded funny coming out of the Japanese guy's mouth. Seriously, go watch DragonBall Z, those Japanese cartoons are hilarious. Today I played in the snow with Jimmy and Pat. We tunnels in the snow and when a car would come by we'd dive backwards into the snow like scuba people. The best part was when Pat and I were like IMAGINE IF YOU WERE IN THE TUNNEL AND OUT OF NO WHERE CAME A FOOT! So... Jimmy made a ridiculously big tunnel and Pat was in the tunnel and sure enough my foot went right into the tunnel. HOW WEIRD. Ok, these things aren't funny to you but if you were there, man you'd die from laughter. Well... no band practice yet! How sad, I wonder what's going on tomorrow?
