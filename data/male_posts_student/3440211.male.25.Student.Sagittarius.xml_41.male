The decission carries on and yes tomorrow is the day in which we start to make things different. I do not know if for better or for worse but hopefully all for the better.  Its a bright summer day and I pitty those that have to study. At least my girlfriend has finished her exams. It is so nice to have her back.  Well the mood is down... but the quiet is there before the storm...  Lets kick some arse... and some proper arse.
