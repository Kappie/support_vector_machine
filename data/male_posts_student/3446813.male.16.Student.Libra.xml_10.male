Anyways *cough* after bombing that lab practical *cough* im more than sure thats how its gonna turn out...  now that i think about it, i guess now that i dont have band i dont have any extra-cirricular activities...aww boo hoo coo koo kachoo for me. yea...that'll surely look good on my college applications, with that big  slacker  stamp across my transcripts, how depressing.  on a lighter and darker note i heard ppl had a lotta fun at prom. though i have heard first hand the anal craptacularness of our school administration. one of my friends from comp tech class told me that he arrived 8 minutes late his whole party mr melendez and mrs yarboi wouldn't let them in  ON PROM!  It was his senior prom too! thought hings basically turned out all-right sort of when it was found out they had a kickass chauffer. first he argued with mr melendez about how he's ruining the kids lives and scarring them for life and junk up to a point where mr yarboi caome out. then both our wonderful administrative school leaders started threatening to sue if he didnt scram, so they left. the driver was nice enough to give each guy $20 and drop them off at down town Disney! after they got bored there, the driver used his contacts to get them a private party at a marina club or whatnot where they got free drinks and all. but all in all i guess it still sucks they werent allowed to make it into their own senior prom. oh well, what can ya do?  yup well got studying to do, cya
