I think I am going to build an easel tomorrow for my drawing abilities.  Then the best part of my day came. I got to talk to you, and tell you most of what you just read. but above all i got to hear you once more. you are so wonderful, i just cant say that enough. im almost to the point of counting the hours until you are back, but not quite yet ;) oh god i just, i love you so damned much. just, thank you. *hugnsmooch*  then tonite we went mini golfing, me tessa curry heidi chris and carlos. it was fun, but chris seemed to be being a bitch to heidi, so that wasnt cool, but ill check into that later, maybe just uber joking.  remind me to tell u something slightly funny. it involves how a first for you was also a first for me, basically.  and now, time for bed, i am dead tired, and i miss you, so sleeping will fix both.  gnite  *mwah*
