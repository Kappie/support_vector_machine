I hate to sound like an emotionless jerk, but I can't say that I am really sad. I am sad that my mom is sad, but I didn't know him, I've only met him like twice in my life. *sighs* Well, not much else is new, kar is getting pretty boring. Erm, what to do. I'll make a nice picture out of / \ things. /                  /_|\_Does that look like a star? No, well, use your imagination, make it whatever you want. *sniffles* EDIT - it moves them to the left, so, it obviously doesn't look like a star anymore. *cries*
