I’m is set an hour slow, And you’re an hour fast Cause I’m being Stupid and reckless, Broken and thoughtless, Brazen and cocky It’s the same old story: You never know what you’ve got until it’s gone!  Just remember Those good times we had Just remember The funny things we said But don’t remember The times that were sad Just remember It’s all in the past  Time’s not gonna wait, And my sand’s sinkin fast. That me that you did know, It’s gone past,  It’s gone right out the window! Don’t make it hasty Take your time and don’t judge so fast.  Just remember Those good times we had Just remember The funny things we said But don’t remember The times that were sad Just remember It’s all in the past  Don’t live by the hour-glass Don’t let our sand run fast Allow me to come through, let our hours be sweet The world keep’s turning Each day a new So don’t keep on burning In some day that’s through.  Just remember Those good times we had Just remember The funny things we said But don’t remember The times that were sad Just remember It’s all in the past     here ends the love making session
