Also got a scanner, too. Now more pictures (maybe on request) will come in. If I don't get raped with requests, I'll draw something that you want me to, provided my talent allows it.     Had some fun at the shores of Misquamicut (I'm not sure how it's spelled) despite the lack of chicks. Friend of mine, Tim, had a little noisemaking gadget that said things like "Fuck you!" and "You're an asshole!". So of course we played around with that the whole time.     No chicks at the beach means no OTHER chicks at the beach. 2 hotties went with us, and although they were way outta at least my league (not that I'd go for it anyway) they still had us laughing and stuff during the times that toy wasn't spouting off obscenities.    That's it for now, see ya later people.
