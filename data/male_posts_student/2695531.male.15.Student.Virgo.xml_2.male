Our government should be ashamed of its intelligence failures, yet at the same time, we need to be optimistic for the future and prepare for the worst. Chairman Thomas Kean of the panel stated that the "United States government was simply not active enough in combating the terrorist threat before 9/11" and that U.S. officials had a "failure of imagination" in understanding the threat posed by al Qaeda before the attacks. The independent commission did not specifically blame either the Bush or Clinton administrations but rather our government's general intelligence capabilities as a whole.
