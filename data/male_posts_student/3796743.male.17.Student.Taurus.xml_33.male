I guess, I was thinking about some old crap that came up a long time ago. I realize that I have friends that claim to be my friends, but if I knew the truth about them they would never be my friend. I would not let them. It's confusing. I wish people would be honest with me. If you have something to say...tell me, e-mail me or something. Some people disguise themselves as my friends, but in all honesty they're cowards. Plain and simple.  The plan is still in action, looking good.  Dum de dum....I'm bored. Today was good. Just a day...I guess. I realized something... I dot dot dot a lot. Like this... ! I do that a lot. I should stop. Today I went to Les Miserables with Emmy. I hope I spelled that right. It was a really good show. Like REALLY good. So that's good. Then we (we being Alex, Emmy, and I) drove to Lacey. Why would we drive to Lacey you might ask? I continue to ask myself. There was no point. But we went to one of those Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combinations. We got pizza and enchaladas (sp?), and some like fried apple things. It was yummie. Then I dropped Emmy and Alex off and sped home to be home by my ghetto curfew of midnight. Damn Allison, she's the reason I have to be home at midnight. errgh...Tomorrow I have to wake up early and do crap with my mom to get ready for our little family vacay on Monday. I'm, continuing, for some strange reason, to look forward to it. Then I'm going to a party at Morgan's with the gang. It'll be fun. So yah..it's late...I'm drowsy.  I gotta stop thinking about everything, go back to the good old days when I was ignorant, blonde, and living a life in absolute bliss. Good night.
