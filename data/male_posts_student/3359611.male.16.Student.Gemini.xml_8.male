Yesterday, the window cleaner came over. It was a bit annoying to have so many people in the house, with three window cleaners traipsing through the house, so I went out into the garden for a smoke.  

While I was out there, the head window cleaner came over and asked for a light. We sat on the bench of the garden for a bit, and chatted.  

The guys fucking wicked. He comes over once every eight weeks or so, and has done for years, but I've never spoken to him properly before, just noticed he was a cheerful fellow. Now I've actually talked to him, I've come to the conclusion that he is in fact the embodiment of happiness.   

We were talking about window cleaning, and how fucking hard it must be to do some of the complex windows in our house, like the roof of the conservatory, and the windows above it. From here, we got chatting about his life. The guy actually has no worries at all. He's got a job he enjoys. He doesn't earn very much for it, but enough to haev his own house, nad hes got a family. He works when he wants to, he goes out when he wants. Hes the kind of person who just reminds you of sunny days, for some reason. I reckon it would be impossible to be even mildly depressed around him. Its weird. Hes got this kind of happiness that doesn't grate, or get on your nerves, or piss you off at all. He just kinda.... radiates. Unworried by anything.  

Nice bloke  

Thats about it, really
