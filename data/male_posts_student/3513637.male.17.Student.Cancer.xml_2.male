(john)  Well after all that i just have to point out a small incident that involved Ben a corroded post and a lit teacher on the wrong side of old. Ok maybe not the corroded pole that was just for effect >.> ...  Well last year or so i was led to believe (note: don't believe everything anyone tells you, or is that don't believe anything everyone tells you?), anyways back to moment. Ben, the man, the moment, the hour, the ... well anyway Ben clearly stated that he liked his lit teacher, Mrs Strawn. There is clear evidence from certain people that state that "he was checking her out".  The concept of a guy "checking out" a girl would make sense and would be quite a natural thing, if it isn't then err... somethings wrong. This particular case though, it is errr... well lets put it this way. Ben is arrogant and he's wait i dont even know 16? 15? hes a teen lets just say. Now on the other hand, Mrs. Strawn... the age category that she would fall into would be better suited as bens... grandma?  However you put it, it is quite wrong. True you shouldn't judge someone by their looks, but um... when someones old enough to be your grandma the idea of "checking her out" would place ... Ben, in an awkwardly WRONG situation. Ben if you are reading this, it would be a good time to considering counseling of some sort.
