Until I just talked to Steve, who bitched at me and called me a "fucking bitch" for not caring that I "ditched" Kyle and Conor.  I didn't do a FUCKING thing....Ervin is the one who even mentioned that we were going to Rusty's...if ERVIN woulda just shut his mouth and not said anything, then there would have been no "ditching."  It would have just been peachy.  FUCK YOU!!  Brittany's was really lonely.....probably the highlight of the night was playin' ditch with a bunch of people....ME BEING THE FIRST PERSON TO SCORE!!!  w00t!!!!  Go Spenser, Go Spenser, It Cho Birfday, It Cho Birfday....WOOO!!!!  IT was fun though....lonely but fun.  Sum of the loneliness went away when Brittany and Tascha walked over to me and said that no matter what "sum people" think, they like me.  I'm kool to talk to apparently or sumthin'....it was nice.   I actually got to talk to Tascha and Brittany a little each yesterday, and that was pretty kool.  Tina got pissed at me because I was flickin' pennies and a few of them happened to hit her...sorry.  La-Ti-FRICKIN'-Da. I flick pennies...it's just what I do...not like I mean to hit anyone really.  Ervin THINKS that maybe I have awesome accuracy, but I don't, I just kinda point and shoot in a general direction, and if hits sumone, sw33t.  GAH!!  Sum people just can't take a little fun.  I want to jump on my trampoline.  The loneliest part was probably when I sat on the trampoline by myself for over an hour, and no one came and said "Hi" or anything.  I didn't get all pissed and leave though like Kyle did, however.  Him and Conor were over by the swing by themselves while everyone was on the trampoline...and they just left, and apparently we're to blame...oh.....ok :-S  I miss Keli.  If Keli woulda been there, the party woulda been a lot kooler.  I had fun anyway....but not as MUCH fun as I could've had.  Oh well.  You win sum, and sum kick you in the nuts.  WHICH HAS HAPPENED TWICE IN ONE MONTH NOW!!!!  MY GOD, why do people kick me in the nuts, it's not very nice.  Then, when I don't like the person very much who did it, people get angry at me for it.  What, I'm supposed to give them a hug for kicking me in the nuts?!?!?!?!  I don't think so....  I think I have ranted on pretty much every topic that I care to spew forth at you.  If I were to rant about EVERYTHING...you would be sitting for a while.... ya...so......I'm just....gonna....go............now...... BYE! *run away*  Spense
