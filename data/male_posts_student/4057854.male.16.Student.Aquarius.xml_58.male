Advertisement CodeWeavers, a company which specializes in software that lets Windows programs run on Linux, told CNet on Monday that it is developing a new version of its software that adds support for Apple's iTunes.  The company said CrossOver Office 3.1 will add support for iTunes and is currently in preview form. The preview is being made available only to existing CrossOver Office customers, though a final version is expected later this year.  Apple's iPod also works natively under Windows and the Mac OS, though the company does not officially support Linux.  "iTunes has been our No. 1 most requested application," CodeWeavers CEO Jeremy White said in a statement. "We remain confident that by the end of 2005, the majority of Windows applications will be supported by CrossOver Office. Until then, we're pleased to be bringing the appeal of iTunes to Linux users through the development of version 3.1."
