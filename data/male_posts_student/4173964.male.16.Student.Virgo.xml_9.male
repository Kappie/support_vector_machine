I went from the Last Samurai (Tom Cruise as the only samurai to survive is strangely depressing) to Dogma (Need i say more) all the way to Freddy vs Jason (You all know who won quitcher bitchin' Freddy's a pansy). Anyhoo... yeah what else. Listened to some Meatloaf... rocked my world.  Goddamn computer keeps crashing. there it goes again. fuck. back... okie dokie  I've had alot of time to think things through today and alot has become clear to me. I've decided to quit smoking and probably drinking after the summer all together. All it does is pollute my body and cloud my judgement and I sure as shit don't need that right now. I see all the people at work who smoke and they're going nowhere in life and that's not where I wanna be at this point.  I'm gonna take a step back and not be so hung up on being single. All things come in due time (teehee I made a double entendre). I don't need the bullshit of a girlfriend right now.  Everybody who's read my other posts and who know me really needs to take it down a notch on the whole Vanya front. Everybodies saying how I'm not over her and I shouldn't bug her and shit like that. All I have to say about that is this... I wrote all that to get it off my chest. I wasn't writing it for you, or her, or anyone else other than me. I had to get somethings off my conscience and this was the only way I knew how. I know how I feel about her and I know how she feels about me and I was fine with that. I wasn't going to say or do anything about it. She's going to fucking Norway in less then a month for fucks sake. What could I expect. Not fucking worth it for such a short time frame. She's a great person and I'd love to continue being friends with her long into the years and I don't want some goddamn teenage crush to get in the way of that.  I'm coming up on my last year of high school and am absolutely terrified. My marks are nearly good enough and I have no idea what I'm going to do. I've always dreamed of being an actor. Not a big huge movie star I've just loved performing for people and trying to make them happy. But now I'm starting to doubt that. My drama teacher has told me I'm capable but no one else seems to think so and, no offence Dean, but he's only a teacher and a great judge of ability *cough Elizabeth cough*. My step-dad is pressuring me inot being a cop. Why the fuck would I want to be one of those? He's utterly convinced he's going to brainwash me into becoming what he wanted to be if his life had gotten so fucked at such a young age.  Funny thing is I've been going through all kinds of shit these past few years and I don't it's really even hit me yet how much it's affected me. A normal person would be a fucking basket case if confronted with half the stuff I've experienced. I don't know what's wrong with me. When my dad kicked me out and did all his bit (someday I'll elaborate) not a tear was shed from my eyes. When my mom told me I was a mistake and she wished she had never had me... still nothing. I think I'm dead inside. I don't know what's wrong with me. I always think about what it's going to take for me to break. I've seen so much in such a short time that I can't even imagine what else life could throw at me. It just sucks that I have nothing to comfort me with. Most people turn to religion but I've never been one to take comfort in words written thousands of years ago that may or may not just be all bullshit. I don't want to dedicate my life to something that may just be the figment of some loonies imagination. Why is God real and Superman isn't? The only proof for either are written word and pictures... what's the difference? I don't know what I saying here. I'm really fucking confused right now. I just want to feel something different for once. I'm tired. Tired of all this. I just need something different.
