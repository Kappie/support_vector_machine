I don't know who the guy on the right is. Btw, this photo was aparently taken quite a few years ago.  Firstly, the original picture:     And my entry for our caption contest:     I thought that was fairly funny.   Anywho, haven't been up to much recently, had to learn about 300 German words, kind of did that, and scribbled my english homework down in about 10 minutes. Haven't done as much revision as I probably should have done, but meh. Started reading 'Interesting Times' by Terry Pratchett. Seems fairly good, I'm about 150 pages in. Discworld books are generally very good, I reccomend them to all. This is it if you are interested:     Cover looks quite nice....  Oh, watched Sleepy Hollow last night, 'twas an ok film, not great. About some headless horseman ghost killing people around a small village in the 18th Century. (I won't bother to put a picture for that). I haven't really got much else to say, so ta ta all.   Playing:  I don't play games  Listening To:  Lighthouse Family CD - 'High'  Watching:  Sleepy Hollow, a View to a Kill this afternoon. Maybe Pearl Harbour tonight.  Annoyed With:  I feel fine for once  Confused About:  How Ichabod can say 'The millenium is almost upon us' in the year 1799...  urlLink www.moviemistakes.com  (I actually noticed that one myself, honest)  Mood:  Fine
