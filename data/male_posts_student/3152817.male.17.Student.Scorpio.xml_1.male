I still can't fully believe that there are people like that in Bedford County.  I thought all of them had moved to the cities, became hippies, or joined www.internationalANSWER.org (ANSWER, for those of you who don't know, is a group of hysterical anti-American commies that are responsible for nearly all the anti-war demonstrations around the country).  If anyone actually knows these people from Hyndman I would love to know who they are.  Maybe they didn't know what they were doing when the registered to vote.  Although, as a keep telling myself, they  are  from Hyndman and that explains a lot.
