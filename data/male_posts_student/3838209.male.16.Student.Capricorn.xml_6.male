Each time i hear of this, it pains me knowing that out there, someone else could be talking behind my back, without me knowing, holding some sort of grudge or dislike towards me. At least if i knew what they had against me, i'd be able to change. But no, we humans would prefer to bad-mouth, and keep it from the person.I'd rather they just tell me straight in the face, and utterly destroy my self-esteem instead of keeping me in the dark, and allowing it to insidiously tear me apart. Yet then, i contradict myself by doing the same. A cowardly act of a wimp, one might say of me....
