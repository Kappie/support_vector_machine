Even when I'm really enjoying myself, there comes a point when it needs to be over with. It's as if you've been lugging the Ring of Doom up a mountain for weeks and you finally toss it into the Crack of Oh Hell With It All Let's Go Have a Beer. An immense weight is lifted from your shoulders.  Or to quote from the new Stepford Wives, "I Love You But Please Die".
