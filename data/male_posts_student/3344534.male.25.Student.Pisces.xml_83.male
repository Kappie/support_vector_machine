"I'm glad I didn't carry my gun. I'd probably be in jail right now." Rocco said. "I believe in the Ten Commandments and I don't appreciate what people like him are doing to my country." yes... it's your country... but it's also close to 300 million other people's country as well.  so what you're saying is... you're the only one that matters?  nice... pretty selfish of you wouldn't you say?  how very christian of you to shoot someone and go to jail.  this country may have been built on the fundamentals of christianity... but the fundamentals of christianity also allow an individual the freedom to choose what your beliefs are (they can be judged right or wrong by God, but the consequences rest on the individual who chooses).  why do conservative christians still not understand that second point?  you all realize we're paying the consequences now for these few right?  very very  urlLink cool .  i hope we continue stem cell research in the future... it could benefit people tremendously.  new york's on heightened  urlLink alert  after some new intelligence was gathered.  for the most part i believe it... but if this ended up coming out 40 years later to be a ploy to get bush reelected playing on the fear of the public i wouldn't be surprised either.  so... what did bush say a few days ago?  'we've turned the corner'?  or something to that extent right?  not according to this  urlLink link  on our gdp, and this  urlLink link  on job growth.  i'm under the belief that growth from tax cuts are not sustainable... it's like a coupon... a one time break that may increase spending in the short term... but having gone through a long period of a recession and then a stagnation of the economy like we have... it will not be a sustainable uptick.  we've already tried supply side economics under reagan... it didn't work... why... WHY on earth would we try it again?  thanks for add to the national debt mr. bush.  thanks for creating burger flipping jobs for people with skills and experience in other industries i'm sure they're thrilled about it... is this really how we're going to grow our country?  nice work!  then there's the mba degree... this thing always fluctuates... not surprisingly with business in general.  i still think it's a valuable degree if combined with the right background... i'm still planning on getting one sometime in the future... i think it's one thing that i am sure about... i'm still leaning more towards the management information systems side of it instead of the straight up management.  though i need to get through this i don't know phase first.  and... seagate is  urlLink awesome .  they just reupped their warranty period of their drives from a measly industry matching of 1-year... up to 5-years.  there was a period when industry average was 3-years... that was as recently as my sophomore year @ nyu... then sometime between then and the recent past, warranties went down to 1-year.  good to see seagate buckin the trend... i think it also says something about their products if they're willing to put themselves out like this.  i commend them for doing it.  5 more days... then 6 more days... i be gone!
