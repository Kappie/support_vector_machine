Funny, how we are revolted the most by the very things that allow us to survive. He was talking. Not really to either of us, and neither of us was really listening, both of us, or myself anyway, off in some other world. We stood there, side by side, pretending to care to what this poor man was saying. I remember not what he said, nor what he looked like. And there we were. My sleeves were rolled up, revealing my forearm. She wore a t-shirt, revealing the better part of her entire arm. I crossed my arms, trying to convey my feelings of impatience to this man who would not cease his jabber. At that momen, she took a step. A small one, but a step none the less. Towards me. She leaned in, and her arm brushed against mine. I felt it coming before it happened, and did not move, neither towards or away from her. Contact was made, and as is expected from accidental physical contact, I was fully prepared for her to move away suddenly. I was pleasantly surprised when she didn't. Rather, she held the position for roughly ten seconds. The man stopped talking, obviously satisfied that he had conveyed the message he was trying to get across. With this, I took a step away, and we both went our seperate ways.
