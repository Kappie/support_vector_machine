I am almost finished with Smile, You are Traveling by Henry Rollins and I started reading Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse. Both enjoyable so far. Palmer actually gave me Siddhartha to read a while back. I just opened it up the other day and I have grabbed it every chance I can. In about an hour, I am going to run up to Evolution Tattoo and get some new shiz done. I was listening to some super sad fariuz earlier. I can just feel the pain in her voice.  There is still much to learn. We are not going in circle, we are going upwards. The path is a spiral; we have already climbed many steps. I found my paints and finished a painting last night. I like it alot. I can't think about these types of things to much. I think it clouds my head; just grab a beer and dive.   Oh, I can't leave this out! Zales sucks. I keep thinking that I will not get out until I find peace at Zales. Dammit mom, thanx for that idea. I can find peace, I can find peace......  Wish me luck!   current mood:  touched
