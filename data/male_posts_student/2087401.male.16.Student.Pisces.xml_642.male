I'm Michael Christie, and this is the longest birthday party of my life.   I'm posting about my really really awesome great day. Because the Christie family has traded in their beaten old sport utility vehicle for...a brand new version of the same vehicle. But it has bucket seats in the back, XM satellite radio and DVD Entertainment for the back seat. I love the car, it is almost as good as an Armada. I'd write an ode to the Tahoe Z71, but this is the slowest internet connection ever, so I can't just run over to RhymeZone.com to find a thing.   Also today was the last day of summer gym, in which I got a B, because I cannot serve a volleyball, shoot a free throw, shoot a layup, run either a mile, 100 meters, 400 meters or two consecutive laps without vomiting all over the track. In fact the warmup almost killed me.   I have nothing to say about finishing gym other than:    Freedom is  mine !   And  I  know   how  I  feel ...   It's  a  new dawn .   It's  a  new day .   It's  a  new life ...for me.   And   I'm   feeling   good .    Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
