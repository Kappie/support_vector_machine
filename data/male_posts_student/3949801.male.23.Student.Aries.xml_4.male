I am just wondering how exactly he was thrown into Iraq. He can try to blame it on bad intelligence or some other totally fucking bogus excuse, but the fact of the matter is he already had the war machine going and he didn't want to stop it. He ignored the UN in their requests to wait until WMD were actually found. Then Bush said fuck you and sent in troops anyways. Our president is a lying motherfucker who doesn't even have the balls to take the blame for his screw ups. I honestly wish that instead of sending US soldiers into Iraq to die for no reason, president Bush would have scheduled a boxing match with Saddam. That seems pretty fair to me. George Dub versus some old ass ruthless dictator. Surely he would win, right? Obviously Bush didn't think so because he sent in other people to do his dirty work. The interests of the wealthy are once again catered to and yet none of their sons and daughters are in Iraq dying. That seems really unfair to me. But what the fuck do I know? One thing for sure, war DOES NOT improve the economy. I am so fucking sick of hearing that war is good for the economy. People making money off this war are the arms, ammunition, and other various weapons manufacturers. Not only are they making money off the war, but they are making money of the deaths of Americans. In closing I would just like to add that America is a fine country and I think it's just unfortunate that we have a government full of greedy assholes that go around and fuck shit up in other countries. Despite the media's lies, most terrorists probably hate the foreign policies and actions that America enacts far more than the American people themselves.
