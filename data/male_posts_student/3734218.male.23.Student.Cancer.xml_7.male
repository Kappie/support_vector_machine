Fun stuff.  Not.  Anyway, my new project is a from scratch mud server in Cocoa.  So far, it's good fun!  All I have is a couple classes that constitute a very simple multiplexing and non-blocking telnet server that does nothing.  Well, it parses through the input and puts it into an array to use later, but that's about it.  Just laying the ground work!
