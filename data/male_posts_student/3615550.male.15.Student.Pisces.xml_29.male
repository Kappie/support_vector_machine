It appears, however, that law and order have for once prevailed.  The Supreme Court today ruled that the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance are constitutional--well, sort of.  The man who started this case, Michael Newdow, claimed that his daughter (a Christian, no less) should not have to say the Pledge of Allegiance since he perceived the words "under God" to be a government endorsement of religion (Oh, the horror!).  Anyway, Mr. Newdow only has partial custody of his daughter, and the girl and her mother like the pledge the way it is.  Because of Mr. Newdow's lack of custody (he only sees his daughter 10 days a month), the Supreme Court ruled that he has no standing to speak for his daughter.  Said Michael Newdow: "I may be the best father in the world," adding "She spends 10 days a month with me. The suggestion that I don't have sufficient custody is just incredible. This is such a blow for parental rights."   No, actually it's a blow to the rights of people who try to change the meaning of the Constitution without using the voting process.  Mr. Newdow, if we wanted you to make our laws for us, we would have elected you to public office.  This is a democracy, my friend, and in a democracy, all the people make the laws, not just one insane athiest who thinks he is infallible.  If you want that, you can move to Cuba.
