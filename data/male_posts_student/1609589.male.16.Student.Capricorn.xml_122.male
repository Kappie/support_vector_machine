Meyer, with the subject "I saw you in the chatroom" and nothing in the body of the message.  The next one was from my e-mail address again, and the subject was "your password" , but again, there was nothing in the body of the message.  I was about to delete it, but then I looked at the filesize of the message. 122k. The one from Georgette was 1k. How could it be 122k if there is less information than the other one? If you have any ideas, tell me- I'm still confused.  UPDATE- i tried to experiment, and i forwarded it to myself... and it gave me a syntax error with a wierd thing in the address bar that i've never seen... cid:C16Td4OM3f2JhiH3.  Could this be the password? I'm still confused, but I'm starting to think this is something big.
