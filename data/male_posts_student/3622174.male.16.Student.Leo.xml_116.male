It's a long tip, I'll go over it tomorrow.  It got a new name in the process, and the site will relaunch tomorrow.  It's now called Digital Lust, and it's going to be much better than before.  It's going to cover more of the interweb, including web videos, cartoons, and more...it's going to be much bigger, and you guys will definitely love it.  There will continue to be 4 posts a day, and there will be more to see than ever before.  Be sure to check out Digital Lust when it launches tomorrow.  All the posts from bagel.tech are going to be imported into the new site, and the search bars and everything are going to be there, ready to be used.  And, in other news, my bad day seems to getting better (and, right before I head to bed), and hopefully, tomorrow will be a much better day.  After tomorrow's Digital Lust updates, I'm going to go out to my friend's bike track and just chill for a few hours.  I've needed to get away for such a long time, and I need to tomorrow, or else I will officially declare this summer to be the worst summer ever.  Digital Lust, anyway, will feature all new content, like cartoons, web videos, and even game reviews and previews.  I'm going to make the Gmail Giveaway at both sites, and the Blog of Bagel Gmail Giveaway will happen after the Digital Lust Gmail Giveaway, when I get a second set of invites.  You have to see the new content that I have planned, because it's going to be bigger than ever before.  Digital Lust is coming, and be sure to check it out.    No Late Night Bloggin' tonight, I need to get some sleep.  So, tomorrow, be sure to check out Digital Lust for updates, and more from me here.  Until next time, adios.
