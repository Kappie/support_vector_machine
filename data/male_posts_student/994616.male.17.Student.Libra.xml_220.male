I would also be fine with that too, except for the combination of the two, that's the bad part. So I inform you that we can't have a relationship.  Well, unless she's a beard.   She can't be a beard though. A beard is another accessory, so it should make you look more attractive, right? However he had a tall, blonde beard. He is a short brunette, they totally don't match. he's thick and muscled, she is paper thin. It so doesn't work.   Sincerly You're rabid Fangrrl*, Mike  *According to Caroline and the 2001 censor of panda's  Hmm seeing steve with woman (that doesn't match) and then going home to see a romantinc comedy was a REALLY bad idea. Now i'm even MORE depressed.
