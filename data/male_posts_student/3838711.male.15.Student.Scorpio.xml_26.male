Sherman really the cock-eyed sia.. see some NVSS come out from NEL, den he hurriedly grabbed my hp to call Karie.. instead while he finding the number Karie appeared from behind.. LoL~ Went to KFC to get lunch.. Basket.. i sick still go.. haha.. whack la, who cares...  den we go shopping for Jarael's track pants, and off to mos burger's outdoor seats to sit and wait for Jarael's "crush" to call or sms her... then we go le.. I say wanna go toilet, after come out all gone lo.. wah.. super PS sia...lol~  hmm, today felt a bit better and more expressive in front of Karie, i talked quite a bit i suppose.. but still she didnt look at me directly or wadever lor.. haha.. still the same.. hopes she like my present :P (a necklace with her horoscope Leo on it..) Maybe its the fact that i committed myself to "me and her isnt possible" attitude, then today treated her like normal fren, so i could express myself better ? i dunno... just have this gut feeling.  Come back liao, Sherman on MSN suanned me seh... Love ROX! thing is... he know i lacking it... sigh.. but i know he do it in the name of fun... so nvm la, let it go hee.. his jokes have led me to lose the girls fee for the movie tix, basket, shout so loud, treat them all la....
