It's going to be very hard for me to do this, but I'm going to try and provide a glimpse as to what the mini-series is on the surface.  It's basically about a gay guy who has AIDS, his lover (who kind of leaves him), another guy who's been "heterosexual" all his life but finally admits he's gay (he, I believe, gets AIDS as well), his crazy wife (with great comic relief), and this other high-powered closeted gay guy who's the first to get AIDS.  It basically details their struggles, discoveries, etc., with some hilarious fantasy sequences dispersed throughout the chapters.  But on the inside, it means so much more, and has been powerful enough to raise questions about society and its perceptions and its systematics inside of me.  The movie takes place in the 1980's when AIDS mania was starting to go crazy and homophobia ran rampant among society.  There's so much symbolism and philosophy in the movie that it's nearly too much to comprehend, from society's belief in ultra-conservatism yet with ultra-liberalism coming out of the closet as well.  I can't wait until next Sunday when the last three chapters are shown, because this is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time (there have been two others, "Happiness" and another one I whose name I can't think of; both of which have been on HBO).  In a day and age of sight gags, one-liners, and plot-based movies, it's quite rare for a movie to actually make me think, but this one has.  Many of HBO's original movies and series do, so I encourage anyone who has HBO to check out their programming.  It's incredible.  A lot of it makes me look at life in a completely different way, which is awesome.  And now I have to go do homework, which is such a complete contrast to what I've done for the last 3 hours that I want to either regurgitate, cry, scream, or do something totally crazy simply because the two events simply cannot be juxtaposed.  One week more until the finale of quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever made...
