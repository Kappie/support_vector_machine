Perhaps the first thing that strikes you at B-school is the way it questions your traditional methods of learning.Most of us have been used to a system of Teacher-Student Instruction method where the teacher lectures and the student learns.        But at my B-school there is a heavy emphasis on Case Study Method and Group Presentations.This brings us to the age old debate of which is better : Case Study Vs Lecture Method. There is no prefect answer for this. Some Schools like Harvard,Darden (U of Virginia) follow predominantly the Case Study Method , while others like Yale,Carnegie-Mellon follow the Lecture Method.       Of course I have no clue which is the best method.But found this  urlLink URL  about the teaching styles in Top 25 US B-Schools.
