I just dont feel any shit about the clan anymore.............No sense OF belonging...No loyalty...NOTHING MAN.....I dont know...Fucking Confused now...the Idea of freelancing is cool?  AHH im drifting away......I mean...What Difference does it make? I dont feel that Im needed anymore.People are better than me? Im taking the game like a pussy. But again. Am i fucking irresponsible to leave now? HAI~~~~~~
