Then, that night, we stole Dan's electric bass and formed some sort of pathetic band practice between Bass and Drums (Caver on bass, me on set.) That was terribly interesting. We tried to play Time Is Running Out by Muse, and it actually sounded pretty good. Except for our wanna be vocals. Those were just funny. We also had no lead guitar when I played drums.. I pretty much just switched back and forth. But that is a sweet song. Sunday totally blew. I had to play at graduation.. ugh. Listening to 392 (even though that's kind of a short list compared to some years) names being read off in alphabetical order is not fun. Sometimes, I just wish they would switch it up and name a 'Z' inbetween 'M' and 'O' just to see if people were actually awake and listening instead of just rampantly applauding. And now, I'm here, trying to finish my gravely overdue lab (on which I'm now procrastinating and blogging instead) which is worth 4% of my grade in Chem and will boost my grade from a B to an A-. AH!!!!! And then there's finals. Not fun. Not at all...
