He might not be as good as Dominic, but still, Lamar is able to distribute information out to us in a very civil matter, and his dog runs with us too.  FOUR DAY WEEKEND =)  Jeff D and I were driving home from edsel adn all of a sudden his rear passenger window shattered. For like no reason. The music was not at all loud. We're thinking someone threw a rock at it, but either way, it stinks.  So yeah, tommarow im supposed to do something, but i forgot. I think phil is gonna be gone somewhere...maybe not, but i gotta mow the lawn tommarow and eat right now, so ill c yall later
