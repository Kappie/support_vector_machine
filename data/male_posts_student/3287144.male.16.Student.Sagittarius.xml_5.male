Most notably is my newly found cruel hobby of engaging arguments with argumentative people who don't have a chance of winning the said argument. It's cruel I know but secretly fun.  I had another dream which I can recall again, I don't know whether it is the fact that I am recording them that helps me remember them or what but here is last nights; I found myself in a shop with my father, the shop sells a variety of 1930s toys, especially models of cars, boats and trains, the shelves are dusty and the shop keeper wears old clothes and looks tired, I don't know why we went in there but when we come out again we have bought the shop. The next day I start work in the shop and decide that it needs to be cleaned and that way it can become successful, I start my attempts at cleaning it but I get tired and put on an old jumper and over the coming days I find myself transforming in to the old shop keeper. Well in other news I bought myself a replacement copy of Dracula [Bram Stoker] as I had lost my original copy, Â£1.50 - a bit of a bargain really. I have decided to re-read it as well, beats revision...  Music: The Rolling Stones - Sympathy for the Devil Mood: Aloof Site:  urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/.../...
