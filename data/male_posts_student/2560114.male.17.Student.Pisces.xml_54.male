I dont think i can get into a college jus by education alone, cuz our school is stupid, im like 80 out of 698 , but thats pretty good. But i know its a given that im gonna go to college in boston but i dont want too, i want to stay somewhere close to home and where the weather is nice or like hawaii. Then i have a shit load of hw to do, like us history and english and chem...hw sux ass, i wanted my senior year to b kick back but since im retarded im takin the required classes i need and im takin 2 math classes pre-calc and statistics ap. Well imma write other stuff later...out
