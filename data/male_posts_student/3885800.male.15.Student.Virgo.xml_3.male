I first heard of them when coming out of the Taking Back Sunday/The Used/Blink concert when someone gave me a "MIT City Swearing Dictionary".   After speaking to Mike, and getting a taste of the music, I only got more interested. MIT City likes to interact with its fans on msn and is currently building a fan base. There music is original and they arent afraid to explore with there sound. You can check out some MP3's of there music on there website, read there bio, or browse through pictures.   Mike is currently booking local shows with MIT City in the GTA. They have an upcoming show on August 7th, so everyone should come and check it out  MIT City, artists of the month
