According to mensa.org, I have a high chance of passing the entrance exam. 25 out of 30, but I skipped a couple math questions.  Today I discovered that I really  did  have an innate talent of rocking, and I wasn't just trying to fool myself. I've adopted a new policy of bringing my acoustic wherever I go.  I've got to buy Hobie a birthday present. It will be the precious gift of music. It has to be something that he'll like, yet I won't feel bad about buying him. He took well enough to last year's CD, and I'm going to try for something more esoteric this year. Sadly, Hobe didn't take to punk. Also, having seen the effects of exposing John to my music, I'm going to forego getting him anything I like a lot. Plus, he hates the Clash. Even more blasphemous, he hates the Casualties. The Casualties, man.    What the Hobster might like (if he opened his mind and gave it a chance): Sublime Bob Marley and the Wailers Atom and his Package Wesley Willis  Well, not Wesley.  What do you buy a emo-indie fan who hates anything musically interesting?  Ben Kweller, that's what.  I already bought that for John for  his  birthday, even though I could've easily just got him a Souls or a LTJ CD. What a waste of a present.  On Thursday, me and John took my mom's van over to my grandma's house. Now, I wouldn't say that I was driving  completely  out of control, but it was close. It was the most sublime driving experience ever, and now I would drive that van all day long if I could. It ate John's Ben Kweller CD. Anyway, I ended up fishtailing all over my grandma's lawn and tearing it up, which wasn't my fault at all. I simply wasn't used to driving it.  If I don't find anything cool tomorrow at Best Buy tomorrow, I'll consult with some real emo-indie music jerk snobs.  See you, Space Cowboy.
