So first in Ms. Massey all I did was talk with Jessica, Tim P., and that other girl but I forgot her name. Then in Ms. Castro....oops I mean Ferrer we all threw paper at each other and got in trouble. Then Tim W. flipped a desk over and was standing on it and Krystal pushed him and he fell and smashed his chin on one of the bars! He had a huge gash on the side of his chin and you could see the bone. Krystal was so sorry and we were like messing with her saying how his parents could press charges or something like that lol. I just talked to him and he said he had to get five stitches....ouch. Then in Mr. Moser I got sad 'cause we were all ther but then next to me there was Stacey's extra seat. But anyway, we had a really gay test. We had to write the numbers and colors of all of the languages we learned...but he ended up giving us all of the answers lol. We also had to write a five paragraph essay on the language of Japanese and I was like yeah right, I aint doing that! Thats it for today.
