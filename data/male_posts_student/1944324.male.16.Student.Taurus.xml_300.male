I mean, conversations lead to it sometimes, but it seems weird to say to some people, hey, I have a girlfriend now!  Odd conversation starter, ya know? Props to Erin for an extremely long, extremely funny post.  It was so Random and out there, that I thought michael was writing it until i saw your name at the end.  Everybody check out the lobby! Its on the links, its my new journal site.   Hey, I have a girlfriend now!
