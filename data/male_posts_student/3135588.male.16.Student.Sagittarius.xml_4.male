Who knows wether it's going to take off and be a roaring sucess, (Zoe) or if it will just curl up and die. (Dont worry trowell I still read ures!) Depending on wether I can be bothered to do even more work today, you lucky people may have a real post from me.   Wont that be exiting.  *smiles expectantly*  Enjoi, Jim x
