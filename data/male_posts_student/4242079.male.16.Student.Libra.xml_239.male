Had no gas, figured I'd pull over. $280 dollars for running a stop sign these days. He didn't give me that ticket though, just a "failure to produce drivers license". My wallet was in my pants. I think I'm going to start leaving my ID in my car. Anyway, make sure you have your licence with you, $189 for that one. If only it had been Cst. Bengert instead of Baker. Meh. I'll survive, I have until December 29th to pay up, and Christmas paycheques are coming.  Jingle Bells, Chequebook swells, laughing all the way...   That was on my way to Kylie's house. w00t w00t, yo!  I must say, it's nice, and rather refreshing, this thing with Kylie. Sigh. *enter*  Well, I'm off to work, even though the mall is closed at the moment because it has absolutely no power. Hurrah.
