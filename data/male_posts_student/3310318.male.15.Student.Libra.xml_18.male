Guess it wasn't enough to take up some of my love cause you're so hard to trust Did I not tell you that I'm not like that girl? The one who gives it all away  [Chorus:] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Don't think that your charmin the fact that your arm is now around my neck I got you in my pants I'll have to kick your ass and make you never forget I'm gonna ask you to stop, thought I liked you a lot, but I'm really upset Get out of my head get off of my bed yeah thats what I said Did I not tell you that I'm not like that, the one who, throws it all away  [Chorus] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  This guilt trip that you put me on won't, mess me up I've done no wrong Any thoughts of you and me have gone away  [Chorus] Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time? Did you think that I was somethin I was gonna do and cry? Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Better off that way I'm better off alone anyway
