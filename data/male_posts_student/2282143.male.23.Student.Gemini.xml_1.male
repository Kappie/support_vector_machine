So much to my mother's dismay, she came over.  Actually she wasnt too bad.  She wasnt as psycho as she always is, and she kept her mouth shut to my mom, so it worked out ok.  But then I got to go see Sammy's family.  Luke and Chelsea are so damn cute its not even funny.   Went to Tae Kwon Do yesterday for the heck of it.  Nothing was scheduled, but went anyways.  It pays to have a key...  Worked on iron body and staff.  Getting better.  John showed up with the kids, so I got to play tag with his kids for a while, and he taught me some more cool stuff.   Holiday Magic was amazing.  This year, its massive.  Totally decked out.  Grounds must have busted their asses to get it done too.  Beautiful.  Anyways, found out alot more about the wolf incident, unfortunately, in the event anyone from the zoo happens to read this, Im keeping my mouth shut because I dont wanna lose my job over this.  Read the papers if you want any information.  Or IM me...  Well, off to my normal Saturday routine.  Feeling a bit lazy and sore today, so I think TKD is off the menu for my morning activities.  Maybe I can finally settle down and watch the 12 extra hours of the Two Towers on DVD.  Fun times...
