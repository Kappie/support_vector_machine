I am listening to Ocean Avenue by yellow card. It is rather good. buy their album.   I tried self tattooing. It doesnt work very well. It hurts alot too. I need to go urinate. Have a good time doing whatever you're doing. Squeet..no love bites on jo please. he bruises like a peach. it's an emo kid thing.
