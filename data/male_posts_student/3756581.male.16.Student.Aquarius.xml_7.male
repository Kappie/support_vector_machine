This is a place where I, Whitey McCracka, can rant and rave to anyone who may run across my little space on the world wide web. Now before I start some actual posting let me tell you a little about myself.  I am a 16 year old Junior in High School and I am extremely politically active, as you will certainly find out later! I go by Whitey McCracka, though it is not my real name, just a nick name. None of you will EVER get my real name unless I already know you...in which case you will not need it. As for the origins of this name, it comes from my physical appearance, white skin, white hair, all white; hence WHITEY. As for McCracka...anyone who is up on racial epitephs you are well aware that the term "Cracker" is a slur for people of fair complexion. Now I am also of Irish Heritage, hence the "Mc." Now if you put that all together what do you get??? Thats right! Whitey McCracka!  Now that we know where I got my name, lets go into why I started this Blog. As many of you know, there is a very large, if not huge, left-leaning media bias. How many of you know about the Prison Abuse Scandles? All of you, of course, unless you have been in a coma for the past 2 months. Now, how many of you know about the Sarin Gas that exploded in Iraq a couple of weeks ago? *cricket chirps* Thats what I thought. The current Media is absolutly HELL BENT making Bush, The War on Terror, and Right-Wingers in General look bad. Well, folks, your looking at one of the few, one of the proud, yes, you guessed it, this is a Right-Wing Blog! All Liberals, Greens, Progressives, Socialists and Communists are all welcome, but be warned, some of the things you'll read here, you may not like, you may not agree with, and you just hate all together, but these are things I think need to be said, so I'm going to say them.  Now that you have the skinny on me and why I'm here...lets get to business shall we???  PS: I would like to thank Paul Motes For the term "The Reaganista"...Pure genius my friend!
