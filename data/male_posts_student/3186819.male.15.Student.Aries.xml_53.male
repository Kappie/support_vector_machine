But modern society has us seeing fairy godmothers as magical beings waving wands who appear mysteriously and sing    "Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Put 'em together and what have you got bibbidi-bobbidi-boo   Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo It'll do magic believe it or not bibbidi-bobbidi-boo   Salagadoola means mechicka booleroo But the thingmabob that does the job is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo   Salagadoola menchicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo Put 'em together and what have you got bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi-boo    But whens the last time you heard a "generous friend or benefactor" sing that? Tell me! WHEN! Has the definition of fairy godmother changed in the last two generations with the hour hour photo, disney-filled, rubber stamp education era? Or is Disney at fault??? Do we need to update the definition of fairy godmother? And what about fairy godfathers! There is no such definition. I've always assumed the Fairy Godfather is the leader of the Gay Mafia! When will the definitions grow to meet the world? WHEN!!!!! Disney est loco!
