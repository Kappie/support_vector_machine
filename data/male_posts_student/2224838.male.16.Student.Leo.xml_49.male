The first few episodes were really funny and then, of course, the last couple became very tense and drawn out. I thought the actor that played the big, fat, obnoxious fiancé did a great job of being big, fat, and obnoxious, and at the end, explaining the whole situation to the girl's family. If you haven't seen the show, just be like Nate and try to download all of the episodes. It's actually quite good.
