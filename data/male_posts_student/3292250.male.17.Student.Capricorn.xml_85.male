So yesterday we went to Old Navy, because I love their stuff and they were having a big sale before all the hot new Fall line comes in. Needless to say, I loaded up, and looks damn fabulous if-I-do-say-so myself. My new expanded wardrobe includes:     urlLink The best jeans I have ever owned ! They're hot and make me look hot.    urlLink Some Cargo pants . They're comfy and cute, so I thought why not. (Mine are in Thatch)    urlLink Pair of Khaki shorts , in Blot.   A button-front shirt I can't seem to find online.   Yet another shirt I can't find online. Both of these "mystery shirts" are cute. I swear.   My favorite purchase of the day:  urlLink my first Messenger Bag ! I've wanted one of these for years, and this one is so fabulous.   Other items: vintage-style "D-ring" belt and a tanktop.    All in all it was a very good shopping trip, and I can now go on a trip and start school with some fabulous new clothes.
