I think I'm really gonna cram in some writing this week. My goal is that in the next week or so I'll have my papers for 603 and 690F done. 8 pages in a week should not be a problem. Actually I hope to get it done this weekend... maybe. That gives me one week of revisions for those papers.  For 602, I'll probably take an incomplete, but I hope to have at least half of the writing done before I leave here.  I made some chicken today... it was alright. I think I've decided that I like chicken fried and in sandwich format the most. That is nuggets, strips, and fried pieces, or a grilled breast in a sandwich. Well... El Pollo Loco's chicken tostada salad is pretty damn good.  **
