(to ure right) i think our board is gonna be flamed. apparently boonshings pictures are not very well liked. oh well.what can i say? apocalypse and the guy hu cant find his daddy have every right to be pissed (whichever school they are from)! i mean, if i were from chs, i wud be quite pissed too. it would be better if u guys stopped posting INANE posts like "ri sux" on the tag board. and 10 times at that. i have NO trouble reading, thank u very much, id like to say the same abt u too. if u want to flame, do it with more finesse.   A QUICK TUTORIAL TO FLAMING   1. never leave ure real name  u haf grasped this fast. the more stupid the better. eg. apocalypse: oh u are gonna destroy me. help! who's ure daddy: a good name to taunt ure opposition by questioning hu their daddy is.   2. go round the bush   "actually ri is quite good la. just that we're better.see! other people are braver than them,proving soby jumping down 3 stories, so u see its always the balless people who whine."  3. sarcasm would be lovely  "OK LA. ri is DAMN good."  so basically blogs are meant to put down our true feelings and the colourful side of our lives. if anyone feels offended because of the content, then dont whine. since u can bitch and whine abt our blog on ure blog. got it? =)
