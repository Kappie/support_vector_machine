Since I am not into my hardcore political frame of mind right now, and am more reflective about life, I think I should share those thoughts with people. It is an experiment to see what kind of difference it will make. After all taking back public space from the university or corporations is an important part of the anti-globalization movement.  Here are some of the poems I am thinking about chalking:  Like a dying rose so too will pain wilt away. Clean rains will moisten the heart's hunger. Red Roses of Love will bloom again. Pain's ashes become a new desire's fertilizer. Blacker the ash... Redder the Rose...  Here is another one:  Lost in my thoughts, Swimming in my past, Dream's desires are a painful fire.  And another one:  Have you ever felt black rain? It only pours when lover's hearts are torn asunder. Lust and fate take all they can plunder. Rumblings of heartache's thunder, No rhyme can fix the heart's broken blunder.  And the last one for today:  When i talk to you, all i can think of is how true my feelings are for you.  When i look at you, what i hear, is something that takes away my fears.  In those echoes of my heart, lays the truth of you.  Behind each beat awaits something for you.  All i can do, is ask you to brush aside the curtains of my soul, and look inside.  I could not help myself with one more:  The present has no meaning for me. My thoughts, heart, and dreams are in the past dreaming of her. All that is left of me in the now is my skin, bones, and flesh. I am yesterday trapped in the living body of tomorrow.  ----   So some of these poems I do not think really belong to me as their inspiration rests in the soil of the love I had. I suppose if I represent a flower (or a weed depending if you like the poem), she would be the gardener. If those words were buried inside of me, then it was her love and care that brought them to the surface. (And obviously the poems reflect different emotions at different times in my life.)  So back to this chalking experiment, I have no idea what affect it will have on the campus if any. But I would like to think it would inspire other lovers to look deeper into their relationships and to take joy in their love as well. I am sure if I keep doing this, some of the poems will be political as well, although the one political poem I did a year ago on Palestine, I thought at least, was awful so maybe I will keep those poems in my head J
