This entire summer was focused on about 4 different things: 1. Writing 2. Depression 3. Family 4. Katie (You'd have to ask me about it in person)  So at this point, along with all the other kids in this city, I'll take the longest walk of my life (except for death row...) to the bus stop and wait in front of poisonous Nightshade plants for the bus that will carry me to the mental prison of censorship and sadness.  Sorry, too bleak.  Let me try again:   "Gee golly!  We get to go back to school! YAY!  I can’t wait to start learning with all those warm, happy, loving teachers!  Just waiting for the bus will fill me with such anticipation that I wont be able to keep an ear-to-ear grin off my face!"   And that's why you shouldn’t take ecstasy...
