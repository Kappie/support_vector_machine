You see, my family and I went to this cook-out thingy at my sister's friend's house. Yeah, so we were there till late and I didn't get to update becasue of getting up early for running and it sorta goes on like that.   So yesterday was the fourth of July thing. The cook-out was... well... let's just say that it wasn't as fun as partying with n00bs in FFXI. I tried to invite anybody that I could (then it wouldn't have been so utterly terrible to withstand...). Alex was too "sick" to go. Sahil was "busy"... and James had family "bonding" to do... So, I went alone... We did all of the usual boring stuff. Sit around and talk (talking did not involve me in any fun way whatsoever...), eat, watch fireworks, and do other random stuff that American families do to celebrate the day of Independence.   Wow, it sometimes hurts to laugh so hard... The crazy conversations that I love to have with people (mostly James o.O). Yep... so... It's just me sitting here... Being bored... Well, not really, I just can't focus on writing.   Meh... life's creul twists are only made worth it by the fortuitous ones that happen...   Yeah, well, I found a new craze to myself. Called FFX!!! Yeah, stop playing one, start playing another Final Fantasy. I love the game. It really is fun, because I just imported all of the Al Bhed Primers that I had in my old game (being all of them ;P) and now I fully understand what everyone is saying. There are some plot holes that are kinda weird when you PERFECTLY understand Al Bhed, but I don't really care. I can't wait to get to the end and become all super godly powerful ^^. Lalalala.   You know (probably not), I'm actually kind of tired. I feel really pansy right now... I'm so out of it... I haven't played DDR in so long. I really need my metal pad, but birthday is so far away... I'll just have to live it out. Hopefully I can get everyone to the arcade sometime so that I don't stab out my eyes in the lacking of dancing-ness...steth...   Okay, well, I think I'm done. I'm already like 24 hours behind on this thing, so the faster I publish, the faster it'll be... uh... published... Well, I'll talk to you all on Wednesday ^_^.   PS: Yes! You heard right! Wednesday, it will not be on Thursday (I think >.>;)
