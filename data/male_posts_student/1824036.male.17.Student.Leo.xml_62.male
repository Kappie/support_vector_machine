This site is pretty cool! You enter your money and see where it goes. That simple. I also rented 3 movies. Vanilla Sky [w/ Tom Cruise], Undisputed [w/ Wesley Snipes], and One Hour Photo [with Robin Willians]. I have not seen any of these movies, but  urlLink Chad  told me that 'One Hour Photo' was pretty good. So I will see!
