It does all so happen my mother was going all day to buy the new furnitures for the appartment, so if i wanted decent stuff, i had to go and select it myself, thing that i did. We shopped for like 6 hours straight. We stopped at a cool restaurant with excellent food. Met  Josee Roberto , teacher at Americana, he will have a meeting with me for english classes (Godamn it).   You probably won't believe it, but i actually studied today! I'm proud of myself, finally something i can achieve! I wish it could be like that everyday!   Also another hard thing to believe, as you probably noticed, the banner has appeared. I'm still trying to remove the google add and maybe restructure, thanks to the help of my comrad  Zyphern .   Spoke a lot with  Mishaga . She is a bit sad, i will do my best to make her smile as much as possible.   Tests tomorrow, i hope to get good grades for a change.  Regards,  Zephyr
