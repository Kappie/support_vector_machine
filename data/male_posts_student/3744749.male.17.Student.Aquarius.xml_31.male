It just kind of makes you simultaneously warm and fuzzy inside and really really fucking depressed. I think I'm secreting some chemical that attracts crazies. First the manny, cop hating old woman, then the volatile homeless prophet who accused me of sitting outside of peet's without coffee and being "brainwashed by the man". And now the goddamn taco bell clerk guy who, before giving me my shitty food, insisted on showing me and giving longwinded commentary on every motherfucking one of his tattoos and stab wounds he got in prison.  genuphobia - the fear of knees. pogonophobia - the fear of beards. phengophobia - the fear of daylight. keraunothnetophobia - the fear of falling satellites.
