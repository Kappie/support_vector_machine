We're talking around just a tad after 9PM when I clocked out.    The Hooter's across the street from where I work shows all the WWE PPV's, so that's where I went.  I apparently had good timing.  Just as I walked in, I heard the glass shatter and Stone Cold's music hit.  I had arrived just in time for the Lesnar-Goldberg match.  (I hadn't heard the  urlLink Lesnar rumors  until after I got home...)  Lemme tell you, Hooter's was packed.  And full of rowdy wrestling fans as well.  Of course, they were all marking out huge for ol' Whiskerbiscuits Goldberg (he lives in Atlanta).  I for one was stunned at the easy win that Goldberg got, considering he's leaving WWE for Japan after WM.  Then again, so is Brock.  Who knew?  (He'll be back...)  Anyway, I'm not going to recount the entire card here.  You can go to  urlLink PWTorch  for the full blow-by-blow.    When the Old School Undertaker came out (and man, did he ever slim down?  I swear that's the slimmest I've ever seen the man.  I guess that's what happens when you're buried alive and only manage to rise from the dead 5 months later)Hooter's went nuts for the Dead Man.  I was a bit disappointed in the quickness of the match, but hey, what do you expect from a man who's spent the last five months dead?    I was pleased with the Eddie Guerro-Kurt Angle match.  I haven't mentioned it here, but I've been saying that I want to see Eddie run with the belt for a good while.  Along with Rey-Rey, he can really help pull the Hispanic audience into WWE.  Plus, if there's any man who deserves to be WWE Champ, it's Eddie.  Wait...There's one other guy who deserves to run with the title...   BENOIT!  BENOIT!!  BENOIT!!!  My hat goes off for the Canadian Crippler.  Talk about a "smart" wrestling fan marking out to HHH tapping out to the Crippler Crossface.  I spilled my beer.  All of Hooter's went nuts as well.  The next PPV is Backlash, and it emanates from Edmonton Alberta, which happens to be the hometown of who?  You guessed it...Chris "The Rabid Wolverine" Benoit.  Looks like I'll be headed up to hooter's in a few weeks!
