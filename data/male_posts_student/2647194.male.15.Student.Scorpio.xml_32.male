No one's able to go anywhere, and I'm stuck in my room listening to music, and not wanting to go to drums and piano tonight. Oh-and then I have to complete the stupid English interview tonight with my piano teacher...what fun. God I hate English...  This spring break has pretty much sucked so far-I haven't been able to do anything out of the ordinary yet, and its already going on halfway through. Some of the snow's still around, which I want erradicated from this area, badly. Plus, its not warm enough to do stuff yet...grr....  And I thought rainy days were depressing. Its amazing how boring a sunny day can be when you've got nothing in the world to do.  "Well it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again And it seems like I'll be wearin' the same ol' chains Good will conquer evil and the truth will set you free Then I know someday I'll find the key Then I know somewhere I'll find the key Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long And it seems the game I played has made you strong Well when the game is over, I won't walk out a loser And I know that I'll walk out of here again And I know that someday I'll walk out of here again  But now I'm trapped...Oh yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah!  Now it seems like I've been sleepin' in your bed too long And it seems like you've been meanin' to do me harm But I'll teach my eyes to see beyond these walls in front of me And someday I'll walk out of here again Yeah I know someday I'll walk out of here again  But now I'm trapped...Oh yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah!  Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long And it seems the game I played has made you strong  Because I'm trapped...Oh yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah!  I'm trapped...Oh yeah yeah! Trapped...Oh yeah yeah Trapped...Oh yeahhhhhh Trapped....oh yeahhhh I'm trapped."
