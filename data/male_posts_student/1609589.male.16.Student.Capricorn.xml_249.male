It's a GAME, which means it is supposed to be fun. And then your team loses and you're dissapointed, and you go home and cry like the moron you are, and I laugh that half the stadium got their hearts broken.  I fucking hate the superbowl. At least it wasnt in dallas this year, jesus christ that was the worst. You fucking retards need to die.
