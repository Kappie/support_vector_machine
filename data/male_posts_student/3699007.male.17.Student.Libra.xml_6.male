I was looking for her 1985 rusted out Firebird in the parking lot, but had to settle for a rusted out early 90's Toyota to laugh at.  Anyway, I do not understand why some 40+ year old women think they can look like they did when they were 20 and why some even try.  But this woman was really bad.  I wouldn't even go out of the house with my mother if she looked like that.  And what was she buying, you might ask?  You guessed it...Clorox.  More later.  I'm off to go sit on my ass some more since it's summer, which is totally awesome.
