Some things have actually changed since I last posted. Well, for starters, i have once less firend in this city, because my friend Pritam left for Trivandrum and TCS training last week. He has called a few times and his stories seem to oscillate between multicoloured LUNGIS and topless women. So I really don't know what to say to that. I am sure he is enjoying himself. Best of luck !! Buddy... Nearer to home, two very significant things have happened, firstly, remember the project that I referred to in my last post, well it has been approved. What that means is that being the Project Manager, I will have very little time to spare for the next few weeks... maybe months. Which brings me to my next point, which is that the Sims have started at IMs, so even Sundays are no longer fun days. It's going to be really difficult to juggle between these two things, both important, both critical. Other than that... not much has been happening, except that it's probably finalized that we will be shifting to our new house by the end of this month. And here's a speciall message to all those people who can't chat with the people they would like to because, Yahoo Messengers are not allowed in offices, please feel free to use the chatroom, that i have added to my site. This is my small tribute to pining hearts all around me... I wish I had somebody who pined for me... someday...
