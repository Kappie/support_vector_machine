I woke up and had lunch. I was supposed to pass to lil' piggy his fnn's stuffs today, but he didn't inform me of the changes, so I juz waited till like 2:30pm. I smsed him first, but after 15mins when there was no reply, I gave him a call. Ce Rong answered the phone and said lil' pig was bz ordering smt. He said they were at Jurong Point and I was like ok . . . . . . ? He told me not to wait for tt lil' pig cuz he probably won't be collecting it frm me today. 10mins later, I received an sms frm lil' pig and well tt's bout' exactly wad he said.  Yea, wad a great way to start the day huh? I missed an appointment juz to stay home and wait for his reply, and wad happens? Haha, wad a joke man. I decided to get my hair cut since I had already missed my appointment to go out. I felt realli gd after getting my hair cut realli short, it seems to remove the sorrows tt I've been hafing for the past 2 days. And if tt wasn't enough? Pool was! Haha, I met anwar in the evening to thrash my anger out. Not on him, but on the balls. I imagined tt the balls were ppl I hated and juz whacked them realli hard. It realli worked, I managed to perform betta than usual too. L0L!  Well, I'm basically listening to music now, thinking and at the same time bloggin. Music realli seems to calm me down in one way or another. I'm juz thinking to myself rite now bout how I feel. Although they might not treat me well or treat me as a bro or wadeva, I dun care. I juz haf a personality to treat ppl well, even if they dun. It sucks, yes, definitely, but wad can I do. Yes, I definitely think tt I'm the one at lost, but den again, it was be tt acknowledged them, so I hafta live wif it. I always look at the gd side of ppl rather than the bad. So, I'll juz think bout' happy memories I haf wif them rather than any bad stuffs. Well tt's bout it I guess, cya! =]
