Dear Miriam,     I miss you.          So i've had this blog thing for awhile now. and i knew how to put pictures up awhile ago. but now i have no clue again. i also amaze myself with my own stupidity. i dont even know how to put a little picture thing up for my profile. maybe i shouldnt even be going to college!           i am so determined.               goodnight.          PS i tried a new font. i am cutting edge.
