Oh my gosh... I just realized I might see Harris there. Haha! That kid! Haven't seen him in ages! My aunt's friend's son! He's a freak. Haha... I call everyone a freak. Well, we used to hang out but lost contact so blah.   Listening to "Arms of an Angel" and "I Don't Wanna Know". So... deep. Meaningful. *sighzZ*
