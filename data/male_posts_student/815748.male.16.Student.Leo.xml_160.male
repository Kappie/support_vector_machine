In case you're wondering why I'm posting every day pretty much nowadays, it's because I've been bored lately and haven't had much to do that I like to do, and because posting is fun.  In case you have some beef about my doing so, keep in mind that Stephanie said that everyday posts were preferable, and that between Loren's blog and his Xanga he pretty much updates every day so I match him- except that blog posts are always more meaningful than Xanga ones.  So "Bon Voyage" was a good movie; it was no "Monsieur Ibrahim" but it was worth seeing.  I learned a new idiomatic expression; this one character was saying to another character "Qu'est-ce que te prends?" and they translated it as "What's wrong with you?"  Yeah, as that girl says (can I use that name?), "nerdy nerdy."  Speaking of which, I thought of another name for Stephanie: "that other girl," in that she's that girl's counterpart except that she doesn't like me/isn't good friends with me.  Also speaking of a different which, I was looking through my dictionary, and I came across the entry for "hypocrite," and guess whose picture I saw next to it?  Jason Sullivan's.  That's right, Jason Sullivan plays "Warcraft: 3."  Like oh me-an.  That is like the nerdiest thing anyone could do ever.  Like even nerds say that people who do that are nerds.  Dinner tonight at the Shens' was fun; Yin's parents and brother were also there.  We played "Super Smash Bros." and Chen (sp?) and Amy kept pulling a Pamela, i.e., laughing hysterically at unfunny things for extended periods of time.  People, come online...  While we were playing, the following quote arose (in the tradition of "What the?  He can kick me while I'm firing him?"), and that'll be it for today:   It's so annoying when you grab me while I'm bouncing! --- Jason Shen
