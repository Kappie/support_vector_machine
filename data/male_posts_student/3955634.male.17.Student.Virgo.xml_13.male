There are accusations and eyewitness accounts of an incident a few months back, before the handover of sovereignty in Iraq, that  urlLink Prime Minister Iyad Allawi personally executed six foreign insurgents  who were being held in a Baghdad prison. The Sydney Morning Herald's award-winning Paul McGeough has defended this controversial claim, and investigations have commenced.    Cheers to Holden overat urlLink Atrios for following the story as it continues to unfold. If this all turns out to be true, you can bet the US press will be circling likevultures--but for now apparently there will be no mention.    This ispreciselywhy blogging is such a phenomenon, ladies and gentlemen.
