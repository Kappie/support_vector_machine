Will you join up with the crowd? Or will you "do the family proud," Or will everyone be wowed?  Why does it always go that way? Hardly anyone has any say. And all seems to go astray. In this "brutal" world that exists today.  Where are we all going? What troubles are we towing? What problems are we showing? Is anyone all-knowing?  The way we walk The way we talk The way we think The way we are Is not the way we should be.  Another poem from the other site that I just got around to transferring.  Didn't revise this one... the original woohoo!
