I've confused myself already, (usually quite hard!) by tidying my room :-o yeah, weird. This guy came to look at our house today, my rents opened the door and were like "oh yes, this is the pit of the house, I would only go in if you dont value your life, it's inhabitant is currently in there, so watch out!" Thanx mum. You ever noticed how "cool" your parents are? No, didnt think so. It's strange, I've never seen the house so tidy, theres new pictures all over the walls and the hoover actually came out!! I'm moving near brackley from bicester, is that nearer to ayles*shitesville*bury??  Hasta Luego.  Jim x   All pictures copyright Jim 2004 so meh!
