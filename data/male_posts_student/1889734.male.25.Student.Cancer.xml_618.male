If Bush is re-elected, this ought to be a top priority.  Invade?  Maybe not immediately, but we should declare hostilities and start softening them up from the air.  So long as they think they can meddle and not be held accountable, they are going to continue.   Eventually, we'll probably have to go in there and clean this one up as well.  But I don't think people are ready for that just yet.  Syria and Iran by 2008.
