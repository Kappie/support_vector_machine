Finals is on evry1's minds but i dun get it realli much, i juss dun feel so scared bout da finals..i know i know most of the material dat has been taught thru da year so i guess i hav not dat much to wrry bout, besides math, geo's still quite confusin to me but i'll juss hafta deal, but evry1 shouldnt be worryin dat much, unless u havent been listenin or class or sumthin..tsk tsk..but study can do no harm but over doin it can, so mai advice is to dun over study to da wee hrs of da night it would juss screw u over, and get a lot of rest n eat a good breakfats....  okie one ding i'm kinda of worried..i'm scared if daniel member's to ask 4 contracts cuz i lost mine..*damn it*..i juss suck now it would b 5 for each letter in mai name M-I-C-H-A-E-L-L-I-U..10..dat means 50 pushes up..i can do it but ..damn it..at least he's not counting middle names *whew*..
