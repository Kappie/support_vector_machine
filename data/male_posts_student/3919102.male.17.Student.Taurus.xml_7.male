Ok, people, here it is.... me and Phylicia have known each other for a LONG time (since like January), and through this time, we have been really good freinds ever since. she had always been the girl i talk to, and tell my problems, cause usually no body listens to my problems and i just listen to other peoples problems. but with phylicia it was different, and we could actually talk to each other for real, it didnt feel like i had to be a certain type of person at all...probly cause i hadnt even ever seen her before... ever. so it wasnt even like i could like her like that, you kno?  well eventually i met simone and klarissa. we went bowling and stuff, and we had seen each other and stuff. it was like "ok, those are some pretty cool people."  so ISAAC and KLARISSA got together, this was RIGHT AFTER me and sophie broke up. so theyd go out on dates, and simone would HAVE TO come along too, so instead of it being three people, id go too as a friend of isaac and simone and klarissa, not as a boyfriedn to simone. then i started hearing that simone REALLY liked me (which now wasnt exactly true... so she realized). and i was like "thats cool, shes cute, shes nice, i just dont want a girlfriend." so i DID liek her, and i THOUGHT i really liked her, but i dont kno if i really did. it was as if people were forcing me to like her. all of her friends that i talked to would tell me how much she liked me, and how we should go out. but the thing was i ALWAYS felt like there was somthing preventing me from getting with ehr, and i kept saying that it was causei had just gotten out of a relationship... but its been FIVE FUCKING MONTHS! that cant be the reason.   so i realize now that it wasnt me, it was her. it was like i was telling meself that i liked her, but my heart wouldnt let me commit.... and in actuality, (i think, in my heart) i was looking for a reason to stop talknig to her... tho i didnt realize it consiously.  soooooo... gabe came ( rita calls him satan) along, and simone TOTALLY played my face... shes the only one that thinks im wrong in this... but its fine now, i dont have and feelings towards that now. but yeah, soooo.... me and simone fell apart cause i felt sort of betrayed, and really upset... and basically most people were like, ummm... forget her, ok? and id be like, "ok, ill try"  LIKE EVERYONE  so i did talk to her about it, and she just kept saying how wrong i was and stuff, and how everyon was wrong... not her. so it was whatever after that. and through this whole time, i was telling phylicia everything i felt, and she was always there for me. she tried to help and everything, but she didnt wanna get into it too much. so she was the one girl that i was able to talk to.. through everything.  so i started to realize that phylicia was the one that i really should have eben with in the first place... it was like these feelings that were  different  . they werent the same things i felt with simone OR sophie. it was this feeling of completness. so i realized that she was the one... not anybody else.  and so it wasnt like i had met her through simone or anything.. in fact, they became better friedns because of me. im the one who gave simone phylicia's screen name... so it wasnt like i met one of simones freinds, and then went behind her back and went out with her. it was like, they were two people i met differently, i didnt even knew they knew each other when i was talking to them at first. so yeah...  now me and phylicia go out... and its GREAT, i love her. its like all those feelings of... "i dont want another girlfriend" were gone. so we started dating a little while back... and im really happy... i do get to see her.. and i might be going to jordan next year too. hopefully drama wont continue there, but whatever.  soooo nowwwwwwwwwww people think that me and phylicia were a secret. WE WERENT. we were just waitng for simone to get home so that WE COULD TELL HER and not other people (ie Klarissa) it wasant that we didnt want her to know cause i think im in the wrong... STOP FUCKING ASSUMING THINGS PEOPLE! Simone should know not to assume better than ANYBODY! you were soooooooooooooooooooooo mad that i assumed and said i shouldnt, so dont do it yourself, just ask me like you wanted me to do...  anyway, there was no secret... I just wanted to tell people myself, but i guess that didnt work cause of isaacs dumb ass (lol) and some other people who talk too much... but its ok now, just dont be mad, theres nothing to be mad about.... im with phylicia... im not that important... so dont be mad... period.       sooo anyway... just know that there were no secrets... there was no "hidden relationship" at all... it was just that i didnt want people tryna tell my business when i can do it myself. so yeah... ill add more if there is more confusion       SO STOP BEING SO DAMN NOSEY!!!!!!!
