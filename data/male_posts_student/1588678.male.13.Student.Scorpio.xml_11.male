Durning school all the rap-guys try to teach me the lingo. Knowing me, I suck at it. Even thou I'm into rock 'n roll, I try, damn hard!   Okay, it seems that maybe rock 'n roll should have it's own language, or R, and even techno! Wouldn't that be cool? Well, I'll try coming up with a rock 'n roll or techno language. Later dawg!
