I guess it's because I've gotten myself into way too much of a night-owl schedule again.  Graduation!  I graduate soon!  I'm pretty damn excited about that.  "Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of 99.. wear sunscreen."    I think I will go to a tanning bed instead, but thanks Baz Luhrman.  I seriously have no idea why I bother typing this right now.  If I had a reader or two, by chance, they have surely given up on the hope that I was even alive anymore after the nearly MONTH absence.  I've just been busy.  Too many people to do and too many things to see.. er, something vice-versa.  If I could kill two people, I think I would kill the two bastards on the Sonic commercials.  They irritate me.  Don't drive up to the drive-through of other restaurants and tell them how Sonic does things differently.  Just drive to fucking Sonic if you want Sonic Texas-Toast and Breakfast Burritos you cunts.  Wouldn't that be sad if I could wish two people dead, and the people I wished it upon were actors in a commercial that mildly annoys me for the 30 seconds that it airs?  I couldn't really wish that on anyone anyway, but you'd hope I would use my power to rid the world of some evil dictator not some douche-bag 32 year old Sonic commercial guys.  For those of you who don't know or don't live in this part of the country (hell), Sonic is a drive-in fast food chain.  At this point I'm convinced that the only patrons of my weblog will be people who accidental stumble in, because anyone who once read this shit has since passed by to more interesting (and updated regularly) things.  I just referenced this part of the country as hell, but that's a lie.  I'm gonna miss so many things about this place when I move soon.  I'll miss my bank with its 8am - 8pm lobby hours.  I'm going to miss... yeah, I'll miss my bank.  I'll miss other stuff too, but I'm tired and can't think of them.    Sleepy-time.
