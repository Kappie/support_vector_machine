I'm the only entity keeping him from dying at everything he does. Not to mention he's too suicidal. Although in this one I have to thank that twin sister of his. She keeps him in check at everything he does, and she won't let him commit suicide. To think she'd cry at the mere thought of him dying. This is getting very complicated. If I keep her out of the way, this guy just might kill himself before he lets me out, and I can't let that happen. But, if I keep her with him, I won't get many chances at getting out, although his health is guaranteed. Hmm... Very doubtful indeed. Not to mention this new girl, another "sister" of his. This is getting very complicated indeed. Although I can count on the new guy in this case, if he can get both girls away enough from my other self, my other self would get really depressed, and he just might let me out to ease his feelings. I can understand this guy, actually, to think you've been hiding your true feelings for a very long time from everybody, out of fear. He needs my power, I know it, but he doesn't want to be given the power at all. Is this what people call humanity? That humans do the most stupid things just because it's already part of their personality? Or is it because of these two girls in his life?   Before all else, I have to tell his twin sister this: Even though I don't like you much, I don't hate you. I also appreciate what you're doing for this guy, even though he may be too much of a wimp. Actually, miss, he won't tell you this in person, so I have to tell you instead: he needs you in his life. He can't live for long knowing he broke a promise with you, especially if it's about an arranged meeting. I just have a suggestion for you, if ever he needs to bring out his feelings, don't stop him. It'll only hurt him more. Trust me on this, I know what happened, since he nearly killed that classmate of his when someone tried didn't try to stop him. So you really have to pick, hurt this guy, or let him take all his anger out on some poor, unfortunate soul that he's going to sacrifice to me. And in this one, there are no middle options, well, except that you start crying in front of him, which'll make him snap back into consciousness, but he'll get really vulnerable. So you actually have three options, stop him forcefully (I don't see how you can do that), make him stop by crying (A not so bad, but not really good option), or let him kill his enemy (The best option so far since he gets stronger as he taps more and more into my power). In the end, when he kills enough, his spirit will die, and mine will control his body, and I'm preparing you who are so important to him for that. There will come a time when I will take control of this body, like now, while I'm typing this true statement up, but that time will be when he no longer has control over his killing instinct. I hope you haven't noticed yet, but he's getting there. Finally! After fifteen long years I get to live completely free! And that period will be marked by the death of his father. The moment his father dies, I take control. It's a good thing I'm implanting all these thoughts of hate in his mind.   It's even better if he kills his own father over someone, say, his twin sister? Ironic, isn't? You destroy your own flesh and blood for someone who's not even related to you, just because the person's your "soul mate." Beautiful the way love works. I benefit a lot out of this love. Just because I made my guy think that he's not loved by anyone, not even his precious sister. Ahh... I'm going to love working this body out. Not to mention the guy has knives in his closet, sharpened fully. It's a good thing he's getting into karate, then maybe I'll persuade him into ninjutsu, and, hmm... Maybe koppo as well. Please don't misunderstand this, I am not evil. I'm just sarcastically taking pleasure in the pain of others. Especially the pain of my guy. The more pain he feels, the more pleasure I get. It's actually a good thing his twin sisiter came into his life, at least he wouldn't just go get himself killed, just because he doesn't want her to cry for him. Really funny the way my sister's mind works, right? She gets a guy to like a girl, sure, not the normal infatuation situation she often sets my guy up on, gets it to the point that he treats her as more important than himself, and as such, with my other sister's help, convinces him not to commit suicide. Then, we make him believe that the love is one sided, until he gets really depressed. When he's depressed, sure, he'll think about suicide, but then he'll think about this twin of his, and stops. So what's his other alternative? He needs to kill someone, but he can't kill himself, he won't kill his twin sister, and he doesn't like his dad much. It's basically a hundred percent sure win for me, although that twin sister of his just has to prove to him that she really loves him as well, and this plan goes bye-bye, then I'll have to wait for another opportunity. What do you guys think?  (Shi wa Tenshi in sarcastic mood)
