Need directions call or something. pretty much take 96W till you get to the Novi/Walled Lake exit...its somewhere around there....  I can't take any people cause I get off work at 8 and I need to shower and then I am leaving, but it will be ok cause they dont hit the stage till 9 or so.  It's not far away so if you got nothing better to do, you should go!
