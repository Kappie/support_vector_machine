I can't tell you why; I mean, I guess I could, but some parts are indescribable.   From up here the city lights  burn  Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  Of our dying day Of our dying day Of our dying  For a second I wish the  tide  Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight   The way that provoke the sights of fire, and then the thought of water. I don't know if it was on purpose, but it's really good. I think there's actually a name for word placement like this: juxtaposition.   jux路ta路po路si路tion ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (jkst-p-zshn) n.  The act or an instance of juxtaposing or the state of being juxtaposed.   Who the fuck knows ;\.   Lately, I've been working on blog icons for my blog webring (Scroll down and pay attention to the right). I'll wait for ya.  Back yet? They're pretty aren't they? They're in no particular order other than the earliest made to the latest made. Most of them are made with the same filters and stuff; mostly fades.   Katie's  - Katie's link is made of five layers. A pastelish rainbow background takes over the whole first layer, while a huge faded muffin takes over the second layer. The third, fourth, and fifth layers come from an inside joke with Katie: the infamous talking muffin. Layer three is actually two muffins side by side. Layer three is a speech ballon, and layer five is the title of Katie's blog.   Mine  - I wasn't sure how to display someone being unsensitive, but I decided I would base it off an older avatar of mine. Bowser's face is distorted in the background by an ocean wave, and two goombas face forward. Originally the princess was in the middle to add to the whole unsensitive theme, but I took her out. I guess if you really want an explanation for that other than it didn't look good, you can use the irony of 'mrunsensitive' because I am very sensitive ;\.   Brittney's*  - Brittney's link is made of three layers. The first layer is actually her picture from her blog, but it's distorted: I wrapped the whole picture into a circle. When I first went looking for a background for her link I decided on red because of her hair ;\. Interesting. Hmm, the second layer is one of my favorite text affects, but Brittney's text ahs a wave to symbolize the beach and florida. The third layer is a phrase on her blog which I really like.    Bobby's*  - Bobby's link is the least artistic. It's very simple, but very nice looking. I like the ways the colors contrast on each other, and I also like the way that the colors are in fact cherry colors. Three cherries can be seen behind Bobby's name.   Becca's  - Becca's is very interesting because of the fact that there are so many things going on; the most apparent is her blog's title. This picture is made up of three layers and a background. One layer is pink cake, one layer is the flag of Great Britain, and the third is massive text (for her massive personality?). I wanted to add a lot more to Becca's because Becca has so much going on, but I thought that there were already too many things going on.   Erin's  - Erin's picture is one of the best I think. As nice as it looks, Erin's took the least time because the pictures I wanted were very easy to find. The background is a picture of the beast, he shows through Belle and also through the text. I thought it was a very interesting effect to have Belle overlapping the beast's face. What really pulls the picture together is the Walt Disney font though. Nice, eh? It uses the same text affect as Brittney. I'm going to be said when I have to delete it though. I'm going to have to if Erin continues not updating.   Kristin's  - Kristin's picture is very simple, but I like it like that. Her's took the most time because I kept trying to add more, and then taking other stuff off. I decided to make the background very light, to bring out the line "You bring out the bad in me." Not too clever, but eh =\. I really like Kristin's background. It's made up of pinks, blues, and greens, and I like the effect of the sad face in the middle of all of the colors. Yes, those are dance shoes on the bottom right. I figured her icon wouldn't be complete without something to do with dance.   Bri's  - Bri's icon is very interesting because I had nothing to work with. What the heck is 'boho'?. Anyways, I decided to use something I was thinking for Brittney: huge text. The nice thing was that Bri's title could be cut into 'wondergirl' and most people would think that was her title unless they really looked at it. It parallels Bri, she's a lot more than meets the eye. You really have to get to know her before you think you know her. Did that make sense? 'bohowondergirl' uses the same text affect that Brittney's and Erin's use, but there's more of that white border. In the background is a tree. Why a tree? Well, I looked up boho online and I saw something that said 'boho/earthy girls.' So maybe boho has to do with the earth. There's also a question mark faded into the middle of the icon.   I put a lot of thought into these. Ok, if you have a "*" by your name then it basically means that I may change your icon one of these days, if I get time. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF YOUR ICON!  I had other stuff to talk about, but I forg...  Oh yeah! Meh FL friends started school today! They were all looking forward to it, but they only had 'OK' days. Poor guys. I   Then there's "Red Crystal" another story I'm writing. I just realized both of my works have 'red' in their titles. Anyways, it's about this kingdom of humans who has been waring with a kingdom of sorcerers/esses for years, and the oldest son of the family begins to get nightmares and cast spells in his sleep. He searches out a crystal that if broken should stop his nightly occurences. He's afraid he won't be crowned king if someone finds out, and when he breaks it something happens that he never dreamed happens.  And finally, Megaman X7, which totally rocks was played by me today. Thanks Terrance!  Holy crap! A talking muffin!
