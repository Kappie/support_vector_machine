The research was interesting and fun, but library research for any extended length of time gives me a headache... I went home for lunch, took a nap, and then went to work. It's cool at work, we went back to the making sandwiches thing. It saves money, is healthy, and gives us an excuse to take a massive long break so that rules.  Just did some more research... I'm assuming that there's a massive difference between "motion picture" and "videorecording." I'm going to have to talk to a librarian about that. I hope it doesn't mean I've got to watch a movie via projector? I don't want to drive all the way to UCLA for something I can't use!  The song of the moment is "Walk Among Us" by the  Misfits  from their  Walk Among Us  CD (1982).  ***
