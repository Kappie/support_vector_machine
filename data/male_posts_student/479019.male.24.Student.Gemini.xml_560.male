It also had some interesting booths and interesting people. Anyway... the Muffs weren't that great, or perhaps it was 'cause their audio equipment sucked ass? The Circle Jerks were awesome. The crowd was lively and Keith Morris was fun. We also saw Greg Hetson walking around the fair earlier.  It was cool hanging out with Brandon, PM, Heather, and PM's friend. Tomorrow it should be interesting. Lots of people I know will be there tomorrow, including PM, Esther, Steff, Abby, and a bunch of boardies.   Today was a good day.  ***
