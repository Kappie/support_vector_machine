So while working on a project is admirable, it's no more important in the schema.    Listening to pop-grunge like Nickelback and Trapt, specifically because it is in iambic pentameter.  Students think cadence to writing is dead.  What better than white guys singing about cliche feelings to prove my point?    They didn't take well to Franz Ferdinand.  Or Johnny Cash.  Maybe some Rob Zombie?    Went to Exchange Club with Bill, my grandma's husband who I guess is my grandfather now, but it's odd, because it is removed bunches.  Anyway, got introduced, shook a lot of hands, had that benevolent smile up the whole time.  Good folks.  Went shopping for some swank black kicking/dress shoes, but opportunity cost wasn't high enough.  So I bought a few shirts at PacSun.    STORY - Never in my life have I enjoyed righteous game with a girl at a store in the town of dwelling.  But when I'm on vacation, it's mad money.  Today, a sexy crop cut blonde wearing the wifebeater, nose rock, red highlights rings me up.  We get to talking, everything's cool, except my 85 year old 4'11" grandmother is there, trying to peek up over the counter to look, and it's obvious she doesn't agree with my muse's fashion choices, specifically the high seriousness with which bra strap played into the wardrobe.  But I don't care, and in fact it's quite the turn-on.  She laughs at some things I throw out in passing, and it's kind of a nervous energy, something I rarely get in the hippie cities, where immersion is complete (I've realized that I'm an Arkansas hippie; I think one way, but my foibles cast me a different way, leaving me in constant awe of those who are given completely to the free love/free weed cause).  She graduated Fayetteville High three, four years ago, and is in school, though I don't know what...he friend is in photojournalism though, found out after discussing my want to buy a swank camcorder.    But what can exist?  She rings me up, wishes me luck, I thank her, and I walk off.  Look back.  She's looking.  All I need to do is go back into the store, and throw the glory line out   I know this is forward, but I'd like to take you out for dinner if you're free tonight.  Nothing serious, I'm leaving town in a day...just something to do.   But the line is bullshit, and no matter how I try to dress it, it still sounds like schmuck trying to get laid in a one'er.  I leave.  Walk a ways, wishing I had left something in the store so I could go back.  And I had left something!  My shoes!  From earlier, the sandals I picked up.  I had to hang them on something to try on a necklace.  They are still there!  She is still there!  No more being a pussy!   I walk back, energy in my step.  Grandma waits outside.    And right in front of me is a slow moving curly haired dicktard, loafing at a pace great for stoners but terrible for anxious guys trying to weave with girls.  I pass him in a bout of awkwardness, getting the attention of the girl.    In my mind, I go over the line again.  It's not that bad.    Yeah, it really is.    I pick up my bag.   Wow!  I hadn't seen that!  she says, obviously hoping I will step ten paces closer and ask for the number, unaware of my indecisiveness and lack of sufficient address in town.  I smile big at her and turn around.  It's still on my mind.
