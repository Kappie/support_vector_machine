But, even still, I enjoy the idea of what occupation I  should  do. I've narrowed them down to these three finalists: librarian, bartender, and missionary. I can't express the euphoria created by when I found book in the Graduate Library. It wasn't like sex (or at least how people describe sex). It was a silent filling of oneself with joy and purpose. I got the same feeling when I looked through my Dad's book:  The Little Black Book of Bartending . While I kindof enjoy cooking, I think the reason I like it is because it's in the mental proximity of mixing drinks. The mear notion of filling glasses with measured or, with experience, umeasured amounts of juices and alcohols...it fills me. Mission work does not do this, at least not yet. It is more of a cerebral pleasure than an emotional one. I like the idea of spreading the Word as it provides me with real purpose. Truly, what grand final purpose is fulfilled by making a damn fine Manhattan, or finding some obsure French version of "Lesbian Nuns: the Sequel"?  The idea of bartending comes up today from my recent chapter of  The Modern Gentleman . Really, this book covers everything: sex to fornicate, drugs to ingest, clothing to wear, literature to read, movies to see, and, of course, drinks to mix. It's inspiring if somewhat unreachable by me. My personality and moral strictures prevent me from performing some..."actions"...mention within.
