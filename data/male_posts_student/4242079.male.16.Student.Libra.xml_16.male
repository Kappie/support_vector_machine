We can no longer afford our lifestyle, so we're going to have to rid ourselves of you. Bah Humbug. I need a job, or for you all to purchase my belongings. Comment for info.   I read from a notebook,  through a phone to who I love.  It was the most honest thing,  I've ever written or dreamed of.   and now i wait for her reaction. i don't want to hurt her.    urlLink  postCount('laidoff');
