I've been using it to host my Oddworld news blog for some time now, as uJournal was insufficient for what I wanted to do with that. However, uJournal continued to suit me for my Quotidienne... Until now. Not that I'm upset with the people behind uJournal. They've offered a fantastic service for me over the months... in fact, over the years.  I won't bother uploading anything from my uJournal to here, as I painstakingly did with OddBlog. For one thing, my last few updates probably won't have survived, though I'm confident the most of them will have. Now... I have about a week's worth of events to detail to you.  :-p  Tuesday was, of course, the day I went into the city to meet Jonny. That didn't go as well as planned. I had planned to take Jonny to a cafe or something afterwards, buy him a drink, and have a really good chat with him, which I'd actually come up with quite spontaneously with Nathan the night before, after ages of agonising over it. However, as it happened, Jonny had to leave by 4, and even then overstayed by 20 minutes because of all the trailers and adverts they show. King Arthur was a good film, though. I was amused when Jonny leant over to me and pointed out that "there are no mountains there." Funny, I always though the area north of Hadrian's Wall was somewhat mountainous, it being Scotland and all. I was also amused by Swordy's random showing up. He just plonked himself next to me, much to Jonny's delight and my exasperation. He asked me if he should leave, but I told him not to. I couldn't tell Jonny anyway.  I now believe I'm actually over him.  Thursday saw me in the city with Nick. We met up in Ster and went and saw The Stepford Wives, which was much better than I expected. In fact, I most enjoyed it. Afterwards, Nick and I enjoyed a stroll and a chat before we headed back towards Nando's and lunch. I was a bit disappointed by not getting a tub of their great mayonnaise as I did last time I was there with Ed (I detest most mayonnaise, but Nando's is brilliant and I love it), and also they had changed the menus to get rid most of the fun, lively remarks such as "Enjoy passionate debates," and so on. Afterwards, Nick didn't have much time til' his bus arrived, so we walked over to the Castle Gardens, with me complaining about all the muffies that would be there. I told Nick to guess. Finally I told him, bwahaha.  I spent much of Saturday working, which threw Ed's and my plan to meet up sometime before he left on holiday into a somewhat last minute caper. Ed was meeting with someone he has, ahem, taken a liking to on either Sunday or Monday, though this was conveniently cemented to Monday, meaning I could enjoy Sunday afternoon with Ed. As it happened, 'enjoy' was a somewhat laughable term. We met, Ed being much impressed by my new look (so he tells me, at least :-p), and went upstairs to chat to Al and persuade him to give us free tickets. After that, we ate at Nando's (of all places!) where our chicken breast burgers were decorated with Fast-Food-style plastic cheese, which fortunately was alright. 20 minutes later, and we walked out of what I can safely say is the shittiest film I have ever seen. Don't see Thunderbirds. It's shit - and I enjoyed Lost In Space, so take heed of my words. The Thunderizer... Uck. The last straw was "Time to Thunderize."  Tragically, since Ed was now free, it meant he had to take his sister swimming, so once again my outing with someone was cut short (gee, three in a row, what a fab week). We quickly ran off to Nando's because I'd left my sunglasses there (clever!), then were much amused by there being no bus for Ed to get home on, on a Sunday. Although there was really, it was just not going to the nearest stop, so I did really have to be abandoned again. Still, we had a great chat in the intervening half an hour, and I finally realised that Norwich is dull and there is remarkably little to actually do.  I guess I can breeze over the last couple of days, as all they have involved is personal downstairs problems and me teasing Peter over the webcam. Dad has gone to London, so while Mum is at work, I'm free to clothe myself however - or however much - I want.  ;-)  On Monday I did phone Ed in the evening to ask how things had gone that day for him, but he was busy at the time, and said he'd phone me the next evening, which went without call. I got home from Granddad's this evening, and made sure to do a 1471 - only for Ed's number to be read out. Hahaha, what bad luck. I speculate that Nathan is a good friend and told Ed how *devestated* I was that he didn't call me back. And now Ed's on holiday, tsk.  Still, Meyer has just this very evening invited me to his birthday city adventures. Current plans, as far as I am aware, involve eating at Pizza Express and seeing The Bourne Supremacy (and not Aliens Vs. Predator, because despite Will's claim, that doesn't come out here for another two-and-a-half months, hahaha). Nathan is even coming, and I've been trying to drag him outside all holidays. I guess he'll only comply to the posse spirit. *sigh*  Well, here's to tomorrow, and all the nothingness it will bring.
