I live in a little apartment with two chambers in the south of Berlin (Friedenau), it's very nice with two balconys but thanks to my lazyness it's a mess. In my spare time I play the piano and take photos. I spend much of my time at  urlLink this restaurant , helping a bit and entertaining (annoying) the guests with my piano-music.  PS: I try to write in English for the international readers. Yet I don't feel comfortable with that.
