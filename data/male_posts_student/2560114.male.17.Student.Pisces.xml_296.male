Well it all started like this, Matt, Scott, Keelee, and Chris went to my house to pick me up...i thought we were goin to jeff's house and chill, but i was wrong. We ended up goin to kelley's house cuz it was the only place we could drink...i didnt want to drink too much cuz i was goin to 6 flags in the mornin...but i got totally wasted...matt told me that i drank 18 shots of tequila and beers and such...i couldnt even fuckin remember what i did...i found out that i was goin crazy and i freakin pissed all over myself and threw up on myself aswell...becuz of this my mom and dad were hella worried, they stayed up the whole nite cuz they thought i was missing or even kidnapped...im am totally sorry for what i did yesterday...it was an act that i will never do again...jus wakin up the next day after this is torture...my mom took away my cell and i think she is cancelling my service...im probly gonna get more shit when my dad gets home...God im such an idiot...i should of used my head and jus walked away from this whole ordeal...but i jus gave in...the next time im in this situation, im gonna stand up for myself and jus walk away from it...i am so sorry...payce...
