'' i haven't studied a single thing.. im sooo dead..'' well let me pain ur ears again as i repeat it over and over again. admittedly.. i loved my holidays and all the outings and trip over the causeway and especially the fun times in bannd. however it pains me as well to decide now that i am truly and finally.. dead. not only have the terms been creeping up slowly and carefully.. i have done nothing to ensure i do not get beheaded by it.. even now here i am gleefully writing about how im gonna die tml for my 1st exam. yikes.  Maybe i could, as before recount happy things that happened this holiday.  1)band concert- heckuva fun experience playing a 'foreign' instrument and making my section nervous as they watch me blow the place to bits. 2)trip to m'sia.. sadly missed the band chalet but spent time with relatives who came from the u.s and boy was the food good! =) 3)uncontrollable eating + NO PE!! - man am i dead when i get to thursdays on the track. 4)meeting up with sec school friends over the course of holiday and pwing them - only in mind however - in all forms of entertainment including pool. 5)laming YOUR ass off in blogs like these =) It is kinda sad isnt it then that this is probably the first blog in which i feel kinda down.. p.s if ur reading this over a course of a week after its published.. ur screwed for terms too =) kidding.. but i HAVE to make myself feel better dont i? i think the number of smiley faces has been decreasing as school reopening draws ever nearer.. well i better end off with a happy thought, lest thou shalt find thy mind filled with endless sorrow and LUNACY.  6) SWITZERLAND TRIP! ALRIGHT! 1st band trip ever overseas.. boy am i excited.. all i can hope for really is that the a) plane dont crash b) i dont fall sick and c)we do well in the competition over there! well for those who are wondering at the sanity of doing this on the eve of apocalypse, wonder no more. there is entirely no special reason why im killing myself writing this instead of studying other than the fact that i realise im gonna play cs again. now. make any sense to u? not to me either. =D (= *screwed*
