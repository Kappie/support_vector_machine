In 16 hours, I will be on a school bus with a bunch of other hooligans (cough:: Pohlman ::cough) on our way to O'Hare airport to catch a plane to London, England to catch a plane to Rome, Italy to catch a bus to San Benedetto del Tronto, Italy.  After the plane rides, layovers, and bus rides, I will be one tired American.  It all starts around 15:30.  That's 3:30 PM if you don't speak European.  Everyone who is going meets up in the Bloom parking lot to put their luggage and stuff on a van and board a bus that is going to O'Hare airport.  Once we get to O'Hare, we get our stuff and board the 20:20 plane.  That is 8:20 PM if you don't speak European.  I will arrive in London, England at 10:20 local time (that is a 7 hour plane ride) and board the 14:05 plane to Rome, Italy. (7:05 local time)  That is 2:05 PM if you don't speak European.  I will arrive in Rome at 17:30. (10:30 AM local time)  That is 5:30 PM if you don't speak European.  After I arrive in Rome, I will get on another school bus with everyone else and ride to San Benedetto del Tronto, meet up with the Quevedos, the family I will stay with for the next two weeks, and go home.  All that is today.  Yesterday, I got everything all packed up.  Clothes, gifts, reading material, snacks, music, shoes, everything.  It's all packed up and ready to go.  I am so excited I can't even type.  I was out all day yesterday looking for a Chicago Fire t-shirt and I came across a very troubling problem: NO STORES CARRY CHICAGO FIRE MERCHANDISE!!!!  Damn you all!!!  I could go on a huge rant, but I have a lot more to post and I need to get to bed soon.  As for Friday night's late night soccer?  Tremendous fun.  I had such a great time.  We played on a dimly lit tennis court.  We used one side of the court and set up two mini goals on either end.  Towards the end, lightning started to light the sky.  We played a bunch of 3 v. 3 games with one substitute.  I played moderately well considering my hip flexor was messed up pretty badly.  I got a goal, and a few good passes, and dug hard to win the ball and fight off a defender.  I also got kicked in the face.  Ahhhhh, the beautiful game.  How I love it.  I hope we do late night soccer again.  My Fire lost 3-2 to the Los Angeles Galaxy on Saturday afternoon.  It was good to see Ante Razov get back on the goal scoring track again.  He even scored a penalty kick on the same goal that Pat Onstad saved his penalty kick in MLS Cup 2003.  Ante is back, however, we do miss Armas and Beasley and Ralph and Williams so very desperately.  Let's hope Armas and Beasley make us proud and beat the living feces out of Grenada today.  You gotta love this:  today's strategy for the United States World Cup Qualifying match against Grenada?  "Go out there and annihilate them." and "Score as many goals as you can."  This should be fun.  Well, off to bed I go.  The next time you hear from me, I will be in beautiful Italy.  Ciao amici.
