Well, you may as well not go to the links I put, as it is not there anymore. Looks like the account was frozen. Just like mine really... BIGGUS DICKUS ISN'T EVEN RUDE!!! The good point is that the music isn't there, and so no-one else will have to be subjected to its tortures.  I watched Star Wars IV - A New Hope on video this morning, being bored as I was, and not wanting to do revision. A rather good film, even it is blindingly obvious that a Storm Trooper smashes his head on a low door... Also watched Jurassic Park earlier this evening, which was also rather good.   Finally, I managed to get about half an hours revision in today, which was basically just reading through old geography exercise books. Personally, I don't really see how the eruption of Mount St Helens will ever affect me, but meh, that's geography for you. At least it's not drama. I mean, at least geography may come in a little useful, but drama! What a waste of time... you'd have to be a real fool to do that as a subject. It's just like... THROWING your life away ...         ...........          .............            .......... DICKYBOD!!!!   Reading:  A Brief History of Time, quite confusing  Listening to:  Burley Brawl  Watching:  Star Wars, Jurassic Park  Confused about:  I actually understand most of the geography stuff  Annoyed with:  neopets  Mood:  not too bad at the moment
