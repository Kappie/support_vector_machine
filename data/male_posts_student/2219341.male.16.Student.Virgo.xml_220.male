BUT I WANT TO SCREAM IT ALL OUT!  i hate having stuff locked up inside me... but it helps when you know how to let that stuff out in an appropriate way.  knowing me i'd probably just get everything off my chest and then realize that i didnt wanna say all of it.  speaking of my chest!  i've been havin some chest pain lately.  but what else is new.  it actually did go away for a long time.  but then i guess i let its slowly creep back.  its rather annoying but at least i havent started having panic attacks and anxiety attacks again so im not gonna complain.  anyways.  i think im just gonna post and then go wallow.  goodnight.
