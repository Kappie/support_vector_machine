First things first, never miss an oppurtunity because you think you may have another one.   The second one is more personal.  I see why it's easier to be friends with girls, and it's not that I'm gay.  I've come to see, that usually guys will inspire each other to act more 'guyish' or 'manish' (I just realized I use 'guy' because 'man' carries alot more weight) while girls of course don't make this happen.  If I was around a lot of girls who were smoking, no desire to smoke even if they were best friends, now if my best guy friends (or any guys I was friendly with) were smoking, you better believe I'd be lighting up! I felt this at lunch today, if I saw a person who liked nice (bangin'?) I'd normally just divert my eyes.  Not at lunch, at lunch it's more of a stare, followed by a coughing, choking (on juice) or screaming (because I scream alot).    On the matter of girls, it's funny the assumptions about race'joe-average-middle-class-black-guy' thinks.  For example, I brought up at lunch, 'aren't black girls assumed to just like black guys more?' Not too irrational, since most black guys are likely married to black girls.  But at the same time, you could point around the table and say "He likes white girls" or "He likes Spanish girls" or "He only likes black girls" It's sort of that double standard thing black people have going on, interesting, right?
