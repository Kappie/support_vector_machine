But anyway, back to the point of this blog.  I sat down with my food, eating a spicy chicken burger (the only think I could bring myself to eat). I was there for only a couple minutes when a rather aged, old lady sat down at the table next to me, in the process she pushed a napkin on the floor then said “I’ll just push it on the floor like everyone else” then commenced laughing.  I don’t know why, what she said wasn’t all that funny, after all what’s so great about littering and making someone else pick it up?  I thought that this was the end of my conversation with the creepy old lady. But no she continued the conversation from there, and this is sort of how it went…  Old lady- “so do you like the burgers here?” Me- “I guess” takes a bite Old lady- “I like the burgers here, the best burgers in town they are.” Me- “yup.” Drinks pop Old lady- “I know some people that don’t like the burgers here, so when they say that, I tell them that I’ve had their burgers and they aren’t that good” Me- Smirks, then eats some fries, realizes they’re gross so I put them down Old lady- “yes I tell them what I think, I don’t care how they react…”  Fortunately at this point in time one of the old lady’s friends came by and they promptly forgot about me.  But in conclusion I think that all old people should be locked away, for their own safety as much as our own.  Except for my grandma, because she’s to nice for the world to be deprived of her. -Matt
