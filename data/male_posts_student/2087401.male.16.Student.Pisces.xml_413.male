Sorry for excessive posting, I just discovered this now and not at 6:54:26 PM when "You know something there, General Cho? If you had a story, you'd write it. If you don't have one, shut up." went up.  Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?
