A  Windows  user myself, I've been tracking Apple's stuff ever since I got my iPod a couple of years ago. That little music player awakened me to the whole world of  Mac , a world with a new attitude and style.       The iPod originally came with some software called  MusicMatch , which was confusing, complicated and counter-intuitive. I didn't like it at all, but it worked; a necessary evil if you will.  Then along came a PC port of Apple's  iTunes  and it changed everything, making just about everything you could think of incredibly easy. It syncs your iPod automatically, collates and organises files, sets up playlists and so much more. Other programs like  Windows Media Player  and  Real Player  don't stand a chance.       Now what if all your programs could be like  iTunes ? What if you could rid yourself of all the  Musicmatch es and live an easier life? I think that's what  Mac  offers and what  Windows  doesn't.  Apple's  OS X  is cool enough as it is, but the new stuff they're putting in it is breathtaking. I could go on all night about all the awesome stuff in, but let's just say it's like iTunes a thousand times over. Couple this with some gorgeous, innovative hardware and you've got the computer system of your dreams. The only problem is the price.       Well, that's not strictly true. If I wanted to switch to  Mac , I'd have to almost give up PC gaming and that could be a problem. Yet we have consoles to game on and to be honest, I wouldn't miss it that much. The real barrier is money though. Getting a PowerMac with a deent set of software would set me back Â£2000. Yeah, ouch.  I'm saving up for my gap year right now, so upgrading even my own  Windows  PC is out of the question. My machine will have to do me until Autumn 2005, then I'll be way for a year. When I come back in Autumn 2006 though, I'll need a new computer for university, most likely a laptop. I'll have some money then and I'll have to choose between operating systems, and what a choice.       Apple is such a tempting proposition and one that I might just fall for sometime. Meanwhile, it's back to a world full of too many  MusiMatch es and not enough  iTunes .
