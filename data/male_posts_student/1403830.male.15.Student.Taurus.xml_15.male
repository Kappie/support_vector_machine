Fuck, I could leave lakeside this summer and never look back.  I could  never see people from there again.  And not to say that I don't like you, I have friends there.  But I just don't love you enough to not leave you.  Same with my family; sure I'd be depressed for a while, but I wouldn't  fight it.  And maybe that's my problem.  By not being attached so strongly to anything, I'm really just nothing,  nothing really defines me.  We are what we know and what we do.  And we usually know what we do, and do what we know.  But what happens if your knowledge is scattered throughout a whole bunch  of different things?  There's no job opening that says multiple choice  on the nameplate.  And if there's one thing I've noticed, I'm sick of fucking noticing.  I'm sick of this pusedo-hippie bullshit that makes me have to be fucking  in touch with my feelings.  And I hate how I follow it.  I hate how thinking blows things out of proportions.  Just because she laughs doesn't mean she wants to suck your dick.  And I'm done with all of you.  I'm sick of your attitudes.  I'm done with the unappreciative bullshit.  I don't know where I'll go, but it sure as hell aint here.  I wanna go somewhere where the brunettes wear green and pink and the  blondes have deep voices and shallow eyes, and where her frivolous  smile  Is only one  Disguise  muscle said chalk it up to achohol  Maybe I will ryan, maybe I will.
