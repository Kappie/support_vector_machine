Whats that Charlie Brown?...No you cannot "sex" the aubergine...Well for one thing it would get stuck, and for another...EUW NO!  Back to business.    David. David David David David David. We spent this afternoon together, as you do, em...*conversing* in each of the places mentioned in my previous post. It's none of your business what we got up to, so don't ask me to tell you.  All i can say is i'm still very happy. There was a definite bit of "kinky" in his behaviour today, so he seemed to be feeling adventurous. Was fun, and a good laugh. We somehow managed to still get interupted by stomach's growling, mobile fones going off at inappropriate moments and his hair getting in the way (which i dont care about anymore). I think he might be trying to make me slow down a bit, because i am getting rather attatched to the boy, and i dunno if he's at the same place i am. "I really really like you." got met with "I like you too."  I'm not bothered if he's not clicking with me as much as i am with him. I mean, obviously its a massive disappointment, but its not like i expected goodness forever with him. We started going out without knowing much about each other, and even with my dodgy looks my personality is hardly winning me Miss Congeniality 2004.  And my God i need to get over this paranoia! Obviously he likes me, coz he aint ditched me yet and he did say yes to me in the first place when i asked him out. DUH! Andrew totally get over yourself. There it's done. Im over myself. He likes me. YAY! Please disregard the above rant about myself being not nice. I am nice. :D Arent i?  Anywayz, its not just *activities* that we enjoy with each other. We were on the fone from before midnight till after 5am the other night talking about so much. Ex-boyfriends of mine and the effects afterwards, our family situations, his CD collection, his favourite food (heehee...now thats between the two of us), his addiction to milk, our childhoods, our friendships and how long they've lasted...tons and tons more stuff. It was positively brilliant. Actually the first foneconvo ive had in ages where it hasnt been interrupted by something else, and the first one in ages that i didnt want to end.  Duuuuuuuude.
