I woke up to watch the last episode of the Jap show! The ending so stupid. Sigh. It gave me a lot of qi shi. Yes!  Anyhoo, today's a long and stupid day. In GP, we formed new groups. Bascially, SU were disbanded and spilt up and there were some changes. Me and CQ left the girls' team to join Kelvin's team. Yeah. That terrible-patriot-to-a-fault MCP gave a typically patriotic name to his group. Pionner Action Party. Everyone groaned (inwardsly or outwardsly) at that  lame  name. Even we ended up as the opposition for the upcoming date over "Censorship is a nesscarry evil". O.O  Okay. After GP was Chem. Before that, let me narrate what deal was made. CQ is to treat me ILT if I fail Chem. Well, you can pretty much guess the results of the bet by looking at the title. I got to treat him ILT, because I passed!! I always sucks at betting. Heh HEh. My Section A saved me, for I scored 21.5/30. Yep.   Okay. We changed our Mass PE teacher. Now we are no longer stuck with Mr Gerald Boh. We got Kevin Ang. O.O He's not bad la. We got let off early. Heh.   Right. Okay. Lotsa lotsa things happened. I am not really in the position to narrate, so I won't. Meow moo!   Oh yes. Me and XC started talking le! I am so happy. I was being childish. Really. I have to thank WQ for that. He started the ball rolling. I guess people like us needs people like WQ around more often. HAHAHA! Now ar,WQ. Don't get your ego all boosted up. :P   Right. I gotta go now. See ya next time. Most probably not tomorrow though. I got lotsa minutes to type tomorrow. Heh. TaTa! Night blog!
