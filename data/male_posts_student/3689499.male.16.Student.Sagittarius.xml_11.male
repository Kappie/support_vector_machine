I've just read an article in The Japan Times(2004/6/3 page3) about the booming blogging, so I thought "Cool! Gotta try it out!"...and now I'm here starting a blog which I've known for only like half an hour. Welcome! There's still nothing here but check it out sometime later and you may find something interesting!!;-) OK I'm going to try to get to know this bloggy thingy so see ya later!
