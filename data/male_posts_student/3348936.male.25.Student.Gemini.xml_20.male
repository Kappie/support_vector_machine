And then went to do some lab work only to find that the students haven't left me any reagents. AND its to late to go down to stores.  Grrrr.  On top of that I leave home to get to a night out at 7:30 and get there at 8:00.  Only to realise I have miss read the text message.  Nobody was arriving until 8:30.  It would have been okay if it hadn't started to piss it down with rain...
