Mr. Um kind of...tries, but we're so rooted in tradition that we can't branch out into New Age stuff.  Maybe I can use my influence next year to kind of help the band along.  I know a lot of people would like to see our band become both a high-quality and high-enterainment band, so why not add some 97.5 or 104.5 to our repertoire?  I'm all for it ;-)
