But despite the less than desireable age range, they are suprisingly very well behaved.  Yesterday was by far, the BEST arrival day of my Village career.  The sun was shining.  All my guys came within an hour of each other.  We were way ahead of schedule.  I couldn't ask for more.  Today we blessed the camp.  I love that.  I love that blessing something isn't "magic."  The world was already good.  We're not making it good.  We're just giving it back to God.  that's our job.  nothing else. Yep.  I still miss Elenie.  How does one go from every single day to completely cut off.  I'm addicted to Elenie and I was forced to give her up cold turkey.   Hello.  My name is Jesse Robinson and it's been 2 weeks and 1 day since my last hug from Elenie.  The thing is, I want to fall off this wagon.  =(  Oh well.
