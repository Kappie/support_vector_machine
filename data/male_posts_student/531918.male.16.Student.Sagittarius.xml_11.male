With that opening line, this disc starts into its head rush of pounding guitars, eerie keyboards, and other instrumental effects that will astound you as it continues onward on its odd path.  I have to say it. They sound quite similar to Radiohead.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. "Blackout" and "Butterflies and Hurricanes" feature some Baroque-esque classical instrumentation that appears out of nowhere, yet it fits in well. Electronic rhythms dominate in songs such as "Hysteria" and "Apocalypse Please". A return to earth occurs with the pounding guitars of "Time Is Running Out" and "Stockholm Syndrome", my favorite track.  Overall, this CD is very good. Is it perfect? No. Is it vital to your collection? Absolutely.  Rating: 5/5
