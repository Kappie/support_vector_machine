I'm off to C(the wizard)YB in about an hour now, so by the time I've finished this post >_  *whines* My chest huuuuuuuuuuurts. See yesterday for reason, it hurts. Waaah.  Ended up talking to Laura at about 2PM today, for she had a free and came home. So we had a taaaaaaalk. I couldn't really think of much to say, though. My conversational skills leave a little to be desired.  Just talked to Nikky, too. Nikky being Laura's friend. Laura is not online, but Nikky was, and is now leaving me on me own. So I'm blogging again. *strums guitar*  This post has already taken me 30 mins. Quit while I'm ahead.  Quote of the day: "Life without Cosette means nothing at all. Would you weep, Cosette, should Marius fall? Would you weep, Cosette, for me?"  From   Drink With Me   From the Musical   Les Mis√®rables   Love, Jon Roskilly
