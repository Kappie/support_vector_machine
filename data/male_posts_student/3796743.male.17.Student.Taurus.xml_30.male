I don't wanna leave my life as it is, I don't wanna leave my friends, my lifestyle. I'm afraid of having to start all over, and mostly being poor. Cause I will be...I'm afraid. But shhhhh! don't tell anybody! I've always been the type to face my future right in the eyes and take it on. That's what I'll do..but nobody said I can't have hesitiations.  Today was a good day. I woke up at noon. Cleaned my room. Went tanning. Then went to the play at Capital. Man of La Mancha. It was good. Kinda confusing, but good. Then Emmy, Alex, Adi and I all went over to Max's house to hang out for a few hours. It was good times. These are gonna be the things I don't wanna give up. But I know I have to, and there will be way better times after them. Tomorrow, I'm not doing much. Sleepin in prolly havin lunch with my mom or something.  In other news, the plan is still in effect. Going strong, and still on schedule. Can't wait for it.  I'm super tired. I'm going to bed now. I'll leave you with a really sad little story that Alex just sent me. it makes me depressed inside. G'nite everybody.  I read of a reverend who stood to speak at the funeral of his friend. He referred to the date on her tombstone from the beginning... to the end. He noted that first came the date of her birth and spoke of the date with tears but he said what mattered most of all was the dash between those years. For that dash represents all the time that she spent alive on earth, and now only those who loved her know what that little line is worth. For it matters not how much we own; the cars, the house, the cash. What matters is how we lived and loved and how we spend our dash. So think about this long and hard, Are there things you'd like to change? For you never know how much time is left You could be at "dash mid-range" If we could just slow down enough to consider what's true and real, and always try to understand the way other people feel, and be less quick to anger, show appreciation more and love the people in our life like we've never loved before. If we treat each other with respect, more often wear a smile remembering that this special dash might only last a little while. So when your eulogy is being read with your life's actions to rehash...would you be pleased with the things they say about how you spent your dash?  G'nite.
