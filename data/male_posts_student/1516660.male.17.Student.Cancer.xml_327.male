Consider today's blog entry non-existant. I have totally NO mood to blog. I feel terribly lousy at the moment. I can't convey my emotions properly.....  Actually, I wanna pour out what's inside me.... I just...can't find the right words. Okay okay...I say what's troubling me. You see ar...on the train back to Woodlands, I suffered incessant teasing from WQ.   HA! You all think I let that get to my head. Yeah...I am weak. I can't take insults... Words do hurt. A lot. I don't really blame WQ. You see, I was the one who started this lor. I called him names first, and his need to "shoot back" caused all that insulting. Yeah....can say I am huogai la. Stil...the words do hurt a lot. I've let all that get into my head.... I think I know what will be Amanda's and Wendy's reaction. They will shake their heads and go "you are hopeless". Or something along that line. Oh well.   See ya tomorrow. Bye blog.
