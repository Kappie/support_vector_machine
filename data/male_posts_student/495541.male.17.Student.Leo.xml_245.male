I'm not sure whether it's because the skin is reattaching, and bumping around causes pain because it's ripping... but that was just my thought.  One fun part about having stitches is that I have my wonderful teammates in basketball trying to make me laugh when they very well know that if I laugh, or smile it'll hurt big time.  Only way I can adjust my face is if I curl my lip into my mouth.  The bulge of my lip stretches out my lip when I smile because it rubs against my teeth.  You know what I mean.  Ahh, but I'll have em out by Saturday night.  Right now the muscle above my heart is jumping around.  Weird feeling.  Feels like I have a second heart.  Just twitching every now and then.  Maybe that means I'm going crazy because my brain's not functioning.  That would be really sad if that was really the case and I'm just laughing about it right now.  On another note, Dad got the battery grip for the 10D.  This means that I won't like the camera as much as before.  I don't like the grip because it makes the camera so much more bulky and professional.  I can't be using that camera in any situation or it'll make me look like a real nerd.  I have hopes that we'll get the Digital Rebel as a backup.  Pretty much the same camera with few differences on the outside.
