Then I came home, ate dinner,threw on some PJ pants and an old T-shirt and pretended to paint. I think this sucker will actually go on the wall. I'm not very good at painting, but it's fun to do it and think.Then moreoften than not Ithrow the canvas away and count my losses. 1, 2, 3, 4... LOSS.    Here is how lazy I am:    I went to Wal-Mart tonight (no, that's not the reason I'm so lazy, shit, YOU'RE lazy for not wanting to sit through the story.. stay with me). At Wal-Mart I decided to treat myself to a Pepsi, since I have been so good about not drinkingany sodas. I wasexcited to learn that there was a BILLION DOLLAR twist-off-cap-contest-thing. Then I realized you have to enter the code from the cap into a website. I got home, figured it was worth a shot, and half way through, I got bored with the 6 questions it asked, and closed the internet browser. A BILLION dollars, and I was too lazy to finish filling out "Name:____, Phone:_____, Blood Type:______, Penis Size:_____" etc. I just didn't care. Keep your damn Billion dollars, Pepsi. How are they giving away a BILLION dollars anyway? I don't buy it, not even for a billion dollars I don't buy it.    I shall have a hard time getting to sleep tonight. I coasted into my apartment about about 4:Something AM last night from drinking and was about ready to hit the sheets when I realized there were no sheets to hit. "Fuckin' A" I half-heartedly exclaimed, as I made my way to the washing machine which housed my wet, ready-to-be-dried sheets. I had to put those dirty bastards (well, clean bastards really) in the dryer and sit around cross-eyed for a good 40 minutes until I could make my bed. Needless to say it was around sunrise when I drifted off into dreams. I managed to make it past the hour of 2pm before getting out of bed. Good morning world, lets eat!    Now, I sit in my dining room, apartment lit up like a 90 year old's birthday cake, beer sitting next to me, empty pepsi bottle (possibly containing the winning BILLION DOLLAR CODE) sitting next to that, and AOL Radio playing "That's The Night That The Lights Went Out In Georgia" (God that's a long song title).    Well, I can't promise it will be soon, but I will say goodnight and let the lights go out in Norman, or at least in my apartment. At 4:11am (the present time) I'm pretty sure the lights have been out in Norman for some time now.    Goodnight.
