Considering how little you're allowed to modify things because of the template design, it's nice to have some rounded edges and things to work with.  A few little things to mention:  I copied the relevant comments except for ones that didn't have any text.  I also transfered the names.  However, we have a new commenting system that is limited to 1000 characters or less, so some of you wordy people (like Tracheotomy man) will have to split it like I did for him.  It also allows for others to trackback if they want to blog about a specific post and they're Haloscan members too.  It just serves as a better way of linking up and networking.  The design has a few little flaws right now, but I'm done trying to work it out.  Speak up and let us know what you think.  Remember, this is a forum for everyone, we're just the topic moderators.  Ok, so a little more than that, but your comments inspire us to write more, so be heard people.  Thanks!
