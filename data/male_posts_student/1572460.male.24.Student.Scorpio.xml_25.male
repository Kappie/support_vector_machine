At times, the cube can act as a perfect place for convoluted minds to drift away deeper into their labryinth of dreams or to indulge in serious surreal activities. Not that I know of anybody else here who feels the same about this place. But Room 200 sure has that distint eerieness, especially when most of the folks here are known to go about their business in their own quiet manner. I almost hear faint whispers of people gossiping -  "Psst Psst...Man is a social animal, but this guy Atul never is...!" . Hey hey, no qualms about that. I am happily reconciled with kuo, my linux box. Whereas the room is on the quiescent side - the silence broken only by the harsh ringing of a phone or a hearty but equally loud burst of laughter - it does play host to a myriad of odours ranging from caramel coffee, hot chocolate, cinnamon tea and roasted turkey to exotic french perfumes and scented candles, and also to some ephemeral scents that you probably don't want to smell.  These days, a surreal activity for me is a dose of caffeine backed up by Pink Floyd's essentially psychedelic and trippy dreamscapes rocking in the background. What an ambience, this creates. I wonder how Pink Floyd's music feels when you get doped and become  comfortably numb , in Floydian terminology. Yeah right, they'll say. But then according to common belief isn't it always the thought that matters?! Well, maybe it doesn't matter in this case, or on the flip side it probably matters too much!  I was almost reduced to tears when some of Floyd's music started growing on me. Here's one great piece...   Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.  Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.  So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.  Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time. Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over, Thought I'd something more to say.   - Time,  urlLink Dark Side Of The Moon
