Anyway, I need to be at work in under an hour and it takes half an hour to get there with the bus, yet here I sit posting in something that no one will read instead of getting ready. I am a genius, I know.  I work at UCLA in the Neuro-Imaging department as a volunteer. You're probably thinking "Oh, he's just a volunteer who's taking his job WAY too seriously. I think I'll go laugh at him now." and you would have been right to laugh if I were just doing hours of Patient Escort at the hospital, but I might be getting a recommendation letter out of this, so it's important that I show up on time and consistently and bla bla bla. Laugh if you want; it's not like it really bothers me, but what are you laughing at? Meh, you might find this story kinda funny.  On Tuesday, I went into work armed with 5.25 hours of sleep. While I was working on a mask (explanation on what that is in footnote (no, not what Ann Coulter means by footnote)*) for one of the infant brains and forgot to bring my music with me. I use music to keep me up in times of exhaustion and focused in times of awakeness(?). Anyway, after spending 3 hours on something that should have taken 1.5 hours, I went off into a long reflection and fell asleep sitting up and with my eyes half-open (not normal for me. I usually collapse onto the nearest desk with my eyes shut). When I woke up, I noticed that 23 minutes disappeared and thought it very odd, but went on my "merry" way working. My boss, Rebecca, didn't see me sleeping or anything, which was good, and I could have kept it good if I wasn't stupid. When she asked how far along I was on the mask, I said "It's not done. I feel asleep half-way through." After taking the 1.342 second rule (I should really up that to 8 seconds for people who have a big effect on my future), I said it not realizing the ramifications. When I thought about it in those 1.342 seconds, it didn't sound nearly as stupid as when I uttered it and heard it back. As I said it, I thought "damn, this is a REALLY dumb thing to say and if there was a way to stop and change it, I would" but I was already saying "aslee" and at that point I knew I was screwed. Sigh some more.  Well, at least today I will bring my music, but my being stupid again will leave me with only 3 or so hours of music out of a 5 to 7 hour workday. I'd sigh again, but I'm too tired. I'll just say the word like I usually do. Sigh.  That is all... except the footnote.         -- Feanor  * Masking requires pretty much four key skills: using a keyboard, using a mouse, knowing how to get around UNIX relatively fluently, and knowing what you're looking at when you see an MRI. You essentially color in the brain of the MRI scans that get used for modeling, data analysis, and some other cool stuff.
