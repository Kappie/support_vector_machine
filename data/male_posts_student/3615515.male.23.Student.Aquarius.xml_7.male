However, sometime during the summers I did feel that a blog need not be a personal diary but it could also be a place where I put down my thoughts and feelings in a structured manner so as to make useful and, if not useful, at least interesting reading for people who, like me, have nothing to do with their time. Hence, the blog - Straight from the Heart.
