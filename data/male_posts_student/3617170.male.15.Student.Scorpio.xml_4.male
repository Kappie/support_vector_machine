Yeah, well, I'd like to see how you'd deal with it. You're just walkin' down the hallway, minding your own buisness, and then SMACK, face-first, into a wall. You might even fall down. Then you know what you'd do? You'd try again, like the wall magically disappeared. Finally, you'd turn around and go the other way. Well, the fly has no idea about the window, or why they can't get outside, just like you've got no idea about the wall. So don't laugh, it's not nice.
