He claims that he will win back friends and allies that President Bush has alienated. Well, I'd think that any country would like us more if our foreign policy became "bend over." Now Kerry's  urlLink claiming  that he'll be able to get more countries to send troops to the Middle East to relieve American troops. Load of crap -- the Old European nations like Germany and France never WANTED to send troops to Iraq. Why would they now? And why isn't anyone mentioning the "Coalition of the Willing" -- the nations that sent troops to Iraq. This "Coalition" includes the  urlLink majority of Europe . But apparently the only "friends and allies" that matter to the Democrats are Kofi Annan, Germany, and France. And what's this crap still coming up about our withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaties? As I recall, those treaties were signed with the Soviet Union. Who can find the Soviet Union on the map? That's because it DOESN'T EXIST anymore.
