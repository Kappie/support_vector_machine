I've also realised how distant i've become from God. Right now, i feel perfectly fine, pretty happy in away, but empty inside. That only tells me how temporary this pseudo-happiness is. I've become so drawn into the riches of this world, i've not stopped to consider whats really important for the next. Right now, i wish to return to prayer with God, to tell him how sorry i am for leaving his company, for not being a good neighbour, for not appreciating my friends, for not trusting in him, and for even allowing evil thoughts to corrupt me. Sadly, its not easy. I've apparently lost this love for prayer, and i've lost the will power to devote time to God. To my friends, though you may not know it, i've sinned against you in so many ways, in so many thoughts.Please forgive me, and pray for me, that i will return to prayerto seek theLord, andto answer hisvoice....
