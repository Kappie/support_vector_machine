Got home, slept, next day went to Fry's and bought a brand new MoBo and 256 MBs of DDR 3200 memory.  Picked up a GeForce 5200 FX 128 MB 8x AGP video card.  Then I jet over to Best Buy and picked up a 40 Gig Hard drive and a new all digital dance pad.  Its soo nice.  (I still use the other one, but now I can do versus)  Anyways, yup, you guessed it!  I'm on a brand new re-built computer.  I built this computer myself and its running soooo smooth.  It handles all my games like a dream.  I get about 80 FPS on No Limits with the highest settings.  I have almost all my games on there, including my DDR simulator with 98 different songs from 1st thru 3rd Mix.  This thing runs so nice.  Only thing that pissed me off was that it had integrated audio.  Oh well, saves me the trouble of screwing with my Ensoniq sound card, I'll probably give it to my sister's computer that I'm working on.  Anyways, here are the specs on my brand new computer.  CPU - 478 pin Celeron 1.7 Ghz Memory - 256 MB DDR 3200 Video - 128 MB DDR nVidia GeForce 5200 FX HDD - Western Digital 40 Gig Hard Drive with 2 MB cache at 7200 RPM CDROM - Toshiba 12x CDROM (had to scrounge a working one up) Audio - Integrated (ehh oh well)  The best thing about this is that it all cost under $300!  I get $10 back on my dance pad and my $30 back on my hard drive, so I have to see what I'll be doing next.  I'm gonna go tune this sweet machine and load my other 300 billion games on it.  -Signoff-
