Eh, who's keepin' count anyway?  ( Nick )  Whoever is, fuck you...bastards.  Anyway, haven't been on in a while and haven't blogged in an even longer while so...yeah...I'm on now, so why don't I blog?  I'm doin' that right now, dumbass.  So anyway, I had a pretty good day today.  In fact, it really kicked ass, if you ask me.  I went out with my bestest bud in the whole-wide-motherfuckin'-world,  Eddie .  Damn, dude, we've been chillin' a lot huh?  Fo sho!  It took us awhile to get it all planned out though...shows how retarded we really are...  Anyway, it started with  Eddie  havin' a charge on a book (Oh no,  Nick !  A crime against humanity!) he checked out like a little while ago.  Luckily, he noticed in time and had to pay a small fine...unlike me, where I've got like a  $30.00+  charge ( Nick  is now chantin' "Hang him!  HANG HIM!") on my library card.  It sucks...I wanna pay it off, but I always end up spendin' my saved up lunch money on other crap.  Anyway, the  CPL  is just a bunch of whores who freakin' havta charge shitloads of money for there stupid ass books.  Seriously...I've seen yer books guys...they ain't in "mint-condition"...stop lyin' to yerselves!  And then they got that fuckin'  Project Parental Choice  (a.k.a.  Project Another Sorry Ass Attempt to Protect Your Kids' Minds from the Evils of An Evil Society ).  What happened to the kids' choice?  What happened to our freedom, eh?  We've got minds of our own you know, we can think for ourselves...and anyway, what are they tryin' to hide from us?  They got porn and shit stashed in the shelves or somethin'?  Really...come on...  Anyway, sorry I branched off on that... Gary  dropped us off at the mall, and another misadventure begins!  Its weird, cuz goin' to the mall on weekends has become like a ritual for us or somethin'.  Watch us devolve into the mall rats we swore to ourselves that we wouldn't become!  Hey, the mall is fuckin' fun OK.  Hah, its pretty funny, cuz we never have any cash to spend on things, so we just walk around and say things like,"Oh!  Hey, look at that!  I wish I could have that!"  Or we just spend our money on stupid shit that doesn't really matter.  Today, though, we had a little cash, and so we got to do a little spendin'...In fact, I was goin' to the mall with the prospect that I would be  makin'  cash...We walked our asses on over to  EB Games  and I thought I'd trade in one of my video games.  Turns out that the piece of shit was worth  $4 !  Ah, fuckin' douchebags!  Oh well,  Eddie  got to reserve this  Star Wars  game he wanted and I got $4 out of it...so why not go on a spendin' spree?  We did...or well..I did...at the arcade!  Yep, we headed over to  Tilt  and played our new  Arcade Game of the Week .  Its this game called  CarnEvil .  Its yer classic first-person shooter with the undead roamin' around tryin' to hurt you (What the fuck did we ever do to you guys!?), but with a creepy amusement park settin'.  Its so fuckin' koolaid, somebody, anybody, go and play it!  Bring a friend!  You guys will laugh yer asses off!  I know we did!  Anyway, I kept tryin' to win at this game for suckers, which I obviously am, and kept losing...I see a gambling problem in the not so distant future, don't you?  After that, I thought we should just walk back to my house (neither of us can drive legally) and so we did, laughin' our asses off about things that really aren't even that funny...Hey!  We think they are...so fuck off!  After like 30+ mins. and a broken beer bottle later...we arrived at my house...only to find that the doors were all locked, no one home, and no way to get in...Great!  But wait!  Next door neighbor to the rescue!  I asked them to use their phone (nervously, cuz thats the kinda person I am) and yeah...I got a hold of my sister and luckily she was headin' back home as we were speakin'.  So that was cool and I found out that one of the chicks next door was pretty fuckin' cute.  Anyway...yeah we got in...and I got to show  Eddie  this super koolaid new game I got called  Disgaea: Hour of Darkness .  I oughta blog about that later.  I also let him listen to the  Freestyle Latin Hip-Hop CD  that we've got, and we laughed once more at the synthesized goodness!    After that, we went to  Norm's  and I found out  Eddie  was a  Norm's Virgin , so it was his first time.  With my guidance, as well as my sisters  Stacie  and  Chu-Chi , we were able to make it comfortable for  Eddie  and things went smoothly.  Heh,  Eddie , we got to try the  gumbo !  Oh yeah, we saw  Brittany McCorkhill  she's changed...wow...Anyway...we had a pretty good dinner, despite the annoyin' little girl that was bawlin' two tables over (Whats wrong bitch?  You hot?  You got a feeva?), crazy guy with an even crazier laugh, and of course our waitress, which  Eddie  appropriately donned the name  Purple Petunia  who was nice, I guess, but she didn't really come back to our table to ask if we needed anythin'...which she shoulda, cuz  me  and  Eddie  ordered that little "steak with all the shrimp you can eat" dealie (Bitch, I ain't no fishamen...I can't catch this shit mah-self!)  All in all, we had a pretty good fuckin' time, and it was the highlight of my weekend, so yeah...had to share that with you all!  OK OK, more to come...!
