Just kidding, sorry, I don't know where that came from.  Now I'm really sad that I didn't go to MOM!!!  Wait, was Kelly in it?  Cuz if she was...I swear to Buddha...she's dead!!!  That evil little girl hasn't talked to me in so long!  COMSTOCK!  Tell Kelly to talk to me.  Got it?  I don't even particularly care which one of you does it...I know that both of you know her.  But not everyone does, so, back to my point.  What was my point?  Oh yeah.  I haven't been here in forever!  And, as retarded as I am, I so can NOT find this calendar thing.  I know that you explained everything earlier, Michael, and I thank you for that, but I'm much too lazy to go back and look, and, besides, I'm only writing this to procrastinate more on writing my Drama critique.  You know what?  I just won't do it!  I was just doing it for extra credit anyway.  Well, poo on that!  If I may say so myself!  HMMPH!  Anyway.  Again.  Bye!  I want to STUFF the MONKEY!
