If we never have anything more than that, so be it, but I will NOT lose a friend over this.  Two days ago, I got a random email through match.com.  Yeah, I'm on match.com.  I've had a profile up for 3 years, and was recently thinking about the futility that is finding someone on that site.  Figure, I get 3 emails a week with about 20 "matches" in them.  Plenty are repeats, but whatever.  So, 3 emails a week for 3 years, that's 3 x 156, which is 468, I think.  So 468 emails, with 16-20 people each, and over the course of those years and those emails, I've found fewer than a dozen, probably fewer than 8 people who I found interesting enough to even consider dropping $25 to email and open up a line of communication with.  I met one person, we went on a couple dates, wasn't quite right, we remain friends.  Met another person, immediately wasn't quite right, we're uh... occasional IM friends, but really have very little in common aside from a general hope that the other is alive, healthy, and happy.  Staggering odds, no?  So back to this email.  Girl who wrote it is gorgeous.  And articulate, and unique (oh my goodness... someone whose profile says more than "nice girl looking for the right one.  I like going out and having fun, but am equally happy curling up on the couch and staying in.")...  So I bite.  I drop the cash for the membership so I can respond to her email.  And she responds almost immediately.  And I respond again.  And she IMs me.  We talk for a couple hours, then both need to go to errands and be productive.  Get back from errands, talk for another 4 hours.  Good conversation, covered a lot of ground.  I'm not saying this is a match made in heaven, or that it ever will be anything, but my faith is renewed in my ability to find people who actually might consider wanting to be with me, ever.  And hell, that's a start.  And an important one after this weekend then the unpleasant surprise waiting when I called UMass.  I shouldn't be surprised.  It was an a cappella hookup.  Those things don't last.  Anyway, I retire to bed this evening a changed and slightly happier man.  God has been good to me in so many ways, and I'd have to be a pretty selfish, clueless SOB to think otherwise.    I have a hard time believing anyone reads this anymore anyway.  I've taken so long to update and all.  Am I wrong?  Go ahead, prove it.  Leave a comment. ;)
