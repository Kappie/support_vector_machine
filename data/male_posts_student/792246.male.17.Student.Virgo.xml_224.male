Toby wins the award for "One of the most intoxicated people I've ever seen". Be honored Tom. Thomas consumed half a bottle of vodka on top of some cheap wine shit, and then champagne at midnight. Tobias then proceeded to invent the newest verb in the English language, "bedroom". As in, "Camden, go bedroom her!", or, "Kelly wants to be bedroom!" Note, it would appear to be its own plural. He spent the rest of the night trying to sleep with Claudia, followed by some very sexy passing out and vomiting on his shirt and the carpet.   On the surface it may have looked like there was sex going on all the time we were there, through some investigation we discovered that  none  had actually occured. This upset me.  I saw Return of the King finally. Good movie. We all clapped when Orlando Bloom exclaimed, "A diversion!" ...the longest word he ever said.  Eowyn should jump in my pants. Not Miranda Otto, just Eowyn. I still hold that cutting the Shire scene was retarded and retarded at the same time.  So, tomorrow is Hamlet Day. Personally, I'm excited. Kelly and I might spend the night at Jonathan's so we don't have to wake up super early and make our way there on our own power.  Happy New Year everyone. I never thought 2004 would ever actually come.  Oh, and Toby? I grabbed your ass while you were drunk.
