Kind of a strange feeling, considering I've been working toward this degree for five years now.  Once again, as with a lot of things going on in my life, I've got that bittersweet feeling in me right now.  Sure, I'm definitely not going to miss all the stress and long hours of studying, but what I am going to miss are the friendships that have developed over the past five years with my classmates.  I've spent the majority of the past four years of classes with the same group of about 25 of us, so I've gotten to know most of them pretty well.  For those people I don't care for in our class, this has been bad, but for those classmates of mine who I've become good friends with, it's going to be tough facing the reality I won't be seeing them on a regular basis anymore.  One of my good friends in my class is already married and has a kid on the way this summer, several more of my friends have accepted jobs out of town, so I'm starting to realize I'm starting to get old.     As with a lot things, the big advice I can give people is to enjoy things while they last, because sooner or later, all good things will come to an end.  Enjoy every one of those weekends while you're in college, because before you know it, you'll be out in the real world living the boring, uneventful life.  Enjoy the friendships you develop, because eventually you'll all move on in different paths in life.  Enjoy those activities you become involved with, because sooner or later, your time will come to move on.  And lastly, enjoy life as it is.  Be thankful with what God had handed to you and make the most of it.
