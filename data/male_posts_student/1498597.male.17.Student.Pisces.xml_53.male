Duh, who else stays up this late besides me?  And its only midnight!  I don't really consider that late, but then again, (as everyone always says) the way I perceive time doesn't exactly cater to a  "normal person's"  standards.  Oh well, on with the blog, shall we?   Not much to update about on right now.  The site is goin' threw the usual...thing...whatever that is.  Umm, I guess  Nick  and  I  should work a little more on the pictures and stuff.  Its really been awhile since we actually used those, isn't it?  And we obviously don't update the quote weekly...its more like weekly and give or take two or three days.  Well, we'll try to be more up-to-date and on task with our obligations to the site!  Today I went to  Naoki's  house, joined by  Josh  and  Eddie .  We had a really wicked time playing  Mario Party 4 .  That game is seriously created for multiplayer madness.  Speakin' of great multiplayer VG's, a classic favorite,  Super Smash Bros. Melee  also made its appearance, and as always, it fuckin' owned.  We also watched the  Animatrix , and it was very interestin'.  I mean come on,  anime  and the concept of the  Matrix  combined!  Think of the endless possibilities!  We also dug up  Naoki's   Super Famicom , or known in the  West  as  Super Nintendo , and played some games he had accumulated over his childhood years.  He also made us a great lunch.  Thanks a lot  Naoki !  Oh yeah, and if your goldfish are pregnant, congratulations!  Speakin' of goldfish, I'll try to do some research on goldfish breedin' in captivity.  What can I say?  I really like fish keepin', and its always nice to lend a helpin' hand I guess.  Well, thats pretty much it for now.  I don't think I'll be goin' to bed anytime soon, but yeah...Great, the 'rents are up.  Well, I'll try to bring ya more if I can.  Later!
