After posting somewhere else in a totally different way  (I was posting about my boring life, imagine that...)  I noticed t'was not what I wanted anymore... I need to write things which people who don't know me are able to understand, and that people who know me are able to relate back to me... So... I am back.  Kisses for those who deserve it, hugs for those who don't, GPTO
