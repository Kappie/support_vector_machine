It was a lot smaller, and basically did everything the one I ordered was supposed to do... only the pictures looked nothing like they would on the ordered one.  God I was mad!  I tried to like it, but I was ust too disappointed.  It has now turned into a gift for someone and I'm getting payed some money.  I have purchased the right one from a SHOP this time!  Screw eBay lol.  Anyway, apart from that little pain in the arse, my last couple have days have been really cool.  Been out a bit with everyone.  I went to see I, Robot last night and it was amazing!  There was one hilarious bit in it, where Will Smith sneezes suddenly and goes, "Sorry, I'm allergic to bullshit."  The trailers didn't look that good, but it turns out the movie was really good.  It was set in 2035 and there were some clever changes in technology etc.  Probably won't be staying in an Alton Towers themed suite now.  It doesn't matter that much though, we don't get any free merchandise or brilliant room, but Grandad is gonna buy us an Axcellerator Pass each, and they are about Â£72 each!  Dunno whats happening this week.  Won't be doing much, but next week the fun begins!  Lots of things to get done!
