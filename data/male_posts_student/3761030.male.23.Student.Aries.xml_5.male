I am finishing my final year at Georgia Tech with degrees in Computer Science and Industrial and Systems Engineering. Actually there is a brief story as to why I have both of these degrees. I was working on my Computer Science degree when I saw for the first time the movie  urlLink Office Space . This movie changed my life for the better, instead of being Peter the dorky computer scientist I realize I would rather be one of the dorky Bob's who fires everyone, thus the ISyE degree. However, by the time I made this decision I had already gone through the "weed out" courses for Computer Science, and felt that with it only requiring one additional year for both degrees I might as well do both. So I am.   While, I like "all things" computer-related, my favorite pasttimes aside from Videogames, have to be beta testing and Personal Video Recorders. I got my first PVR, a  urlLink TiVO , freshman year at Tech. The TiVO was great and all, but very limited. For starters it could only hold 30hrs, could not be remotely accessed for viewing or scheduling, and lacked integrated archiving. Regardless I kept my TiVO for several years, even somewhat "worshiping" it until September 03 when I came across Snapstream's  urlLink BeyondTV . It was like  urlLink Windows Media Center PC  with about a million additional features. I had actually seen Snapstream's software originally when its sister-app PVS2 was beta testing more than a year back but at that time it was no competition with my TiVO. I became rather "popular" over on Snapstreams Forums and in May I actually landed a part time work at home job. I do technical support by email for the company approximately 10 hours a week, not a enough to live off, but a few extra dollars is always enjoyed. Before I got the job I had also became interested in another PVR application by the name of  urlLink SageTV . Before I worked for Snapstream, I was actively beta testing for both companies. Infact, although few know this I have had full access to SageTV Studio, a yet to be release title from the Sage Folks. I also have done beta testing of  urlLink Meedio . All of these companies make great products, and right now I support all three of them, despite two of them are technically my companies competitor. Other notable Beta Testing Invites include several closed test for Microsoft operating systems. Although now and days, I value a stable machine, and my spare one is a dedicated htpc. And just recently I got invited to  urlLink Gmail , but considering invitations are sold $.99 on  urlLink Ebay  I no longer consider it a "closed" beta test.   So what will you find here? Well, specializing in "software architecture" I tend to be a very creative person, I plan to use this blog to jot down my thoughts and feelings on feature request that I have made or seen using "official" channels. These ideas will initlally be focused around GMail and Snapstream products as those are my current main interest.   -Brett
