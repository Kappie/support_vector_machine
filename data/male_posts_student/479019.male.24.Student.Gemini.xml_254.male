I don't know if anyone reading this is anyone from my grad school... but I'm sick of talking about factions, cliques, etc. I've never been one to fit into one and I don't plan on it. My fellow new students know it's bullshit too... but someone told me that some of them have hints of being associated with or drawn into them already. You know what? This stuff is retarded and as long as people are still cool to me, then I have nothing bad to say about them. If someone starts being an asshole or bitch to me then it's a different story.   As  Bad Religion  sings... fantastic images and hope are linked. This applies to a lot of things.  In rotation right now is some  Social Distortion .  ****
