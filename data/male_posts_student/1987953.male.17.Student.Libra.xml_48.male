Annie once said, "The sun will come out... tomorrow..." Mike once said, "Shut the f[arm] up!" Well, she's right. When your life and heart are full of darkness, just wait, and the sun will come out tomorrow and brighten it. Don't live with regret. My Journalism friend Heidi says that regret will eat you. She's right. Don't let it eat you. Forgive yourself and try to make it up to yourself and that person.   Part of what made these last couple days great were talking to Kari on the phone a lot, that song  My Will  by D.C. Talk. Part of it was DC Talk's  song Consume Me , but all of it was God speaking to me about everything. Then, when I got to church, we read passages of Scripture (Isaish 43:1-3;41:10; Jeremiah 29:12-13) that really hit the spot that needed a touch from the Master's hand.   Isaiah 43:1-3:  1 But now, this is what the LORD says-  he who created you, O Jacob,  he who formed you, O Israel:  "Fear not, for I have redeemed you;  I have summoned you by name; you are mine.  2 When you pass through the waters,  I will be with you;  and when you pass through the rivers,  they will not sweep over you.  When you walk through the fire,  you will not be burned;  the flames will not set you ablaze.  3 For I am the LORD , your God,  the Holy One of Israel, your Savior;  I give Egypt for your ransom,  Cush and Seba in your stead.   Isaiah 41:10: So do not fear, for I am with you;  do not be dismayed, for I am your God.  I will strengthen you and help you;  I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.   Jeremiah 29:12-13: 12 Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 13 You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.   Then, what Pastor Blight, in his sermon, attacked about me next was my mindset that I just told Kendra about two days ago. He said that some people live as pessimists so that they expect the bad so that when it happens  they won't be disspointed. He said, "Isn't that a sad way to live?" Unfortunately, it is. Benjamin Franklin was a wise man, but he was wrong about that one. Brittany agreed with Pastor on the phone just now. So I went up to the alter and gave that mindset up to Him. I gave my life to Him. I gave my will to Him to conform to His will. Whatever happens in my life, He reigns and whatever He wants is best.   Bottom line, feeling happy and doing good. Keep praying. Hard days ahead, I'm sure. Satan tries to kill the good stuff.   So, I am going to see   urlLink The Passion of the Christ    on Tuesday. What did everyone who saw it think of it? I hear it's great and that I should go see it. Anyway, I'll find out.  Anyway, blog you later! Love and prayers for all of you! As many as I can individually everyday! If I have kept in touch with you even through this page or IM or E-mail in the last two months, be sure you're in my prayers. Everyone else, you probably are if I know who you are. I may not keep in touch well, but you're in my prayers!  In Christ, Mike >
