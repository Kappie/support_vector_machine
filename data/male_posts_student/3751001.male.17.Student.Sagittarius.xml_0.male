The link is http://www.atrocty.com/index.php so have a look if you want, i'm gonna try and find some decent tutorials and learn to make a more useful site.  My other site updates are to the forum, i've added some more skins which you can change in your profile control panel, i've yet to do any modifications to them but i will do over the next few weeks so watch this space!  Thats it for now, i'll update hopefully by tuesday again.  ~Atrocity
