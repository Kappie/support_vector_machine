I have doubts about my ability now. There are plenty of people better. Why should I make it. Dammit. I'll live with my dream and the belief that good things come to those who wait.  Kept thinking of her. Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head. Damn good song. Damn EMO now. 182 isn't all bad friends.  Tomorrow is the first day. I hope I like it in ACJC. I hope it'll last forever.  God Make me clean.
