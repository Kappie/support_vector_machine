I can still remember how u held my hand  Like u'd never let it go  But now here i am alone, trying to move on  Wondering how our love could go so wrong..   Will love come back to me  Come back again to me  When i still believe that u're the one i need  Though i'm trying hard to make it through  Living is so empty without u  And i wonder must we go on this way   U would catch my every fall  U'd forgive all that u knew was wrong with me  But i pushed it far away  Too scared to call it love  What i wouldn't give to have u back again   Will love come back to me  When love is just like u  If it isn't u, i don't know what to do  Know i gotta try and start again  I don't wanna find somebody new  Because i don't wanna go on this way   And if someday, in some dream we meet again  Baby do i have a chance to speak to u again?  I know that if i were to say 'i love u' now.  It's still to late  Just to say the words, i'll tell u anyway   Will love come back to me  Come back again to me  When i still believe that u're the one i need  Though i'm trying hard to make it through  Living is so empty without u  Baby tell me do we have to live this way?  Will love come back to me  When love is just like u  If it isn't u, i don't know what to do  Know i gotta try and start again  And the more i try and start again  The more i miss you  Baby, tell me somehow we'll find the way...   Really hope that u'll realise how much i love u one day...  Will always be waiting for u to come back.. no matter how long it's gonna take.  urlLink
