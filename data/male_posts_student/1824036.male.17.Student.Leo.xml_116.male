Ironically I saw  urlLink Chad  at the movie too. He was waiting for Ben, and couldn't find him so he sat by us (Jadie and I) to waste time.  Then Ben came, so they sat a row behind us.  What would have made this movie awesome would be if our movie theater had lazyboys in it :-) But on the plus side I did have my  urlLink Junior Mints  with me. I love  urlLink Junior Mints .
