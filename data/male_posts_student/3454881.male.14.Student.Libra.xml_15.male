Here's a fact, he only served in Vietnam for 4 months! That's barely anytime to get into action and cause an impact. Most of his coligues served for years! Not months. I get really annoyed when he uses his "experience" to influence people. I also get annoyed when he says he will use his experience to win the war on terror. hmm...what experience..?  Oh yea, how did he get those 3 purple hearts anyway????  The potential is unlocked.
