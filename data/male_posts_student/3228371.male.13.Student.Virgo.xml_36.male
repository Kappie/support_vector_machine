Some people told me that he had to t-shirts on and he took off one of them to keep the thingy un-wet. And Mark hit him in the jaw. He's hurt, wet, and tired! :( Poor Nemo. I miss Nima so much. Can't wait to see him tomorrow. Damn, I can't give him a huggie cos his parents'll be there. :( Maybe we can have the practise at Brian's or Roger's house? Calling Roger. Blog later.
