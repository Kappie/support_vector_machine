I'm sure all of you are familiar with how boxers (the underwear, not the hard-hittinglook and function... with the verticle slit in the front that serves as a fly where there may or may not be a button to keep it together.  In Wal-Mart there was this freak of nature that disturbed me greatly, I can't even imagine wearing it.  It was a boxer short with a pocket on the front.  Right in the middle.  It looked like a pocket that goes on the back of pants normally, but it was dead front and center.  Of course you can't keep change in this pocket, because there's a hole in it!  It's a penis pocket.  Reach in looking for your car keys... no no... there's something else in there!  It's just WRONG, man!
