Has the sponsor of FCA forgotten what FCA is all about? Yes, it is a time to gather, to have fellowship as Christians and honor  God   not  the football team. I haven't attended FCA in a few weeks because it is more of a get together and goof around time with some sort of speaker and I personally, along with a few other people, walk out of there without feeling like anything was learned. Anyway maybe it's just me that feels like FCA is being turned in the wrong direction. Maybe it's leadership or some sort of lack of student leadership but I will not be attending FCA in the morning if ever again. I would much rather gather with my friends and honor God on our own tomorrow morning then honor the football players. "FCA is not about honoring the football players it is about honoring God..." Me to Amory.
