There are probably a higher rate of websites dedicated to coffee than tea! And I just happen to be a tea lover - ah, glorious tea...  So for the next few days I'll be happily browsing about in the Internet or anywhere that may have any information on tea. I'm making tea as my main feature. Maybe I should change the blog's name, too...  Still reading  Sophie's World ...
