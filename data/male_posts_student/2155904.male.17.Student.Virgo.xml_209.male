Today was of course the Senior Presentations.  So they only had 3 periods today, 4th, 5th, and 6th.  In 4th period Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil showed their english video and it went over pretty well.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  And nobody noticed the fuck ups where Tyke said Laertes instead of Claudius because in the miracle that is editing, the guys just turned the sound to mute basically for that short part so that you can't hear Tyke say any name.  It was very smart of them.  And the rest of the period was spent being idle.  Then in 5th period Tyke worked with Macaroon on the final for physics.  The scavenger hunt is pretty hard.  It's gonna take a while to do and they only have a week to do it in.  But Tyke has worked on it already and he has about 10 answers so far.  And also he will be able to just copy off smart people so that works out pretty well.  After 5th period Tyke actually went to physics and got a few more answers done before heading off.  "The Executives" (named such because of their very business-like dress for their speeches) went out to Schlotzky's Deli for lunch.  The gang was Tyke (driving), Dr. Phil, Amed, Macaroon, and K-Caj.  They got behind a bus as they were driving and man did this ever fuck Tyke over.  Hardcore.  Like, this mistake cost Tyke a few thousand dollars.  Here's why...The bus was letting every other bus driver go out of the school and thus holding up traffic and making everyone behind them wait.  This is unacceptable.  Fuck that person.  Tyke was driving along and got onto Newport Way.  It turned out that Pauly was in front of him, and actually this saved Tyke a lot of trouble.  As they were driving the car in front of Pauly stopped very suddenly to turn left off the road thus making Pauly slam on his brakes to avoid hitting her.  He managed to stop but Tyke still had to do the same.  Tyke slammed on his brakes and started to slow down when his brakes went soft and pushed straight to the floor without giving any resistance and not acting like brakes should, to stop the car.  Tyke went slamming into the back of Pauly's SUV and Tyke was like, "ummm...shit."  Tyke wasn't really speeding very much as there was a lot of traffic so he couldn't but he was following too closely.  But his brakes flat out failed him and when Blume got out of the car to look at Tyke's car he goes "Ohhhh shiiiiiit..."  At first Tyke thought he was joking but then he got out and Tyke's hood was popped in, the grill was bent and sticking out, one of the headlights was bent a little and it just looked like a bit of a mangled mess.  Without really thinking they went to the place where the bitch lady turned in but there wasn't anything they could do.  And the most miraculous thing about this was that Pauly's car had absolutely no damage at all.  There is the spare tire on the back of the truck that managed to save his car.  Tyke couldn't even tell where he got hit because it was so un-damaged.  Everything worked fine so it was only Tyke's car that got damaged.  In reality that is a very good thing as Tyke only has to worry about the damage to his own car.  When he got to Schlotzky's he left a nice little message for his mom telling her what happened.  Then he ate and drove back to school for the presentation.  The actual presentation went fine.  Tyke was easily in the time limits and had no real struggles during the speech.  He got grilled by one lady and she kept asking stupid questions but he answered with ease.  That was simple.  Then he had to wait around for a long time as he was the second to go in the room.  He was glad he went early though.  It is way better to get it over with and have nothing to do than to have to wait through everything.  After that was over Tyke went outside and ripped off his clothes and then called his mom again.  She said she was pretty busy and didn't have time to talk so he was a little bit short with Tyke but he later found out she was actually pissed at Tyke.  But that got resolved as he will explain later.  Tyke then had to drive his car home and leave it there of course while Macaroon came over to pick him up and drive him around.  They went and got gas and then Tyke withdrew some money from the ATM before heading to Macaroon's to change and then to play some bball/frisbee.  They played there for a while and were joined by Dr. Phil, Fejj, K-Caj, and Maniak.  Then they left to pick up their tuxes.  Tyke's is tight.  All white...wait Tyke already explained its appearance.  But yeah it looks cool.  Tyke wasn't able to rent the hat that he wants to so he thinks he will go out to Redmond to try to get it there but it isn't a dire necessity for the outfit.  It would just look cool.  But anyways Macaroon drove Tyke home and then he talked about prom and his car.  His mom said that she was pissed cuz when Tyke said his brakes failed she thought he was just covering himself but when she checked it out she realized that Tyke was actually not lying, this time.  So basically, although Tyke was following too closely, he was not 100% at fault here.  Which made Tyke feel a little better but he is still guilty about the trouble he has caused.  But basically Tyke isn't in any trouble or anything and really his punishment is that tomorrow he has to drive the Avalon all day.  Haha, damn.  But yeah, that is taken care of.  And now Tyke has to wait for his dad to call so that they can go take Tyke's car to the shop tonight and leave it there.  Then they can have it get the brakes fixed to start with.  The hood still sorta doesn't open but eh, whatev.  So yeah, today has been pretty interesting.  Of course June is gonna be nice and full of crazy stuff like this.  Let's hope Tyke doesn't break his leg while he is walking for graduation.  That sounds like something that could happen if this pace is continued.  Tomorrow though is supposed to be fun.  Tyke will be pretty damn busy though.  But that is a good thing hopefully.  It will keep him having fun at least.  It's too bad that he can't sleep in tomorrow though.  Oh well, sleep can wait.  But now Tyke can't wait.
