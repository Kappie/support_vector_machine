The first night there we drank too much, talked about how cool we were in college, embellished stories, talked about love, debated whether or not we have been lied to by years of watching hollywood’s ideas about romance, whether love is roses and fireworks or something closer to what we have between us.  We hugged too much,  cooked and ate over ten pounds of meat, played wiffle ball as the sun came up, went to sleep about 7 am.    The next day,  sean made blueberry pancakes, we went for a hike, we talked about war, mideast peace, politics, blueberries, star wars.  Sean and ryan went for a swim in what must have been very cold water.  We ate some more meat.   We played poker for chips, (not the edible kind) we played drinking games, we painted pictures and carved soap.   The next day we cleaned up, and drove home.   Best bachelor party ever, I think.
