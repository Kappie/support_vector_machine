It was their mum at the phone, and she needed help from me to print something from a floppy disk.  Qi Xiang came to my house , and i got ready the stuff for printing. Printer, paper, and the com. I slotted the diskette in, but found it to be unformatted (faulty) and thus could not access the data inside. Qi Xiang went back and I followed shortly after. Went over to QX's house, and saw their mum's friend there, along withherhusband and daughter popping her head over the door. I saw her for the first time, and had a better glimpse of her when her family walked out the door.  My.. she looked good ! She was the kind of girl I had in mind ! The looks.. so nice and innocent... ! Haha.. Bleah. =P  As she went out, i noticed she was kinda sad.. I think its due to her compo being lost.. I felt kinda sad too, lol, since i wasnt too big a help to her. =S  I just wonder if she'll come again.. with her new diskette and ready to print again.. hope i can get more chances to meet her.. perhaps fate is creating a chance ? Then again.. naw.. doubt she'll fancy me.. hmm... I wont push it ba.. like Aaron said, 'Unlimited amount of chasing will get you the opposite effect instead'. Moreover, I dont even know her at all..So, I'll leave it all to Fate...  This event really had brightened my day ! (or night :p) I'm happy enough to have seen someone so stunning ! Thanks God !  Hee.. a good night's sleep awaits me..... :D
