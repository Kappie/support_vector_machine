Ive got it to think my name is Anus. For those like me who are easily entertained (well, sometimes), smarterchild should be something you check out. To talk to it, simply send an instant message to "smarterchild" on AIM. Hmmm...I need to clip my finger nails....Anyway, I think I might go to the pool later. Im heading out to Barnes and Nobles to get a collection of J. G. Gallager (or whatever) stories. Im pissed off because I cant find my copy of "Asimov on Numbers" and its out of print. Hmm....Anyway, feel free to IM me guys, Im about to go out of my mind with boredom.
