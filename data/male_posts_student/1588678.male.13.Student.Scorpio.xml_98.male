Very good album. For me, I love Wilco. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was like that first breath of sweet air as you come up from underwater for me. But this new album, was, well, different. I mean, at first I was trying to decide if it was good or just unlistenable. I mean, the songs are longer, no choruses, ect. They all start off acoutical and quiet and then towards the end it's just a big jam of electric guitar and piano. I'll be honest, it took me a couple times of listening to the album to realize that I  really  enjoy it. But I still can't figure out my favorite song. Either "The Late Greats" or "Spiders (Kidsmoke)," which is a 10-minute guitar-riff jam that turns back into a simply but hypnotizing beat that stays in your mind all day!    Make sure you go and buy it. You'll love it! But believe me, you'll have to listen to it at least 3 times, song to song, to really live it!  Night-night! Keep ya butt tight!
