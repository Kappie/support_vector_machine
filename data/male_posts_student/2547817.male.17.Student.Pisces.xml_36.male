Went to West Mall and chilled with Angeline for about 30 minutes. Decided to take a 173 home to relive something. Changed to 970 and helped a lady retrieve her fluorescent yellow highlighter. It fell to the ground as she boarded. Sat beside a sleeping Indian who woke up and began cursing and swearing at the bus driver, calling him an incompetent dumb driver who must have been from Johor. He said that if the bus driver were a smart driver, he'd be "driving" a plane. I was greatly amused my a ranting madman after a shitty day.  Thank you God for ranting madmen on buses who amuse us.
