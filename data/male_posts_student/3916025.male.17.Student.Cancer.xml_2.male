I saw a lot of people which include my crush. We saw a couple of bands together and we talked a lot. I got to see  Yellowcard  with him. They are my all time favorite band and we sang all of their songs together. It was so  amazing .   2 . This holiday weekend, I found out that I am getting ungrounded in 3 weeks for sure. Also I went to Brittney's for a famous sleepover with Rachel. We stayed up until  4:30 AM . It wasn't really smart because I had to be up at  7:00 AM  to be at the church for a breakfast. So I got up at  7:15 AM  and Brittney dropped me and Rachel off home. Then me and my family went to the parade, went to a lake, and came home all wet and stinky. Yuck!   3 . Today has been ok. Not too great but I'll survive. For this week coming up I have some plans. First there is Young Men's and Young Women's on the 27th of this month. Then on that same day and the next day are senior and graduation pictures. In August there is registration on the 11th and my sister's birthday on the 22nd and school starting the next day. I hope 3 weeks goes by really fast so I can have some fun for the rest of my boring summer. I'll be back next week I guess   .
