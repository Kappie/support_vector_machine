Whatever.  Mummy, Pati, Tata, Mama and auntie Violet all chipped in to get me an N-GAGE. It's neat, but it's very difficult to SMS with.... I got $170 in addition to that. Gave $20 to offering today. God says we should give at least 10% of what we have. It's an obligation, so why is it called an offering?  Shajahan would be celebrating his birthday today too. Pity he died. Somebody's thinking of you dude...  I made a wish before I blew out the candles. That some form of reparation would come for me and Zel. Maybe birthday wished are only valid for BIRTHDAYS and not the night before. I was hoping for a call from her today. I got an SMS at 815pm that said "Hey, happy birthday". Well, it's better than nothing. Who am I trying to kid?  I dreamt of her again 2 nights ago. I cant remember where we were but I do remember that she stuck out her hand, the way she always did and wanted me to hold it. I did and she rubbed my had. I was happy. Happier than I've been in weeks. I live a sad life now, you know that when your dreams bring you joy.  I will try to start again. Kick my old ways and embrace what I will of myself. At the end of this year, I aim to be pleased at my evaluation. As for my evaluation of my 16th year, I am pleased. God was good to me this year.   I'll miss sweet sixteen.
