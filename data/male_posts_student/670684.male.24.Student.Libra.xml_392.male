What is it?    Steve Winwood - Valerie (a script song...I'll explain that term later) David Gray - Be Mine Better Than Ezra - Under You David Bowie - Fashion REM - Radio Free Europe Erasure - I Love You (their most overlooked work...dance pop with some Morrisey thrown in) David Bowie - If I'm Dreaming My Lifew Moby - Love of Strings Steve Winwood - The Finer Things Hall  Oates - Say it Isn't So Bon Jovi - This Ain't a Love Song Morrisey - Trouble Loves Me Figures on a Beach - Accidentally 4th Street (Gloria) Figures on a Beach - No Stars James - Say Something Polyphonic Spree - Soldier Girl Simple Minds - Alive and Kicking  Not as college alt as I originally assumed, but I'm an 80s nut...at least it's not laden with hits.  I like the sap when I write.  It makes me feel fuzzy.    Frank's having a "procedure" done tomorrow, as my grandmother explained it to me.  She told me a week ago in passing, as she does to make sure I don' t worry.  And I forgot, as happens often, except I called them late tonight to ask a question about former Palm Springs City Councilman Chuck Maurowski (sp?) for use in my thesis...I went to the victory celebration for him and Dana Hodges in 1990, and it is pertinent to my thesis report, so there.  Anyway, the procedure was mentioned again (he's got diabetes, and a vein in his leg is closing up, so he's got to have a stent put in).  Probably the least intrusive surgery he's had in years, but it's still a concern.  Few people I enjoy more in the world than Frank Wiskowski.  And in true form, he would rather lament Georgia Tech's poor first half shooting in the NCAAs rather than even bring up his health issues.  Part of me hopes I don't find a job before my Kansas gig ends, just so I can go spend a month in Palm Springs, finding part time PA work and taking him to the gym in the afternoons (I rarely work out so regularly).  And enjoying that pool on the outside...the greatest. pool. ever.
