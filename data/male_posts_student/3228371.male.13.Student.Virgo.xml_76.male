Relationships as in friendships. Yeah... Hmm, I really wanna run over to Nima's place to help his sister out with her midi stuff but I can't. :( My mommy won't let me... if she isn't done by tomorrow, I'd go over after school and help. 'Cos I can help her get a program that makes it into a midi. Blah... I hope she gets it complete in time.   Nima~ Hee hee~ My favourite guitarist/rocker. My alien. My perfect boyfriend. My everything.
