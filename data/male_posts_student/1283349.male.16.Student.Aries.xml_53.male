I'm over at Brian's place, with Joe, playing Magic. Damn, those guys have an assload of cards. I mean, it dwarfs my own collection of (maybe) 1000 cards or so. Sure, 1000 cards might be nice, but that's not taking into consideration the fact that 99.9% of them suck. Majorly. In fact, they defy physics by both sucking AND blowing.  I always get so depressed thinking about how meager my Magic decks are. I mean, hardly a cohesive strategy in the lot. I'm looking at both Brian and Joe's binders of cards, and whimpering with each page I turn. It's truly frightening, the array of madness that those two control.  In other news, I've been  slacking off something fierce at school, yet still maintaining good grades. With my luck, that strategy will last for about 5 more minutes. Still making time for Imperian, of course. The Rasca-naut romps about the realm for about 2 or 3 hours a day, and this pleaseth the Caleb. Though if it were up to me, I'd take the two classes I enjoy at school, go home, and play God in Imperian the rest of the day (with healthy doses of RPGing and Mt:Ging in the evening, with this sorry lot of geeks [read: awesome d00ds])  "Any words from the rabble while I'm up on my internet soapbox?" I ask them.  "Tell them, 'Tear my life to pieces, this is my last resort.'" Joe merely chuckles and repeats Brian's punchline. Oh, that Joe.  "Joe, speak to the people." says I.  "Greetings, fools. It is I. The Guy. I have come to tell you... that burying dead hookers in the middle of the Nevada Desert is a bad idea." says  he. I shake my head and type willingly, disapproving all the while. Oh, that Joe. He is ever so silly.  -Squirrel, signing out  PS: I saw a badass bumper sticker, saying, "I talk with the squirrels. Ch-koo! Ch-koo!"
