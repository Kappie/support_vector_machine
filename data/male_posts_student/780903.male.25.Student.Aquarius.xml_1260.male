They traded their top pitching prospect (Scott Kazmir), their top hitting prospect (Justin Huber), a solid utility infielder (Ty Wigginton), a solid pitching prospect (Matt Peterson), and some guy I never heard of but based on the rest of this is probably the next Roger Clemens (Jose Diaz) for Kris Benson and Victor Zambrano, who are just not that good.  It is mind-boggling why the Mets would do this.  Mind-boggling.  It would be like trading your three-year-old child for a parakeet.  It doesn't make any sense.  So I'm now taking suggestions on what team to root for instead, because I'm not watching any more Mets games.  I want a team with upside.  The Padres are my first thought.  Maybe the Twins or the Indians.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Tell me why I should join your bandwagon.  Really, I'm shopping for a new team.  Heck, it doesn't even need to be a baseball team.  I'll root for the Liberty instead.  The Mets don't deserve to win another game, ever.
