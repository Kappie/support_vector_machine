Means I'll probably end up back at Center on Halsted.  I want to see Alex again before I leave, and get some way of contacting him.  Back to the present.  Saw dodgeball today.  Excellent movie.  I'd higly reccomend seeing it.  It's self-conciously stupid funny.  Time for tonights emo portion: My house sucks right now.  Looks my parents relationship is at the breaking point.  I talked to them last night.  Told them that I couldn't take the fighting, the house shaking, the screaming, the door slamming, etc. anymore.  So they had to do something or get over it.  Looks like they're doing something.  So in a roundabout way, I may have inadvertently kicked my dad out of my house.  He deserves it.  Cheating bastard.  There is nothing unclear about his situation.  Everything that's happened is his fault.  If he can't respect 30 something years of marriage, he doesn't deserve to be here.  He's a fucking bastard.  No wonder my mom is unable to forgive him.  In addition to all of that, I'm starting to feel like a pariah whenever I'm with my friends.  I get this vibe that nobody likes me.  It's really irritating, and this sounds like I'm fishing for compliments.  It's a shitty feeling.  I feel like I'm being put up with out of necessity.  I think that's why I enjoyed last night so much.  It made me feel like people were being genuinely nice.  I felt like I finally fit in.  Everything felt normal.  I can't wait to go back.  -Mike  "I can't get to sleep, think about the implications. of diving in too deep. and possibly the complications. especially at night, I worry over situations. I know we'll be allright, perhaps it's just imagination."
