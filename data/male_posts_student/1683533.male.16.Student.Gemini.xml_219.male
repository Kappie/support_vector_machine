NOFX  will be on Conan O'Brien, which is at 12:30 am on channel 4 NBC....wait...I guess that counts as tomorrow because it's after 12.  Yea that's right.  They will help promote  Rock Against Bush vol 2  which coincidentally comes out on the very same day....hmm...  I ripped half my finger nail off my index finger...its all bloody and yucky. >_  The new Green Day   urlLink site  should be running soon, today is the day its supposed to be changed. So, look for that.  I'm gonna drink some water then go to bed, nite nite.
