It was a big cock up too: disallowing a goal comes right alongside giving penalties as 'things not to do unless you are absolutely bloody certain'.  But death threats?!  IT'S A GAME  So is tennis.  The Sun's headline was worrying.  'Guilty', with mugshots of Henman, Beckham and a couple of others (I think representatives of the cricket and rugby teams).  Guilty of what?  Guilty of being the best we have, or had.  When The Sun finally realises that Henman is not going to win Wimbledon, and England is not going to win Euro 2004, they need to blame someone.  The referee was easy and even justified.  But that didn't go far enough.  So, they attack the players who they have over-hyped the most.  By putting all the pressure on them, and making the nation believe that they really can win, they do not just say that they made a good effort but were beaten by a better team/man.  They have to come up with headlines like 'guilty'.  Apparently Beckham isn't up to it now, it's his fault that we lost.  Hang on, wouldn't we have won without that dodgy decision?  So surely Beckham is up to it?  And what about Rooney?  When he went off injured, the commentator said something along the lines of England being screwed.  Sorry to be blunt, but if the team is relying on a single 18-year-old to win, I'm afraid the team isn't really up to it.
