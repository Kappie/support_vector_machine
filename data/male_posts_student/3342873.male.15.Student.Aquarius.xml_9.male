In fact, they're so "not bad" that it is enitirely feasible to continue on with what I was. In other words, I'll probably finish my Masters. Damn, here I was thinking I should get a job and start making good money. Another dream down the toilet as it were. For now, anyway. To be rather blunt, to not continue now, would be plain stupidity. It might not be what I want to do, but giving it up now, would mean I wasted 6 months for nothing. Might as well take another year, and be called master for the rest of life. Until I get my PHD ofcourse. *sigh* Life really does trip you up, and maybe, this, as previously thought, might not be the worst thing. In fact, it might turn out to be the best. But I can't help feeling dissapointed, that another opportunity for change, is gone. Ah well, such is life, I'll just it back and enjoy it. What else can I do?
