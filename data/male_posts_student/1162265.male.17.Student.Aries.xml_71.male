I'll be writting more then just this entry into  The Dialogue of Thomas with the Savior :   The Great Teacher, spoke to me one day as we were fishing.  "Thomas," said the Savior "Why do you want to worship me?" I looked at the Lord confused, for I had long prayed in his name.  "But Lord, did you not say you were the son of God?" I asked him, quite confused.  The lord then spoke thus unto me, having great annoyance.  "Your ears hear, but your soul does not listen.  First man worshipped statues, but then they found the Father.  Then they found me, and started to call me the Statue, but now I've passes the statue into you."  I sat in silence, staring out across the sea, before I asked the Lord, "Rabbi, what do you mean?  Isn't it said not to worship statues and treat them such as you?".  The lord answered, "But you have no need for idols, you see them as false.  It took me to make you realize that the blood burned in the temple is given to one who is fake.  Now people worship me, but I come to say that you are the one to be worshipped for you have been had the Divine Wisdom (Gnosis) delivered unto you."  I continued to fish, not fully understanding all the words that the Lord had said.  "But Lord, who are you then to me if I am already worthy of praise?"  The Lord moved away from me, but before he left, I heard him say "You have drank from my mouth, and become such as me.  You have no need to worship your equal, for you already have seen God, and God has already seen you.  So who are you praying to?"  With that the Lord was gone, and I sat thinking over these things all the days of my life until I ruled over all I saw.   Okay now that that is done..... I kind of have stayed away from politics recently, although now I've been slipping back into Maoism a bit.  The soft-core type, like the Black Panthers followed, not like Chairman Mao, hard-core pure Maoism.  I don't know why, because I'm a pacifist, but it's hard core stuff.  Next on the order of business.  I really just need to say this in a more open method so it's no longer bottled up.  Why oh why do people throw around the term "anti-semite" so much..... If I was anti-anything I guess I'd be anti-facist, but I do have a strong dislike of Zionism, does that make me an anti-semite?  Apparently......Whatever, everyone instinctively is defensive of their own race.  So I guess it's understandable.  Wow, already feel better, don't have to have this rant evolve.
