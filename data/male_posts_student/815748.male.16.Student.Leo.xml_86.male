I was saying how the beginning of the plaintiff closing was a little corny, so Martin made up the following alternative on the spot:  "Imagine a little boy wakes up on Christmas morning.  He finds a brand-new bike under the Christmas tree.  But it isn't finished, he has to put it together.  So, after three long hours of assembling it, it's finally all built, but there's one piece missing: the handlebars.  That's because another kid stole them because his dad told him to.  Your Honor, Jody Sarak is that little boy, and Professor Chervy is the dad.  Thank you."  Mock Trials is all that's been happening lately.  Everyone always IMs me asking if anything happened, and I give them the same answer.  I just don't know what to do, but for some reason I don't really care as much anymore.  There's all this stuff hanging over my head, mainly the year-long history project and the test on Wednesday.  Oh, and you might have noticed that I've been saying "htg" instead of "gtg."  This is not a typo.  I don't like how people say "got" instead of "have," so I've decided to do my part to change things around.  We'll see how that goes.  I wrote my Julien-Legrain redaction.  I'm not going to post it, at least until after both sections turn them in, to avoid plagiarism, but here's what happens: Julien and Legrain argue over Jews and Communism, then this American guy comes and starts arguing about how the US saved the French and the Resistance didn't do anything.  I don't know, I guess you have to read it to find it funny.  Then again, it isn't funny.  Eh.  I figured I couldn't end on an "eh," so I'll post the lyrics to the song that's playing so you can sing along.  If it's already finished by now, just refresh the window, or tell me if I should make it loop.  "So I Fall Again" by Phantom Planet (the same band as the one that wrote The OC's theme song)  I can't say if this feeling coming over me is real, But I know it's something you can't steal, So I'll buy another problem to approach,  Sell a virgin lie that can't be touched.  [Chorus:] So I fall again, So I fall again, So I break through this rotten piece of wood, Again.  I can't say if this here f*cking subject should be dropped, But I know it's something you can't stop, So I'll buy another pick-up line and sigh, And pretend that everything is alright.  [Chorus]
