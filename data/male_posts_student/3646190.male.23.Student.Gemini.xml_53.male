I just think I owe her a response the comment she put up, especially after I asked for some feedback.  I think she hits the point that most men are not comfortable with women who have strong personalities and character. I would argue that is mostly due to society and the way patriarchy functions in this world. The systemic problem of patriarchy can only be tackled by struggle in a manner that tackles the issue head on. Of course there have been many instances in history when the equality of women has been proven in struggles that are not against patriarchy per se. For example when women in strikes are just as militant as men and they break the perception that women cannot be equals with men in militant actions. The same can be said in the academic world—in our classroom settings, but the problem with the academic world is that it is relegated to words and people are not always moved/ their perception of reality is not always moved by a strong argument or a great mid-term paper. Nothing changes men’s perceptions and women’s perceptions of themselves like actually being involved in some sort of struggle when they can actually feel empowered and take control of their own lives.  A comment Anon 1 made that left me a little confused was: “Also it is not haram for men to see women otherwise there would be no need for hijab.(Honestly what are you gonna wear a hijab for? To cover from the walls in your home?)”  So do you think women should wear the hijab?  From my perspective I believe women have the right to wear the hijab, but the hijab should not be the measure of their piety. In that same line of thought, neither should whether a woman wears jeans, shorts, or a skirt be a measure of her religious dedication. I would argue there are a lot of other ways to measure someone’s commitment to religion and God. Of course in our society the only way a women can prove her worth is by covering her body, then she is falling the word of God. So again the battle field becomes the women’s body and her appearance which I do not agree with.  I really have not thought about whether the woman’s actions were productive or not. To me it seemed they were and were rather appropriate. But Anon 1 raises a good point on how to conduct yourself when doing things against the grain. I think that will require some more thought on my part. Off the top of my head, I don’t think that she should conform to any standard of clothing and should stick to what ever makes her feel comfortable.
