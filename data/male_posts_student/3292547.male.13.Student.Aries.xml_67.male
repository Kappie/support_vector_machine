Unlike the last time, it only took 10 minutes to pick out the frames.   As I said, not much going on. I don't have anything really to tell you except that the part holding my ceiling fan up had broken and my fan was only being held up by a piece of metal, but I saw it in time. No worries. Well. That's all. I'm still thinking about which of the templates I should choose. I've decided to choose bye August because that's when school starts (or did I already say that)   Well. See ya. I'll tell you when I get my new lenses and frames.
