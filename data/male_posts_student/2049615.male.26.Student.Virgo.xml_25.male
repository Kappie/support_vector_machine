Yesterday, for dinner, at around 7:30 pm, I went to Bloomington's own hippie money pit, the  urlLink Jungle Room , located conveniently inside local Trustafarian swill hole Uncle Fester's.  I was intending to get the salad bar, because it's all I could really afford, as I was going to a concert later on, about which more later.  I walked in the front and seated myself, according to Jungle Room protocol.  I sat reading my newly-obtained copy of  Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum  for a few minutes before wondering when I could get my order taken.  The restaurant was most decidedly not busy;  at the time I was the only person in my section, and the majority of the clientele were only there for drinks.  Yes.  At twenty to eight on a Wednesday night, the majority of the clientele were only there for drinks.  In the succeeding few minutes, I would come into view of fully two waitresses, neither of whom could apparently be bothered.  Like I said, all I wanted was the salad bar, so I started to get up and head to the front to just ask to go to the fucking salad bar, please.  At that exact moment some goon from the kitchen walked over to the salad bar and started shutting it down.  Keep in mind that this place is supposed to be open until like three in the morning.  Another thing to bear in mind is that this is the second time that I have been ignored by the worthless trust fund cracker bitch idiots that loaf around that place for more than twenty minutes.  I kept going because it's the only place in Bloomington you can eat vegan for under seven dollars.  As for now, fuck it.  But my odyssey of invisibility does not end there.   urlLink Need New Body  and  urlLink Azita  were reputed by Bloomington's famously vague concert flyers to be playing that night at the  urlLink Second Story .  A flyer-finding expedition, which led me at roughly 9 pm to the doors of the Second Story itself revealed that the doors were to open at 10.  What that flyer also revealed, which I would have done well to heed, was that in addition to the two groups I wanted to see, I would also be treated to the local whiteboy backpack hip-hop sounds of Acebestis.  Returning to the venue at 10, I could see that a long wait was in order.  The degree of onstage fuckaround indicated that the opening band had a lot of shit to fuck around with before they took their half-hour pre-show ganja break.  During this time, I became thirsty.  I went up to the bar, where the bartender, complete with corkscrew permanent and skintight black t-shirt, was evidently involved in a complex discussion of tropical vacations with three idle, superfluous waitresses.  I waited up there for a while, got discouraged, and sat back down.  Later, as the band hadn't yet started and I was now  really  thirsty, I went back up.  Then I sat back down.  Finally, shortly before Acebestis began to pollute the air with their total shitstain of an act, I saw my opening:  there were no tits at the bar with which I would have to compete for the bartender's attention.  I got my water and tipped the asshole a dollar.  You're welcome, asshole.  I had my bookbag with me, and as I sat sipping my water, I tried to read a litte, but the bar was too dark.  I would have to spend the rest of the time before the show with my own thoughts, which, on perusal of this website, you can see are not all that positive.  Mercifully, it was now not long before the show.  Unmercifully, the show was Acebestis.  I proceed first from politeness:  The first few backing tracks that Acebestis used (Bestis, evidently is the DJ, while Ace is the MC) were not bad.  They were fairly decent slices of Dust Brothers/Beastie Boys 70's funk-soul sound collage.  Unfortunately, after that they had to go and get original, and really really bad.  Then there's Ace.  Ace is quite possibly the worst MC ever.  His lyrics are insipid and his flow is nonexistent.  I would like to go out on a very short, very thick limb, one which is very close to the ground, if not actually resting upon it, and suggest that Ace's primary influences as an MC are, in ascending order of importance:  M-1, MC Paul Barman, Del the Funkee Homosapien, Digable Planets, and Kool Keith. Except that most of those people are actually good.  Ace's stilted whiteboy diction fused not at all with his failed attempts at rapping with big words about positivity and social justice, and his obnoxious attempts at introducing poetry-slam-style melismatics and syncopation into his delivery made me want to throw an ashtray at his fucking head, a head which, I might add, sported a back-length growth of hair which he had secured into a samurai-style topknot protruding not from the top of his head, but from about 2 o'clock, if you were to look at him face-on.  Coupled with his starter 'stache and dork glasses, his overall physical impression is that of a backpack Weird Al Yankovic.  Shortly after the beginning of their set Azita, apparently asleep in the back of the bar, woke up and left the room.  I can't blame her.  I myself went down to the street and frantically dialed through my cellphone's address book, killing time before they would just fucking  stop  already in the guise of playing catch-up with friends.  Don't worry, I apprised my friends of their role in the transaction.  Finally they finished and Azita came on.  Her solo stuff, which I had not heard before, is markedly different from her earlier output with  urlLink Scissor Girls .  Whereas that group was largely about DNA-inspired skronk rock whose closest contemporary analogue is probably Erase Errata, Azita solo, if I may continue to play the "sounds like" game, is mining a vein typically visited by Pleasure Forever, Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Marianne Faithfull, and other such  maudits nouveaux .  The Marianne Faithfull resemblance is particularly marked in the vocals.  At times the theatricality of the performance veered into schmaltz, but not for long, and the songs all had an affecting cabaret quality, which probably excuses much of the aforementioned schmaltz as just a precondition of the genre.  I'd like finish up by telling you how the Need New Body performance was, but I can't.  They didn't start until 1:30 in the fucking morning, which is all well and good if you're some Southern Indiana alcoholic layabout who gets drunk on Wednesday afternoon and cuts class whenever the fuck he feels like, but unfortunately I'm not, and I had class in the morning.  I stayed for as long as I could, but they wasted about twenty minutes draping the stage in lam√© and so I only got to hear the first two minutes of the first song.  Which, by the way, was a bunch of jerkoff.  Remember  urlLink Bent Leg Fatima ?  I do - they were fucking  good .  Why can't we have them back?  And the first NNB album wasn't too bad either.  Maybe a little overindulgent in parts, but solid;  back then those guys could tell the difference between experimentation and fucking around.  Then again, maybe this is just pissiness because, at 1:30 in the morning, not having eaten since noon, I wasn't in the mood to have to listen to some dude shrieking "I'm building a hogan!" (or something) again and again and again and again and again.
