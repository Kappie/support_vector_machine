Moreover, I nearly bought a mobile phone while waiting for the bus from Carphone Warehouse, and the salesman, Anas Patel, himself looked at me like I was crazy, because I clearly thought £19.95 and £15/month was nothing. Have resolved to go back again tomorrow after thinking it over, but the bus fare to town is £1.  After my earlier victory in eating those genuine pork pies (Aussie pork pie manufacturers: the jelly is supposed to hold the pork and crust together, not constitute a liquid layer between the two), I went and got a genuine Gregg’s cheese pastie.  Lancaster makes me realise that in fact England has changed very little. Thus far, other than a couple of seemingly random price hikes, the changes appear to amount to:  The Independent and The Times have now adopted the tabloid format (NB they adopted the content years ago), leaving only two national broadsheets, The Grauniad and The Torygraph; Abbey National is now called ‘abbey’; aforementioned crazy travel advice console, which gave me ultimately useless directions to the bus stop in Lancaster, thanks fuckwit . . .; polyphonic ringtones; and it seems Deutsche Telekom has become one of the main UK mobile networks – thinking about it, it must have replaced BT Cellnet, a terrible network which I had forgotten about.  It seems it is me who has changed. In particular, note my consternation at how men all still shave their heads here. I mean, I thought everyone had just grown out of it, but in fact, I now realise, I have just become Australianised! When I arrived in Australia, shaven-headed, everyone else there was wearing hair. Then I thought, how fucking backward, but at some point I started thinking that they were being fashionable, when they were actually just lagging decades behind. Fuck it though – I’m keeping my Newtown mullet!
