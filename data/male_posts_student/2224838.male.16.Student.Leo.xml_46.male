The school board has banned Washburn University recruiters from visiting Wichita schools due to the controversy surrounding  urlLink this statue . Is it really anti-Catholic? I admit, it's not a very flattering statue for this particular bishop, but I don't think it's trying to attack Catholicism. It's all in the eye of the beholder, just as  The Passion of the Christ .   urlLink Schools' ban on Washburn affects little
