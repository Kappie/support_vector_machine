My brothers friends are still here, but every female that was in this house tonight has gone, so I decided I'd go to bed instead of watching "Half Baked" with my brother and his friends. "Two Finger" brand Tequilla is bad for you. Half of my shot ended up being sprayed accross the kitchen, in the same effect as that infamous video clip of urine being ejected from a spaceship, spewing in a beautiful spray inot the great beyone. Except my tequilla landed on Kendra.  Meh.
