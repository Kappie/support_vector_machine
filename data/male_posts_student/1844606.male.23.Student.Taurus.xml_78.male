Hatch of Utah has introduced a bill saying that Presidential canidates  don't  have to be born in the United States to become, well, President. -this is a big jump, but using California as the template, how great would it be if that bill goes through, and some how, 34 states think this is a good idea. -then we have someone from oh I don't know, pick any nation in the world that hates us. -someone decides to run -gets elected -desolves the gov't   far fetched, but keep in mind the Cubs, Red Sox and Blackhawks won tonight.  Oh and there's a full moon.
