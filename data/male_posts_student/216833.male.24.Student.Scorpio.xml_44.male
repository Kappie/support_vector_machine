The fat fucks eating more cake then they should, not even really knowing whose birthday it is, they are everywhere when the song is being farted out of fellow employee.  What is up with "CUBE DECORATIONS!"  Seems bizarre to decorate a fucking cube.  I dunno, thats just me, but I don't want "over the hill" or "streamers" or "midgits with ribbons" distracting me from my work.  I got enough distractions already.  Although the midgits might be cool to have around for coffee and such!  Small people RULE!
