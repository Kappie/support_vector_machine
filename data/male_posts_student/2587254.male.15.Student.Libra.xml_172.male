Filled with fellowship, worship practice, and just chillin' with the rest of the HYPE kids. Even though some of them are studying their minds out...there were still a few of them that came to the meeting at my place tonight. Hmm.....as for the rest of my day...  I awoke around 930 today to start my weekend. Now I had to be at the church by 10am to do worship practice w/ Gavin and Carmen, so yeah I had 15 minutes to get ready then bolt out the door. so breakfast, teeth brush, washed face, got dressed, then headed out.  Go to church around 10am...whoo on time! So we started rehearsal right away, yeah sorta skipped prayer....but oh well it's over with now. So this week's theme was on the 2nd coming of Christ, so songs were HARD to choose for this week....VERY HARD. Eventually we got through though. Songs we picked this time contrast in tempo a lot...two jamming songs and then two slower songs, and another one. I like response song this week though. It's the one that's titled "I Can Only Imagine." I think it's awesome song. Oh yeah...then me and Gavin had this inside joke going. Carmen was singing pretty quietly, so Gavin kinda died out from singing, and then I was saying how it sounded like all of a sudden only drums could be heard, so then Gavin made this 1 man Jam...argh too bad I can't show over blog, but it was funny haha. Practice went by pretty quick...and 12pm came just on time...like usual. I wonder why =P...  So getting home...just sat around for a bit before Josh and Lina came over to study for bio. Yeah....Josh surprisingly doesn't know a whole lot lol.   "Uhh...guys is X the boy?"   Oh but one of the funnier ones...   "Ok Josh what's external respiration?" *Josh inhales and exhales*   He did the same for internal also and cellular...but with some hand clapping haha. It was pretty fun time studying...some jokes and some knowledge crammed into head. Hmm....so yeah 3pm...Lina had to go back home, and Wenders and Ken came over for prestudy before HYPE tonight. So yeah my house has been the centre of events today =P.  Prestudy went fairly well. ME AND JOSH LED STUDY TODAY! Well....did the main leading w/ help from Wendy and Ken. It was fun =P. So we did prestudy, then ordered pizza. Mmm.....pizza ^_^. So good. Well actually Ken and JOsh went to his place to print off some handouts and then also went to pick up pizza. Wendy and I stayed at my place and looked at old pictures and stuff.  Hmm yeah...today would be the first time I had anchovies on pizza in my life. It tasted...well fishy. Oh yeah and REALLY salty. We all vowed to have a slice of anchovy pizza....BUT THEN WENDY BROKE HER VOW! Well sorta...she nibbled one anchovy and then left the rest to rot. The rest of us had two slices each. Pineapple, Mushroom and italian sausage was good though. Jason came early and got a slice too. Then Calvin and Becca came. Oh  yeah today Becca and Lina for some reason both used my printer to print stuff, as slow as it is. 'Cept even after I told them not to use black ink...THEY DO ANYWAYS. So yeah they had to REPRINT EVERYTHING and wasted over 20 sheets of paper. Ugh....smart people *not*...  So then HYPE started. Only Steph, Gavin, Calvin, Becca, Jason and Brian showed up today. Plus Josh and counselors. So yeah leading was pretty fun today. First time in my life actually doing it semi independent...it was cool =P. I could delegate people to do things haha =P. It kinda reminded me of back when I was little using training wheels on a bike...I sorta got the hang of riding the bike but still had help. Actually more like riding a bike with training wheels and a rollcage....I could still fall probably...but if I would have fallen the rollcage would protect me =P. Point was it was fun...and educational. Now I know how hard it is to teach things haha.  Then after HYPE...ate food and then most of the guys went to ball. I was kinda lazy so chatted w/ Wendy, Becca and Steph 'bout a whole bunch of random things. From Troy to whether I could cut Rebecca's hair; but I'd have to shave my legs for the price...yeah the whole potpourri of stuff. It was pretty funny though...Wendy started complaining about how Hector in Troy was missing a teeth...I was surprised she could notice that lol. It reminded me of the time when Adrian pointed out that Trinity used Linux to hack into the power grid....OI how the heck can you notice that?! Yeah we also had some laughs...HYPE was pretty funny tonight. Oh yeah and also Wendy was saying how she was getting fat even though she's as skinny as Steph, and then me and Becca had convo about Spoonfaces and Girlie shorts...yup.....very spirited convos.  Yeah so after hearing ehough of their talk, I finally went outside and played some ball. Hard to see a black basketball at night. Anyways played American...Calvin won, then Jason, and then yeah they all had to go.  And here I am now working on tomorrow's slide show and finishing up blog....and MSNing. Well I'm out. Later.
