Ummm...how bout' a random story of the day!      So, this guy goes to Taco bell to get a burrito and a large Coke.  Just then, a spaceship abducts him and anal probes him (like all aliens do).  The guy, let's call him Pedro, wakes up in the middle of a corn field.  Pedro looks around and sees three Buildings.  He figures he could get a ride or call for some help (he's done this before).  He goes up to the first house and nocks on the door.  The door opens and an Amish man and woman come out come out.  Pedro apologizes for interrupting them and asks if he can use a phone.  The Man looks at his wife and says to Pedro, "I'm sorry sir; we don't take kindly to telecommunications".  Pedro shrugs and thanks the Amish couple anyway.  Pedro stumbles a bit off the steps but he catches himself from falling on the cobble stone path.  Pedro rings the bell on the second house.  A child comes out and hugs Pedro's leg, "Daddy!  Your home!".  Pedro figures since its dark that the child can't tell who he was.  Pedro slurs and says, "I'mmm mot your fawthe'".  The boy let's go of his leg and runs into the house and locks the doors.  Pedro hears, "MOMMY!  DADDY'S DRUNK AGAIN!!!!".  Pedro shrugs and stumbles to the next building witch was the local bar.  When he walks in a man says, "Pedro!  We thought you'd never come back!  Man you were so drunk!  We'd thought you'd never stop throwing up!".       Ok, e-mail me to tell me how bad that was.  Keep in mind i just made it up.
