Then I gotta work on a research paper. Then I gotta get some sleep! It's already 12:30 in the morning! Why don't I do these things during the day? Oh well. Always something to watch or somewhere to go instead. Always another errand to run that could wait until tomorrow but probably shouldn't. Always have to get up and use the bathroom or get a snack or some water. Hey, I could go for some water right now. Awful hot day, it was. Water would be nice. Hey, one minute left! I'll spend it going to the kitchen sink.
