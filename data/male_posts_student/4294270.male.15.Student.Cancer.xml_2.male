We talked for a while, laughed at idiots and then I left her to socialize with her friends who are still in their little superficial bubble ( they don't realize there's no point in trying ). I just realized, I'm usually not this way in real life :-p. So I guess you guys get the pleasure in seeing behind the mask. Back to last night... Cassy and me stayed up 'til around 3:40 am or so [ yes staying up late runs in the family, once again minus the old, stupid/arrogant father ]. We had crystal light and home made egg mcmuffins [ much to my delite ]. Anyways I woke up today and went back to sleep [ finally dragging my sorry ass out of bed around 1:30 ]. I had a shower and did the usual routine of getting up for the day [ hygiene is important, more people  should  use deoderant ]. I see that many other people on here have pictures of themselves, I know it's bad to conform but I wanted a picture none the less. So I tried taking some, much to my dismay I see that my photogenicness has died [ along with my beloved labtop power supply ]. Well anyways after an hour and a half of mindnumbing television I am here now. I'm going to go entertain myself and try to convince myself I shouldn't care about my looks. Ciao.
