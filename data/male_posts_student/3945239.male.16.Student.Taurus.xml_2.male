There isn't much going on besides the excitement for Otakon. So I'm just getting this updated, so the no one that reads it can't say I don't update. XP Wow. Writing to no one. It's weird, writing like this- to no one as if I am talking to someone- is strangely relaxing. Even when it's about nothing. Weird.
