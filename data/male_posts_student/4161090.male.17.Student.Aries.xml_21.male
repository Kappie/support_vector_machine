And we men are but god’s fantasy? Even god may be blinded from the truth For falsehood seeps in everywhere And when vortexes throw their shadows And demons walk the mind’s lair  And even lightning gets smothered out By the cracks of harmless sanity And the mind, a lost child, is reared By the wolves of fate howling silently And if you’ve read this thing through Don’t let it burden your intellect Just write any old CRYPTIC NONSENSE And suddenly you’re an insightful poet ;) -Aditya MJ SYJC D
