Isn't that what friends are for?  We're the insect life of Paradise: Crawl across leaf or among Towering blades of grass -  Glimpse only sometimes the Amazing breadth of heaven    You're as loved as you were Before the strangeness swept Through our bodies, Our Houses, Our streets - When we could speak without Codes  And light swirled around, like Wind blown petals, Our feet   I've been scraping Little shavings off my Ration of light And I formed it into a Ball, and each time I Pack a bit more on To it I make a bowl of my hands and I Scoop it from its secret cache Under a loose board in the Floor And I blow across it and I send It to you Against those moments when The darkness blows under your Door   Isn't that what friends are for? Isn't that what friends are for? Isn't that what friends are for?

The beast was said to be "probably quite traumatised" by the journey cooped up in the back of the vehicle and is being cared for at a sanctuary.   'Probably - Probably Not: Who knows? Quite - Tell me, on a scale from 1 to ten. Trauma specialist are working around the clock to restore stability into the shocked beast.  SSPCA spokeswoman Mairi Ball said: "These alligators will attack anyone, they have big teeth and can grow up to three metres long."    'They have BIG TEETH! Stop the Press. What else? They eat babies, if dangled above their mouths. NO. Possibly, quite probably, maybe, if only by chance, perhaps perhaps perhaps...   Tinkered with an article from the Guardian.
