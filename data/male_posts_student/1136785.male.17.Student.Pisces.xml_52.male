He will be very tired and will have traveled all day.  He is actually beginning to feel a mixture of sadness and blind rage at leaving, among other things best not discussed.  If there is no banner nor some sort of altar with votive candles set up waiting for him, he will be severly disappointed in you all.  He has missed you all a great deal, and is excited to see you all again, and to leave some of the bullshit here far far far behind.  He is also now the proud owner of his very own Hookah.  That is all.
