(I casually point in that direction.)   C :Yeah, all I saw are those pink and gray ones.  M :Yes, those are what we carry.  C :But I bought these longer bendy ones here before.  M :How long ago?  C :About three months ago I guess.  M :Ah, those were a summer item, we're out of stock on those.  (Now there really are summer items we only carry at the beginning of summer, and once we sell them there are gone.  But I have no idea what he is talking about,  lately I've been using this excuse on items I'm not familiar with.)    C :Okay, so where are they?  Me :Well, we're sold out, we don't have anymore.  C :So you don't have any around the store?  M :No.    Keep in mind that this stuff happens all day long at the store.  People ask questions about stock, prices, directions, and then they don't listen.  The other day a Lady asked me how to get to the checkouts.  I started to tell her to go straight ahead, turn left down the main isle and she would see them.  Before I even told her to take a left she raised her hands in despair as if I was assaulting her with an overload of information.  So I just pointed in the directions and said "That way."  She took ten steps, turn back towards me, and said "This Way?"  I nodded yes.  Then another ten steps, "Am I going in the right direction?"  As I turned around to tell her she had to keep going, I noticed she was standing under a very large sign (I think the letters alone are over a foot tall), with an arrow pointing ahead saying CHECKOUT.
