We are going to the Yishun doctor (I am not seeing him. My mother is. I am only accompnaying). Father's fetching us at 8, so I gotta bath quick. I bathed and came online for awhile. Heh.   Yeah. Dad called at 8. I brought mah book, Witch Week, along to read. Yeah. We ate kueh chap for breakfast, then we went to the doctor lor. I sat in the car (air-conditioned. And yes, I did open the windows. I am not gonna CO myself to death) to read while waiting for Mother to be done with the doctor. Meow moo. Mother brought Mentos, so I was reading and eating and listening to the radio.   After the visit to the doctors, I went back while parents went to Sheng Shiong. There, I spent my time snapping up questions for DADA. Heh Heh. Wendy called and asked if she can come over. I was like "sure". However, soon after, Mother called and told me that Grandmother is in the Tan Tock Seng hospital and we have to go see her after they come back from Sheng Shiong. I tried to call Wendy, but she can't listen. I only managed to call her when she's in the lift up... So paiseh. Sorry leh Wendy (I know you said "it's okay" lotsa times, but yeah...).  Hmm. Finding a parking spot during visiting hour is a trouble, especially at the beginning of the visiting hours. Nobody's gonna come down to drive out. After several rounds of driving round and round, we found a spot. Meow! When we entered the lift lobby, our temperatures were taken and we were given a green sticker. Then, we have to go up to Level 1 to register ourselves (we have to bring our ICs).   After all that trouble, we went up to Level 5, Ward 5A. In the lobby were Dai Gu Ma, another auntie (forgot name le) and Felicia. Felicia came to visit Grandmother during her lunch break (she is working in the UOB bank, which is very near TTSH). It looks like Grandmum got diabetes and is unable to walk. Anyway, she was out having an x-ray done, so we were like waiting for ages. They talked about a lot of things, like how Grandmother don't want her house cleanse. She said to have seen a shadow of a female ghost. Everybody's asking her to clean the room, but she is having none of it. Oh well. Cleaning a room is very easy, by the way.   It was 1 and she's still not back yet. Felicia has to go back to work (lunch break's over. Poor thing. I don't think she has lunch yet), but she said she will be coming at night. Well, the nursing staff said we could visit her past visitng hours (because we were waiting for an hour for nothing). A short while later, she came back, but we aren't allowed to see her yet. The nurses are cleaning her, and I think, diluting her blood. Her blood became so thick that it won't run smoothly. It stretched for about 45 minutes. We had to go back (Mother's gotta work), so we went in to have a look at her lor. She was quite pale. Sigh. I hope she gets well soon.  Hmm. We went to AMK Central to have lunch, then came back lor. Father didn't want to work anymore, so he's cleaning the floor (we clean the floor every Mon and Fri). I wanna clean the kitchen later. Heh. Now I blog.   Hmm. When I was out, I was busy smsing Amanda, Wendy and WQ. Me and Amanda were chatting perfectly la. Somehow, WQ and Wendy stopped replying to my sms and din't even take my calls. I was like "oh shit". What if they ignored me because I sent too many SMSes and pissed them off? If they do that, I will be terribly lonely. I am just plain crazy today, so paranoid! It turns out that WQ didn't hear my calls and SMSes. Okay, phew. I think Wendy just wants to be alone (or is talking to another cat), so yeah. I stopped calling le lor. Meow moo.   Okay. I've been wanting to talk about beer ads for ages, but I forgot to mention them. See ar. These are misleading! There are a lot of beer ads that have pictures of successful men or brave men, with words like "you can be the same". THESE ARE TERRIBLY MISLEADING! How can you be successful if you drink beer? How can you be brave/strong if you drink beer? It doesn't make sense! The ads give people FALSE HOPES! Stupid right? I remember it was a Wedesday (the Wed when Dad collects his taxi), when we are eating breakfast. The posters were besides me. I got so terribly irked by the false messages that I commented about them throughout the whole breakfast. My parents, of course, did not say anything, because they were used to me doing that. BEER ADS ARE MISLEADING!   EDIT: Yesterday night I watched Moulin Rouge! OH MY GOD! It's such a wonderful show! It's romantic, it's touching, it feels so real! The love story of Christian and Satine, spoilt by the evil, unscruplous Duke! I felt so touched! Satine suffered a terrible fate! So sad! I wanna buy the VCD!! The soundtrack too! So many nice songs! Especially 'Roxanne' and 'Come What May'! Meow!!  Er hm. I think I end le la. It's my turn to mop the kitchen floor soon. See ya tomorrow. TaTa.
