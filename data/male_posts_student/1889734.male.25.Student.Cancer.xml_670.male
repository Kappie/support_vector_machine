I love the chippiness at the end - it seems contrary, perhaps, but I do...as long as it aint dirty like stickwork.   But again, the inconsistent calls - from game to game mostly.  Within this game it was fine.  But each period there was a call in the first minute.  The refs trying to set the tone?    I don't know...  Did ya'll see that play by Lecavelier, off the back of the net?  He shoulda stuffed it home right there, but I bet he was too surprised that it worked!
