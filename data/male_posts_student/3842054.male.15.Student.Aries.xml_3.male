My close friends know that Ricky was like one of my biggest role models, and now hes gone. What a great way to go. 27. In perfect shape. Ready to break out. Loved by Miami. Invested 3 first round draft picks into him. Molded an entire team around him. Gone. Like that. Gone to Asia to smoke marajuana. Bye Bye Ricky. that part of my life is over... GO DOLPHINS!!!    So i did chores today. Made some more money. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. NOTHING HAPPENED TODAY!!!!! YEAH!!!!!!     Alright, im bored... Um, ALRIGHT NEW THING!!! In like 7th grade, i got this book from my grandpa titled "How to Be a Gentleman" Its pretty cool. Im going to post one quote from it on every post. Kind of as a joke. But w/e.    "A gentleman always tucks his undershirt into his underwear."    17 DAYS TILL SCHOOL STARTS    Alrigt, i love this song. Here it is. If I feel like posting later, I will.     I wonder to round feed this bitterness   It's worth it, seen any of this   Love and forgiveness   Our time is and true   I know you're full of fear   I hope I'm never like you   I wander too and feel this hate   It's empty and doesn't change a thing   Love will endure when it comes to the end   I see you're insecure   I know there's hope for you      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man      I wonder to round feed hostility   It's pointless to dwell on my anger   Love is the answer innate as it seems   I know you're full of hate   I hope I'm never the same   I wonder too and fear this pain   Imagine the magnitude of   Love that is giving the chance to prevail   I see you're full of tears   And I can sense you're here      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man      Take what you want to   Now that you got the chance to   Take it, why don't you?   Now that you got the chance to [x2]      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man      Why can't I let go?   I'm only the shell of a man   I'm lost in myself   And afraid of who I really am   The shell of a man        I really love this song, and you could hear me comenting on it at a later time.
