It was fun but now i am sick from being outside in the pollen and being wet from the bachelor party [we played paint ball in the rain and we all got SOKED]. It was really fun though, and it hurt when you got hit! REALLY BAD! Thats the rush i guess.  * Well thats about it, I have to go to an interview for KILWINS to see if i get the job!   Stay Tuned   * KD
