They just left, and we can't find his cell phone.  Oh well, he was gonna switch his plan, anyway.   You know, I omit a LOT of things.  Some meaningless.  But when I just... introduce people, I feel as though I must explain.  Ooook, here we go.  Sonja:  My eldest sister.  Wesley + 10 in years, making her almost 26.    She did lab/research work in physiology and biophysics and got her masters a few months back in that field.  She now works in a genetics lab doing god knows what sort of managerial work/culture creations.  She lives with her fiance, Ryan and my brother Derek.  Sonja, in my opinion, is the embodiment of today's modern Western woman: paranoid, lippy, spends a lot, and overconcerned about her weight and fitness.  And money.  I don't know why she does kung fu.  She is also very, shall I say...... flirty?  Ryan:  Or should I say.... Poor Ryan.  He has ALmost finished med-school and is probably gonna go into pathology work (the discovery/treatment of disease, its isolated from people).  We call him Poor Ryan...... because he's with Sonja.  Jesus.  He has been under lots of school and private pressure now and deserves to sit in front of his new PS2.  Good for him, I like him.   He's the classic American Joe, hardworking, and loves sports and such and such, a classic guy.  Lets hope he can help Sonja not be a bitch.  He's been with her 7 years.  Oh, yeah, he's... 27.  Derek: My brother, you know him.  A pot smokin-kung fu doin-lazy-conspiracy spewing-mofo who likes to be violent.  I don't know what his problem is..... I guess its rooted at living with Sonja, hell, I'd be more violent too.  He's Wes + 4 years.  Also, he's dropped outta formal school and now pursues Eastern thought, and asskicking.  He's here in CB right now, because of the snow.  Eleanor:  My starving artist sister who got phi beta kappa a while ago.  She's a smart one, and knows how to handle money, which she learned from having a job.  She works at a known art gallery, Akar, in Iowa city.  She's got lots of art in her own gallery, as well.  I'm glad she's somewhat happy with Jessie.  Wes + 8 years.  Graduated college last year with honors.  Jessie: Eleanor's boyfriend of one year.  He is tall, skinny, and a workin-man.  He has been divorced once and is 28.  He was somewhat of a problem child but turned out ok.  He's a mechanic genius, and drives cabs (Lotsa money, 3 days = 600 bucks).  He hopes to take Eleanor to Florida sometime and get a degree in marine mechanics and build boats, which is really great.  He's got a great creative mind.    Gary:  My boss, whom I am close to hating.  Really, he is one of the two people I do NOT like at ALL.  I fake liking him and the storage unit job.  I'm just there for the 10 bucks an hour.  This man is a disgrace to be called 'business man'.  He is a schyster.  He lies, steals, and makes fraudulant plans.  The ONLY thing that he's EVER done well and honest are the storage units, and I am amazed.  Maybe he'll turn out decent, but for now, he's got like 10 schemes going on.  In addition to Hocking Pfizer.  Oh well, if you need to trust him, only trust the Units, you can trust me on that.  Steve/Lucy: My parents, you know, blah blah.  Mom's Dutch Born and my dad was a rich whitey in Indonesia/Singapore growing up.  Quite the non-average family, but then again, are there any average families?  And then there's me.  15, smart (I think), egotistical, paranoid (somewhat), and likes to make side frequent 'asides'(like this).  I'd say I write well when I want to, but thats not frequent.  I broke up with my girl, which is alright, we're cool.  I'm sticking it out in Martial training once again, and trying to stay cool with my buddies.  Every cowboy has a sad story, and I have some somewhat sad ones (as in, if I told them all, you would be 'tsk, aw, thats so sad!'), but I still consider myself a lucky man....  What else, guys?  Did I leave anyone out that wants some explaining?  I frequently ponder on the world's state.  We're fucked.  My generation is not good enough to keep stuff working, but I'm something of a pessimist.  And then I think about what it'll like to become old, enfeebled. Then death.  Wondering about wtf will happen, you know?  I bet you don't know. But I bet you do wonder.  More on this later, maybe.  I'm tired of writing now.  I'll explain myself a little later, since my blogging recently is lacking content.
