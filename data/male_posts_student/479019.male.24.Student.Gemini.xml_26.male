As you might have noticed, my site is on a new server (slow ass cox.net), and I've done some redesigning (again!). This time using www.blogger.com and an old webpage design. I hope to get things fully functional soon, but "so much to do, so little time." I still have to finish my reading and prepare for my presentation for my history of coffee class, read another entire book for Depression culture class, and do homework for sociology of mass communications and stats! Other stuff that's on my to do list includes finish my family portrait and host a small dinner tomorrow night!  In rotation right now is Weezer's "Blue" album (1994) and "Pinkerton" (1996).  ***
