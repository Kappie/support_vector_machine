I was up at 6:30am, which is very rare for me since I haven't gotten up that early since I had to leave for the airport when I was in Seattle, back in March. That is pretty scary, I need to be able to get up that early on school days but it doesn't seem to work that well.  Anyways, Geri and I had a game of rings outside at the back before work because we wanted something interesting to do. She's not in until 11:30am so now I am just sitting in the lounge typing this interesting entry.   My coffee is now cold, so I think I will stop drinking it. Cold coffee tastes disgusting.   Well this I am going to make short and sweet, and I am going to go have another cigarette before I sign my life away for the next 8 hours.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Talk to you all later.
