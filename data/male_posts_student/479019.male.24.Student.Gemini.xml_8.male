I've been managing to catch shows ranging from Simpsons, Buffy, WWF, Malcom in the Middle, Titus, Family Guy and King of the Hill. This is cool because now I feel like a part of society again! Induling in culture! I'm such a hypocrite for saying that because I was protesting to Lisa about my rejection of the notion of culture 2 nights ago. Well... of course culture matters! It still is, however, a social construction. Too bad we are cogs in the machine we call society!  I managed to get some more work on my painting done. It's too bad the time that went into it should have gone into more reading time. So much to do, so little time!  Well... hopefully I'll have more time tomorrow due to there being no school. I still have work though.  ****
