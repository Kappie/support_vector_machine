If you do not take seconds, or try at least two kinds of pie, you are a rude guest/host/family member. Aunt Ethel was working all day to make those 23 pies, galldurnit, eat sumpthin'! I find it strange because here in America two-thirds of us are overweight. You'd think that there were other days where this was really acceptable. Yes, Christmas is filled with ham and whatnot, but it's more about spending money (more about that later). The Fourth of July has hot-dog eating contests, but the latest champion--two years running--has been Japanese (competitors say it's unfair because the Japanese have two stomachs; no joke)! Easter has those big chocolate bunnies where you bite the ears off first, but nobody ever finishes them. On a side note, I was wondering why they didn't have big chocolate Jesuses instead, and then I though about how we eat the bunnies. For the first time, the chocolate rabbits made sense!   Do I?
