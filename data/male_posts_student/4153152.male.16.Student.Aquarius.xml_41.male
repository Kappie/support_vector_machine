From the moment the movie started, you could tell that this was a different director. Doug Liman did the first movie, and I thought he did an excellent job. The filming was loose, but it looked good. The story was nothing like the book, but it was alright. Here, the filming is beyond loose. Many of the scenes looked like they were filmed during a god damn earthquake. The shots moved all over the place, you couldn't see what was going on, and they could have used a fat man in a black coat for most of the shots with how blurry it all was. The fight scenes were no longer clean. Imagine some blobs in a lava lamp running into each other, and you've pretty much got it.  Then the story. Oh, the story. I have not read the second book, so maybe this is how it's supposed to be. But this felt like a movie made for somebody else. Bourne is no longer this superskilled Treadstone agent. He still has the skills, but the director tried to portray him as.....I don't know, it's hard to describe. But he makes Bourne into something different that what he was. Bourne in the first movie was the best, peerless. Now he's just a broken man with some nice skills.  I went to this movie expecting to see, like the first movie, a unique action film with some drama aspects. I saw a drama that had a hint of action here and there. Like a garnish on a fancy dinner. It's a necessary formality. The best thing I can compare it to is The Matrix. The first one was great, and then they went nuts on the second one and screwed it over. I'm going to go watch the first movie again, and then pretend like there is no sequel.  As for everything else I wanted to say...we'll talk about that later.
