Lessons were slow apart from IT, which, again, mostly consisted of me and Nat going completely crazy, and me trying to get everyone to try talking through their noses. *FNEEEEEEUUHHH*  Lunch was completely insane as usual, everyone either doing nothing, or running round the field inanely, or doing frontflips onto piles of bags. Whoopeedoo. And the science presentation me and Jack did rules. Though its almost completely off subject and spends most the time taking the piss out of: a) Americans b) Joe c) The pollution caused by Mr T's HELLUVA FAST VAN (The A-Team)  Yes. So we're either gonna stick in a load of unreadable on-subject text at the end, or get 'Unsatisfactory' and one of Mr Goodwin's 'punishments'. And tomorrow will be good. Only one lesson where I expect to have to do any work. And thats geography. Booo sucks to Harry Hun.  Victor - "UNBEELIEVABLE! Do you see what I just found in one of those crackers you got? Question: Whats the difference between Victor Meldrew and a chef who keeps dropping his pancakes? Answer: They're both useless tossers!"  Margret - "Shes dead!" Crowd - *worried mumblings* Victor - "She can't be dead, shes a bloody health and fitness instructor!"
