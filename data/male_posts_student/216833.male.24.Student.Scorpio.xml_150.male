They got caught up in some fog on Monday night driving across the delta. From what I hear from mimi, her mom freaked and I am just glad I wasn't in the car. I'm sure I would have been pissed.  Went to the DMV yesterday and failed my motorcycle test, the written part. I went with mimi today and passed it. She got her license as well. So we are really in california.  After that we went to walmart and target to try and get a roll of film developed. We also ordered some holiday cards with out picture on them.   We went and eat at The Cantina in Downtown Santa Rosa after driving around for 15 minutes trying to find a place to park. I started the day off busy. We parked at a meter, luck me, it had an hour on it. I maxxed it at 2 hours and put the rest of my change in the fellow next to me.  After eating, we headed back to the car, and a college guy stopped us and offered me $1 for my leftovers. I hooked him up for sure with a fish taco and lots of veggies. That made me feel good, he was stoked. It would have been hard to justify me denying him food. I had just eaten, I didn't need to leftovers, plus its good karma.  We looked at some apartments in petaluma, and OH. my interview this morning went really well. I am just waiting on a call from them early next weeks to see if they wanna do a face to face interview. I hope that works out, becuase I think I can be a very volitaile part of their crew. I am about to go to bed, just got to finish my booze and crash out. I do more drinking these days then working out. Not good, I've lost weight, but you can't tell, i think i have lost muscle mass.   current mood: accomplished current music: white stripes - Fell in Love With a Girl
