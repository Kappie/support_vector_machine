(*makes mental note to show that flier to parents*) got to sit with adam s., josh, peter, russ and jacob, don't normally get to talk to all them. the best part about today?  I PASSED ALL MY GRADUATION TESTS AND PASSED WITH DISTINCTION ON 2 OUT OF 4!!!  *phew* i was worried that maybe i hadn't done well on them, but i was proved wrong. talayna was so happy, we both did really well, she sat beside me and we talked and she was literally bouncing in her chair. (she was one of the gals who left their #'s ;)) i feel sorry for those seniors who didn't pass some of their tests, they don't get to graduate :(. we have to take them as juniors, in case we fail one, so we take them again as seniors. as long as i pass all my classes next year - which i will of course - i'm set to go for graduation!  anyways, the rest of the day pretty much rocked, 'cept for makin a 50 on a test! oops! lol well i'll post again later, but i gtg catch my friend and some ppl from his youth group on the radio. (95.3 - The Hook baby yeah!)  lata! God bless!
