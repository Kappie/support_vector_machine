If I could live in any time it would definitely be either before the Meiji era or the early 1900s in Japan that is. I have also been fond of the Wild West era of America. Ha I guess I am just a hero kind of guy. Cowboys and samurais always seemed so cool and brave always saving the damsel in distress and other heroic deeds. Anyway, I am losing track of what I wanted to say. I have gained an even greater respect of the Japanese from this book. They have such a dignified and polite manner. Well, that is about it for today. I suppose it is just too late or something. See you later.
