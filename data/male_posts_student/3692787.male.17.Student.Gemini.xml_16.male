Gumising ka na! Kanina pa nagsimula ang klase mo! Hoy! Nakikinig ka ba sakin??!? *The boy merely lies there and drools. The mother's face changes; her eyes turninto angry eyes with no pupils, a vein pops out on her forehead, and she gains a fang on the right side of her clenched white teeth. She storms out of the room with white puffs of smoke exuding from her head and closes the door. She quickly returns with a bucket of water, her expression the same as it was. She douses her son, who jumps up. His face suddenly turns into one whose eyes are wide awake, his teeth clenched, his arms flailing in the air.* Mother: Sa wakas gising ka na rin! Pumasok ka na at nagsisimula na ang klase mo! Hiroshi: Inay, matagal pa ang klase ko! Alassiyete pa simula nun!  *He sits up, eyes glazed, obviously still sleepy. His mother, who looks more annoyed than angry now, with her eyes closed and her mouth shut tight, grabs a digital clock. She pointsto the time: 6:55. Hiroshi still looks dazed, but his expression suddenly changes into one of utter panic.* Hiroshi: Naku huli na ko! *Grabs clothes and puts them on in a hurry. He rushes down the stairs and grabs a piece of toast from the plate on the end table.* Hiroshi: *shouting* 'Nay mauna na 'ko! *Hiroshi is running towards the camera. His mother is shown on the second floor balcony, carrying a broom.* Mother: Hoy Hiroshi bilisan mo! Ikaw talagang bata kaaa!  *Hiroshi runs through the sidewalk, where he passes a lamppost every ten seconds. His bag is on a strap around his upper body and his left arm is carrying his books. His eyes are wide, his cheeks exaggerated in front of him. He has no mouth, but a piece of toast seems to be stuck to his face where his mouth should be. As he turns a corner, the perspective changes into first person, his view surrounded by streaks of wind. Just as he turns, he catches sight of a girl directly in front of him, who suddenly turns to face him. The screen turns black for a split-second with stars and red, yellow and blue streaks shooting out from the center of the screen.* Girl: Aray... Ang sakit... *rubs head* Hiroshi: Hoy Ayumi, tumingin-tingin ka nga sa dinadaanan mo! Ayumi: Ang kapal talaga ng mukha mo Hiroshi! Ikaw ang naka-bangga sakin eh! Hiroshi: A bahala ka! Male-late na ko! *runs off* Ayumi: Uy teka! Hiroshi hintayin mo akooh! *They are shown running outside the gate of their school, which is a big white building consisting of a central tower with matching clock, an east and west wing, and a rooftop area with rails. The shot changes to that of the classroom, where a boy looks out the window as his teacher discusses the lesson. He looks outside, and the angle changes to a shot of the school grounds, where Hiroshi and Ayumi are shown running towards the building.* Boy #1: Psst! Kaji! Sina Hiroshi yun diba? Kaji: Oo nga no! Nahuli na naman sila! Boy #1: Naku, lagot sila niyan kay ser! *The shot changes to show the teacher discussing in side view, while we can see the sliding door.* Teacher: So here we learn that when we multiply x to this... *The sliding door bursts open. Hiroshi props one arm against the wall and looks down, gasping for air. Ayumi slowly runs up behind him, stops right next to him, puts her hands on her knees and does the same.* Teacher: Kayong dalawa! Huli na naman kayo sa klase ko! Pang-ilang beses na itong nangyayari! Alam niyo, wala na akong pakialam kung nagde-date kayo, wag niyo lang hayaang maka-apekto sa schoolwork ninyo! *The rest of the class laughs.* Hiroshi and Ayumi: *bows* Patawad po, hindi na po mauulit. Teacher: Ilang beses niyo na ring sinabi iyan, ngunit heto, late na naman kayo! Magsi-upo na nga kayo, at wag niyo nang istorbohin ang klase ko! Hiroshi and Ayumi: Opo ser... *The two take adjacent empty seats. They converse in whispers.* Ayumi: Pambihira ka talaga Hiroshi! Na-late na naman ako dahil sayo! Hiroshi: Pwede ba, makinig ka nga! At saka late ka na rin naman talaga a! Ayumi: Uy hinde noh! Sakto lang ang pagdating ko kung hindi mo ako nakasalubong! Nakakainis ka talaga! Hiroshi: Bahala ka! Pangit ka naman! *belat* (Note: Ideally, she is rather pretty, but Hiroshi calls her "pangit" nonetheless) Teacher: Kayong dalawa! Diba't sinabi ko wag na kayong maingay? Ang titigas ng ulo ninyo! Pwes, mamaya ay manatili kayo pagkatapos ng klase at ipapa-detention ko kayo! *Ayumi's face is one of shock and horror. Hiroshi merely sighs angrily.* Hiroshi: Ayan, ikaw kasi eh, ang kulit mo... *Ayumi's expression changes: her eyes are angry and without pupils, her mouth disappears and a vein throbs on her forehead.*  *The clock on the tower shows 12 o'clock noon. The lunch bell sounds and the students eat their boxed lunches in class.* Nerd: O Ayumi, ano na naman ang ginawa ng boyfriend mo sayo? Ayumi: Jin, hindi ko siya boyfriend noh! Saka wala yun, ganun lang talaga si Hiroshi! *grabs some food and munches on it furiously* Jin: Alam mo, huwag ka na magkunwari! Alam ko ang katotohanan! Ang masasabi ko lang, kung ako na lang ang pinili mo ay hindi ka magsisisi ng ganyan! Ayumi: *annoyed expression, coupled with disgust* Jin, wag kang ganyan! Sinabi ko na naman sayo eh! Pwede ba wag kang makulit at masama ang araw ko ngayon?! Jin: Yumi-chan... Kung alam mo lang sana kung paano ako magmahal, matagal mo nang nakalimutan ang iyong boyfr-- *Jin's sentence is cut off. Ayumi's face turns red with rage, her eyes in anger, vein throbbing, teeth clenched. She socks Jin with an uppercut, which, apparently, is enough to send him flying out of the window and off into the distance, screaming "Yuuuummmmmmiiiiiiiiiii!" until he gets so far off into the horizon that he disappears from view, but not without first turning into a brief flash of a white speck of light.*  *Japanese characters on the whiteboard read "detention 2:00-4:00". Ayumi's arms are crossed on her desk, hereyes staring at the board but blank yet melancholy in expression. Hiroshi is in the back row, his feet on the empty chair in front of him, trying to get some sleep. A few seats away from him is a big bald guy, who gets up and sits next to Ayumi.* Bald guy: Hehehe... Ano naman ang ginagawa mo dito binibini? Anong napakalaking sala naman ang nagawa mo para mapadpad ka sa katayuang ito? Heeheeheeheehee... Hiroshi: *position unchanged, eyes closed*Hoy Geese, tumigil ka nga. Kaya lang kami nandito ay dahil nahuli kami sa pagdating sa klase. Hindi kami tulad mo na walanangkwenta ang buhay at wala nang kinabukasan. Geese: *looks at Hiroshi, stands up and slams his hand on a table right next to him* Anong sinasabi mo bata? Hindi ka ba tinuruan ng respeto sa mga nakatatanda sayo? Hiroshi: *opens eye nearer to Geese* Ha? Ang respeto ko ay ibinibigay ko lamang sa mga karapat-dapat. Ang mga taong tulad mo ay nilalapastangan, hindi rinerespeto. Geese: A-ano? Anong akala mo sa sarili mo? Wag kang magkakamali, kayang-kaya kitang saktan! Isa ka lang kuto sa paningin ko! Hiroshi: *closes eyes again* E di patunayan mo. *Geese sits down looking angry. He looks at Ayumi still, with a hint of malice in his eyes.* Geese: Binibini, hindi ba't ikaw ang kausap ko? *smiles and looks back at Hiroshi, who pretends to be indifferent to the situation* Ayumi: Pwede ba? Hindi kita gustong kausapin. Manahimik ka na lang at matatapos na rin naman ito. *Geese looks thoroughly pissed, and he sits down and shuts up. He looks at Hiroshi again, who is in the same position but is now smiling.* Geese: *whispers to himself* Magbabayad kayo...  *The clocktower shows 4:00. The shot shows Hiroshi standing up.* Ayumi: Hiroshi, sabay na tayo umuwi. Si mama kasi eh, magagalit pag wala akong kasama. *Hiroshi is walking with his hands behind his head ala Yusuke from Yu Yu Hakusho. His eyes are closed, but in his response, he opens the eye nearer Ayumi.* Hiroshi: Bahala ka. C-CR lang ako, antay ka lang dyan. *Hiroshi is shown exiting through the sliding door. Ayumi sits back down, but the angle is such that we can see Geese smiling behind her, an evil, scheming smile. We see Hiroshi washing his hands.* Hiroshi: *mumbling* Ano ba naman to, ihahatid ko pa ang pesteng yun. *Hiroshi exits the bathroom and walks the short distance back to the classroom. He opens the sliding door, his eyes still closed.* Hiroshi: Ayumi, tena, kailangan ko na ring makauwi.  *No response. He opens his eyes and looks at towards the chairs. They are all empty.* Hiroshi: Ayumi? *Hiroshi looks at the board of chalk. Japanese characters are written on it, but Geese's voice reads the dialogue.* Geese's voice: Kasama ko ngayon si Ayumi. Kung ayaw mo siyang mapahamak, pumunta ka sa West wing rooftop ngayon din. *Hiroshi exhibits a calm sense of anger.* Hiroshi: Geese... Pambihira ka talaga! *He runs out of the classroom.*  *Hiroshi kicks the door of the West wing rooftop open. He walks through it and shouts.* Hiroshi: Geese! Asan ka? Magpakita ka ngayon sa akin! *Geese isleaning againstthe railing, where Ayumi is gagged and tied by a rope (all her clothes are on. perv.)* Geese: Nagpakita ka rin Hiroshi... Hindi kita mapapatawad sa ginawa mo sa akin. Hindi ka maaaring mabuhay pa. Ito na ang katapusan mo! *Hiroshi looks unfazed by this proclamation. He gets into a fighting stance.* Hiroshi: Magbabayad ka Geese. Matitikman mo ngayon ang kapangyarihan ng aking Setsuna-style Martial Arts. Geese: HAHAHAHAHAAAA!!! Walang kwenta! *gets into stance* Hindi mo ata alam ito, pero isa ako sa pinaka-mahusay na estudyante ng Heaven and Earth infusion fighting style! Humanda ka ngayon bata! *Geese rushes forward. He tries to grab Hiroshi, who jumps over Geese and ends up behind him. Geese tries to hit Hiroshi with a reverse punch, but Hiroshi ducks. Hiroshi trips Geese, and Geese falls down. Hiroshi merely jumps farther away and readies himself for Geese's attack.* Geese: Hehehe... Mahusay. Hindi ko akalaing marunong ka rin palang lumaban. May kaya ka rin naman palang marating dyan sa iyong Setsuna-style. Subalit! *stamps both feet firmly on the ground ala Sumo* Ako'y nagsisimula pa lamang. Halika bata! Subukan mo ang aking kapangyarihan! *Hiroshi looks calm, then he strikes. He lunges forward and attempts a punch, but in a slow-mo split-second, Geese is able to dodge this punch and grab Hiroshi's arm. Geese swings Hiroshi and slams him to the ground.* Geese: *holding Hiroshi by the arm* Hahaha... Napasubo ka sa labang ito! Hindi ko na patatagalin pa! Heto na! Earth Dragon Fist! *Hiroshi was able to avoid the attack, contorting himself to end up with his hands over Geese's eyes and his feet perched on Geese's back. The Earth Dragon fist connected on the floor creating a hole that went clear through the lower classroom's ceiling. Hiroshi used some leverage on Geese's back to do a backflip and jump a little farther away.* Geese: Grr... Nagawa mo pang iwasan ang aking pagsalakay... Hiroshi: Tama ka nga Geese; hindi na magtatagal ang laban na ito. Walang kinalaman si Ayumi sa ating dalawa, ngunit ninais mo pa ring saktan siya, at dahil dito'y hindi kita mapapatawad. *camera shows Ayumi, pupils quivering yet eyessteady, slightly flushed* Ikaw naman Geese; ipakita mo sa kin ang kayang gawin ng iyong Earth and Heaven infusion techniques! Geese: *battlecry* Seven Star Strike! *Geese attempted a truly magnificent combination of attacks on Hiroshi: punch-punch-kick-punch-kick-kick-grab. Geese performed this with tremendous speed and skill, but unfortunately, Hiroshi was able to guard against the first six strikes and dodge against the last strike completely, leaving Geese vulnerable to attack. Hiroshi grabbed Geese's left arm with his left hand, leaving his right hand free to strike.* Hiroshi: SerpentPalm on Blooming Lotus! *The screen turned black. Five Japanese characters in white appear in the middle of the screen one at a time in quick succession. The screen then switches to Geese's upper body, which has a big imprint where Hiroshi hit him. Geese's eyes went blank, and Hiroshi let go of Geese's left arm just as he fell to the floor. Hiroshi clenched his right hand to a fist and looked at it, then he looked at Ayumi. He slowly walked towards her, untied her and removed the fabricfrom her mouth.* Ayumi: Hi-Hiroshi! Si Geese... A-ano-- Hiroshi: ...mamaya ay magigising rin yan. Tara, iwan na natin siya dito. Kailangan na nating umuwi. *smiles* Ayumi: *blank sorta stupid expression with the quavering pupils, gives a nod.*  *The two are walking on the sidewalk. Hiroshi is ahead by a bit, his hands behind his head again. Ayumi is looking down on the ground.* Ayumi: *stops and looks at Hiroshi* Hiroshi... Hiroshi: *stops, but does not turn to face her* Hindi mo na kailangan pang magpasalamat. Ayumi: Hindi yun... Bakit... bakit mo ko iniligtas? Hiroshi: *momentary silence* Hindi para sa iyo yun, naiinis lang talaga ako kay Geese. Ayumi: G-ganun ba... *looks down on the ground again* Hiroshi: *turns around, has a serious * Pero, syempre, hindi ko naman magagawang maiwan ka. Alam mo na, kahit paano'y magkaibigan naman tayo diba? At saka, kailangan kong tulungan ang isang taong tulad mo... *Ayumi looks at Hiroshi with the same quavering expression* Hiroshi: *Hiroshi reverts to a silly expression*...na napaka-pangit na babae! Ang swerte mo at napaka-bait kong nilalang, kundi kasama mo pa rin yung kalbong yun hanggang ngayon! *runs off* Ayumi: *mad expression, pupil-less eyes* Napakasama mo talaga Hiroshi! Nakakainis kaaaa! *runs after him* *Hiroshi is shown running off, smiling. Ayumi is then shown running after him; she is also smiling now. The shot changes to one behind Ayumi where the two can be seen running into the horizon. The scene turns into a pastel rendition, the narrator says some stuff and "to be continued" written in Japanese letters pops up on the lower-right side of the screen.*  completely wrong thought of the day: I don't diss activists. They fight for what they believe in and I respect that. It's just that seeing them in action is still just a tad awkward for me. I remember the other day during my Philo 11 class when a bunch of activists went walking by, demandingthat the RP Humanitarian Contingent be pulled out of Iraq to save Angelo dela Cruz. Ok, not a bad cause, but dude, they formed like this really long line. I half-expected a drum and lyre band to be trailing behind them playing "Angelina" or something.  Oh, and I am also particularly fond of my third year adviser's story. Some group wanted the freshies to sign something that would stop commercialization in UP.Things like "tuta ng mga merchant" were thrown left and right. Still, my adviser was all, "If I sign this, what then? UP has no money. If this is the only way to get money, why should we fight it?" The group hit her with some info, but the fact remained--they had not answered her question. She was the only freshie who didn't sign that thing. Aww yeah! She so hardcore, she doesn't even conform to the non-conformists! Bam bam!
