Getting 12 people, plus the two guests of honour, to the restaurant at the right time is no mean feat, especially considering the state of Auckland traffic at that time of the evening! Also fooling Dave and Helen into thinking they were just having dinner with  urlLink Rach  was tricky, but we pulled it off, and they had no idea. That was very satisfying, as Dave is not an easy person to fool.  Overall we had a good night, as it was a group of people at pretty much the same age and stage in life, good friends, and sharing a meal with friends about to move away. I'm really glad to have done it, but I won't be organizing any more surprise events for a while, as the stress I can do without!   urlLink Rach  will have some photos of the night  urlLink here
