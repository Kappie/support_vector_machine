Here I am with five days stretched like a vast, wide-open prairie in front of me, and I don't know what to do with myself.  This day has dragged on mercilessly, and while I was drunk with serenity after having slept for 10 hours, I suddenly found myself with nothing to do.  My mom says I should clean my room, but I say pooh-pooh to that.  Did I just say pooh-pooh?  Can you tell how this day is having a bad effect on my intelligence?  Luckily (or perhaps unluckily), tomorrow my family and I will travel with my grandmother to Crocket, TX, where we will meet the rest of our TX family (or most of it) at my great-Aunt Christine's house.  I'm glad because I haven't seen most of my non-immediate family in quite a while, but at the same time...I hate car rides!  WAAAHHH!!!  I can't say that today was a complete waste, though.  I worked diligently in my French workbook today after several weeks of neglecting my third language.  I've had Spanish crammed down my throat at school every day (even though I love it to death) and I've really been trying to pick up Italian lately, so I'd kind of pushed po' lil' ol' French to the side.  However, thanks to my friend Alec, I have my first French book to read:  Quinze Ans , which means 15 Years for all of you non-French speakers.  Wow, I'm really condescending today.  Guess I should stop.  Well, back to mind-numbing-yet-totally-brainless monotony.  Au revoir!
