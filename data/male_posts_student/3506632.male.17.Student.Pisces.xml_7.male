We do not get a good night’s sleep, unless we have returned the calls of those who matter. We don't let any call go unanswered as long as we know that it matters. Don't we?  But how about the calls of " hay-yaa al-as-salaah and hay-yaa al-al falah " made from the neighbourhood house of our master, the Almighty Allah.?  Those calls are made five times a day and many a times they all go unanswered.  We do not either respond!!! Nor do we respect these missed calls. Do they matter?  Everybody can tell, if these really matter. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but surely in the hereafter.  Let us look at ourselves. Can we afford to let these calls of the muezzin be missed, day after day, after day.  The call from our cherisher, sustainer and the ultimate master.  Just think about it.  Next time one hears this call, just ask yourself how good a night’s sleep can I have by missing those calls from the house of Allah  Think about it....the answer may come from the inner heart.
