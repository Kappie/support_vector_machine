On Saturday, I went grocery shopping, suit shopping and as the hours carried on, I was shopping for a clear thought. Sunday was a day to chill and clean up. I took a break and saw a film - and now it's Monday and I am thinking back on all the silly fun shit.  Let me get back to Friday night, I finished up work as fast as I could, I was supposed to meet James at 7pm and I didn't want to keep him waiting. I raced home to change my shirt and shoes(ritualistically) and pick up mimi, she went with me. All the while making record time, I pull into James drive-way just under a few minutes from 7. He had two extra tickets to the Craftsman 400 truck series at the Texas Motor Speedway. OH MY FUCKING LORD. I was floored, I was in awe when we pulled into this fucking crazy stadium of wasted energy - I was just so fucking blown away with the display of utter trashiness. Fat - fat -fat -fat everywhere. There were Turkey legs for the classic cavemen, beer by the tons for the idiots, and troglodytes for the mullet-styled fellers. There were wrecked RV's, race-car painted pickups that looked more like moving toilets and tons of really nice motorcycles. It was like a trailor park with out the houses. I would hate to be here on NASCAR day when there are some 250,00 fuckers, this was a light event comparatively. I think somewhere around 80,000 race-fans. That's is alot of - well alot of fucking idiots for sure.  The race was intense, I have to say that much. The feel of the Roman empire was strong, large arena - danger and possible death!! The cheer of the crowd for their favorite local driver was obvious, the boo's when someone gets to close to their hero couldn't even scare a fly. I was definatly charges, excited, and pumped up when those trucks would barrel down the side of the track. Oh well - don't tell anyone. We left a few laps before the race ended. I just imagine how the traffic would be at the end of the race, it wasn't so bad when we left. I have to say, I will never pay for a ticket to see a race, but I'd go again for free of coarse.  On Saturday MiMi and I woke up, wanting to do something but not sure what, so we decided to go buy some groceries - It was a good oppurtunity to handle that mess. MiMi went off to work around 1pm and I went to the mall to just shop. I was looking for a suit and that was an undertaking in itself. I had an idea of what I wanted - and after 4 different stores and about 14 different suit jackets I think I might have found the one I am looking for. I am supposed to pick it up on Thursday. When I got home after buying a new white dress shirt and some new grey dress slacks I started doing the laundry and cleaning up the house. That went pretty smooth - I didn't see anyone till about 10pm - I had a few beers and was feeling pretty warm and happy. Alex and Eric stopped by to play some board games, I think it was called Tribond, I had fun. I pretty much felt like an idiot, but after a while, I got into the groove of thinking - if you can believe that.  Sunday, once again alone, MiMi was off working at her store from 11 - 6 so I finished up the laundry and went to the movies around 1:30. I went and saw the Sum of All Fears and it was alright. I enjoyed it - I havn't seen an action movie on the big screen in a while (except star wars - but that is different.) It was a wonderful day, partly cloudy, and just gorgous - I didn't stay outside much because of the heat but I was one of those days that makes you smile and say "Summer is here!"   I had dinner on the stove when MiMi came home. Some spicy Thai stirfry with a little red curry and yummy thai rice. I dunno the name of my dishes, I just cook what I wanna eat. I also made some chocolate-covered strawberries and boy where they delicious. Watched Proof of Life again with MiMi and ironed all my outfits for the week. I am prepared - bring it on!
