 good idea though... let's decrease our revenue and increase our defense spending... and hope that when our nation's currency is devalued we'll somehow magically have the funds to pay for everything.  smart... and he went to business school where?  harvard?  hmmm... maybe they teach another kind of business @ harvard business school?  when i last checked... it was good to have your revenues exceed your costs... not the other way around.  if bush/cheney and kerry/edwards were to fight... who would win?  maybe we'll find out if they keep campaigning in the  urlLink same  towns.  i'd put my money on kerry/edwards... they have the smarts and youth on their side.  cheney might not even be able to make it to the fight... given his health... and for some reason... bush's 'bama guard credentials don't seem too intimidating.  go  urlLink john mccain .  it's nice to know there are people in government who no matter what their party allegiance is will call people from their own party out and tell them to shut up.  is it true that kerry served his country and later disagreed with it?  yes... but the important fact is... kerry served his country... it was a conscious choice... how do you argue with that?  a good opinion  urlLink piece  on teresa heinz kerry.  like donn esmonde i find women with qualities like teresa heinz kerry intriguing... and attractive.  they won't take crap... and they'll stand up to anything.  if a woman is the comforting supportive person in a relationship that is is good... but not all the time.  even i know that sometimes i'll need a kick in the ass cause i'm being ridiculously dumb.   urlLink this  was upsetting to me.  race relations in the country have progressed... but... not to the extent that people throw race out the window and live together harmoniously.  i'd like to think that eventually we'll get there however long it may take.  what happened to "all men are created equal"?  yes at the time the statement was written it was inferred that 'all men' = caucasian, but we're supposed to be over that... aren't we?  we are the standard that other free nations look to... we have to set a good example... and right now... we aren't doing a very good job... domestically or internationally.  somewhat encouraging  urlLink signs  of slow path to racial income equality.  it's good that the other races in the US feel they have disposable income (di) to increase their overall spending.  while this report doesn't go too in depth with the break downs of stats such as net income... at least it's encouraging to know that di has seemingly gone up for minority groups which i guess would infer that they had greater income than before.  and lastly for links... here's some  urlLink funny  brought to you by will ferrell and ACT, i found from this  urlLink post  on gothamist.  someone remind me to get some jamba juice when i'm in new york.
