Then went surfing net. At 2 plus or so, went SMS Donkey to meet up. Deal. Somerset MRT at 4.30.  Was late 1 hour plus cuz of my GunBound stuff. Panic and rush to meet Donkey. I feel so guilthy... Letting Donkey wait... Ended up Donkey's late also. Donkey reach at around 5 but still I'm late. For 30 minutes... :P  Reach the station and message Donkey, he never reply. Called Donkey. Never pick up.Thought that Donkey's angry le...  Then walked around Somerset. Saw my old working place. that damned OG. Still having that 'Moving Out Sale'. Move so long still got the 'Sale'. Dare cheat people. Knew quite a lot of good friends in OG though. :D  I was really sad. Cuz Donkey ignored me mahz... Went walking for 15 minutes to HMV before sms Donkey and told him of my location. He finnally reply and say he's coming for me.  Met up. Went eating. Donkey's cute. Donkey's nice. Didn't talk too much to him today... Ending up meeting him for 2 hours or lesser then he went to meet another of his group of friends. After he bid me farewell, I was like crying. Tears dropped. I wonder why.  Message Sheng Cai, telling him. He really understand me. :D  He's a very good friend. :)  Meet up with Xinhui and Wanxin after that. Saw some slutty Pearllyn. That slut. Went Swensen to eat. I do spent alot... Got to control my expenses le. Then talk around and play around then go home. I really like Wanxin and Xinhui. Cuz they are my super good friends mahz.  Need to study. Tests start this Monday.  I really like Donkey. But... Hiaz...  I think there's no chance lorhz...
