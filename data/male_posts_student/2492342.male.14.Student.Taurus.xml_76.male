Let me surrender my soul, Let the shot kill me now...  Alne I ate, Alone I drank, Alone I smoke, ALone I coughed, Blood around me...  Alone I took the knife and dove it deep...  My stress is gone...  What a relief...Peace be mine. Don't ever leave me,  God, my love, I've missed you so.  Free from anxiety, from fear, from everything.  Liberated.  Protect me now...Let me never fall.  Cover my body, naked, falling, so alone.  With this I must perish, with this my meaningless existence falls.  Surrender my soul, Let my mind die fucked by the bullet...
