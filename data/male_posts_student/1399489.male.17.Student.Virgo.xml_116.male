In b-ham, on the way to atlanta, i got to meet a bunch more of katie mac's friends, espically at the bday/going away party.  it was great fun, they all make me laugh, very hyper ppl lol.  I just had a great time overall there, playing (even with her little brother), hangin out, seeing mountianbrook, riding 4wheelers!!, etc.   ATL was a blast too!, well besides the hard forced labor.  it did make me feel accomplished though, i painted a mailbox, and a table, and killed a tree full and hill full of cudzu, oh and helped move everything to the house. ahh and last night, that was fun, i went to laurens friends house (ritu) and she has a cookout/party haha. :) it was fun.  ok well im gonna go finish my blizzard and watch some more spiderman/ mib II.  Be back to reality/jackson tomorrow :/ but only for a week (plus a few days)! then off to da boat! ok good bye bye.
