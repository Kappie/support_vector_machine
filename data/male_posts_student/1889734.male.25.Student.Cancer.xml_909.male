"While in Boston, Moore will be honored by the Congressional Black Caucus and plans to address its membership. This event will take place at 4:00 in the afternoon on Monday, July 26th at the Sheraton Hotel in Boston."   Are we agreed that Michael Moore is a Leftist kook?  If so, then what does that make the Congressional Black Caucus, composed of Congressmen and Senators who happen to be black, and all happen to be democrats?
