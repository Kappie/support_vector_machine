Time for that later.  Anyways, Lark was a no show, of course...  Not like anyone who just had major surgery would show up to a TKD lesson 3 days later.  Umm... yeah.  So it was just me and Tiff and John didnt have the kids, so we expected a massive huge training session with just us.  Well, didnt happen.  A tad bit disappointed, but whatever.  Got to learn a bit more on pressure points and stuff.  Thats gonna take me a while to learn, but well worth it I think.  I could use all the positive stuff there is.  Body feels like its gonna fall apart.  Especially in the legs.  I think there is a point that you hit where you start having issues with strength vs flexibility.  Bill can back me up on this one.  Throw in some length/tension curves, talk about sarcomere bridge cycling, band length, etc.  Wow do I miss science.  Maybe I can try and justify Chi as a physiological response.  Good lord, I have the training for it.  Bedtime.  Starting to cough again.... If I get sick more than I already am, so help me God...  I dunno... it wont be nice.    Baby Liver All You Can Eat! 5.95  This message brought to you by the Dome on the corner of Wolf and Joliet Rd. I couldnt help just thinking this sign was hysterical.  Maybe Im just sick...  Oh yeah, note to self:  Sam needs to see Monty Python's Life of Brian      "Life is full of shit, when you look at it.  Life's a laugh and Death's a joke it's true               You'll see its all a show, keep em laughin as you go, and you'll find that the last laugh is on you!                       And always look on the bright side of life..."   Sorry best I could do with the lyrics right off top of my head
