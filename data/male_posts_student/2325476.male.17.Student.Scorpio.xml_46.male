You've had your first leson, in learning the blues.  The cigarettes you light, one after another, won't help you forget her, and the way that you love her. You're only burning, a torch you can't lose. But you're on the right track, for learning the blues.  When you're at home alone, the blues will taunt you constantly. When you're out in a crowd, the blues will haunt your memory.  The nights that you don't sleep, that whole night you're crying. But you can't forget her, soon you even stop trying. You'll walk that floor, and wear out your shoes. When you feel your heart break, You're learning the blues.
