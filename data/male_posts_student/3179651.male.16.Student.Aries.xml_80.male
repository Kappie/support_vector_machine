My bathroom SHOULD NOT SMELL LIKE OLD! There are towels everywhere, like over the shower railing, on all the racks, door handles. PLUS, the decide my sink is the best one to use. All my shot constantly gets moved around by my brother an my mom when she decides to 'clean' and now i have 2 other people doing it! Dinner last night sucked, we have a new table and i couldnt fit without hitting my legs on my grandma and my elbows on my mom and dad. This meant that I had to wait for my dinenr or have my mom bitch about im too big. If this was my friends i wouldnt care because they ar nice, but my family seems so artificial and im barely even talkign to my grandparents because i just dont like this many people in the house. I havent seen them in over a year, and barely talked to them, and now my whole world is raining down because of  them...      Bean, the ledger sleepover is a go for monday i think... My dad was liek no, yoru coming home and i was like i dont have a choice.. Yeah. Im saying like to much. Mom didnt say much, but i told her how late we could be so im just going.       Burnt you a cdcalled LEDGER DANCE PARTY!   --- Cheers, Ricky  	  Edit: So when i post by email, i have to get rid of yahoo ads still. Damn it
