      Yo yo yo, Nick. Good to hear things are going ok in Naples, Italy. I mean, Sofla. I also saw Fahrenheit 9/11 the other night. I really enjoyed it, but it was kind of propagandaish, right? I mean, don't get me wrong, I love propaganda if I agree with its message, but he may come across as a bully to those who don't agree with him. Anyway, I really hope Bush doesn't get reelected, although I can't do anything about it. Of course, my general sense of disillusionment about the government as a whole makes me think that nobody has pure ideals when they go into politics. I guess you just have to vote based on which pocket the candidate is in is worse. Should I even be saying this stuff? I don't really want to be carted off to Guantanamo Bay or anything.   So it's been a little while since I posted, and I am sorry, although I have done a better job keeping up with this thing than I thought. I guess I have one last little ranty list that I want to put together more for my own benefit than the 3 or 4 readers this weblog may have. So this is the top 5 things I want out of life. After I write this out I'll start being funny again.   1. A house in the country and an apartment in a major metropolis.  I guess I could take either-or, but both is ideal. I love how when you're in the country night is so silent, and the stars just jump out at you. No airplanes or ghetto birds buzzing you at night, no drunk sorority girls singing 80s songs in the street, and no yellowey street lights washing out the sky. Of course, I also kind of like the hustle and bustle of big cities. Not that I've been to too many, just St. Louis, Atlanta, and Chicago, but I really loved the pace of Chicago. I think that's a place I'd like to live if I ever had the money and half a choice.   2. Money  This seems so banal, but it would just make things so much easier. I know you hear a lot of famous people saying "Oh, money doesn't make life easy," or fairy tales that teach us "It isn't what you own," but yeah, it kind of is what you own, or that you don't have to worry about things, like paying for the hospital, or where the next meal is coming from. In fact, this should maybe be number one. That would just make me look like some 1986 greed dealer. Oh well. Anybody who has been in the real world knows a million dollars would make everything a hell of a lot easier. Fuck those lying Hollywood fucks.  3. Time to travel  I was reading the Alphabet of Desire by Barbara Hamby the other day and there are a ton of poems in there that just have to do with jetting off to Europe for a few months or whatever. This is the kind of thing I'd like to be able to do. But maybe not just this, but also the ability to just get up and say, yeah, I'm going to take work off for the next week and drive to Nebraska. I guess I want my job to be a side note.  4. Somebody to love  Man, my list is so cliche, but aren't cliches sometimes true? I don't care how supposedly "quirky-alone" I am, or how much some infantile relationship would destroy my entire life right now, at some point I would like a girl who could just stop and look at things with me, take a week off work to drive to Nebraska (not that I have some fixation with Nebraska, but that's just the example), or feed me alphabet soup when I run out of words. I cheated on that last one, because I used that line in a poem a long time ago. It's still true, though. Also, after attending Megacon I realized the kind of girl for me is the kind of girl who'd dress up as a comic book character. In fact, the kind of girl for me would buy a bunch of different comics than me every week so we could switch around on wednesday. Man, I'm such a picky nerd.  5. Fame  Ok, so my list is the lamest list in the history of lists. These are exactly the same five things that everybody probably wants. But let me justify this fame thing. I don't necessarily want to have people shouting my name on the street or asking me for my autograph, but I would like respect in my field. That is, I would like people I've never met reading my work and citing me as an influence. When I do a reading somewhere I would like for there to be a good sized audience, and to have sycophants come up to me and say how moved they were by whatever the hell it was that I read. This all sounds so trite, but it'd be kind of affirming, right? I mean, it would mean I'm good at what I do, which I guess I shouldn't tip toe around saying, because it's obvious I'm leaning toward the writing thing. But that would facilitate all of these, if I was good enough. I had better start really trying.   Gots to see me some Spider-man 2 tomorrow.
