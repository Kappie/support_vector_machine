Thursday was the last date of my School's Freshman Camp. I decided to lead again after slacking for so long and I manage to be one of the Cheerleader. =) I played Final Crush for my LT but unfortunately We did not win. Haha we were gang bang by a lage group of other players. This Final Crush is different to that of TPSUs Final Crush. The one and only difference is that there is no rules. Yup, no rules. Haha u can do wad u like and wad u want. U have unlimited water bombs and life! Sounds cool huh. lolx. I just happily waste my 'bombs'. After that we were allowed to throw the 'bombs' at each other. My first target was Yeo! I broke one water bomb at his tummy. Angelic Yeo however did not take revenge on me. lalala I was surrounded by my teammates!!! They throw the bombs onto my pants and shirt! My underwear was soaking wet!   Maybe I should take back my words about there is no pretty babes in my LT. There is one. Yup one. haha. There is this girl in my class who's character who resembles to that of Veralynn's. I notice that she is very cheerful and puts on a big smile on her face most of the time. She is however not as blur as Veralynn. If I'm not wrong she got unless den 9 for her L1R4. Witty girl I must say. =)
