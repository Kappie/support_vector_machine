Better yet, it brings back the days when we played football at recess and after you scored a touchdown you would announce to the other team, “Winner’s stay. Loser’s walk.” Unfortunately I wound up walking even when I had scored a touchdown.   urlLink Filter’s  Take a Picture: Again, the lyrics are the story behind this selection, though I enjoyed Filter’s second album. I especially enjoy when this song blares after I ran a 75-yard touchdown with  urlLink Thomas Jones .  AC/DC’s Thunder: I am typically not an AC/DC fan. The reason I add this song is for the simple fact that at every Minnesota Viking’s game you hear this song played 75 times throughout the game. I’m looking for a little authenticity therefore AC/DC has to be added.   urlLink Chemical Brother’s  Block Rocking Beat: This is an oldie but a goodie, and it has that hook that I can’t get out of my head. This is also the only reason that I did not put techno music on the regulations list (though I do not believe there are any other techno songs that match the quality of this one).   urlLink Metallica’s  Disappear: Ironic, plus a sound that gets the stadium pumping.  Limp Bizkit’s Nookie: This used to be a fan favorite, and I believe it can still be used for good.  So there are 7 songs that should be included in every football video game. Is this the definitive 7? Perish the thought. These 7 songs represent a further outline in choosing the appropriate music for ESPN NFL 2K5, and should increase the enjoyment of a stellar game. I should mention that  urlLink Austin’s  recommendations are great as well: Yellowcard and the Imperia March ( urlLink Darth Vaders’  Theme). Both are songs that I did not think of but would be great additions.  Finally, for those who are wondering, I will not be  urlLink trading  Marty Booker in my season; I already picked up  urlLink Michael Strahan  from the trading block. And with my current team I went 15-1 and I will be playing the Detroit Lions in the NFC Championship game.
