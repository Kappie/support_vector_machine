Yesterday I stayed up an exceedingly long time and got up rather too early. My eyes hurt. I plain hurt. All over one might say.   I have practice today. I can barely stand up-right let alone jump around singing not so classic punk songs. Again thanks squeet. You are the worst in my bad books and have sunk. greatly. I have a calculator on my speaker. It is doing little good. Maths exam is a while off. It'll be ok. maybe. maybe not. Science is rather too soon to bare. God bless it. I shall soon attempt to eat breakfast. After that I shall attempt retaining it in my stomach. With little success I feel. My grammar is now on top form. which is rather bad as you can tell. Going to go peel the crust from the inside of my nostril. not really. I am blowing my nose. exit.
