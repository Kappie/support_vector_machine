The gum itself tastes very bad, but it is so addictive you just want more and more. I ran out last weekend and I was very sad. Now, the BLACK BLACK has returned. I just found out that a friend of mine ordered some, and he is going to sell me some tomorrow. I'm so excited! YAY! MORE CAFFEINE! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Yes, caffeine, that is exactly what I need for finals! YAY!  EDIT: So much for that. Two of my friend in my biology class made me throw it out. :(. Oh, well!   later, bradleyJ
