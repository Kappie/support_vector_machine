I don't have to worry as much about my scent =P   What's there to talk about right now? umm ... I guess i could go on a rant about ..... i dern even know what anymore.  I wanted to blog a while ago about stuff, but I got lazy. That's gettin to be a problem lately. I fear that I'm gettin less than sufficiant grades. I need to dedicate a weekend to just workin out how I'm going to get myself organized n stuff. and to all my friends who read this blog..... that means goin out less....... WAY less. not that I go out more than twice a month but .... eh. How's this for a schedule :            1) no more goin out until my grades improve. The most I'll allow is once or twice a month.                      2) seeing as I usually get about $5/ day for school. This amounts to about $100/ month. So if from now on I only use 1 of those dollars per day, I get $80/ month.... give or take a few.             3) From now on... no more TV until 10 pm. I get home around 4, and take an hour or so for eating and settling down. So I get 5 hours for homework before I get to watch TV. Speaking of homework ...             4) I will do as much of it as possible @ school. This mean's less talking during class, even during free time.             5) If I should happen to fall short of these self-inflicted restrictions, I ask anyone who has read this to punish me ..... to keep me on the ball.   well enough of that. My back and shoulder's hurt, so Ima haul ass outta hurr and go listen to the TV. L8 =)
