All that, for kel, jon, me and ryan. we didnt manage to finish of course, but all of us left with huge buldges on our stomach. i felt sick after, headache and stuff. went home, slept and woke up the next morning having a major headache. went to school nonetheless. the first half of the day was rather ok, until it came to chemo, i felt extremely cold and yada yada yada. went home, discovered i had a high fever. my head hurt like crazy. shivered like crazy at night, but i was laughing, cos it looked like i was going through cold turkey or something hahah.woke up at 3am, with my head banging inside again. i went to take my medicine and sat on the sofa till it was four, and went back to sleep. so here i am now, sitting my ass in front of the computer, feeling nauseous, and having a slight headache. mehhhhhhhh............................
