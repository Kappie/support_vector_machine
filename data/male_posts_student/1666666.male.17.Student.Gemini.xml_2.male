Overall, it was rainy the whole time, but it kept the crowds away so the lines were all but gone. All in all, I had fun. The church even sent me a post card while I was gone, letting me know that I was missed. I've been taking the California achievement Test this week. I think I'm finished with it at this point, but it took me two days just to get through the math portion, so I'm really not sure. Two days of math was really hard to survive, considering my skills and usefulness in that subject. My teacher, however, seems has found a way to possibly get me some kind of certification with Cisco Systems. I had never imagined this to be possible, especially at this age, but you'll never hear me arguing! The process won't start at least until August, so I have some time to read up on more stuff, and better prepare myself; but I'm completely excited about this.
