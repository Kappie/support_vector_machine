I had applied to a few Asian Schools and had an interview with the Director of IT  Operations Management,Nanyang last week which I did reasonably well . He had asked me to check my application status on the web. Got the Confirmation today that I have been offered admission to the 2-yr Full time MBA in IT  Operations Management (ITOM) .                                                  NUS(National Univ of Singapore) , AIM (Asian Inst of Management) are still pending  hopefully will hear from them quite soon. Nanyang is a Top 10 B-School in Asia and is at Singapore.
