Behaving crappy after no nap, bolting out of bed like a farmer at the crack of dawn, losing your hair and teeth, not glancing at the clock as their routine is carved in rock. Don't fear that routine will be your destiny; you are unique. Get well soon.  Let this cheer your heart:  Suddenly it's Christmas, Right after Hallowe'en. Forget about Thanksgiving; It's just a buffet in between. There's lights and tinsel in the windows; They're stocking up the shelves; Santa's slaving at the North Pole In his sweatshop full of elves.  There's got to be a build-up To the day that Christ was born: The halls are decked with pumpkins And the ears of Indian corn. Dragging through the falling leaves In a one-horse open sleigh, Suddenly it's Christmas, Seven weeks before the day.  Suddenly it's Christmas, The longest holiday. When they say "Season's Greetings" They mean just what they say: It's a season, it's a marathon, Retail eternity. It's not over till it's over And you throw away the tree.  Outside it's positively balmy, In the air nary a nip; Suddenly it's Christmas, Unbuttoned and unzipped. Yes, they're working overtime, Santa's little runts; Christmas comes but once a year And goes on for two months.  Christmas carols in December And November, too; It's no wonder we're depressed When the whole thing is through. Finally it's January; Let's sing "Auld Lang Syne"; But here comes another heartache, Shaped like a Valentine.  Suddenly it's Christmas, The longest holiday. The season is upon us; A pox, it won't go away. It's a season, it's a marathon, Retail eternity. It's not over till it's over And you throw away the tree.  No, it's not over till it's over And you throw away the tree; It's still not over till it's over And you throw away the tree.  LW3rd
