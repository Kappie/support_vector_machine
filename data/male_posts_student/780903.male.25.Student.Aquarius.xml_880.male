Habeas Chorus 3. Scales of Justice 5. Substantial Performance 6. Scales of Justice T7. Headnotes T7. Eminent Refrain T12. Public Hearing T12. Habeas Chorus 14. Moral Hazard 17. Headnotes   Note 1: The omitted schools in the top 20, at least according to what I could find on their web sites, don't have one (the horror!).  Note 2: Can't we get a little more creative here?  Ten groups and 3 names appear twice.  Ridiculous!
