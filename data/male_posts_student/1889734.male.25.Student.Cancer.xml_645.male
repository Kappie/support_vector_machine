Bush could make three times this month in the private sector, and Cheney probably even more.  I think we should look at paying our elected officials much more, to attract really qualified people.  Imagine if each Senator made $5 million per year.  Suddenly you have the smartest, most driven private sector people considering the job.  Pay the President $100 million for a four year term.  Maybe Jack Welch would run.
