Each has its own application process, its own informational meetings / wine  cheese receptions / ice cream socials / sponsored lectures, and, most important, each has its own way of filling up 20-40 hours a week that you could otherwise enjoy.    The Legal Aid Bureau, according to the five-minute presentation they made in one of my classes, requires 20 hours a week of service from each of its members, and basically helps people who can't afford legal services.  This sounds like a great thing for people who really want some hands-on experience practicing law.  I have no interest in this.  The Board of Student Advisors helps to run the First Year Lawyering program I've talked in glowing terms about (sarcasm).  But, seriously, I think it might be cool to get some experience teaching legal writing, and be a great way to spend 20 hours a week.  Plus, they pay some money.  The application process includes an edit of a deliberately-awful legal brief, some essays, a recommendation, and an interview.  The Harvard Law Review sucks approximately 40 hours a week out of the lives of its members, and has a rigorous application process involvingchecking some footnotes and writing an article about a Supreme Court case, all in a week's time after exams in the spring.  They then use a complicated algorithm involving the scores on these two things, your grades, and some factor added if you're a woman or minority, to determine who gets to write "Harvard Law Review" on their resumes.  The resume-builder in me wants to apply, just to see if I would get in.  The sane person in me wants not to.  We'll see who wins the battle.  I have a few more months to decide.
