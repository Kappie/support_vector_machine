Its not like I don't want to study, its just I can't figure out what I need to study, so basically I just randomly go through my notes, not learning or reviewing anything, and it just wastes 15 minutes of my time. Another thing is, I really can't focus because I can't wait until summer which is like 3 days away. CRAP! I NEED to study, but I can't! AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  later, bradleyJ
