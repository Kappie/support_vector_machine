On Friday, I talked to my baby for a really long time, she was tired, but I stayed up.  I also watched Fight Club on Friday, that movie is just so good.  If you haven't seen Fight Club go get it...now.  Then on Saturday I woke up and did my chores, all the while trying to call Cyndi.  After a while I went and chilled at my friend James' house.  We played a game called Fusion Frenzy on XBOX.  Very fun mingames.  I ended up staying over there all night.  I learned a lot of Japanese from Akiya, the Japanese exchage student living with James.  I really love learning new languages.  Today was so great because Cyndi surprised me at James' house, I looked like the just-woken-up-devil-monster, but it was no problem.  She took me to a Chinese restaurant and then we just hung out together for a long time.  My weekend was so great, the perfect R&R time for the long week I just had.
