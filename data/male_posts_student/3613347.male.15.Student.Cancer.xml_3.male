I didnt bother to pick it up, as i thought somebody was at home, and awake. Apparently, noone was... they were either at work or stilll sleeping.   I couldnt care less... too early for me to care. I just ignored it. Then as i was about to drift back into Dreamland, the morning call arrived again. What a bother!  This time, i waited for about 5 secs, then i slowly pulled my unwilling body up, and rushed to pick up the phone. Just as i picked it up, i could see Shu Ying opening her door and staring at me. And the person who called had put down the phone, leaving me with a tooooooooooooooooooooooot sound buzzing in my ear.  Just as i went down and started surfing the net, my mother called to say that she was coming to pick us up, to follow my father,mother and bro to Evan Lim  Co. to collect some drawings, visit my elder sister who just returned from Hong Kong, and went for breakfast, which was more like lunch. Then, finally, home sweet home....  didnt do my physics in the end.... didnt know how to do.... Oh bother... either copy or ask my SMART cousins.   Let's hope they come tomorrow, cause i have to ask them a lot on hw, and finish the potato chips, and i rented Master And Commander. Also, my mother must give them the biscuits from Hong Kong.   Cya...
