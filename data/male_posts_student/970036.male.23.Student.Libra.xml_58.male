As I put the finishing touches on a  take-home  midterm exam and conclude studying for another midterm exam occurring in less than 12 hours, my apartment has become quite an inviting place indeed. Gone are the overflowing garbage cans and piles of dirty dishes which perfumed the air with the scents of bachelor living. Clean is the living room and kitchen and even bathroom. Hell, I went so far as to actually  scrub  the bathtub and rid it of 10 months of compounded grime!  Seeing as how the take-home midterm had to be typed, it took an enormous strength of will to actually concentrate on it and not browse laxly through websites, download music and movies, or whittle the hours away playing online games. Blogging, however, is exempt from the realm of "procrastinating" as it enables me to collect my thoughts, regain my sanity, and re-double my efforts on the task at hand...  ...the task at hand  being  to locate tonight's episode of  urlLink The Sopranos  for downloading.   Currently listening to: Matthew Good - While We Were Hunting Rabbits
