But it kinda came to me out of the blue and without warning.  Now, I'm plagued with the thought of not being able to be at church for these weeks, especially now that I've gotten so involved with the service that I primarily attend.  I'm glad that a series is ending, but the new one seems just as appealing as the first.  I will miss THREE WEEKS of Sundays.  The series is only five weeks long.  I'll be here for the first and last.  It's a good job, a nice resume' builder, and I know it'll be fun to work with these people, I have no doubt about that.  Then what are you worried about?  That people are going to forget about you?  That you're going to miss out on a lot of opportunities to draw closer to God and to the friends you've made there? ... Yeah, kind of.
