Not a whole lot to recap on today, but oh well. Here it is anyhow: Science: Our group barely finished the lab on time today, thanks to Will and Kevin burning holes in our packets with heated forceps.  Spanish: "Bend it like Beckham" isn't such a great movie. I really like my cd player at moments like that. Isn't music one of the best inventions ever?  Study hall: Again, I resorted to music. And checking my email...hehe.  Social: Makenzie had her presentation today, we had several current events questions, blah blah blah. Except for the presentations, everything was routine.  I really didn't feel like going to choir today-and they still held it!! GRRR....on the day before break...they can't do that! PLUS, my sister's guinea pigs were taken home by some stupid little 6th grader when Mrs. Bartlet KNEW that I was going to take them over break. Meh, just hope they don't get killed.  I spent my Friday evening at a play. Yes, I go to plays for fun. lol. There were actually 2. The first one, titled "A Thousand Words" was the better one, in my opinion. Better acting, used a set, props, and wasn't as, peculiar, if you will, as the second one. Which was, by the way, titled "Crying Out". They both posed some of the problems and troubles people have every day, but I think the first one better represented them.  To quote Peter Sellers, "My eyes are beginning to feel tired."  Let me find a lyric here...hey-how about a double-shot of Five for Fighting, no?  "Baby there's something on my mind tonight  There's a reason to believe we almost got it right  There's a fire burning in the firelight  As we roll on tonight   There's paper promises and alibis  There is certainly uncertainty in all our eyes  But as long as you are here I'll be all right  As we roll on tonight   So you go out...I'll go on  If there's a doubt...we'll be strong  As we go on singing  One more for love my love  One more for love...   There's always blood to fill the heart betrayed  There are children being born to every house that's raised  And we're getting closer to where we got it made  As we roll on tonight   So you go out...I'll go on  If there's a doubt...we'll be strong  As we go on singing  One more for love my love  One more for love...   I'm never going to wait for anything  Never going to break for anything  Cause I am one more for love my love  One more for love  One more for love my love   Baby there's something on my mind tonight  There's a reason to believe that we got it right  And all and all you're all that's on my mind tonight As we roll on...   One more for love my love  One more for love"  -"One More for Love"  "Take off your shoes... Take off yourself  Take off your rented mental health  Take off your raincoat... settle down  Take off your nightmare and your frown  There is a place for you to go  To see another ringer in a rock show  Take my pretense for a time  Cause I want to say to you   I'm nobody without you...buddy  My long lost friend   If you're not here to hear me scream  Am I silent like a dream  Where all the dragons are my friends  Each night we meet our bitter ends  Do I need you to make me real  Like Wheeler spinning his own wheel  Quantum strings within my brain  Popping sanities insane   I'm nobody without you...buddy  My long lost friend   Not everybody has a brain  Not everybody's going sane  Not everybody wishes well  Not everybody's heaven's hell  Sometimes there's someone to blame  Sometimes a place for shame  Sometimes good's better than bad  Sometimes good's better than bad  Sometimes good's better than bad  Sometimes you're better than me   Heaven fell on herself tonight  As the devil met me in the wishing well  And in that moment I found myself knowing  That in the end it's just about you and me  Nothing smaller or larger  Though dragons are good for the soul  Nothing can be better than baring yourself for another...  Open for scrutiny, ridicule, and indulgence  Therein lies the balls, and the mind, and the heart...  As fear is truly the Mindkiller...  When nothing is left...  Everything is gained...  You see I wish I was a poet  But I know as we go round and round  Though endings are never ever happy  It's the happy moments along the way  That in the end  Make it...ok..."  -"Nobody"
