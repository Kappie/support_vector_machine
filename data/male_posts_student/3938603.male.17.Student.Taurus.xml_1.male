That is a lateral thought. The world is just like dreams. Anything can happen, because you  truly  don't know from this moment to the next what life brings. Isn't that kind of scary? Think of your heart. A single organ with a single constant. Tick tock, tick tock. Does it stop tomorrow, twenty days, forty years? When is your ticket out? When do YOU leave us? And who exactly is "us", anyway? And does any of this matter?    Maybe we're just consumer organisms taking up space with fancy concepts and over important mechanisms leading ourselves towards the cultural climax offfffff: NOTHING. The end. Death, darkness, decay, what have you... I think that life comes with the idea of the fear of the end -- we are the first organisms on earth, perhaps, and perhaps not the last, that can justify the idea of our own end, that could reasonably see that there is a final death, and nothing after.     Does fear initiate hope, or the other way around? Do we only have faith because we have to? What kind of faith is that? Look: I want to believe in God, but why am I not open to these feelings that other people seem to have? Is this some sort of lottery? How is that fair?     Jamestown is a vaccuum. I guess every place is. You get around to living in a small place for too long, and you start to regret everything around it. Stuff isn't that simple around here anymore. Let me be brutally honest for a minute: There are things to do here. There are things that make life a little more enjoyable then it once was. There are people who are worth their merit. There are people worth what you have to exert to be around them. But life here is  not  fulfilling. It's the same corner of nowhere, every day. It's the same idea that we grasp nothing withstanding from our own little community. And then, to be a pessimist, there are plenty things wrong with this city. The meat and potato mentality. Old solutions to the same problems, that were spawned under this system in the first place. No one is thinking abstractly. Everything is uniform. This is a place full of history, full of light, and life. The mountains, the forests, the lakes, the hundreds of years of culturally significant people all somehow defined by a Lucy Desi Museum and a Fenton Estate. Two buildings. Two, God Damned buildings. Is that it folks? Is that what we are? Live and be done with it?     When I dream about moving away, about growing up I guess, I dream about having somewhere to go in my free time. I dream about tight bonds with friends. Some place full of colors, and lights, and mind exercizing experience. Where is my mind exercizing experience?     This area is a funny place. Chautauqua Institution's #1 on their program list is "Building a Global Future". How exactly do you build a  Global  future, when you need a gate pass to get in your establishment in the first place?! That's the type of thing you come to learn to expect around here. Complete, lack-of-sense BS. Stuff that makes you wonder who is doing the hard thinking around here. If you're really alone in your depth.     I met some nice, middle-aged, snobby rich Missourians this past weekend at my Uncle's 30th Anniversary Cookout. They are crazy rich, like, rich enough to buy half of this city type rich, and to be honest, I don't really like them either. Now I get the idea that they're obviously the extreme -- but I think I get the idea that both ends of the spectrum are kind of self centered, self serving sad excuses for existance.    I bring this up because I get the idea that people think that the exact opposite of what they see or what they are is a good thing. Look at the clothes we wear, the music we listen to,  the goals we strive to obtain.   They're all aimed toward making money, and becoming snobby, "better" people. But these people seem no better. In fact, they seem no more intelligent, no more diligent, and perhaps less so. They might just be a bigger waste of air, a bigger dumpster of life.  It doesn't surprise me to find that the character of average people is twice as good as that of anyone spectacular, no matter what kind of spectacular they are.      I'm starting to get the idea that a middle ground is not that hard of a thing to obtain. It's just not, it's just that a lot of people don't get the picture. Maybe a lot of people act out because of some situation in their life, I don't know, but I know that it shouldn't take as much effort as it does around here. Nothing should. And maybe that's the problem. Around here, you've got to try a little bit harder, and I don't necessarily appreciate the inconvenience.    But this raps back into my larger point -- maybe we aren't meant to enjoy anything. Have you ever tried to think about something entertaining that doesn't exist -- something filled with joy and excitement that no one knows about? I come up empty. I can't seem to beacon an idea. For people who committ suicide, maybe that's the answer. Maybe life was just not fulfilling enough in itself. Maybe no matter what happened, there was no amount of happiness that could fill them.    Think of it this way. Take a random thing and say that it would bring the most joy to you, in your life. Is that it? Is that the climax? Is there no greater level than that? Or perhaps the true question, is there no greater level in life? I try to comprehend something like that; try to recognize the immeasurable joy, and put some sort of label on its feeling. But I don't know that it can be done. I think it's just so of circular. If it exists, its rare, and unexplainable... maybe for a reason.     When you think about it, in general, things are better than they usually seem. There are always blue skies and smiles waiting around the corner, and even as we grow old we learn to recognize that life is sort of story to be enjoyed rather than a game to be played. But there is no definite answer to living -- in fact, only the understanding that there are too many questions. Sometimes, for some people, good feelings come by far too little, and for those lucky ones, they come by in a much greater frequency. Personally, I think that I will find a lot more joy elsewhere, but I've stopped banking on it.    I once had the idea that if I closed my eyes and saw a car, a girlfriend, and no drama, that I would be happy. But you can't bank on it. Because if it falls through; if something goes array, then so do you. Crutches are awful, awful things.    Sometimes, it's just better to learn how to enjoy the fall, then to try to hold yourself up.
