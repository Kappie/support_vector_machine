Even though I don't have the most powerful computer in the world (P4 2.0, 768 RAM, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128 MB video card), this game  still  looks incredible. And even though it's not going to scare the living daylights out of you every 3 seconds (well, it might at harder difficulty levels; I'm playing on the easiest setting and only at the very beginning of the 4th "mission"), this is a much better source for being scared than that pathetic excuse for a movie in general called  The Village.
