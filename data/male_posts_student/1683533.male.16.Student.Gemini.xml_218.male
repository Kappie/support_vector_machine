It's so good  So I trained yet another person at work today. He is going to churchill next year, but he looks alot older than a freshman. He plays guitar and is sorta in a band with a drummer, but just lost their bassist. They were thinking about another guitar player, so maybe I will jam with them sometime. He likes alot of stuff I like, and he is going to warped this year too.  I'm excited to see  NOFX  on Conan O'Brien tonight, it should be fun...I wonder what song they will play. Perhaps  "Franco-Unamerican"?  I would assume it's from their newest cd...or maybe that song they did on Rock Against Bush vol 1?  Well, somebody put 89x on at work and they did the whole "people's choice" thing and  Green Day  apparently has been holding strong as the champion with "American Idiot"...they went up against  Korn  with their new song "word up" (a cover)...the Korn song was  so bad ....ugh...I can't believe people even voted for it...so Green Day won by a landslide, and I am happy for them. I can't wait to get ahold of their new cd. Oh yea, and their new  urlLink site  design is awesome, I love it.  Tomorrow I dont have anything to do till like 7, so if you wanna do something contact me!  "You tell me you love me, and I know it's a lie..." - The Lawrence Arms  (GO BUY THAT CD NOW!!!!!)
