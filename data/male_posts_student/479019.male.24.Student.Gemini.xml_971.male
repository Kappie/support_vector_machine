Had a beer, inhaled some nitrous oxide, and played Halo. It was a fun night...  I'm going to comment on something that might not be very politically correct. Seeing as how I work in a place that serves some extremely fatty drinks. I find it absolutely retarded when people want a sweet drink, that is healthy. Or when I see unheathily overweight people order our drinks with heavy cream, chocolate, and flavor syrups. It's the same thing when friends of mine complain about their weight and always order dessert.   To be honest I see more women fall into this stupidity. I don't get women in this society that eat high fat foods, and then have personal self expectations of looking like a celebrity. Yes, society is screwed up for creating absurd ideals of appearance, but you can not play this game to begin with! However, many women who fall into the trap of buying into this are weak for not having a more positive self image. Then they are dumb for deciding to have that ice cream for dessert. And finally, they flake out on working out. So if you chose to play the game, you have ways of coming out on top. You just don't take those options. Or you chose unrealistic plans such as the Atkins or South Beach Diet...  Stupid people annoy me..  ***
