Just writing in the blog helps him so much that he will on occasion be so anxious to blog it clutters his mind with only what he is going to write.  Writing is an immense help to Tyke as you all should know.  The problem with the blog now though is its following.  If Tyke didn't have anybody read his blog he wouldn't ever write in it so it isn't like he is disappointed that a lot (or maybe not a lot but a good number) of people read his blog.  The problem is who may or may not read the blog.  The source of almost all of his angst and troubles stem from people who may or may not read the blog.  So this means that Tyke cannot write about what he truly feels and make it personal without completely destroying his relationships (or what relationship is left).  This means that his desire to blog about his depressive feelings is left unfulfilled and thus putting him into a state of emptiness and lonesomeness.  Tyke was really hoping that Dr. Phil would be online when he got home tonight but he is not, nor is anyone else so Tyke is left talking to himself on his monitor.  For a side note Tyke will divulge the details of his day to attempt to brighten his mood before delving into his soul.  Tyke got up and got all good-lookin in the morning and then his bro arrived.  Tyke chatted with him and did family stuff for much of the day but he also made a new cd that he likes as well as watched the M's finally get their 1st win.  Long overdue by the way.  The family talked about Europe plans and such and Tyke has now convinced his mom to include France in the plan.  It was originally just going to be England and Scotland for about 2 weeks but now France should be included which will make it more fun.  Tyke is most likely going to be leaving June 16th (day after everyone gets back from graduation/senior party) and will come back some time around the 4th of July.  So it will be a packed trip.  Anyway, Tyke's mom made dinner at about 3:30 and they ate it then.  At 7 Tyke went over to Dotti's and met up with Purdy to go find Dotti and her friend.  They found them and went to Refuge.  It was a pretty good message as usual but it didn't strike anything with Tyke just because he isn't a part of the drinking scene nor has he ever been.  Tyke also didn't become a Christian and then go back to his "old ways" or anything like that so it didn't really connect with Tyke but he still enjoyed it and found it uplifting to know that he is blessed with pretty strong morals (in a way at least) and strong support.  Afterwards they went back to Dotti's before heading up to Mandy's to watch some of the third Matrix and then TALK SEX WITH SUE JOHANSSON!!!!!!  Yeah, it was good.  But Amed's version is better.  Actually that's a lie.  Tyke drove Purdy back home as they listened to his new cd and then they departed ways and Tyke came home.  Tyke wasn't exactly a real funny guy tonight and just wasn't totally into everything even though he was excited to hang out with Purdy and Dotti and Mandy.  Tyke came home his usual longing self and just drove in a daze brought to him by a hole in his heart and some unwarranted self-pity that he tried to overcome.  Listening to REM's classic Everybody Hurts probably didn't make him feel any better but it made sure he realized he isn't alone with his feelings.  His problem is known far too well by others.  He just doesn't ever really get to talk about it with anyone else.  The problem with Tyke's situation is that he immerses himself in pain by his actions.  He knows one way that should be able to make him feel better as it has already worked before this year but this would require a lack of interface between the two people and that is not going to happen.  Tyke will not allow that to happen.  He just can't.  It is just so hard to have the unrequited love that Tyke has been forced to stomach his entire life.  The knowing that whatever he does he can't change anything.  No matter what Tyke does his girl is pretty much taken and out of his reach anyway.  Tyke hates the fact that he thinks he is so perfect for this girl though and how much they share in common.  You all should know who Tyke is talking about but Tyke will not say the name on here.  That would not be right.  Seriously though, how many times has Tyke fallen for a girl that is single and has shown interest in Tyke?  You can count that with a button.  0.  *buttons look like 0's is the reason for that analogy by the way.  It always seems that Tyke is falling for the wrong girl or has no real reason to have the feelings he does.  But love doesn't follow what is planned out.  Love sets its own course and it steers you where it wants to go.  So for the moment Tyke is left alone in his large metaphorical (and literal) bed thinking about how much he wishes he could know what it could be like.  Just to know.  That would be heaven.  Just to know.
