I personally think the judge in his case should ban him from getting any more children and should probably take away the ones he has now. Ashlee Simpons CD came out today, I have no urge what-so-ever to get it, but I just thought I would say its out. 'Taking Back Sunday' In On MTV.com The Leak This Week... I Have Never Heard Of Them Before, But I Will Probably Drop By And Listen To The CD Sometime This Week! Tonight Is BigBrother/AmazingRace/Summerland Night, I Have Been Waiting A Few Days For Some Good TV Shows! I Did Nothing Today... I Did The Dishes, Did The Laundry, Played On The Computer,  Thats All Folks!
