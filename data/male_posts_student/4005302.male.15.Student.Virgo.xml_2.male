So here goes!  7/22/04   whoa, i'm tired. Even though I only worked like 3 hours today, I'm totally burnt. Nothing really exciting happened today, besides me getting whooped in HORSE by my neighbor. Damn. Made a resolution last night, I'm now going to try and leave tipsfor waitresses/waiters. . . They're very unapppreciated. Joanna wanted me put her into this, so. . . Joanna is cool!!!! Yeah!!!!!  Anyway, live well, don't vote for Bush. . .  -Isaiah
