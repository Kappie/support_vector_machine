I don't usually have grudges, but I really don't like it when people threaten me.  He was marked insane a couple years ago, and even though everyone says he's cured, they probably mean it only in the legal way. Where the judges say he's legal, even though they haven't even spend 5 minutes in a room with him.  Last year he sent threats to me because I decided to take a stand when he made my cousin cut himself. He said that he knew who I was, and that I wasn't a threat.  I almost got scared, and I would have if I was an idiot and didn't know that he was just el chico loco with empty threats over aim.  And now he has joined my church and wants to come to the lockin tomorrow, after being decidedly christian. Hmm...  It has been said that the matter has been discussed and that he would'nt start anything, but it was also said that he wasn't crazy, when obviously he still needed major psychiatric help. Not the fake kind for normal people, I'm talking about the people who can be called doctors, and can perscribe medication.  I guess we'll see how it goes, I'm still confused as to why he would convert from christian so quickly.  I really don't like him, as I hate all people who threaten me.
