LOL, i was late for work cuz i was gambling in the game... somethings will never change i guess. But i did find a certain win gambling booth, so i guess its not gambling if u cant lose... :S Anyways, went to work late, my department manager closed -_-, and it was just me him and some old guy i dont talk to working, man was it boring!! Ate chef boyardee beef ravoli for dinner, felt sick 15 mins later, worked it off by the end of the shift.  Got home, more of the same stuff, slept for work...  Saturday: Woke up at 8:40 to get rdy for work at 9!! >. I got home, did some sc/msn/ShenmueII and went to sleep.  Today:  ALL DAY... sc/msn/ShenmueII... Well i watched "Not Another Teen Movie", kinda funny, but that was it.  I was too lazy to go to ball, too lazy to go wit my parents to my grandmas, but i have no regrets.  Oddest thing happened tho, outta nowhere some guy added me to his msn.  I accepted, asked who it was, and asked if it was a joke.  Turns out the guy who added me was really looking for his friend, and they both live in Australia.  Usually i delete and block right away, but i talked to him.  Here's what i know: he's 17, dropped outta school to work at MickeyDs to help mom wit bills, was on vacation wit his gf and his mom.  He and his gf were both there, sometimes switching who i was talking to, they're both really in love, and are getting married in 4 years (they invited me to their wedding ^.^).  The guy wants to own a recording company and the girl wants to go into interior design.  then i added the guy's gf and they had to go... I also found out that a friend of mine has a crush on a former crush of mine.  We had a very enjoyable convo about alota things and he went out... That was pretty much my nite...  Well Martha leaves tmr, im very sad... tho i wish her the best.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you... :D Have Fun!!!
