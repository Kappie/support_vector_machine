Getting up at about 08:00 I was in perfect time. I had a shower, ate some serial (Shreddies this morning), and talked to  urlLink Megatrobe  on MSN for a bit. I looked up the way to Rob’s house, and reckoned it would take me about 40 minutes to get there on foot, so at 09:20 I set off. I arrived at 10:03, so my estimate was pretty good.  urlLink Megatrobe  and  urlLink Deutsches  were already there. Needing only to wait for Steve, Rob and me started a game of chess. Steve then arrived and we all started a game of Star Wars Episode II Monopoly. That took a while, and was even quite frustrating when I didn’t actually land on any properties for at least 15 moves. By the time I started getting lucky, most were bought, and so I think I ended up only buying one straight from the board (as well as a Station, (or star ship in this version)). I had to trade and buy the rest from others for ridiculous prices. I never collected a whole set :( But I wasn’t first out.  urlLink Megatrobe  was out first, then Steve. Then me, and after a bit more playing, Rob and  Dave  declared a draw. During the final moments of the game, I played Connect 4 with .  Megatrobe . And I lost. :(   Anyway, during the game of Monopoly we stopped for lunch in the garden, whilst watching the dog try to make out with an old rag. Or at least that’s what Rob reckoned he was doing :) Lunch was pretty good, Sausage rolls, steak pies and crisps. I wasn’t so keen on the pie, so I fed the last bits of mine to the dog :)  After Monopoly we played on the Gamecube. Everyone else had one at their own home, so were obviously much better than me. But I soon got the hang of it. I never was much good at computer games though. So, after this we watched a bit of ‘The Office’, a rather good comedy series, and me and Rob continued our chess game. And I won! But only because I promoted a pawn to a Queen, which I had previously lost to the enemy queen, which was immediately taken. Although Rob wasn’t keen on this promoting rule, but that’s how I always play. This no doubt won me that game. I wouldn’t have stood a chance otherwise.  Then some more Gamecube was in order, on which I slowly improved, but still no match for the others. And then finally we had a game of Trivial Pursuit, Genus Edition. (Not Genius Edition, as I earlier read it). We didn’t quite finish it, as  urlLink Dave  needed to go home about half way through, and soon after me and the others left, but not before Steve won.   Steve gave me a lift home, and I arrived at about 18:50, 9 and a half hours after I left this morning. Not being too hungry, I only had a raw carrot, an apple, a banana and a slice of toast for dinner. Then I turned the computer on, and started blogging.  What a good day. :) We may go to London on Saturday, although this is not for certain yet. Possibly go to the British Museum.  Bye for now.   Weather:  Sunny, hot. Now slightly cloudy  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves  Listening to:  Monty Python soundtrack  Watching:  The Office, Crimewatch and Little Britain later  Confused about:  The chances of not landing on any properties for ages in monopoly  Annoyed with:  My luck  Mood:  Good, a bit tired
