Just the though that I will not see my girlfriend for a month kills me on the spot.It has been probablity the best few months of my life even though I was going through hell and back at work.  I have left some stuff for her to pick up in the kitchen area of my office... Coffee, the coffee machine, tins, pasta all sorts of things.  I want to be back to wherever she lives and leave with her but I a man of the world and that will be difficult. I guess I just have to wait and see what happens.  By the way I am writing this lines from my now former office... this is the last time that I sit here.... My office mates gave me a card to wish me luck... I wish them luck too.  Mood: even... but looking good as the holiday are just there.....
