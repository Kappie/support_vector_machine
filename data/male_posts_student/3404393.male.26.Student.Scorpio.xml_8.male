By helping others to be aware of this problem, and how serious it is, I hope to counteract and stifle the spreading of this epidemic.  If you have a particular situation to share, have comments of this topic or just think I am totally off the wall (that's okay - it won't be the first time you've been wrong) then let us all know by posting here.  I hope to hear from you!;)  Jonathan
