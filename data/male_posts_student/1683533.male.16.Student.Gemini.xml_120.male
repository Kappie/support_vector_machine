I liked this alot even tho it was uncomfortable because it reminded me of the summer, and that the cold was finally gone (I hope).  I realize how close summer is now and I am excited.  Like two more months >_  Spring Break gave me lots of sleep.  Today was the last day to sleep in, and I slept in till 3.  Once this AP test is over with, it will be smooth sailing.  I am also relieved cause I dont have math homework.  yes!!  I have to catch up in math tho, I slacked off as soon as I got my report card cause I did so well, so I stopped doing homework again....stupid I know....  If I get a band practice for tomorrow my week will be full, the first time that has happened in awhile.  Here is what I would be looking at: Monday- Band practice  Tuesday- Review foir AP test after school and seeing  Kate  Wensday- Another After school review  Thursday- work: 5-8  Friday-work:4-10  I get my first paycheck this week, and I am excited, I really want the money I am so glad I got a job, now I can easily pay my phone bill, and I can start saving up for some real hot shit. Perhaps a PA system?  Sounds good.  Suicide Machines concert this saturday, and I just confirmed that Marty wants to go and can go if he can ride with me.  All I need to do is get my ticket and I will be ready to rock.  Then on May 1st there is a 9miles2go concert I want to go to, at that concert I guess they are releasing their new EP with the song   urlLink "Bitter Ending"  .  So, I would also like to go to that concert.  Well, I am just gonna relax and savor my last day of Spring Break.  Peace.
