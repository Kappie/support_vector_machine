What physics papers have had the greatest impact? Sidney Redner attempts to answer that question by looking at the citations of all journals in the Physical Review Journals since 1893. He  urlLink ranked the top 100 papers  based on their 'impact': the number of citations times the average age of the citations. Einstein's Relativity papers, which were not in Physical Review journals, are the most stunning absence. 'Fan Favorites' are there -  urlLink Einstein  does make the list for the  urlLink Einstein Podolsky Rosen  paper.  urlLink Feynman ,  urlLink Dirac ,  urlLink Bethe ,  urlLink Wheeler  are on the list.  urlLink Stephen   urlLink Hawking  does not make the list. Yet Nobel Prize winner Walter Kohn, who is virtually unknown to the general public, is an author on five of the 100 papers, including the top two and one of the top 15 'hot' papers. The paper goes into the statistics of the citations, a fascinating area in it's own right. Some papers make an immediate splash, while others might wait 50 years before their importance becomes apparent. The vast majority die a quick and quiet death. It's tempting to wonder if Redner's paper conclusively proves  urlLink Sturgeon's Law ."   Having read quite a few physics/astrophysics journals in arXiv, the wonderful free journal where this publication came from, it was very interesting to see an article that didn't exactly further a study of science, but rather rank, almost like an ESPN show, the "best" physics papers of the last 110 years or so, using a scientific method. Very interesting, and I'd recommend that anyone read that article. As a matter of fact, if you're interested in science at all, be sure to browse through arXiv whenever you get a chance, there's always something new + interesting there :)
