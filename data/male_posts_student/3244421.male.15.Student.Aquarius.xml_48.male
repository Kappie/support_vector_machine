There is nothing new except for Marching Band Camp UGH!!!  : (  We go from 7 in the morning to 12 noon.  Then take a break untill 6, and go from 6 to 9 It sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im so freaking tired!!!!!!!!  I hate marching band camp......................it pays off i guess once we start going to the games.   The main reason i hate it is the fact that it screws with my social life........I was supposed to go to the Village with Alexa, Alex, and Linz, but No!!!!!!!!!!! I had band camp so i couldn't go!  It made me mad.   Thats all for now!  Peace out!  (oh and P.S. Tubas are better than saxes *cough, derek, cough..........sneez*)  Eric
