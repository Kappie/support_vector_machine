The teacher seems to be a good guy.  I hope the class is like his last name, Holladay.  The most gruesome aspect is the price of the text...$100, not like I am surprised.  But the real bad thing is that it's a new book so I am forced to buy new!  I hate that!  Ohwell, just ate dinner, going to go take some Klonnopin and go to bed while watching Scream2.    Preview for tomorrow:  New Computer Arrives!!!!
