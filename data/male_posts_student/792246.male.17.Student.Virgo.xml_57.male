I know I didn't....I mean wouldn't.  No Rocky tonight....too unrealistic. But let's make plans to go to the next one, in two weeks I assume.  Life is funky.....kinda like chicken.  Two men walk into a bar. The first says, "I'm going to order a drink.". The other says, "Okay." Then a mysterious man in a black coat comes and kills them both.  The End    Once again I'm disturbed by how much my humor is stagnant.
