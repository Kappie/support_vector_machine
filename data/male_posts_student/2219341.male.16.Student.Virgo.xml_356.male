WOW !  i've always loved the alto part for songs.  it sounds sooo cool... and even better when they sing it.  its great... i could just listen to an alto all night... sigh.  i love singin with altos too.  tenor and alto parts sound so cool together cuz they're so close in harmonies.  whew... i just love it.  ok enough of that.  i'm feelin very lonely.. probably why i'm talkin bout strange stuff like how sexy altos are.  hahaha.  everyone i usually talk to has gone to sleep.  David Thomas is too busy with his poker... ha!  no crazy funny convos tonight.  church tomorrow...  YAY !  then cookout at the Brodies and i think a senior high devo later.  it shall be fun.  i'm listenin to Kellie Coffey's new version of Luther Vandross's "Dance With My Father"... sad song.  it makes me cry ((again probably cuz i'm in a strange mood.. oh well and i'm too sensitive)).  but it really is sad.  it reminds me of my grandma.. she's so sad after losing grandpa... its been 6 months.  but she's still so sad.  i know i remind her of him.  its freaky how much i look like him when he was young.  and i play piano by ear... just like him.  i even have the first piano he ever owned... the one that the San Francisco Conservatory of Music gave him.  its a beautiful upright piano.  i love it.  i played "My Heart Will Go On" for grandma on it when she was here.  she was in tears afterwards... i shouldnt have played that song but she asked me to.  when i was done she looked at me and said "That piano still sounds beautiful." and then she broke down.  poor thing.  there's no way i can understand how that feels.  to be married 45 yrs and then lose the one you love.  its beyond me.  but the devotion she showed to him over all those years touches me.  love is so beautiful.  i could see that beauty in them... just like i see it every other couple.  its so lovely.  makes me shed some tears.  i cannot wait to find the person i will spend the rest of my life with.  its weird to think about it... but somewhere out there is the person God intends for me to marry.  she's out there somewhere... just waiting.  gives ya somethin to live for.  it gives  me  somethin to live for.  goodnight kids... sleep well.     my iTunes  >>   urlLink Dance With My Father
