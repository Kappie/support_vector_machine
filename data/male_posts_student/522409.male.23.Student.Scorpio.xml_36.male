She showed me her textbook while we were home for Thanksgiving.    Now textbooks are technically supposed to be filled with fact upon which you can formulate your own opinions, and through which your professor can teach you all that is known to be true and theorized to be true, and debated over, and whatever else.    But in order for honest opinions to be formed, honest facts need to be presented.  The first line in a certain chapter in that textbook... this is not an essay, mind you...  is as follows:  "There is nothing inherent or natural about free trade."  I read it, and looked further, hoping to see, "...in our opinion."  I did not find that.  I found instead an elaboration upon this theme.  In order to teach a subject and have students for their own educated opinions, one must start with fact, no?  Evidently not.  The author of this extended opinion essay (which is all that book can be classified as now), evidently doesn't have any moral misgivings about disguising his or her opinion as fact for the purpose of educating students.  This troubles me deeply.  To say nothing of how troubling that one particular line is...  "There is nothing inherent or natural about free trade."  So tariffs are naturally occurring?  They fall from the sky, like rain?  So old alchemic practices should be revised to include tariffs as one of the base elements?  I don't get it?  When you import something, at what point does it absorb tariffs from the atmosphere surrounding it?  This author (or these authors) have purposely deceived students of international economics.    Free trade  IS  natural.  Tariffs aren't natural.  Free trade is the basic form of trade.  Saying that free trade is unnatural is akin to saying chocolate milk is milk in its most natural form.  Sure!  From chocolate cows!  Of course!  Cripes, people.  Open your eyes and ears, because people like this are writing your textbooks and your kids' textbooks, and they're teaching their opinion as fact from the pulpit of their lecterns.  Be aware, read the fine print, and don't let anyone tell you that taxes are naturally occurring phenomena.  If you believe that, you deserve to be paying 60% of your gross income, or whatever they want to take from you eventually.  Have a wonderful day.  It's beautiful here in Boston.  I think I'm going to run on the beach.  See ya.
