I've got a ton to do, we're leaving for Boone today, I've got to: take the trash to the dump, wash my mom's truck by hand (she insists on that even though most car washes are brushless now), take my dog to the vet to board him for the weekend, go to Walmart for a few things, get a haircut, sign papers for the camp, vaccuum out the truck (dog hair), and pack. Have to be done with all of that by the time I have to get my haircut, which is at 1pm. I have two hours to do all that. aiee, it will never get done....
