I hate it. i havent even started. Where got such project tell us to do a website on SPA?   SPA lehz! How I know about such thing. Damn that stupid subject.  Today bascially never go school cuz happily dont feel like going. Slack at hoem whole day doing nothing. Only until now have I started to do my proposal but found out that I need some material in order for me to start. Shit!!! I only got 1 book on Spa with me. I got to go to library tomorrow. Luckily tomorrow is 9 am to 1 pm de lesson so got alot of time... :P But it seems that TP de library doesnt have what it takes for me to complete my proposal. Got to make a trip down Tampines Library tomorrow.   Anyway... I need to get on a diet. I need a haircut. I need a Thumb Drive. I need money. I need the special someone who isnt with me now.   11 days more... :D
