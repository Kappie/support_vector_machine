Dennis is a 27-year-old mortgage broker from West Nyack while Erika is a 25-year-old wedding planner from Piermont. According to CBS, Dennis broke off the engagement after Erika went tandem skydiving naked with her instructor. No word on whether any peanut butter or chocolate was involved.  This was actually my favourite team to win. Sadly, they are eliminted cause of Dennis' nice guy attitude. Erika is so bloody stupid to lose herself a guy like this!
