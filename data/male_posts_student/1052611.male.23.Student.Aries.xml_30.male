However, I have been pretty nostalgic in the past few days remembering the good old days of college and bangalore. Maybe because delhi still doesn't provide me the same home feeling as I used to have in these two places. The tragedy of my kind of life is that we keep on moving, changing places and in the process, go far away from the great friends we make. Time once gone never comes back, but I am happy to say that I spent the best days of my life so far during IIT and Bangalore and I am proud that I have such great friends. A big thank you to all of you my dear friends ... Hail friendship and hail Shakti for being so much more lucky than Sanjay.
