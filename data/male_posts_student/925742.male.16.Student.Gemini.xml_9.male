At least with the auto shotty (lovingly dubbed the n00b stick) one had to actually move around to find and kill people.  With the AWP all you need to do is find a spot where you can't be seen or where people can't see you from far away and camp!  Weeeee, ain't that nifty??  Reason number 4: That one chatty bitch who always says you hack but you don't.  This is for the non-hacking half (all -skill) portion of CSers.  Reason number 3: Multiple AWP using team-stacking whores.  Reason number 2: Corrupt admins that fucking ban and TKPunish you even though you don't fucking hack.  AND REASON NUMBER ONE: Hackers.  I hate those fuckers.  They give us non-hacking all skill CS players a bad name.  I need to take my Rage-Away pills.  I think there's a vein about to pop in my neck.
