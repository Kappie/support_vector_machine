The major symptoms that seem to be left are just an overall lethargy, runny nose, and hacking cough. I really, really wish my lungs had some kind of DVD-ish "eject" button so I could just toss all of this crap out at once.  Sure, it'd look like a bloody ball of three quarters digested lipids, but hey, when you've gotta get it, you've gotta get it.  So I'm going to be at 8:30 like a good little geriatric so I can hopefully roll into he--er, work tomorrow.
