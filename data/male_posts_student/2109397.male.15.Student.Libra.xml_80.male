If he can't change to daycamp I might still go if Derek does, but Lopey and I was gonna go together and it sounds as though that shant not work out this year. I might do the "Professional" training wherever the fuck it is, and however the fuck much it costs.   Why do I do this when I don't even give a FUCKING damn if I make the team. SOMEONE TELL ME.
