Too soon maybe, but I've allready repeated my title, so I better start explaining it. Life , imo, has developed the incredible abillity to trip you up when things are going ok. We all aim for supreme 'ok-ness'. I was there damnit! I had it. And then, in one foul swoop, last monday morning, at 10:50am, it was gone. What are you left with? I can't answer that. What I do know, is that tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life. No really, the end result of monday's debacle is made known. Then, maybe, I can finaly start to move on. *sigh* Yes, that's how I feel. But you know what? This place aint so bad, it's just the waiting that becomes a bit much...
