I'm inspired to turn that into a whole song.  This one ain't no parody song, but e-mail me if you want the mp3.  I don't know if this works or is just throwaway.    "Land of the Brilliant But Modest"   They're reading books In the cover of darkness Solving equations In the black of the night Submitting papers Under names that have been falsified Saving the world But hiding out  It's the land (land, land) of the brilliant but modest Where the credit's shared, and no one wants fame It's the land (land, land) where they're all deferential And no one cares if you know his name  The trophy sits But there is no engraving Reporters come But no one will talk You ask for help And there's a line of willing geniuses You slip and fall They pick you up  It's the land (land, land) of the brilliant but modest Where the world gets changed, and that's all you want It's the land (land, land) where you don't need the credit It's in your heart; no reason to flaunt  Though it'll go into history You're okay if your name is a mystery Though what you're doing is stunning work You're more than just a cunning jerk Who wants his name in the news  It's the land (land, land) of the brilliant but modest Where the world says thanks, and that's all you ask It's the land (land, land) can somebody point me You, yeah you, the one in the mask.
