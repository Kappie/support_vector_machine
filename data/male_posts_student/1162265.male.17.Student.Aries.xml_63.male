Nia was like "Did that white man just spit on our car?" and her friend Nicole was like "Oh yeah, he must looove niggers!" that was pretty funny, but my mom got all Betty Shabazz on them, and was like "Look how your defining yourselves!" but she thought it was pretty funny to.  Had to of been there.  Then yet another black reference, or maybe moment of truth would be a better word.  We are starting to working on our slavery project in History.  I think Cotter did this for two reasons A.) It's not covered well in the book.  B.) There are three black people in the class (inclusive) and I seriously doubt anyone else knows anything about slavery but us (and Cotter), so I assume it's to spread knowledge.  I wanna see how people handle it.  Anyway, I'm pulling away from the point.  I was sitting in our Louis and Clarke group, and suddenly I was like "Shit, this is me.  This is the story of my ancestors and profound jumping the broom and all that jazz."  I guess maybe it's odd because I don't relate this stuff back to people who are related to me most of the time, but this is something I know I had my family knee deep in.... not like anyone cares.  Has anyone noticed how being spontaneous is something that can happen?  I tottally didn't think it true, but I dived into a situation I tottally wasn't ready to face before I had random junk food in my veins.  That was pretty weird, and I felt kinda like an ass, because I'm doing a typical guy thing, which totally ruins my "60% Gay, 40% Fat" persona..... Only a few people actually understand what   I mean but it's really not important.  Then there was that GAIA thing, A-laad, those are some devoted peoples.  I mean these guys go pretty far to protect the local enviornment, feels a helluva a lot more involved then Amnesty is.  Like Amnesty is like "Ayatollah Khomeni, stop killing people please, or we'll send you another nice letter!" but Gaia is like "People dump trash in the river, we're gonna write them up, and harass them, and make them feel stupid!"  Oh well, it was kinda weird how it was mostly underclassmen.  Neema ran the whole meeting, because none of the upper echelon were there.  It was a pretty nice club though, a lot of kids I don't know all that well, yet I know all of them.  Then I got home and logged onto the Esperanto "Babilejo" that was pretty boring since people talk about nothing really interesting.  All I did was greet people, and listened to them argue over grammer, it was rather odd considering I couldn't translate half of what they were saying.  Like some of the stuff people say way to much crap for example- T LuisBr Mi iris al paltalk, shajnas simpatia retejo.    T LuisBr mi nun devas forii, horo iri dormi. is al la amikoj.    Long entry.
