I was watching Fox  News this morning and the posted a quote from the leader of this group of  womyn in regards to Arnuld and Clinton. "the difference is Clinton was so brilliant" So, I guess only smart people  can grope womyn and it is a crime if you is dum. Nice double standard. What  a push back for the womyns movement.
