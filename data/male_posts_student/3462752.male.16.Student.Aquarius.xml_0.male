Apart from the fact there is no design at all on this page. Its just a CRAP template provided by geocities. What a friggin waste of hyperspace! The website consists of just... wait for it... 53 words. And one picture. Which she didnt even upload herself Its one of those preuploaded pics, you can tell because geocities. use those "Corbis.com" pictures. Way to go. Note the quote on her friend "Charc's" site: "Thanks to Sarah for helping me with my links! :)" She couldnt even make the links herself, on a TEMPLATE! a TEMPLATE for goodness sakes! She didnt even have to copy the HTML code or anthing! This girl never even saw any HTML code. I bet she doesnt even know what it is. Pah. Webmasters the world round spend hours making the web a nice, sophisticated PHP and HTML orientated place, (like my website)... (plug plug) and then it gets polluted by this waste. Traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaashhh  You dont like what I just said? Bite me. Or post a comment. The choice is yours. Moowaha
