They rape and pillage my account like rabid visigoths (which, unlike normal goths are quite uneffiminate and carry clubs instead of hanging around in them) and "withdraw" a multitude (like Jesus Fish and Loaf Crowd sized) of "fees" on a regular basis. For the priviledge of holding on to  my  money these delightful people were charging me upwards of   a hundred and sixty freakin' dollars  a year. SO THEY COULD MAKE INTEREST OFF MY MONEY AND NOT PAY ANY TO ME!!  FTS: Fuck that shit.  So I signed up with PC banking. As of next week I'm transferring all my bills and shit over to this new account. Unique concept - they're paying me more interest (TEH SEXAY!) and I get points for groceries. It's tantamount to bribery. I love it.  Got an email from an old friend today, just as I was searching for his email address to drop him a line. It's like I'm in some John Cusack movie.  Pardon me while I go rearrage my videogames in autobiographical order.
