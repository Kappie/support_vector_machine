Planet is taking up a lot of my time so I am all... busy.  Went into town with Susie yesterday, which was quite cool. We ended up not actually really going into any shops (save Ottakars and Café Roma), but we still managed to fill about 5 hours just walking around. Woo. It rained though so we had to go under a tree, then we realised there was lightning, so we went to the café bit of the Lido. 'Tis all fun. Saw about 30 people I knew in town, including Jazz and Chris from GYWO who I seem to see EVERYWHERE. Ah well. 'Twas cool anyhow.  ...work experience in Duck Son + Pinker starts tomorrow. Ee. Oh, and school concert is on Thursday. Off to Holland Tuesday week. Ee.  Quote of the day: "Only the lonely... There goes my baby, There goes my heart... She's gone forever."
