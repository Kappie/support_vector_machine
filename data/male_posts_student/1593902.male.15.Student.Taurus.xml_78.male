But you seem to have a touch of those qualities—enough to make Katie Holmes your celebrity match.   Despite her fame and complete cuteness, you're sure to notice her down-to-earth demeanor that demands friendship before romance. A product of catholic girls school and strict parents, Miss Holmes didn't have much time for boyfriends growing up. This probably explains why she's still a little shy and reserved.   But there's plenty of enthusiasm behind those deep blue eyes. Katie's idea of a good time is a night at the karaoke bar where she transforms herself in to a sing-along diva and then blushes about it afterward—so warm up your backup voice.   There's more substance than flash when it comes to this natural beauty. Katie Holmes is the innocent alternative to all those Hollywood bad girls out there. So even if you can't catch her, maybe you can find someone just like her
