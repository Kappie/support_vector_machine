Love is mainly why i am this way...My heart sayz i have a chance...my mind sayz i dont. I dont know which one to follow. It lookz like itz goin nowhere...i realized that nothing is probly gonna fuckin happen...nothing is gonna fuckin change the way thingz r...nothing is gonna make me happy. I feel pretty damn close to suicidal...but not that close. I just really hate my life...I hate the way thingz r goin...I hate the way how nothing goez my way...I hate the fact that nothing is probly gonna change...Today is basically the worse day i have had since the monday following homecoming. I feel like I dont belong in dis world anymore...ill cya guyz lata...maybe
