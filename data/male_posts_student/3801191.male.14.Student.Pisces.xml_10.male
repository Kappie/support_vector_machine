The dude with the vulcan eyebrow, yes you...come on up here  At an 8 hour torture session?   Congratulations, here's your prize...*slaps mal with a trout*...  Anyway...yep, just went to hell and back, literally...  Lets see...how shall i put this? Imagine this...  The sun beatin down on u so hard that your skin threatens to peel off...  Your boots fryin, and u wishin that you didnt listen to your OTC's advice and use instantshine to polish em...  And yes, add this to the mix, a butch with the same name as one of your best friends shouting drill orders at you...and round after round of punishment...  Yes, every frickin bone in my body aches now...and my shoulders feel like i just took up a full-time job as a coolie. My muscles scream and burn whenever i move now...man, now i know wat gollum feels like...  On top of that, ive got this dull, throbbing pain in my head...and im frickin scared that im gonna get hit by another mental block...  ARG...  At least its over now, and i can take time to relax...and write a few shout outs;  Mei: AAAAAAAAAH, leavin me al alone...*sobs*  Mal: One word...and youre skrewed...  Lye Kuang: Fuck u  Brandon: Do not, i repeat, DO NOT drop the flagpole during drills...  Yes, one liners...but i dont care now, do I?
