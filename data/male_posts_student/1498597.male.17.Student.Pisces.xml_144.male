Speaking of editorials, did you hear that my friend and Blog Superior  Nikolas Brown  , and thats how I spell his name (I think he likes it) has been accepted into our school's/prsion's/our personal hell's/our "workplace's" newspaper?  Well, he has and I just that it deserved some mention.  I'm kinda surprised that I am on my third blog today, but i have a lot to talk about!  Of course, this being the weekend and all, I have more time to blog.  The number of new blogs will prolly be reduced to two (2) per day or less...or worse...none!  Hopefully that is not the case though, right?  What else can I talk about in this blog?  Oh, how about I tell you a bit about my weekend?  Well, if you are a reader of  Nick's  blog, then you may already know about our history project on WWI/II.  Well, I'm glad to announce that I got together today with my friends  Eddie, Derek, Robbie, and Eric  today and with everyone's help, finished the video portion of our project!!! In the video, I played various parts such as  Hirohito , Emperor of Japan,  Winston Churchill , Prime Minister of England, a  Japanese citizen , and an  unwilling kid  refusing to be drafted (very punk rock!).  Last night, I went with  my sisters  to a karaoke party held by  my oldest sister's  boyfriend  Mark .  Not only was it fun to sing, but I got a 99 (the machine scores your performance)!!!  Future contestant of American Idol?  No way!!!  Someday, I want to take my friends to Punk Rock Karaoke.  I have yet to go myself.  It won't happen anytime soon, becasue I think you havta be 21 and older to go, so unless I miraculously turn 21 or a fake I.D. mysteriously falls into my hands, I'm gonna just havta wait.  I'm in no rush though, I can just as well sing punk songs for my friends anytime of the day.  Well, I've run outta things to say for now, so I think I will end this blog pretty soon.  Lets see how long I can go without creating another blog...I will just keep on typin' until I run out of things to say...Oh I'm comin' close to runnin' outta things to say....what can I talk about, what can I talk about...I'm burstin' with opinions, but right now I dunno if I can think of one...I know!  Maybe my two "Blog Buds"  Nick and Elyse  have some suggestions.  But anyway I'm now at a loss for words!  More to come...!
