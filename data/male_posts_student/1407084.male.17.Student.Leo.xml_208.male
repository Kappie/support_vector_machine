We saw Kill Bill 2, which I must say was the best movie I've seen this weekend; Anchorman, which is pretty funny but not as good as some other comedies I've seen; and Dodgeball, with Ben Stiller. I didn't like Dodgeball. It was too predictable, and Ben Stiller played a bad guy. I think he makes a much better good guy. But yeah, this weekend has been awesome.   By the way.. what happened to the blimeystudios domain? I can't access it from here, it redirects me to this page:  urlLink http://blimeystudios.triple7.biz/
