In global, my group presented a project on the Mayans and practically failed it because our leader couldn't organize everything. In math, I'm getting a B for the 3rd quarter which is great because I was originally getting an F... the last major test, I got a 94 which raised my grade alot. I think the test counted like 5x. Lunch, everyone loved the smell of my chicken cutlet w/ sweet and hot peppers on fresh Italian bread sandwich. I have to say science was the funniest since a long time. Today Mr. Benzinger turned off the lights to show us some thing about the angle of the sun with a flashlight and I hear "Thomas" in Joe's hilarious voice. I turn my head quickly to the right to see Joe's face all smooshed together. I thought I was going to die of laughter, don't you hate when you know if you laugh, you'll get in trouble... that only makes you laugh harder and it takes breath away from you when you have to keep the laugh silent. Joe you really did look like the predator. Of course he added in his famous old man orgasms... actually there someone's orgasms, I'm not going to mention who. In track, we had to run inside which is molto fun. Thank god it snowed, I hate running on that fuckin track over and over again. We'll probably run inside tomorrow also. As soon as the 3:50 bus left from the school, I relized I forgot my track shoes. Well I went back 8 at night, got my shoes and Paul's along with all of Jake's clothes mistaking them for Paul's. But let's rewind to when I got home. I went to Paul's, we made milk shakes, we talked about the eclipse and how we're both going on Friday, and did our science homework. Paul has been punished for a very long time because his average for the 2nd quarter was a D! So we told "OUR" parents (WOBIN and MIKE) simutaneously that Paul, my brother, got an 96.3 average in science to make them all happy. This is true! Unfortunetly, I got in trouble when they found out Paul lost his cell phone. You see I'm responsible for everything Paul owns. That's right Paul, if it wasn't for me, you'd be like jello! Ok, enough about Paul, I got home, did my homework which I'm still not done with, and read another greek myth story called "Theseus." Personally, I think it's pretty good shit. You gotta read it for yourself, I like that minotaur and labyrinth crap, it's pretty fascinating. Ok, so then I ate some cool dinner with spicy chicken, green beans and curley fries... or "CURLY Q'S!!!" - As Curly would say in The Three Stooges. Which makes me want to watch it now. What else did I do, I went to get the shoes and I listened to alot of music. I don't know why I'm telling so much information but whatever, I just type away and you read... well I don't think many people actually read this but ok! Claudia Schiffer, she's a babe! Shaaaaaaaawing. Gooooooood Night.
