After the results are released you can see many different emotions.This is the best part because when i see other people i fell good about myself for being a champion and for not being categorized as a failiure!!  For those with the joyful looks on their faces, they should be flogged in public for getting good grades or for just the fun of it.If someone scores high marks then automatically those people who scored low marks will be seen as stupid people. The best way out is for every student to form a pact where evry one of them swears by the hairs on their genitals never to score high marks again and will aim for equality. Everybody only studies a chapter of the text book and doesnt answer the questions which are irrelevant to the chapter they chose.That way everybody is guaranteed the equality of marks and standings in exams. Everyone will get a place in university and teachers will be proud for the achievements of their students. Then maybe everyone will see how pointless exams are.  Anyways, if i get high marks then i should sit in front of the computer more and if i get low marks, i should hit the books more often.  By the way, I think you are stupid.
