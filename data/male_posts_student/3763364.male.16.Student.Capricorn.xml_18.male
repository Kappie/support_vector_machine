But really, how does one define "good" or "bad"  What is bad? Something that is not good.  What is good? Something that is not bad.  Are these types of things defined solely by their polar opposites, or is it, in fact, we who decide which is which.  At some point and time, an individual decided that murder of your fellow man was against the law. Now, all of the people who murdered people very frequently were probably pretty pissed off. But that was the way it was. And murder was deemed "Bad."  At some point and time, and individual decided that marriage was a holy, and that if you were in love, you should get married, lest you live your life in sin. Now the sinners were probably pretty mad, but couples everywhere liked the idea, and such things were deemed "Good."  To Adolf Hitler, "good" or things that were "right" was his genocidal crusade. Is it all in how you look at it? Hitler thought it was a good thing, but most everybody else opposed him. Who is right and who is wrong, well, in our predominately democratic society, we would assume that the majority is, indeed, right, and Hitler was wrong. Done and done.  All in how you look at it. All in how you perceive it.  Take for example, my perception. My perception, my observation, isthat there is a woman lying in my bed as I write this. I can see her, I can hear her. Is she really there?  If someone else were to walk in the room at this very instant, they would not see her. Therefore, what I see is, one way or the other, imaginary. Isn't it? Is that how we define what is real and what is not real? What if what everyone else sees is imaginary, and I, one man out of billions, see things for what they real+ly are?  Alright, so, we have to redifine our concept of reality. I think I could safely say that reality, of all things is very much NOT NOT NOT a yes or no concept. Who's to say there are simply two sides to reality: there and not there? Well, not me!  I have come to believe that reality is a ladder. On this ladder is one hundred steps; the one hundred steps of conciousness. When you see an "aparition" or hear something that nobody else hears, you may have taken a step up or down on this ladder (perhaps even sideways!).  Indeed, when I see this woman sitting on my bed, perhaps she IS actually there, only nobody notices her but me.  In a Where's Waldo puzzle, you can never find him simply by taking a quick look. Very close inspection would reveal that he is, indeed, in the picture, but it would not appear so to the untrained eye.  Maybe she really is there, and nobody has taken the time to look.  Or maybe I'm just a frickin nut-job trying to make himself look not so nuts.   Am I a step higher on the ladder than everyone else? Is this why I can know a thing before it happens? Do I see things that nobody sees simply because they are unable?  Twenty minutes before game 7 of the Stanley cup finals, I looked at the newspaper, and I said "The Flames will lose, 2-1." I did not cheer like my friends did. They were sickened by my pessimism. It's not pessismistic if youKNOW it's going to end badly.   I'm a melting convoluted, corpuscular mess.   Can't you hear my soul, calling out, across time and space, to yours?     Despite my current thoughts on reality, I can't help but feel that everyone else is living in a dream world. They don't know what really goes on. Their heads are buried in the clouds, and they pay no attention to anything else.
