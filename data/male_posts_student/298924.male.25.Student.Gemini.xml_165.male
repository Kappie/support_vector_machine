Well anyway....the only people I talked to were J.A., Dave, and the folks I came with....I just don't like those folks man...I can't get into them....the ones who were there coulda cared less about me anyway....so it didn't make me any difference....there was a time where I woulda at least liked to have taken pictures of them....but last night I didn't even care about THAT....and I'm COOL with that...ugh...anyway....  So today was a pretty cool day....went to PD and learned about the HENT exams (Head, ears, nose, and throat)....then I went to lunch with J.A., TaTa, Doris, and Dave....we had some pretty good conversation about male/female relations, why having a son is better than having a daughter, and other things....best lunch I've had in a while....  I went to Turtles and got what up until Tuesday was the BEST MOVIE NOT ON DVD....yes people.....Boomerang is out on DVD....don't all rush to Suncoast/Best Buy/wherever you buy your DVDs at once....I also got the special edition of True Romance which means I have yet another DVD to sell to the used DVD place....I also bought Cree Summer which I am listening to right now.....Curious White Boy is the jam easily....  Anyway....J.A. told me she stayed online for a few hours and read ALL of my posts....I was in awe with that fact although I don't think I really reacted as strongly as I felt....I feel I lead a really boring life and I can't imagine how anyone could stand to read all of this mess....anyway I digress  Somehow on the ride home she and I began to discuss the appropriateness of an 80's party....think about it, 3 years ago the idea of an 80's party would be silly....but people born in the 80's are becoming adults now....nostalgia is setting in....look at the 80's revival in fashion and pop culture....before you know it Hair Bands and Leg Warmers will be back....Diadoras and BK's are already back....Leather Jackets with zippers wouldn't surprise me....  Anyway....J.A. pointed out to me that in the 90's the rage was 70's nostalgia.....in the 80's it was the 50's and 60's....call me slow for just catching on....but I don't think it will be too far fetched to see a 90's revival in 2010....and I'm here to tell you I will be in full Neon, Cross Colours, Saved by the Bell effect then!!.....  Which brings me to another point....in the car we heard "Turn This Mutha Out" by "then MC" Hammer, and he used the phrase, "in effect"....Al B. Sure (who Geoff and I concluded WAS in fact the gayest man alive in 1987) had an album entitled  In Effect Mode ....someone who is hipper to the 80's slang needs to let me know EXACTLY what "In Effect" meant and where it was derived from....  Anyway I'm going to watch Marcus Graham do some fooling....peace
