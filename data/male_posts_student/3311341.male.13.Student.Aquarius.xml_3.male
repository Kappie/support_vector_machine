And, I researched the insane difficulty weapons, which is the next difficulty. The prizes run for 4 - 13 million. The staff that you can get with 13 constant icons is about 10 million. The sword, and other stuff is about 4 million. BUT, you can't beat insane if you die. You start over... Sooo, if you lose on the last boss. Yep. But, it's worth it.  I swung on the swing for half an hour straight... Nothing else too much today. Oh yeah. My mom owes me $15, and I'm gonna get another $15 for mowing my grandma's lawn.
