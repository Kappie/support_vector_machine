I woke up immediately and my heartbeat rate increased. I felt a little bit nervous so I could not sleepagain. And the lightning stoppedme from trying to sleep again!But finally I fell asleep after the disapperance of thunder and lightning. This morning I felt I've lost all my energy. I hate thunder!    Since I did not have a good sleep last night, I cannot figure out whatis in my mind. So I need to rearrange data in my brain...  P. S. This is the first time I was scared by thunder since childhood. I know it is somehow embarrassing, but it is quite a special experience for me.
