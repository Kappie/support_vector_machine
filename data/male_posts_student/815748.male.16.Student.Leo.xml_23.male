Suprisingly, I was more persuaded to go by its NEGATIVE Globe review (titled "The Enterprise crew is still off-track) than its own preview, because the former makes it sound more interesting.  By the way, did you hear? Law resigned. I guess we'll have to go back to trials by ordeal.  One final thought: F comes before G in the alphabet of the mind.
