I'm not able to talk to people, I have to hug myself every couple of seconds and I seem either really rude or really annoying, alternately. Annoying - to Laura, or at least it feels like I am being so, not cause of anything she says or does but how it sounds in my head. Rude - to Olivia at Les Mis, who I really like but don't talk to cause I can't. *cries* I've got one of the most important exams of my life in 1 month. Damndamndamn.  I really can't think of anything to say. I'm tired, I'm ill... just... ever noticed that bad days tend to be mutual?  Quote of the day: "I want to be The first man you remember. I want to be The last man you forget. I want to be The one you always turn to, I want to be The one you won't regret."  From   The First Man You Remember   from the musical   Aspects of Love   Love, Jon Roskilly
