Eating and playing on theplay ground, driveing, FARTING! OMG! Long story. Don't ask. So about the friend thing, they are just a good thing to have. Like Jeremy.Always there to give good advice about bois. AndhowI'm not aloud to touch Drew.  I was shy once again today. Remember Josh, I met him last night? Well..I was nervous to ask him for his # or give him mine, so Jessica did it for me. I brought Jessica a snow cone for her break and picked up the number. I call and he said he needed to call right back. So he calls back. Damn this boi had such a hot voice! We talked for a bit and thats about all. I wanted to ask him out sometime next week but never did it. Shit on my part. But he says that he would call me sometime and we would set something up. Damn he's good looking.    BTW: Mistic Riverand Along Came Polly are 2 tight ass movies. I recomend them both.
