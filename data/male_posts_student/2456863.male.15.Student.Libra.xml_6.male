Today's word is cliché, and if you dont know what it means, well you'll just have to look it up.   urlLink Here  is a good place.  My joke yesterday was "the easiest way to define cliché is three letters long 'lol' "  It was great fun.  Yup so lets see what happened yesterday... I learned that I was invited to something I wasn't invited to.  Then I learned that I was invited to something I was invited to after not being invited to it, then I learned that I was going to it.  Yup so that was my night, we watched legally blonde and how to deal at Jenni's house, then went home.
