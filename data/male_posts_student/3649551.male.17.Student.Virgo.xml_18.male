It's a kind of splinter youth group called Finding the Plot. It's from the Newsboys song that I think is titled "Missed the Plot." Thelines we were looking at were something like:  Are you listening? Because we're obviously not We've forgotten our first love We've missed the plot  Basically the 'plot' we're talking about here is following Christ, as opposed to just going to church or 'just believing.' We're focusing on getting focused on the things we need to be focused on. We're focused on fellowship, studying the Bible together and forming closer relationships with each other, but we're very outwardly focused as well. In addition to the Bible studies and discussions, we're planning on serving people in the community through Habitat for Humanity, volunteering at the mission, or merely helping neighbors do yardwork. Whatever needs doing, really. By the way, I don't want to give the impression that I'm anti-church. I think I came close to doing that today, as well as in a previous post. Church is a great thing and is a wonderful way to learn, grow, and serve. It's a fantastic place to form lasting friendships and is supposed to model the Kingdom of Heaven. But going to church in itself is not enough, which is where Finding the Plot comes in. We've got to reach out to people outside youth group or church, and when I say 'reach out' I don't mean coerce into believing what we do. I simply mean forming friendships and meeting needs. I jokingly refer to Finding the Plot as 'Christians for Christ.' I just think that a lot of Christians get wrapped up in everything except  themain pointof what Jesus was trying to get us to do. They go to church, they pray, they read their Bible, but they don't associate with non-Christians. Jesus reached out to people in need, so I think I should be doing that too. Simple concept, but pretty difficult to live out.
