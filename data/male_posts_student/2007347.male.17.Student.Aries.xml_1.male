I do hope i didnt make any enemies this time, none of the others seemed to be too annoying. Hooray. now Sarah invites me to churchie mcchurch. should i go? i dont have anything better to do so i dont know. Luke was there, i dont think anyone noticed the fact that he has a bad habit of trying to have the last word. fish was funny with his coupling thing with me, i think everyone esle laughed nervously, im surprised some of those people were so homophobic, meanwhile i frankly dont care, just dont try anything on me, keep your hands to yourself boys. Simon kept himself in check this time around, good to see, hes finally hit pubity insiting hes paired with a girl for any activity, very good progress. Sarah seemed preoccupied with other people, and she called ME a Snob? well well, Enter the Hypocracy. Oh one fellow was alot fun, Josh. Yay, he wasnt happy with my choice in music. I dont know why, i mean i dont like garage rock. so i can understand that he doesnt like Korn or ICP, or Disturbed. But contrary to what he thinks, They arent Satan Worshipping whatevas but even if they are what does it matter, ive still got my head fixed on proper. And clearly i withstand "Brainwashing" as he calls it, i mean, im  a Muslim hanging with a bunch of christians, when You Dance with the Devil, You wait for the song to finish. But that got me thinking, which bands do i acutally like, because everyone seems to have preferences where the only definate for me is that i hate Rap. EMEemiemieemine! DIE DIE DIE!   So i thought about it and the results even suprised me.   (In order of genre)  Artists i Like.   Comedy : Arrogant Worms Tripod  " Harcore ": Disturbed Korn Linkin Park ICP (except tht juggalo rubbish)   Popular : Will smith Evanensence Delta Goodrem Frank sinatra (Go Old school) Ameil (Its all about Obession)   The Unknowns : Rob Dougan (You know Clubbed to Death?) Frenzel Romb John Butler Trio    Various Movie Soundtracks : Matrix (both of them) Gladiator Lock, Stock (Go James Brown) Queen of the Damned Enemy of the State Fight Club!!! Love the Dust brothers.  That looks pretty rounded to me. My Top 3 Songs  how long theyve been Up there. Clint Mansell - Requriem for a dream. About 7 months Ameil - I love You (Obession) About 2,3 months? Frankie Sinatra (i think) - Fly me to the moon. About a Year.  I mean its not that i dont like other songs, but these are the ones that STAND out that i like and listen to a fair bit. Funny how many Love related kinda things i have in the list, i supose theres no avoiding it. But seriously i RECCOMEND any of the afore mentioned to anyone.
