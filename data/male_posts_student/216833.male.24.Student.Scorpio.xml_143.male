I almost walked out on Thursday, I started crying and was so utterly depressed that I couldn't even hold on to myself.  I just felt so out of place at zales. Michelle, the 'fill-in' manager talked me into giving it some more time. I have to say, she was right. I can totally do this.  I've already sold a few high priced items and I feel totally comfortable talking to random people. I just had to get in that groove i guess.   We were supposed to go up to Fort Bragg and hang out in the redwoods but one of Mimi's workers didn't come in and so she had to go into work for her. Damn that cunt. Poor mimi cried as she laid her head on my chest in the kitchen. I just held her. I started to cry, this has been a change for sure. It's one of those good/bad situations. I know we will find 'normal' in there somewhere.  Oh, I wish I would have taken the time to tell some stories of the week. I have a few for sure.   current mood:  uncomfortable current music: sunny day real estate
