What have I done?  I have formatted my old hard drive and started fresh, installing every application I use on a regular basis.  What's the result of this?  A great feeling.  I suppose it's the feeling similar to buying a new car.  Everything about it is well tuned, in excellent condition.  If you spend a lot of time using the computer, you know what I'm talking about :-)  So today was ok after all.  Last night I spent most of my time in bed listeing to  urlLink Coast to Coast AM  and wondering if my parents would get mad if I got up one more time to get something to drink.  The reason why I was worried about this is because I didn't get to bed until around 2 am.  I listened to Barbara Simpson interview a guy who wrote several books about random secrets.  Some examples they talked about were the ingredients in Coke, KFC chicken, and stuff like that.  It was really interesting.  So I guess that could be one of the reasons I couldn't get to sleep.  My mind was just too stimulated.  I spent most of today just sitting around, however.  But later this afternoon I started to format my old 6.4GB hard drive.  I put Windows 2000 on it and all my favorite applications.  Only took me a few hours and I'm glad I did it.  I think one of the reasons why I got through it was because I would constantly go upstairs and watch this interesting History Channel (or might have been TLC) program about robots.  I guess that kept me from going amazingly bored.  Tomorrow basketball camp begins.  I hope that it's not as bad as I remember it being last year.  From what I remember my feet were really killing me from all the running and my legs equally sore.  We'll just have to see how it goes.  I'm actually excited for basketball next season.  I'm more into it now, I guess.
