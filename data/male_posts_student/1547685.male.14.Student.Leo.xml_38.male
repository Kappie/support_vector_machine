I went to PV, Matzatlan, and Cabo San Lucas which were all pretty much tourist areas in mexico. My favorite memory was probably seeing the adults drink beer on the back of a truck during a tour. When we pulled up to another truck that was on the tour we were seeing who had drinken more from the bottle. Then both tour guides held up the beer and shouted, "Que Pasa" to the cops at a security check point. The cops turned on their alarm for a sec and then turned it off. It just so happened that our tour guide knew the cop so that was good. Things i bought from mexico were sunglasses that turn color in the light and then turn back when removed from the light. I also bought a silver ring and a pair of shorts that change color in the light. At the end of the cruise we drove back up but made a short visit to UCSB to check it out. Then we drove all the way back home....... On Thursday i went to the County Fair before it opened and got a job as a vendor in a funnel cake place. The pay is ok but its the EXPERIENCE that counts. So as of now ive been really busy working 5-7 hours a day selling funnel cakes. Yesterday, after work i went to the A's and Giants game at Net Work Associates in Oaktown. It was an exciting game and actually went into extra innings but in the end the A's won. Those stupid A's couldnt hold a 4 run lead in the 9th inning so they made us sit threw another 2 innings. The outcome wasnt to good but atleast they won today and ended up taking the series 2 games to 1. The highlights were seeing the die hard fans rooting for their team and seeing the other ppl yell at them to "sit the f***" down. There was even a fight going on right in front of our eyes and since i was with my church group we sat and shook our heads. I said, "atleast the giants fans are tougher then the A's fans jkjkjk. So that has been my summer so far........ hopefully if i have time, ill post a pic of the fight during the ball game.
