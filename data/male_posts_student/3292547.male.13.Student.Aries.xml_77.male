It kinda is all the same and switching from one place to the next gets irritating. It's usually at a good part too. He did a little better in this book. Instead of having like 4 long chapters then a switch it's more 2 short ones. That makes it easier and keeps your attention.  Several reviews I read said that you should skip all but the main parts about Rand, but I find that the story centers around everyone else just as well as him, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, I also could be getting "burned out" on it, but oh well. Talk 2 ya later. Bye. (Again)
