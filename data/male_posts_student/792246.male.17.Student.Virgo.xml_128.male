That quote, a card from her, an e-mail address, and the knowledge that I'll probably see her in December are the last things for me to hold onto.  I knew for two (mostly) wonderful years that this day would come. And it's here. She came to my house to say goodbye to me and drop some things off, we had a very awkward goodbye, she left, and I went into my room and cried.  It was then that I realized I was losing so many people. And not to make anyone feel bad, but I will be missing Claudia the most by far. I formed a closer connection with her than anyone before, excepting my mother. I geniunely feel as if I'm losing an older sister I spent my entire life with.  I'm not prepared for this at all.  I originally was going to write lame little comments to everyone who was going away, but that was too depressing and just sounded like yearbook signings.  Fuck...I'm going to miss you guys. Please keep in touch with me. And give me your e-mail addresses if I don't have them.
