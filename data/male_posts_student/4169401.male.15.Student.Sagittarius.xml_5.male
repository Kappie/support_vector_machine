I didn't care much at that time and just don't give a damn. But all this while, I can't forget her. Just recently, I saw her on the bus. She was talking to another guy by her side from the same school as her. I thoT he was her new steady. But she saId he isn't. I was happy as she still cares for me and ask how I've was doing. I starting messaging[sms-ing] her and ask her about her health. As she always have gastric problems and she always misses meal.          Soon, i ask her to go steady again. I told her i wanna take care of her. She gave me a reply that she need to complete her O level first. I accepted and told her i was willing to wait. However, i admit i was impatient. A few days later, i ask her for her hand again, she then told me she was attached. I was angry and frustrated in my heart for her to keep this from me.           I was very angry but I didn't want her to be sad. I told her that i was fine and ask her to rest assure that we will still be friends. I don't know what to do now. Feeling depressed and sad lately. Just hope something in my life will change as thingts aren't getting well lately.
