I was just expecting just kind of the norm, either sit around, and watch the game without much happening, or go wild and have a great time. I never know what to expect really, but either way I have a good time, and I was happy to spend time with him because we haven't hung out much over the summer. It ended up to surpass my expectations, and I had a great time. For some reason it was a little easier to break the ice tonight with people I don't know very well than it usually is. I'm not sure if this will be a trend, or something just happened. Any ways, we had a great time and I cant wait to do it again. It seems sometimes that I have mediocre expectations for things that end up being great. However I love to go to the games and hang out with my friends, and sometimes make new ones. I wish I can do stuff like this more often. I also went mini golfing With Jess and Monica the other day, I had high expectations, but I had a feeling that I would screw something up or break the mood in some way. There were some awkward moments, but I think it was good practice for the future, and I personally had a great time. The trend of this story is obvious, but its also important to me. I love having fun with friends, no matter what the setting, or who they are. These past two days have been great. I hope that it can continue. "These are the best days of our lives, these are the days worth living, don't let these days slip away" -some song I heard today, not sure on the words, but it gets the point across.
