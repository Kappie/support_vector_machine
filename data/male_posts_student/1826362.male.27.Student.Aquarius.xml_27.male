And yes, I'm aware that there are probably more entertaining and more productive ways to be spending my tuesday afternoon (writing haiku perhaps?). But the show on right now is called animation creation.  It seems to be a bunch of shorts of stop action animation done with a video recorder and action figures.  Some of them are actually quite good.   This reminds me of my childhood best friend Dave Peterson.  We spent most of our time together from kindergarten through junior high, but sort of lost touch after beginning to attend Woburn senior High School.  Dave Peterson's dad (aka dave peterson) had a video camera, and we would use it to make short films and do stop action animation.  We took his mom's kitchen magnets and did some neat animation stuff on the kitchen table.   Anyway this animation show got me thinking about dave, and I thought that maybe if i put up a post about dave, he will google himself at some point and find my page, email me and we can be reunited, or at least get on each other's mailing list for christmas cards, not that isend out christmas cards or anything, but you get the point.   Now i realize that there are probably better ways of going about finding dave peterson.  I'm sure that when you do a google search on dave peterson, you get a billion hits.
