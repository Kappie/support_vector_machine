She walked by walked with her back turned and I kept staring willing myself to follow yet forcing myself to stay  I kicked myself on the inside for the mistake id just made it just didn't seem real to me that I had missed out on this opportunity  I watched the girl of my dreams pass by today she looked - then turned away
