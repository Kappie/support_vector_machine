This sucks, for more reasons then one. He's a very cool brother, and he taught me a lot of lessons... some by accident. But he has helped me stay on the "right path" and we spend a lot of time just hanging out, chilling and talking about whatever comes to mind.  Problem: He's taking his PC with him. The good one with the Nvidia Geforce 4 MX and matching chipset... the modded-out gaming/filesharing computer...  How will I get my fix without it?  :sob:
