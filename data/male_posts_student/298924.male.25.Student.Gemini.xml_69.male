I want to talk about Halle Berry....I knew for awhile that she had some problems....I mean no man in his right mind would ever divorce her unless either a)he was really gay and married her for the front or b)she was crazy....while the jury is still out on Dave Justice, I know for certain now that Halle is crazy....  Witness her professing to anyone who would listen about how happy she was to marry Eric Benet and how he was the perfect man for her etc.....fast forward to now, she has exposed her ta-tas for some crazy amount of money and has now chosen to be filmed taking it from the back buck-nekkid by Billy Bob Thornton....now all of this woulda been cool with me and what not but I turned on the View the other day (I hear you laughing OJ....I was bored and didn't feel like going into the living room to watch a DVD) and she is promoting the film and saying how if her husband was doing the same thing she would DIVORCE HIM!....I was like "What the eff?"....anyway I say all that to say that Halle is officially crazy....and that my friends is why I don't trust any attractive, single woman over 30....  Anyway that's all....it's my opinion and I'm sticking to it....
