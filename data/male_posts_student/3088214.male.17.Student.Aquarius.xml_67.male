The main issues lie in a person's beliefs, and debating the issue will not change how someone feels. The only debate is whether our great nation will allow everyone the same equal rights. I think it's amazing that our nation still hasn't resolved this issue, because to me it doesn't seem very complicated. Either we allow everyone to marry, and marry whomever they choose, or we deny part of our nation these equal rights. Marriage is between two people, who gave the rest of the country the right to tell them they cannot get married?  Steph B.
