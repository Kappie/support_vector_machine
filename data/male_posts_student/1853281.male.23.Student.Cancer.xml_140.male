This surprised me, many of my friends had warned me off the film saying that it was too violent and that i would be uncomfortable watching it. While i must admit that there was a certain amount of flinching, and even one a gag, the violence did not particularly bother me. I thought the premise of the film, with it's fucked up little twists was awesome and really liked it. What became of the delicate flower who could not bear to see a punch thrown in a film, let alone blood spattering and bones crunching? Also played some videogames, which i also have to admit i have a secret fondness. so today i feel totally and completely boy, although that probably was marred a little bit when i worked on the baby-booties i am knitting, this morning.
