I'll wonder aimlessly until someone helps or I find the coal site. Then I'll be okay, and by the way, the one time I spammed was I state a one time event. I don't plan on ever doing it again unless someone makes me angry. Which we all know is not very hard to do because I have a short fuse so don't mess with me. That is all. Freya out. :)
