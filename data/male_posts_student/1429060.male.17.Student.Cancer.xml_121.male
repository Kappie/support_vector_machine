This morning I arose bright and early to get to my new pseudo-occupation at the Baptist Cancer Institute. It was actually quite fun: the morning opened up with a breast cancer session, followed by several hours of reading up on breast and colorectal cancer, followed at noon by a general tumor council, specifically targeting the growth of blood vessels to colon tumors. They provided lunch with the noon session. All in all, rather enjoyable. Dr. Neese and Dr. Fowler are wonderful people to work with.  I have spoken to the owner of the Butcher Shop, who, incidentally, is a very good friend from our old neighborhood. He assured me that he could find some openings in several restaurants, maybe even in the Butcher SHop. A wonderful chap, Mr. Hughes.  SAT II's saturday. Gag me with a butcher knife.  I am overjoyed to realize I have been dreaming of late. At least, I can remember my dreams to an extent. In any case, that makes me happy. I remember that one last night included Elise, and she was driving her car. It was a happy dream, I remember that. Also, I had one today whilst I was sleeping after finishing the noon conference at Baptist. I remember I was with some female that I cannot remember at some rock concert thing, and it was exhilerating and strangely romantic and I enjoyed it immensely.  I have recently broken down and purchased  Echo  by Miss Divine Lia Block. Have a lovely evening.
