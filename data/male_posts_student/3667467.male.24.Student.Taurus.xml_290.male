"A female news reporter interviewed a recruiting general at his army base during her radio show. 'Just what do you teach these young boys when they come to you?' she asked.  'The basics,' he replied, 'survival, camping, and of course how to safely operate and fire a gun . . . '  'Do you really think that's a good idea, to have such young people to use firearms?'  'Like I said, we teach them safe and responsible usage of their guns.'  'Aren't you ashamed that you're equipping these men to become killers?' she pressed.  'Well,' said the general, 'you're fully equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not doing that either . . . '  The interview quickly ended."
