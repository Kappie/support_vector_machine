Today was our last day at school for a month, with exam leave starting on Monday. I've got a scary amount of exams, and for some reason, they've put them all in a few days of one another. I'm going to have to get down to revising very soon because these are the most important exams yet and they're the hardest. Eeek!  In other news, I made a bus driver accept a £10 note for a £0.70 bus fare, even though he protested. I cleaned him out of all his pound coins and left him with a useless piece of paper. How I laughted (well, sniggered quietyly).  Oh, the download is complete. Back to gaming, have a good weekend yourself...
