Like this year, I hope to join Anime, badminton, math contests and CSUNA. I also hope to join martial arts, dragonboat, chess team (if they have one), and if Keane really insists... yearbook committee...   Like almost all the students at Ward, I hope to do better next year, start working quicker, do more work faster, and don't slack off ^^;; I also look forward to the arrival of hoshi-chan... and maybe DYT...    Hafta remember to take Career Studies next year, as I didn't take it this year.   I look forward to the next year, and hope that it would be more successful than this year.    Whew! That was a long post x 5, ne?   ~Chronos
