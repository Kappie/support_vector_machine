She looked like she'd lost weight too. She wore a plain off white top with jeans, that's her style, I'll never forget it. Seeing that brought back Sundays we had. I used to be happy, then, a while ago. To I, an age.  She can't come for badminton this Saturday with F.I.S.H. I wish she would. I wonder if she thinks of me as much as I think of her. I hope so. It gets lonely.  I'm not the bad guy.  I had a great chat with Miss Lim and Mr Low in the office today. They were great. I miss them dearly. I went to Mrs Koh's after that, bearing gifts from far away lands. A pomelo from Ipoh and Persimmons from Israel.  The brand? - "Sharon's" No kidding! I'm stopping here. Sam's going to read this. Hi Sam!
