If they only knew how to play vball...then i would b happy, for the moment. Hhhanywayz, school sucked as always, ditched 1st period cuz i didnt do the work so yeah...whateva. Well i gave my valentines day cd to her yesterday, today she told me she loved it. That made me feel good of course cuz all of those songs were basically me singin or rappin those lyrics too her, And thats how much affection and love i have for her, so yeah, kinda corny, yet romantic...i think...lata
