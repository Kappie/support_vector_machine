I look pretty good now, other than the hair. I should probably get it trimmed. Alas, I have given up my VA trip. Indeed, the lotto and poker would of been a fine trip, aside from it being jellyfish season (I'm sure I would of got stung for money atleast once.) I shall end this post now. My parting wisdom for today kiddies is "Stop touching yourself there, it makes Jesus cry."
