On top of that I think I have a good chance at scoring some good tickets for some upcoming concerts. When I'm not traveling or going to a concert I hope to hang out with old friends, that I haven't seen in quite some time. Also I am now able to get a job with a work permit so I will have some extra cash. I think this will be a summer to remember.
