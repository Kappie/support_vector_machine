I told him that I am not into that kinda thing so I will just wait for "something to come my way" I guess. It was good to hear from him after not seeing him for a couple years now.     I got a letter from the Navy Reserve telling me I had to update my contact information in case they want to recall me to active duty. I would sooner put a gun to my head than go back into the service. The first 2 years were great...the last 3 years were a living hell with no sense of reality or common sense. I think I would either tell them to piss off or go live in Canada. Actually, I should just tell them I have a heavy drug problem or something. I should anyways right?????    I was thinking about that whole dog bite my nose off thing. I was pissed that crap keeps happening to me but then I was thinking, at least that stupid dog didn't take my eye! It was so close to my eye; I don't think I could live happily with one eye. The eye patch would be kinda cool though.
