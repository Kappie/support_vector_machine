Sat night I came home, my parents were going to a Christmas party  so I took my sister out to eat.  It was me and Mags, my sister, and Toms and his GF, Whitney.  WE went and ate at Bo lings.  I tried Plum Wine and it was good.  Traded toms my plum wine for his sake cuz he didn't like it and jst enjoyed dinner.  Toms and Whitney then went home and me and Mags went and rented, "The Cradle Wil Rock."  Great flick but a little slow.  Mags went to sleep almost immediately but I couldn't get to sleep forever.  Watched a beautiful mind and a special on The "Real" Junction Boys which was pretty interesting.  Ended up asleep at like 5:30.  That was my exciting night. Yet again you might recognize that no studying took place at all.  Sad...
