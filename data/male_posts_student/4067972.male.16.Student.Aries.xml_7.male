Herobuilders says it has come full circle and created "the only real hero:  Talking Our Lord Jesus Christ Action Figure".  It's Jesus action figure stands 12'' high, wears biblical robes and costs about $10.   Ok, so i'm not exactly sure what to say about this one.  Kinda speechless.  Where the heck would you get the idea to make a Talking Jesus Action Figure that recites the 10 Commandments?  Sometimes i just don't understand people.
