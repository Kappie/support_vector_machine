Speaking of vball, i think i've made up my mind about where to take this in the future...but that matter will not b discussed until after the summer season. Only a selected few know what i'm talkin about so i'll leave it in their handz not to talk about it at the moment cuz it would b awkward if many found out about it...Well next week is the last week of school and that is jus the greatest thing ever! hehe. I want this year to end in a good way, and have the most enjoyable summer ever!...hehe, well my main man cody bowen jus called me up a few momentz ago and imma chill at his house for a bit and steph is gonna b there, so its gonna b sweeeeet...hehe...payce outside folkz.
