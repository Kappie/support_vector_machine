There's no way I can hand two history 190s inaddition to 2 sociology classes and working 20+ hours a week. I was coming home too tired and not being able to do any readings on Thursday nights. The readings I need to do for my classes are simply an everyday thing. I'm playing too much catch up!  The loss of may from working less is going to suck, but I need to do some shopping for stuff tomorrow. I'm basically going to take it easy and then have some fun in San Diego this weekend at Andy's. I need an escape after this tough week!  **
