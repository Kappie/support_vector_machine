I also appreciate how you relate it to the constitution and personal rights.  So many major issues in American history are related to personal rights and civil liberties.   Do you think this issue has enough relevance to sway how you would vote for president?  Should it?  College portfolios...I think the college admissions process would be an interesting topic to debate...especially after out discussion in 2nd period today.  I think the movie Fog of War will lead to some interesting discussion.  For some of you it may help if you look into the life of Robert McNamara before watching the movie.    I love the post AP period...it actually gives us time to get to know each other.  Have a good evening and see you tomorrow.
