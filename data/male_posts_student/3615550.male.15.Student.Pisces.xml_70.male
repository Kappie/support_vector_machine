I am presently on the third draft of a rather lengthy thesis and am hoping to post it today or tomorrow.  I can't make any promises, but it will be here soon.  Until then...  John Kerry is now on the campaign trail with his V.P. pick,  urlLink John Edwards .   urlLink Liberal Mommy  seems quite happy about this, even though she didn't get what she  urlLink wanted .   Personally, I think the choice was all right, but I had hoped Kerry would make  urlLink this  choice for his runningmate.    I still think that Bush is going to win.  Edwards seems more in touch with reality than Kerry, but Kerry is so "out there" that I think he's unelectable.  Remember what I said about his dreamworld where America is a third world country in need of inspiration from such enlightened countries as France?    I guess Kerry chose Edwards because people say he is good looking.  The Americans are such a dumb people that many of us will vote for a person just because he is good looking (or in this case, because he has a good looking runningmate).  Well, it doesn't matter.  The White House is not gained by way of a fashion show; it is gained through an election which takes place in this place called reality, and Kerry is so absent from reality that he can't possible be elected.  He does have a few followers of the "anyone-but-Bush" kind who will stick with him, but that's just because they have left the real world in favor of the one Kerry inhabits.  Maybe I'm wrong.  What do you think?  Can Kerry, with his  new runningmate, beat Bush in November (a frightening prospect)?  I shudder to even think about that.  So tell me, what chance does Kerry have?
