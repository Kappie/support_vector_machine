I really like her, but if she'd rather be with someone else I guess it's ok.  The reason I'm saying this is because I saw a girl that I really liked last year, and it made me remember all the good times I had with her, so that lifted my spirits.  But if it came down to a choice between these 2 girls, I'd have to go with Erica...  Also, today was my last day of school (w00t!!!!!).  I really  should start practicing for cross country today, but xbox is callin...oh well, I'll post more about my day later :)
