One of the things I enjoy the most while on these kinds of trips is the intercontinental breakfasts. I guess I have a soft spot for having orange juice with bacon and eggs in the mornings, something I don't do while at home. After this, we will be taking the "skytrain" to some other popular shopping complexes since we have already spend quite some time with the one next to our hotel.    >   Now I am just taking a short breather from exploring this huge department store. Feeling kinda sheepish, there is a larger verity of some items here that I was looking out for rather than at the place where I had already bought. Guess I need more experience in the art of shopping. I'll do better next time. Should learn from my mom, this trip after all is a business-shopping trip for her to stock up on her side venture.    >   The weather here in Bangkok can be summed up in a word: Hot. Throw in the dust, crowds and the constant heavy traffic and it becomes dreadful. Good thing that this trip is mainly a shopping expedition which allows us to be indoors some times. On the other hand, since it is a shopping trip, I have not gotten much photo ops. Will try to get more.    >   Back in my room at the end of the shopping day. Getting ready for bed soon. It has been great walking around, digging for bargains and exploring the night markets and so forth, but a part of me is looking forward to returning home, even if it is just to enjoy the spoils of the trip. Also the reminder that I have a project and two new school modules awaiting me, drives me to get them over, done and out of the way as fast as possible. Exam results, and so forth all have to be faced. Guess I got to make the most of the time I have here then, and look forward to enjoying the stuff I bought. Going for Jap-Korean buffet tonight, should rock…
