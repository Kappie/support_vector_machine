Then maths lesson, kena scolding from mr lim, cause most of us never put in hard work. Haiz... i can feel the stress, everyday...its increasing, a little at a time. Maybe Mr lim is right, this is just not good enough. I can see other ppl already starting. The sense of urgency was there, like wat ms foo said, but 4 Benedict...most of us are still taking things one thing at a time, slacking, forgetting that prelims and Os are near. Well, cant bother much about them. Everyone is on their own now. Either we make it, or we break it... The a.maths test was quite ok, but was stress at the beginning after receiving the lecture, but i managed to finish the paper. After that went straight home, and found mother playing mahjong again. Ya, so i kicked up a fuss, which she ignored anyway and did abit of maths before taking a nap, then went market for dinner. i think i hav to cut down on sleeping, anot i wont get anywhere. Progress of my studies are slow, but at least...its getting on its way. I really think its time to get serious...for once, before i really screwed my whole life up. Think i'm going to do a little bit more of maths and get to slp, tomolo is gonna be a busy day.
