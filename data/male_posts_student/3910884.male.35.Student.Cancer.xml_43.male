Looks like NATCO is a large COOP organizer in the Philippines.    Haikus will be dubbed the  Coconut Chronicles - Isang Bansa, Isang Diwa . Who knows, maybe I'll save them all and reprint them!     The Unknown Farmer   Brown skin in deep mud,  Unacknowledged and ignored,  Feeding a nation.     Kalabaw Grazing   Kalabaw grazing,  The day's toil forgotten,  Peace as the sun sets.     It's What's Inside that Counts   I am a FilAm,  I don't look Filipino,  My blood is pinoy.     Where are the Aetas?   The mountain people,  Aetas indigenous lost,  Forgotten by us.     Walking the Strip   Red lights red dresses,  Flesh for rent young and nubile,  The only way out?     Aren't We All?   We love our country,  Why can't we love our people,  Aren't we all pinoy?     Survivors   My fractured culture,  Halo-halo ang lahat,  Survivors di ba?     Hydra Poltics   Corrupt politics,  Mythological hydra,  Corrupt at the core.     Status Quo   Status quo hell no,  Equal rights for you and me,  Oppresion no more!     Who Are We?   Our identity,  Forced onto us by others,  Who are we really?     Halikan   Dark hair and dark eyes,  C'mon halikan kita,  I'm not bolero!     I'm No Rizal   Rizal where are you,  My quiet inspiration,  To be more like you.     New Millenium Messiah   Modern religion,  Progressive Catholicism,  Jesus upgraded.     Dessecrated   Developing world,  The price to pay to catch up,  Dessecrated earth.     Love   Life's sweetest reward,  Love so exciting and new,  Chance a new romance.     I Will Always Fight for Freedom   Katipunero,  Brown skin shining in the sun,  Fighting for freedom.     The Same   Hey Filipinos,  From the same mother,  The same song is sung.     Creation   Sacred feminine,  Pinays your powers revered,  Creation is yours.     Exhaust-ive   Tricycle sunrises,  Jeepneys roar past in a blur,  Toxins fill my lungs.     Long Life   Singing and dancing,  Resilient against hardships,  Mabuhay to us!     Cultural attitudes:      Filipinos tend to be very group oriented compared to Americans who tend to be individualistic and who are often rewarded for their individualism.    Advantages of being mestizo raised in the U.S. = I feel hella tall when in the mall.    Stop signs do not exist in the Philippines. They are a figment of your imagination.    Went to the Center for Kampampangan Studies at Holy Angel University in Angeles City. The Kampampangans have a rich background that dating back a few thousand years. I have the book, you can read it if you want. ;)
