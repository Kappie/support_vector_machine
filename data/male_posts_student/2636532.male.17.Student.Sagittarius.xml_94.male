Janitor? no it's easy work. mayhaps a person working in a sewage treatment plant, nah they get to play with all sorts of fun doodads, plus you can find some pretty sweet stuff that you can pawn off as long as you don't say where it came from. no i've decided that the worst possible job you can have is being a packer in a fudge factory. imagine how your children would deal with this, imaginewhat would happen the day the teacher asks the child what his or her parents do, i think it would go something like this...   Teacher:  What does your daddy do Timmy?  Timmy:  He's a fudge packer!  Teacher : now Timmy that's not very nice. now really what does he do?  Timmy : I told you! he packs fudge all day long!  Teacher : Now Timmy you are just being rude.  Timmy : I'm telling the truth! honest! Everyday he and lots of other men go into a big room and they all pack fudge.  Teacher : Timmy!!!  Timmy : and sometimes when we need more money he packs fudge til really late at night! Teacher: That's it Timmy! go to the principles office!  Timmy : but but but i was tellng the truth!  And that's how i think it would go. Thus traumitizing the poor child and making him affraid of talking about his father and costing him thousands in doctor fees for the therapy he needs after his nervous break down when he's asked if he wants a fudge sundae. -Matt
