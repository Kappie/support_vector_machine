What am i doing? what made me want to do this? I mean really! what kind of a loser makes a blog? obviously a pretty bored one. lol. My house sucks i have nothing to do except work on my freaking driveway which is annoying as hell! I wish something exciting would happen in puslinch like a big fire or a ninja knife fight in my backyard, now that would be entertaining lol. I wish i was anywhere but here im sooo bored or at least i wish somebody was here with me. Like my beatiful girlfriend andrea, Then i'd be having fun!
