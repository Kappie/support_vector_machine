And of course, I played on the computer, did a bit o' reading, and played a game of level 2 chess yesterday. What a fun summer I am having.  Well, I'm going to Dorset this evening, which should be fun fun fun. I'll probably be back later in the week, by the weekend most likely.  And that's about all there is to say. Of course I could moan about CocaCola, McDonalds, youth today, modern music, and the state of the health, transport and education systems, but I'll save it for another time.  Bye for now.
