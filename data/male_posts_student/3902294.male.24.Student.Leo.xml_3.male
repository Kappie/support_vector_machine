The Realm of Entelle    Well where to start is the stories that helped me develop what I have thought of so far. As I said in a previous post, I am a huge fan of Tolkien and after rereading several of his works, I have been given many ideas but I am being careful in trying to make my works unique. The actual ideal of the world actually started many years ago about 1998 or 1999 in which I gave the realm the name called Entelle. In order to make it different from Tolkien and many other writers, I decided to make the realm a complete island world with many islands surrounding it and therefore the name in an ancient language is called the Island Realm. I will attempt to write and later add onto the description/names as I am still devising a language system:    The Second Age (Rough Draft)  The Realm of Entelle has been through many changes. The name given, by the those known in legends as the Life Bringers, was the Island Realm as it has many chains of islands. Before becoming under the Destructive Wrath, the Great Land covered almost the entire realm. Four mountains surrounded all sides of the land leaving a large plains/valleys with many beautiful forests though most of it was chopped down by the men who came to live there. It is said because of this, many scars where left behind including desolated lands where no life exists and many marshes due to flooding, the punishment for such destruction.  The Moutains of the North have been named the Cursed as a large evil was known to live there and it is said that in beyond them is the Ice Field as well as the Mist, said to be the source of all evil. A large sacred river seperated the mountains and the Plains. It is said to flow southeastern, disappearing into the mysterious eastern moutains though there are many tribunies that flow from it southward form many lakes and rivers.  The eastern moutains is said where the wise Dragons live along with the people known as the Riders. It is said within the mountains amount of caves, dens where the dragons once dwelled. There are also many halls, home of the Riders of the East, containing the largest amount of information recorded in the entire realm. Said to have remained undamaged even after the invasion of the hall, it was never found until near after the Final Defeat.  Beyond the mountains of the south is a coast where many mariners live. It is said that this is where many of the exiles fled first. After the construction of the first fleet, many sailed away to the other island but few remained behind and built many sea towns that is strung along the coast.  At the time, only one island chain was well known as it became the leading island after the Destructive Wrath to follow. But at the time, it was still in it's younger days.
