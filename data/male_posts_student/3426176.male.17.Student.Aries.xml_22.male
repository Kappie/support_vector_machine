By the time that was done, it was time for lunch.  So I went to Subway and got a... I forgot and went to eat it in the car while I listened to the album rated 100/100 by me,  Damnation and a Day . (read yesterday's review if you haven't already)  After I ate, I still had another hour to burn.  So I called up my buddy Steve (go visit his blog) and I went to his house.  We looked at funny stuff online and chatted about stuff.  I saw this hilarious video of this guy who seems to think he is a Swedish version of that "Rico Suave" guy.  The line this guy uses is something like, "Ooooh, you touch my tralala, my ding ding dong".  It is so cheesy and hilarious.  Here's the link to it right here:   urlLink Tralala, Ding Ding Dong    After my wonderful visit at Stephen's house, it was off to soccer practice.  At first we didn't do much.  We just took shots on goal.  My left footed shot has worsened dramatically.  I was almost happy with it, but after today's performance I realised it still needs lots of work.  My right footed shots weren't too great either, but I am doing better with my power shots.  We then went on a long run.  I am somewhat pleased with my performance.  My legs held up very well, thanks to my 45 minute exercise chair workouts, I wasn't out of breath, which is another improvement, but my heart could not take the running at all.  That was my weak point.  If you know of any cardiovascular exercises that will improve stamina, I would like to know what they are.  (I know what is the first thing you all are going to say, but that won't work b/c I don't have a girlfriend)  After the run, it was time for a 6 v. 5 match.  I was on the team with five players and I think my performance suffered on account of that.  I could not find anyone to pass to, so I was making ill-advised passes.  The rest of the match, I was an absolute non-factor.  After we lost it was time for a desperately needed break.    We played juniors v. seniors and us seniors enjoyed most of the possession.  This game was tremendously better for me.  Towards the beginning I decided to do away with the ponytail.  It may have helped.  I began to make good passes and good decisions.  Maybe it was the teammates that were making me better, but I also felt a lot more energised, a lot more confident, and a lot more in pain.  My hip flexor is a problem that is not going away.  I made a plethora of good passes, almost good passes, a few good shots, one goal, and one great run up the middle beating the entire junior team and getting my shot blocked.  After that, the confidence shot straight up.  My defending became better, my aggression became more intense, I could read the game better, I made great supporting runs, my first touch was coming with ease, and I seemed to have endless amounts of energy.  I felt like that was one of my best performances in a very long time.    Sometimes I play like absolute excrement (the first game) and sometimes I can surprise everyone and play extremely well. (the second game)  I just hope that when tryouts come in August I can play extremely well.  If I do, I just might have a slight chance of making the team.    During the long run and the first game, I realised I will most likely not make the team at all.  I barely did last year and there is so much good talent coming up from last year's sophomore and freshman team and even the eighth graders are going to advance up to varsity.  Only five seniors graduated so with so much talent coming in and so little going out, I fear that cuts will be made.  It will be a major disappointment if I fail to make the team since it is my last year and I have not lived up to my expectations for the last six years.  But it's also not fair if a freshman is better than me and he gets sent down just so I can stay on the team.  I'll leave that decision to my coach Alan.  But the second game gave me hope that I can overcome all odds.  If I attend the soccer camp and play a lot over the summer, maybe that will show Alan that I have the dedication to make the varsity team.  I am already starting to get ready for next year.  I just need to remember this second game and how well I played.  That will allow me to desperately cling on the hope I have for next season.  That will give me the confidence I desperately need to play at my highest level.  I will not back down.  I will not give up yet.
