I'll probably write it tonight.. we are going to Valley Fair on friday, and it should be hella fun. Jake is coming down on Saturday night, we will party like none other(ha, just imagine me partying like none other). I set up this computer that I recieved for free from my church as a web server, but it is too slow, really, to actually host a web site. Oh well. It's a P133 with 96 megabytes of RAM and an ATI Rage 128 Graphics Card. It runs Half-Life, and it is actually playable, which is pretty funny.
