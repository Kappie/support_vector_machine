'twas a boring day anyways. went to see the g'rents. sat around and slept for about 5 hours. then came home. eh.   is it a bad thing if i already wish i were back at boys state just as an excuse to get away from nearly everything here in c-town? no? didnt think so. this place sucks. i have nothing else now, though i was called shallow again today for some reason. eh. that person can go f*ck off for all i care. sorry. dont mean to be bitchy here.   i have money. did you get that? i...have...money... must be the planets in allignment or something... i dunno. i did have a thought today though. i was talking to someone else, i think it was Langdon, and we brought up the subject of girls. i kept referring to them as "chicks" and it occured to me that girls might find that degrading. hmm... answer at your own risk please, i'm out for the day/night/afternoon/morning/dusk/dawn (depending on where you live).  by the by, my hair is supa long. i have been converted to the brandon boyd look. wings.
