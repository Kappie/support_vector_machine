(i didn't even get to taste or even look at the so call iron chefs' dishes...)  well, i saw her being quite antisocial, it looked like she doesn't have much friends in this class, i actually intended to talk to her but jessie was always with her, even if i was to talk, i will have jessie's replies instead of hers... so in the end, i just went on with my piano learning session... (with laylay and her gang disturbing me...) pam was the birthday girl so went to have a ride with her in our bicycles.... many people attended the party, invited and unwelcomed, and they all drank a little, it was rather boring because there was nothing to do much but it still was fun in a way, a way that i can't describe... =D  wee ping was bothered by her friend's problem, about quitting poly and join the workforce, she was afraid to supported her friend of the wrong choice but her friend kept insisted that it will be better off for him to quit now and join the workforce, since he didn't enjoy what he was doing now, so wee ping could only hope that his choice was the right one and support him...
