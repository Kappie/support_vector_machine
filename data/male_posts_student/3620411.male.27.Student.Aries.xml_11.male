Yesterday morning I watched a news program (cant remember the name of the show) and one interesting news apart from news of environmental activist, Charoen Wataksornthere (quote from  urlLink pisal's blog  ) is a grand  opening of the subway on July 3.    As you know and some of you may already have been visiting Thailand, the major problems is the traffic jam.. I don't know why even the oil prices has been raising and people still using their own car. and I mean 1 car only 1 driver and no passenger.   Still don't know that Thailand is still a poor country? coz I see many new cars on the street every day .. and some are the Europian cars like BMW, Mecedes Benz, etc.. People complaining about the high gasoline prices but they still drive their car.  Again maybe because of the public transport are not as good as developed countries as us Australia and Japan (Only 2 countries I been to =( ) They have a proper bus, train schedule. So people can estimate the time to get to the place they wanted to.   But in Thailand the good estimate is during rush hours can prepare yourself for about 2 hrs. to get to a short distance .. for example to get from my place to uni is takes about 15- 20 min by taxi without traffic (offcourse there are some short cuts where the bus couldn't go but not much) but if i go on a bus during rush hours i have to spend about 1.5 - 2 hrs to get to the place inculding time to wait for the bus..   I wish for better transportation ..    urlLink more news on subways
