Man that test was hard Questions made no sense to me Good thing I cheated  The teacher read this? I don't think he did because I ought not have passed  Did you get a B? Yes? I feel much better now No? I hope you die  Which semester's grades? They're running three behind now Not on their term bills  1Ls -- want my notes? You're more than welcome to them Won't tell you my grade!  Employers: they care But all they see is first year Then they don't matter  One dumb professor Turned in all his grades on time His colleagues shot him
