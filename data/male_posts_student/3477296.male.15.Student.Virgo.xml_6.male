Jonathan" n them im like damnnnnn. "yeah errr... welllll ummmm.... most prolly". Dang those piercing eyes cut me deep, sweat poured down my back, i felt my face slowly changin hue I just couldn't say no.... ahhh the pressure. so i guess now im stuck wif 3 U, if i'd said no... english marks = DOWN. O wellz i can drop it in yr 12 n pik up 4 U maths (no im not a nerd, im simply azn). and js rndmly "friends...NOT boy/girl-friend" oooooo andy's got a bf..... keke *cough*  andy unsure of his sexual preference  *cough*.. ahhh we knew it all along. and yes andy i kno wat u mean but it still sounds funny. :P
