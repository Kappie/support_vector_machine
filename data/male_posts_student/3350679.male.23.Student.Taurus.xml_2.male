It is on the question of regeneration partnerships and democratic deficit  but that is not what is worrying me I have basically decided that my life has to have some direction in the next 3 weeks because by that time I will be going slightly crazy with cabin fever so I best get on with those applications.  Tomorrow I will begin too look for some part time work which will hopefully give me a bit of a direction.  Besides my aunt and uncle say its will be "good for me" and "allow me to meet people" I really hate this thing in my family that require people to micromanage my life. So looking for new place to stay at the moment   lets hope something comes up soon eh
