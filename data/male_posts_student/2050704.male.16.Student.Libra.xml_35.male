I mean I have been outside pretty much all day since summer started ... then on Tuesday afternoon Me  Rachel and Vince and Dave walked around for a little while then me and Vince played soccer against his garage. So I go home to eat dinner and have a shower and I look in the mirror and the back of my neck is sunburnt ... ok, a sunburn wouldn't be AS bad if my whole body got burnt .. then at least it turns into a tan somewhat .. but this is JUST on my neck. Like how in the hell does that fucking work?   The Big "L":  Nope, this is not a category from double jeopardy. Again on Wednesday night we went to Vinces house and everybody got the sudden urge to go swimming in Vince's 3 foot pool in their clothes. Then when I wouldn't go in the pool with my clothes, I got the big loser name slapped at me. Sorry, didn't know I had to go swimming in my clothes when I didn't want to, and when I was freezing cold anyways. Of course everyone was just joking around, and I laughed about it later, but at the time I was pissed.   "The Shadow":  I go to the movies to see Spiderman 2 at Silver City today. Of course the little window where the movie comes out of is where a couple seats are so when people get up there is a shadow. Now normally, if people think they are going to have a sudden urge of diarrhea they  DONT  sit in those seats, so that they dont disturb the movie. Well that was until today. This one lady must have gotten up out of her seat 7 TIMES! ... SEVEN ... WHO THE FUCK GETS UP OUT OF THEIR SEAT 7 TIMES!? And I mean its not just like a little thing in the corner of the screen .. it is a giant head, in the middle of the screen, blocking the movie. Like geeze, once is acceptable, even twice is alright .. but SEVEN times is just pushing it .. and asking for the bird. Murphy.   Irony:  Wednesday night dave was running at the pool, and then he slipped and landed on his back. Ok, i DO know how much it hurts when that happens, but it was still funny as hell. Anyways, as I was laughing, I turned around, went to take 3 steps to sit down on the deck .. and WHAM ... I did the same thing Dave did, except I landed on the concrete, and cut my knee. Damn irony.   Cuts on my knee:  Self explanitory.   .. thats pretty much it for now .. but it is only Wednesday night, so im sure more things will piss me off this week. Oh and heres one more thing that pisses me off ...   No comments:  I know this comment system isn't as good as the old one, but you could at least leave an anonymous comment .. something that tells us that at least somebody is reading the blog.
