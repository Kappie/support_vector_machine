       
      When you are greeting someone, in passing, and they ask you "How are you?" do you respond with "I'm fine," or "I'm fine, how are you?"   I usually respond with "I'm fine," or "Good," in a cheerful tone of voice. However, I have a growing suspicion that people are percieving me as distant or antisocial because I do not reciprocate with another "How are you."      info.link:  urlLink http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx   [Listening to: Tequila -  urlLink The Champs  (02:13)]
