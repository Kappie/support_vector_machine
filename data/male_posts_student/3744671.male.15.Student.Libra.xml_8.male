It was created by Matt Groening who created the Simpsons, but I will go on record and say I like Futurama better than The Simpsons (I love the Simpsons too though). The reason why I like it better is mainly because I am a huge Sci-Fi geek so to speak so I love the little references to Star Trek and other Science-Fiction stuff in here.   This beauty has 13 episodes, all of which also have directors commentary, which is (from what DVD sets I've bought so far) the BEST commentary, and most funny I've ever heard. I haven't got the Volume Two of Futurama yet though, so this is just going by the few DVD sets I've bought thus far. While we're talking about extras, it also has a few scripts, amonst other stuff you can find on here.   All the episodes look beautiful. The show actually uses a combination of 2D and 3D animation, so it looks really cool. All the voice acting is fabulous, I think I enjoy listening to these actors better than the ones who do the Simpsons even. All the writing is great too. I love it!   Overall, if you at all like the Simpsons and/or Sci-Fi like me, you will FLIP out over this, it's incredible! A must have DVD!!     Rating:  5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
