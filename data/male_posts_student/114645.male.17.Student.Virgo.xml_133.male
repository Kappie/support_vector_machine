Why are there mean people and why do they suck? I got some new hair gel, pomade actually, and it will be WAY easier on my hair. So I put it in and people think that I just got out of bed and didn't do my hair. WTF? It isn't hard like gel, but does the same thing as gel. It is like I can't change ANYTHING about my look or people freak out. This same thing happened when I bleached my hair. Hello people! I did this how many times last year! Please. But moving on to today's events:  Today was interesting. Slow, but interesting. So let's start in French. We played Bloody Fingers, as we normally do, and I was picked like 4 from the end. Why? I dunno. People suck. Are you beginning to see a pattern?   Then I went to Ground School. The one time I actually did the homework, by like reading the book; does Mr. Kelly ask us questions? NO! Ugh! Okay, then I went to American Literature where I forgot my book, AGAIN! Ugh. So we went over Rapaccini's Daughter by Nathaniel Hawthorne. What a BORING story. We ended up talking about how Ms. Nickels (my teacher) got her family stoned at Thanksgiving and action figures. How? I donâ€™t know.  Then Lunch. Lunch was alright I guess, except Kim kept stealing my chicken from my salad!  Then I went to History. We are doing projects. We have been since last Monday. I went last Tuesday. I was so nervous. Joe told me that I stuttered. Oh well, I got an A.  So I had to go to bank from Brummett for CloseUp (the program I'm in for going to Washington DC. More info soon!). So he told me to go to the bank. So I do. Is the banker there? No. Where is she? How the hell should I know? That racist bitch is NEVER there. So I did that then went back to history.  Then I go to Math, and this is when the day gets interesting. I moved up because the dumb beaner who thinks she is black keeps telling us to "BE QUIET!" and stuff like that. So I move up, and does that bitch shut up? Hell no. Grrr.  . But anywayz, we get to the end of class, so I go to the back of the room to shoot the shit with Joe and Asian Sean. So we are standing there talking, and I reach over and grabbed Sean's ass. So what does Sean do? I was thinking he would do it back, thus proving my point that he is gay, but NOOOOOOOOOOOO he reaches over and does the same thing to Joe. Joe is VERY straight. I have never seen Joe that pissed before. Not even when Justin called Meghan a whore. I was like HOLY SHIT! I hope Sean is gay, I would date him. And by date I mean corrupt, lol.   Yea, then I go to French Aide and Leland asks me for my Verb book but I don't have it. I think he likes me, but my opinion doesn't count because I think "everyone is gay." At least that is what Meghan says. Well. I'm gonna go.  Now you know why I say people suck.
