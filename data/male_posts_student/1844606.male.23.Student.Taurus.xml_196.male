As I type, I'm 90% through downloading the Wilco show I saw a few days ago.  Then I plan on downloading the Velvet Revolver show I didn't get tickets to-the two Wilco shows I saw in Sept., the Jeff Tweedy show I didn't see in Jan. and some bobby dylan live in Chicago.  Then who knows.  Good thing I've got a T1 line and no one else is around these parts.  The major complication will be figuring out how to convert and listen to all this music!
