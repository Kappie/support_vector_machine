My dad seemed very lonely that evening, so I decided to spend some time with him.  This entailed splitting a bottle of wine and learning about his early years in the old country.  Fascinating stuff... especially once the wine started flowing:)  So what is the plan for this week?  Sushi on Wednesday... anyone up for a $4 movie tomorrow?  Farenheit 911 is not playing at Westwood or Westgate, but we could go see the Terminal (even though Lana said it sucks.)    Lana, if you get off work early on Friday, when would you be back in town?  Maybe we could still do a ladies tea this weekend...  Sunita, what's your availability?
