The bit where i say that i don't want or need anyone else? thats the good bit. the bad bit, i am going on a journey, she can't come with me. no one can come with me. my little book has been filled. filled with memories, things i want to keep. but the only thing i really want to take away with me is her.   my nightmare; open spaces, with no one i know. bieng alone, alone in a crowd. i am so afraid, im scared because there i no one to hold my hand. shes not there to hold my hand.   i will of course make it work, as long as she's happy with that. i'm really not much to hold onto. but i'm not going to let her go. this all sounds a bit tragic. but i guess i dont care. i'm done with stuffing all my problems into a box. it all comes out eventually. or maybe i should. i don't know.
