After a little washing up and breakfast, I started on my work. Soon it was 8.49am, I dashed out the front door after I changed and a splash of water on my face to keep me away. I was there at Dover early and waited for the rest of the brothers to come, but Cher Hao and I left Shawn (still on his way to Dover) since it was running late. We ran to class, I can’t remember the last time I ran, but it was damn tiring. It really isn’t fair to have faculty located so far away from the Dover station. Yupz we made it in time to get out attendance marked. After the lecture, Shawn and I lets Mr Yen read out write out. I wonder did he really go through every word.   Well anyway, we were reluctant to head for our LC class (English lesson) after the earlier lecture. Shawn was asking me if I would like to join him later on to go NY to see someone, and the rest of Brothers wanted to head for home to get a rest. But Cher Hao just had to turn up for LC just because he needed to show his M.C. to the LC tutor, and we were to accompany him. Class ended early cause we were requested to go get our presentation topics from our own lecture. Sadly I was stuck in the com lab for the next 2hr30min with Cher Hao just because our lecturer was not in. Cher Hao was supposed to do his write up, but instead 45mins was spent playing  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/bowman.html  with me. HEHEHeheheee.... I won him 45mins into the game!!! It was 5pm when we finally got our presentation topics.   5pm: Shawn was back in school waiting for the rest of his rugby friends to make their way down to NYJC for training. We could have met and traveled together if it weren’t for that tortoise Cher Hao. So I didn’t go down NY, but who will still be there by the time I reached? Back at home, all was usual. I sat down in front of the com eating back and white M which looked something like those black and white seeds used in Chinese board game. On Msn, Tara was having a verbal constipation. Heheheee…. When she used that expression I was both amused  disgusted. Amused, because I never though those two words can come together. And disgusted, because if she remember what she was going to say, I would be her toilet bowl. Hahhaa… Just Kidding. So she remembered, and told me all about this wonderful gift her dad got her from his Cambodia trip. Everything about it was so very nice, she repeated, from the aroma oil down to its woodwork packaging. Lao Er popped beside me and saw our conversation, and then she started to compare her gifts. POOR OLD ME, I had to sample all the perfumes/ aroma oils Lao Er has. My nose was all irritated after that man. Getting bored, I checked my hotmail in box to find only one e-mail from Tara. Hahhaa.. It was about the things that had happened in our lives when we were young. This wasn’t the first time I had received such mails, but it never fails to make me smile and laugh about the things we used to love, hate and do.   Tara went to bed before 2am, good for her. 30mins later, I couldn’t hold out too… so  Z-+m  NitE
