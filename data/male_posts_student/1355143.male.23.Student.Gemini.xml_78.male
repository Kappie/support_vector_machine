Ulli, I know more interesting stuff than that happens in Reykjavik. I hear they even broadcast Bob Ross' painting show in Iceland (as well as the UK). He's an icon over here....discuss. Prince of Tides is about neither princes nor tides...discuss.   A, what's happened to the camera? Have a spill while bumping and grinding? Run into some camera-thumping toughs prowling the Raval? Conor's got himself a new camera...the Pentax one that fits in an Altoids tin. Pretty sweet lil' hunk o' tin. Currently I'm enjoying the lingering sunshine due to daylight savings time (just happened this Sat...I believe we're behind you Europeans). The baseball season kicked off today...Vice President Cheney threw out the first pitch for my Cubbies, but we managed to win despite the fact.   Gotta get some grub now...I'll throw more at ya later.  T-dog
