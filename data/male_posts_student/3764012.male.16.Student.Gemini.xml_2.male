I really want some  wang qing sui ....i have seriously thought about it ... is to really let her go .... i cannot carry on anymore .... no matter what i do will not touch her heart and she will never be happy , i hope she is happy and not angry or dislike me because of my behaviour.... sometimes something really need to let go ... if it is yours it will come back if not it will go away forever ,i think there is someone out there interested in her , if that guy ever treat her badly or bully her , prepare for a knock out , now i must concentrate more on my study rather than her becasue N levels is just less than a month , now is the best time to study becasue of national day holidays , i MUSt WORK to be the 1st in Na standard , yesterday i watch a show if i am not wrong its name is True Courage .... it is about a guy who is very successful , he got a rank , career , a wonderful girlfriend and a happy family .... just one night after he had supper with his girlfriend , he rode his bike on the express way , he thought there was no other cars around becasue it was quite late , with high speed he never noticed a road block and he crash into a railing or car or some sort , and flew many many Meters away with his bike broken into half , even his helmet is spinning on the ground , his face was really disfigured and he had a very bad head injury , he gone through several surgery until one day he woke up from his COMA and forgotten everyone that he knew and he was just like a 3 year old kid .... this is not the part that i really want to mention , it is after he was discharge , at home he look really like a 3 year old kid , becasue of his medical fees his father cannot go through a heart surgey and died ... i was really sad when i saw that .... but he inspired me to work harder and believe nothing is impossible because he decided to end his life by comitting suicide but he just cannot do it becasue his neighbour who was also paralyse during a car accident made him realise that he could do something rather than sitting around doing nothing but complaining and want to die ....so he changed , he threw away all his clothes , broken up with his wonderful girlfriend and began to study , waht did he study ? , he went to university to study about human brain , to find answer on how to regain his memory , what inspired me most is that he had a very bad memory eversince but he can study very hard to get the degree he wanted and so now he live a normal life but now he also help people who suffer from his same fate to regain confidence and to treat their problems ...      after i saw this program , i really believe that with determination , nothing is impossible ,he can turn from a hero to zero in just one accident but he took many many years just to stand up and excel again , i really wanted to salute him and shake his hand to celebrate his success with him ... i believe if i can also have this determination in me i believe that nothing is impossible , at least i can learn from him , i never met any accident and i have a very healthy body , i really want to thank him , he gave me confidence to stand up and face my failures again , my life for this year is not a very good one , do anything there wil be failures such as geting very low for tests , having realtionship problems , from GOHC to GOH , as long i do anything fail anything but i believe this is going to end now ! ? why ? because from today onwards , i will never be the same again , I want to be a high ranking officer , i want to be a national fighter , i want to go university , i want to find a good wife ,all this is not a dream but my goals that can turn into reality....no matter how hard this road is going to be even it is hell i will go though it and be a better man !i want to put down all my burdens and walk towards this new direction that i set for myself ....
