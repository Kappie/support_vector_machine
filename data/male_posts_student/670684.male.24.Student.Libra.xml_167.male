Also, some people prefer to play the "sleazy 50" or the "pansy 45" rather than the whole 60.        - There is a  urlLink double helix  that defies science and genetics.      - Golf, golf.  Golf golf golf.  Golf golf golf golf golf golf rug.        - In Austin, there are nightlly guitar circles at a plethora of venues, strumming out Ani DiFranco and The Indigo Girls, among others.  And unless there is a new Pro-America Ani album out, I don't think the guitar circles in Rogers, Arkansas play the same things.        - Cover bars suck in most college cities.  But people still go to them.        -  urlLink Showtime  is one of the best television networks out today, and while Penn and Teller's show  urlLink Bull Shit  didn't have the zest of any Michael Moore-led comedy documentary,  urlLink Family Business  could be the greatest show ever.  Well, except for  urlLink The Tortellis .      - I am the only person in the world who would TiVo  urlLink 227 .      - The green on hole #9 at The Links in Lowell is shaped like the State of Arkansas.  Favorite pin position - Forrest City.  Most balls land closer to Vicksburg, Mississippi though.
