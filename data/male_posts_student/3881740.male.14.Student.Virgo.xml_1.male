When there's trouble you know who to call  Teen Titans  From their tower they can see it all  Teen Titans  When there's evil on the attack  You can rest knowing they've got your back  Cause when the world needs heroes on patrol  Teen Titans..go  With their super powers they unite  Teen Titans  Never met a villain that they liked  Teen Titans  They've got the bad guys on the run  They never stop till the job is done  Cause when the world is losing all control  Teen Titans...go  1,2,3,4,Go!  Teen Titans
