I went to Fridays last night and have decided that there is officially no restuarant in Davidson County, Tennessee that really wants Black customers....last night I was with a group of the most civil people in my class (mind you I usually hang with some wild folks and so I was giving the managers the benefit of the doubt) and our service was yet again horrible....  It's the same story everywhere we go....P.F. Chang, Outback, The Cooker, Chili's....I mean if I go one on one or maybe with 3 it's fine....but let us get a group of 6 or more and there are problems....the thing is I've been in many of these restuarants on other occassions and seen how large groups from Vanderbilt or white business people are treated and it doesn't compare....often they are even wilder than our groups could ever imagine, yet they get the benefit of the doubt....  So Killa Cal is through with Nashville eating establishments in large groups....it's pot luck or bust....
