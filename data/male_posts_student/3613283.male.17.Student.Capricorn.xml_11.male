Bush defended the administration's claim that Iraq and al-Qaeda were conducting meetings ...etc even after the 9/11 commission said that there are no proof to back up the claim.  This morning, as I was driving towards the U.S. Embassy, I was listening to France's largest radio and guess how the 7am newscast began? " The reason for the war in Iraq was a BIG LIE!"  the host said with a very  enthusiastic  voice. I can tell you it was really astounding how unfair, biased, unbalanced, deceitful the newscast was.  Anyway, there is no question that Saddam and Usama established contacts, it's documented. Were they planning things?  Don't know.  Did the U.S. administration ever said Saddam had orchestrated 9/11?  Rummy says no . Have they lied?  NO!    urlLink The Hill.com: House GOP disputes the 9-11 finding
