Some language, some scenes that you could go without, but the violence as one would expect in a movie like this wasn't tobad. This contradicts with my cousin's opinion, but then again, that's why it is called an oppinion. It rarley actually showed the expendable crewman getting stabbed or anything like that. Blood was occasional, and this one part where Arthur has to pop somebody's fingers back into socket looks painful. Kind of like the feeling you get when someone scratches their fingernails on a blackboard....yeah, like that. Theatres don't come in the best ways possible in my city...we have two fairly good ones. The Cinemark, and the AMC. The AMC tends to be expensive though, and it's not on my side of town. The starworld, which is the one we used, is ok but i wouldn't give it an award for....something like...seat cushioning...or backlighting wonders....or stuff like that. Time keeps going while I type, and I need to get up early this morning. Out for now...
