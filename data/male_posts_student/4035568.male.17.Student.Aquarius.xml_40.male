Freedom. - Well I've never really had curfews or any of that crap, but I do feel as though I don't have some of the strings I once had tugging back at me. A good example of this is me staying out at night for the past few days. Mom calls around 11ish and I tell her I'm still out in town, hse goes to bed, I arrive at home whenever the crowd at the local BP(or the picnic shelter on those rainy days) decide it's time to pack it in for the night. (See seperate paragraph on "cruising the local hot spots). Anyway, so now that I have freedom, I now am up to bat for making my Mom upset. I unlocked the door tonight with her asleep on the couch waiting for me. Woohoo, not a word was said, she just woke up, turned off the tv, and went to bed without saying a word. I can tell she really enjoys this.  So Old so soon? - Yes, I know, it's so HARD to imagine that my parents little baby has grown up already. I'm not the first child to start applying to college, but it's scaring them to death knowing that in only a few short months, they will have sent all 3 of their children to college. I suppose back in the day(and I do mean back in) that sending all 3 of us to school after high school was going to be hard to do. Anyway, it's killing my Mom to know that soon I'll be moving away. Even 4 hours away seems to far for her. I don't forsee myself compromising my first choice college for a mere few miles drive.  Choices? - Good lord! What colleges do I even begin with? I have so many places in mind I'd love to look into, but it's already Fall of my Senior year and I haven't travelled to visit any of them. Ah well, I was told to buy the U.S News 100 Top UNiversities and Colleges( sometihng like that) so I guess thats where I'll start.  Money. - Wow, school hasn't started yet and most of us have spent a couple hundred $$ on senior pictures alone. I didn't know public school was expensive. haha. But I mean seriously, there is so much you have to buy just because you're a senior, blah blah blah.  Thats enought o ramble on about for now, I'm about to go to bed.  T  Cruising the Local Hot Spots. - There are two sides to cruising. The Good, and The Bad. The Good. - People who are simply out at the local fast food places looking for people to talk to to pass away the time. They might be showing off their possessions(girls, cars, etc.) but they are generally there to pass away the slow time that has engulfed  Madisonville. A few ways to describe this group are: not routy, not loud and obnoxious with thier huge subwoofers or spinning out every time they go to pull out of a place. The Bad. - Yea, this right here is the reason everyone hates people crusing out in town. I've experienced it first hand, and I hate it too. The are loud, and want to "show off" their ride. Be it a V6 Camaro(also known as SLOW) or a 1986 Ford Bronco II, it doesn't matter. They both have bald tires, and by god!, they want everyone to turn and look as they peel out every 10 feet through the parking lot. One of the biggest problems I have with this is the fact that it's dangerous. Usually there will be 10+/- cars lined up against the side walk, and it's not exactly a good idea to make your vehicle lose control while driving around this $100k worth of cars. Thats not even considering the fact that with those 10 cars are atleast 20 passengers. Another problem with these people are the fact that because they act stupid, local law enforcement are forced to come and remove everyone sitting in the parking lot, be it peaceful or violent. It doesn't matter, but by golley there can't be a soul sitting in that parking lot. Thats the basic jist of it I suppose.
