Kinda understanding dimensioning the variable thing.  I understand the concept of dim'ing a variable but when to do it is another story.  We are getting to play with a few more things in the gui such as the track bar, check boxes, and radio buttons.  I would have to say that so far I am enjoying this class more than the previous go figure its the first class I actually get to program and understand what I'm doing ;)  Till its time to blog again PEACE!
