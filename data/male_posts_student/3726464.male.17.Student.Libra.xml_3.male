I can't understand, Cuz it hurts like hell, To think you felt so terrible, And couldn't even tell. I won't understand, It was just so wrong, You didn't have to leave me, As though you don't belong. Now I feel so empty, And everywhere I turn, There's always something missing, For you I always yearn. And it hurts me very much That you didn't say goodbye, Just left one day without me, Left me here to cry. I don't understand Why you felt things were that bad, That you just gave up everything You ever knew or had. I'm sorry I didn't know, I'm sorry I wasn't there, Now I'm here all alone, You left, it's just not fair. I can't understand, How could you leave When I need you so much? In return, you make me cry. I won't understand I'll never make it without you, It will never be okay...  Dedicated to someone veryspecial,  I miss you...
