Sitting there and shit-chatting our lives away. English was such a fake, not only had we gota put on our mask infront of our special guest, I actually swept the whole classroom.Not to mention about recess, Huilin threw the ice at those kelings, and those kids think that I was the one who threw that cube. How could I have done that when I don't even have a cup of ice beside me? Well, I suppose they caught their scapegoat due to that of how enemy we are towards each other.
