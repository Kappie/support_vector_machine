We start to get worried as the dayof the release of HKCEE result is approaching. I won't probably see new friends in F.5 again in September. When I was in the first month of being 4E member, I didn't feel good as the classmates are naughty. Now I appreciated them, they really made the atmosphere in the class well. I enjoyed being with them since they are funny. I felt a little bit sad when I realized we are going to seperate.  This is the last week of July. My long holiday have passed for over a half. I had done nothing meaningful in the holiday. But I think I'll try hard to do more meaningful things from now on.
