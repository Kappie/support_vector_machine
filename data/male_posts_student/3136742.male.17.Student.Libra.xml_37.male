There was NO work to be done. So I sat on the leather couch watching the creek overflow and read almost half of For Whom The Bell Tolls-- and I got paid for it!... Farkin'-A Oh! and the Tranny came in! His/Her visits are always the highlight of my day.  I've been bored... I'm actually thinking about [gasp] going to the beach or something (now I just need a fuckin way of getting down there... I dont know... I'd rather go to the mountains but the weather's been too unpredictable for camping.  I'm just realizing now how much time I used to spend watching porn, and I'm totally shocked... Back when my computer was in my room I must've been averaging 4 hours a day. It's been a month since my computer's been in the basement (read: month of no porn or masturbation) and I've almost completely lost my sex drive. After surviving this long I feel like I've reached a level of enlightenment or something. Any consideration I've given sex recently  has been purely philosophical, not.... what it used to be. Maybe this is like the delirious confusion that ensues after hypothermia sets in... I'm parched in a desert of involuntary celibacy. Maybe I just need sex to get thinking right again... Or do I? I don't feel like that.  could somebody please explain to me what the FUCK is up with Lindsay Lohan?     1. She just turned 18, and look at those tits. Not only are they disgustingly fake, hell, nevermind. Let me just dwell on that; those tits are disgustingly fake..... you could probably use them for a bike stand. 2. Is she TRYING to look like Jessica Rabbit? 3. Doesn't she know that girls that look  that  Irish are really not attractive at all.  I would love to punch Lindsay Lohan in her $200 fake tits.
