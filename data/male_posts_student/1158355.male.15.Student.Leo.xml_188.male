We also made chips ahoy milkshakes, farely decent. Today I just slacked off, I'm no where near done with my homework and I haven't once talked to my love in the entire day. YAY! She just responded. Anyways, I was playing this pong game where if you win, you get a new nude lady. It's the best game since parcheezy. Ok so I've decided, tomorrow I'm gonna watch all my Winnie The Pooh movies including Winnie The Pooh's Grand Adventure. It brings me back to the good old days. Today I also looked at my old photo album. God, the memories, the looks on all the little children's faces. So Winnie The Pooh it is, and Matt just informed me he doesn't watch Winnie The Pooh. What a fuckin loser. Anyways, I gotta bounce outa this site to finish up my homeworkizzle. Cya Dudes...and notorious chicks. Notorious HUGE?
