Ok, so Becca and/or Carissa, or anyone,A Cinderella Story, you and me! Also, The Notebook!! EEks summer is not over and we all need to hang out! Carissa, tell me some more about that concert thing, it sounds cool. Ok you guys i have been having these weird dreams all summer. A new one happens each night. Ummm, but i don't think i should be talking about them online. Call me if ya wanna know. Everyone, if you see Jen at Orlando, make sure you give her a hug, because right now is her last week in Michigan. I think she might be having a hard time. Just to let you know. Hope to keep in touch with you guys! Much, Much Love, Rach
