"It is very likely that intelligence officials were pressured by senior administration officials to conform their threat assessments to pre-existing policies."    urlLink Full Story   The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has released a report "that found Iraq had ended its [WMD]programs by the mid-1990s and did not pose an immediate threat to the United States before the 2003 war."  There  are  sane people in this world after all.  How long before these people are branded as unpatriotic traitors?  Any bets?  Oh yeah, one note about a big story I missed on my "time off".  I just have to give a big 'ol thumbs up to Rush Limbaugh for being a total junkie.  I mean, I knew that he was a complete fuckhead to begin with, but holy shit dude, he pulled out all the stops on this one.  He even stays loyal to soul-crushing corporations in the process by having the good judgment to get hooked on an actual pharmaceutical (OxyContin/Hillbilly Heroin - Purdue Pharma of Norwalk, Connecticut) rather than a street drug.  Even in his misdeeds, he proves how devoted he is to furthering corporate interests.  Call it trickle-down dope-o-nomics.  Have fun dealing with the tough on crime sentencing policies courtesy of your buddy Richard Ashcroft.  Not that I actually believe he will ever be charged with anything, but hey, it's fun to dream.  Christmas came early this year, thanks to you Rush.  Excelsior!
