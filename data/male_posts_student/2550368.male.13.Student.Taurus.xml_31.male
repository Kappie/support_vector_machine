Isn't Jeffsworld.blog a personal site?" yea. Ok so its just another one.. happy? Good. I uploaded some things i'v made in photoshop (Couldn't upload 'em all because of my 10meg quota) check it out man. Looked at it yet? No? Oh :-(.. Now? Ok cool see not bad eh? Thats what I do in my spare time when i'm not posting on the blog or adding on to the blog or making things to donate to me. So check it out.. comment on this post and tell me whatcha think.
