Experience a keg-tapping ceremony, Bavarian brass band and German food and beer. The event, Sept. 18-19, is highlighted by the World's Largest Chicken Dance, led by Grand Marshal Eddie Money."   Just try and tell me that doesn't make you want to clear the calendar in September and start planning a trip to the Queen City.  Try.  You can't.  And I'll see you there.
