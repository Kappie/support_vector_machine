     
      So, I'm off from work early, which is great because I'm tired as hell and I want to take a nap...  Good god, I've turned into my grandfather...  Anyway, I'm getting really fucking tired of rain. It's been raining here pretty much all week, and we're having flash flood warnings around the clock...  And, to top it off, I don't have any TV thanks to shitty SBC Yahoo/Dish and Roadrunner/Time Warner Cable.  Acutally, I've got the only TV, that does have channels on it, in my room, so I get the joy of having my stench-filled brother in my room if he wants to watch TV. Oh joy...
