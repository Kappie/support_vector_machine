I WAS babysitting. So I end up coming home around 2:30, a little later than projected, I was sorry for that, I didn't expect that. My mom is waiting at the door, need I remind you that this is the lady who is ALWAYS yelling because she doesn't get enough sleep? She tells me that I will "not do this again." She says that, "It's 2:30 and I'm worried about you. And your dad wasn't happy you were babysitting anyways." Okay, 1) Why didn't he say something before I told Alyssa I would babysit with her, and 2) Why would she be worried, it wasn't like I was at a party, I was babysitting with 2 other people.  So, that was gay. Oh well. Amy assures me all moms are like that. So, I guess I won't be babysitting again, I actually have fun there. The kids listen to me. I'm sure my parents do it on purpose. They don't trust me.  Screw them.  "Parents were invented to make children happy by giving them something to ignore."
