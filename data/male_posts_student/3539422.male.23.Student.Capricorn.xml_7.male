The report confirms that we are engaged in an epic battle against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism. Despite the relentless criticism being unleashed on President Bush by Michael Moore’s "documentary" Fahrenheit 9/11 and other "expert" media talking heads, Bush has once again been vindicated. Many of Moore’s accusations are put down in the report, for example, that there existed a Bush-Saudi connection prior to 9/11. It’s simply a fact that we have not been hit with an attack since the events of 9/11, and that is a success story. Clearly, the steps this administration has undertaken since 9/11 have prevented further attacks. The Patriot Act, much scorned by the Left, has been remarkably effective in identifying potential terrorists and terrorist cells within our borders. Despite cries of civil rights violations, not one case of abuse has been proven accurate. The commission report says, "Although we are safer, we are still not safe". The report does levy some criticism of both the Clinton and Bush Administrations. The fact remains that Clinton was in office for eight years while Bush was only in for 8 months. Nonetheless, we must look forward and act to ensure we do all we can to prevent another 9/11.   The policies of this administration have shown terrorists that their actions will not go unnoticed or unpunished. While some claim that the Iraq war has actually increased terrorism, or the likelihood of a terrorist act, I believe the opposite is true. According to the president, the former regime in Iraq was a gathering threat to the United States. President Bush never used the term "immediate". His goal was to address the threat before it became an imminent one. This is a vital component of his doctrine of preemption. We can no longer wait to see a threat gather, because then it may be too late. The alternative, to wait whilerouge nations build upillegal arsenals, or whileterrorist cells organize under the watchful eye of such nationswould be dangerouslyirresponsible.The fact that Libya has since voluntarily opened up to the world and no longer seeks illegal weapons can be seen as a positiveeffect of the war in Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have also stepped up their efforts at rooting out al-Qaeda cellswithin their borders. Certainly, there remains much to be desired, in terms of major societal reform of many Muslim countries, but I believe that important first steps have been taken. These countries know that the United States is serious when it pressures them to seek out terrorists in their countries. In addition to rooting out terrorists through force, Muslim leaders must reform their education system, which regularly indoctrinates young, poor students to hate Christians and Jews. This is a serious problem in Wahhibi-dominated Saudi Arabia and in the poor, rural areas of Pakistan. The war against terrorism is a multi-pronged effort, which will inevitably involve dangerous battles as seen in Iraq. We needstrong leaders like President Bush who will make the difficult decision to go to war if necessary when the security ofourpeople is atstake. Preemption is a vital element of the Bush Doctrine in 21st century warfare.As important as the physical battle is the evolution of Islam itself to face modernity and Western civilization. Islam must do anexaminationof conscience and realize that if it is to remaim a relevant religion in the21st century, it must facedown those within its fold who seek to turn it into a religion of terror.This will involve religious leaders uniting to condemn, without qualification, violence in the name of religion.
