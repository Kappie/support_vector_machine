I need more original writing in here  There once was an Arabic King named Munkaicy Maiunkeidew. He had a very loyal servant named Alhizeer Ipstoyulompistromelya. Alhizeer loved the King, and someday wanted to be released from his term as servitude for the King so he could be friends with the King and go to his marvelous parties and enjoy the wonderful company of his vivacious friends and, of course, the King's 24 karat gold plated toilet. Only the King and close personal friends could relieve themselves in this strange, but extraordinarilly comfortable toilet. Alhizeer worked extra hard to try and earn his freedom, but it was not enough for him to become a free man. He had to think of more that he could do. At last, after many a night of comtemplation and meditation, he had an idea. "I could build him a shrubbery! Then King Munkaicy will relieve me of my duties as servant and make me a friend of his! I had better get started!" The servant worked and worked, each day harder than the day before. He had paid for the majestic shrubbery with the small amount of money he had been saving ever since the beginning of his tenure as a servant for the King. At last, the moment came: Alhizeer presented the shrubbery to King Munkaicy in all its splendor and glory. King Munkaicy looked at Alhizzer and said, "Alhizeer, this is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. I know you have been wanting to escape from the chains and shackles of servanthood, so I shall release you." Alhizeer was so excited by this statement by the King that he broke out into tears. "I thank you from the bottom of my heart, o lord. Maybe now I could become a member of your circle of friends?" The King thought for a while, and replied, "Why, yes, Alhizeer, you may certainly be a member of my circle of friends! Why don't you come visit my palace festivities tomorrow?" Alhizeer was overjoyed at this opportunity, so he immediately went home and went to sleep. The next day Alhizeer woke up, got dressed, the usual. Come nightfall, he walked to the palace. He waltzed into the corridor of the ballroom, expecting people to greet him and offer to serve him drinks, but he saw none of the sort. He saw the King at a small table near the back of the room, and ventured a trip to go sit with him. Alhizeer felt like royalty when he was offered a seat at the table by a well-dressed servant. Alhizeer began to propose that there should be a toast to the King for all he had done for the country, but was rudely interrupted by a man wearing a nicer turban than himself. Alhizeer stopped talking and listened to the man. " He might have something important to say ", he conjectured to himself. The man began to speak: "Today, gentleman, marks the third anniversary of the day I first polished this table!" Alhizeer thought to himself,  "What a stupid thing to say! Why is he telling us that?"  Alhizeer decided his toast should take place right about then. "Excuse me, gentlemen, but I would like to pro--"  "Ahoy Mateys, have you ever had so much to drink that you think you can fly?",shouted a portly gentleman to the left of the King. Alhizeer grew angered. He kept getting interrupted at the table. Alhizeer decided that he would just be quiet and listen for a while. However, party after party, Alhizeer kept getting interrupted and stayed quiet.  "Maybe someday I will get a chance to talk" , he wondered to himself. The years passed, and Alhizeer kept waiting for his chance to talk. One day, the King invited him out for lunch. Alhizeer was quiet for most of the meal. "Why are you so quiet?", the King inquired. "I do not have anything to say. Everything foolish that I could possibly say has been said already, and everything that I can say that would be wise is not heard! I have run out of things to say because after the moment passes they mean nothing to anyone. What should I do, O King?"  Which character fits you the best? are you..  The King? The interrupter? Alhizeer? Or are you the retard who asked if anyone has had so much to drink that they thought they could fly? Think about it..
