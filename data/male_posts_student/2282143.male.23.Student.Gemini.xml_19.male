Anyways, still no new years plans for me or Sam.  I just dont know if I have the desire to do anything or not, even though I do kinda want to go out.  Maybe.  I dunno.  I've just been very down lately.  Could be the season, could be alot of things in my life that I am maybe possibly starting to second guess.  About places, things, peoples, and futures.  Im not asking for a storybook life, but right now things are just a bit too fucked up for words.  Well, I need to go do something with my day, otherwise, I will just end up brooding more and things will only get worse.  Brooding is no good.  Learned that in abnormal psych class.  The more you think about things, the worse it gets.  I think Im starting to actually believe that.   Happy New Years Everyone!  I just hope 2004 is a bit better than 2003 was...
