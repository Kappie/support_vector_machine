I guess I'll go kinda random on the whole shit, so here we go:  yesterday was AWESOME-  Me, Johnny, Diana, Yen, Shirley, Kelly, Aliccia (excuse me if ispelled that wrong), and a few other people went to watch scary movie 3 yesterday afternoon. The movie wasn't n't go for the movie anyway ;-). I havn't seen most of these people in months, it just felt great.   bonding :) - Me and Johnny felt a LITTLE bit ignored when we got there. The thing is, we were only a few feet away from the group, and it took them about a half hour to notice us :-p. I can not begin to say how good it felt to be around all my pplz. The thing is, right off the bat I was like "woah ........ what am i doing around all these cute gurls?" ya know? I noticed that I become a completely different person when I'm w/ a lot of gurls as opposed to a group of guys. I get a lot more laughs too which is pretty kewl. Anywho, on to the sub-title topic. I think the person I bonded w/ most was yen. The thing is, we went to elementary school together, and when sutter came along, we jus didnt talk. We (me, her, johnny) went up to the furniture area of JC Penny and sat down to just talk. We told stories and talked about stuff. At least until we got kicked out. Afterward, johnny gave me a few people's screen names. I got to talk a bit with Kelly which was kewl cus we hit it off pretty well when we started talkin. When we were waiting for shirley and kelly to arrive some people came up to us with a camera and asked for a short interview. Me and Aliccia were the only one's willing enough to go for it so that was pretty kewl. During the movie i got to sit w/ diana which was awesome, by the end of it I was practically sleeping on her lap :-p.  Good times :).  chats- I had some good chat sessions w/ a few people. With Lisa we were jus catchin up on stuff, she wouldn't believe me when I told her she was cute but she knows she is. I especially enjoyed my talk with lynda. lisa had asked about my love life, and seeing as i wasnt talking about much with lynda, I asked her that question. apperantly she doesn't want a relatoionship because they bring too much drama. Not to disagree, because I know they sometimes do. However she neglected  the joy and happyness relationships bring. I know you've gone through a bit of crap but don't let one bad experience keep you out of the game.  I asked about her best guyfriend and she told me bout him.... too bad i dont remember much about what she said about him. Then she asked me to choose my best gurlfriend. WOAH waaaaaaaaaaaay to hard a question, she's already heard about Ave so I had to say someone else. I just picked out of random and said Diana (not to devalue you at all diana, wuv ya   Alright more into my wuv life. As most of you people should know by now, I not only like 1 gurl, but 3. Its sucks so much :-p. It jus gets confusing.  Ave, Angleica, Diana...... do you guys have to be so awesome?   school's been kewl lately. I just got my grades and I improved a bit. we took the IUE on monday, it wasn't as bad as i thoguht it would be. I really love my 5th period. its right after core so i gots stuff to talk about. i gots gary and aaron and mary and sarah and kelley and a lots of other people. they all rock. speakin of kelley thoguh, ok, that is my wuv right there. you're awesome kelley :), wuv ya!   umm, thats pretty much it. Im just watchin a queer eye marathon right now. Ill post later....... L8R!
