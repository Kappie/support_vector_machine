And I didn't even know you were leaving or anything?  Goodness gracious.  Anyways...great band name, eh?  Thought of it last night while I was half-asleep.  I thought it was quite an inspiration.  lol cuz the initials would be DBW and you could say it like "Debuwah".  lol Like a retarded Deborah.  That's my mom's name!  Isn't that the uber-peachiest?  Okay...so maybe not.  Anyway, I went to the JV football game today and we won, 42-0.  lol go LC JV!!  yay. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
