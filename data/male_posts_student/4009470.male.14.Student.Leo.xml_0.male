It is currently at a temporary holding site as the school is being rebuilt at site. It looks a lot like the old Rosyth!  :-)  Fortunately, it is raining quite badly and the activities start at around 10 am, so we spend a lot of time drawing buses and trains (lame!). No one from our school actually bothers to cheer (waste our breath) and we either play UNO, chess or talk incessantly.        At the end of the games, though not all games have been played, there is this prize-presentation ceremony. The girls seem to be leading all the cheers and rejoice and they shrill! Our school does not even bother to cheer as we are very   sian   and we are very humble (lolz) ... some schools shriek though getting third for soccer or carrom ... with of course the girls leading ... wonder why ...       After today, I wonder why do they (the girls)have to shrill to show that their school has won something ... i remember one competition in which even RGS girls (i m not lying) also shrill when they won something!        Wonder if this is just been supportive and passionate for your school or just trying to be EXTRA and at the same time adding to noise pollution.       WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ARTICLE/REFLECTION?
