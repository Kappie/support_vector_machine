He is a tall, lanky, barely 20-something looser that didn't even have a shot with her until  he started to talk to her, complement her and hang on her every word. He came over to our table and engaged in small talk for a hot minute. When he left she leaned in and wispered 'I just don't know what it is about him, but I feel something.'   There seems to be one common bond between my lady friends: they all still have a soft spot for the exes. In my personal experience I have never wanted an ex back for anything but a one night stand or a week fling. But I didn't give a damn about any of them.     I give a damn about Leslie.   I don't want to be with her again. Fuck I don't know what I'm taking about. It's 6AM and I slept 4 hours.
