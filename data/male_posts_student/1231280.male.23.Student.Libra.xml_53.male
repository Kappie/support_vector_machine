The guy from Budweiser says, "Get me the best beer in the world, the king of all beer, a Budweiser."  The guy from Coors says, "Get me the best beer in world, made with mountain spring water from the Rockies, get me a Coors."   The guy from LaBatt Blue says "Get me the best beer in the world, ay, a LaBatt Blue don'cha know."   The guy from Guinness then says, "Get me a Coke."   Taken aback the members from the brewery club asked "Why aren't you getting a Guinness?"  The Guinness president replied, "Well, I figured if you guys aren't drinking beer, neither would I."
