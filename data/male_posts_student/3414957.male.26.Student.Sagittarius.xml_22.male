These kids used to always fill that waterfall/pool area with soap late at night or early in the morning and that always made me laugh as I drove by. I haven't seen the suds in a few months now and I am getting worried that those kids haven't been keeping up of the town moral with their suds duties! One time, I think it was Halloween, they put red dye and soap in the waterfall. There were these huge red foam bubbles everywhere! It was great. My hats off to those guys!!!!
