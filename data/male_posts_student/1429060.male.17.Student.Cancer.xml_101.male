It actually proved to be most fun; the people there were nice and funny, and I saw several faces that I recognized but did not realize were from white station. Miles was, as always, lovely and fun and I enjoyed being around her. I appreciate that she asked me to come.  Guess who I also saw? Lela! Lela lyla lily, daughter of my father's friend. She is so precious and adorable and grown up now! Haven't seen her in an age, which is actually several years. God. I want to jump on her and hug her and steal her away with miles. That's what I'll do. And we'll all run away to Paris.
