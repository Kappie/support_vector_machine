I need to get caught up still in English and the quarter is winding down.  I can't believe how fast this quarter and year are going!  It's almost JUNE PEOPLE!  Today was good.  I am waiting to hear from my instructor on what she wants done with her web site.  She was going to E-mail me files today and I haven't received them.  I'll probably start building her page and then input the information she wants it to have when it becomes available to me.  I spent a lot of time socializing with Jerryn (shirt lifter) and Jackie today in the coffee area.  Jackie and I boy watched, while Jerryn tripped over his tongue over girls.  The boy is one horny SOB...he's a str8 me, but much cuter. LOL  Jackie was right about his butt though, but like I told her, easier access to the hole. lol *blush* JUST KIDDING!  English went well and then Web Design wasn't bad.  I was tired though at the end of the day and hungry.  I went to Skipper's by myself and had dinner.  I came home about the same time Dale did and he and I looked for my keys again...NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!  What the Hell?  It's the craziest thing I have ever experienced.  They are just going to show up in the strangest place I'm sure.  This evening I was tired and didn't go to QUEST.  I just have been looking for my keys, working on homework, and chatting.  Tomorrow for not having school, I'm sure going to be busy.  I am getting cards for my Mom (19th), Uncle (21), and friend Rod (21).  I have a lot of errands to run and many things to do.  *sigh*  Hope you had a great week!  I rate this a B-.  I would have been higher but I didn't get as much done that I would have liked to.
