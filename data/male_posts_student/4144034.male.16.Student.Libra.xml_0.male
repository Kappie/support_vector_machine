GOD DAMN sweetheart, hate me forever. What's the point in a society where you're censored because you might offend Christoholics? If you're a Jesus freak, you don't belong at TFN anyway. And who was the "god fearing" culprit in this case? Oh ho ho, no more than the infamous Strilo. The one and only oddball on TFN who would happily ban me anyday. He's also the one that just had to insert himself in on my last banning and lied completely to me. I don't want to get into details in that arena, but the fella really pissed me off period. Oh, what's the deal here?  Is he keeping a watch on my posts looking for a chance to ban me? Hmmm, i'd like to give him some credit but frankly i don't owe that bastard anything. I'd still be in a perma-ban right now if it wasn't for the help of Kimball_Kinnison from TFN. Without him, i'd be pretty much screwed. I don't know much, but from what i do know he defended me untill he made sure i wouldn't be permabanned. Due to Strilo's sick intentions, he knocked off a month of my last ban so i wouldn't get some of the heat for that. A sidetrack for that was that on my next ban, there would be another month knocked on. Under the circumstances, one slightly might think Strilo might want me to get banned, doesen't one? He has perfect motive to...and hell, he's ever the opporotunist. I can give him that. Beautiful. Simply beautiful.  Well, either way i guess that means i'm banned for at least 1 month and 24 hours. That son of a bitch. I can't go back to Kinnison asking for help this time...i doubt he'll take any more bullets for me. I  don't  want to break our agreement. I don't even think i got out of line by saying "god damn"...but i can't...i can't go back to him asking for more help. Whatever my banning is...i guess i'll have to take it as it comes. No matter how dumbass it is.  What will i do for the next month? Well, i might do some posting over at  urlLink KillBill2.Net  and my favorite art community on the internet,  urlLink deviantART . It sucks donkey balls that i was banned for this when others can simply get away with saying "i'd bang her like a screen door" in the JCC, but pricks will be pricks.  Over and out.
