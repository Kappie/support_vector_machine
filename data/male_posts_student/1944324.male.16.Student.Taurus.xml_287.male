I snapped on five people today including both of my choir teachers.  So I figured it would only start a flame war.  So now I'm going to apologize for not explaining myself on the D topic, concede that I should have, and agree not to discuss it here.   I will not make the same concession for webcomics unless you do for TwoP, The West Wing, and basically every T.V. show you talk about that I don't watch.  You are holding a ridiculous double standard. Now I'm going to go take out my random, inexplicable anger on virtual characters in Super Smash Brothers.
