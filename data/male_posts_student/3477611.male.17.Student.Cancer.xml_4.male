No more smoke filled rides blaring Music with people staring And long nights of finding  Out who we are And where we’re going. No more late night talks And park-side walks. It’s all gone out the window. You’re not here anymore.  The more that I feel lonely The more I wish that you could be Here by my side Be here with me. Your bronco’s cold from somebody Not keeping it company Wish that I could keep it company.  You’re so far gone, And I’m on the run From my feelings. Just come back to me And we could be Finding ourselves trying To be happy.  If I could have said the right things, If I would have been that “right guy,” Would it even change a thing? You’re so far gone That it’s hard to keep in touch, anymore. Admit that you were wrong, Come back to me, And open up to the world.  You’re so far gone, And I’m on the rum From my feelings. Just come back to me And we could be Finding ourselves trying To be happy.  Don’t you want to be happy?    here ends the love making session
