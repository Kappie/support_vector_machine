Our new Freeview box with a hard disk recorder came through the post as well, which we got Â£100 off of through my dad's work. It's pretty cool, you can pause live TV and record anything you want to the 20GB hard drive.  I came home from school early today because games isn't on again, and I've also ordered my digital camera and portable storage device. The camera should arrive by Friday and the PSD next week, so that's definitely something to look forward to.  Anyway, I must go and get ready for today's last meeting of our Young Enterprise company. I need to prepare a 30 second speech thing to read out about my experience...
