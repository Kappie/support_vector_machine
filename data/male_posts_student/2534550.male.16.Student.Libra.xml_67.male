Since i spend all of my time in napa some of u have never seen me in a non-proper setting and yes kids i can be "black as helll"  the story: so its Sadia's b-day, we're having a really good time at the ice-scating rink and our friend falls hella hard and these kids start laughing at him and us. As we walk by we say to eachother stuff like they shouldn't be laughin and stupid shit that wasnt really meant for them to here neway (some of it was however) neways they go and tell there parents that were picking on them and totally fabricate this huge story that just keeps getting built of lies, to the point were two stories arent even the same btw some of the kids.    so the worker comes and talks to us and tells us that we shouldnt talk to the kids and she'll tell them not to talk to us. and i say "what the f*** i got 2 talk to dem 4? and if i want to say somethin i will" (or something along those lines) so long story short we just keep skating. soon after there mother who didnt go into the rink not once the whole time we were there walks up 2 Sadia and my sister and starts yelling at them so my sis cuses her out. so the lady comes in and says "you need to leave the rink or we'll call the cops" so i say "what da f*** u gotta call da cops 4, ill call da cops my damn self its free on my phone." (haha i have so much fun) so we're outside and i ask for my money back because she was kicking me out w/o no reason and raising her voice so i cussed her out. she said she was going to get her manager or whatever and i said "i dont need to talk to that f**kin' hoe" and we left.  i was so pissed the whole time so much that my eyes were like blood shot red and my ears were hot and things that i normally wouldnt say were justa rollin' off my tongue, but then it was so funny and i relieved so much stress that i decided im not going to talk shit from people nemore, and so in closing i've decided ice-skating trips with Sadia, Chelsea, and my sister rock hard!!!
