If any other super-cool, majorly hot girls read this ((Thomas, you listening?!))...Marten's definitely worth crushing over!!   Anyway, I went to a concert last night!!  And moshing has developed some muscles in my legs that I didn't know existed!  It's painful, yet exciting, because I just thought my legs were devoid of muscle.  Haha.  Anyway...great day today, and this band name's so super great! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
