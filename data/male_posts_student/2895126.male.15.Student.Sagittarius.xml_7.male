Please don't assume anything here; I hate those things and am sincerely convinced that they're one of the worst things ever to happen to me as a child. Anyway, I had several "stars" (the "rare" ones) saved, some of them "holographic." My littlest brother, Ian, still fancies them a bit and "found" the stack. Now I had wanted to keep these until, in my old age or perhaps in a few generations (or maybe in another 1000 years) when they might actually be worth something. So my brother insists that they're his. Normally, you'd expect a parent to intervene in my favor, seeing that although I really don't like them and I haven't touched them in a while, they're still mine.   But mom didn't. So I went on a little thing about justice and about how it definitely wasn't just that she could give something of someone else's to someone without their consent. I am therefore censored as "RUDE" and silenced at pain of whatever parents can do to make your life miserable.   So that sucks. I'm considering writing "A Treatise on Parental Justice and Maintaining a Just Household," but I know she would just punish me and not read it. After all, I "think I'm always right." She is a hypocrite.  On a less condemning note, today there was a fire drill at work (for those of you who don't know where I work, I wash dishes at a retirement home/convent for scholastic nuns.). I had no idea where to go. I just ran upstairs to the entrance and luckily, that's where I was supposed to be. It was an interesting experience.
