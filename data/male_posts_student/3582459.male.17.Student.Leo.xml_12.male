And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (Matthew 28:16-20, New International Version).  16Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 17When they saw him, they worshiped him--but some of them still doubted! 18Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given complete authority in heaven and on earth. 19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 20Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age" (same as above, New Living Translation)  This passage, commonly known as  the great commission  is a large part of why Christians try to evangelize--here, the resurrected Jesus commands his apostles (the eleven) to make disciples of all nations. Often we say we should evangelize without really understanding why, taking the bolded text above out of context and having evangelism exist in a vacuum away from the other parts of our respective walks with God.  It's interesting to see the progression of reasoning in Jesus's speech: "I have authority over everything, so you should teach other people about me [the word disciple literally means student], about my commands, and I will be with you forever." So somehow  Jesus's authority over everything naturally leads to teaching others about him.  What I have said so far is not interpretive at all--it's simply what Jesus said. When I think about how the two ideas (Jesus's absolute power and spreading the gospel) are linked, basically two reasons emerge: first, reverence for God, and second, the best-thing-since-sliced-bread phenomenon.   What do I mean by reverence for Jesus? I mean that it is natural for a person who is aware of an incredible man (someone worthy of reverence) to tell people who are unaware of that incredible man about him. For example, imagine that Jesse lives in an area where nobody reads the newpaper or watches the news, so no one is aware that a great new president has been elected. It is natural for Jesse to tell the ignorant other people about this new president--this new president is just so powerful and worthy of respect. Similarly, it's natural to spread the good news about Jesus because Jesus in personal form was the greatest man to ever live, because he was fully man and fully God, master of the universe, with all authority in heaven and on earth. I think this reasoning process is emergent from the passage.  Now onto the best-thing-since-sliced-bread phenomenon (hereafter known as the bread phenomenon). The most momentous event in any Christian's life is coming to know Jesus; everything else pales in comparison to befriending, knowing, and being the child of the god of everything. I realize that knowing Jesus is an incredible thing, and think it's just so great that other people should get a chance to know too. It's kind of like discovering an incredible new invention that is the best thing since sliced bread--it's too awesome to not share with others, only instead of an invention it's an incredible friend/creator, and instead of best thing since sliced bread it's best thing ever. This reasoning isn't explicitly eminent from the passage, but it definitely is substantiated by other events in the Bible, such as with the various healings, when people were healed and ran around telling everyone how great Jesus was.
