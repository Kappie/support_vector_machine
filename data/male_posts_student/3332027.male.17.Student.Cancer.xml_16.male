Thursday night i told my parents and i needed a break so i told them i was going to go to the city to see Shrek 2 with my friends. (The truth is I have no plans and i just wanted them to know i was going out just incase I make plans during the day.) So i got my $40 and come home at 10:00 P.M  Ok now its Friday, woke up got to first period on time.....BLAH BLAH BLAH. Nothing happened until third period when I went to the Cosmetology class. I called my friend (who is my ex that I cannot get enough off)to find out what he was doing today. It was 9:00 A.M! LOL, he wanted to know why i made plans so late. I told him i want to go to the movies and then get something to eat. He wanted to know if i got money like that. I told him i had about $45 on me. (truth is I had $35, cause i bought food that morning.)He said ok, and that I was going to take the 12:30 boat. I also told him to call my phone before he gets on the ferry.  Well after gym, I got the call. He was leaving his house on the way to see me. I told my teacher (who's the fucken coolest cause he lets me leave when i want to) that I needed to go today. Today was the practice Practical portion of my Earth Science Regents. Lisa, a non-student school assosciate/para got mad that i was leaving again! She told me I needed this and I was like, "whatever been there done that, YATA YATA YATA, more important things to move on to" I stayed anyway just to see the lab and do atleast one. I ran out of the class at 12:20 running for the boat. I got to the boat as it was getting ready to leave. I was the last person to get on and I was soo relieved. I got to the other side at 1:00 P.M looking for him. Like a retard, I caleld his house. (I'm a little paranoid, what if he doesn't come like the last time..(but hey i know that I have to take chances) the first train came and none of the people that got off was him. I bought an unlimited metro card and waited at the train station until he got off. I only waited about 5 minutes. He asked me what i was doing there. I told him i was waiting for him and i bought an unlimited metrocard. I bought him an issue of complex magazine since i know he likes that and XXL. We walked to southstreet seaport while he read the magazine. We walked into South Street Seaport Mall. I then decided that i want to go 42nd street. As we walked to the station, I told him i need to go back on the island. I told him about what my mom said and we hopped back on the boat. I showed him what i wrote on the boat and then i asked him how he puts up with me. I think what I wrote on the boat scared He just turned away and listened to his CD Player. We got back on the island and walked up the block to my school. He stood about 5 feet behind me as I waited for Jasmin to do me a favor. She was tired and was on Chris' shoulder. (There is something about Chris I don't trust, I think he's shady and I have always not trusted him when it came to Jasmin.)After that, we went to the U.A on Forest Ave. The bus ride was about an hour and we had to walk another 10 minutes because the bus doesn't stop in front of the theatre anymore. We saw Troy which was extremely good and Van Helsing which was extremely crappy. After that we went to McDonald's to eat and went to the ferry 'cause I had to go home. I went with him to the ferry and made him sit with me at the benches at the baseball stadium. At 11, he took the boat and went home, and so did I. I felt closer to him today. Spending time with him brought back feelings and memmories. In my head, we're still together. I guess I built that illusion in my head because the reality of it I can't deal with. He told me that Truth Hurts. I told him reality hurts.  Since our breaking up, I never told him that I went on 2 blind dates. My friends have all told me to get over it and move on. They tell me that I should Fuck him and not even bother talking to him at all becuase he's an asshole. The truth is.... the people they set me up with were assholes. There the most rude, self-centered, mirror-loving, shallow people I've ever met. They make me look like a saint. I even tried doing something annoying to them that i would do to my ex. They got pissed and annoyed. Lucky for me, I had a way out, I told my cousin of my situation and I got her to call me every 30 mins to tell me to come home. I would say a keyword if it was ok for her to stop calling. I would say another keyword if they should call back again. Out of those 2, they lasted 30 minutes with me. After that, it made me appreciate my ex more. He gets me, he understands me, and he can put up with me. Since that asshole from PA left my life, I started to become attached to people. My ex is the first person i became truly and lovingly attached to. I want to work on myself some more so if we do get a second chance, I want us to be perfect. I just wished he was still with me in that way while we were ourselves out. Hanging out with him today, I also hoped that maybe we'd comeback to eachother. Hey wishful thinking doesn't hurt.(Well except me since it was my wish and he wishes to establish himself by himself.) He's the only one who truly gets me without knowing that he does. Tomorrow is a new day...............................................   "Cause you get me When nobody understands You come and take the chance, baby You get me When none of the pieces fit You make sense of it You get me You look inside my wild mind Never knowing what you'll find And still I want you all the time Yeah, I do Cause you get me Yeah, oh, yeah, oh"
