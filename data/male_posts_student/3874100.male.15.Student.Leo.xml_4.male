The comments from one of the staff, my deme warden (No idea how he got this name, he doesn't really have anything to do with me) said 'Doors are being shut', which my parents got very hung up about, not that I even understand what it means. *shrugs*  Anyway, Music/IT/Business Studies/Chemistry weren't to bad, where as german/english/maths/physics were quite appauling.  Over-all - not impressive.  I also have to see this deme warden fellow at 10am on the tuesday before school starts again, meh, I don't get up before 1 in the holidays, but I don't think asking to re-schedule this 'til about 4 is a good idea, I think they might interperet that as pushing it, and well... being rude.    Anyway, in other news, I've just got off the phone to my friend and partner in rock (how cheesy?) Zi, and it seems we're spending the whole of tomorow night going through golden-eye on the N64, from scratch.  We're hoping to finish it...should be fun.  I'll report tomorow with hopefully some good news, Jonny.
