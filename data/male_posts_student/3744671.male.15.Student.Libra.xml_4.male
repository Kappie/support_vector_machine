For me, this was the number one reason for shelling out hundreds of dollars to get my Xbox!  This game has countless hours of gameplay because of it's replayability, sure there's a single player campaign, but once you beat that you have the amazingly fun multiplayer with tons of different modes from deathmatch, to a tag type game, to capture the flag, etc. However, to me, the single best aspect of this entire game is the co-op mode. You and a friend can play the single player campaign together co-operatively via split screen, absolutely brilliant!  The graphics are stunning, the audio is stunning, it's got spot on controls, great mission structure, cool enemies, a memorable main character who's already spawned novels and action figures. Also, this has one of the best stories in a game ever! Obviously seeing as they've already made three novels around this whole story. Also, for once you're A.I controlled teammates are smart! They'll even start shooting you if you kill too many of them! Halo offers a nice array of difficulty settings for beginner players to hardcore gamers. A novice gamer could play the game on Easy or Normal mode and still have fun without being too discouraged, whereas a hardcore gamers can play Heroic or Legendary and still find a challenge worthy of hardcore skills. Also, all these dificulties are available from the get go so no matter how experienced you are at gaming you can have fun without having to worry about breezing through the game in a day, or getting too frusterated to continue.  If you like shooters, you'll love this game, if you'll love multiplayer games to play with a friend, you'll love this game, you want to host a LAN party, you'll love this game. Bascially there's something here for everyone!  I don't think I can find one problem with this game to be honest.    Rating:  10/10      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
