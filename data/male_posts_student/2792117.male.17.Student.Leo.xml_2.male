IF all this really leaks out, i don really mind lor, coz i somehow gave up this unit liao.  In these yrs in np, my memorial events r esp. NDP 2003. Then my Camp Sapphire 2003, Sec.2 Atc, fellow squadmates in the same old unit, n of coz my squad (B 2003) then B 2002.  Many frenz were made in NDP 03, all frm diff unit all across sg, suffering under e hot sun every sat. n ended up having red arms n hands, face n of coz a 'v' shape on e neck. The sorching heat we had in the parade ground except when our umbrellas opened... E times in indoor stadium, when eating pizza n KFCsss. Oya, got once when we dono waiting 4 wad, someone asked me how old am i, n she called me 'ah pek' aft me revelling my age to her... becoz i was 1 yr older.. haha...
