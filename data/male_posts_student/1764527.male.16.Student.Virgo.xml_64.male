 I itch like a motha f'er. At the cross country meet yesterday the place I had to stand to make sure people went around the cone had about a kajillion mosquitos. They tore my @ss up. It was really bad. I have so many mosquito bites all over my face, head, neck, arms, chest, legs, basically everywhere. It is awful. It itchs so much it hurts. Aaaaaaahhhhh!!! 
 Yesterday was my birthday and it started out pretty good. But, the mosquitos and something that happened when someone said "ur not hte only person in this world george" kinda bummed me out. That comment is making me think of the futility of something I'm doing. And now a deep, philosophical question: Why is it that when someone knows you like them they treat you like shit but when they aren't sure that you are totally committed they treat you so well? I don't know the answer, only that person knows it. Camille told me she used to play those kinda games and the only way she stopped was when she realized that she was messin' with people's minds and forced herself to stop. She said nothing can help someone come to those conclusions. Shit for me. 
 Ah well, life can be a bitch and there's nothing I can do about it. The key to change, in my situation, lies squarely on someone else's shoulders.
