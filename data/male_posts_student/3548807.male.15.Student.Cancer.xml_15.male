But it seems that everyone actually no not everyone..but some people know about me and my..uhh mate may i say?  and i'm not mad or anything about it but i was just wondering...are we that transparent that they can tell? hmm maybe i need to work on my subtility. but i'm thinking now...i should be less secretive about it if everyone knows. i mean what's the harm that'll be done of it if everyone already knows. i mean even writing this blog makes it a bit obvious, but hey...fuck it. *sigh* but i know what i have to do. i need to talk to her...and i shall very soon...infact i mean the next time we can be together alone.but it had better be before i'm gone for an entire month...that's something that i now wish i hadn't really done now. because then i could've spent more time around. but i guess i had no idea about the recent events...so i guess you chew what you've got, then maybe you can go up for seconds.
