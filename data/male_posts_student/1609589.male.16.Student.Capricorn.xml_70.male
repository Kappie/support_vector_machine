For those of you in my English class, you know that Journal assignment we had to do, where we made up rules for our family to follow? I came up with another one.  3. If I have to help clean up for my brother's birthday party, then he has to help clean up for mine.  I'm excited about the lockin.   Looooooooocccckkkkk iiiiinnnnnnnnnuuuhhhhh.   What sucks is that we're supposed to help clean up the Horizon Players play, and i don't wanna, cuz I'm already sore, and i just wanna have some FUNNN...  I don't even wanna sit and watch the play, because the only reason i'm coming to this is to have FUNNNNNN.  And if they stick to their little schedule, it won't be.  Rebellion!
