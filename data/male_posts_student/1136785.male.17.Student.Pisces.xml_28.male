Well, not really - but I can be waaaaaaay more emo. And isn't that what the people really want?   I need to stop giving sam all my good links on instant messenger, now if I post them here I'm a thief. Well played, Mr. Ryan, well played.  Not much is going on here. I volunteered at a soup kitchen today, which was cool I guess. Just for dinner. The staff there has some interesting characters. Like the fifty year old pudgy, pasty, short white head guy who has several raps like "Thugology" and "Mr. Bondsman". Not bad. He didn't get a callback to the Apollo last year, but he has some connections this year, so see him there. Or the construction worker on the staff who can speak six languages - farsi, arabic, french, spanish, hindi, english. He acted mostly as a bouncer as volunteer workers are too non confrontational to reject people who ask for seconds before everyone has been served once. A brawl almost broke out too. I'm planning on going two or three times a week I think. I need the hours and I need something to do. It should be cool. We actually worked through dinner today, so we got free food at the Buttery, which was nice, even though I wasn't hungry.  Spent more time with the girl - still not really interested.   I feel like I should be doing something more here, but I don't know what. But that's summer. Even a summer spent learning arabic.   Being part of a goverment bueracracy is like being in kindergarten. Jesus Christ.  urlLink Apology time  - soon they'll have nap and juice and graham cracker hour. All at taxpayer expense too. And you know they'll get the expensive fancy graham crackers, not the cheap store brand kind. Fucking greedy kilt wearing bastards. God I love parliament. The first thing to come out of anyone's mouth is not how stupid it is just on principle, but because their opponents would need much more time then alloted to properly apologize for misleading their government. We're excited when Cheny drops the f-bomb; they're amazed when a fist fight doesn't break out.
