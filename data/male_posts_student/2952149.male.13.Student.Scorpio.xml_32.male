But then, once I got to school, everything seemed to get better. Oh and yesterday I went to the Yankee game. It was fun even though they lost...TO THE DEVIL RAYS! A total embarrassment. I was happy to see Stacey so cheerful today, but then she said she was taking Zoloft lol. She wrote me an E-mail telling me how much she hates her life and I want to help her sooo much but I know I can't :( Though I am happy that she feels she can trust me which she can. I think she and Thomas were flirting a little bit in 5th period which made me feel kind of weird. I am going to go to bed now, I am really tired.
