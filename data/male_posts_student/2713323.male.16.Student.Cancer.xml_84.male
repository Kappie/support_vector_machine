Hope you like it.  time. 9.50pm Hi, my name is terence. is it weird for your dog to sit on your lap when you are only  wearing your underwear? i guess so, time to get off hotrod.   I own a gentlemen's club called Tj's. i am the relations manager, road girls show up on  Mondays and say hello to me, because I’m the guy you check-in with, if you’re a road girl,  on Mondays. Any sexual excitement I get anymore in this job comes from the road girls.  It goes like this: I’m a guy, and on a boring Monday afternoon, A 20-year old blonde comes  into the office, shakes my hand and introduces herself, and in one hour I will see her  breasts, for free. Many guys think that i have the luckiest job in the world,  lemme share with you the insides of the job. The dancers stand in the DJ booth naked,  they bitch at me because I screwed their schedule naked, they order food at my desk naked,  they use my phone naked, they come in the office and tell me the toilet has broken down  naked, they sit across my desk and cry because their boyfriend is a jackass naked.  I can’t look anymore! I’ve seen too much! I know every mole, every scar, every birthmark,  every nipple, I know if a dancer has put on 5 pounds.  I have 5 other people managing the place for me.   Daniels my bouncer. Hes 50 years old. He is rather huge and owns a ponytail and mustache.  He’s wiry and strong. He was in the military and knows martial arts. He doesnt like to  fight and he knows how to avoid one. As he says, “Don’t ever fight a guy you don’t know  unless you absolutely have to. You never know what he knows, or what he’s capable of…or  what he has in his pocket.” Dan removes unruly customers quicker and more efficiently  than anyone else in the club legally. illegally, well, ryan holds the torch.  Ryans a contractor and I once destroyed his bicycle. He’s a huge guy,with a mustache,  long brown hair. He once touched me some way and it was so quick. Tap, and I dropped  to one knee from the pain. I learned the hard way that, when you’re very drunk at 3:00 am,  going really fast down a hill on Ryan's bicycle is not the smartest thing to be doing.  I nearly lost an arm, not to the crash, but to him.    Eden looks kind of like Jackie Chan same hair, similar face, same build.  He was the victim of a burn accident that I think won him a bunch of money  in a lawsuit. His hands and forearms are badly scarred, his hands are almost  unusable. When he flicks you, it’s the best he can do with three fused fingers.  He calls it the “trio-bird”. I love the trio-bird. Sometimes when somebody says  something stupid, I nod over at Eden and he pops the trio-bird like he’s offering them a  cigarette.    Jonathan looks like Jonathan. He sells and services video games and juke boxes and pool  tables (including ours). He also doesn’t drink. Hes in love with one of the dancers,  Bulldog(she’s one of our veteran dancers who was here long before I started). He’s not  gross about it, though. Shes is very nice to him and doesn’t take advantage of the fact  that he would give his life for her. They’re good friends, but it’s the definition of  an unrequited love.   Kelvins a male stripper.He has a reputation for dressing up like a construction worker  or a fireman. He dances to songs from Burzum or Impaled. The fireman costume has a huge  length of actual firehose that he stuffs with something to make it rigid. He would then  swing the hose and dangle it out over the crowd and all the women would scream and try to  grab it. He was always careful not to let any of the women get hold of it, i saw it once.  His hose dropped about halfway out and started to dip down towards the crowd. Before he  could pull it in, one of the women grabbed it and it was all over. It just disappeared  into this screaming group of women and nobody ever saw it again. We did find out later  that he packed it with the Styrofoam peanuts.  Ok, im tired. I just finished a game of tug-of war with a few buds of mine using dildos  the size of my arm. Time of completion. 11.03pm  sorry ah hui if i woke u up...love ya! muacks.
