( desmond , me and tim) went to toa payoh sec school to take the container first then we went around toa payoh, novena, bugis, balestier,united square to do collections. haha it's so crappy. i keep on approach girls! haha yaya so expected of me right?.smile. they was even a group of girls who even ask me if i'm tired or xin ku or not. hoho! i was so amused by them. i realised that actually singporeans can be quite generous lehz. for me, almost 75% donated at least 1 buck each lor. there was even this one guy at toa payoh who donated 10 bucks leh. SHOCKED. it's ten lorz! i mean i would normally donate 20cents nia. haha. shame shame boo! tim and desmond also did very well. tim la. so many 5 bucks and damon got so many 2 dollars! haha so happy that we three collected so much money. true la it's kind of tiring, esp the back! good experience.
