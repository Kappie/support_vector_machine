Ok kiddies, story time of how this one here, ie me, screwed up majorly and is suffering from the consequences, but not really.  Following me?  So, some of you have heard this and some of you haven't, but I don't really care and feel like ranting anyway, so sit throught it, grab a cup of tea, and imagine me saying this in a really really LOUD voice.....so here it is...     So yesterday, I received an email from a Izho@hunter.cuny.edu, and I figured, "hey, it's from hunter, why would they be sending me crap, I should open this."  Then, it led to a blank email, and a download.  Naive me, thinking, "well, I did sign up for some session thing, and the heading was 'information', it's probably telling me something about it."  So I downloaded it.  And as I tried to open it, it failed, couldn't open, I was kicked offline, and could not get back on without it freezing.  I mean, I just feel stupid.  I should've figured it was bad just by looking at the email...imagine ghetto talk... I'z a hoe !  Come on, I should've known!    But funny thing, it's just messing with my aol 9.0.  I went into my windows explorer and was about to delete the 8.0, and decided, "eh, why don't I just try", and it worked.   Yay!    Oh, AND my anti-virus doesn't work!  Anyone can help with that??  I think I'd need it.  So there goes my rant...my LOUD rant and I hope you all enjoyed me talking to myself in front of my computer.  Thank you and good night.  *And close curtain*
