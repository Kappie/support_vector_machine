It wasnâ€™t really the young man who was humorous and a little nutty in the brain (although he smoked way too much), but his little Jack Russell Terrier.  This was no ordinary dog.  Whenever his owner got into his big, red, off-roading truck, the dog would jump in.  The man would leash up the dog to the bed of the truck and would begin to drive off.  The dog, whose leash was pretty long, would manage to walk out the back window of the cab, stand on the tool chest in the bed, and put his front paws on the roof of the cab, and bark like crazy.  Anywhere the dog was, so long as he was in (or on) the truck, he would bark and bark and bark.  (It was actually more of a yap.)  We could always tell when our neighbor left, because his dog would yap our ears out all the way down the street.
