I'm probably going to redesign the autohaus webb website (again) but make it very very good and am figuring out how much to charge, what to do, etc... I think I'm going to make it really cool this time.  Anyways, I had braimstorms while trying to fall alseep, so I woke up to jot down my ideas.  Schools started and thats fun.  I like all my classes and teachers except for ap calc.  I love calc, don't get me wrong, its just that the teacher, to all appearances, is boring as hell.  I hope to find some method of entertainment in that class.  My last two periods of the day are both directed study (aka do whatever I like for a grade) so thats a nice way to end the day.  uhm.. yeah.  bye
