First, I had been given the opportunity to finally make something of myself, and Scarlett had had to go and be nosy and ruin it for me. That was thepart of me that was dreading spending this much time with her, so close, yet so far away. Being with her was just bad for me. The other part, the part that was making me stare at her butt as I thought, was saying that maybe this was the opportunity I'd been hoping for, to prove to her that I was a 'real' man. You know, good for something besides talking to. I could just see it - I would save her life, she'd fall into my arms - only no. It probably wasn't even real.  Scarlett said something, interupting my train of thought.  "Huh?" I said, "Sorry, I wasn't really listening,"  "I said that was really weird. Who do think they were?" she asked.  "I suppose we'll find out tomorrow at 6 pm," I said looking down at the slip of paper. "Can you get there, or do you want me to pick you up?"  Scarlett looked shocked for a moment. "You're not actually think about going, are you?" she asked.  I was a little surprised; I thought she knew me better than that.  "That's what I said."  "Ian, are you insane?" A few people turned to look. "You don't know who they are! They could be kidnappers! Lord knows what kind of ransom your grandpa would pay for you. I really think this is a bad idea,"   Then why did you agree to it?  I thought. That's the problem with Scarlett. Well, one of many problems. She's impulsive. She's also paranoid, but only after she's made a mistake. It makes for an annoying combination. I remember once in eighth grade we were at an amusement park and she decided to go on this big tube slide, you know, the kind with the big inflatable rafts? It had been raining on and off all day, so there was barely any line. Anyway, we were in the raft when she realized she really wasn't dressed for a water ride. Of course by that time it was too late. She was cold and wet the rest of the day, and none of us enjoyed the ride because she was complaing the whole time about getting her clothes wet. That was kind of off topic, but the point is, Scarlett isn't good at planning things out. She acts on her feelings without thinking first. I'm very surprised no guys have taken advantage of that.  Anyway, back to what I was saying. The problem here was that she was right. I had absolutely no reason to trust these people. Nothing but a gut feeling. Was that feeling really worth the risk? Of course not!  But then if I'd ever put logic before feelings, Scarlett wouldn't even be a part of my life right now.  "No one's making you go," I finally said. "But this is my desicion; and I, for one wanna see what it's all about,"  "I'm going with you then," she answered. "I'm your friend and I'm gonna stick by you in this. But maybe we can take some sort of safety measure. Call the police, or get-"  "No!" I interupted her. For some inexplicable reason, her perfectly reasonable lack of trust in these random people was making me mad. Looking back it may have been a jealousy thing; you know, like 'how come you can think straight and I can't?'. All I know is, I snapped.  "Look," I said, "You can go, or you can stay, I don't care. But don't try anything like that. It's..." I honestly couldn't think of a reason. "It's justnot gonna end well," I finally settled for.  She just looked shocked for a minute, then the impulsiveness kicked in again.  "Ok," she said "I'll see you there,"  Then she turned for the door.
