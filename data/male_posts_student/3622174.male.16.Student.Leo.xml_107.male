I'll be gone most of the day.  I have to work both nights, but, oh well.  Then, Wednesday, I'm at home, Thursday, I'm at home, and then Friday, I'm supposed to be going to either Busch Gardens or Universal Studios.  Unsure yet.  Then, the following Monday, vacation begins, and I'll essentially be gone for two weeks.  I come back from yearbook camp on Thursday, at which point I'll post the picture portion from camp.  Then, Friday morning, I get up at the crack o' dawn and head out to New York.  I'll be back from there on August 2nd.  Then, that only gives me one week before school starts.  Hard to believe it's already coming this quick...2 weeks ago summer was going so slow, and then it sped up.    So, don't be expecting too many regular posts here for a while.  I'm gonna have to go audio.  Digital Lust is essentially going to be closed until I get back from NY, with only a couple more days of updates.  I won't audio those updates.    That's it from me for now.  It's going to be a busy day for me, I think.  So, that's it.  See ya later!
