Dynomite is not for use with mouths.  This is a valuable lesson, because when forgotten it leads to lots of corrective dental work.  And speaking of corrective dental work, The country of Nigeria is soon to be taken over by hungry penguins.  However, this is not as bad as it sounds.  Because soon after they've taken over they'll have lunch, and then they'll be normal non-hungry penguins.  and everyone knows that nonhungry penguins ae easily removed. Now onto wax: No. And now, onto the fifth chapter of the wombat.  A long time ago in a small glass jar, there wasn't a wombat.  Wasn't?  Uh oh, it must have escaped!!!! Oh no!  Watch out, it could be anywhere. Except Atlantic city. You know why?  Cause ur mom, that's why!  Boo-Yah! In conclusion, if you see my sanity, tell it it can stay in Hawaii, I'm doing just fine without it!   I only have one thing left to say to you, and it's that my pants are on fire!!!!
