External is basically a condom that does the same thing, just without the pesky urethra probe that, when put in wrongly, causes scabbing.    I've had the foley.  I wanted the external.    The external is also called a condom catheter, as well as a Texas Catheter, or a Texas Rig.  In fact, one of the doctors on Daniel's rotation asked him why it was called a Texas Rig, and if he could find out, he'd get an A for the rotation.    He put me on the case.  And here's what I know:  *Texas catheters were called that as far back as WWII, when bomber pilots would hook up to them so they could pee during flights.  Often with leakage.    *Texas Catheter is a trademarked name.    *Cyberculture author William Gibson uses the term several times, both in opus NEUROMANCER and in short fiction.  *Texas has been known to inject people on death row through a catheter...granted, probably not the penis kind, but it's the nomenclature they use.    But no site on the web is devoted to the grand question, "Why Texas?"  There are some terrible jokes about "Everything's bigger in Texas" or "Texans can't do it otherwise" or something stupid.  But nothing I can find otherwise.    Help me.  I can't sleep without knowing this.
