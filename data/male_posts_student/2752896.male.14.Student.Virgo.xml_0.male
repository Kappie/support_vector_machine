Went on: -Tomb Raider (They wouldn't let my on with my glasses, ergo, I was blind) -SpongeBob Squarepants 3D (Disgusting Pickle Allergic Fish) -Psyclone (Greatest view of Wonderland) -SledgeHammer (People threw up all over the place after this ride) -CliffHanger (Tis where I think I lost my cellphone) -The Bat (The best ride yet!) -Dropzone ("Oh My Fucking God!!! Oh, it's over already?!") -SkyRider (Tis where I discovered I lost my cellphone) -The Fly (Keep your hands up for this ride!) -Top Gun (GREAT starter!) -Vortex (Do this when twiddling your thumbs!) -Dragonfire (This was boring, and painful) -Wild Beast (Your arms have to go up for this one too!)  13 rides in 10 hours!!! W00T!!! ----- Lost my cellphone somewhere in the park. Not good, still waiting for the call from the park, but it was most likely dropped in the water, so it will be useless anyway :( O well. Now i get a new phone! and they're taking the money from my allowance to pay for the phone =( ----- They just phoned me 5 minutes ago, telling me they found my phone!  YEAH! Only, it might/most likely will be useless anyway  Leave a Comment Dammit!
