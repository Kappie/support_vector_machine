Haiz, e girls, dono wad to say, they went home leaving their bags at mac, and becoz of some prob between yanting n lester, heard tt she wanna break up wif him. So maybe becoz of tt lester du lan n went back to sch, dono he like to go back school for wad, as today got training, hope he don’t go n let go on e cadets, r I should say my ex-sec 1sssss whom I treat them well n I will always treasure the moments I had wif them. As for this yr sec.1s, I should say is actually none of my business liao be, e sec 4s so like to run the show so let them be lor, but e prob is tt e way they control is lie dono wad, look at them juz feel like hac-care them liao nowadays. So, after Wilson n yanting made phonecalls, he n one fren including mi went to her house, haha, even though I juz met her 4 e 1st time today, n as you may think wad 4 I go her house, company Wilson go lor, poor thoing tt he hav to carry 3 more other galz school bags, n also her house is juz beside my block lor. After Wilson past the bags to the galz then I went off liao, n they went into the house, dono wad will they do inside also, sec.1 galz n sec.4 bois…. Haha, wif no other pple around.. whu noes wad will happen? But I believe nth will happen lar. 	Hmm.,. mi hav to finish my exploration of ideas as soon as possible lor, but e prob is tt I don hav e mood to draw so many stuffs lor, but still hav to press on, this year taking Osss wad to do?
