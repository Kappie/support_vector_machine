(and alex is fixing this because he's too lazy to copy/paste but not too lazy to make it a link.)   urlLink choice 1    urlLink choice 2    Since apparently gold/gems are out, I guess simple stuff is in, and those remain simple but are still very nice.  I personally like both and need Kim to make up her mind lol.  Come on, I got 150 dollars burning a hole in my pocket.  Its crying to be used.  :)
