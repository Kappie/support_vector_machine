As if there wasn't enough things in the world to grimace at my virtual world, I mean our virtual world is taken over with even more things to grimace at. Shock, horror! Oh not the internet..........  Pretty interesting story @ : http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/29/1085641754841.html  I don't know, was it the pain? Was it the boredom? Did he feel stuck in the lift..... ok no more plagarism from now on :/  I guess you can make the world as beautiful as you want it to be, inside you.  Enough rambling by me, time to camp out on msn :P
