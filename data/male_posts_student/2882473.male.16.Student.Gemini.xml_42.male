I'm fairly proud of myself today, I've gone through the whole first chapter of the Seperates Sciences revision book, and learnt most of it. Oh how interesting it all is, about micro-organisms and how to preserve food, and what happens at a sewage works. Yep, I'm glad I learnt all that. No, really, I am. I bet none of this stuff will even come up on the exam, and then it would all have been for nothing. But it may do, so I better learn the rest of it. If I can get the next chapter or so done this afternoon, I should be going fairly well. However, I   SHOULD  be revising for a German listening exam, which happens to start in about 22 hours. But then HOW exactly do you revise for that? A glance through my exercise book won't do much. I suppose I could learn some vocabulary, but that would be amazingly boring. I'll probably just have a look through my book, to re-assure myself that I actually did do some revision.  In other news (I like that phrase) I have been continuing to practice my skills on a diabalo, which isn't too hard. I can now catch it probably about 3/5 throws. Although I have been trying some higher throws which proove to be more difficult. And then sometims the string gets all tangled up. Meh, all it takes is a bit of practice.  Oh, and I just played one of the most annoying games I have ever played. You can find it  urlLink here . It took me well over an hour to complete it, and it has a really terrible ending. And that was WITH a walk-through guide, although I only used it towards the end when it got really tough. Oh well, best get back to me revisin'    Reading:  Interesting Times  Listening to:  Reasons to be Miserable  Watching:  Armegeddon last night, ok, but too much America being great crap.
