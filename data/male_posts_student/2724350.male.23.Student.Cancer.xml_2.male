Although the storyline may be crappy at times, there are some things in the drama which set my inquisitive mind to work.   A friend of mine once told me humans like to find someone to identify with, irregardless whether they are fictitious or not. I found the thinking of one of the male lead quite similar to mine. In the drama, he was very pessimistic about his life and doubts everyone. However, things took a turn when he met a girl he liked alot but did not accept him initially.  Such scenarios are quite commonplace in everyday life. Boy meets girl. Boy changes because of girl. Girl leaves boy. Boy changes back. However, what struck me was something the male lead said about  blaming everything to fate and shrugging off all responsibilities.   Since my JC encounters with relationships, I was very upset about my life and seemed to fall into a bottomless pit. It resulted into a vicious cycle as I pushed everything to the back of my head and left my life in a lurch. Things turned from bad to worse when I entered the army as the culture turned me into a more introverted person. Fortunately, I was brought out of the darkness by a campmate and he showed me the possibilities of happiness.  Things seemed to brighthen up alot for me as my perspective about life was changed drastically to a more positive one. But, I was still prone to relapses of semi-depression and skeptical about people and their intentions. I finally found the root of all my problems when I heard what the male lead said. All the while when I was trying to solve my problems, I was actually running away from them. But now, I have a different challenge:  To face my fears and not run away from them.    I will end this session of self therapy with a quote of mine.  Not every love story has an happy ending, but the start of a happy relationship definetely has love.
