Well, in news around the world, Oregon recently announced that they are trying to make it legal to carry 6 pounds of pot, for medicinal purposes. Skip a beat. What the hey. You know how much pot that is?  Enough to fill up 2 shopping carts. Two whole shopping carts.(Without the kid in it of course). Now Thats just crazy. 6 stupid pounds. Its illegal to have more than 2 ounces in any other state. (Cept califonia, there just wierd about drugs). Alright, now back to the normally schedualed update.   Hokay, this week we got off of our lazy butts and made a Holst  urlLink Upload  . And even a  urlLink New Song . And, the meta has been re done for this site. So, after we get crawled, all you have to search for is massiveattack0 and you will find this page. Aint that great?We Now bring you, electric avenue, by Eddy Grant  urlLink Electric Avenue
