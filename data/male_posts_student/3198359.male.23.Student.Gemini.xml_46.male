Now, I'm in now way affiliated, associated or own any shares in this bank, but what I can say is you're Australia and pissed off to the max for paying fees for "service" that you never actually see being delivered, I suggest one of two things, check out your local credit union or join up to Bendigo Bank.  If I decide to move back to New Zealand at the end of this year, ordinarily I would have gone back to National, however, since Lloyds Bank of England sold it off to some Australian jokers, their service has gone from great to average then to, "If they were running an emergency department in a hospital, every patient would die".  Well, if worse comes to worse, I'll have either go to either HSBC or Kiwi Bank; which is the old "Post Bank" from days gone by; lets hope the Tories are voted back in under the title of "lets sell every bloody thing we have".
