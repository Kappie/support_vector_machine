Of course not, but it happens time and time again to me. Perhaps a little dramatization (and a horribly witty and unrealistic one I might add) will help:  Person A- "I care about you." Person B- "Well that's awesome, because I care about you too. Let's have babies." Person A- "I care about you, but I cannot be with you." Person B- "Shit." Person A- "I know, but it's the truth. I wanted to be honest with you, because I didn't want to pretend I could continue doing this, and end up hurting you more in the eventual end, when I cannot bear the pain of my falsehoods any longer. I care about you, but there are things going on in my life right now that prevent me from being in a comfortable, intimate relationship with anyone, not just you. I wish that things were different, and who knows, maybe one day they will be and we could try again, but I cannot continue to be with you right now. Please forgive me." Person B- "I don't understand." Person A- "But I just explained it to you." Person B- "If you really and truly cared about me, you'd just completely rewrite the inner workings of your mind to suit the yearnings of your heart and prove that love exists the way movies and songs make it seem, and we, full of smoldering passion for one another, could ride off into the sunset. And make babies." Person A- "Well, I can't really do that." Person B- "I hate you. You're confusing, you don't know what you want, and you've taken advantage of my feelings. Die a painful death with stabbings and such, and rot in an unmarked grave." (crying) Person A- "Right I'll just...I'll just be going now." (exit)  Okay, so that's really dramatic, and no, stabbings aren't often wished upon Person A. And sometimes, yes sometimes, Person B understands where Person A is coming from. But boy is it rare. They've been in the same position before, wanting something they weren't ready to have yet, and trying to save the other person's feelings by being as honest as possible. I suppose I just wish it could work out better more often. It's as though there is a singular moment of incomprehensive language exchange, in which Person A (whomever they may be) cannot successfully transfer their precise thought pattern to Person B, and simultaneously help them to understand, empathize, and deal with it.   I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I hate hurting people. Man, that took a lot to say. Feelings are so strong sometimes. I often wish I could predict them. I often wish I knew who I were to become some day. But we cannot know our fate (if it exists), and if I did, I imagine my mind might implode from contemplating it. I envy those around me who know love, and are comfortable with it. Very few times have I known true peace in the arms of another, and with my life being so full of change and uncertainty as of late, I feel as though I cannot allow myself to accept such warm invitation, without first furthering my quest to determine some semblance of my own identity. I believe in the power of pleasant distraction. And I believe that I would not be able to be true to a companion, if I were not first true to myself, whomever he may end up being.   Too long have I wandered and stumbled down a path of another's choosing. Too long have I taken for granted the comforts and blessings of a giving family. Now stripped of all false identity and misconceptions of who I was meant to be, I must choose my own path. While I have silently yearned for this opportunity for so long, it has now manifested as an unforgiving enemy in my path, and I seem to have forgotten how to wield my own blade.   Did anyone else notice how this entry just completely switched gears?  Okay good, at least I'm not alone on that one. So let's sum up, shall we?  I want to know who I am, and when I find out who I am, I want to fall madly in love. Oh yeah, and I suppose a nice stable and well-paying job would be helpful, with some free time on the side for nonsense. Can I get fries with all of that?
