NOw mine is so0o0o0oIMalex and hers is so0o0o0oIMerinn and our fonts match too, its the awesomeness.  so i basically sat around online all day and then erinn and I went to see anchorman but stefan didnt want to come =(.  BUT... anchorman has to be the fuckin funniest flick i have seen in a while.  im not even gonna describe it, just go see it now.  it was worth the nine overpriced movie ticket bucks it cost to see it.  seriously its the best...crap, its sunday isnt it?  shit, no conan tonite..
