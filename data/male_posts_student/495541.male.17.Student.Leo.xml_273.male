I think the opposite so there is no reason to say that stuff.  A lot has happen in the last few weeks.  Over the spring break, the family went out to Monterey, California to see my brother graduate from the Defense Language Institute.  It was pretty awesome to go out there.  He's now on his way to Texas where he'll be doing some training for a few months then to Georgia for something... who knows?  Hopefully he doesn't have to be going to Iraq.  There's a good chance he will have to go there or Afghanistan.  He speaks Farsi and they speak it in many Middle Eastern countries.  It's weird, but I guess he knew that stuff going in.     As you can see the picture is the SRT-4 logo.  I need to sell the Durango and I can buy one of these puppies.  I'm excited... but at the same time I know someone has to buy the Durango first!  Then I have to get myself a JOB!  School started back up today.  Like normal we have lots of homework.  Chemistry was the shocker.  I have 4 packets due in a few weeks.  Also there is a U.S. History paper due Friday.  Additionally there is an Algebra 2 test tomorrow.  I'm not exactly excited about all that stuff but we'll just have to see how it all goes.  I'm pretty excited this term because I think I can do exceptionally well in my academics.  I have the feeling like I can do well.  I really can say that I have the motivation to do well like no other term before.  It's a good feeling.  I will leave you with that.  Thanks for reading.  Night.
