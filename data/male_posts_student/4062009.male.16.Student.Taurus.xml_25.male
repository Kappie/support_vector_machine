Man, that is now getting old fast. I hope we get to normal teachings soon before I blow.  Anyway, I am going to do those problems tomorrow in homeroom or later tonight. They should be really simple so they should only take about 5 mins to do. Then I have a little language arts to do that will only take 3 mins or so. I can do all that tomorrow but just in case, I may do the physics tonight before I crash.  Anyway, the rest of the day was cool. I got on CollegeBoard.com so look for some good colleges and I must say that there system for searching is not very effective. The search takes all the majors and thinks that I am talking about one college insteal of several. They should have it so that they take each major and see which college does it best. Then we should do the research to see what is better to our needs. To be honest with ya, I like GCIC or whatever better. They have more life like questions that made searching for a college much easier.  Anyway, I did the search there way doing only small amount searchs and I think I came out with 6 or 5 possible colleges to go to. They should all be under $15,000 for out of state which I think is rather good. I need to talk to my dad though to see how much he would like to spend for college and how much he can. It is going to take a lot of work and questions, but I know I will find something sooner or later.  Anyway, that is enough for today. I am going to go watch some TV now. Later!    Wolfwood
