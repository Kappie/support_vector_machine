I suppose Jeff Bezos really knew he was onto something when he came up with the idea to sell books online. The worst parts of the bookstore experience - snooty staff and titles out of stock - simply aren't found online. The only thing they really need to replicate now is the musty smell of old paper. If my computer can output that, I'll never need to step into a bookstore again.  Today at work things sucked the bunghole just slightly. The morning was interesting, we demoed some open box wireless stuff. Got the second router up, physically. We just have to figure out how the hell to get it to transmit to the the other router now. This morning brought us two seperate cycle counts - Dos, which is always a joy, and individual skus - about 13 of them, scattered around the department. One type of CD-R, three or four peripherals, five printers of various sorts, a multifunction and a some monitors. To put this in perspective, A CD-R count can take up to half an hour. So this count was rediculous. I was really fucking pissed off to find it there. Hence I did the only thing one can do in a situation like that. Found out how many we had in the computer and compared it to what I could find. Ram was out, as always, as was one type of hard drive. I didn't bother counting the CD-R's, it's fucking moronic that we should have to count, I'm certainly not going to count something as trivial as those lovely things. Fuck you head office, we've got an Inventory Control Chick (ICC), get her to do it.  There wasn't a large amount of traffic in today. After lunch Rocky had me manage the floor. I pointed a buying group out to Jeff, he sold a nice package. *sigh*  Managing the floor was great. I got to read a nasty letter that was sent to Steve. Poor bastard, some stupid bitch of a customer brought her system in with software issues. We asked her if she wanted her system restored. Whenever a tech asks this they always, *always* mention "This will elminate all data on your hard drive, have you backed up your system?" To which the customers don't listen and just stress they wanted it fixed. So her system was restored.  She then proceeded to demand that her data be recovered, as she apparently did not know she was going to loose all of her information. So we forked out $300 for data recovery software and recovered it. Apparently she received her computer today and it's nonfunctional. I think it's just that this woman is the spawn of the fucking devil and God is punishing her(tm). Anywho, she sent a nasty fax over.  I'd like to meet her just so I can get a picture and show it off to my friends.  Monday at work was a bit frightening first thing in the am. Because it was St. Paddy's and there was a lovely belt of sunshine cascading on us from the sweet blue above, Kevin - in his infinite wisdom - decided to hold the morning meeting outside. Poor fellah didn't know what he was getting himself into.  As we head outside, Steve King produced a cigarette and commenced the process of setting it ablaze. Jerry King (no relation, although they do share some traits from time to time) began to complain, immediately, bitterly and loudly (as only a balding, multiplespawned, broken, divorced former manager of battery's plus/marriage noncounsellor can) about the smoke. The rest of us stare in awe at the sheer level of childishness this man wallows in. Kinger (Stevie) tossed a snarky comment aside and moved to the other side of the meeting. Downwind, thankfully.  Following that sexy little spat, halfway through the meeting a car rockets into the parking lot, parking in the second row of spots. A second car blasts in behind, stopping approximately an eigth of an inch away from the first car. A man leapt from the second car, clutching some sort of neon piece of hardware. He proceeds to stick his entire upper torso through the window of the first car, where the two tweenaged guys inside are now decorating their pants. Screaming ensues from rage man, whereupon he balls his right fist and punches the driver in the face. That's when we notice what he's carrying.  It's an knife - of the X-acto variety. That's when we panic. There could be a 187 about to go down in our parking lot. Tyson begins to approach the guy, at which point I stress to him that a man with a knife generally can't be reasoned with.   At this point I must depart from my retelling of this tale to lace it gently with some commentary. I won't shy from a rumble. I'm a pretty stupid motherfucker when it comes to getting in fights, I haven't been in many, but I haven't lost one in over ten years. However, there's no dishonour in running from a fight you can't win. You don't take a knife to a gunfight and you don't take your fists to a road rage soiree that's currently being attended by knifeweilding high society.  Tyson saw the point but proceeded to say that he was going to get a license number. I pointed out that the license number could be extracted just as effectively from behind the concrete posts whereas the potential from being run over drops 114% while you're behind said posts versus being in front of them. We all retreated to the calm serenity of the concrete apron and got that number.  Talk about whacked.  Later this week I stumbled upon some banana bread, jelly beans, good company and bad pizza.  Three of the things in the previous sentence where hell damn ass awesome. The other one makes me think I might be lactose intolerant.
