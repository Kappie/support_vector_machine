I was so touched that my colleagues actually booked a single room for me... hehehe.... I tried to make everybody's life easier by doing my own stuff like admissions, took my own BP.. almost everything, basically was like a staff nurse in charge of myself.  Was kinda bored coz i came alone.. but then i hang out with my colleagues and help out with the so called "backstage" work. Seriously I was very nervous... Then abt 4pm, Shah came.. yeah Shah the air steward guy... yeah the one who frantically tried to stop me from getting into Arse's hungry stomach... but Arse ate me anyway... He brought his GF along.. shall not discuss that, Nas will get really super angry if he noes, doesnt like me to talk abt shah's gf that much. He brought me apples and longans???? which obviously i wont consume so i "donated" it to my colleagues outside... they were pretty happy.  I basically ate and slept..  NExt morning was the operation. I went down to OT at 12pm.. it felt weird, totally weird that i was pushed on the trolley... ok i had to agree with my pateints that yeah.. it was irritating when they started asking me abt my particulars... coz they kept asking and asking again.. Went from induction to anaesthesia area... met this anesthetist... DR Lee Pang.. eyah... i looked at his name tag.... coz HE'S DAMN GOOD LOOKING!!!! He helped me to get my Ot gown sleeve off.... OH MY GOD!!! kwakakakaka...... haha... no lah hes just trying to set my plug and the sleeve was in the way.Next i saw my surgeon... Uncle Chan Yew Meng..... yeah i picked him to do my tonsils. The nurse gave me anaesthesia... and it all came back.  When I did my squint eyes when i was about 4 years old... they tried so hard to get me to go to sleep. I remember there was this malay male staff nurse... said " adik, put on the mask brethe in and out... just think ur with the care bears floating ard".... AND I DID THOUGHT OF THE CARE BEARS!!! So when I was in the OT yesterday I remembered the whole scene again.. and yes i thought of the care bears... and the next thing I knew it felt like in the matter of minutes... " Annisa, Operation over.." And I got difficulty in breathing and it felt like an asthma attack....so the missy gave me Ventolin:Atrovent:N/S Neb abt 5 minutes... felt so much better... i was more concern of the nause rather than the pain.... then i was sent back to the ward. Sister Chan picked me up.  and she wasnt of any help at all... I vomitted blood which smelles horrible... and i vomitted again... it was so traumatic... I hate puking and feeling dizzy... and best of all thats when i got lots of visitors. Nas, my sis, Arsyad, Juliana, Usha and my parents and uncle came... it was like.... i got a headache... tyhey left abt 9pm. so i went straight back to sleep... Karen and Santhi was on Night so they came and checked on me..  I woke up abt midnight. I felt so much better. I came out met sister Aziah. I ask Karen to remove my drip... and i went back to sleep.. I was so giddy still...  and im giddy now... going to lie down cont tomoro morning.... and my mouth hurts... i cant yawn!!! damn!!!
