He had some entertaining pieces, and when I went to his site, I noted the John Kerry banners. Earlier today I sent him an explanation of the Blog and an invitation to jump in and give us the other side of the aisle's perspective on things. Maybe he'll make Eric happy... Anyway, Danny, if you are interested, jump on in!
