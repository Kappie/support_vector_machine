First of all, I am trying to put the finishing touches on my Beastie Boys website, that will take a couple of weeks, so i'll keep you updated.  I was also asked if I could create a mini-site for Drama at my college to help promote this play that we are doing called "Work, Leisure, Life and Death". I have created a template and finished most of the pages, but I have got to now put the information on the pages now which will take about 2 hours.  I also have another site in the pipeline promoting myself. I decided that I wanted to create a site for myself so that I can put up a couple of promo songs for my album that I am creating.  I have other websites that I would like to make in the future, so keep posted for further info.  Peace
