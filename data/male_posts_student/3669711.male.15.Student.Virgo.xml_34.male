I started trying out iDesk today, a nifty program that creates icons on my iconless fluxbox desktop.  They look really cool once you have it all set up.  Well, i set up one today, and it looked right, but it didn't work.. so that was sort of dissapointing, but i'll figure it out!    On a much lighter note, i was browsing around the  urlLink Think Geek  store, and found several cool things.  Especially shirts, like this  urlLink one .  No, i will not fix your computer ^_^.  At school, my friends and i are known as the 'Laptop Crew', and whenever someone has computer difficulties, they ask us for help.  Naturally, because we are 'Computer Nerds'.  Well, i need this shirt ^_^.  Hehe.   Then there's this  urlLink one , this is downright funny, in a sort of dirty way.  Practice Safe hex, and avoid computer virus's today. Lol.  Then, this  urlLink last one  that i noticed... perfect for all bloggers out there: I'm blogging this."  A subtle warning that you might be the subject of today's rant.  Be warned!
