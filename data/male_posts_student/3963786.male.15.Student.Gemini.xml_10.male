Well me, Trav, and Modder had a poker night a little while ago. I cleaned them out. I won 10 bucks. (not the biggest money but it was still fun.) I don't know if I've told you that I have a cousin in my school, her  name is Aly Fischer. Well Aly's friends has been talking about suicide. I told her the right thing to do, which is tell his parents about what he's been saying so that he can get whatever help he needs. I just hope she listens to me before something bad happens. But if worse comes to worse and he starts talking like that again and she tells me about it and doesn't call his parents, I will. On a lighter note: Dani likes me, Dani is one of Cory's friends. I don't think I'm going to act on it because of the stuff Cory has told me about Dani. She says she's easily bored, doesn't care about other peoples feelings, goes out with people just to  have fun without worrying about comittment. So those are pretty good reason to not like someone and I'll listen to Cory. She looks out for me and if she tells me someone is bad news, I'll listen. Well that's about it for now.
