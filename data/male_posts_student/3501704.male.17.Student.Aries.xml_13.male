In my opinion controlling anger is THE HARDEST THING IN THIS WORLD. ITs temping to release all that frustration by lashing out at someone, u feel better but at what cost. NO i am not talking about anyone in particular, i do not want any more misunderstandings other than the one that occured like 4 months ago..and still isnt resolved yet...sigh. I keep thinking to myself that being angry only breeds hatred.HATRED IS THE ROOT OF EVIl, u keep on thinking on destructive thoughts, u cant concentrate on things that u want to do. SOrry if i sound so cynical, but with all the things happening around me, i find it increasingly hard to suppress my anger....sometimes it just DYING TO BURST OUT, but i do not want that happen..it will not be pretty  Alrite enough about all the unhappy stuff, last sat watched i robot with my good pal, a person who i can freely share my thoughts with. The movie itself was pretty cool, effects were nice.... i like the car..so cool. Makes you think about the future where robots can control the world. Sunday its off to do project work once again..bleahz project work is really a pain in the butt.  From mon to tuesday,every nite was burnt doing project work, typing out the minutes, getting the gannt chart done. IN the process my hw backlog piled up, i felt like crap in school, always so tired. It was a hectic rush for everyone to get the file ready for submission, and i mean really rush, lol doing last minute stuff sure aint nice. When the file was finally submitted i was reliefed.  Wednesday, had learning journey after school went to junction 8 where the class split off to different places to eat. I was at pasta mania with the dc, justina, junjie and a friend of brendan, a female cadet inspector. Didnt had enough cash so i headed over to yoshinoya for a students meal,yup cheap and appetising. For the learning journey, was at CPF building where we had talks and watched a video clip, pretty boring in my opinion.  Thursday was the only day i got home early, wanted to do some work but ended up slacking around. Was snoozing on and off, due to a lack of sleep accumulated over the days.  Yesterday was a better day.After school i went to town with some of my cca mates ivan and andy, to have fun, playing lan games that is. ITs been a long time since i went to a lan shop to play, had macs befored that. Boy was it fun, those few hours spent playing helped me to destress and forget my troubles for a while. I didnt noe cs(counter-strike) could still be so fun after all these years. After that went back to watch some gundam seed again, yes i cant get enough of it, the story is so fantastic. Alrite till next time peeps
