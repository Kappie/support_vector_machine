I didn't manage to see them last time they were here so I'll be sure to make it this time. Don't know who's opening... but who cares? It's Clutch.. for those of you that don't know... check out "The Mob Goes Wild", "The Soapmakers", and "A Shogun Named Markus". They're all really different songs, but I figure that Clutch's sound is pretty well covered.   Ahem... we go now from hard rock to extreme death metal. July 19th at the Commodore, we have CANNIBAL CORPSE with The Black Dahlia Murder and some other band.. don't remember the name. For the uninitiated.. if you've seen Ace Ventura : Pet Detective... you've seen Cannibal Corpse. They were the band playing in that club that Ace Ventura had to go through to see his fish buddy. Are you as excited as I am? LOL.. of course not you dorks... you can go on with your "Postal Service" and "Taking Back Sunday" hippie nonsense. What kinda person listens to that stuff anyways? LOL..   Oh and you haven't noticed, there's a huge thing on the right called Warhead. It's an Otep music video.. not a documentary as some may have thought. Worth a listen though anyways.   Well, this week is study week. So most of my posts for the week are gonna be rants full of explitives, anger, and frustration. But at this time next week, I will be 3 credits shy of being a University Graduate. Wow.. and it only cost me into the 5 digits.  later, FnR
