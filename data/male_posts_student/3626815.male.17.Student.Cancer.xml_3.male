Namely, I went to the library, and $4.50 later I was in possession of the first five episodes of Cowboy Bebop, the Cowboy Bebop movie, and the 4th-6th episodes of InuYasha.        Holy crap. How I have never been exposed to any of this before is amazing. It is now one of my life's missions to see the rest of the Cowboy Bebop series. InuYasha was good too, but I don't think it can begin to compare with Bebop.        Kinda makes me wish I got Comedy Central for Adult Swim. Blasted anti-cable parents.           Spike: I love the kind of woman that can kick my ass.
