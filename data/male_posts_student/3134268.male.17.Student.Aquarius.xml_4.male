One is with the Junior High kids, where we lead small groups with them, and the other is highschool, where its all student led.  They were setting up for worship for the second service, (which lasts about 15 minutes), when we realize: no one has put together a sermon for it. Zach, the head pastor for now, looks at me and Ben and tells us to put one together while they are doing worship.  So I put together a sermon on the book of Romans, specifically chapters 1-3, and I spent an hour or so giving a sermon which I prepared in five minutes. I'm kinda proud of myself...  Anyways, it shouldn't be too long until Brian and Pastor Dan are back.
