I'm not a senior but it sucks for them because it rained like crazy during their senior picnic, and their band really sucked.  I sure hope mine is better next year.  1 week until graduation so 1 week until I'm a senior.  I found out today that the budget was aproved so I have a job for the summer now with the schools.  Full time and should pay about $6.50 a year because I worked with them last year too.  Anyways My AA server is up and named "Running With Scissors" so we finally have a clan and server name.  Thanks Nathan.  I'm gonna go get all that stuff set up.  And join the server everybody!
