They tend to be very patriotic, as immigrants who have chosen to come here and then succeed through excellence, quality, and virtue. Asian's are probablly the most socially conservative group in the world, neverless America. The main values that Republican's bring out and cherish are the same values that Asian American's hold dearly- hard work, prudence, belif in self, self-gratification. But currently, only 30-35% of the Asian Vote goes to Republican's. This number should be much higher, as an Asian American pundit Dinesh D'Souza says, up to 90%. As an American Asian myself, it is very suprising that the majority American Asian vote goes to the other Parties, and not the Republican Party. The core values and spirit of Republican's and conservatives is parallel to the endearing values that Asian American's also hold.  Getting a majority vote of the American Asian population would help Republian's to hold their majority status and essentially win every election.
