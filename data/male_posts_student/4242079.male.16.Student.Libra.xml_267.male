Let's just hope that the problems I was having here only temporary.  So, not a lot has been happening as of late. I have been feeling rather good about everything that has been happening, though.   Last night, I went to see "Intolerable Cruelty". I had never heard of it before, which is surprising because it had George Clooney and that other girl...Catherine Zeta Jones..maybe. It was alright. I was with Kylie and Phaedra, so it would have been a good time, even if the movie sucked. Afterwards, I was on my way home, Driving past the road that goes to Crystals house. It made me think, so I pulled over and called her up. So, we hung out for about 45 minutes before she had to leave for some prior engagments. It was nice to talk to her again though.  Yes. Everything is ok.   sunrise, sunset, you hope for, then regret
