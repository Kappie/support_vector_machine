I had a great time at the dance, but to the disapointment of everybody (except maybe Cassie- do you think I ask her if she was sad I didn't ask?) I didn't ask her out.  I spent a lot of yesterday doing a ton of stuff. Got to haul 5 gallon buckets of water up and down a hill over and over for plants; even though it was going to rain. Then we went to the store for a while. I got some new shoes (as if I don't have enough, but I guess I have grown out of most of the ones I have) while I was there.  I also got to finihs up on the announcements at church, which was Oh-so-fun. I have to do them every week. Kinda stinks, but it's ok. I also get to do the church webpage, but as of yet I haven't gotten to do that because I haven't started. That now makes a blog, a church webpage, and my webpage that I have to keep up with. Oh the joy.  I'm working on my webpage right now. I'm working on getting my menu up. Right now it doesn't have anything on it, and the colors would clash with the colors on my site. But that doesn't bother me much that it's not up, because there's nothing to link to but the blog. I plan to change that pretty soon. Most of the link will point away from my site, but that doesn't matter because I wouldn't want to bore you people out.  Speaking of which, I think I'm going to leave now. I might come back later on tonight, considering it's only 1:39 PM now. I'm still trying to get on every other day, but so far it hasn't happened.  PS- I'm on page 55. and the book  Burning Up  was written by  Caroline B. Cooney .
