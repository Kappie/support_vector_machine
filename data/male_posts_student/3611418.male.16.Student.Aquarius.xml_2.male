'Tis plenty a calm like dropping balm; Love's weather is so fair, Like perfumed air, Each word such pleasure brings, like soft-touch strings; Love's passion moves the heart on either part; Such harmony together, So pleased in either. Sealed with one will. With love God made man one, yet not alone. Like stamps of Kings and Queens, it may be seen: two figures on one coin, so they do join, only they not embrace.
