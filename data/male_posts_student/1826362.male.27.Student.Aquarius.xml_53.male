On the one hand, I feel like they are evil, like the Yankees, driving out small buisiness, employing sweatshop labor, taking up vast amounts of land in the suburbs, contributing to urban sprawl, and the like.  But then there's the part of me that loves the store.  I can get everything all at one place, and it's cheap.  (I got a nice shirt for 3.98, and three pairs of cute boxers (55 percent cotton, 45percent polyesther) for 7.99.  How great is that?
