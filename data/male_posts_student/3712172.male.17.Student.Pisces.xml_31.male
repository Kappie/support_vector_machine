My bedroom is all done and painted now, and tomorrow we are going to do the walls in the main part of it. It's starting to look really good.  That's basically all I have done today, I went to bed really late, or early I should say. Alley  Ty came over around 3am, so we hung out here then went to Robins for coffee, I didn't get home until about 5:30am. And then to top it off I didn't fall asleep until around 7am. So I slept until about 2pm, showered, then went off to the new place to paint.  That would be about my day in short. Nothing interesting, nothing fancy. I didn't have any time to write tonight either, so no poems today as well.  I realized something I wanted to post the other day but it slipped my mind. I was listening to Janet Jackson's old Rhythm Nation CD from '89, and I was really impressed with the lyrics to some of her songs and interludes about the world. The one in particular I thought was so well thought of goes as follows:   In complete darkness we are all the same, it is only our knowledge and wisdom that separates us, don't let your eyes deceive you. - Janet Jackson   I really like the use of equality in that quote. And if you ever had a chance or get a chance to listen to songs from Rhythm Nation, such as  "State Of The World"  or  "The Knowledge" , take some time to listen and appreciate her lyrics. She is truly one of a kind, and her mind is where it should be. Even though some of her new stuff is more sexually oriented, she's my number 1 favourite artist, and she knows how to make kick ass songs. So, let this be my shoutout to Janet, YOU ROCK :)  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Anyway, more painting follows tomorrow. Talk to you guys soon.
