EVER.... i shouldn't worry about missed oppurtunities....there won't be any... so no worrying ... no depression.... that would be nice..... but no.... i am definitely still heterosexual..... so i am definitely still attracted to women.... and i don't see that ever ending... i guess i will just feel depressed all of my live long life.... hmmm..... i think i need to find something fun to do... oh wait... i live in hudson... something else that is depressing in itself... hudson=fun... oh wait... JUST KIDDING... living in hudson is like ... how to describe hell... well there is absolutely nothing to do and i don't drive ... so even if there was something to do ... i couldn't get there... and i won't be getting my license for a while because A. i have to renew my temps... and B. i have to go to clay's 8th grade graduation tomorrow (don't get me wrong ... its cool and all ... but i miss driver's ed once again... which goes on a 3-4 week rotation... so i won't be done... til mid july if all goes well.... which it probably won't)   anyways... what else... while i'm on this long depressing blah blah blah.... hmm... well it doesn't feel like summer yet.. cool huh.. i get out of school to go work at this hell i like to call theater camp and enjoy the great rainy cold cloudy windy weather... my kind of summer..... saweet... i love my life... if only pete and pete or south park was on right now... it may be able to cheer me up a bit... but no.... not even my favorite television programming is here to help me out right now.... in this time of sadness... i think i shall go on prozac... at least  i would be wired and happy... not so fucking depressed all of the time.... but i guess i would have to see a doctor first.... and the odds of that happening are.... 0% sweet... depression it is... i will talk to all of you later... have a GREAT! day.... *hmpf*
