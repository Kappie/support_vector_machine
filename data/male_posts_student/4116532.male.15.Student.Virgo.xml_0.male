Yesterday we have spend all day long outside in a mall, which was pretty fun, I have played some Billiard, ate in a good resturant and had fun, which really helps me out. Tommorow I am coming back home, and I still have to finish my home asignment in math, which is due to the 25th...and I still have 40Â± problems to solve. Lets hope for better, and my sister should give birth to a baby boy (hopefuly before friday) so I could see him, ah, an uncle for two :).  I really feel like I have done the most of my holiday. See you all in two days time..or more :)
