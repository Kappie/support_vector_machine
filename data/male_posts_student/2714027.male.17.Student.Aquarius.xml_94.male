Guys in the first and second years perform the plays, while those in our year direct them. Someone gave me their ticket for free because they couldn't attend, so I went along with some friends and spend most of the evening watching them. Yesterday I was at work all day, where the weather seemed to switch between a hot summers' day and an autumnal rain storm. Hail and boiling sunshine in the same day - it could only be Britain.  Today I went out to town and bought a whole load of clothes to update my wardrobe, ready for summer. It was nice to have less people in town, with free parking and sales going on as well. I usually dislike highstreet-style shopping because it's not a relaxing environment, but today wasn't so bad. This afternoon I watched  The Thin Red Line , which was quite good, but not as good as say,  Saving Private Ryan  or  Band of Brothers .  This coming week should be a fairly easy one, with few lessons and work as usual, with the added bonus of my camera arriving and the party on Saturday night.
