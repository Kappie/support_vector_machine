If I could find a job that would let me work any hours I want I would be the most productive human being ever I think because at this time of night I just want to accomplish something.  Professional writer would work but for you kids who read my earlier poetry that probably isn't an option.  Ohh well.. I guess I will have to get with the real world at some point.  Ohh well...  I guess since there is no crystal ball to tell me the future I will have to rely on the old magic eight ball...  Well I asked the magic eight ball if I will ever fit in as a successful member of society and it comes back with...  (drum roll)  "It is decidedly so"  Ok so I guess I'm safe for now so I will let all you other sleepers get on with your life.  I'm out to try to sleep or at least maybe write some emails and watch Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure.  So  on that note I will leave you with a last that from Bill S. Preston Esquire, "Be excellent to each other."   NIght kids..  Maybe I will be back later for more late night madness...
