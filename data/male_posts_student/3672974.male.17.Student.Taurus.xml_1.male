I don't want to romanticize my past, because I know it isn't perfect, but remember when I was wilder and more willing to do crazy and disgusting things? I want to be like that. I don't know why I'm so restrained and inhibited. I guess I'm angry or jealous at anyone who steals the spotlight from me. Whenever someone does something noteworthy or something that gets them attention, I always think, "I can do that." But I don't think I want the spotlight as much as them. Whenever I get an award or something, I always downplay it. So I must be humble, right? I need to be less humble and more assertive. Humbleness and living according to moral ideals can't make one happy, because it's just impractical--even impossible.   I jumped on my bed today. I forgot how fun that was.
