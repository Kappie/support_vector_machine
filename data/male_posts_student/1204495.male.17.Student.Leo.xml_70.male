Your only saviour that solitary dove the one which symbolises your never ending love.  The day of pleasure is upon us, the only saviour i know now, is the one which lives high above us, the one that may not even be real, the one we can choose to belive in, the lord who has a never ending love for everyone, no matter what they have done in their lifetime, he has a never ending love for us. The day has begun, the gates swing open, but do i want them to be open, do i want to be here, or do i want to go back to my old life,the life where i seemed to be nobody, yet i had a vision, a vision whcih ultimately killed me, the vision of the world living in harmony, at peace with each other, no wars nothing, what will happen now?
