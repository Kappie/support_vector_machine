Went to the fair both days, saturday was more carnival and I saw some people I hadn't seen in a while and met some new people, saw Amy Szott, and Anna C, and talked to this guy Tom who I've seen around, it was all good. Also met up with Hannah, Helen, Alice, Charl, Kathleen, Wesley, Gareth, and then 2 of their friends James and Natalie.   Today was also pretty fun at the fair, saw a few people today; Rachel, Louise, Carly, Alex, Jen, Charm, Jax, Heather, Sam, Ollie and that was about it. Went on quite a few rides, like that nice big "King Loops" one which steals everyone's money when u go upside down, and the carousel which we weren't spun enough on. Then afterwards Jen, Charm and Louise came back to mine for some tea and a some  urlLink Alexio Project  (that link is a bit dodgy, so try refreshing, ctrl+f5-ing etc..)  Going back a bit to friday, I bought "Kyuss - Blues for the red sun" and we had coffee as usual, Dave bought two 99p videos. Brooke joined us for coffee with his gf Nush. Also Rachel couldn't make it (she abandonded us for Ollie Hutchings! =O how can he be better than me, Dave, Brooke, Louise and Helen? *gasp* =P) Brooke is now gunna join us more for coffee and we also did a bit of trying to embarress him infront of Nush, heh.  Well, more exams this week, Economics tomorrow, it's a 2 and a half hour long exam, eeek! Essay style writing and stuff, apparently that's not enought time according to my teacher, bah, I think I'm about as ready as I'll ever be.
