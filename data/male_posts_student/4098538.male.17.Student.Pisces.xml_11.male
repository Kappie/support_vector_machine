I actually think this gig topped Chimaira, and I didn't think that would ever be possible. But it did. They made an excellent entrance to what I'd expect of a band like Cradle of Filth to make. Breed 77 and SikTh played too. Breed 77 were phenomenal... they are a really good band! SikTh were really fucking weird... didn't like them too much to be honest. Machine Head blew them both away. I waited until 2am to meet them... I was so fucking tired. But meeting Robb Flynn was something I won't forget. He was so friendly and just an all round safe guy. Something really gay happened to me at the train station... as I was getting on the train Chris stood on my heel and my shoe fucking flew off and went in between the gap and under the train! Anyway, I'm tired and hungry. I'm gonna go see what food I have lying around this shit-hole, then get me some well-earned ZZZ's.
