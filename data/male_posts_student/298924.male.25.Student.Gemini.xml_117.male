Firstly....today I have been listening to Musiq (Mary Go Round, Halfcrazy, and Girl Next Door), Fiona Apple (about 20 songs) and Free Bird by Lynrard Skynard....no particular reason for mentioning that.....  Took my mom's, my sisters, my cousin Bryan's son Malik, and his mother Melanie to breakfast today for Mother's Day....it was really cool....moms and them were here for TSU's graduation.....my cousin  urlLink Radiance  graduated on Saturday....it was a nice ceremony....reminded me of last May 20th when I finished Morehouse....ahhhhh....  Hopefully I will be back in the ATL in time to catch a few senior week parties....my first graduation as an Alum should be really cool!  I had more stuff I wanted to say but I feel a touch of the cold my mom had getting passed to me so I am about to make some tea....I refuse to let a cold get me!!!  I know I usually write tributes and what not on special days but I wrote my mom a nice e-mail awhile back and I don't think she comes here (I kinda hope she doesn't) so I don't wanna waste words....I love her...she loves me....you only get one mom and my mom is the best....she raised a good young man if I may be so bold to say so....
