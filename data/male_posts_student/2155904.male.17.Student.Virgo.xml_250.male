He thought he had to get up then and clean the downstairs but it turned out the people weren't coming over until 11:30 for brunch so Tyke could have slept another hour. Instead he just cleaned for a while and then when he was done he watched tv while he wished he was sleeping. Later he took a shower and waited til the people came over. One of the ladies was a really smiley lady. She would just look at Tyke and smile for like 5 seconds. It was quite awkward. Tyke didn't know what to do cuz it wasn't like they were talking or anything. They just happened to be standing near each other. The people stayed for about 3 hours or maybe more or maybe less. After they left Tyke talked with his parents about which laptop he's getting but they still wouldn't help him make his final decision. He is pretty sure he knows what he wants but they keep not being as definitive as him. Basically he needs to push them to just order it. Later on Tyke watched Rat Race on TV and then got called by Kinker to play poker at Bondage's house with MSwa and Jew. Bondage's friend came and he hadn't played poker before so he wasan easy 10 bucks. Tyke ended up winning 25 from the pot and now is up 50 this week. Not bad for 4 games. It was quite a hilarious game too. A good crew of guys for this game. And they were all, except for Bondage, good at poker so it was even better that way. It's more fun taking money from somebody who's good than somebody like Amed. Haha, just kidding. Tyke also got called by Naan while he was playing poker and they are gonna get together on Tuesday. And on Monday Tyke and Purdy are going to the Mariners game and hanging out. Tyke is also supposed to get a call from Tina about when they are going to hang out this week so Tyke is already getting his schedule all filled up. It's quite nice in fact.
