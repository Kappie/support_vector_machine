I didn't hear it at first, but later another manager replied with, "He was shot and killed in 1964, and then Lyndon B. Johnson took over the presidency." So there I am, wondering if I should point out the huge flaw in my manager's comment...well I did, so I replied with, "I'm nearly positive that JFK was killed on November 22, 1963." There I am, even giving them the day, heck I could've given them the city, time...blah blah blah. Well the [incorrect] manager replied, "Well, I just talked to my mother, who majored in history in college, so I thinks she's right." Hah, whatever, your mother is a fool is more like it. Then some random employee replied, "Oooh, you calling his mom a liar?" Anyways, I just remembered all of this, went to wikipedia.com and found out that JFK was indeed killed November 22, 1963, I printed the page out and wrote in black sharpie on the bottom, "Yes, your mother's a liar."  I'll leave it unsigned. :D
