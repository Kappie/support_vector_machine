Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Goodies -Ciara feat. Petey Pablo  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #15   Britney Spears , from her 2001 hit “I’m a  Slave 4 U”: “All you people look at me like I'm a little girl.”  Ciara , from her current “Goodies”: “You may look at me and think that I'm just a young girl.” Okay, we get it. Ciara is the newest  Lolita , once a virgin temptation now looking to break her seal as a sex-savvy fox. But wait; with continual listening, we start to hear some surprising lyrics. Backed by funk guitars taken from  Lloyd Banks’  “On Fire” (a song about being hot), high-pitched techno squeals stolen from  Missy Elliott’s  “Work It” (a song about sex), and echoed synth chords copped from guest-verbalist  Petey Pablo’s   “Freek-A-Leek” (a song about hot sex),  Ciara  croons this line: “[If you’re] lookin’ for the goodies, keep on lookin' cause they stay in the jar.”  What?  Everything about this  Lil’ Jon  production pushes secretive, sweaty love-making, all down to  Ciara’s  bedside whimpers during the chorus. But, like  Mis-Teeq’s  “Scandalous” (“A one night stand just ain’t enough”), this is a summer club jam against fast lifestyles. Being a prude never sounded so sleazy, and that illustrates the unfortunate downfall of this track:  Ciara  can’t sound this seductive when singing that “[she's] not goin’ home with you.”   The Verdict:  4.0/10 - Brouhaha   (2.0/5)
