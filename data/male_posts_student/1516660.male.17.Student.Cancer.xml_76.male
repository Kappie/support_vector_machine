She didn't say anything bad about me to my mother. She even said I was "likable". I am so happy!  -->In today's "lucky draw", I was unfortunately chosen (I wished I could be this lucky when it comes to the Harry Potter contest), but what made me happy was: She gave me a look of sympathy, which she didn't to the other winners. Felt so sympathised and happy. YaY!  -->She is always nice towards me....kinda in a biased way. Enjoyed that la...HeHeHe  She is a very nice Chemistry teacher. She motivated me to study well in Chemistry...and I did and I got excellent results to prove it. She inspired me to become a Chemistry teacher. I want to return to Riverside as a Chem teacher and be her collegue. So fun. I have dep admiration for Mrs Chew. Maybe I should tell her that. During graduation la.  Thank you, Mrs Chew.
