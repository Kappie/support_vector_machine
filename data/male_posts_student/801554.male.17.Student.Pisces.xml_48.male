We have to write at least two of the poems, and the rest have to be published works. Hopefully I'll be able to choose; there is so much to choose from.  I'm listening to an interesting artist by the name of Tina Malia, an album called Shores of Avalon, and I recommend you get a copy. It's very good music. It's classified into "new age" but don't trust those classifiers. What do they know?
