As Belky, Lynn, Renae, Victor and I were driven downtown by Renae's brother, much worry was bestowed upon myself as well as others as Renae was visually ailing.  Arriving after an unenventful journey, the father of time itself could give no guess as how we would fare.   Although, that was not how the day was started.  For in the morning, the schooling with which we were to part take in was all worthy enough to have a post of its own in this humble book of lives and life.  When arriving at O'Conner, time was painstakingly consumed as those longing for lessons only arrived at a storage room.  Our information being more than a little distorted, Veronica and I failed to locate the room we were to train our Japanese language.  Though, after extensive search, we arrived at the proper area, just in time to start our hour-long wait for a teacher.  After recieving notice of our teacher's absence, the class in its entirity migrated accross the hall to the Eleventh/Twelfth grade class.  The teacher, a wonderfully funny Filipino man reverted to a review stage and many of us learned the uses of Particles and counting systems.  I created about half a page of notes that is currently in the possession of Veronica.  After missing the break, we were let out about 60 seconds before the anouncment that instructed teachers not to dismiss their pupils until the bell.  The very, very loud bell that met us while we greeted Renae.   After hasty goodbyes and a few phone calls, we (Renae and I) were on our way to her house to wait for the others.  Thus you find us where I left off, arriving downtown at the Convention Center Building North.  On our way to the South building, we bumped into Anne-Margareth and Donald's group.  (Please, excuse spelling).   Most of the people reading this should know what happened next.  There was an argument.  The details of which don't have to be displayed, but the 5 minute argument ended with me walking off and sitting at a bench for over an hour.     After returning, I was found by a teary Renae and an also worried Victor.  After meeting with an angry Belky and a stalling-Renae's-mom-on-the-phone Lynn, I took Renae to talk over alone.  Most likely another hour passed before Renae and I returned.  During which I learned of how sick tired Renae ran around the convention center looking for me.  I learned how she almost fainted from fatigue.  I learned how much pain, suffering and humiliation she went through.   All I can say about this experience is, I'm sorry to everybody that's involved for what I did.  And I'm sorry to Renae.  I love you, and I make a promise on this day, and on this page to prove it to you in all my actions, and do the opposite of what happened on that day.  I will always try my hardest to only give you what you deserve, the best, and always only the best.  I'm sorry to those involved, and thank you to everyone for taking your time reading this.  -ArV
