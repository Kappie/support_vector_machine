I don't entirely want to have it up but somehow I'm feeling it necessary to tell people like Sam who are always offline when I'm on what's going on. Not that they particularly care, but it's nice for people to be informed, isn't it? I know I like being informed. "A teenage bride with a baby inside, getting high off information."  As RHCP fans will recognise, I'm quite far in my attempt to learn all of the words for Californication. I need the last segment and then I'm done. Hurrah! Then the afore-named Tubular Luggage can play it and have a singer who is capable, because he knows the words! Hussah thrice times! Hussah once more!  I got my GCSE RE result today... I got an A (whoopee!!!!) and so generally I'm a little bit "whoo" today. Well, I would be but I have some really bitter feeling that have come up so I'm trying to get them back down again. It's useful to have someone cheery to help you if you're down. I want to be that person again. Not the person I am now.  Anyway, yeah, generally spent today with Stanners discussing my experiences in Sam's computer room... sorry Sam! Stanners just said he kept thinking about your breasts and so we got talking... about your breasts... well... sorry! *hides*  ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE amount of hugs to Zoe and Lisa for their GCSE results! They are... very, VERY clever and should be showered wi......th Vodka! You know, those kinds of parties tend to have large amounts of alkyhole! Whoopee!  And no, I'm not high. I did have an energy tab though.... many dextrose. Maybe I'm a bit high then... ah well. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!  All you need is love, Jon Roskilly
