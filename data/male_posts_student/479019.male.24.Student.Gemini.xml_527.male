She flat out said she's hesitant from letting Tania and I swap, because she doesn't trust me working with George. That's a load of crap. She should fucking know that I'm a pretty good worker and that's just lame thinking that I can't work with a friend. I think she said that because of the personal history between the three of us, but then again that makes her a hypocrite. It makes her a hypocrite since she used to work with us as schedulers and we were all friends. We had fun and got our work done. It's also stupid because I get along with everyone in the office. I get along with everyone except her. It's not my fault everyone likes me and no one likes her.  Alas Crystal had to work today. Alas Evan made plans. Maybe I'll try calling up another friend. I wanna make use of being able to sleep in. Maybe I'll call up Naomi.  ***
