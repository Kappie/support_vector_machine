Boring start and nobody was free to do anything and Macaroon wasn't being a good sport about Tyke's great ideas for what to do.  So Tyke just stayed home.  Then at like 4:30 Skippy was free so Tyke tried to call Macaroon but his line was busy for at least a half hour.  So finally he got a hold of him and he was about to sit down to dinner in like an hour.  They still met over there and played a few games of Halo.  Then Tyke and Skippy went to Mongolian Grill for dinner.  It was a very quality meal.  Then Tyke called back Macaroon but Amed and other guys were all unavailable.  So it ended up being Tyke, Skippy, and Macaroon for the night.  Tyke called up Purdy and she called back later and they have set preliminary plans to have a fun night of DDR and such at Tyke's house Monday night.  Not to mention the showing of the TWO music videos and other shots of footage from oddball things.  Yes, thats right folks.  TWO VIDEOS!!!  Well the three studs made another music video.  This one was to Amazed by Lonestar.  This one was done with more thinking and planning though so it turned out well.  To just put it simply, it involves Tyke and Tina.  That is all that can be said for now.  You would have to see it to believe it.  But the makers consider it quality work.  Just watch it to find out.  So after that they didn't have much to do really.  They played some Halo and stuff but it really wasn't awesome.  Then Macaroon left and it was just Tyke and Skippy.  They just filmed themselves talking and it was pretty gay but whatever.  At least it, actually no it was gay.  Whatever...time to try and SLEPP!  Tyke loves slepping.  He could slep all the time if it were possible.  Slep, slep, slep, all day long.
