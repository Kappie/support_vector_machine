They are each maestros on their instruments, yet they blend with amazing precision to create a sonic experience like no other.   A CAVEAT:  You must understand bands like Rush, Yes, Queen, Kansas, etc.  to appreciate their style.   They also include Elton John, Journey, and Metallica as their influences!   Oh, and please ignore the scathing Amazonian reviews from the dopes who're into stuff like Opeth, Pantera, and DMX  (duh...).
