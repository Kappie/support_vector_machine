When I showed up, no one was there, and the girl who lives there wasn't answering her cell phone.  Rather than wait around for hours for someone to show up, I went to  urlLink school .  From noon to 2 PM there was a  urlLink workshop  for the  urlLink Preliminary Exam .  I got there quite a bit before noon, though, so first I went up to 1015 Evans to take some pictures.       urlLink Looking towards the Bay.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)       urlLink Looking farther to the north.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)       urlLink Sather Tower.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)       urlLink Looking south from the room where the workshop was held.    urlLink (2)    urlLink (3)     The pictures aren't that spectacular because it was a cloudy day.  Maybe next time I head up there it'll be clearer.  I showed up for the workshop about 10 minutes early, because of this thing called Berkeley time.  If someone at UC Berkeley says class starts at noon, that means it really starts at 12:10 PM.  I'd heard about this before, but I thought it was some sort of joke about Berkeley people being late all the time.  I guess not.  The  urlLink girl  teaching the algebra part of the workshop has a web page dedicated to  urlLink her car .
