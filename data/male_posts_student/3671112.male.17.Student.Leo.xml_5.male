(or something like that). *alt+left,left,left*. bummer. i can see how they might require you to be at a legal working age for your state.. but they strictly forbid porn and things like that, so i'm not sure where the 18 comes from. i'm employable. i'm taxable. believe me, i'm very taxable.  but in other good news, i passed out on my bed around 6pm last night and woke up about 30 minutes ago. feeling pretty good right now. a little sore, but still, it feels good to be up this early, and not because i stayed up all night.  but anyway, i just lost like 20% of the respect i had for google (so i'm now at 80%), so fuck that anyway. i have something else lined up for advertising. something that will pay me by time, not by clicks. so take that google! jk ilu 3 ;(
