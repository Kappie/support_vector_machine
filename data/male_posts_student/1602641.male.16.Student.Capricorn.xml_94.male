Trying to remove the F-word from  Reservoir Dogs  is analagous to trying to remove Christ from the Bible. The dialogue, once snappy and clever, was made awkward and jerky by the F-word’s absence. Some of the most powerful lines in the movie were reduced to dismal puddles of mediocrity - ( Note: all words in bold type are used by the network to replace the F-word, and asterisks indicate where the F-word was deleted altogether and not replaced with anything)  - for example, Mr.Pink (Steve Buscemi), after being pushed to the ground and repeatedly kicked by Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), pulls out his pistol and yells “You wanna  screw  with me? I’ll show ya who you’re  screwin’  with!” OH PLEASE spare me. And then of course there was the ever-so-memorable part when Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), lying in a pool of his own blood, screams at the whining cop (who admittedly had ample reason to whine, having just had his ear sliced off) “ Poor  you!  Poor  you! I’m * dyin’ here! I’m * dyin’!” How utterly appalling. Curiously enough, though, Bravo didn’t feel it necessary to delete any other naughty words, including “shit” and “asshole”. This strikes me as being extraordinarily stupid. Listen:  Reservoir Dogs  is an incredible movie. If anyone reading this hasn’t seen it, go rent it. Now. Don’t bother with the pitiable rubbish version that the TV networks serve up.   On a related note, Dick Cheney recently told Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) to go f*** himself - on the floor of the United States Senate. What’s more, he refused to apologize for it, and Bush campaign officials ACTUALLY DEFENDED HIM. This from the same gaggle of puritanical jerkwads who vociferously condemned John Kerry for using the F-word in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. Hey, Bushies! There is a world of difference between Rolling Stone and the U.S. Senate! Why can’t you mean little imps understand this??? It’s not the word that offends me, it’s the overwhelming hypocrisy. Is an ‘I’m sorry for my poor choice of words’ so very hard to manage? I mean, really! Have some actual decency for once!
