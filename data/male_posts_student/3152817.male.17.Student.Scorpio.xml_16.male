Marijuana, like any intoxicating drug, including alcohol, should never be used when it could potentially cause harm to others.  The greatest danger that would, and does, face the public from pot heads and drunks, is when these people sit behind the wheel.  For a more personal story on how intoxicated drivers are dangerous in the driver's seat, ask a friend of mine (most of you already know who this is) who was hit by a drunk driver coming home from work this summer.       There is simply no excuse for driving while intoxicated.  Anyone caught driving under the influence of any drug, including alcohol, should loose there driving license for ten years and sit in jail for one of those years, all for his or her first offence.  If an innocent person dies as a result of another drivers blatant disregard for the law, I say hang ‘em at sundown.  (More about public hangings for criminals in a later post)    A lot of you are going to say this draconian resembling punishment is simply too harsh for America.  I don’t think so at all.  Tougher penalties for crimes would solve a lot of problems in our country.  Deaths caused by intoxicated drivers are as preventable as the spread of AIDS.  There is purely no reason for drunks and stoners to be behind the wheel.    With great freedom comes equally great responsibility, keep that in mind.
