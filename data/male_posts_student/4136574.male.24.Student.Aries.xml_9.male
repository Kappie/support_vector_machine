If I could always be happy even when horrid things happen to me I would take it more as a sign of maturity or luck than bad form (unlike most people).  Still, with so much pain the last couple days, and it being so soon... I just wonder what happened.  Lack of sleep, or I'm just pretending it didn't happen?  I don't know.  Elissa is still a ghost.  Always online, not energetic, barely able to detach herself from the internet.  I wish she were happier or more outgoing, even if not towards me.  Maybe it was the fear of losing the friends and lifestyle that hurt more than the relationship.  Sounds bad to say, but it may have been true.  And getting to hang out with Kelly and see Elissa able to be around me (as well as she can be around anyone not online) was heartening I guess.  I hope my days continue in this way.  I would like to make the most of my weeks before school begins.
