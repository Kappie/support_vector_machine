The elderly members of the audience either didn't hear or understand the jokes, and the primary school children left halfway between Act Two. More than a slight debacle, but we kept going through it all and survived. My microphone was falling off my head consistently through most of the songs I sing, especially giving me trouble through the choreography. It's bad enough to wear Madonna-style microphone headsets, but if they don't perform their intended function, it goes beyond a joke.  Tonight all was amended. The microphone no longer sucked because the tech crew worked out how they are meant to sit on your head. After I got over the embarassment of finding I was wearing the thing in entirely the wrong fashion, I was intensely relieved that I could relax on stage without fear the microphone was about to eat my face or fall on the floor. The crowd was pumped, laughed at all the right places and enjoyed the bits I love performing. I'm truly having an awesome time.  The surreal nature of time's behaviour when one is on stage goes beyond explanation. Time simply races, and the whole experience is entirely out-of-body goodness. I will miss  Hot Mikado  by the time Friday night comes, but having my life back is something I will not take for granted!   Homework I have not done because of  Hot Mikado  and blog:    Preparation for English Creative Response SAC on  The Quiet American   Maths sheet  Public speaking preparation (more on this later)   Well, that's it for now. The mundane rubbish about homework was posted because only I read the blog at this stage.   If you come back and read this, if the foolish idea of advertising my nonsensical ramble to the world occurs, do not blame me, for you were not meant to read this. It is your own fault and I shall hear no complaints.  Hail Mary full of grace, help me find a parking space. I'm not Catholic.
