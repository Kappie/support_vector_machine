The start of B corps is coming up soon, I can't wait to see the gang again. We've all been going through drum corps withdrawals, and I think the short four hours will be just what we need. And it looks like bunches of new people will be there, I can't wait to see what the turnout will be like... 2004 is a big year for BDB!  Not much to say, but that Austin, Chels and I will be unified in our marching days, no matter what color uniform we're wearing, by corresponding our underwear =D I love you guys!  DCI party coming up soon, probably next weekend, IM me for info!
