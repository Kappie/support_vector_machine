Searching for a place to live right now and am having a heck of a hard time finding anything.  Most people are simply not responding to my emails and those that have either refuse to rent unless I can come see them in person (obviously impossible when I am in Victoria) or don’t speak English - though since I don’t speak French I can’t really complain that much.    To help out with the fact I can’t come meet people in person I have put together a little slideshow of myself at  urlLink Ofoto . After emailing some 14 people I have had two favourable responses.  One fellow who thinks I “sound cool” so wants me to give him a shout when I arrive in town, but doesn’t have a place for me to live and another guy that has a place a bit further from McGill than I would like though I am talking to him about taking the place since my options are a little limited (i.e. it may be this place or the cardboard box I am bring with me).  Still a little bit of searching time left so I am not panicking yet, but I am starting to feel I will have to take a place a little further away from McGill.  Guess there are 4 universities (McGill, Concordia, University of Montreal, and something else??) all located in the downtown area so the roommate market is a touch competitive.
