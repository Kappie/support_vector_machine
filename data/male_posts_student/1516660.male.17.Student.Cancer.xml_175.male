Feel so guilty...and tomorrow morning going out with family. HaHa!  Okay...today, me, Hann and Wendy are supposed to go Guan Ying Temple to pray for O Level Success lor. But first, let me narrate the day's happenings. Okay, I woke up at 9 (i was woken by by the sounds of the vacuum, but I fell asleep after that). Then, I took a bath and ate breakfast.  After that, I watched Friday's Holland V episode. HaHaHa!! The JingJing got a very accurate mouth "He (Ying TianCheng) will drown in sea!" !!! HaHaHA!! I wan to see how JingJing and the family will react when they heard the news man! I also ate my lunch (noodles).  Then, I studied the Physics chapter, then went online. At 12, I prepared myself to go outside lor. I went out of the house at 12.25.  I met Wendy at Admiralty MRT. We milled around Popular for a while, then hopped onto the train towards Sembawang. We waited for the late Yit Hann till 1.15 or so. Haiz. So late. We saw a lot of interesting couples riding up the escalators. People nowadays are getting more daring while riding escalators. I saw a woman rubbing her boyfriend's butt. She caught me looking and immediately stopped! HAHAHA! Then, I saw another couple. The male was biting (lovebites?) his girl's shoulders. People are really getting more daring. Wendy said I am very kaypoh. Ha!  Okay, after Hann arrived, we hopped into the south-bound train towards City Hall. I mainly read my book I brought along (Charlotte's Web). It's a very good book! I admire Charlotte's loyalty for a friend and her selflessness. Meow meow!! Wendy and Hann asked each other SS questions. They said hor, I am very abosrbed into my book. Yeah what. Reading should be absorbing ma. After reaching City Hall, we board the east-bound train towards Bugis, which is only a stop away.  At bugis, I showed them the "prostitute house" I saw last time. They even have sign saying "If you want 2 do that, please call 9------". See!! Prostitute house indeed! Okay...the main attraction was not the brothel. We went to GuanYin Temple. Okay, we took incense and prayed lor. We first prayed to the skies, then to the GuanYin in the temple, then put our incense. We then went in, prayed some more and donated money. I took sweets for us (blessef by the goddess). I prayed for blessigns and success at O Levels, and also peace for everybody. That's it, yeah. I felt happy. Meow meow!!  We went back at around 2.30. Hann slept on the journey back. I read my book and Wendy studied SS. We and Wendy alighted at Admiratly and shopped around Popular! Woah lao! I am so heartbroken! I don't have enough money to buy the latest Charmed book!!!! Wendy refused to lend me money! You say how! I say hor, by tomorrow, the books will be sold out. Only 2 of them you know!!! I am so heartbroken!  Okay....reached home at 4. I bathed and then studied Maths lor. After studying, I rewarded myself with playing a GunBound game. Meow meow! I went to eat dinner at 6, reaching home at 6.45 to watch Holland V. Father brought durians! Yum!!!  Today's Holland V episode was nice! Family reunion! So heartwarming. YanYan finally forgave her family! That's so cool! After that, I watch Comedy Nite and came online.  I giotta go le. I wanna watch 'Are You Hot'. Ooh boy! I love seeing contestants getting critisized. Meow meow! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
