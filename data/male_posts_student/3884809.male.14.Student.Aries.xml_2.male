My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst to break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  The words are hushed, let's not get busted, Just lay entwined here undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions.. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear, so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me So won't you kill me, so I die happy My heart is yours, to fill or burst To break or bury, or wear as jewelry Whichever you prefer  Hands down, this is the best day I can ever remember I'll always remember the sound of the stereo,  The dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair That you twirled in your fingers And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late And this walk that we shared together The streets were wet and the gate was locked So I jumped it, and let you in And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist And you kissed me like you meant it And I knew that you meant it That you meant it, that you meant it And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it.   ~"Hands Down" by Dashboard Confessional
