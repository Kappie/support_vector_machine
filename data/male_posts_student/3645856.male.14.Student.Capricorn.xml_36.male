I got there a few minutes into it (5 minutes) but the story didn't get good till I had seated. I used one of the gift certificates that I had received from school for getting a six hundred on my SOL (joy...), anywho, I felt really connected to the movie. Mostly because I've seen it happen before. It's so sad... My mom is a nurse and I've volunteered at the nursing home and rehabilitation center she works it. It really takes a certain kind of person to do such a job... working with the elderly. Boy, do I have stories to tell about that place. You probably don't know what I'm talking about if you haven't seen the movie. It just made me so damn sad yet happy at the same time. It's well worth it to go see it. I mean... this movie was just so beautiful... it's sad, but it's beautiful. It's sad because I've had people in their 80s tell me their stories about things like that movie. Things that happened back then. I've seen them come and go. I've seen them pass on. A lot of nurses never seem to care...   Oh, and Shelly just refreshed my memory on accident. This movie majorly took place in Charleston, South Carolina. I recognized a lot of the area and recognized  urlLink http://www.boonehallplantation.com  That's a plantation I visited on my stay down there. Beautiful place. The sad thing in my mind were the slave cabins... 7 or 8 remaining brick slave cabins, if I recall. They're the only things left standing that are original. I saw that and those great big willow trees lining the drive to the front gate. I felt like I needed to shout "That's Boone Hall"!!! The house was rebuilt in 1935 as a colonial revival plantation... anywho, enough of history. I get too deep into details.  Now, I'm going to remember all of the people passed through my life... people who died of ages between 86 and 104... if I recall.  Mrs. Kemp + Mr. Kemp (how I loved this couple... I loved them so much.. his wife passed shortly him though... )  Mrs. Carter (I always remember you.. alzheimers had taken you, but I still did my best to converse when I could)  Mrs. Allaun (I remember sitting in your room and watching TV... I remember you falling asleep the night you had died... I remember your chair... that was my last memory... sitting in your recliner the night you died and my mom discovered and called me in the morning around 7 after my dad picked me up)  Mrs. Nicholas (I know you couldn't speak well... but I remember your stories about when you were a doctor and about your husband)  Mrs. Fletcher (Those last days were bad memories... you were the first resident I really got to know... I must have been six or seven then...)  Mrs. Brown (I remember you telling me about where you lived... not more than a half a mile from where I lived... I remember looking for your glasses... even though you were blind.)  These are a few people who I still remember today. A few people who left a memory in my life. They are a few people who I will never forget... I did all I could. Hoped I could make a difference. Rest in peace.   ~ George Snow
