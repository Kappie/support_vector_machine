Poem Beginning with a Line from Frost    as if regret were in it and were sacred      as if regret itself were a river and want  which was the source of that river flowed      through the river, more and more the more  the river thickened towards the boring lake      where what stirred once went terribly quiet.  This is indistinguishable from happiness.      This standing water was a mindful current once.  Once was a mindful current: now leaden, still:      it is ourselves we most resemble now; now  the maples that had been nowhere gather. When      we look down we look down on our own.
