Why am i not sleeping? well i'd tell you why. i came back home bout 11pm. had a shower and did a few of my daily stuff like read the papers and shit like that. then i went on to watch bowling for columbine again and laid down on my bed facing my com screen. it was a dvd so i skippped scenes and went on to the 2nd half of the show. i dozed off as i intended to and i had this dream of ryan singing this song which has the word "bowling" in it. It got very irritating cos he kept repeating the line over and over again. he suddenly chased me and his pants fell, and i woke up. I then realised that the song ryan was singing could be heard out of my com speakers, (cos when u know a dvd ends, it always appears at the main screen, usuallly with a 5s song accompanying it, which keeps on repeating). Ah shit, then i looked at the clock, and say the long hand strike the number 10, sheesh, i was late! i rushed over to take a quick shower, putting my uniform and that was when i took a look at the clock again, it was just 12.55pm. uber pissed. and stupid. oh wait, thats not all, so i thought, ah screw it, might as well eat lunch, when i was taking my plate servings, i spilled noodle and just when i finished cleaning the mess up, my fork fell, hit the edge of the table, did a triple somesault in the air before landing straight down onto my toe. Yes, i accidentally pierced my toe with a fork. there was blood too. while walking to my room i fucked up my ankle and it hurts when i walk now. ah shit, hahaha what a day, hahahaha. I'm an idiot.
