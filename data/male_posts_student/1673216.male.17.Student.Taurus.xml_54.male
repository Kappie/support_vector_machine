So lately I've been pretty zoned out. My mind is basically always thinking about one thing or the other, but never the right one. I wish I could focus, channel SOMETHING. But nope. That would be too good :D.   So I talked to my friend John about a problem of the world. What do you do with those total jackasses with no respect for people, so shallow their actions can be, and you can only shake your head and wonder why. He concluded, and I had to agree, that the only thing that could be done is to just treat them with respect. Now you may ask yourself, "Why do these people deserve my respect?" Well frankly, they don't. But the thing is, everyone has done bad things in their life, and yet they still can be mean to others that are merely doing what they are doing. If you disrespect them, you are merely perpetuating the hatrid. But that's not what we want. We want it to end. So you can't insult them, because they'll insult you, and a vicious cycle will come. You can only hope that some of them will look back and say "Wow, look what I have been doing." Now not all of them will do this, but you can only hope for those who do. You can't be mean just to make the cycle continue. That brings you to where they are..They only way to end it is to be that light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel figure. Not ideal, but better then some options.       I aint workin for your father, but I might as well be, I aint lookin' for confusion, but it tends to follow me.
