I realize that there are three things in my life that whenever at least one of them is around, I am truly happy.  Number One - God.  And when I say God, I mean Him and the church and everyone I've met through there, everyone tries to help build each and every person up and help them to realize the greatness that, with your help, they can do.  Number Two - my best friend, Stephanie.  She is the most amazing person I've ever met. She is funny, warm, intellegent, kind, and has one of the biggest hearts one person would ever hope to have.  Number Three - the theatre. I always feel at home in a theatre.  Thank you theatre.  For giving me a creative outlet and letting me get paid for something I actually enjoy!  Thanks for shoving me down into the deepest dark pit of my soul so I realized I couldn't live without God.  And thanks for introducing me to the greatest friend I've ever known.  Thank you Stephanie.  For all your encouragement - in our friendship; in my faith and journey; and in that crazy theatre world.  Thank You God for those three things.  It's thanks to You that I'm alive.  Thank You that through You my friendship with Stephanie grows stronger everyday, and thank You for my creative gifts and for allowing me the ability to share them with You and the world.   [ Disclaimer  -  this is the second time I've written this out.  The first time - blogger messed up on me and it didn't post and I lost the whole thing.  Sorry if this doesn't sound very eloquent or flow very well, I tried to reconstruct it the best I could.  All the sentiments are there, I just hope all the heart is still there, too. ]
