Haha I don't know what happend with all my friends:S...It's kinda a bummer letting go of alot of them. But they don't seem to miss me or nothing.  I've been trying to be more real with myself:)...and it turns out that if I'm real with myself I'm not all that great of a person haha  actually crappy is a better term...It's almost like I saw myself like alot without God and I realized like man the real me without God is terrible and I gotta have him fully in my life.  :S I'm talked soo much bout living this totally for God but man it's been tough:S.  I'm doing fine...Like I'm not off the target...I know what's the truth and now I'm heading towards it with more intensity then I have been.  I get caught up alot of the time with Self- rightousness and Spiritual Pride and that's cuz I am striving for God:S...Idn Mr.Kennedy talked about how striving for God isn't what we should be doin it's more like we gotta live by the spirit and like that's how in turn we'll get close to God.  It's not like u keep up living a moral life and u get close to God.  That's what we all buy into.  we all end up trying to "live for Christ" yet we just basically limit oursleves to some dumb rules and crap and we don't go anywhere:S.  Man we gotta live this for Christ but the way we do it is living by Faith and living by the Spirit.  God rocks...but don't limit yourself:)...U'll always fall short with Stupid rules.  Just live by the spirit and let the holy spirit decide choices for u.  Thinking bout it that way I think it's rad cuz it's almost like God is making decisions for u:D haha that's awesome.  Haha he could make u something way better than u make yourself.  Give ur all to him.  Don't be afraid:)...that's what Satan wants.  Don't give in to the thought that God doesn't have ur best intentions in mind.  God bless u:)and if could comment that'd be great...And if u comment I'd like it alot if u put your name to it:)
