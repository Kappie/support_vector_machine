Here's an outline of my day..  around 8:00am - I woke up.. My mom told me to study but I'm not in the mood.. So I opened the tv and watched cartoons, MYX etc.. (You can't blame me.. It's more fun to watch cartoons than to study Genetics)  around 9:00am - I opened the fridge.. I found no leftovers from yesterday so I ate a bowl of milk and cereals instead.. While watching tv of course (MMmm... I haven't eaten a bowl of cereals in days)  around 10:00am - I opened the computer.. I wanted to post a new entry but I have nothing.. (For those who are online, I'm in invisible mode)  around 12:00noon - It's lunch-time and I'm starving... I usually eat heavy breakfasts, in this case, I just ate cereals.. so I ate, ate and ate.. (Burp... Excuse me..)  around 1:00pm - I tried to study.. For 5 minutes, I find the atmosphere too quiet so I played my favorite songs.. Guess what, I just sang with the player and didn't study.. (Again, You can't blame me.. The song "She Will Be Loved" is really catchy..)  around 1:30pm - I'm getting tired of singing, I opened the tv again.. I lied on my bed and watched National Geographic. (just a trivia: The animal with the most number of teeth are the dolphins)  around 2:00pm - My eyelids are getting heavier.. Have I told you that I have the tendency to be sleepy with a full stomach... (ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)  around 5:00pm - I woke up.. I decided to check my brother.. My mom told me to help him review.. But he's already finished reviewing..  (I'm the best tutor in the world!!)  around 7:00pm - My mom got home.. I pretend teaching my brother.. Hehe (can't wait for the "payday")  around 8:00pm - It's dinner-time!! My second favorite time of the day.. Mmmmm.. (My mom sure can cook!!!) (Lunch-time is first..)  around 9:00pm - I was composing the same entry.. but I accidentally pressed back.. so, I have to start over.. Laugh all you want!!! (translation: ughhh!!)  now - I'm getting sleepy again..  Well, early to bed, early to rise.. I need lots of time to study tomorrow!!  VELASCO, OUT!!!
