Harvard meets its obligation by presenting us with a variety of theories of success (some of which you might find revolting). I'm not sure about this one.  I'd like to think Harvard, and all educational institutions, have something of a duty to better society, and I'm not sure it betters society to advise people to be jerks in order to get ahead in their careers.  I don't know. And I'm not sure a couple of classes on being true to yourself, whatever that means, would be such a bad idea.
