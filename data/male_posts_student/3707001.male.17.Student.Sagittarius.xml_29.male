Then again I got paid yesterday. I finally broke the $300 mark!! ^_^ hehe... now I gotta give $250 to my parents...  I went to TD instead youth wednesday to get my student line of credit. Got approved. Now I just gotta go and sign it and get em to pay my tuition and I'm good for the year. Hopefully my work doesn't close down cuz I need to still pay for monthly interest.  I also have a big mouth...  My dilemna: should I play SC or Star Wars: KOTOR?  That's about all my life has to offer, here's a song that has ALOT of meaning :P  Jesus Walks (remix) - Kanye West and Mase   (Verse One - Kanye West)   Between the girls in the jury   The devil tryin’ lure me, fury me   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me   My Pastors shakin’ his head, He ain’t sure of me, but surely   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me,   They asked, do you say your prayersAt least two a week?   I ain’t talking to god,I know what I’ve been doin’ G   Do you know how I be embarrassed?   My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents    And I ain’t good, at that "give us this day"   The slaves is trying to give us this free,   I’m trying to give us this pay   Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was   We was all ‘ghetto fabulous’ All at the rooms in the Cyberus   From this Jacuzzi water, Can you cleanse us?   Can you please unfold my Cardiare Lenses?    God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses   For me I almost died, Falling asleep in the Benz   It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized   And when I play it at my show I feel sanctified    And he gives me direction when I can’t decide   He is alive   How can you tell me that he ain’t, When I said,       -Jesus Walks-(Kanye) God show me the way, now the devil can’t break me down   -Jesus walks with me- (Kanye) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now   -I want Jesus-(Kanye) And now I think there is something that I can say now that’ll right my wrongs   -Jesus walks with me-(Kanye) I finally talked to God, I ain’t afraid ‘cuz his love is so strong      (Verse 2 - Mase)   Come on, Come on, Before you take my name   Take my fame   Why you had to take my shame?   Take my flaws   Take my blame   Feel my dirt, Conceal my hurt   See my bruise   Do this and you will walk in my shoes   You wasn’t there when I was in deep thought   When I had two choices,   Kill him, or either leave New York   But I’m a true teller (yeah,)   That’s why I say what I’m saying (yeah)   And the only thing the radio is playing Is because you be payin   It ain’t about who really hot no more   Beasts will knock no more   So who cares? Who flock no more?   I realize that most labels pay you for lies   And only law dudes can disguise   That’s your favorite artist (shhh)   I know you hear that (huh?)   You wanna fear that? (what?)   Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that   I and Kan’ to rap this like John the Baptist   Prepared the way,   For what I came to say today   They deceived us,   Having thinking Jesus   Really didn’t need us   When he loved up all you   He loved the boys in the hard days up in broad day   Even those who be here for dope, every four days   To the strippers in broad day up in Norway   To the Detroit player gators up in more ways   With me, its not just bars and music   I walk with god   I got the scar to prove it      -Jesus Walks-(Kanye) God show me the way, now the devil can’t break me down   -Jesus walks with me- (Kanye) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now      (Outro - Mase)    Everybody out there,   Just lift your hands right now   Just say this with me   Father, I thank you For forgiving me of everything I’ve ever done   For Jesus walking with me   For dying for me   Raising for meAnd all my sins have been forgiven   I’m a changed man   I’m healed, I’m delivered, I’m rich   And it’s all because of him   Now walk with me   Walk wit me, walk, walk, walk wit me   Walk wit me
