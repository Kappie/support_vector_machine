My jeans (which I was still wearing) were twisted sideways, and rather uncomfortable. My light was still on, so I turned it off, took off my pants, and tried to go back to sleep. My parents woke up. My brother woke up. The usual bickering and fighting ensued. I covered my head with a pillow. My mom came to my room and started yelling something at me about the internet. Yes mom, I will hook it up, but you have to realize, Telus has to do their part, and I'm not going to sit around all day until they call and say that everything should be ready to go. Then I told her to go away. She pointed out that I was already up because my light had been on earlier this morning. Obviously, she has never fallen asleep with the light on.  I am hanging out with Krystal today. I have no idea what we're going to do. I'm sure I'll dress up all nice, shave my face, cut my toe nails. I don't think I've cut my toenails since before Crystal and I went our seperate ways. Maybe I'm holding on to something. Maybe I'm just lazy.   My dad has been nagging me about school. Him and my mother. They both desperately want me to go to RDC, although I have no clue why. I think I am taking Business Administration, but I was comparing the course at RDC to the one in Lethbridge, and the one in Lethbridge looks one hell of a lot better.  and so, I plot my escape . I think it would be a great place to go...it would be good for me. My parents, they have no idea how badly I need out of this house, out of this town. Red Deer, that place is no better. I am anxious, I've been here too long. I'd say I feel like I've overstayed my welcome, but it's almost the other way around, like this area...Red Deer, Sylvan...it's overstayed it's welcome in my life.  and the town stopped pulling it's weight .  Hm. Should I post the poetry from last night? No.  I'm not allowed to feel those emotions.
