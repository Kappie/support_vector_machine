I was totally into the entire thing. The way it was portrayed was absolutely amazing. I think it showed a more realistic approach to what Jesus really did go through. Even so, I don't understand the whole controversial point to it. It didn't seem to show any indication that Jews were responsible for his death. It simply showed the facts. I was extremely impressed with the camera angles and filming as well. It all looked so real. To summarize, it was  very well done.   This is the twentieth post I have published in less than a week. I have hit over 5 500 words too, I guess it shows, eh? I love it though. I have gotten so many things off of my chest and it feels good. It also feels good to know that people read it and leave me comments. It's also inspired me to write from my head, and not to worry about any ridicule. I can say anything I want, and it can only indirectly effect anyone. In other words, this is a way to get a point across without offending anything or anyone.  I have been in and out of reflective moods recently. I go from thinking about one thing, to completely forgetting about it and doing something else. I don't know whether or not it's on my part, in being that I am suffering from lack of concentration, or if I am just trying to shut thoughts out of my mind. Either way, I will never be able to shut anything out of my mind. I think so much sometimes, I keep myself up at night.    Seemingly complex, yet exceedingly intriguing thoughts unfold, but I find myself yielding, whether or not to make sense of the situation,  perhaps it's a figment of my vivid imagination  One thing is for certain, I can feel it is true, it's like my sanctuary at heart, with exceptions make do, a deep piece of intellect, waiving my faith, it's like the sun and the moon, so slow and so paced,  With windows and doors, and long hallways and lights, I feel as if I am dreaming, and perhaps I am right To be known, to be seen, is something so true, but at times the perception, is difficult to undo  A fight and a battle, makes nothing but war, only I am able to understand, my concepts galore, To see and to fathom, are two different things, but one thing's for sure, my mind will always keep, wandering.

That's what I love about it. Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed today's post.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Talk to you all later. Leave me a comment so I know you were here :)
