They were sort of on a diagonal, but at first, as I read from left to right, something seemed wrong:  TAKE CHANGE   CONTROL YOUR LIFE  Which is fine advice, and perhaps speaks to the state of opportunities in this economy for people with degrees from community college.  But I thought was a poor market message.  Read top to bottom instead:  TAKE CONTROL   CHANGE YOUR LIFE  Somehow that seems to make more sense.
