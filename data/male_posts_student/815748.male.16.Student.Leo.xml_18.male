They lived in the Sarah Dessert and traveled by Camelot.  The climate of the Sarah is such that the inhabitants have to live elsewhere, so certain areas of the dessert are cultivated by irritation.  The pyramids are a range of mountains between France and Spain.  The Egyptians built the pyramids in the shape of a huge triangular cube.  The Bible is full of interesting caricatures.  In the first book of the Bible, Guinessis, Adam and Eve were created from an apple tree.  One of their children, Cain, asked, "Am I my brother's son?"  God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on Mount Montezuma.  Jacob, son of Isaac, stole his brother's birthmark.  Jacob was a patriarch who brought up his 12 sons to be patriarchs, but they did not take to it.  One of Jacob's sons, Joseph, gave refuse to the Israelites.  Pharaoh forced the Hebrew slaves to make bread without straw.  Moses led them to the Red Sea, where they made unleavened bread, which is bread made without any ingredients.  Afterwards, Moses went up on Mount Cyanide to get the ten commandments.  He died before he ever reached Canada.  David was a Hebrew king skilled at playing the liar.  He fought with the Finkelsteins, a race of people who lived in Biblical times.  Solomon, one of David's sons, had 300 wives and 700 porcupines.  The Greeks were a highly sculptured people, and without them we wouldn't have history.  The Greeks invented three kinds of columns �� corinthian, ironic, and dorc �� and built the Apocalypse.  They also had myths.  A myth is a female moth.  One myth says that the mother of Achilles dipped him in the River Stynx until he became intollerable.  Achilles appears in The Iliad, by Homer.  Homer also wrote The Oddity, in which Penelope was the last hardship that Ulysses endured on his journey.  Actually, Homer was not written by Homer but by another man of that name.  Socrates was a famous Greek teacher who went around giving people advice.  They killed him.  Socrates died from an overdose of wedlock.  After his death, his career suffered a dramatic decline.  The government of Athens was democratic because people took the law into their own hands.  There were no wars in Greece, as the mountains were so high that they couldn't climb over to see what their neighbors were doing.  When they fought with the Persians, the Greeks were outnumbered because the Persians had more men.  Eventually, the Romans conquered the Geeks.  History calls people Romans because they never stayed in one place for very long.  Julius Caesar extinguished himself on the battlefields of Gaul.  The Ides of March murdered him because they thought he was going to be made king.  Dying, he gasped out the words "Tee hee, Brutus."  Nero was a cruel tyranny who would torture his poor subjects by playing the fiddle to them.  Rome came to have too many luxuries and baths.  At Roman banquets, the guests wore garlics in their hair.  They took two baths in two days, and that's the cause of the fall of Rome.  Today Rome is full of fallen arches.  Then came the Middle Ages, when everyone was middle aged.  King Alfred conquered the Dames.  King Arthur lived in the Age of Shivery with brave knights on prancing horses and beautiful women.  King Harod mustarded his troops before the Battle of Hastings.  Joan of Arc was cannonized by Bernard Shaw.  And victims of the blue-bonnet plague grew boobs on their necks.  Finally, Magna Carta provided that no free man should be hanged twice for the same offense.  In midevil times most people were alliterate.  During this time, people put on morality plays about ghosts, goblins, virgins, and other mythical creatures.  Another story was about William Tell, who shot an arrow through an apple while standing on his son�s head.  The Renaissance was an age in which more individuals felt the value of their human being.    It was the painter Donatello�s interest in the female nude that made him the father of the Renaissance.  The government of England was a limited mockery.  From the womb of Henry VIII Protestantism was born.  Queen Elizabeth was the �Virgin Queen.�  As a queen she was a success.  When Elizabeth exposed herself before her troops, they all shouted �hurrah.�  Then her navy went out and defeated the Spanish Armadillo.  It was an age of great inventions and discoveries.  Gutenberg invented the Bible.  Another important invention was the circulation of blood.  The greatest writer of the Renaissance was William Shakespeare.  Shakespeare was born in the year 1564, supposedly on his birthday.  He lived at Windsor with his merry wives, writing tragedies, comedies, and errors.  In one of Shakespeare�s famous plays, Hamlet rations out his situation by relieving himself in a long soliloquy.  In another play, Lady Macbeth tries to convince Macbeth to kill the King by attacking his manhood.  The proof that the witches in Macbeth are supernatural is that no one could eat what they cooked.  The next great author was John Milton.  Milton wrote Paradise Lost.  Then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained.  During the Renaissance America began.  Christopher Columbus was a great navigator who discovered America while cursing about the Atlantic.  Many people died and many babies were born.  Captain John Smith was responsible for all this.  One of the causes of the Revolutionary War was the English put tacks in their tea.  Finally, the colonists won the War and no longer had to pay for taxis.  Thomas Jefferson, a Virgin, and Benjamin Franklin were two singers of the Declaration of Independence.  Franklin had gone to Boston carrying all his clothes in his pocket and a loaf of bread under each arm.  He invented electricity by rubbing two cats backwards and declared, �A horse divided against itself cannot stand.�  Franklin died in 1790 and is still dead.  Soon the Constitution of the United States was adopted to secure domestic hostility.  Under the Constitution the people enjoyed the right to keep bare arms.  Abraham Lincoln became America�s greatest Precedent.  Lincoln�s mother died in infancy, and he was born in a log cabin which he built with his own hands.  When Lincoln was president, he wore only a tall silk hat.  He said, �In onion there is strength. 	 Abraham Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address while traveling from Washington to Gettysburg on the back of an envelope. On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln went to the theater and got shot in his seat by one of the actors in a moving picture show.  Meanwhile in Europe, the enlightenment was a reasonable time.  Voltaire invented electricity and also wrote a book called Candy.  Gravity was invented by Isaac Walton.  It is chiefly noticeable in the autumn, when the apples are falling off the trees.  Johann Bach wrote a great many musical compositions and had a large number of children.  In between, he practiced on an old spinster which he kept up in his attic.  Bach died from 1750 to the present.  Bach was the most famous composer in the world, and so was Handel.  Handel was half German, half Italian, and half English.  He was very large.  Beethoven wrote music even though he was deaf.  He was so deaf he wrote loud music.  Beethoven expired in 1827 and later died for this.  The French Revolution was accomplished before it happened and catapulted into Napoleon.   During the Napoleonic Wars,  the crowned heads of Europe were trembling in their shoes.  Then the Spanish gorillas came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon�s flanks.  The sun never set on the British Empire because the British Empire is in the East and the sun sets in the West.  Queen Victoria was the longest queen.  She sat on a thorn for 63 years.  The nineteenth century was a time of a great many thoughts and inventions.  People stopped reproducing by hand and started reproducing by machine.  Cyrus McCormick invented the McCormick raper, which did the work of a hundred men.  Louis Pasteur discovered a cure for rabbis.  Madman Curie discovered radio.  And Karl Marx became one of the Marx brothers.  The First World War, caused by the assignation of the Arch-Duck by an anahist, ushered in a new error in the anals of human history.
