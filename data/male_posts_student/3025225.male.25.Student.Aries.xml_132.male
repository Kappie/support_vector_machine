Sometimes the majority only means all the fools are on the same side Every bird loves to hear himself sing  Faint heart never won fair lady Never go to bed on an argument Quickly come, quickly go In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has Plant the crab tree where you will, it will never bear pippins
