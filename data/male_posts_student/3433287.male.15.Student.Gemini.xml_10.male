I got to the beach and sat down, it started to drizzle, no biggie i thought...KABOOM, here comes the giant drops of death that hurt like hail.  See now, if i was some panzy ass kid (or just someone who didnt like rain) i wouldnt have kept sitting there waiting for the sun to rise. (knowing it wouldnt but shhh, its my cover up)...so i start my bike ride home in the kick ass rain, and im having fun, almost went swimming in the pond of the long beach golf course...haha...but i didnt, but i will, here me out people, i will swim in that pond by the end of this summer...yeah, thats right...so fuck you.
