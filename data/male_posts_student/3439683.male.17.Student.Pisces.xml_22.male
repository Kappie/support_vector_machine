Scary thing is, that could actually happen. Read a PopSci article on it. Found it rather depressing to have to go to the movies with my mom. Found myself wanting some actual companionship, and there was none to be had.  I'm determined not to rant and rave tonight about what I don't have. I did decide what I can use this for though. Gonna give it out to people that I want to know the real me, that I trust them with that knowledge...so, Luke, if you see this, you know why I gave  you the address. Let's see....Karlie, Courtney, Jessica, maybe Ashley....those are the only other people I can think of right now who I'm going to give this to. Gotta go e-mail a couple of those people right now, so I'm outta here.
