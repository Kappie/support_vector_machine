I don't get the opposing forces in my head. One says to nuke the arab sons of a bitches after seeing many videos of how they kill each other (plant bombs on people and boom) and the other side says god damnit humanity is a clump of foolish primitive morons that fight useless wars mostly over retarded religions. I don't get why people bother with religion it's hopeless and fake. I'm sick of this world, I'm gonna take my anger out on the drums.
