Your Eyes  When I look at you I see a girl that's incredibly shy But it's hidden under a very good disguise I wonder why this other person you deny When to see I only have to look in you eyes.  That window to your soul that will always supply The answers to my questions, and they tell me no lies WHy is it so hard for you to realize The person  you really are, lies within your eyes.  You act doesn't fool me, (what a suprise) Let  you true colors show, that would be wise. When I see your fake personality, a part of me dies Because I know the true beauty is in your eyes.  Your eyes that always seem to cry Because no one know the truth of y ou demise You're scared to show your charm, but why? When it bleeds through your eyes.
