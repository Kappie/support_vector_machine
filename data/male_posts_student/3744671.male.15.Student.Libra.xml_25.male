Obviously, this one is only for PC games so it won't tell you about Xbox Live or PS2 online, etc.  Anyhow, why it's cool is that it's an instant messenger that you can quickly download for free at  urlLink xfire.com   It will show you what your friend is playing online, and allow you to join, chat, etc. Pretty cool for those who play alot online. Obviously, you only see gamers who you've added like you would via MSN or ICQ, etc.  If I ever get high speed (very unlikely, very, very unlikely) expect to see this gamer online with all the cool ones from Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, etc! Until then, I don't find much use for this when I can only play StarCraft, Age of Empires, and other RTS games online.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
