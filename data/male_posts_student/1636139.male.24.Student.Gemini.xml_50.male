The 1st thing I learned was that karaoke is a lot harder than some people make it look. The 2nd thing I learned was that it helps if you know the song  really  well. It also helps to sing with a bunch of other people  use a song with an energetic chorus that falls comfortably within your vocal range. 
  
Although I got a ride home from some random people I met there, I had to take the CalTrain from Mountain View to Palo Alto (3 stops) on my way there. Having never taken CalTrain before, I wasn't sure what to expect but it was quite a nice experience. The only downside to the night is that my bike is now at the closest VTA stop, which is a 5 minute bike ride away. I guess I'll have to go for a walk at some point today...
