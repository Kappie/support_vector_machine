Over 4,000 words written and 20 posts later(not to mention one loyal fan, *cheers for Ryo* thanks Ryo, you kept me blogging) we are finally here. Today was a good day, I got to play B-ball with Benny. He is supposed to come over tomorrow, but I found out I'm going to a theme park with one of my friends. I'm going with my friend Chris, he's pretty cool and he used to be my favorite friend until Benny moved in at Easter time. I feel really bad changing my best friends, but Chris isn't gay and Benny might be. It makes you wonder "How do you know Chris isn't gay?" Well I guess he is the first guy I tried to be with. It didn't work out to well, and for some reason Chris doesn't think I'm gay witch is supprising since I tried to screw him a few years ago. He just pushed me away and thought I was joking I guess. I've got all the Gravitation finally downloaded, now all I have to do is watch it all. Shuichi is my favorite, he is the best looking. Yuki is also pretty hot. I've got another good yaoi website. Its  urlLink YaoiHell , and its full of good yummy yaoi. Well I better get to bed so I'm not tired tomorrow. TTYL
