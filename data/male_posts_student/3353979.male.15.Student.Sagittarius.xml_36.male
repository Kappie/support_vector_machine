Over the past week i guess i put my life on hold while she was gone, i like her alot and she dosent feel the same way,, i have been quetioning alot of things,, are we friends, i dont know thinking back to winter were we spent months not talking and friends dont do that, friends cant do that.... Every day i feel like i dont belong in rural ridge, and nearly every day somthing happens that keeps me knowing that i dont belong here.......... Every day is find out what i can and can not do, every day i push my self to the limit know the risks and not careing and i do it because i think i can relieve the sadness im feeling, i cant play basketball and know i can play a few weeks ago i could and i know why i cant play its because im play for all the wrong reasons i was playing it because it was fun now i play it to get my mind on somthing else, to not be sad..... Every day i leave with out telling anyone, i leave because i started thinking and im not thinking any happy thoughts................ the music i listen to isnet helping i listen to that describes how i feel and who i am................
