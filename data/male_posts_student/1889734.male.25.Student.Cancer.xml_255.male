It should illustrate much when one considers that the UN is the organization to which the Left seeks to hand over the entire operation.  These are the people who are going to 'fix' the situation when we failed?  These are the people who can undertake the task with more competance than us?  When are we going to accept the reality that is the UN, and either demand serious reforms, dissolve the body and start over, or at the least, withdraw our support and money?  Pathetic.
