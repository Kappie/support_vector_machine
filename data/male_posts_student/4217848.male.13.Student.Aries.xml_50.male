I'm just as guilty as everyone else for telling people that I loved them after only going out for a week, but do you honestly believe you could know that in such short a time. Seriously, most middle school dating is just farce: a way to feel mature about something or feel like maybe someone cares about you. Maybe you do love that person as much as you say, but chances are that at this stage in your life, you don't. Especially if your relationship is based on making out in someone's attic.      The reason I'm harping about this today is because this hits close to home for one of my good friends. She has been dating a boy for months, maybe close to a year now, and those three small words are becoming a bigger and bigger problem. There relationship had a heavy foundation in-- you guessed it-- the physical, and not near enough attention was paid to the spiritual and emotional concepts of it. Now my friend wants to feel more in love, but her boyfriend just seems to be getting tired of the relationship, and she feels less loved now than before they started going out. The really sad part is that this kind of thing goes on every day because people who don't understand love still abuse it.       I guess its hard to tell, when you really do care about someone, whether you really love them or not. It's all too obvious that you do not love someone when the relationship wears thin. I know that, in my relationships, a lot of hearts have been broken over the things that we said and the things that we did because, in the end, it was nothing, and it was nearly impossible to mend a friendship after a break-up. Sometimes it really was impossible.      I guess I'm just trying to say if you really think you love someone, at least love them enough to make sure you don't ever hurt them on purpose.       With "love,"
