My original plam was to graduate from Ottawa University (a very respectable institution) and then proceed elsewhere. One little thing made me change my mind, however: I HATE OTTAWA!! Being a European born and bred in the big city I can no longer continue to live in a little hick town like Ottawa... I've never really liked Ottawa but now, after getting into urban photography et al, I can no longer stand this place. So I'm going to study my ass off to get into McGill and then hopefully I'll move out of hick-village Ottawa into the rather European city of Montreal. Wish Me Luck ;)
