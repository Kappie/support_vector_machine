Jody Gorran of Delray Beach said he believes the Atkins diet books and products should contain a warning label that one-third of the population is at risk for developing health problems when they eat meats and other foods endorsed by the diet that are high in saturated fat. what a total douche... did he really NEED a label?  does ANYONE need a label?  sit your fat ass down mr. gorran... and don't waste the people of florida's money by taking this to court.  speaking of food...  urlLink this  is one of those weird things where you wonder if it'll work.  $50 is a pretty big incentive... if you're outta work and you're up in new hampshire if this bill goes through... just drive around and start reporting people.  the question i ask though... how much parenting of parents should the government do?  a couple get togethers for their children's friends shouldn't be punished... at least they're supervised.  and more food... i don't really like  urlLink krispy kreme  all that much... i'm more of a  urlLink tim hortons  kinda guy.  anyways... LOW SUGAR DOUGHNUT?  what's a low carb doughnut?!  a doughnut is a giant thing of carb if you haven't yet noticed... that's preposterous... that's ridiculous... why would you want to take away the yummy goodness like that?  pretty soon we won't be able to eat anything... cause everything will be bad... we'll be left chewing on celery ("fat abbott... you need to looooose weight").  one last food  urlLink link ... damn... i feel like jody gorran.  so using the internet to buy groceries is expanding... unfortunetely for me... i never got to try  urlLink fresh direct  cause i think they didn't deliver to brooklyn until i was about to move or something.  i do remember getting food through priceline though... that was pretty cool... made grocery shopping on a college student's budget in manhattan a lot nicer.  too bad that service got shut down.  i also remember kozmo... i miss kozmo... they didn't have groceries... but they did bring snacky munchy stuff and movies =]... with their cool orange kozmo bags.  there's one thing in nyc you can develop really quickly... an attachment to your food guys.  there's my bagel cart guy on 14th and university... kumar @ the waverly diner... dolip @ the food emporium @ union sq... the chicken man up in murray hill... and the pizza guys @ mercato... it sure has been a long time.  go  urlLink flames  GO!  Surely there's a lad somewhere in Tampa, Fla., residing in a home with a broken air conditioner, who thinks that playing in the National Hockey League would, quite literally, be a cool thing to do.  Conversely, there are thousands of boys throughout Western New York for whom making it to the NHL is a 24-hour, 365-day obsession. They skate on frozen creeks and ponds or take their game to the streets, time and again scoring the goal or making the save that engraves their names on the Stanley Cup. To them, there's no worse feeling than being cut from the travel team, because being cut from the travel team usually means becoming a doctor, a lawyer, or a sportswriter.   There are a dozen legitimate reasons to root for the Tampa Bay Lightning over the Calgary Flames in these finals. And there's one overwhelming reason to root against them. Buffalo has never won a Stanley Cup, and it'll be a slap shot to the naked shins if the contrived hockey town of Tampa wins one first.  this is an old link from last week... about how hastert  urlLink lectured  mccain on military service and sacrifice.  i just thought it was funny given that he was directing it towards mccain... who served in vietnam and was a pow.  john mccain is one of only a couple people that identify with the republican party that i truly admire.  not much else to say about the article... just thought it was funny... not in a "ha-ha" way... more in an "oh... ummm... riiight" way.  my friend tina sent  urlLink this  to me awhile ago too.  it's michael berg writing about his son nick who was murdered a couple weeks ago in iraq.  i hope everyone in the bush administration read every word of it.  i hope everyone that wants this occupation to continue with no changes in the structure of our organization  have read this.  how can we at this point with everything that's gone wrong not realize that we're not doing things correctly?  how many more people do we have to give reasons to hate us?  how many is enough mr. rumsfeld?  10,000?  90,000?  500,000?  if this keeps up, it'll be far more than that.  we really need to let other countries in to at least defuse and mediate the situation a bit.  we have no credibility... how are we going to stabalize a country that doesn't trust us?  gotta stop hoarding that oil and let people help... it's not ours anyways.  interesting article on  urlLink convergence  and the possibility of deregulation of the telecommunications industry.  eventually i think deregulation would be beneficial... but i think we have to wait a bit for these converged technologies to develop.  i do think though, for the present, we need to provide a level playing field for the telcos as they're going up against deregulated cable.  if one industry dies out, it will not only affect our economy... but an entire infrastructure that's been built out already will be wasted.  hopefully the telcos will catch up... verizon has big  urlLink plans , but i'm not at all confident that they'll be able to acheive their goals to the satisfaction of their  urlLink customers .  in other telecom  urlLink news ... at is jumping back into wireless after at wireless was acquired by cingular.  doesn't say a lot for the division you spun off that bears your name if you wanted to get back into wireless but didn't want to just reacquire the division.  it's unfortunate qualcomm wants licensing fees for their cdma technology (which in my opinion has features that are better than gsm)... cause that limits people willing to use it.  if you have a gsm phone, you can pretty much use it anywhere in the world (most of the world's cell phones are gsm)... all you need to do is buy a sim card in the country that you're in.  why does this country LOVE to do things back assward?  the world health organization makes me laugh... especially after seeing ben and jeff do their bit... even though the  urlLink stories  involving the organization aren't funny... the headlines are... cause they're always questions... about someone... hehehehehe... eh... shyuddup.  WHO Confirms 19 Cases of Ebola in Southern Sudan  this  urlLink here  is pretty cool... it's so interesting that you can go around and dig and find things that were "lost".  the university's pretty big... i guess they took their edu-macation seriously.  and i guess some of you whiteys were right... you ARE  urlLink losing the country .  yup... we're gonna take your women and children.  this is intersting... perhaps i'll use this article for my sociology paper.  i wouldn't have guessed that immigrants would've lived longer on average given how supposedly medicine in the US is "better" and more advanced than other countries.  the difference isn't too much, though they didn't say what the life expectancy of immigrants were... i'd have at least thought it'd be lower or the same for someone moving into the US from another country.  ah... all caught up... now i can clear out a bunch of links that i've saved and was just keeping so i could write about em.  anyone have any interesting plans for the long weekend?
