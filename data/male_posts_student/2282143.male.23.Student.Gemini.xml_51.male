Politicians lie, but when thousands of people die because of it, then its too much.  Im gonna make a short list of what I can remember off the top of my head what W. has done to screw up:  remember China and how we wanted to go to war with them back in early 2001ish?  Then there was the whole un-American thing.  After 9/11 a holy war (yes, I will say it) broke out pitting the Islamic world with us (even more so than ever).  Instead of saying that there were fundamentalist zealots who hate our way of life, it was the MUSLIMS who hate us.  If you disagreed that all Muslims must die, then you are un-American.  If you thought that the government was handling things wrong, you are un-American.  If you didnt have an American flag tattoo'd to your chest/shoulder/lumbar region, you are most definitely un-American.  Enron.  Enron Enron Enron.  I empathize with Martha on this one.  She gets dicked cause she is Martha Stewart, while these people who fleeced the shareholders out of a shitload of money pretty much walk away leaving a trail of unemployment, destruction, and corporate mistrust in its wake.  Then most notably, there is the WMD fiasco.  The more I hear about them trying to bullshit their excuse for the war, the more it makes me want to punch a Republican.  Saddam a threat my ASS.  Was he a nice guy?  Hell no.  Did he keep the really crazy fundamentalists in line?  Yes.  So is this war going to bite us in the ass in a few years?  Ohhhhh you better believe it.  Ever hear of a guy named Osama?  Wasnt it the government that trained him to terrorize the Russians back in the cold war?  Are you detecting a pattern here?  The best news in my mind comes from the former secretary of counterterrorism talking about how pretty much as soon as Sept. 11th hit, he wanted Iraq blamed so we could go in there guns blazing.  NOW WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS TELL YOU?  What about the money?  Economy still sucks.  I still dont have a job (HA!).  We are at the highest amount of national debt ever, rich get richer, poor get shit on, we have no social security plan, medicare is in the shitter, the government hired a freelance journalist to talk about the wonders of the new medicare bill that will actually cost us about 150 billion bucks more than we though.  And yet again, we were LIED to.  Tommy Thompson is as big as a screw up as Bush.  Have I made my point yet?   Yes, I still think Kerry is a schmuck too.  But his "I'm not Bush" campaign is still looking alot better to me than W's "I am Bush" campaign.  I am really at a loss for any sort of good or positive thing to say about Dubya.  At least Clinton was doing a decent job as president, so what if he liked getting a hummer every once in a while?  Who doesnt enjoy a good BJ every once in a while?  Im at the point where I dont even care if Kerry kills kittens in his basement in a satanic ritual or eats babies with beans and a nice chianti.  So with so many lies and so many lives lost, what would make you want to vote for W?  No, really.  I want an answer to that.  Please.  Enlighten me.  If you have half a brain, you would realize that I would make a better president than him.  My two year old niece would make a better one.  So if anyone comes up to me this November and tells me that they voted for Bush (A: because they are a republican or B: they dont like Kerry), I will personally punch them in the face without hesitation.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  However, in the event he does somehow happen to win, I will be organizing a mass exodus to Canada.  No, really.  Ive decided that I will give up my American citizenship if Bush wins again.  Besides, less crime, murder, etc in Canada, medical drugs are less expensive, everyone there is friendly, and they like pot.  Who's with me?!?!?!
