I've been a pretty good member of the blogging community since 2000 (the moment before the big boom of blogging), but my  urlLink last one  found me catching flak. So, I'm taking it down permanently. I find Blogging therapeutic, so I'm moving away from the Cary Project and starting over from scratch. I actually find this a good time to start one, since my Sophomore year ends next Wednesday, and I have a big summer ahead of me. I'm also getting a new computer, so by the time you see this I am using an  urlLink eMac  (April 2004 revision). Specs: 8x SuperDrive, 1.25gHz G4, 80G HD, 512M RAM, Bluetooth. I plan on not having to create a new blog for a loooong time. For now, just watch me as my summer unfolds!
