i guess it was, "what big secret are we going to have in this year's vma's?" mechy: "i don't care, as long as it isn't michael jackson and lisa marie presley kissing again." ooo, incendiary comments there. nice. hey, it beats jimmy fallon's *expletive deleted* in an ice cube.  yesterday was fun, again. i woke up early to eat half a bowl of fruity pebbles with the left side of my mouth, then jetted over to school to find amanda and play some basketball. we saw dorian practicing soccer by himself, that boy is insane. alex came soon, so we shot around for five minutes and then me and amanda went to play some tennis, and alex (who hates tennis with an unmitigated passion) stayed by his lonesome to shoot around. it was fun, amanda's backhands were really nice, but her forehands could use some work. but then look who's talking. i kinda got dizzy and everything turned all bright and fuzzy, but then the sky turned blue again and i was ok. we went back to alex and he beat me 3-1. then we went to the liquor store, amanda on her badass scooter, and bought drinks. then we went to the back of school and saw james, glenn (who's moving back to american...cool), jenny (blood? eww!), my brother, saagar, and gerber.   amanda wanted to go home but not by herself (even though all she does at home is like...shower...and...i don't know), so alex tried to fold her scooter but i did it in a flash. go me. the girls called and amanda wanted to see who alex's squeeze was. we met them in front of the tennis courts, and amanda recognized gay-ZELL cuz she looks like scoth apparently? then the girls and alex played some tennis ("i hate tennis!"), so me and amanda played basketball. the girls didn't want to play, so they went to the gym. alex can't do a layup to save his life. the girls were on the monkeybars, which reminded me of last year when i couldn't reach that top bar then i finally did was really happy and alex saw me then i let go and fell on my ass. then amanda had to go home so me and alex followed the girls, he wanted to race me on his bake so i sprinted really fast and alex was slow then i passed the alcove into the gym and gayzel or natasha was like boo! and i felt really stupid. then we walked to the swings in los cerritos (on the way, gayzel was like, "i didn't know geese could fly"). everybody but sindy got on a swing and i finally learned how to swing high. we went to jack and no one bought anything, then we decided to go to my house to get some "big, hard" peaches. my dad was home though, but we came in anyway.   we gingerly stepped across the threshold cuz my dad was home and we watched some 8 mile. sindy kept on trying to squeeze next to natasha and whenever i gave her a pillow she hit natasha with it. kat dropped off erik (erik should be commended for having the gall to sit in an automobile driven by the notoriously fiendish motorist known as katherine leung) then we gawked at his phone. me and natasha switched places, but sindy curled up even smaller. it felt like that one night at ankur's house. they left, i got pissed cuz my brother stole my medicine and ipod ("it's cuz he borrowed my racket and, um, he stared at us during practice!" fag), but we ate. then my dad and uncle left to the hospital so i watered the front lawn (and got scared cuz the sprinkler almost got me wet), then i dried my basketball cuz it was in the line of fire...er...water. then i played for a bit, hella people passed by, then i turned on instinct to the side around 8-ish cuz cars drive in all the time and i don't like getting run over you kno, and i looked right at alex. me and alex played basketball and he murdered me 11-0. 11-0! bageled! donuted! that's not even a word, that's how bad it was. there was some kid staring at us from a 2nd story window. stalker!   powerpuff girls...we said sindy talks like bubbles and she had blue on, and natasha is blossom cuz she's tallest so she's kinda like the leader. so gayzel was stuck with buttercup and she threatened to hit me. she also had some green on, which she doesn't like cuz it's a horny color. but buttercup is cool cuz she beats all the people up. i was the professor cuz i had glasses, and alex was the MONKEY! gayzel found chalk and everyone started writing stuff, sindy thought she found chalk, but it turned out to be rock. then she found another piece, but it was actually styrofoam. then we went to alex's house, the girls were chatting, actually it was just sindy ghostwriting for everybody cuz she types fast. natasha likes gta cuz you can run over senior citizens. gayzel: "do you have any killing games?" alex took pics of all the girls and drew weird things like, sindy with a stick figure on her head. we looked at alex's first msj elementary yearbook (it was paperback...it's msj for god's sakes! msj!). gayzel's uncle and natasha's mom kept calling, alex's mom called once ("where am i? at home obviously, you called our home number"). then they left at 10, and i ran home. i took medicine and rinsed my mouth with salt water (now i remember why i hate the beach), then i watched daily show and fell asleep without knowing it. my dad woke me up and looked pissed. i slept...walking around at night looking at the stars is nice. don't take that for granted, in la the smog is so bad you can't ever see any.
