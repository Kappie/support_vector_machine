So, until we meet again I leave you with a little story...  I was awaiting a train to arrive at Edinburgh Waverly, and during my vigilant watch I grew slightly peckish. Heading for the nearest WH Smith I bought a backet of chocolate raisins, and a newspaper (too read, not too eat). Sitting down at a nearby table, I was shortly joined by another man, middle aged and wearing a posh buissness suit. It was precisley because of this "I'm a respectable accountant." appearance that I was so shocked when he reached over, opened my packet of chocolate raisins, and helped himself to a handfull. I was speechless. I could'nt believe this was happening, the man looked mature and respectable, and here he was stealing my candy! Unfortunatley the Brittish aren't good in these sort of situations, and I was so taken aback I didn't know what to say. Instead I pretended to ingnore him, and reached out and took a few myself. "Ha, that'll show him!" I thought to myself. Nope, after a few moments pause, he reached out and took another handfull. How dare he! Now seriously peturbed, the only thing I could thing of doing was to continue politely ignoring him and hope he whent away. I reached out once more and took another handfull of sweets. Oh dear, the man next to me did exactly the same thing a moments later. Well, we continued like this for several minutes, both acting as if nothing strange was happening. Eventually we got to the bottom of the packet, at which point the man got up and walked away. I couldn't believe it, of all then nerve, and whats worse is he got away with it! Now in a seriously bad mood, I picked up my newspaper and headed of toward my train. And under my newspaper I saw my bag of chocolate raisins. So there you have it, there is another person somewhere in the world who has  exactly  the same story as me, but he hasn't got the punchline.  Thanks for reading Stay Beautiful Davus
