My mom ordered a pizza with half cheese and half pepperoni. The lady was like "We put cheese on ALL of our pizzas so you really want to say that you want just a pizza with half pepperoni." No shit. I mean really, what a ignoramus. That is probably the longest word I have said in a while. For all you slower folks out there, an ignoramus is an idiot.
