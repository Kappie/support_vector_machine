There was a wee spot of trouble with the delivery when the delivery guy went to the wrong address, despite having the correct one on the package, but it eventually made its way to me in  urlLink a nice black box . I named it Hermod, after the Norse messenger of the gods. So far it has been highly satisfactory, aside from a minor problem with the latch that keeps the lid shut when it is closed. 
  
As most of the world probably knows by now, California has elected a new governor. 
He wasn't  urlLink my 1st choice  but I can live with it.
