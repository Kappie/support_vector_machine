I missed kelly so much. and i just wanted to say that i love you very much. I still havent got to talk to josh yet so i dont k if he is mad at me. Im writin my own book. Its about 20 pages so far. Ive started reading A midsummer nights dream by shakespeare. Its a really hard book to read. Anyways tha ride to the race track was 3 hours to long. It took forever to get home and my bro and sis were being annoying tha whole way home. Happy 63rd day anniversary kelly. I love you, and im not gonna kill muh self. DUR im not that dumb. Oh by the way our house its gettin Praised tomorrow. That means their gonna c how much or house cost. Were gettin it refinanced so we'll b able to get an inground pool next summer. That will b cool. I LOVE YOU KELLY
