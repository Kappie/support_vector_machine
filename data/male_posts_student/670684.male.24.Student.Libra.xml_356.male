Most of Marueen's emails get a quick glance and delete click from me, and I can safely say that I pay more heed to her tidbits than the majority of RTFers.  Is she going to be in the office?  What is the status of the conference for people interested in the history of print newspapers in Belize?    But anything Scandinavian is different, at least for me.  I am Scandinavian, at least a quarter of me is.  I am a second-generation American on my dad's side...never did I feel the stressors of the immigrant life that Maxine Hong Kingston did in The Woman Warrior, but I do feel a certain debtage to that side of the world that was once home to forebears.  Email conjured interest, and when a cut, paste, and click brings up a website offering money to do projects in the area, it's worth attention.    Only I don't know anything about that side of the family.  Up until four years ago, I was under the impression that my lineage was Swedish...turns out it's Norwegian (and my dad, a first generation American, still says he's Swedish, even with irrefutable proof otherwise).  My dad's father and my grandmother were divorced in the early 1950s, and Al Moe Sr. married Elizabeth of Arizona, and they had a family that I had quite small contact with.  Al Moe Sr. died in the 60s.  Liz Moe died in 2001.  Virgina, my dad's mother, knows little about the Moe clan.  And my dad's reply to my questions:   They're all dead.     Except I can't believe it.  There've got to be people out there that I'm somewhat related to, in some sense or form.  I've got the original last name,  Kvemo , changed in 1903 on arrival to America for easier pronunciation.  I know the town, Slovobrisk, a border town in the northeast area of Norway, that legend has it was often traded between Sweden and Norway.   It's been 101 years since anyone from my family was there...40% of America's history passed in that span.  But it's just two generations for my family, and I honestly believe that if I set out for that town, I'll find family.    Recently, I've seen a number of self-reflexive documentaries, with the filmmaker as protagonist, allowing his or her story to become the story of the audience...yes, we might not be in Palestine, our jaw may not be broken from a hate crime, and our parents might not be putting vinyl siding on the house...but it resonates when it's done well, because the stories are all about things larger than the event on-screen.    My story is about the loss of culture, the loss of roots.  I have family in Arkansas who will stay in Arkansas.  I have a mother who was an army brat, and wants to move around.  I want to move too.  But I'd like to have a home.  And I don't feel like I do.  And society doesn't really seem to put too much stock in where I came from, but I think it's got to be damn important.  Add to that story a sense of tradition...my dad speaks highly of tradition, the lineage of the family name that he doesn't know.  I'm the last one, and the one before me is a drunken jackass.  It's not Whale Rider...but if there's a land to discover.    This could be all the mythical history that I expect of Norway.  Who says that there will be a wise old man from the village who can trace Norwegian lineage, and direct me to the doorstep of kin, who will welcome me with open arms into their home, and fashion a wood-carved bowl for my usage?    I think it would be fascinating...start with me in San Diego, trying to get what information I can out of my dad and grandmother.  They've got some papers of Al Sr's, a birth certificate, some citizenship stuff...just a taste, but enough to get started.  By sheer coincidence (the coincidence that documentary film thrives on), the woman next door to them is fluent in Norwegian, and she has done a bit of translating before...why not do it for the camera?  We then come back to Austin and find a translator to come with us (or we find the translator first).  Then it's on a plane to Norway, and trains from Oslo to the city.  And then we search.  Cold search.  Hit the hot spots, look for the town elders, find whatever information we can on the family.  It's great if we find people I am related to, but if not, we still make it into a film.    I was planning to go anyway.  Why not take a camera and try to create something larger than the trip?  Helps if I can get the money, though.
