This morning, got the oil changed, put on some new wiper blades, and GOT THE BLOODY ALARM REMOVED!!!  Yay.  Finally.  For those of you who didnt know, my car alarm goes off if you breathe on the hood.  It would be set off by trucks going by, snow plows, low flying airplane/helicopters, etc etc.  It would even go off in Michigan if Sam's stereo was too loud.  Needless to say, I never need an alarm where I live and it was just a nuisance.  So good riddance.  Sweet.  Also today is the day.  Grandma is moving in to spend her final days surrounded by people who care.  Sounds kinda morbid, huh?  But I mean, I would rather die with my family than in some home or hopsital.  I wont lie, I will give it to the end of the summer if not sooner.  Atypical parkinson's blows and I wouldnt wish that disease on anyone.  Life is becoming more difficult, and she knows that the end is near.  I can even put some of my CNA skills to use (and no, potty breaks are not happening, I mean more like painting nails or spending time with).  Ok, well, whatever.  I might miss TKD tonight to move her in, which kinda makes me sad cause I feel like Im neglecting that lately, but oh well.  Family comes first.  Now, on to school.  One more week.....  sweetness.
