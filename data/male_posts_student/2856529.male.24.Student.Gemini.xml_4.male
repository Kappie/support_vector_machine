I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 and I liked the movie for its slick styling.I have realized that it might be a little too late in the day to write a review now so instead I am writing my thoughts. First of all, the movie made me angry, very angry. The president has consistently proven himself to be quite a showstopper with his dim-witted remarks on issues ranging from his golf game to the war in Iraq not to mention his picture perfect expressions when he is flummoxed by the questions posed by journalists in the movie. But to be completely fair to W, Michael Moore has chosen moments, which showcase the president at his worst or are totally out of context. Besidesthere is no doubt in my mind that the movie is completely biased. Like for example when Moore narrates that "…decided to invade the sovereign nation of Iraq that has never harmed an American...". But some of the more poignant moments for me in the movie were the sound bites offered by the troops where they put it quite matter of factly that "…its all about the rush". All in all I would be quite surprised if the movie did not have an impact on the educated urban voters who want the election to be decided based on issues closer to home like the bad economy and are loathe to giving a president who dragged the country into two wars a second chance at running the country.
