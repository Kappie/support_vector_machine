Well, my life lately hasn't been great. My dad has the flu, and could have to go to the hospital.   The second semester has started at school. When I get a 4.0 GPA, my parents will pay me $500 cash, and I also get an unlimited gas card.   I can't wait! Stefani doesn't feel that it is right for my parents to pay for gas. I don't know why. I'm going to school, which they help pay for, so I don't know why it makes a difference.  So Monday night, I picked up my car! I'm so happy! Here is a picture of it:     Isn't it purdy? Lol.   Anywho. I guess I am outta things to say. I probably won't write more till Friday. But I dunno.
