Today I’ll start by responding about why do I put so many lyrics. I’m not proud to say that I don’t know a thing about music, that meaning cords and instruments, but I’m proud of knowing obscure and rare songs that mostly escape the “mass produced” area. This way, to me, music represents a state of feel. I try to find music that reflects my mood and my personality. I’m a drama queen, so most of the music I listen to tends toward drama. Then if you want to know how am I feeling at the moment, pay attention to the lyrics in my posts, they reflect it.  Therefore, in the same matter. What am I listening at this moment? It all depends on the day, and the media. CD speaking, I’m listening to old favs:  Tony Braxton’s “Secrets” (specially tracks 3, 6 and 10);  Vonda Shepard’s “Songs from Ally McBeal”;  Jewel’s “Pieces of you”;  The Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Californication”;  The Verve’s “Hurban Hymn”;  Maroon 5’s “Songs about Jane”.  Audioslave’s “Audioslave”, and the all time fav, Sarah McLachlan’s “Afterglow” (track 7).   My mp3 player has a mix selection that goes sort of this way: Dido’s “White Flag”; All Saints’ “Never Ever”; Eddie Vedder’s “You’ve got to hide your love away”; Jennifer Holliday’s version of “Fools Rush In”; Rod Stewart’s “The First Cut is the Deepest”; Jay Jay Johanson’s “I guess I’m just a fool” and “Suffering”; Sarah’s “Song for a Winter’s Night” and “Do What you have to Do”; Oasis’ “Stop Crying your heart out”; Lisa Ekdahl’s “It’s Oh so quiet”; Cher’s “Strong Enough”; R.E.M.’s “Everybody Hurts”, and some others.  And my computer is around the 1000 songs, in the future being 3000 as soon as I have the backup disks form the old hard drive. So yeah, I don’t know how to play an instrument, but music is a big part of my life. Music I like because it says something to me, not everyone else.
