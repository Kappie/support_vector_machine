For god's sake, IM only 16! Anyway. I just thought I would update this. Some people start to complain if there isn't a post every freaking day. I've started writing in my paper journal again. I haven't written in that since the 29th I think. I've been listening to some new bands recently. They go as follows: Hot Rod Circuit - Sorry About Tomorrow, .hopesfall. - The Satellite Years, Mae - Destination:Beautiful, Midtown - Living Well Is the Best Revenge. my favorite is Hot Rod Circuit. you should go pick up that CD, its tight hahaha.
