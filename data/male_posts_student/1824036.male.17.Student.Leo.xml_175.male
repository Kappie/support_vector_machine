I play a few songs by  urlLink New Found Glory ; Hit or Miss, My Friends Over You (the first guitars moving part played at the intro is a little tough for me), and last but not least Head On Collision (still working on the solo a little). I can play those songs almost fluently so go me.  A couple songs I play by  urlLink The Offspring  are; Gotta Get Away (this song sounds tough but is very easy), and The Kids Aren't Alright ( urlLink Noodles  is a stud and I have no clue how to play the solo...but Im working on that one too)  The songs our band knows fluently is still low. We can play Swing Swing by  urlLink The All American Rejects  and if we had the solos we could pull off Kids Aren't Alright by  urlLink The Offspring . Other than that...we aren't too good. We dont have a very good vocalist. Dan wants to try to play all the leads but I think he rushes everything and kinda goes all  ADHD  on us. He also doesn't take it as seriously as most of us do...but oh well.  Not like it matters too much....
