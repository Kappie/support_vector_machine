Maybe I just don't give a shit about anything anymore.   Maybe I never did.      I found myself with friends the other morning, talking about all my past girlfriends.   I quickly realized that almost all of them were...well...'special'.   A lot of my friends were probably jealous that I had...Someone, and they had no one. Well, I honestly think I'm a hell of a lot better on my own. All of my girlfriends have been nothing but trouble.       Someone really fucked up once said: "Behind every great man, there is a woman."    You know what? Fuck that.   If there is a woman, she's probably not a great one. And the great ones are gettin harder and harder to find. Or at least in my life they are. Seems like almost all the ones I know are hellbent on fucking up my life as much as possible.    Whatever.    Bitches come and go, right?      Anyways, I'm here alone this week. Everyone's out of town on some vacation with their family's.   Wish I could be out of town. At the beach. Hell, maybe even with out the family.    If only I could drive.     I'd be outta here faster than you can say 'road trip'.    As soon as I get a fucking car, I'm doing these things:     Going to visit all of my friends that I've met on xbox live.    Planning a road trip with all my friends I've met on xbox live.    Going to the outer banks and living care free for a few days. Maybe by myself, maybe with...Someone. (Right now I can't really see who that 'someone' would be...)    Driving to New York to see the site of the World Trade Center.    Driving backwards down my street. Just because I can. Well I'd probably do that one before I do any of the other ones...but...who cares.      And my car would have one of those air freshener thingys that hangs from the rear view mirror.    Maybe some fuzzy dice.    And a hood ornament.    And leather seats.    And a bunch of other cool stuff that I would actually  use . Not just have in my car so I could say that I had a 2,000,000$ Security system, that activates in case of a monkey attack in the middle of the kenyan rainforrest in the middle of the night during a leap year.    ...Because that would be really stupid.        ...Losing it so fast...
