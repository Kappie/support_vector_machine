I have a paper to workshop for Thursday -- it has to be turned in at 8:00 pm Wednesday at the latest. So, here I am, procrastinating until the end...nothing less will do for Lafkak! Off the subject of my incredibly depressing workload, we went to the Octagonal Barn today on our MISSION INSCRIBABLE! Hooray! I found the barn interesting but not nearly as interesting as the three cute cats roaming around the building. I promptly sat down next to one and pet it to death while attempting (and failing) to complete my mission of describing the barn in two different viewpoints and making a story out of it by introducing a second character. Yawn -- just thinking about it bores me. If it weren't for the cats, the Mission Inscribable would've been a complete loss; the story I ended up writing very poorly was, in fact, in the feline perspective -- however, I found my writing while being distracted by my furry friends tended to be bland and unimaginative. Oh well. I have plenty of opportunities to be wacky and weird later. Wish me luck with my new story (anyone have any ideas?)!
