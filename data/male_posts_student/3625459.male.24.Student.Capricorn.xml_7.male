As much as i wanna text her and send her mails .. i keep trying not to .. there is no "us" .. its her and me... well now it more so seems like me ... she never gets online .. i've lost  her again . lost her like i did in december .. have this big viopd that no one can fill but her .. wish i made her feel the same .. why me god? why me ?  She came back when life was bleak .. notthats its any better now that i've lost her too.  Im trying not to give in .. my lifes in shambles.. i guess lifes a whole lot better when you have some one by your side ... just wish it was her  im off to work .. i guess i dont like coming online ..   I feel confused, these strange emotions that she brings about in me.At home things arent very good .Lisa's BF has moved in, makes me feel odd. I am hardly home offlate .Spend my time somewhere else or in the lab, go home at odd hours and hope that I dont see them. I ugessthats where C came in, she made me feel secure.   Why do i ever fallin love with people who dont care?
