Anyway, the NY Times has a  urlLink profile  of him in today's edition.  Says he's pretty much covered all of the travelogues he'd want to do, and his next book is a mini-biography of William Shakespeare:        "I don't want to go and start trying to make jokes in places like India, Tanzania or Iraq," he said. "Afghanistan is not a funny place."
