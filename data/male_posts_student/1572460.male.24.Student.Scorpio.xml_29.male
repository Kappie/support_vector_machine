Music being my be-all-end-all sort of thing at present, I'm helpless. As if adding fuel to fire, is the state of reaching a blogger's block, where I just cannot think about anything else to ramble on. So fellow bloggers, feel free to throw your brickbats. And then, if you prefer movies over music, I recommend watching Jack Black's  urlLink The School Of Rock . Quite simply, it's hilarious.  In my previous blog, I wrote that I was gradually getting over Rahman. Very true to a certain degree, but classic rock isn't a good enough reason to stop me from checking out another ARR release. I sometimes feel as if my brain has been temporarily manifested with some sort of a bipolar disorder, the one - psychiatrists would say - characterized by profuse and rapidly changing ideas. So, in the quest for that much needed variety-is-the-spice-of-life thing, like it happened today, you might find me listening to Led Zeppelin in the morning, and Jagjit Singh/ARR in the afternoon. Got ye all stumped, eh! Hardcore rock listeners try to convince me that rock music is akin to a rabbit-hole and that it takes time to dig in and feel comfortable with it. If you listen to classic rock on the radio, almost 70% of the rock borders on the side of pop, and most of the bands apart from a select few, appear to sound the same - i.e. the same traditional "triads" structure of music. I can imagine how the 60s-70s rock era gradually paved the way for more of the pop and grundge sounds of the 80s and 90s, and its nobody's fault. Music is bound to change with passing generations; and whether it has really evolved further or not, is completely upto the listener to judge. Getting back to the point about radios, because radios aren't for active listeners, and since I  am  one of  them  of late, I don't have the right to lament on the radio scene. Radio, is well...radio! My problem with rock music is, I'm either crazy about it or I am completely dispassionate. Radio doesn't work good for me, because I rarely listen to individual songs. I usually like the works of a band or an artist, as a whole. I'm more passionate about the entire "sound" or musical quality of a band, as opposed to hit radio singles. Nevertheless, radio is probably a fair means of getting introduced to a new genre of music.  urlLink Yahoo Launchcast  is a fantastic concept, where you can tune your radio to your liking by rating music. Moreover, they have a pretty impressive compilation, as long as you take some efforts to seriously rate the music you hear. All Yahoo needs to do now, is to spare a thought for the Linux user.  Anyways, back to a quick review of ARR's latest - Yuva. The music has grown by leaps and bounds since my first listening session a few weeks ago, when I thought it was far too popsy for my taste. It still  is , but not to  that  intensity. Going beyond the conventional pre-conceived notions about music, if I have to summarize Yuva in as few words as possible, I would say it's the "height of experimentation". ARR has gradually reached those unchartered territories as a musician/composer, where, perhaps only an elite bunch of musicians in India have successfully managed to reach. His knowledge of symphonic orchestration, sound arrangements, music programming and the wide range of creative sounds, continues to baffle me. In a sense, ARR is to Bollywood music, as Pink Floyd was to Progressive Rock. ARR uses "sounds" and "loops" which seem to go beyond the definition of traditional music theory. A musician's musician. In many of his compositions, he cleverly manages to catch the listener off guard, with subtle scale changes, sudden introduction/deletion of instruments in the most unusual fashion one could ever think of, pauses, fading ins-fading outs, etc. Critics call it as mere "fusion" of the eastern and western sounds, which, over the years, I have begun to feel, is such a cheap word to describe somebody as talented as this guy. Well, well...I could go on and on about this.  I liked all the tracks, except for, not surprisingly,  Dol Dol  and  Fanaa . Hip-hop/trance-like numbers are a strict no-no for me, and although they might boast of a few typical ARR percussion twists here and there (use of mridangam/ghatam), they're too typical and just too artificial. This type of stuff is  ideal  for rickshaws in Pune, that seem to be adorned with state-of-the-art hi-fi sound systems, blaring jhankar beats all the time. The remaining four tracks, fortunately, are examples of proper music, in their entirety. Opening track  Dhakka Laga Bukka  (somebody lyrics please!?!) has some mind-blowing strings and bass and contains some magical tricks that can only be captured on earphones. At one point, the drums do not sound like they are in a regular musical time pattern.  Khuda Hafiz  is Lucky Ali and Sunitha Sarathy all the way, and along with the harmony, there's a short yet wonderful bit of piano piece that steals the show.  Kabhi Neem Neem  is more of typppical ARR - a classical-folk extravaganza.  Badal  is a tremendous, tremendous song; my picks of the song being the spanish guitar leads (or is it mandolin/ukulele?) and undoubtedly, Adnan Sami's highly underrated vocals.   Yuva Pros : Experimentation, Experimentation, and Experimentation!  Yuva Cons : Could go down as one of those "average pop" albums, essentially targetted towards the youth.  And now, the only thing that will stop the flow of writing, is the smell of caffeine...
