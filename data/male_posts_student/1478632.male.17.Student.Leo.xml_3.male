In the parking lot for BJ's, I almost hit a guy who decided to park within three inches of me. Moron. Last Friday was Martin Sargent's last day on the ScreenSavers! :*( He has a new show on Monday to Thursday at 2300, on TechTv, so check it out. It's really weird...think Tom Green + Computer. I saw a segment where Martin went to the International Gourmet Kitchen Appliances Show in LA. Do you know why he went there? That's right. To get a blender! Oh yes, a blender. He went through the convention for about an hour to find the most badass blender there, and my oh my did he find a kickass blender! It was the PowerBlend 5000 from Kitchenaid, and it was a military-grade crusher-blender-pureer-killing machine. Check out Unscrewed at 2300 (That's 11pm for you military-impared ones) on TechTv. Well, I'm almost done with my house now. We have the plumbing in, and will have water by next weekend (yay!). After that, all we need to do is finish the electrical boxes then we can hang the drywall, lay down careting, and then do the finish work. I'll update some other time.  --Clash
