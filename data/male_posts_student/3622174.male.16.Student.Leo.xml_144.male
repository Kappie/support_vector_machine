So, here's a rundown of the whole day:   Homeroom:  Well, I thought we had to park at the library today because Melinda didn't have her parking permit yet, but, I was wrong.  So we parked at the library, and had to walk quite a way to get to the school.  We walked in right before the late bell, so, that was bad.  But, when we got there, we walked to homeroom.  Saw a lot of my friends that I hadn't seen all summer, which is pretty cool.  Got my schedule, and it was time to go.   First Period:  First period was Spanish II.  The teacher (Profe SpanishLady), is very, very boring, and very, very evil.  So, oh well.  18 weeks is going to go by really, really slow in that class.  She is too tight on her rules, especially the cell phone rule.  "If you have to shut your phone off during my class, you'd better not even look at it, otherwise, it's gone," said Profe Spanishlady.  That class will be incredibly boring.  Good thing there are some of my friends there.  Otherwise, I probably would die in there.   Second Period:  Second period is Executive Internship in the front office.  I'm up there for the first nine weeks.  Mrs. Announcer Lady and Mrs. Receptionist showed me and Bianca, my co-worker, around, and we started work.  We had several messages given to students, which required us to call around to several different classes.  This will probably be my favorite period of the day, but, we'll see what happens.   Third Period:  Third period is Yearbook.  Things are definitely going to be different this year.  We've got more organization this year, which is a good thing.  Today we basically just did an exercise to see what kind of working style we are.  I'm a South, which means that I check with others to make sure things are good before I go and create it.  So, that was an interesting exercise.  And we'll be busy with presentations and things all week.   Fourth Period:  Fourth period was Economics.  My teacher for that class is pretty cool, much better than I thought.  We'll do some interesting things in Mr. Economics Teacher's class.  People like Savannah, Clayton, Chris, and a bunch of other people I know are in there.  So, that's pretty cool.  And that's how my day went.  I won't post things that happen in my classes every day, mainly because it would bore people to death.  So, there won't be too much of that. Sometimes, I'll say stuff about my classes, but, don't expect too much.   That's about it for now.  I'll be back later on, but for now, I have to get to Digital Lust for today's update.  So, I'll be back here later.  Be sure to check back.  Tonight, I'll have Late Night Bloggin' at 10:30, and maybe something before that.  So, check back later, and I'll be back with more original stuff.
