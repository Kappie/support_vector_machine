'How can you not like football or rugby?' they say. This is why: Not only are sports very very dangerous, but they're dirty, rough, aggressive, tireing (sp?) etc. At school, the worst sport, in my opinion, we play is rugby. Somwhow I can't see what is fun about having 10 large men/boys charging at you ready to bash you to the grass, sorry, mud, only to get a small egg shaped ball that can't even bounce properly! Also, football... Last year, or the year before, we had some mornings off school because England were playing in a 'World Cup' competition. why were people so surprised to hear that I took the opertunity to have a slight lie-in and catch up on some homework? It's only a bunch of men kicking a ball around a field. And so what if our country does win? I don't think we did... Would us winning actually affect the lives of us in any way...? No. It was a great feeling however comming into school and being happy, whilst everyone else was sad because we lost.  More grumbles comming soon.
