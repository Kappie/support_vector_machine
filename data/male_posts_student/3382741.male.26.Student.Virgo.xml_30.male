It feel like one of my "usual" sinus infections.  Since it wasn't going away (not even with the drugs i snatched from mom's [maybe cuz they were expired]), I had mom take me to the Doctor (needed her to pay for it and I was too miserable to drive much).  We went to this place called Doctor's Care.  It's open weekends and evenings to be more convient for people who work.  It's a nice concept but I found the whole experience rather lacking.  It was in fact just about the worst visit to the doc I've ever had.  First, when I got there probably about 5 people were waiting in the lobby.  This is not too many one would think for a doctors office.  But as called them in only maybe one ever 30 min ... well lets just say I ended up waiting for like 3 hours before I got to see a doc.  My meds worse off after about 1 hour of being there so by the time I got to the doc I was shivering from fever and in severe pain.  What really anoyed me about the wait tho was this.  There were people who had left - I mean came and checked in and rather than wait in lobby they left then came back.  In my opinion if they are not there when called they should be be put at the very back of the line.  But no, when they came back they took them right in ... and they obviously weren't very sick.  Meanwhile I was still sitting there shivering and obviouly beyond miserable.  So I finnaly get back to see the doc and the nurse has to do nurse stuff (i.e. take my blood pressure, check heart rate, and) take my temp.  HOWEVER, when she got the thermometer it wouldn't work.  She kept trying and trying but nothing, then she was like "well let me go ask him what he wants me to do".  We are like thinking 'what they only have one thermometer'.  Then more waiting and finnaly the doc comes in.  He asks a lot of questions, no prob.  Then he starts pokeing me.  The usual feeling lymph node etc but he pushes WAY too hard.  He hurt me how hard he pressed in places that I wasn't even hurting before.  I told him I thought it was a sinus infection, but he thought it was more.  So to be thourough he took blood (well he didn't but he had the nurse come back for that) and they ran tests for infection and mono and also too a throught swipe to check for strep.  It was only an infection tho ... he said "it's not a sinus infection, just an infection" ... well I say it's an infection, and it's in my sinus so yeah it IS a sinus infection.  He gave me enough samples of an antibiotic so I won't have to buy any and wrote a prescrip for some decongestant and some stuff called magic mouthwash or some junk.  It's basically nothing more than chloroseptic (sp).  Interestingly enough my cousin had some and had given it to me to try just earlier today.  I told him that and that it doesnt work very well and asked for some stronger pain meds and fever suppresant, but he was like no (and not real nice about it).  In fact his overall demeaner needs some serious improvment.  I WILL NOT be going back there if I can help it.  I learned today that NyQuil is awesome stuff.  I have always heard people say it was good and boy they were right.  So for the moment I am feeling better and hopefully in a couple days it will be all gone.  I have missed two days of work and can't afford to be out anymore.  Nothing else new going on with me at the moment.
