He thinks hes the best player in the world hes having fucking teams come to his god damn house to sign him. The Lakers are making him the center of their franchise it would be sweet (?)irony/karma(?) if he got convicted leaving them with nothing.   Today (its 1am) begins soccer tryouts. I dont know what to think. All of a sudden I cant say that I dont want to play. I mean if I didnt make it I guess its expected  but if I do make it I guess its a bonus? I really need to play and for somereason I cant imagine myself not making the team. But who the fuck knows. I know that because of my laziness disease I dont want to go the damn team conditioning but I will most deff suck it up because its just gonna be like that or worse at United. Ah why do I have to change my mind. Now I'm gonna be disspaointed if I dont make it.
