Listened to the once in a lifetime performance of JJ Cale and Clapton together. Oh, and I got a little job with Randy the Master Framer. That may turn into a long-time assistant's job, but who knows? I'll just troubleshoot OSX and teach him the ropes of the Mac for a few hours, and organize his new Powerbook. Yum.  Another day, another dollar.  (ERIC-FRICKIN'-CLAPTON AND SANTANA, BEFORE MY VERY EYES! HEHEHE!)
