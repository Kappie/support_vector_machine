Millymollymandy and I secretly harboured hopes of taking Madness and getting either a refund or maybe swapping her for a meerkat or penguin.  Unfortunately they wouldn't let us.  Mean lot.    This week I may be on and off TCZ more than usual - my mum is having an operation (she has breast cancer) and so I don't know quite what will be going on.  Also, my brother will be home and he may be using my NTL connection.  I wish him joy as I thought Freeserve was bad.  NTL is driving me homicidal.  Maybe he'll be able to sort it.  I hope so anyway.   My op has been put back to September so its yet another waiting game.  As the (fabulous) Dorothy Parker says:  Life is a glorious cycle of song A medley of extemporanea And love is a thing that can never go wrong And I am Marie of Roumania  See you the next side of all this.
