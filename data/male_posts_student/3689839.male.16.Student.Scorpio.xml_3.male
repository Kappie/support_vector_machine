I would reccommend it to a newcomer to linux, but im thinking about switching to  urlLink slackware  or maybe  urlLink gentoo.  i hear that gentoo is pretty hard to get the hang of, but i like the idea of emerge. in fact, i think that other distros should incorporate something along the lines of many packages and programs available for download on one source. Ive been looking for a  urlLink gmail  account invite for a while as well. I think that a gig of space for email is pretty cool. However, ive also heard about them scanning your mail to tailor ads to your taste, and although it would be good that you wouldnt get random ads, i dont like the idea of somebody reading my mail. Still, the `1GB sounds really tempting. i hear that  urlLink spymac  also has 1GB mailboxes, but lacks the sleek and easy to use interface of gmail. I also hear that many "active" bloggers are getting invitations.   ttyl  mako
