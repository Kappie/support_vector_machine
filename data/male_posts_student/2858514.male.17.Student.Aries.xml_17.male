I hope I can finish the topic of conics before the release of HKCEE result.   Time passes quickly. It's almost time to think about HKCEE result. I'm optimistic, I think I can obtain enough points and get back to STMGSS. But the result won't probably be very good and I don't expect I can get an 'A'. Grading is not important now for me, being able to be in the original school is my only wish now.   My mathematics is not very good, but not bad. I think I won't face great difficulties on studying Pure Mathematics in F. 6. At higher form there are only 5 subjects, but they will be very demanding. I don't consider it as a problem since I enjoy the process of learning.   I'm so bored that I'm thinking what will I do after 11/8 if I can successfully get back to STMGSS. I've decided to buy textbooks as soon as possible and start studying it. You may say I'm crazy andI really am. I don't want to have a hard life on F.6, so pre-studying is a good method for me, and it also can kill some time. Anyway, this is only the best case. I haven't think of worst case yet, although the chance for it to happen is quite low.   Life's like a game and examinations are just parts of it. HKCEE is most exciting part of the game, don't feel frustrated when you lose, asthe game has to continue anyway.
