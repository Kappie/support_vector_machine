But anyway if there's anyone reading, today will be all about the French Open final between two wonderful players; Coria and Gaudio!  Well with all the drama and theatrics, it was absolutely impossible for me to keep away from this topic. First was the loss of a set to love by a frozen Gaudio. I kept my hopes alive of Gaudio winning, but after it reached 5-1 in the second set I thought it would be all over. But a spark can be re-lit in the presence of oxygen, I thought, and remembered how he climbed up from a 5-1 in the second against Nalbandian. For a moment that seemed to be the case, as he went up 5-3, but then he lost the set.  My Dad was saying that Gaudio did not deserve to be there, did not even deserve the challenge. My dear daddy, I thought to myself, " In an unfair world it matters not that you deserve to be there, but that you are there!" The crowd was all behind Gaudio, and he climbed back up a set 6-4. Coria had strained a muscle, and was experiencing cramps. Huge drama it was when he was reduced to a snail's pace and lost a set!  In the final set both men were exhausted and Coria seemed to have recovered from his cramp. But anyway with crucial breaks at almost every turn, tension was high, the crowd was restless and the cheering could only be stopped by hitting a serve. All the rest was bullcrap tennis and really is not worth mentioning. Gaudio won in the end, after all his nervous laughter and his funny antics.  With all the drama and the theatrics, I believe that if I were on court that day I would win. Because I, for one, can act!
