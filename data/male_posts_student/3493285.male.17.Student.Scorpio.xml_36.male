(everything within reason i.e. no having drinking yourself to the point of alochol poisioning..etc) and so this summer, i'm not holding back. i'm going to take chances. i'm gonna make mistakes. i'm going to just let myself go! it'll rock. it's sad because the 2 people i spent my summer with last summer will be gone for the first month. but hey..i still have the most amazing girl to spend my summer with MIRIAM MCSPADDEN ..cant think of a better way to spend my time then with a girl that i could just sit with in silence and be content with. and there are a lot of fish in the sea to hangout with aside from those who venture to say..new york for a ballet workshop. i dont know who would do that kinda thing?   this is becoming a long entry. i'm tired now. i think i'm going to make a few phonecalls and then hit the hay. do you guys ever use that expression? hit the hay?  because yes, i am a needy person, if you do happen to read this, could you comment? it makes me feel better about myself. and you know even if i check back on this and there are still 0 comments i will continue writing because..well..those with ADD need a place to put there random thoughts down on.   good night. i love you all. especially one girl in particular..
