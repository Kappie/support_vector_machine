THANK GOODNESS!  man... it was really soundin bad and nobody really liked it and it was just too hard so she dropped it.  that's good i guess.  our concert is in like a week... we really gotta get workin.  i mean we know our music i guess its just we need to fine tune it.  yeah.  well thats bout it i guess... for right now.  im off to piano lessons.  havent really been feelin much lately... just kinda blah.  like i dont feel anything... im just emotionless.  i guess i've been rather cold towards people lately.  its nothin personal... but whatever.
