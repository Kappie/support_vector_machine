WE talked for three hours on the phone, Then it died so I talked to her online for another three or four hours.  (^_^)   Then I talked to Theo as well, that was kool cause we both got some Gir Buddy Icons on AIM.  Then I played SpiderMan 2 till about 1 this morrning and went to bed.  I had the weirdest dream last night also. I cant describe it to well but all I remember is a shark. I hate dreams that are weird that I can not remember.   Last night though while I was talking to Rhae online she made me fix all my errors in my sentences...It was actually kinda fun ( that is really weird) But it was all cheese and bisquites. ( I hope that is right)   Well that is al I have to say for now...
