Planting also occurs in areas where the water table is threatened due to run-off caused by de-forestation. Shareholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (primary source of project funds) 2) Government divisions that support and fund projects (unfortunately none if any have offered to participate) 3) Aeta Communities (primary recipients of the projects) 4) Private Donors (majority of fund source funds comes from private donors)  Education (Out-of-School Youth and the Home Study Program) * Target population are those youth who have dropped out of school. Most reasons are for financial purposes. Many don't continue their schooling (primary or secondary) because they can't afford the cost of education (eg. school books, supplies, and transportation, are several factors affecting access to education). In addition the Home Study Program affects AWECA employees who have none or limited education (4th grade maximum is the average) as well as Aeta villagers who have various barriers and limited resources needed for an education (eg. lack of income to pay for school supplies and books, lack of transportation to a school, and lack of sustenance during schooling). Shareholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (Primary source of project funds) 2) Government divisions that support and fund projects (again, very little government involvement) 3) Private Donors (majority of funding of projects come from this source) 4) Angelicum College in Manila (creates the curriculum for the Home Study Program) 5) Children (the recipients of the Home Study Program course work) 6) Parents (the parents of the children who themselves may not be educated) 7) Schools and Teachers (as a resource to assist in the Home Study Program) 8) AWECA Employees (adult education recipients) 9) Aeta Villages (aduly and children eduction recipients)  Capacity Building Program (Micro-Loan Project) * Target Population - Small business entrepeneuers who wish to borrow money in order to start a small business that is self-supporting and sustainable with loan amounts averaging a little under $400 U.S. and which is repaid over 1-year at 6% interest. This was created so that the recipients would understand that the micro-loan was not a donation or gift but rather that they would need to work on getting the loan paid off so that they could qualify for future loans when they needed it (eg. cacelation of the 'doling out' mentality). Shareholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (micro-loan coordinators) 2) Peace and Equity Foundation (lenders, total is PHP 27,000.00 to be divided as the Aeta tribal councils see fit) 3) Aeta Villagers (the micro-loan recipients, however in order reduce any type of nepotism or corruption, the tribal council agrees to who gets what in regards to the micro-loan such that no one person has complete control of fund distribution)
