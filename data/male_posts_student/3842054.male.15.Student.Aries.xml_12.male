I decide to get up, and i go down to eat ... i guess brunch because it was a peanut butter and jelly bagel ...   So i just screwed around all day waiting for Shaquille O'Neal to become part of the Miami Heat. So he did, and then i went to Katies.. and we went in the pool.  Then i came home and played Basketball... and then i went driving, and it was pretty relaxing for the first time in a while. Then i came home and watched I love the 90's and now im typing.  ANOTHER EXCITING DAY!!!  Well everyone... thankfully tommorow im actually doing something!! some play with brittney,... BUT I GET TO SLEEP OVER MY GRANDPAS! Ill tell you tommorow... alright... im done except the lyrics...  	 Only Wanna Be With You Lyrics Hootie  The Blowfish  You and me We come from different worlds You like to laugh at me When I look at other girls  Sometimes you're crazy And you wonder why I'm such a baby Cause the Dolphins make me cry  Well there's nothing I can do I've been looking for a girl like you  You look at me You've got nothing left to say I'll only pout at you until I get my way I won't dance You won't sing I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring.  Chorus: Well there's nothing I can do I only wanna be with you You can call me your fool Only wanna be with you  Put on a little Dylan sitting on a fence I say that line is great You ask me what I meant by Said I shot a man named Gray Took his wife to Italy She inherited a million bucks And when she died it came to me I can't help it if I'm lucky  Only wanna be with you Ain't Bobby so cool Only wanna be with you  (Solo)  Yeah I'm tangled up and blue Only wanna be with you You can call me your fool Only wanna be with you  Sometimes I wonder If it will ever end You get so mad at me When I go out with my friends Sometimes you're crazy And you wonder why I'm such a baby yeah The Dolphins make me cry  Well there's nothing I can do Only wanna be with you You can call me your fool Only wanna be with you Yeah I'm tangled up in blue Only wanna be with you  Me and daniel had some argument over the meaning of this song... so i had it stuck in my head and i posted it...
