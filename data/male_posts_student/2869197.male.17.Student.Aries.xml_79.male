Maybe it was the constant pain, the heavy weight, or perhaps the rashes that popped up in not so nice places. But it wasn't any of that. It was as appallingly boring as last time. Last Time? Oh, yeah, I tried this before at our property. Failed then too.The reason Iput myself through the pain and misery is to grow closer to God, or so I try. Look, it justmakes sense to me. I try to fast, I try to pray, but I fail.Or did I? The music sounds sweeter, the food is more delicious. I feel a little more driven. I think I'll start those job applications. I better do it quick; this kind of drive runs out all too soon.
