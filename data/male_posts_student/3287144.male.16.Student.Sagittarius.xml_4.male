"Fine" "Good" So went the guilty conversation between a pair of builders who were taking a sneaky break from work and me, the son of their employer who appeared to be bunking off school. Neither of us could blame the other and so the conversation went.  Anyway, I'm not bunking off school as it is still study leave and I've just had the gruelling three hour IT exam, while it is simple it is incessantly dull; the practice exam I had for it back in the winter wasn't so bad as half way through a wasp landed on the next persons computer which provided a quick break of humor but alas, today, nothing.  Prior to meeting the builders [who to be fair, deserve as many breaks as they want] and after the exam, I decided on a visit to town where I purchased a portion of fish and chips, I consumed a good deal of them but left one or two because I wasn't very hungry. Point is I went to put them in a bin and this lovely old woman decided to comment; 'oooh look, he's throwing some of his chips away'. Yes I know I am, and I dare say your friend can see that as well. Why comment?  To be fair I quite like the way old people are very talkative to strangers, they normally talk to me if I am either alone or with a female friend [never if it is me and a male friend or me with several female friends], and usually they only talk about the weather but its still nice just to think that unlike the rest of our society, they can remain happy and content as well as confident to talk to strangers.  Finally while returning home I had the misfortune to be involved in a drive by in which I was 'shot' at by someone with a water gun. This has happened twice now, next time I will be sure to do something - what exactly I will do I am not sure of but who ever it is in that blue car with water guns will regret the day they crossed swords with the Don.
