Hung out with my neighbor for awhile, then someone wanted to look at our house so we had to leave while they were there, I ended up sitting in a car watching my dog for like half an hour. It was good ole' fun. I'm not doing much of anything now, talking to Anais. *shakes a fist* She's crazy. Good thing I lurve crazy. *googly eyes* Bet you weren't expecting that.  Color.  Ouch, that hurts my eyes. Psh, got a great rp going on in Karchan, but I'm not giving out any details yet. You know what they say, No Wheezing the Juice!
