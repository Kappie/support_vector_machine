So here's my (somewhat) expensive Christmas wishlist of what would make me extremely happy.  1. SD cards.  I CAN NOT stress this enough.  Those little storage cards I use in my PDA are like 20 to 40 dollars for a 128 mb card.  With 128 mb I can put 2 albums of songs in my pda, which rules.  Or pictures for my digicam.  Or you can be even better and get a 256 mb one (not Sandisk!) for contiguous storage of large files.  2. AMD Athlon 3000+ Barton socket A CPU with a 333mhz frontside bus speed.  Come on, less than 200 dollars.  I'm asking for this from my parents.  3. A clear Antec case sidepanel.  Less than 30 dollars.  Come ON.  This is perfect.  GO out and order me one.. or buy it, or whatever.  This will definitely make me the happiest for however much it costs.  4. A dvd player.  It doesn't have to be expensive.  Seriously.  I just want to show my dad the magic that is the dvd.  And also have the grip of movies.  I can get my own dvds, don't worry.  5. Hats, gloves, scarfs, winter stuff.  As you may know, I work outside in the morning to 3 pm.  Thats the coldest time of day, pretty much.  Add windchill and hard manual labor and you can imagine how cold I get.  I already got a nice new coat, but the rest would be extremely nice of anyone to get me.  6. Maybe a new scanner?   urlLink Here    Those are pretty cheap flatbed scanners.  7. Cold.  Hard.  Cash.  If you don't want to go out and get me a 60 dollar gift (who would?) just chip me in like 10 to 20 bucks, I won't use it on drugs or anything like that, you can trust me.  I need stuff to spruce up my tech.  Thanks bunches, and if you don't get me anything, don't worry.  I'll be sure to get something for you to make you feel really guilty.  Muahahahah.
