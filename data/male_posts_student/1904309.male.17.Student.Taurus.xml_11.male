This of course means regular updates while I'm here in San Francisco. Gangsta.   Anywho, I'm here in the lap of luxury in the Four Seasons Hotel on Market Street. Very cool. Can't say much more, gotta go grab some lunch. Count on regular posting while I'm here. Also count on sushi, because oh man is sushi big here. Expect sampling. Lots of it. Aight, Dad is hungee, and so am I. Stay tuned.
