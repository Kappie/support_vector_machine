I cried, hid, and said "fuck" about twenty times.  All is well, and I think they are finally crasping it.  I don't know, I just know it's OK, I'm not in trouble.      So I'm hanging with my girlfriend and she just vomits... no joke.  I'm sorry.      I'm going to sleep now, go take a shower and listen to "At Least That's What You Said" cranking full blast.  It'll make you feel alot better.       And, so I don't forget, thank you.  You are incredible, you know why.  I love you, baby.        Good night all you dickheads out there in wonderland... haha, I don't know why, I just think that's funny.  I'm sorry, I suck.      Anyway, keep cool my babies, keep the fluid in you and a wet rag on your forehead.  No, maybe it was just my fault.        I love you all.
