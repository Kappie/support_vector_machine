I have seen three Hollywood movies on the big screen in the last three months. This feat HAS to go in the record books for me! I ain't no movie buff, but looks like times are changing. I think this was my first Johnny Depp movie. Didn't have the slightest of ideas that he was SO good (is he?). Yeah, impressed! The movie has amazing performances and in fact it was much better than I actually expected.  Another week begins, and work beckons (hmm not exactly). Have to make up lost ground on the work front in the last few days. The heat is on full throttle. Lethargy is creeping in. The summer is killing me. It went upto 103 the other day in FoCo, and 108 in Greeley.  Ye re ye re pavsaa...
