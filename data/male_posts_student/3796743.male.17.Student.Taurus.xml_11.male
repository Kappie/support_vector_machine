On Thursday I did some stuff...my sister is back home and we had to go to the high school to drop off a form for the Honors English. So yeah...then since my sister hasn't had any American-ness for three weeks she was dying to spend some of those good ol' Yankee American dollars. So we headed off to the Gap, got sooo much stuff. I did too. It was actually fun. Anyways, later in that day I went to the opening night of Hello Dolly. My best friend Alex was in it, and whole bunches of other people I know. Also, everybody who I know was there, so that was fun. Then I went to Ramblin' Jacks with Alex and everybody after the show and came home late. On Friday, I woke up really late, did nothing for the day and then met my mom and dad so that we could go to Lakefair. Lakefair this year was super dull, like there were the rides and games and all that crap, but for some reason it just didn't seem as much fun. So we were all hungry and we were gonna go eat. But we soon discovered that all the food at Lakefair was served out of like little trailer things and didn't look to be the most sanitary. So my family and I decided that we didn't want to eat out of a trailer so we went to dinner at Red Lobster. It was yummy.  So today, today I woke up late and did some stuff around like clean my room and whatnot. After that we went over to Black Lake where our friend lives. We went out on the boat and went intertubing for like two hours. It was so fun, and I probably got some type of tan. It was awesome, and I had a blast. Too bad the boat ran out of gas so we had to come back in. :( Oh well, then my mom and sister and I went to dinner at Red Robin. It was yummy. My dad is at Lake Tapps with some friends tonight, so its just the three of us tonite. That's all I've got for you folks tointe...till later.
