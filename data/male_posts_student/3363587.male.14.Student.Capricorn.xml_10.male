I realized that I couldn't just 'forget' Her as and when I wished...It'd take time. Now that's the most painful part in this little chapter. I'm making progress, as I know, but I seriously don't know how long it'll take to really go back to how it was before.   On the way home after band...was with CY the language-challenged one and a few others at Bedok Interchange...Something else happened...The most unexpected, as I would say. She and a guy (who shall not be named) walked past, I think She noticed us, but I didn't really pay attention. Yes, He was sending her home. No business of mine. But somehow I started pressing on the bottle in my left hand. After a bit, the bottle was completely crushed under my fingers...Pain? Anger, perhaps? This is getting too much, I think.   It's just that...with my position in *ahem* 'society' right now, it isn't right to carry on like this. I seriously want to get away from this thing, but it will take time. Although I do hope it doesn't take too long...  Band arHz? Fun lah todae...Not really for my section members though...Sectional marching the whole morning till noon. I feel sorry for them frankly...=p Oh come on, I'm not being sarcastic...I'm the caring compassionate type, you know? I was busy writing scores for the sideliners...no choice, Kenrick told me to do it. Mostly marching today, unlike the past few practices (rather enjoyable, those...) So happy that we completed the Firebird formation today...Best Band award is in the bag!! =p =D =O
