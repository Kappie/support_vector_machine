The singer is awesome, and the mix of rock and classical styles just, just, it's awesome.  Listen to them!!!  I know I need to keep my promise and post the review for Max Payne and Half-Life, but I'm having too much fun playing them again to do it yet.  Plus, I'm just lazy.  Oh, I have a new favorite word.  Odd.  Yep, Odd.  That's me.  If I really exist, that is.  Never mind.  Driving is fun.  Very fun.  If you are wondering why I'm acting/typing so weird, it's because I'm in a hurry.  Someone is going to be visiting this site and shaking their head, and I want to throw on some content quick.  Which is turning out to be pretty lame.  So, I'll end here and add some real content tomorrow.  I promise.  Really!
