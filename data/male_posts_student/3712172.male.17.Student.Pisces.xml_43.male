I went out for coffee tonight and had some really good laughs. It felt good to get away from all of the ponderings and thinking I have been possessed by. I guess when I got home it was once again waiting for me. I wrote 3 poems tonight. But, I don't want to overflow this post so I am going to post the one I can relate to mostly in this mood I am in.   What  Immoral acts of shame; Shameful acts of morality; What is truly ethical?  Foreshadowing the distress Commemorating the beauty Brings us to what?  Anticipation to advance, Hesistant to relapse, What lies ahead?  Shuddering to the thought, Intriguing to the mind, What are we up against?  People in agony, Existing within disease What are we here for?  Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk   The poem obviously speaks for itself, I can define it as unanswered questions of life, that perhaps aren't worth pondering; but I can't help to ponder it. Anything unknown intrigues me, which I suppose at times can be a bad thing.  Anyways, life is feeling pretty good at the time, just confusing, love-ridden, and contemplative.  All of my poetry is located in my portfolio (link is at the bottom of the post)  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio    I am going to rest up for my long day tomorrow. Good night all.
