"well there supposed to do it right after you fill out the application" so I'm like oh god.. I look like shit..... so we do the interview and it takes about an hour.. they asked me all these weird quesitons about being a team leader... and such and what was the biggest acomplishment in the last three years for me.. what the hell? what kind of quesiton is that? well I tried to answer them as best as I could... I guess it was going ok until I left.. I made myself look like a complete dumbass!! I hate myself for it.. well when I walking out the door I said "it was nice to meet you.. my name it Taylor" and pointed to myself (although I dont think she saw me point, thank god!!) but I mean what the FUCK was I thinking!!??? I so hope that doesnt ruin my chances for getting a job there... I really really really really really really need a job, and working there would be so cool... beacuse in a way I've always wanted to work there....  well anyway we came back to my house.. I told him that he could come in if he wanted to but I had to clean my room.. so he would be just sitting there.. and thats what he did... he just sat there and kind of looked over at me every once in a while.. which was kind of irritating.... but I tried to ignore it... so I finally got done cleaning my room like 20 mintues ago.. its so clean, I even cleaned out my dresser, and found a hole bunch of stuff that I had been missing.... its funny when you clean something you actually find stuff you've been missing! how about that! :P well I guess I'm going to go for now.. theres nothing really to talk about.... my mom gets off right now... I hope she lets me use the car.. because I'm sooo hungry.. I havent eaten all day.. plus I would kill for a diet pepsi!! well... not kill... :P but anyway... I'll probably go bye the shaved ice stand and see Julie.... keep her company... blog ya later  nyny
