I didn't talk to Cassie at all even though I really wanted to, and when I finally sat down beside her it was time to go. When I did say "Hi" to her I happened to "squeak" -I guess you'd call it- which didn't make me feel to happy. She laughed at it which I guess she thought it was funny, but I didn't. Yeah sure it's normal, but still, not the happy thing. To say it was funny might be an under statement depending on who you are.  Now, back to today. I don't feel good today, today is going by really slow and having a book that i haven't gotten into yet isn't helping it. If you ever hear a book is bad and boring you know it's true because I'll read almost anything you give me, no matter how long and hard it is. Even if it bores the heck out of me. Back to Cassie, there's this girl that "used" to like me but we still believe that she likes me now. I'd like to say that she actually tries to keep me away from Cassie and keep Cassie away from me.   It seems like everytime I turn around and finally get a chance to talk to Cassie she pops up and tries to talk to me. And she won't move over a seat so Cassie can sit next to me, but she will move over if it's somebody else that's going to sit next to her or me. Not a lot of evidence; no, but it gets on my nerves how she keeps popping up. I think I'm going to kill her if she does it again.   It's not that it's irritating, I mean yeah it is, but it takes everything I've got to calm myself down and finally approach the girl (Cassie) and talk to her. If ya don't think I'm going to be happy when she pops up and distracts me then you are right. (Score one for you!) I am mad. I don't know what I'll do if she does it again. Lik eI said I might kill her. Well, this post is getting long, I might wanna stop now. Maybe I'll right more tommorow.    And pleeeeeaaaaaasee, if you are reading this at least write  something  as a comment. Even if it's just "hi" or "i hope everything works out", maybe even "i'd kill her too", but I've gotten not one single comment at all in this whole blog that hasn't been from  urlLink tBLOG  that I've posted so you'll know what they wrote.
