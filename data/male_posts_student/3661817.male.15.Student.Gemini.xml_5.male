Today was good, woke up early, and sadly my cable was out and so was my phones (since we have phoens that run through my cable interenet blah blah blah). So me and my dad went out and ate breakfast at good ol Mohegan Diner. Fro mthere we went to go get my bike. yes! i waited for it for so long, and its a good ride, i dont know BMX tricks, i jsut use bikes to get from point a to point b.   Then dane called me when i got home, and i packed my stuff and my dad drove me there. We went swimming, and then we went to subway.  my friend vinny works there. we went to bust his chops on his second day. Sadly he didnt serve us. Then i aske dhim for an application, because i really do need a job.   yeah, then we came back to danes, and have been hangin out.  O susie....sorry for not answering your questions online. I was typing this, and Danes computer is muted, so i didnt knwo if you were IMing me. SOrry about that.  Until Next Time.
