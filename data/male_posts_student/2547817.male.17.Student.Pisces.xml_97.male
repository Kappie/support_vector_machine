Watched Shrek 2 today with Ken. Only got one good laugh out of it. I have come to 2 conclusions which attempt to explain why I wasn't really humored. 1) It's all the damn trailers which let everything out. 2) It's coz I've got so many burdens, that nothing really humors me anymore.  Went to the top of the multi-story carpark. We had time there and it will be within me for a long time to come. Passion when I was broken. Sounds profound? Na-ah. Prayed on the concrete road beneath the stars that I may be shown the way to go in my life and that He would guide me in my ways. Also that he would handle the situation with Zel as he pleases, but that didn't stop me from making my requests with regards to the matter.  Tomorrow = drama auditions = nervous. But will wing it. Wish me luck.  I've realized that I'm behaving like an ordinary teenager, falling in love, madly and irrationally. Unacceptable.
