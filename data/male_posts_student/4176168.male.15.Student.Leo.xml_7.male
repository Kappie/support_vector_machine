I finally got everything done for my handbook...other than the cover page of corse...I was able to go over it many times today and fix up anything that may be wrong with it and found some more pictures on Google to use as background Pictures...so I basically have everything done. Now regarding the Cover...I've decided to take a really crazy/Nice Idea picture this coming friday and slap it on as the cover...we've done it many time before...I don't see why it wouldn't work now...the only problem - I need to think of that crazy/nice idea...well...got another 24 hours...times to dig up my brain and loss some sleep again...  I finally got to watch the Naruto special that I have beening waiting this week...what can I say?...1 hour of pure fun and excitment...I love Naruto, and what is even better?...the naruto site me and my friend have been working on...  had a review...a rather good one on that note...and we are quite happy about it, if you got the love for Naruto, check out our site's review at: http://kyubinetwork.com/index.php?id=sitereviews/nspot/index.htm ... a bit of traffic wouldn't hurt...:D  Anyways...today I have relased that my father is coming back to Canada this week...he have been away on a project in China for many month now...and he's finally coming back!...too bad he's leaving again in a month but...I'll just enjoy the time for now...we have a lot of planned made, we were thinking of going to Disney World this summer, really looking forward to it...
