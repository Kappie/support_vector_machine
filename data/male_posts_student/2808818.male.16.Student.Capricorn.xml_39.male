This is something that did make me laugh on the radio today though, aparantly, he has a website about him being a ref ect., but it had to be shut down today because it receved over 20,000 hits in one minute from england fans getting his email address (yes, it was on there), so thats cheered me up a teeny bit...and i have his email addy to :D but he prolly deleted it now :(  bye.  - Adrian
