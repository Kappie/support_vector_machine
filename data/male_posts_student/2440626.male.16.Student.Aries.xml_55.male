It was fun.  Anyway, in something completely unrealated, I am considering applying for the part-time counter person position at Judy Jean's Bakery.  I mean, I understand that isn't exactly the most  thrilling  job out there; but it is something.  Another thing is, if you haven't tried those new Ritz Chips, try them.  They are really good and half the fat of potato chips.  In other news, Gavin DeGraw is performing in Pittsburgh on July 24th.  And, well, I am pretty excited.  The plan is me, Chapman, and Britt Zack, will go down.  But I am not too sure how that will work out.  I really hope it does though.  Well I start summer gym on Wednesday morning, and I need to get back into waking-up-early-mode, so my mother wants me in bed by midnight.  More to come soon.  Signing off...
