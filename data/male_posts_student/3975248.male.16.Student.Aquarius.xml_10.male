And speaking of the PGA, I will not be updating my blog at all next week because of my busy schedule. I've gotta work 5 days out of the week and the other two I'll be taking care of oneighty projects with Mr. Houk since we'll be having oneighty practice the following week at the new building. I'll be back the following week so keep checkin' it out! Have an excellent week.
