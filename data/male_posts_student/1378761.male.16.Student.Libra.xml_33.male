Alyssa drove to lunch. We went to Tasty Treat for a change. Dam they are expensive. After that we went over to Joshes house.  We checked on him. He said he was'ent feeling good but he looked ok.  What do ya expect? During geometry today Hannah Hobler leaned over and said "Eric, my desk is sticky". As she leaned over the other way I seen strands of gum attaching her butt to the desk. I just had to laugh. It was the funnist thing I had seen in a while. What really made it funny was that she was picking the gum off her ass the whole period. It was just funny than hell. I guess she is lucky that we sit towards the back. It would have been really embaressing if she was up front. But we had to laugh about it all day. So that was pretty much the highlight of my day. Alyssa ened up bringing me home after school, I guess she is becoming my person transporter. Well the good news is that my step-dad fixed the car. He put new hinges on the door and sprayed some touch up paint. I can't drive it tommarow because of the paint, but it will be done soon!! And the over thing is that I got out of work right at 8!! Ise'nt that great!!  Happy as ever, Eric
