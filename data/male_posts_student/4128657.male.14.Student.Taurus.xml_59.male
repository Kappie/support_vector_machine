This summer we are living with very hard water and I have quite a few shirts and blouses that I don't put in the dryer. The linen and knit shirts tend to be very wrinkled. I spray the item well when I turn the iron on to heat and come back in 5 minutes to iron and it is a pleasure!!! The shirts seem to not wrinkle as easy during wear also. This is quite a time saver!!! It also has a pleasant fresh air smell and doesn't stiffen the fabric like starch does.
