I did a practice test earlier this morning, and got a middle B, which isn't that bad, but it isn't really very good either. But those practice ones are rather hard. And they don't give you any slack in the mark scheme. In the actual exams, there is a little 'accept this..' section for the anweres, making them slightly easier. Anyway, bio wasn't too bad, so this shouldn't be too hard either. I'll probably do another test later today and another tomorrow. Or maybe two tomorrow. I need to get them both done though.  Now I come to think of it, what else have I actually done today. Revision and... oh yes, reading Harry Potter. Still 40 pages left to read today. So I haven't had a very interesting day. Doesn't time fly when you're having fun? Still, chemistry and English to look forward to on Monday. That will be comparing poems from other cultures, which aren't too difficult, but terribly boring. We have notes in the anthology though.  I have also added to my signature thing. Well, why not?  Well, best be off, bye for now.
