Tonight was the first orchestra rehearsal I've been to, and apparently the band is quite greatful for having me there. Yeah, orchestra has some cool things about it. I have some friends there, and the two things I love most: music, and Amanda. I had to "audition" today, which is odd since I'm the only percussionist around...  Let's see...recap: Math: eh...I'll work through whatever crap I've got tonight Science: woot-loads of labs Band: Same old, rehearsal for the concert coming up fairly soon. Spanish: Today, we have two-YES TWO-Random Spanish Funzies of the day. 1. During role call, Matt smoothly replaces "present" with "penis". This is right before lunch, so the whole class walks out laughing our heads off. Damn, Matt is too good at that. 2. Today was "Pi" day, you know, 3.14...anyway: We had pie at lunch, prompting Matt to excuse himself from the class after lunch, claiming he had "food poisoning". About 2 minutes later, Sam's cell phone rings in the classroom. Sustic never realizes that it was Matt calling from the bathroom...  English: GAAAA!!!!! I hate english!  Social: Presentations, and more presentations. that's all  That pretty much sums up the day, and now I've got some homework, and practicing the two instruments I play best...lol. Plus I'm getting tired, which implies that I need sleep. And talking about being tired gets me even more sleepy. uh oh. I gotta run  I'll leave you all with yet another lyric, this one by Michelle Branch.  "When you're all alone, and you need a light, someone to guide you through the night, just remember that I am here, to hold you close and dry your tears.   Oh-ooh   And just when you thought you were falling, but you know I'll always be right there.   When you're all alone, and you need a friend, someone to help you to the end, when you need someone to catch you when you fall, I'll be there through it all.   oh-oh   Cause just when you thought you were losing, but you know I'll always be right there.   And I'll be there through the good times, and the bad, and we'll be there for each other, cause you're the best friend I've ever had.   And just when you thought you were falling, but you know I'll always be right there. oh-oooh whenever you need me, I'll always be right there."
