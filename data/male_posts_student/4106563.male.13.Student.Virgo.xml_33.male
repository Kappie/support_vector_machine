From Michael Keaton to (damn it, I forgot his name) to George Clooney to Christian Bate (who the hell is his he?). The sixth Batman movie (or fifth, I don't pay attention) is called Batman Begins or something with Batman and begins in it.  I adored Batman (I still do) I don't want Batman to be crushed with too many movies. I remember my Nana putting a tape of the old Batman TV series. Damn, those were good times. Anywho, I think you should just stick with comics and the tapings of the old Batman TV series.
