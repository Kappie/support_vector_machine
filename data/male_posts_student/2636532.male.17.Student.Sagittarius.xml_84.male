NO! does wearing a stormtrooper outfit help you see the picture better? NO! Does wearing the princess Leia golden Bikini make the movie more enjoyable...well...ok...seeing some hot person wearing it does...but other then that there's no reason to do it. "Weeeeeee! lets dress up and spend however many hours getting ready to go sit in the dark watching a movie where no one will notice anything we took time to make other then to laugh and make fun of us and then go home after the movie is done and take it off." yep there's a point alright. Idiots! -Matt P.S. Natty will kill me for this one
