Compared to BASIC, C++ is more powerful and compared to a 266 MHz computer, a 2.66 GHz computer is more powerful. Today, I say: PHP is not simply powerful, PHP is Power (with a capital P that is).  Mukul used to talk about PHP a lot, how he loved programming in PHP and how it was so generally fantastic. I never really understood. After all, I said to myself, it's a programming language... what can be so great about a programming language? Today I found out. PHP is the most flexible language I have ever seen (I have not seen much, but still). 'Flexible' is just the right word, because you will find the same power in C++ as well. Of course then C++ is not used as a Server Side Scripting language, so you can't make a fair comparison. I won't explain here how it's flexible because that's what the Session@Exun was about.  Mukul was disappointed that he did not get much done, and didn't really go into the 'good stuff', but we all (me and some friends) expected this, especially because not everyone there knew C++ (which would have meant easily skipping about half the topics we went through). The small gathering was an enthusiastic one, many doubts were asked and all were answered. It could be easily seen that everyone thoroughly enjoyed the Session as a) no one wanted to leave and b) those who had to leave 20 minutes early begged to stop the class and continue it some other time.  If Mukul finds free time next week, we can arrange a second Session in which perhaps we can apply some of the power of PHP. However, if there is to be a next Session, Mukul has advised that everyone should know about PHP syntax, so that that does not have to be explained [again]. If there is another Session, information will be posted on this blog.  --Karan
