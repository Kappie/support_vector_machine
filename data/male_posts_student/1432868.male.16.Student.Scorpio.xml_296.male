Plastic bags, cigarette butts, tangled lines, plastic bits, and even driftwood (with rusty nails included). It is unbelievable how far people will allow this dumping to go. DOES ANYONE CARE?! Does anyone worry about how they are ruining the beach for themselves, the animals, and others. Does anyone care that this earth must support us for years and years to come? Do they even consider what their trash is doing?   In part I blame the major push for recycling in this country. I think it gives a false sense of us helping the environment. Yes, recycling is good, but it pales in it's effectiveness next to conservation and reuse. Instead of throwing away the empty water bottle why don't people just go use it again? Their is so much people can do that will benefit everyone. Instead everyone feels that if they "recycle" they can be more liberal with the conservation and reuse without guilt because, they recycle. Although recycling is a good thing, it is far from a effective solution.   The only effective solution is to make people care. Make the boaters care and make the beach-goers care. I only hope it is not too late for us to reverse this saddening trend.
