Will the whiley ways of Ms. Tanya Ferguson corrupt the ever so strong will of Mr. Kovach?  Or will a dark horse come in from the flank and win over the "heart" of Gerrit?  Only time will tell.  2.) Will Al consume every last drop of Jack Daniels that he can find?  All signs are pointing to yes, an emphatic yes.  Will Al be arrested for public drunkeness in Huntington Beach?  Will Al propose to Kevin?  Will Al drink away ALL of his money this summer, or will he actually have enough to move out by year's end?  3.)  Will Edgar return the oh-so-enticing restaurant business?  Will the professor lower himself enough to return to, say, Coco's Bakery Restaurant?  Edgar, i'm sure Farzana, Manny and Mike would love to have you back, selling food items that we don't have.  Remember the fun of going back to a table four times on the same visit to tell them we were out of stuff?  Remember that......oh the memories.   ***More questions to come.......*****
