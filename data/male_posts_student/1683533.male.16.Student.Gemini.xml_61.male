Then me, my mom, Rachel, mrs. peters, Larry, mike, and brandon played Uno.  Then we played Trivial Pursuit and me and Mrs. Peters won! *laughs* good times...good times....oh yea and being the klutz that I am...I managed to break a  plastic  cup (it cracked ok...) then I knocked over a little statue of some naked guy, and broke his head off....that was not cool...but still funny......  I quit marching band...my dad said it was ok if I got a job and started takin guitar lessons again....he just doesnt want me layin around the house all day...but thats ok...cause i wanted to do that stuff anyways....my mom says that the marching band only has one trombone player now...oh well...not my problems....why did I quit?  I got sick of it...not worth all the trouble...lost the fun that it once had...  Finished painting today!...this is the last night I am gonna sleep on the couch...woohoo!....thats uncomfortable......all that is left is rearranging my furniture in my room...and puttin on the new bedspread...well thats all thats been happenin...fuck....school is only 3 weeks away!!!!!!!! THE END IS NEAR!!!!  "Fuck the kids!" -NOFX
