Discovered the meaning of 'Peice of Shit'. They were all refering to this mutt dog that my sister has staying here. She is here for maybe an hour during the day and then at night, -sometimes-. I am always having to take this dog out side and I cannot stand it because the dog has no cordination what so ever, it also could possibly the only creature with negitive IQ standings. If you cannot tell by now that I -really- don't like this dog then you might have problems. But I'll go on with the story of why I cannot stand this dog. Yesterday, around 3:30ish I took out the mutt to go to the bathroom, pea, poop, whatever. Well he goes and peas, ok... Runs back onto the deck in back to the door like it wants to go back in so yea, great, lets go back in cause I really don't like having to take you out dog. We go in, I come back up, talk to some friends, and then go down stairs for a snack and back up again. I go down to make sure all the stuff is taken care of downstairs and I smell something, so I look around, AND THE DAMN DOG TOOK A SHIT ON THE CARPET! NOT EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT EITHER!!! NOOO!!! COULDN'T BE SMALL... It was like the runs with a little firmness... it was so wrong... Ok, what is worse, I have to pick up this mutts crap... So I go find some latex gloves, two full rolls of paper towel, a pitcher of water, and a trash bag... I'll skip that part though. Just so you know, I hate the mutt.  Oks.... onto today.... No more mutt stories, thank the Lord!! Today I have been trying to get it to where you can pick your own text colour for this blog but it isn't working yet, the java is kinda screwy so I'm working on it still. On to the 'suprise'. Other than the fact that I work tonight, from 8-10.... I am adding another blog to my blogs!!! A Dream Log Blog! Hehe. I invite you to go look there, the link should appear in the right hand side with my other blog and the Blogs that I like section. Go take a look, I'll have it up soon I am hoping.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.
