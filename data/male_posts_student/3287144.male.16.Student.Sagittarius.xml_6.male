I think it was destined to go badly, there were a number of clues but I didn't see them until now. I had another dream last night, I can't remember it exactly but it went a little like this; I am attending a posh dinner and I go wearing a tuxedo, someone I used to date is also attending and I remember how I still love her. She still hates me. I shrug it off; she never liked me and so nothing changes. In other news I have started re-reading all of Sherlock Holmes books, they are truly magnificent. Sign of Four this evening, brilliant. In other news I'm listening to the Cuban Overture as composed by George Gershwin, my brother tried to sell it to me as jazz but its quite simply, not the standard style of jazz. But its still good. To be honest I'm quite envious of any classical composer, it would be such a marvelous skill to be a good classical composer, despite lacking in the same recognition as their pop counterparts. Play on!  Music: George Gershwin - Cuban Overture Mood: Not all that bad despite being a failure. Site:  urlLink http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/gershwin.html
