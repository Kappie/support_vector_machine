Two out of three ain't bad.  It's a week away from my birthday today and I hope I'll be doing something.  I suppose I could go to Chuck"E"cheese!  Nobody is too old for that place.  Who knew cheap toys were so sought after!?  Or perhaps I could just stay home and do nothing what so ever or something in between.  I dunno what I want...perhaps an Ipod mini or an upgrade on my laptop's graphics card.  Can't go wrong with either I suppose.  DVDs are always good as well.  Recently I've found an awesome game.  Perhaps you've played it.  Scrabble!  I really like that game.  If you haven't played it and like word games you might wanna give it a shot.  Our neighborhood plays it a lot so it's pretty cool to get together and play a game of scrabble.  Well I suppose that's all I've got to say, I'm out.
