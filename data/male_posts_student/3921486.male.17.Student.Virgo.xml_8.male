How is it possible to be with with them when they don't want to be with you.  How is it possible to love them when they don't love you.    Because you knowyou can't live with out them.  Because you knowyou want to talk to them.  Because you knowyou want to be with them.  Because you knowyou love them.    "when you truly love someone, you must let them go" quote from my sassy girl movie.        "poem i wrote" inspiredfrom a movie that i saw.
