Our current conversation is about chocolate whipped cream. We're amusing ourselves.  Life is good. That's all I can say. I don't know why. It might be because I finally beat the spider boss in Megaman X; I've been trying to beat him since i was 5. It might also be the fact The Warped Tour is tomorrow. Speaking of that, I should probably call Katie and Jason and tell them when we're leaving. People like to be told when we're going, right? Damn peoples.  I just called Bobby. He's tired. Poor guy; he has such a hard life. Today he just screwed around and saw Spiderman 2. "The best movie ever" in his words. Bobby gets obsessed with stuff randomly. I mean, sure it was a good movie, but not "The best movie ever."  I'm about to go downstairs and grab something to munch on. Maybe I'll finally get to my wedding crashing scene for Red Dress. I think I'm going to cut the mental institution theme.   -Dan
