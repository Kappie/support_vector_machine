You are a hard but fair teacher with high expectations and impeccable morals. You wear your hair in a tight bun and indeed, never deviate from what is proper. However, you care deeply about the students and have great house pride. You are responsible, reliable, and trustworthy. -art by Tealin-    urlLink   What long-time Hogwarts staff member are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
