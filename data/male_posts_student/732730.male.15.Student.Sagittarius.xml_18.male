He says he loves me, but if he loves me WHY THE FUCK IS HE QUESTIONING HIS SEXUALITY. I'm going down there in just under two weeks, and he decides to change his mind days before I see him for the first time? Not happy, Jan!  So yer. I have a new layout on the way... It's really basic, because I'm not in the mood for a comples layout. I'm lazy.
