Well Jing Chung's team won Chong Beng's team. There are four teams in the semifinals, they are - Zhen Xing, LA 6ers, Councilor Unit and Revenge. I think the team that will win the champion, will be Revenge. However, they will not be at their full power as their four school team members, are banned from the games. As the rules stated, one team can only have 2 school team members or so. Well Zhen Xing claimed that they were not at their peek performance before semifinals, let us wait and see what Ming Chew will do on his team. LA 6ers, which plays dirty strategies, will have trouble. Councilor Unit will have a great chance as there are many ex- school team members, like Soo Thing, Heng Wei and Ge Ren. Well may the best win.
