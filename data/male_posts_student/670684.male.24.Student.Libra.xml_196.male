Abraham Lincoln once jumped out of a judicial house window in order to miss a vote; this is just as good, and for just as good of reasons; in no way should Austin's congressional district stretch 200 miles to near Del Rio.  Tom Craddick says that the redistricting would allow Texans their true voice.  Well, considering how Republicans bitch-slapped the Democrats in November, it would stand to reason that, for him, Texans have their voice.  And for us liberals in Austin, we're glad we are districted so we can vote someone in who is interested in our voice.  We don't mind losing votes to the rest of Texas; we do mind losing our voice in Congress.    Patrick Rose, a friend of a friend who is somewhat of an inspiration to my Spring 2004 screenplay (I think that far ahead in this program), looks like he  urlLink won't be heralded  for his move.     Sorry that this is coming from the Austin-American Statesman, a paper I don't hold in great esteem.  The Austin Chronicle doesn't come out until Thursday, but I'm sure its content on this issue will be much richer.
