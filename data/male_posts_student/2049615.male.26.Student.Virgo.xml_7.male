It also got to be about five single-spaced pages long.  I have elected instead to present a few highlights:    My friend Kevin and I bum a cigarette to a normal-looking girl outside of Dunkin' Donuts.  Instead of going away, she follows us to a bar.   After telling us we both look gay, she announces her intention to get men to buy her free drinks all night by showing as much of her breasts as the law allows as often as possible.  Only after this do we find out her name is Amy.   She keeps trying to pocket lighters and pens from everyone all night, and bums an estimated total of 35 cigarettes from four people.  I couldn't really keep score on the drinks, but she did seem to be getting drunker without getting noticeably poorer for the duration of the night.   She keeps challenging me to games of Galaga, which I win handily.  It doesn't matter because she invariably loses interest and wanders off after her first ship dies.   As soon as my friend Anders arrives, she gloms on to him and manages to con him out of at least one drink before she goes up to the bar for a minute and we're able to explain to him that we have no idea who the hell she is, but she's nuts and that in retrospect, giving her our real names was probably not wise.   She draws a preschool-caliber marker picture, purportedly a unicorn, on Anders's back.   Before she leaves she gives Anders her email address.  I suggest to Anders's friend Erica that she pass it to some poor slob over by the bar.  She declines.    The overarching life lessons to be learned are these:   Don't go to Dunkin' Donuts.   When you challenge someone to Galaga, go first.   Don't expect to find great art anywhere on Anders except his right shoulder.   Erica needs to start being crueler to strangers.   Fortunately for me I live in Bloomington and I can't go back to Chicago for at least another three weeks (Yay papers.  Yay Jason Spaceman).  My doomed companions, however, are there, in Chicago, with Her, where she roams around, sure to meet with them again.  It's only a matter of time.  I only hope she's not on Friendster.
