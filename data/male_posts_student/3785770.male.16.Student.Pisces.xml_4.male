New in this version:     - Support for auditing UNIX passwords  - Remote hash retrieval  - Password audits can be scheduled to run automatically  - Remediation of weak passwords (force users to reset passwords)  - Support for auditing international passwords and character sets   - Pre-computed password tables for rapid recovery  - Password "scoring" to provide quick reviews of password strength   - Graphic reporting of passwords, including method used for cracking.      I've seen all different types of Windows password cracking tools, some freeware, others shareware and trial ware. Even though L0phtCrack isn't free (for most people), I still find it the fastest and easiest to use.     >>  urlLink Download Trial
