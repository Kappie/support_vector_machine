It means that everything that happens is the best thing to happen in the situation   or it means that everything is all good and there are no problems.  Now it may not seem like it is the best thing to happen at the time   but in time everything reveals itself and everything eventually works out.  Now there is no telling when it will show it self but a person must be patient.  Unfortunately that is one thing that I am usually not.  I mean I usually want things to happen now and not have to wait.  Like I want the school year to end now.  And I want a girlfriend now   but unfortunately neither of those things are gone happen anytime soon  >>
