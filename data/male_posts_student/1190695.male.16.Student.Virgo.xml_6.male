Anyway, it's been nearly a month since I last posted here. And unfortunately, due to the current unsteady nature of my extremities, I'll have to cut this one short. Perhaps I'll be back tomorrow, after a good night's sleep.   I'm off to watch the Euro 2004 final that my father conveniently taped for me. I'll leave you with this thought-provoking quote:  "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones." -Albert Einstein  Tot volgende tijd!
