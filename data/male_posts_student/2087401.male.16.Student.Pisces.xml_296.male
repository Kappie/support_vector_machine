My parents asked me what the difference between the Golden Globes and the Oscars were, the main differences being these: The Golden Globes are held in a Hotel Ballroom, usually the Beverly Hilton and the Oscars are held in a theatre, usuallyThe Shrine Auditorium near USC, The Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, or the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles Music Center, Downtown (I suppose the new Gehry designed Walt Disney Music Hall is a possibility, unless the Philharmonic Orchestra are performing)  This tangent has been brought to you by NBC, the only place to see the 2004 hooker-infested Olympic Games in Athens and Drunken Celebrities at the Golden Globes.   Also the fact that the nominees and attendees sit at tables, rather than in a big theatre. Also they drink heavily.   There was really no point in me writing this entry except to say that I know a lot about the Golden Globes and Los Angeles, and you don't.  Also Erin, Nathan told me he lost your book.   Oy, With the Fishcakes Already!  (The template thing should be italicized, as not to drag attention away from the entry)
