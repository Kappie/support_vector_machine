Megan is behind me and starts to read the back of my shirt, which says "It's not how big you are, it's how big you THINK you are" and kyle thought megan was just randomly saying it, and he got all excited and was like "Really!?" Hmmmmm...maybe someone should compensate his small penis for a jeep with very large tires, or a hummer with a lift.
