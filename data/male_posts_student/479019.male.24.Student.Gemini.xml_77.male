I think it looks a lot better now. I also started my Skakespeare's Birthplace painting. I got to use my new wash brush I purchased yesterday. It's so nice to paint with a new brush... I'd forgot how easy it is to do straight smooth lines! It's really my fault my old brushes suck though... I'm not exactly the most thorough of cleaners. That's why I didn't buy a good brush. I bought a cheapo brush. Maybe if I was richer I would get better ones... then again if I was richer... I'd buy better paints... oil painting is an expensive hobby!  I could really use a beer today... perhaps I'll call up the buds and have some with RAW.  ****
