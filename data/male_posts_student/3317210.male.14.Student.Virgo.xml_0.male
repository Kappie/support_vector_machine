Unless they've been on here since the beginning of Blogger, these people may have some worrying lives. I'm a nerd, first and foremost, I'll be first to admit, yet even I have a limit, and personally, a blog is merely to keep a log of what you are doing day by day in your life, like a digital diary of sorts, not something amazingly important!  Though, I admit, some others may use it for book ideas, or something extremely heavy like that, theres got to be some limit. You cannot spend your life talking about the world if you have not been out there and seen it!  I do enjoy writing this, merely as I know I myself will end up re-reading this in the future, and I have a very high regard for recording the journey of my life for myself later, as if you don't, it seems that your life has been washed away, which is certainly not the case. If ever you get depressed, stop for a moment to look how far you have come, and through what fields you have fought.  Anyway, good night for the last time, I still have to do homework and if my parents catch me, *eek*  Fare the well! =P
