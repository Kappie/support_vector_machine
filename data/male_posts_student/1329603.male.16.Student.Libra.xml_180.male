Anyhow, Scott's back, and we give him a big welcome for being so. Because he's back and no longer in France. And he got me "Die Welt" - the German newspaper ^_^. Thanks trés viel, Scott. Oh, and he got Les Misérables, the current French edition of... c'est trés cool, and they put a version of Empty Chairs into it yay.  Oddly enough I texted Becky and Laura this morning, for the sole reason of saying "good morning". I like the ability to say good morning to people. 'Tis fun. Haven't talked to Laura for a couple of days. Sure, it's irritating for me, but still, I'm not dying yet. Maybe after another few days :p.  I've been practicing the 2 Bourrées from Bach's Cello Suites as arranged for trombone, and that's kinda mad... they're really, really... just odd, really. Fast, weird intervals, weird slide positions... mad. They're nice enough to hear but to play they're a bit of a git.  I'm in anticipation of something I don't know again, I guess. Oh well, anticipation/fear isn't the worst feeling ever. It contends but it's not quite the worst.  Quote of the day: "Da da da, Dum da da, Da diddly da da da."  From Bach's   Bourrée No.1   Love, Jon Roskilly
