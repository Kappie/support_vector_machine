Thanks to friends who cared, I was already feeling much better that very night when I had that fever. Fever had gone down to 37.3˚C, when I woke up after a totally long nap. Nothing much had happened over the weekends, except for pissing Nova off. I kind of accidentally hinted her secret to her friends, and she was so very furious when that friend of hers called asking. Feeling bad, hope she accepts my apologies.   As for Sunday. Tara came back online after shuai ge fixed the problem. It was a in reality a good news for her sister too, not only did she had excess to the net, she also had peace once Tara is back to surfing the web. HEhhee…. Cute sisters.   Monday, which was yesterday. I rushed out recca’s eight dragons sketch only to find out I got myself the wrong drawing to refer to. Oh well, it was still the fastest full page sketch I’ve ever did, and also my second completed full page sketch. And since it was a full page sketch, I had to find a nice empty spot to sign. TADA~! sideway signature. Hahaha.. that’s the only way I can squeeze in my signature.
