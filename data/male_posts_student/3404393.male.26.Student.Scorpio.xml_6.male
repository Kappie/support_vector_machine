They think our prescense in Iraq is wrong, or they don't want anymore US soldiers killed, or they may think that our government isn't really concerned with the war on terror so much as other things.  But what about the people who this affects the most? The soldiers fighting the war, and the people of Iraq?   The soldiers almost unanimously agree that being there is the right thing to do. If that is what they believe, that is good enough for me. They are the ones doing the dirty work, risking injury or death and all in the name of protecting and preserving the rights and freedoms that we enjoy and usually take for granted. By protesting our armed forces presence in Iraq, we undermine their efforts. We need to Unify and support them and not erode the very foundation beneath them.  How about the Iraqi people? Well, I wish I could ask them - because the Media is doing a really crappy job of informing us about them and what they think, the really important stuff. Not the blood and violence, not the "if it bleeds, it leads", not all the conjecture and allegations and accusations that have no proof.  To all you media moguls, don't tell us what you think is important. Just tell us what's going on and we'll decide if it's important or not. If I want to be entertained I'll go to the movies or watch a sitcom.  Jonathan
