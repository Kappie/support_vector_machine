But I have.  I don't know.  I drove to the King O' Prussia mall at about 9:30 AM.  I waited a bit.  And I saw Matt there so I got out of my car and walked to him.  We had planned to do something before we finally were set to go to his house.  He called his mom and said that I was going to be late.  So we had thirty minutes to ourselves.  Which was awesome.  We drove to the top of the parking lot thing and parked in a corner hopefully away from everyone.  And just kissed.  It felt so good.  And his hands felt so good.  After that, we drove to his house.  It was a half an hour ride.  Through the country.  Which looked really nice.  I liked it.  I got really disoriented because of all the turns.  But his neighborhood is nice.  Nice big houses.  Peaceful.  Quiet.  Good place for a family.  His house is nice too.  Nice pool.  His parents weren't that bad.  They weren't that scary once the introductions were over.  His sister was cool too.  It was very normal.  And I like that.  We played some DDR.  This would be my second time.  And I totally suck.  But Matt's really good.  Really really good.  And it was funny/awesome to watch him play and jump.  I'm just clumsy.  But I guess if I had more practice, I could get better.  For lunch, I had some stuff from the local take-out place.  BBQ stuff.  Which was awesome.  Afterwards, we played some video games.  That was fun for a while.  Then we went down and went swimming.  That was also fun for a while.  Then we went upstairs again.  And watched three good funny episodes of the Simpsons.  That was fun.  We kept sneaking ticklings between us.  And random holding of hands.  But nothing really too serious since his family was still there.  But it was fun.  And I liked it anyway.  And then it was time to go.  Which I didn't like.  But I guess good times had to end sometime.  We drove to the mall again.  And we decided to give the whole thing another try.  So we went up to the top floor of the parking lot again and parked somewhere where people wouldn't notice.  And he put the sun shades up.  And then we went into the back seat.  It was way too small and cramped.  So we both couldn't stimulate each other at the same time.  So I decided to stimulate him first.  I reached down into his pants while he was on the bottom and I was on top.  I don't want to sound shallow, but his penis was really big.  I wasn't really surprised as much as I was happy.  So I had an idea.  I asked him if he felt comfortable if I gave him a blow job.  And he agreed.    It was so nerve wrecking.  I didn't know what to do, exactly.  I took his penis and went for the head.  And as I grew more and more comfortable, I pushed deeper and deeper in.  He tasted really good.  And I could taste his precum.  Lots of it.  I deepthroated him the best I could since it was my first time and all.  And I guess he liked that a lot.  His hands touched me all over and that felt good.  And I felt that he liked it.  Pretty soon, he was close.  And then, he blew.  Inside my mouth.  And it was so good.  Tasted awesome.  I still had some in my mouth so I came up and kissed him.  Sigh.  Good.  But it was my turn.  And I guess I had inhibitions and stuff when my time came.  He was so gentle.  He took mine into his mouth.  Up and down.  And it felt so good.  But at the same time, it was weird.  I guess he pulled my foreskin too far back.  And my head is really sensitive.  So thats why it felt weird.  And maybe the location was weird.  And it made me feel weird.  Doing it in the car.  I guess I'm not a car person.  So I told him to stop and I told him to just give me a hand job.  Which I was fine with.  And I got really close a couple of times.  But he just went to fast.  Which I didn't like that much.  And it washed away the goodness.  Maybe if we do it next time, I'll give him better tips on how to get me off.  But in the end, I didn't cum.  At all.  He said I had some precum.  Which is a good sign since I would have to be really really horny to get precum.    I told him to write me an e-mail while he was away.  Well, I sorta "talked" to him, having a one way conversation since he was away and all.  Passed out, it seems.  Anyway, I just told him that it wasn't his fault.  It was probably my fault.  It was probably the location.  Or something.  I still felt bad about it.  But I didn't want him to feel bad at about it.  I'm still kinda jealous that he got to cum and I didn't.  But I guess, oh well.  In the e-mail, he echoed what I said in the one way conversation.  I said that I had a small voice saying "Maybe this isn't right." and another voice saying, "But Matt is right for me.".  Conflicting and all.  He agreed that maybe this wasn't the right thing to do.  That we're moving to fast to something important and at the same time, lowering our standards of what is important.    What is important?  I don't know.  I like him a lot.  I want to be with him.  All the time.  I want to live in an apartment with him washing dishes and putting them away.  I want to hold him and kiss him.  And rub the side of his face for the stubble.  I like to rub my hair against him since he likes that.  And rub my legs between his.  I like to kiss his neck.  And smell him.  And kiss him.  And I guess the important thing is to spend as much time together as possible.  Because pretty soon, he's leaving.  For a long time.  But at the same time, I want to do as much stuff with him as possible.  Because I like him.  A lot.  A lot.  I don't know.  Maybe its my biology and sex drive kicking in.  But where the hell was my sex drive in the car?  I don't know.  Right now, it is important that I talk to him.  Sigh.
