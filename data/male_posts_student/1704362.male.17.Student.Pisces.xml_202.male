If his duties aren't too taxing, perhaps Edwards can continue "Crossing Over" in the White House.      EDWARDS:  [closes eyes and massages temples] I'm getting a U. Uk... Ud...  HUSSEIN:  Yes! Yes, Uday! How is the rascal?  EDWARDS:  He's telling me... He wants to know, "Where the fuck are my virgins?"
