I don't really get some of them. It really depends on how you look at it...and we have to write a compo by onday. HOW EXCITING!!! LOL      Then...Geography. We dodn't have early recess for once. Apparently the other teachers have COMPLAINED. Goes to show how some teachers are power-crazy megalomaniacs who cannot see students having extra fun. Did soem group work on Earthquakes...was rather fun. This despite the fact that I had Kevin in my group.      After some animal Farm, went to CS for Flash. Made this stupid fat guy run and run, Lame, but still completed the project. Had time to play some SSB later. PWNEd someone with Kirby. So cute...      Alright...soon it was the chinese tern test. Did ok i guess. The letter was good, but the compo wasn't that good...so it evens out!
