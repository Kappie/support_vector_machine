I thought I was mad at him, and that's why I kept thinking of him. Now I realize it was more than a yearning. I'm still in love. Yesterday as I got home, drunk and sad, I wrote him an e-mail. I wrote so many hurtful things for me. I even tried to ... I was sad. It was sad.   He's been coming to visit me [ as I've said before ] the past two Tuesdays. I went to bed on Monday feeling all around uneasy. At work on Tuesday, I kept looking at the clock. At four o'clock I sat in the living room and did not move from there all day... expectant... waiting... waiting for a moment that did not come! What was I thinking? That he'll be back? That he would embrace me again? Sad. Long and sad afternoon. So sad. So Long.   Why do I keep on loving so much? Is there a point? What I understand now is this: I can't keep hurting and bashing myself on the matter, I have to be clear and talk to him. Not looking an answer that I know will never come, I ... just ... I don't want the opportunity to pass. I'm in love. Still in love. I keep on loving you. I love you!    Adrian!      Yes indeed I’m alone again  And here comes emptiness crashing in  It’s either love or hate  I can’t find in between  Cause I’ve been with witches  And I have been with a queen   It wouldn’t have worked out any way  So now it’s just another lonely day  Further along we just may  But for now it’s just another lonely day   Wish there was something  I could say or do  I can resist anything  But temptation from you  But I’d rather walk alone  Than chase you around  I’d rather fall myself  Than let you drag me down   It wouldn’t have worked out any way  And now it’s just another lonely day  Further along we just may  But for now it’s just another lonely day   Yesterday seems like a life ago  Cause the one I love  Today I hardly know  You I held so close in my heart oh dear  Grow further from me  With every fallen tear   It wouldn’t have worked out any way  So now it’s just another lonely day  Further along we just may  But for now it’s just another lonely day   Another Lonely Day.
