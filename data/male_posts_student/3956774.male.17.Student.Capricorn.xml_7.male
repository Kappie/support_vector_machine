A little puzzle did but irritate me yesteryear. The said puzzle was brought to my attention to Heldric, who is one half of the troublesome duo Layla...or is it lemer...or pehaps Leilo...Lido...Lickspittle...oh i dont know wel shes part of this cliqe, anyway she mentioned there was a comment on one of my blogs, naturally this intrugued me so i trundled online to have a look, only to find it had been removed by a blog administrator! Shock Horror! The comment had been left by none other than Stringy...I quizzed this bouncy haired being but he was alusive. Was it rude? what did it say??? I must know...Whats that? Someone fell down the old mine shaft...Go ahead young man!
