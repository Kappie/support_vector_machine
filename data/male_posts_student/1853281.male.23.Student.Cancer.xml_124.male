I had finished my mitts for smoking in the winter a few weeks ago and had not other projects to work on, other then patchwork and that is kinda boring. So i looked around to see what yarn i have. I am officially out of commercially bought yarn, and i have several balls and skeins of somewhat similair gauge homespun of various colors. All wool though. Decided that i am going to make another project for me. Out of all the pairs of homespun socks i have made i have never made a pair for me, and so that is what i did last night. Started a pair of socks. The uppers are stipes of madder dyed red and navaho tea yellow, sounds garish, but they work together. Heels will be natural grey, feet, stripes of white and black wool. Hopefully that will use up a bunch of the little odds and ends that i have left, and then i can make a scarf or hat or something for someone for christmass. I kow Droid wants a scarf. Like J-Dawgs. Will have to see. have to get some more wool. I have been iching to spin again and haven't sine i spun the last of my fleece last november. Oh Well. Meeting My dad's girlfriend tonight, can't confess that i am looking forward to it, but i am sure it will be fine. What could go wrong?
