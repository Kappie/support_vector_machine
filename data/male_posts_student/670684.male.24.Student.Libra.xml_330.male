In 2000 the SGA bought 60 tickets for the Centenary/LSU game in Baton Rouge and gave them to students...I didn't get to go (as was the case with most of the SGA...a pretty selfless act for most everyone), but I heard it was a wonderful time.  Anyway, this was my chance to see the Gents in action, against a team they could quite possibly beat.    And they did.  It was ugly, but Centenary hung in there, and then started getting turnovers and free throws to fall, and they put the game away in the last few minutes.    Before the game, Bowden and I made a bet on how many people from Centenary that we recognized would be there.  The over/under was seven...he went under, I went over.  We entered the arena about 20 minutes prior to tipoff, and the place was dead...not a good sign.  But to the right of us about eight sections I spotted someone who looked vaguely familiar...someone I never really gave a shit about, but a Centenary student nevertheless.  And as the game progressed, more came, and then suddenly we saw a quite familiar face in the crowd, wearing his traditional blazer, sweater vest, and collared shirt.    Dr. Ken Schwab, president of Centenary College.    So Bowden and I went down, and ran into some of the other heads of state at the old 'nary...Gene Gregory, David Hennington, Kathy Fell...Fell actually will be in Austin on Thursday, and invited me to breakfast, a great gesture considering I spearheaded a rebellion to a move she had pursued for years at Centenary.  But we ended up getting along in the end, and while there will be some awkwardness at the breakfast, it's nice to feel important enough to get invites to those kinds of things.    It's tough for me to describe the Centenary experience without coming off as a brocheure or as a pretentious ass clown.  But at that school I wielded a lot of push...I wouldn't say power per se, but I got in a lot of groups, and students in those groups listened to me, so students outside of those groups listened to me as well, and so then faculty and staff were kind of obligated to listen to me also.  It was a great time, and taught me some wonderful lessons about power, corruption, and doing the right thing.  Centenary is a lot of the backbone to the script I'm writing.    Scott Greenwood, the former Dean of Students at Centenary, and I met up in North Carolina over the summer, grabbing lunch and having a talk about the past, present, and future.  On two occasions he mentioned that about 50 schools would be closing down in the next 10 years due to the economy and budget cuts in education.  "Centenary will not be one of those," he said, which was interesting because he said it...I never considered it would be one, but when he brought it up, it reminded me that Centenary is a small school that depends heavily on enrollment and that enrollment doing something, and recently it's hit hard times on enrollment, student output, keeping faculty, and staying with the ties.    The school thrives on lucking out.  For instance, I play the French Horn (should say played, but I want to pick it up again).  Centenary had a band, and a pretty poor one from reputation.  I didn't bother to contact the band when I applied...I just figured I'd try out, make it, and that would be that.  When I tried out, the band director asked if I'd be willing to switch to Trumpet...he had five french horns, and didn't really need another.  I said I'd rather not...I was a good horn player, and wanted to stick with it.  He let me, and within a month I was playing 1st Horn music, getting the solos, and carrying the section.  I was the best non-major musician in the band, and probably could have held my own with some of the majors.  I got a scholarship for music, and found my way into the orchestra, chamber winds, and brass quintent.  To me, it was just playing music.  But for Gail Odom and the music school, it was a pretty big gift...out of nowhere they got a major-caliber horn player for four years.    I've got to run to my first class of the semester...on the drive back from Houston, I was thinking about stories.  I love stories because they don't end...they just keep going on and on and on.  Yeah, an event ends, but then it parlays itself into something else.  I didn't end the April Landry story, or this odd non-sequiter on Centenary...I will wrap them up, but they don't end.
