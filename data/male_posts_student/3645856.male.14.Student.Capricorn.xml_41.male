Most Cubans said they were amazed that the U.S. government would allow someone to make and show a film like Fahrenheit 911 to the public, and live to see it. The Bush administration and a lot of other scumbag Republicans used every dirty trick in the book to stop it from being shown, a lot of theatre owners have been threatened and are too frightened to show it. Typical lowlife Republicans only believe in free speech when it comes to political donations.   urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/040730/325/ez7g0.html   I went to work yesterday. It was a big mess afterwards...lol. And during a hurricane as well....never landscape during a hurricane. Tsk, tsk, tsk, have I any judment at all? I really wonder sometimes. I really don't need the money anyway but I like to work. Afterwards, I went to my grandmother's house. Did random things as she is still moving things in and arranging. We've ran down to North Carolina already four times since April... moving it load by load. I think we got the last load of furniture last weekend. It's painful being stuck in the cab of a uhaul for 5 hours. And it doesn't help being in a traffic jam and seeing an overturned and totaled uhaul with an entire dual wheel laying in the median either. Anywho, I rearranged furniture, painted, put up shelves, hooked up her computer, tv, stereos.... etc. Random little things like that. I had to program her telephones. I don't see a point in having four or five telephones as three of them are portable anyway. But... whatever she wants.  I stopped at Winter Sound and got a new guitar as well. I bought a new... (well, it was a 2003, but it was still brand new and unsold) 2003 Fender Standard Series Stratocaster. I kind of miss my old Fender '57 Reissue strat, so I played a few new guitars they had in stock and finally found a metallic jade green colored strat. The guitar changes colors in certain light. Sometimes it looks metallic silver or pewter, but it's really a metallic jade color. Alder body... maple neck and fretboard... etc. etc. Sounds more bright and crispier than my old one... my old one was more Stevie Ray Vaughan-esque sounding... as in his guitar "Number one"... I'd say this one is more like his other guitar Lenny. I like the tremolo on it... I've dive-bombed it and tried my best but I just can't get the thing to go out of tune. Beats me. Maybe I should stray away from 50s and 60s vintage strats in the future and just buy cheap old mexican Fenders. (Oh, good geal on it, $319.00... with tax it was $337.xx)... if I ordered it from  urlLink http://www.musiciansfriend.com , it would have been $349.00... though I could probably get any color I want (the color doesn't really matter) and they'd throw in free shipping... but I like the color. If I was to buy one off of musician's friend, It would probably be in Tabbaco sunburst, brown sunburst, two tone, or three tone if I didn't get the metallic jade color. Yes, I'm a big sunburst finish fan. I wish they would go back to nitrocellulose finishes... these sure won't age like the ones from the 1950s. It would take a nuclear bomb for it to age and get the sound to change. Oh well... good deal anyways. I'm not sure if I like it better than my Gibson Les Paul.... way different animal though. I don't get my 1960 reissue les paul... the ceramic humbuckers (at least the neck) are always giving feedback and doing all this weird shit. The only reason I became such a Neil Young fan is because someone told me (I can't remember who) that when I played that thing it sounded like Neil Young's 1953 Les Paul, Old Black. So, I bought Rust Never Sleeps and Harvest.. lo and behold... OMG... is that my les paul? Since then, I have bought a dozen or so Neil Young albums and I also managed to stumble across a vintage Martin of David Crosby's on ebay and bought it. I'm going to see Crosby, Stills, and Nash August 13th.... anywho, enough of that. My amplifier is still on... I've been playing on and off since I woke up this morning around 8:00. I fell asleep last night while Shelly was busting a pedophile... :p... eh... ta ta for now.  Mood: cold isn't a mood... but it's 91 degrees outside, I cut the A/C off and i'm still freezing.  TV: It's off... but I am going to turn it on as soon as I'm done with this post.  Music:... The last thing I listened to was Neil Young's unplugged album in the shower this morning.  ~ George
