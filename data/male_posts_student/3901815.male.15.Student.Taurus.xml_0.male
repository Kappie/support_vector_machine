Jeff Tweedy and company have produced a wonderfully sparse musical landscape, and spread it over 67 minutes. I love this album!      In other news: ............................well, nothing much has been happening in my case. I've just been listening to Wilco continuiously (AgIb and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot), and strumming on my guitar not so quietly in my house. The play ended, and we had a pretty successful run. It was magic in the making.  That's all for now. Catch you all later!  ---Ben B. Mood: Happy. Listening to: Wilco - Live At The Vic Theatre In Chicago Thought: "mmm....now I know the meaning of the words Country Feedback......*in joke alert!*..."
