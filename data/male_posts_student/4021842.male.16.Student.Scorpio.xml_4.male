Why do i have a misguided soul. It's hard, because within me there's a battle raging between my heart and my mind, my soul however is being innocent. I'm not all that sure what to do, i've passed up too many chances in the past. My heart tells me to do one thing, and my mind says something else. Why do i have to be this way?...Why am i broken inside. Why Can't anyone help me find the missing pieces to the puzzle that is my ghostly life. Ijust dont get it, from my Dad leaving two years ago, without even saying good bye, To my friendsbetraying me, i dont know who to trust anymore....or even if ishould trust anyone.I dont know whatto do, maybe i should just go into my corner and just be secluded forawhile.
