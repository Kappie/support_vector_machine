US-Iraq is already covered.  Tune in to CNN and you'll hear about Sudan and their suspicious activity.  The New York Times has Iran-Iraq relations reported.  The purpose of this column is to increase awareness of things going on in the world.  I suspect you'll hear stuff about Africa that you didn't have a clue was happening.  Asia will be heard.  The American media does not cover these topics particularly well, for financial reasons, I suspect; why report something the masses won't care about?  I'm not writing for the masses (not yet, at least :)  Rwanda has had it's problems.  I personally believe the media uses the word "genocide" a bit too much.  It just sort of loses the effect.  Rwanda is a different story.  In April 1994, ethnic tensions in the country resulted in organized genocided of the minority ethnic group of Tutsis.  800000 of them.  This was, literally, government officials handing out machetes to loyal Hutus to kill Tutsis and killing those that wouldn't do the government's bidding.  The country has come a long way since that point, but the country is definitely scarred.  Enter this week's political issue.  A Rwandan parlimentary commission has "suggested" the disbandment of a leading human rights group in the country, which goes by its French acronym LIPRODOR.  The Human Rights Watch (HRW) has responded to the commisssion because LIPRODOR, a promoter of essential rights such as freedom of speech and expression and critical of the government's record on the promotion and protection of human rights, is threatening the Rwandan government in terms of dissent.  Apparently, the government treats dissenting ideas in the political arena as "genocidal".  Furthermore, a senior Rwandan official says that genocidal ideas cannot hide behind the freedom of speech.  I concur, for the most part; nevertheless, dissenting to governmental land holding is NOT genocide-related, is it?  Equally remarkable is the 2003 ban of the main opposition party in Rwanda before presidential and parliamentary elections.  Given the absurdity of the allegations of genocide today in Rwanda, this is likely nothing more than oppression in the arena.  Readers, this must not be tolerated.  I was not a supporter of the Iraq war, and reason was that there are several places in the world where intervention is much more needed.  Rwanda is such a place.  If you have any comments, they are appreciated; please leave them.  Ponce
