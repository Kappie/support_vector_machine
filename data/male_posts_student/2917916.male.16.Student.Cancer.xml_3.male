I knew that if I bought some Powerball tickets, I would win the lottery! So I made my dad buy a few tickets. It gets verified that I won at 9:59...only 40 minutes to go! I don't know why, but I just have a feeling that I will win. I am SO excited! I have everything ARRANGED PERFECTLY! $500,000 Goes to Charity. $500,000 goes to my personal spending. With that $500,000...I will buy a new car and a Sony Lap Top. I will also put a spiral staircase in my room leading up to a third floor which I will be adding. The third floor will have a movie theatre, my master bedroom, my master bathroom, an office, a sitting room and a hot tub. The other $4,200,000 will go into a savings account. I will gain 5% every year giving me around $230,000 a year for the rest of my entire life!  Derek doesn't think I'm gonna win, but he is just a doubter. If by some weird chance I don't win than it was a glitch. Something went wrong and fait was cursed by some evil person, probably Derek! Atleast Matt believes me! He will be the first to ride in my Porsche 911 Turbo! ~Andy Feeling Of The Moment: GREED!
