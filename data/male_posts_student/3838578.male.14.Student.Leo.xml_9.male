I am currently working on a new matrix comic, the characters can be found here: (Copy and Paste)http://img78.photobucket.com/albums/v325/Totey/Mat.bmp  But let's rewind to yesterday, shall we?  Nothing much went on yesterday, except for the best soccer game of our season. We passed great, shot great, ran great, and won! I was so happy that we won. Obviously however, it didn't restore any faith in our team. But that doesn't matter.  We went out for supper to my Grandma's, where my aunt from Toronto made supper. I thought I wouldn't be hungry since I had just gotten my braces adjusted. But I guess I ate a lot for not being hungry.   I made two new comics and put them up on my website. I also posted some stuff on my forums and wrote another part of my story. Both which can be found at www.geocities.com/looseends26  My brother has been having his friend over every day this week. I am frankly getting sick of him coming over and taking over my room. One of these times I just might accidentally drop a knife or something. Of course I'm kidding. If you though I was serious than I pity you.  I also got my hair cut, it doesn't look sooo bad, but at least it's not layers. It'll grow back, it always does.  I am waiting for Michaela to get back from her lake on Saturday so that we can do a huge Loose Ends overhaul.  Well, See ya next time and Hakuna Matata!  Anita
