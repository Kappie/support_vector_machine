"The stubborn twit that never listens to anyone else and just generally blames those around him", i.e. James, who seems to be happy to insult himself by giving himself an accurate reference in his own post. This sprung up in response to an argument that, yes, I started, involving two authors. The reason I started it is because James (Taking note of his self-reference) has said when he brought the book "Eats, Shoots & Leaves" by Lynne Truss, that Terry Pratchett, AKA "That prat with the beard" is a terrible author, whereas he is one of the greatest of living novelists. Call it obsessed if you want, but a novelist that has reached double best-seller figures in double figure languages is not going to do it by being rubbish. Now I have read an excerpt from Lynne Truss's book, and I have quickly concluded that, mildly humerous as it may be, Someone who writes "First there is shock. Within seconds, shock gives way to disbelief, disbelief to pain, and pain to anger. Finally (and this is where the analogy breaks down), anger gives way to a righteous urge to perpetrate an act of criminal damage." About a badly misspelled sign is clearly several marbles short of a box with only two marbles in it. Look, I just want you to realise that there are better books than those about the terrors of a misplaced, comma. Even if you don't like Terry's books, condemning them and insulting the author just because of some anal-retentive (hah) author who her own family would quite like to disown (she admits this herself) is, quite frankly, pathetic. I will speak no more of this.  P.S. It's spelt 'plague'.
