I swear that fish gave me an evil glare. I also discovered another strange aspect of my dog's accidental programming. She won't eat until AFTER her walk, so off we went. Of course, I forgot shoes, so it was painful and I burned several hundred skin cells. Some strange construction is going on at Claudia's church, and they're were a bunch of cars there too. They're was also this old dude standing in a bunch of plants next to a stop sign from across the street staring. My guess, either insane guy, or a minister or someone who needed out of the heat(it was shaded). I prefer to think insane guy.  I am now on Jonathan's link page, so my life is complete.....or something.  Important announcement everyone: the Taco Bell Express at the Mountain View Target sells meat products again! Yay! Of course, they then proceeded to tell me they were out of cheese quesidillas, so it sucked anyway.  Tristan, Lizzy and I came to three discoveries last night. One, Big Bird in Japan is still the best movie ever(ok, that was mostly me). Two, there is still nothing entertaining to do at my house. Three, my cat really DOES talk. Hold me.   Big Bird in Japan has still not been released on DVD. Shame shame. Question: If I was so happy about the Taco Bell in Target selling meat again, why was I trying to order a cheese quasedilla? And why is it that a year and a half later, I still can't spell that?
