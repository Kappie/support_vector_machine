A trip to the dentist. Not the most exciting of experiences, I can say. I went in, I sat down, someone looked in my mouth, and then I left 5 minutes later. Well that was a waste of time.    I also finished watching most of the special features from the 3 Lord of the Rings DVDs. Some were actually quite interesting. But yes, another waste of time.    And that is my day so far, other than a bit o' interent browsing.    Fun fun fun. :) Later I plan to learn some more Esperanto, and practice writing with my left hand. If I get very bored... And then there's Lord of the Rings to read, which I would have wanted to get finished by 31st July (when they are due back at the library) I'll never make it, but I'll try to get the first two books done.    Bye for now.     Weather:  Cloudy, clear earlier. Quite warm   Reading:  Fellowship of the Ring (same place I was last time I blogged)   Listening to:  Good Stuff   Watching:  The Hole, last night. Very good I thought.   Confused about:  Nothing   Annoyed with:  Boredom   Mood:  Bored
