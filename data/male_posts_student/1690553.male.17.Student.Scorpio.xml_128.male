Still need to verify some informations regarding the projects so there' would be no wrong information regarding the projects. But if you urgently need more information regarding the projects feel free to call the Project Manager Mr. Nazri Ibrahim at 019-9323980. You could also contact Mr. Azman at 013-9529272 regarding the orphanage home.  Thanks for reading. Will be back blogging next Monday because this weekend I'm out of town. :-)
