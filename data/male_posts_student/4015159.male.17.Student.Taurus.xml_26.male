The Ninth Task          Today I will be writing Act 1 Scene 1 of a movie called The Cross. Because I have been working on the project over a year now I have a basic plot but have never written it in a movie format. I believe I will be able to pass this task and hopefully it will put my creative mind back into gear! Wish me luck peeps! :D
