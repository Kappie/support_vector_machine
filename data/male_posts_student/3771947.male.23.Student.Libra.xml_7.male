Friday, got to return the stupid tile cutter, which CANNOT cut a fucking strait line, then I am going to stop at my fathers toshower and hit the gym later. I might be trying out for special forces so I need to start to get back into shape. I havn't ran five miles in at least 6 months.   Well, I have not been out since Tuesday, and Dan is pissing me off, so I guess I'll go out.Sitting at home gets me NOWHERE. I guess I don't pick up my phone?   I have to be up by 0600 tomorrow so it will have to be local tonight. Rick called and Monday he wants to go to NYC to hit the China club. Tuesday Andy is coming to visit so we will be at McGrady's. Andy has court on the 5th so he might not be able to go to Kiawah with me, he might fly instead. I guess Mytrle (our old stomping grounds)is out, at least with Andy. Krol, my former sniper friend called, the old platoon is well. They are recruiting new guys to fill my, and others,vacancies. This weekend I have some stupid picnic and "Freedom Salute." The Army is really gay but they might let us go at 1600 tomorrow, that is great. Scott called and said hi, he is getting big from all the steriods he does. Doug has yet to call me back, what a jerk. I have no idea what his problem is. He still ows me like $90.   I sold my old cell phone on E-bay, I asked for ten dollars and it sold for 52. I LOVE E-BAY! Time to sell a lot more shit. School is right around the corner. It is almost time to start packing, I guess I will have to make up with my Mom so she can help.
