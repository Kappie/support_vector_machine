I missed second period preparing a notice for all the election monitors and finishing up sorting the ballots.  I ran the notices to 12 of the 14 monitors in all their respective classes (the last two were no where to be found) just as the bell rung for the end of second period.  CHAOS.  I sped down to the COSA Office where they were all told to rendezvous at and though I didn't get a count, all the election monitors were definitely not there.  They all flooded Mr. Frye and he just randomly gave out folders (each official class/home room had it's own manilla folder filled with blank ballots).  The jobs of the election monitors would be to distribute them, have each official class/home room vote, then collect them, all in a 15 minute window of time--7 floors, approx 30 official classes, over 1500 ballots--the entire election that I had organized almost collapsed.  I ended up distributing and collecting on floors 7,5,4, and even 3.  I was all over the place, sprinting, yelling at kids to vote, etc.  Finally, we hauled down all the folders with the completed ballots and the counting began.  I headed over to the COSA Office during lunch to check if my help was needed and I came just in time to see them finish the tallys for the votes for the President and Vice President of the Junior class.  JANELLE AND I WON!  Out of approx. 600 sophomores, only about 300 kids voted.  Janelle and I got 131 of those votes, the second place group, Innis and Sherica got 87 votes, and the two other groups got about 40 each.  I was very pleased and proud that I had put in the work to create an election that led to my victory.  I can't wait to start in my position next year.  Janelle and I have a bunch of great stuff planned.  -Reinstatement of a Junior Prom for the first time in 14 years. -Standard extra credit added to the schoolwide grading rubric for coming to Saturday tutoring. -Strict enforcement of the schoolwide test schedule. -Saturday SAT tutoring -Scheduling kids for visits to the college office during Junior year rather than Senior year -Thematic school parties (costume parties, etc.) -More stuff that I won't even say here.
