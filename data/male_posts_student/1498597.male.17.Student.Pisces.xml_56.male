Anyway, yeah we need to start bloggin'...and so here I am, bringin' you a fresh new blog...an oasis in a blog-barren desert!  OK, here we go...!  First off,  SCHOOL IS OUT !  Yeah, thats right!  Today was our last day of the school year, therefore concludin' our  sophomore year  and beginnin' our  summer vacation !  That means more time to do what we want!  And one of the things we want to do is blog!  So, that means we have more time to blog!  Today,  Elizabeth , her younger sister  Amanda ,  Elyse ,  Eddie , and  myself  attended  Finding Nemo  at the  Corona 15 .  All I havta say is: what a great movie!  A movie about the adventures of fish and other ocean creatures...how exactly could you fuckin' go wrong with that!?  Well, yeah it was an excellent movie, I even shed a few tears!  Hey, its  Disney , they're kinda good at the tear-jerkers.    Umm...that is kinda it for now!  More blogs are headin' your way!  Oh yeah, be sure to check out the  P.R.E. , as I will be bloggin' about authority today!  Also check out  Go Ahead...Read This Only if You Dare , as  Nick  also updates frequently.    One last message:  Elyse , start workin' on yer fuckin' blog!
