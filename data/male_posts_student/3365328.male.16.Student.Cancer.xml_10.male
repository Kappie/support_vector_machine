After much waiting around for the unlucky bunch who had their exam today to leave, we got to rehearsing our play. 'It Started With a Kiss' by John Godber is about a group of yound adults going to a college in northern England to be drama teachers. There's 6 people in th play, and I play Rich. Our bit of it lasts half an hour (in order to get a big enough part for everyone for the A*s to start flying).   We rehearsed by ourselves for a while, then eventually the teacher who said she'd help us turned up and we performed it all the way through, props and all. We got plenty of laughs (my brilliant comic acting contributed to this :D) and it all seemed to go well... We'll see when tomorrow comes!
