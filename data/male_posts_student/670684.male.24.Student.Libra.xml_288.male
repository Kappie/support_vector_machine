I used to be a fan of the phrase  I hate my life  when something superfluous went wrong and I really didn't care but people expected me to...I doubt I'll change to  I am pathetic , but said events could transpire.    TA meeting with Richard Lewis this morning.  Walking in, seeing that the professor I now work for is UT's closest look-alike to Tim Robbins, and noticing the camraderie between Lewis and two of his TAs, as well as their banter regarding the LA scene, scripts, writers who visit UT...I see that I am a nobody in the screenwriting world.  No one.  Not even a small tadger in the Austin stream.  I haven't bothered to make a name.  I haven't befriended a faculty member like I used to at Centenary.  I haven't prostituted myself or my work in order to get name recognition and nods at parties where the girls are hot and everyone is talking about David Lynch because  his films are so fucked up .    I don't know what my efforts are.  I want to write screenplays, but I don't want to live the convoluted life of a Hollywood type, making gossip about Ben and J-Lo, wondering who Nicole Kidman is going to settle down with, and tying those references back to hip lingo in the writer's circuit.  I've done crowds before...a degree in English assures you entry into a crowd of pretentiousness.  I'm tired of the pretentiousness, the postmodern crowd, where any Roland Barthes name-drop turns a few heads of folks who don't understand modern postmodernist theory or cultural studies at all, but saw  urlLink Empire of Signs  on an ex's bedside table during a night of dull fucking, and said ex used to wear black and talk about feelings, so Barthes must be worth something, even though a strong tenent of Barthes' message is about worthlessness of said situations and images.  But if you talk about Barthes while drinking a 40 of Mickey's, we're as cool as cool can be.  I want to write.  I want to find a community of people who make art, and are good at it.  I want to make films with these people.  I want these films to be accessable to a broad spectrum of folks.  I want to submerge my body in a warm ocean.
