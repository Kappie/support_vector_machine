Because it is a hell lot easier as far as I can tell. So this will give me some time to relax my head for college and things and to review maybe some things I might have forgotten how to do long ago. Plus, the teacher isn't going to give us a load of homework. Yeah!  Yet I am still unsure about what class I'm suppose to take and I guess I will find out maybe tomorrow or so. But as of right now, I am going to hold off on returning the book until Thursday. I think that after this week, you can no longer change classes and then I can just relax an go with the flow. Because if I am not mistaken, by failing Algebra 2 second smemester, I should be in Discrete. But I no longer know now because this year is pretty confusing. (God is testing me, I know it. He is always doing this to me and he never stops with me. I never had a break ever since Middle. Ahh!)  Anyway, the rest of my classes are cool. I think I may like American History a bit more then others. But then again, there is always Web Site design and Comercial Design too. It's a hard choice, huh? LOL!  Well, got to go. I am going to surf some and then relax. I am not going to read my summer reading until maybe this Friday because none of my classes have said anything about it yet. In fact, I think they forgot about it completely which is a good thing. Well, later!    Wolfwood
