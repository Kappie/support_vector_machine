My friend  urlLink Mike  started a blog called  urlLink Christian Teen Issues . He included me in on it (nice guy) and I am now the Vice President (appparently; didn't know until just recently). Well, I am hoping that this will strengthen my faith in God. Right now, I have nothing much more to say. I will talk to you all later.  "[Elektra is reading]  Matt Murdock: Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find some honey?  Elektra [not looking up]: It's right in front of you.  Matt Murdock: You're going to need to be a little more specific.  Elektra: What are you...  Matt Murdock: Blind? Yeah." --Daredevil
