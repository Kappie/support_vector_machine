If you can't visualize it, let me help you with these examples of politically correct and left leaning variations of classic stories.   Little Red Riding Hood  would read:  Red :  Why Grandmother, what a small welfare check you have!  ----   The Tortoise and the Hare  would read:  Tortoise :  Yay!  I won the race!   Hare :  What?! There's no way I could have lost!  I demand a recount!  ----   Snow White and the Seven Dwarves  Would be titled:  Snow White and the Seven Gay Dwarves   ----   The Boy Who Cried Wolf  would be titled:  The Bush Who Cried WMDs   ----   Frosty the Snowman  would read:  Frosty :  Oh no, I'm starting to melt!   Karen :  Dang it, and it's all because of global warming!  ----   Cinderella  would meet  Princess Charming .  ----   Jack and the Beanstalk  would read:  Jack's Mom :  Quick Jack!  Kill the Giant!   Jack :  Not yet mom.  I have to wait until I can prove that he has "a smoking gun."  ----   Chicken Little  would read:   Chicken Little :  THE SKY IS FALLING! THE SKY IS FALLING, AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF BUSH'S IRRESPONSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES!  ----  * Romeo and Juliet  would read: Juliet:  Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo, and didst thou remember to bring "protection?"    Okay, so  Romeo and Juliet  isn't actually a kids' story.  Still, I couldn't resist...
