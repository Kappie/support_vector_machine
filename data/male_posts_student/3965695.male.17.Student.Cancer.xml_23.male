So I feel better, but still cant do anything for several weeks.  weeks.    I'll get better eventually    I watched  urlLink Serpico  yesterday- go see it. its a late 70s movie with Al Pacino. My dad saw it back when he was young (er) and liked Serpico so much he grew his beard out and bought a hat to look like him.  urlLink Here is a pic of Serpico.  Picture my dad looking like that, walking around the streets of philly. Wow.     Well, on my road to recovery i have been able to watch a lot of tv that I usually dont watch, like Queer Eye for the straight guy, trading spaces, lot of Game Show network, etc. And now I am going to watch what is sure to be another installment of TV reaching new lows, with Fox's "trading spouses." Weeee.
