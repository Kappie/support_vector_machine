They may hate you, they may hate your relationship, they may be racist, they may be stupid, they may be arrogant, they may be pretentious, they may be snobs... But they are still her parents and, especially if you marry her, they will be a part of your life. And perhaps more importantly, they are what made the woman you love. They helped shaped who she is --through good or bad-- she is who she is due in large part to her parents.  Now, I'm not saying you need to revere them or buy them gifts, but you should at least be civil to them and not make the situation worse for her or your relationship. Put up with them whenever you have to. It will GREATLY help in the long run.
