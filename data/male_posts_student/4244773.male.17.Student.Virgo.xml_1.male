The ball was coming towards me and the defenders were running to it, so without hessitation i ran towards the ball. As i was about to head the ball to the goal, suddenly i felt a sharp pain on my jaw...... then i realise someone kicked me on my jaw, i was stunned for a few moment. After few minutes i started shouting and yellin' to the person that kicked me, all fowl words were coming out of my mouth but my friends chilled me down.  But it wasn't over yet, the pain resumes...... this time it was that person who gets a piece of me. When i got the ball, he tried to defend....getting a chance, i kicked the ball hard with anger towards him expecting to hit his body, but instead it flew hard towards his face. He was lucky the ball did not break his nose, only his lips were cracked. But he did not yell at me, maybe he thinks that it was a repay of what he did earlier. Anyway nothing went wrong after that, we forgave each other and went for a drink to chill out. But this is a painful game as well as a painful experience.
