Nevertheless I'm going to keep posting because it's always fun to read my old entries.  Alright, today was alright.  I would have liked to have more time to just relax but I haven't gotten much sleep the last few days.  Yesterday morning or I should say Wednesday night we picked up my brother at the airport.  He was given time off for Christmas from basic training.  He has to go back for 3 days.  Mom is telling me to go to bed.  Good night.
