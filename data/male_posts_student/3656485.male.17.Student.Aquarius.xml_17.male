Truly the greatest game ever invented within the last forever. I feel it is now time to release some rules out to the public, so as to even further spread the influence of Ballacrosse.  Ruleses:  1: Ballacrosse may be played anywhere under the conditions that you have a) a ball, and b) a court (any size/shape). Latest courts have been portions of football fields, soccer fields, and tennis courts. 2: Said Court must have a series of containing lines dividing the court in half and tracing the outside edges of the court. 3: Service must be from the back of the court, allowing the ball to drop once before kicking to the other side of the court. 4: After the serve teams may feel free to juggle the ball (without the use of hands) by or between any amount of individuals on said team. 5: the ball may be allowed to bounce once before a team makes contact with it, but it musnt touch the ground again until transferred into the other teams quadrant 6: All lines are played as redo's. The ball is returned to serving team and put into play. 7: Teams my chose to play a ball which has hit the line, but forfeit the right to a replay in doing so. 8: A ball may be played outside of the court. However, to pass to the other team requires that it be played from within boundaries during the pass. 9: Score is kept like old school volleyball (No rally scoring). At 11 teams switch sides of the playing field for the next round of play. The winning team must be ahead by 2.  And there you have it... I would like to thank all of those who have made the game great. Let's have a balla good time this summer tearing it up with the Balla action. Pharrelll!  Goldfish taste bad.
