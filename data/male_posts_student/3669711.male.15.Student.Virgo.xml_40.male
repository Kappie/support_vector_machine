But, while i'm waiting for things to emerge and compile, i like to read.    The book that i have been reading is the first in the Left Behind series.  When i first picked it up, i didn't think i would enjoy it much.  Then, i started to get into it, and well, i could hardly put it down (unless i thought my gentoo emerge was finished ^_^).    I must say, i was impressed with the book, and i must also say that i can't wait to read the next one (which is on hold at my local library).  This book has left me hungry for more, and even though it is just 'fiction', i would personally say that it is bringing me closer to God, and making my faith in Him stronger.  Well, here i go to watch TSS!  Lates!
