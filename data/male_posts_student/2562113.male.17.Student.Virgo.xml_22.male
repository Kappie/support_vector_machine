That doesn't mean that I didn't have a good time because that would just be untrue. I did have a good time, overall, but there were a few points in the night that I could have used without. I don't really want to say anything about what happened because the two occurences that I'm talking about are pretty sensative areas. Let me just say that I don't regret the 3 hours I spent in that state of pissed-offness because I think that it helped. At least I hope it did. The other 15 minutes I'm talking about were just personal tough times because I'm a mental case and a romantic. Now I'm just ranting, but it's all good. This year better not suck. As of now, there have not been any smutty activities in my life except that time that I wore a girls bathingsuit and swam pretty slow.
