It probably won’t matter to anyone, but it does to me.  I’m linking here to a page on  urlLink Moorewatch.com , consisting of a series of pieces from the National Review and the New York Times (gasp) about the Halliburton mythology.  We’re talking 5,300 words of journalism, so if you want to continue with this idea that Cheney is darkly manipulating things to get contracts to Halliburton, you go right ahead.  Here’s some excerpts, but I encourage you to take ten minutes and read it all.    Last November, the Corps assigned Kellogg Brown  Root (KBR), which has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Halliburton since the 1960s, to do a classified study of potential damage and repairs in the Iraqi oil fields. Contrary to Waxman’s assertion, the work was done under a competitively awarded contract system known as the U.S. Army Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or LOGCAP.  ….  LOGCAP is, in effect, a multi-year supercontract. In it, the Army makes a deal with a single contractor, in this case Halliburton, to perform a wide range of unspecified services during emergency situations in the future. The last competition for LOGCAP came in 2001, when Halliburton won the contract over several other bidders. Thus, when the oil-field study was needed, Corps officials say, Halliburton was the natural place to turn. “To invite other contractors to compete to perform a highly classified requirement that Kellogg Brown  Root was already under a competitively awarded contract to perform would have been a wasteful duplication of effort,” Corps commander Lt. Gen. Robert Flowers wrote to Waxman in April.  ….  “Only KBR, the contractor that developed the complex, classified contingency plans, could commence implementing them on extremely short notice,” Flowers wrote Waxman. “The timing was driven by Central Command’s operational requirement to have support available in advance of possibly imminent hostilities.” Flowers added that the contract was always intended as a temporary “bridge” to a more permanent contract that would be offered for competitive bidding.  ….  The LOGCAP payment method, known as a cost-plus-award, calls for KBR to be paid its costs plus a profit of 1 percent. According to the General Accounting Office, KBR could also earn “an incentive fee of up to nine percent of the cost estimate, based on the contractor’s performance in a number of areas, including cost control.”  ….  The first LOGCAP was awarded in 1992, as the first Bush administration (including then-Secretary of Defense Cheney) was leaving office. Four companies competed, and the winner was Brown  Root, as it was known at the time (Halliburton changed the name to Kellogg Brown  Root after an acquisition in 1998). The multi-year contract was in effect during much of the Clinton administration. During those years, Brown  Root did extensive work for the Army under the LOGCAP contract in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia; contract workers built base camps and provided troops with electrical power, food, and other necessities.  In 1997, when LOGCAP was again put up for bid, Halliburton/Brown  Root lost the competition to another contractor, Dyncorp. But the Clinton Defense Department, rather than switch from Halliburton to Dyncorp, elected to award a separate, sole-source contract to Halliburton/Brown  Root to continue its work in the Balkans. According to a later GAO study, the Army made the choice because 1) Brown  Root had already acquired extensive knowledge of how to work in the area; 2) the company “had demonstrated the ability to support the operation”; and 3) changing contractors would have been costly. The Army’s sole-source Bosnia contract with Brown  Root lasted until 1999. At that time, the Clinton Defense Department conducted full-scale competitive bidding for a new contract. The winner was . . . Halliburton/Brown  Root. The company continued its work in Bosnia uninterrupted.  ….  New details are emerging that suggest the energy giant Halliburton did not overcharge the Defense Department for fuel in Iraq  contrary to the claims of critics in Congress and in the field of Democratic presidential candidates.  The Pentagon is investigating allegations that Halliburton overcharged it by $61 million for gasoline and other fuels delivered to Iraq. Halliburton delivered gasoline to Iraq from Kuwait at a price of $2.27 per gallon, while it delivered gas from Turkey for $1.18 per gallon.  ….  But why did the Corps specify that fuel be delivered from Kuwait? The answer appears to lie with the nature of fuel shortages that swept Iraq in the late spring. After the war, the country’s oil refineries were operating far below capacity. Both gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas, which millions of Iraqis use for cooking, were in very short supply.  American officials feared that the shortages might spark civil unrest. Of particular concern was Basra, the city in southern Iraq that had seen increasingly violent expressions of popular anger against coalition forces. According to a source in the Corps of Engineers, in May, Lt. General Ricardo Sanchez, leader of American forces in Iraq, demanded that fuel be supplied to Basra  fast.    If you are still reading, congratulations, and go read the whole thing.  If not, then I’m wasting my time and I’ll stop here.  If prompted, I’m prepared to debate this with Eric or anyone else.  I ENJOY this, so bring it on.
