Probably my number one least favorite teacher is a guy named Mr. Wright.  Take his actions last week for example.  "Sorry about this, but I am required to teach you guys how to write a college level research paper.  Seeing as how we only have 2 weeks left of school, I think it is a good idea I spring this on you now.  I don't know what I want from you guys yet, but go ahead and get started, I might feel like coming up with those details later."  Another one of my particularly distasteful picks would have to be my orchestra teacher, Mr. Kibler (Keebler).  He decided to let only the upperclassman on the computers in the room, and password protect the computer and give all the older kids the password, leaving us freshmen and sophomores with bull.  "I decided you guys aren't good enough to go on the computers, so I shut you all off of them.  When you guys have a study hall, you're just SOL."  It's not that he's a bad teacher, he's just freakin' annoying.  Now that I have had a turn to vent, I invite you all to share some of your annoying teachers with the rest of these great readers.
