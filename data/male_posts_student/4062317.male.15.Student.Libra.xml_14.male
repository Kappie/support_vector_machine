Although i only bought it to get my hands on last years game of the year Star wars: the knights of the old rebublic. Neways back to doom 3. This game is really freaky, the opening has u walking thru this base on mars with practically no light ( You would guess that by the time we could get to mars there would be some forms of lighting). But anyways as u are walking down this long set of rooms and partof the outside of mars u finally get to this room with a crazy scientist.  This guy babbles on about how he has seeen the devil and how he created a cage for him.  Then all of a sudden there is a warning and stuff just starts blowing up. Then all of a sudden these things start flying around the room and pass thru this scientist. Then remarkably he becomes a zombie and starts attacking u. its really freaky because at first u dont know wut the heck is happening to you.  As u progress back down the halls it gets freakier because u cand hold ur gun and light at the same time.  So when u put ur light on to see the zombies u can see them but as soon as u take out ur gun ur only light (your flashlight goes back into the big old inventory sack). Now u are shooting at a enemy u can barely see. This is really freaky. Luckly no one is black so u can see thier white heads.  So if ur looking for a really good horror game buy Doom 3  late,  Smog
