Anyway.  End of school.  Here. Now.  Having got a call from Mr. Brady.... probubly means I didn't get the job.  Unless I should wait for tommorow.... who knows.  The job isn't the most important thing to me, I'm pretty sure I'll fare well without it.  But finals, I hate studying, and I'm going to need to study this year for mucho clases porque Senora Pollack crea que giving muchos finals will actually accomplish something.  Why the hell does she have to get so involved in stuff?  I remember  Neutral Nation, talked about a boss has less productive workers if it (he/she) doesn't get involved with it's workers.  I'm starting to see why he said this.  I'm really uptight though.  I gotta start doing some of that heavy meditation stuff.  See if I can enter into a mental cocoon.  Maybe come to terms with how my mind is set up.  Yeah, I'm the Moderate Christian turned ultraliberal christian (even though I can't even conform to the Apostle's Creed to well.)
