Wanna see me get down on my knees? Wanna hear me begging baby please? Wanna see me crying for mercy Oh girl, I wish I knew your world I think Im losing my head over you girl  Every bone in my body says I want you tonight. Pretty little hunny, why you there by my side. With your Hale Berry face and you Beyonce thighs. With you Juxci want to collide  ? ? Bump all night long with you sexy little waist Come girl, come along, wanna make love to you from dusk til dawn  Well I know that it maybe too soon to know just what you'd like  But I wana know what you've been thru, what you want from life  Its so real the way I feel so true, this feelings so hard to fight  Wana now how you feel for me too, So you can become of mine  Babe you, leave me confused, Dont know if I should l let you know or wait it out girl, Wish I knew Just what to do Im so confused  [Repeat Chorus]  Well someone once told me that you'd end up lonely Dont let love ever pass you by Coz I've seen it happen to people that mattered to me with my very own eyes Maybe they were mistaken And I should be waiting, for you to show me a sign Or should I just let you know that if I let you go, Id wonder the rest of my life  [Repeat Chorus]  To be or not to be, that is the question I dont know what to do Im in a state of confusion All I want from you is your love and affection Is this love real or just an illusion?  [Repeat Chorus x 2]
