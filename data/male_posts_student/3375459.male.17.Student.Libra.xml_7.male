But I've got to stop the cards this 2 days because of work (Though I said i'm lazy to work, but its time I got out of my house le, so happy). I think by the day after tomorrow I'll be refresh and ready to start on the next card. =) here's the cards I did yesterday, more coming right up~ (Hopefully you guys will be able to view it, cause i've uploaded them to www.ripway.com this time round)   urlLink The Big   urlLink The Change   urlLink The Loop   urlLink The Maze   urlLink The Dash   (new)   urlLink The Jump   (new)   urlLink The Shadow   (new)   urlLink The Wave   (new)
