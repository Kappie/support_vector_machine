I was in a good mood, i went to taco bell, got some club chalupas, then went to the mexican supermarket and jacked some candies...hehe....B.A.K....Hhhanywayz me and leonard hung out the whole time basically...i sang the songs, he played it on the guitar...it was bitchen...we seronated alex with some john mayer..ooooooo shieeeeet...hhehe...it was tight...then at 7 the game started. The First game we lost 25-15...i felt that we were not gonna over come this at first, but i was determined to get an upset. Then we got back and won the 2nd game, 25-21, I got all stoked and i started to get all crazy...Then we lost the 3rd game 28-26, that got us kinda down, but we still had some left in us. Right off the bat, chris gets us 6 pts. on the 4th game and we ended up winning 25-20, i had many killz the whole night but my serves were like "eeeeeeeeeh"...So into the 5th and final game...it was back and forth the whole way, my heart was pumpin and i was tryin to calm myself down...then it was 14-13, one point away from victory...tom told me "charles hit a 3....ur gettin the set"...I was like aiiiight lets end this...then tom set the ball pretty low so all i could do was tip, they dug it up and played it out...i got a 2nd chance to hit, tom set it low again, but i tipped it into the right spot to win the match...it was one of the best feelings i ever had, i felt that we are finally got make somethin of ourselves this year...i actually felt...happy. It was the 1st time we ever beat santa barbara in history...it felt good to make history...i led the team with 14 killz and i had a few good stuffed blockz...so today was a good...very good day...lata
