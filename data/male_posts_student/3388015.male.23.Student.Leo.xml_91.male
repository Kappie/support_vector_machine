They lost the game.. the ump was a jerk, but it was entertaining at the very least.   urlLink    Aaron At Bat   urlLink    Aaron in a pickle...   urlLink    Nola, Bobby and I watching the game   urlLink    Aaron  Mom  After that, we came back to Riverside.  Bobby took us to a fastfood restaurant called 'In and Out' which surprisingly was VERY good.  They have 3 menu options, but they are very accomadating.  We hung out at the house for awhile until we left for Billy and Bobby's parent's house.  They live in a really nice neighborhood on top of this moutain.  They have this mineral water pool and this amazing house.  They cooked us a 6 course meal, which included tortilla chips and salsa from a local mexican restaurant (way too hot for me) and then cheeses and dip on crackers.. then seafood, a vegetable salad, garlic potatoes, steak and asparagus.  So much food.. I couldn't eat everything.  They also had this barrel of drinks.. I don't think I've drank that many calories in my life.  It was great, we got home around 1:30 am here, 4:30 back home.  Oi!   urlLink    Nola  I in the mineral pool
