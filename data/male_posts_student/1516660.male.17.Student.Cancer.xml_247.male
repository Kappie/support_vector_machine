This was not the surprising bit. The surprise was the site itself.  The site is a blog of their KL trip. They talked about their visit to Mid Valley. However, the main focus was not about their trip. It was to dispel what I have wrriten here a few days ago about them.   Actually, if I come to think about it, it was hardly a surprise. I was very calm when reading that. I predicted that when they see my blog, they would come to that kind of reaction. In a way, I was mentally prepared.   Wendy talked to them this morning, when I was sleeping. They came online and showed Wendy the site. Wendy said that only XC/Hann talked to her, the rest didn't. I won't post what she said, but she did say if i wanted to clear this misunderstanding, I should apologize for the wrong I did.  Yes. i am indeed in the wrong for few oscassions. Being a sleeping conductor, running into MPH without informing them, insulting WQ. Yes. I do admit I was wrong. I apologize for my misdoings.   However, some of the things they written in their blog (countering what I wrote) is twisted beyond the truth. I will give an example. On Wendnesday morning, I picked the spring onions out of my yee mee. The vendor saw it and then said in Cantonese, "Next time, if you don't want yee mee, you ccan tell us and we won't put". I replied with, "Oh. I didn't know that you got put spring onions in yee mee" in Cantonese. They wrote in the blog that I was trying to show off my Cantonese skill. I supposedly had a smug look on my face. I feel that they misinterpreted my actions. When someone speaks to me in Cantonese, I would naturally reply back with Cantonese. It's like a reflex action. I just did it.... I never thought about showing off my Cantonese skills (which was pretty average compared to the expert Cantonese, like my parents). Maybe the smug look was there because I tried to defend my actions. I certainly did not try to show off my Cantonese-speaking skills. If you actually observed me in some food situations, I picked out disgusting spring onions from my food and had a discussion with the vendors. This is me. The garnish hater.   Also, they claimed that I tried to break up Hann's family in my blog (refer to Wednesday's post). I had no such intention of doing so. I merely recorded my observations and my thoughts. How can posting my thoughts break up a family? I didn't even tell the Lais about what I thought. How can the blog "made the family drift away"? I am quite puzzled. Only Hann saw it.   One more thing. I did not go around telling everyone about the incident. I only told Wendy, and she already knew right from Day One. Benjamin pressed answers from me. I was only going to let him know after I posted my entries. I did not know whether it was Benjamin confronted them, or they confronted Benjamin. I was too busy talking to Wendy at that time to care. From what I could see (being invited into conversations), I observed that Benjamin confronted them. Perhaps I only saw a small portion of it and made a wrong judgement. I apologize if I did.   I observed that they convienently left out some things which I wrote, which were the most crucial. Things like "too much jokes hurt", "I was being treated like an extra". They said that I took their jokes too seriously, and I was too emotional, for they were only joking around. I think that they cannot counter these statements. That's not the point. When will they ever get it into their heads that jokes are never meant to be be overused. Yes, one or two jokes are fine. They are funny. The humor stops when the jokes are being used past their limit. The jokes became critcism to the receiver. They became "bullying words". I seriously think they would realize that when their jokes killed somebody. There are records of people committing suicide because their friends "joked" too much. There are stories of such cases. If I stayed on and listened to their jokes, I would have blown up, or become depressed. I am not joking.   Sigh. What really is the use of posting all these in my blog? Why am I trying to clear up all these misunderstandings in my blog - publicly? As long as I know that I am in the clear for most of the things, that's enough. Right? This blog is somewhat considered my private journal. Having found that someone picked my thoughts and feelings and critsized them, I was quite hurt.  Right. Enough about the unhappiness. Let them out, and I would be fine. Today leh, nothing much happened. I brought a Yu-Gi-Oh card deck for myself. I am planning to collect cards, more than playing. :) Crazy cat me.  Hmm...nothing else happened le la. Just surfing of sites here and there. Heh.  I think I end this blog le. Oh yes, I would like to mention that I have complete faith in CQ. Okay, see ya tomorrow. Oh yeah hor! Tomorrow's Star Awards! I might be blogging in the afternoon! Night blog! ~Hums Star Awards Tune~
