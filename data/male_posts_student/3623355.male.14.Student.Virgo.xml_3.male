They were up in their room, and i was in the downstairs hall on the computer. I heard my mum shout something like 'no andy, u cant do this 2 me and the kids! you cant leave!', and then that night my dad bought us pizza and we watched casulty, and then after that he told us. Everyone else was crying except me.  Then, we had already paid for the flights to my dads aunts villa on the costa del sol , so we were going on holiday. by this time, my dad had broken up with the first girl he was having an affair with, and was now going out with his 2 present girlfriend lisa (i 'll get to her in a min).   then, we had had a nice day at the pool, and we went to the beach and we had had dinner out and me and my brother were in our bedroom. My sister was asleep in my mums bed, me and law had our own room to share, and my dad was sleeping on the sofa. So it was about half 10 at night, and my dad had finished on the phone with lisa. he came in and started telling my mum about how she was being beaten up and stuff. then my mum started crying and i didnt hear what she said. then i heard my dad shout 'stop it stupid cow' and i heard him slap my mum. i'll never forgive him for that.  now, lisa is a bitch. shes 34, which is 5 years younger than my dad, has 2 kids, natalie and louie who are 14 and 10, they are sooo spoilt u wud not believe. and my dad takes it.  they bought a £400,000 BUNGALOW in borehamwood, hertfordshire, which has got 3 rooms, a crappy bathroom and a kitchen, hoping to build it up into a 5 bedroom house. yeh rite.  then they bought a dog, molly, which is stupid because they cant even look after their own house let alone a dog. I mean, natalie wont let my dad get anything proper (like a collar) because it 'isnt fashionable and i wudnt take the dog out' (honestly shes a cow).   i cant be bothered to write any more at the moment.. i mite go speak 2 connexions on da net or sumfin.  tlk l8r  james xx
