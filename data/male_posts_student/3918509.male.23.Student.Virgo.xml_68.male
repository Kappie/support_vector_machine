That's right, Mr. Kehr for the People of the State of Michigan vs. Naughty Drunk Driver Man.  I'm clerking/interning with my local Prosecutor's Office this summer and this will be my trial debut and it should be fun and challenging.  I've worked up a great opening statement though, so I think I'll have the jury from the start.  There is something of an entrapment issue in the case, which is really going to be fun, but I am going to try and nip that right in the bud with a motion right before trial.  Anyway, if you guys read this tonight or tommorrow (Thur, Aug 12) send a little prayer up for me and I'll let you all know how it goes.  J-Roc
