Next Sunday however I shall be venturing on a free trip to Chessington World Of Adventures, all paid for by the good people at LWT. Free use of the park will be good, especially when i think that im denying other people the chance to go ;). Just think of all the ITV stars I might bump in to. I know that your still thinking, I couldnt come up with any either. Anyway, If only I had BBC3, I could be Monday-proofing meself now, but i guess im just not going to be smiling in the rain tomorow morning. See ya!
