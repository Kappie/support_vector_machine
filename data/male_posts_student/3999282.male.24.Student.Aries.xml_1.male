I bought a boxer today using my new debit card at Sears. I was really happy while I was giving my debit card to the clerk. I pressed the wrong button while dialing (chequing account instead of saving since my old debit card is saving). Anyway, I will try to use my VISA some other day....   I Watched Bourne Supremacy with my bro this evening. It is a pretty good movie, because it is free!?  Anyway, I will try to do some readings now and hope I can finish the chapter by this weekend
