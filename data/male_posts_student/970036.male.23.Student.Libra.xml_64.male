Nicole and I are thinking of checking out  The Distillers  down in Cow Town on May 23, and it'd be rather corking of you if you had an extra couch or two.  Then again, seeing as how it's not actually  your  house, you might want to okay it with the rightful owners. Or, OR!, you could arrange that they have some sort of "accident" thus enabling the two of us to share accommodations with you.  Brilliant!
