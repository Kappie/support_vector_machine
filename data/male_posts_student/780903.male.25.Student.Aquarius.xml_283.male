Regardless of how I did, I can't think of anything I can possibly write about them in a non-anonymous setting besides:  1. The paper should be thicker.  It's no fun to open the envelope and already be able to read through the back and see what it says. 2. They shouldn't do it on a Friday, because you get all weekend to digest without enough distractions. 3. They should give back model answers when you get grades, so you can at least try and make the grades all make appropriate sense, good or bad.
