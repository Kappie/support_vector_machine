I'm sorry, everyone, I know everyone guiltily admits to watching it, and sometimes I watch it, but I'd prefer to be bored intellectually than being bored stupidly. I'm sorry... please don't kill me.  I know that the way to get to teenage females' hearts is to be slightly rogue-ish, and a bit typical-blokey. But, I can't do that, and I am saying this for a reason - It's to try to excuse what I'm about to say. I watch the news at the moment and I cry. If no-one understands why I cry when I find out that over 100 Iraqi citizens were murdered (some cases far beyond any hope of recognition) by people who are against an invasion, I'm living in the wrong bloody world. If you've read/heard my lyrics to the NJAN song 'Peace' you'll understand that it affects me a large amount... I know it's typical me but it's so bloody senseless. You wonder why I'm depressed a lot? It's not just things directly involving me that make me depressed.  Perhaps this isn't a reasonably set-out argument. It's not meant to be. This is me getting this out, so that if the news comes on when I'm with you and I rush off to the toilet, you don't think I have bowel problems.  Love, Jon Roskilly
