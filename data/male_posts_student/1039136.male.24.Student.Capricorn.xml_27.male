Your own brothers are sick and tired of hearing it too..3 words for you about life..it goes on..Get over it.  Put that in your fucking profiles.  Maybe then someone may actually feel bad for you.  It has been over a month already, i've seen people get over the fact that their wives left them in less time.  If you're crying cry away..i'll be enjoying life, drinking some beer, and having fun as usual.  I am flattered however that I'm on your mind this much.  So Dave, Mark...whoever..thank you for making me feel damn special. To conclude this section of my public service announcement for anyone still whining about it is:"Cry me a river, dickwad." Let bygones be bygones..suck it up.    Anyway..oh there goes my alarm..as usual though I woke up minutes before it. I don't feel much like packing right now..but who is ever excited about packing to go back to school anyway?  THe AGONY OF PACKING... "How do i fit all of this in my car?" "I cant believe i have to leave this beer behind" "I don't want to carry all this damn stuff up the stairs!" "You mean i have to go OUTSIDE when its still light out?" "How can I pack this so it doesnt get wrinkled?" "Should I take both of my pillows?" "Take the coffee pot, or leave it?" "MY LAUNDRY STILL ISNT DONE"  See its not easy being in college..so many tough problems to solve..lol now if that isnt sarcasm, i dont know what is.  I went to the woodlands last night..had a great time with Sarah, Ray, Mr. Cella and ESU PD officer Volch.  Had 2 new drinks...a gatorade(lime vodka and 7up) and a jolly rancher(Peach Schnapps and cranberry). Normally I wouldnt get sissy drinks but given that it was happy hour(for 3 hours)..they put bottom shelf liquor in their drinks so anything where you could taste the liquor was terrible to drink.  I just turned to my left and saw my boot which got some jolly rancher on it because some ignorant ass girl kicked over 2 of our drinks, which weren't in her way, and i stepped in that..and spilled some stuff on my shoe too cuz i had to hold other people's drinks AND try to drink my own at the same time..while being half in the bag. Later on they bought me some shots of something..and then we left...I couldnt even feel the cold when i left.   Today I actually left the house before the sun was setting...and the sun burned my eyes! AHHH..no more..must go back to darkness.. enough of what i did..that gets boring to read..not saying anything else doesnt..but if you dont like it..dont read it!  Coming soon to WB: Club Underground..the newest indy music/wrestling venue. God only knows what kind of fun thats going to bring. Congrats to Joey and his right hand man Brad for bringing this together and bringing back our underground family.  I'm not going to spill anything else about that because I think the fans should be in suspense...  I'm too tired to pack....but i guess i have to. So i'm going to stop writing now...less than one day before the madness of college begins again..cant wait!
