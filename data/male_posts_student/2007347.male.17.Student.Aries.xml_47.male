There has been no more sightings of Stephen Meet of late, It appears that he has caught wind of my operation and skipped town, That or he was only there as a one off thing. Could it have been Danny Fish, we may never know. Maybe its a sign from the Great Simon Penis, BTW the cult site is up, so if you want to see it its there, and there is a random section called the voice, which is just *.WAV files of me saying stuff. I love my Site.
