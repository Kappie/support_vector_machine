Now I have nothing to do, the one thing I enjoyed most was band practice but now we are going on a break…I forget why….now I got nothing going, so I sit on my ass not feeling like doing anything…I called Ben to see if he feels ready to practice yet, and he wasn’t home yet, and his sister said she would tell him.  This isn’t the first time I left a message for Ben and I never got a call back…in fact there are more times that I never got a call back then when I did get a call back.  Whose fault?  I have no idea…but it is fucking stupid.  Now Marty is being a jerk, I asked if he could call Ben  cause I didn’t want to pester him, but “that would mean he would have to get up to get the phone”…god…sometimes I don’t feel like I got anything to live for, well, ever since Ben decided to take this break….I got a lot of math, and biology…DAMMIT I hate Richardson soooo much.  Sometimes I just want to yell out in her class, “BOOOORING!!!!!”  She just drones on and on and on, it drives me insane, and I can’t sleep cause she yells at me.  But I guess I am happy cause X-mas is coming…  Not really…I don’t want anything, if I could have anything it would be for Just For You to plan something, and then actually follow through with it…all that happens is pushing back, pushing back, pushing back…..  Oh and a girlfriend would be nice, but whatever…  Oh yea, and this is gonna be my first Christmas with a broken home…many tears to come…  Merry fucking Christmas…  "I hate everything, fuck you." -suicide machines
