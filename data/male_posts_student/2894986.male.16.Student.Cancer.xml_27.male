Starting the moment I got home from school on Friday, I never really had a free moment.  The dance was on Friday night and I had to get a shower and be out the door in time for me and Steve to go pick up our dates and get to the restaurant. The dance was, to my surprise, a lot of fun. You should have seen me get my groove on. Or maybe not. But the fun didn't stop there. On the way home the van ran out of gas just before the Smyrna exit. It took about 25 minutes for mom and dad to come get us and then we headed over to Steves.  After a few hopurs of sleep on Friday night, I had to wake up at 8 to go ref some soccer games. It was jsut my luck that Hector had rescheduled his game for 10 o'clock in between the two other games I was reffing. We ran behing all day and I was spent by the time my game started. To top it off, it was completly cunny and 85 degrees. The sunscreen sure did work though. We went on to win our game 4-2. Then we headed home for about 30 minutes until we headed out to Nelson County for the U-19 game. I wouldn't even call this one a game. We won 14-0. I had 2 goals. Then, I got to eat for the first time in 24 hours, when we ate before the dance. I didn't think it was possible to be as tired as I was by the end of Saturday.  Then it was Mothers Day. It was a nice day. Sunny and hot again. We gave mom her presetns and helped her fill her birdfeeders. Wow, was it hot. After i fixed tuna fish for lunch, I headed out to ref three more games. These were actally entertaining though. The U-11 girls i reffed were better than half of the players on my team. The heat was unbearable but I earned $62 on top of the $47 i got the day before.   The busy days continued today, moms big 50th birthday. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM. I reffed more sooccer games today, and I have some on Tuesday and Thursday. It doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The end of the shcool year is coming up and exams will be upon us soon. Maybe summer will bring the needed releif. Hopefully a trip to Egypt and dozens of dips in the pool will be a relaxing change. I will keep looking for that. Until then, If you would like to donate your time to help, just let me know. Hope your weekend was as fun, but not as busy as mine. Thats all.   Everyone should check out the Sunday  B.C. . It say's goose. And anything that mentions geese is funny.
