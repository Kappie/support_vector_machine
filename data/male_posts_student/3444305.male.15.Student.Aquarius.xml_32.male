So after my last day of being a leader at Vacation Bible School my dad said I could pick where me and my brother wanted to go out to eat. So I decided Burger King. Well we got there and I'm like you know what, I can get this cheaper at Mcdonalds. So I go back to the car and tell my dad to go to Mcdonalds. So I get into Mcdonalds and I'm struck by a guy with no shirt on. I felt really disgusted. It's not the fact that he didn't have a shirt on, but it was because he was in Mcdonalds ordering food without a shirt on. And I look on the door, and it says "No shoes, No shirt, No Service" And i'm like oviously they arn't keeping up to that. So I order my food with this nasty guy with no shirt on next to me. I get it and walk out as fast as possible. So I'm really disgusted right, so I find the Mcdonalds Comment line on my bag. So my dad told me to give it a call, so I whip out my cell phone and give Mcdonalds a call. And tell them how disgusted I was. The guy is like yeah, that's not our standards, and he took my name and address and all that. So hopefully they get me something free. I know thats buying me off, but I don't care, its free at least. Maybe I should call the health deparment too, because our Mcdonalds got a 100% on there inspection, and oviously, that shouldn't be happening. But hopefully I'll get something free. You're nasty Mcdonalds. Well, that's all I had to say.
