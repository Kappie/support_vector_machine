I remember elementary school at Santiago Hills and really enjoying being out in the field on a windy day. The wind would always be coming from the eucalyptis trees (which were originally planted by the Irvine Ranch as wind breakers). It was always a lot of fun walking toward the trees and feeling the air around surround me.  Today I was sitting on a bench waiting for the bus and it felt nice feeling the air.  I managed to pick up a big stack of books today from the library. I need to get a bunch of reading done today. I hope to get through Hegel and Eco today.  In regard to blogs... I'm always impressed by  urlLink Doctor Frank  from the  Mr. T Experience 's blog. He writes pretty long essays about all sorts of things for his blog, and relatively consistent at that. Speaking of Dr. Frank, I wonder if Suzanne knows about his solo shows next month in LA?  I wonder if I should put more thought into my blogs?  Sometimes I get political and sometimes I get... dare I say... emo... in my blog. I'd like to think that in the endless ramble, there's something significant and worth saying.  **
