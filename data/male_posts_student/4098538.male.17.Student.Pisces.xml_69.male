I spent all of yesterday and today building a website -  urlLink www.blindedbyfear.esmartguy.com . It's my first proper site and I'm pretty proud of it, even though it's nothing special. I also took some more photo's of random crap around and about my house to put on my Flickr account. I think my photography is going pretty smoothly too. I'm no expert, but I'm happy with it. Anyway, I dunno what else I can write, so go check out my site and leave a comment =)
