And that now makes me older than Dickybod, but not megatrobe, deutsches or nonnesuch. I recieved a few DVDs, namely the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which are fantastic films, as well as Matrix 1 and 3, also excellent films. I already had Matrix 2. I shall take this opertunity to say that Revolutions is worth seeing if only for the final Neo vs Smith fight scene - perfectly done. Also got a new radio alarm clock for my bedroom, as the last one kept going out of tune for no apparent reason. Oh, and I mustn't forget the last present. 'Twas a set of pencils from WH Smiths. I needed some more pencils...  I have also been to see 'The Day After Tomorrow' at the cinema, which was on Tuesday, which I think was a pretty good film. Had some good mass people dying scenes, as well as New York getting totally buggered. That was probably the main reason I went to see it. To see New York destroyed. Definately worth it. Finally, I saw 'Harry Potter 3' earlier today, which was... fairly good. About what I was expecting. It's been a while since I've read the book, so I can't really compare it. I don't think they left anything too major out... generally a good film.  And I have been doing some revision. Mainly biology and geography, as they are what I have on Monday. Did a few practice bio tests, which I did ok on, not great though. I should probably revise it more.   Reading:  Guards Guards  Listening to:  Burly Brawl  Watching:  The Day After Tomorrow, Harry Potter 3, Distraction and Have I got news for you tonight.   Confused about:  Biology, maybe  Annoyed with:  My computer, it's buggering up again.  Mood:  Ok.
