Here is a snapshot:   There is a workshop on advertising on at this time conducted by a person from Ogilvy  Mather. The response to it has been quite good.  There is an Institute party (or 'Insti party') tonight in view of completion of our exams. Normally, such parties go on till 4-4.30am with a lot of liquor served. But since tomorrow is our Independence Day (a dry day), liquor serving will stop at 12 midnight today and the party will end at 1am. I haven't attended two earlier such parties since I think I won't have anything to do there. Instead I have spent good time watching some good movies on the computer.  The directors of the six IIMs are here at IIML to follow up on their meetings regarding fee structure. And as it has appeared in the papers today, they are actually talking about a fee hike! What a reversal from just a few months ago!  There is an Entrepreneurship workshop tomorrow conducted by Mr. Akash Sethia. I will be attending that. It promises to be very interesting.  Following this workshop, there is a talk on entrepreneurship to be delivered by Mr. Mahesh Murthy, advisor to many big corporations and familiar to us from his column in 'Businessworld'.  There is a teleconference session on Wednesday with Mr. Vikram Gopalakrishnan, head, private banking, Deutsche Bank, and an IIML alumnus. He had come here a few weeks ago to deliver a talk and this teleconference is going to be for hardcore finance students. It will be on popular market instruments, derivatives etc.  The 'Operations Interest Group' has come up with a good project. It is the renovation of the canteen ('Thapa's') here. It includes things like making of proper accounts for the canteen, streamlining procurement and other such things.
