Connor is not one of those noisy babies that cry all the time, no he is quiet mostly. Except for when he is hungry, overly bored/tired, or smacks himself against something. Yes, this kid is great at beating himself up; you know how it is... walking babies are a wreck waiting to happen. Once they think they have got the hang of it, they confidently run around in what appears to be a drunken stupor... wobbling  about with a constant lack of balance. Eventually, they are bound to smack right into a wall or completely lose balance and fall onto something one would not want to drop all of their weight on to. Just today... Connor is busy jogging about with no particualur aim or destination in mind, and BAM!!! right into the dresser. Not only that, but he then swings around and smacks himself into the a wooden bunk bed frame just three feet away. Its almost humorous to watch him bouncing himself off of bedroom accessories like a pinball in a  Furniture Land  pinball machine. This is common occurance for him; he quickly recovers and is off again looking for further ways to inflict personal injury.
