(or personal arse-hole, as Micky calls it) to DJ Micky B, I basicly do all the heavy bits and let him focus on the hard stuff. First gig last night was awesome. I learned the ropes, then hung out at the quietest laid back 18th bday ever, and met the loveliest of birthday girls :)  I managed to 'win' a race last friday, a  urlLink intra-club  team time trial, riding with many of the 'gentlemen-racers'. It was a success, there were loads of kids up there, and we all had a good ride (albeit caked in mud from the wet road surface).  Last Thursday was cool. Got our AS levels back, and got very drunk, and just had fun with most of my mates. This weeks advice, don't drink anywhere near girls under the age of 17, as the bar staff get really uptight.  Sorry about the diary effect, but this way I won't forget everything too soon.  Listening to: 'Ghost man on third' by Taking Back Sunday.  Emo, neh?  xxxx
