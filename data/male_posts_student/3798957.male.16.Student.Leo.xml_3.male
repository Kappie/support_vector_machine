During all the associated lines before that, we were trailed closely by a woman and her baby. This instilled an early feeling of dread in my soul, because as everyone know, plane rides with babies are not any fun at all. Especially for me, because I  really  don't like children of any age. I was right of course, as the damned thing set up it's wailing almost on cue as we hit cruising altitude, and never stopped. Why does it have to be that the first thing to work good in kids are their lungs? Anyway, I stumbled out of the plane when we touched down in Chicago, where we were switching planes. There was  another  fucking baby on board this one. In fact, I'm pretty sure that of each of the five planes I rode on this trip, each one had at least one wailing child on board. I was not a happy camper, to say the least. The baby from Chicago to Grand Forks, ND provided some modicum of amusement at least. It was seated right behind me, not the amusing part by any means, but the interaction between it and it's mother was interesting. Apparently it had a bit of an obsession with hair, because at several points during the trip, the mother's voice would cut through the screams to inform it that, indeed, it  had  taken hold of mommy's hair and was hurting mommy. Every now and then these proclamations would be followed by a squawk and then renewed noise from the beast, along with "you see? That hurts, doesn't it! That's what you're doing to mommy." This made me smile because I knew that pain was coming to a creature whose existence displeased me. My elation was dimmed somewhat when I glanced behind me and saw the thing's eyes fixed on me, grubby paws extended and grasping feebly. I felt rather disgusted at the prospect of having the damnable thing sieze hold of my bare arm suddenly and then enduring the contempt-filled gazes of an entire plane as I immediately wrenched the hands away. The contempt wouldn't be so bad, I deal with that on an almost daily basis. Anyway, my family(the standard complement, a mom, dad, and brother.) and I arrive at the Grand Forks airport, where a local aunt comes and drives us to Valley City, home of my grandma. I have never met this aunt, nor heard mention of her that I can recall. While this may have worried most people, it doesn't faze me because I'm rather used to family cropping up unexpectedly. See, my grandma had 13 kids, including my dad, and most of them are also married with children, perhaps even grandchildren in a few cases. My mom's side of the family is comparatively much smaller, but with both of them combined I have the most cousins this side of Arkansas. Hell, I've got nephews, and I'm 16. But I digress. Over the hills and through the towns, to grandmother's house we went. Approximately halfway there, we stopped for gas and I bought a box of Krispy Kremes. We had an April Fool's day prank where someone put up a billboard proclaiming the arrival of these in our neck of the woods, Anchorage, Alaska if you've forgotton or didn't check, but this was the first time I'd actually seen them. Later that night I put a few in the microwave, and hot damn were they tasty. My aunt also spilled gasoline all over herself. This could be considered a bad thing, since she smokes. Thankfully, no immolation occured and we merely drove several miles crammed in a car with her fumey self. We got a warm reception at grammy's house, picked out bedrooms, and slept. I bet you're all pretty damn entertained, eh? I'll recount some more tantalizing tales for you later.
