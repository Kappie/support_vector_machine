Protesting is one thing, but putting your life in danger to try to protest is another.  A strict investigation is underway means dick to me.  People stand in front of a huge bulldozer driven by a person that doesn't really care if you are in front of him or not.  Seems like a no brainer.  What do you think should be investigated here?  Possibly the intelligence of people in front of a bulldozer, shouting stop, instead of getting out of the way.  I truely do not think that stopping a building from being dozed over is worth the life of that individual.    Please do not tell me that this is what it takes to be heard.  Please do not tell me that this is the side of war we do not see.  That driver and that girl were not at war with each other, if so, she would have pulled a 9mm out and capped his ass.  She committed suicide from what I can tell.  She made a decision that what she was protesting was more important than her own life.  That is tragic, but that was not war.  The only people who truely see war are the people who fight them.  Everyone else sees what a blogger/news anchor/photographer/etc.. try to capture in a small sample of what that war is.  I am sure that on many points I have mentioned, that I might be wrong.  My opinions are only based on what I have read and heard, the same as the opinions you are making right now, about what you just read.
