Now still on the post recovery stage of flu and headache. It kinda sucks, especially since I had to miss the leaders meeting with Pst Kong last night. I was practically immobilized on my bed sniffing and coughing... Oh well, there are two very good news PstKong shared with the leaders, which I think is not open to the rest...yet. =) But it's kinda exciting.. and hmmm.... not knowing what to expect?? =)
