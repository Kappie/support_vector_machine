But Darrel who sits beside me would always just say that I'm a sentimental person, just because I look out of the window and write letters in class. He's like always trying to find out what I'm thinking about. But I haven't told him anything though. Thanks anyway for your concern Darrel. (although he doesn't visit my blog.) So I'm some emotional person. Well, they say I am. But if I am that super-sensitive a person, wouldn't life be devastating? Maybe I am, but I think there's always another personality to cover things up. But I enjoy life. Maybe not so much this year. Always bring me back to realise myself in my adolescent years, where changes takes place. I don't know how I'll change, but my life is God's I will remember. Well,  today was kinda ok. It's just the same everyday. But today I didn't finish my work so I had to worry, which turned out to be waste of my energy, cause non of the teachers went through the homewrok. Then, I got back my English Comprehension. Argh...I got 12/25. I hate the new 'O' level format. It's like only 10 people in my class passed. This is crazy. Guess I just have to learn to get used to the new marking scheme. I can't wait for History lessons to start again. But I guess it'll be a long time before we start, since they'll be little lessons next week due to the moving of school. But that's exciting too. Either way, History is still my favourite subject. Well, Geography is ok...just that there's occasional "boring spells". Today's temperature is 36.86 degree celsius. I wanna go home!!! I need to be 37.60 and above to go home. But I guess I should be thankful for my good health. OK...I'll be back tomorrow!!!
