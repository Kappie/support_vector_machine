They wanted to have a "fancy meal" today, but they seem to think that being fancy also means being an asshole. My brother has been a jerk since he turned 13 two days ago. My parents are acting the way they do when they're stressed out. They get pissed off at you for not having a "fancy" glass, but when you point out that the style of your glass is completely trivial, they act like they didn't do anything wrong.  I tried to sit through the new Lord Of The Rings DVD we bought, but it's 3 hours too long.  I just kept thinking about how irritated i would get when a LOTR fan would start an arguement that Ints aren't trees. "They look like trees!" i would say. They reply "But they talk!"  "Yeah, but they said it in the movie, they were trees with something in them that made them grow tall and be able to talk and move."  "But... but... they're not trees. They're Ints."  And, depending on whether it's a guy or girl i'm talking to, this line is added.  "Shut up."  I'm serious, that arguement has happened a total of 3 times. It's almost as bad as when a Trekkie asks you whether you think a Klingon Bird of Prey would win against a Sovreign class Federation ship with 3 phaser banks and 5 photon torpedo bays. To that, I break their glasses.  I enjoy Star Trek, Especially TNG and Voyager, but I have a serious question to all the people who actively ponder whether Kirk or Sisko would get his ass handed to him in a fistfight:  "Have you ever created/done anything PRODUCTIVE because of your addiction to Star Trek?"  Debates don't count.  I'd say about 90% of the time if I asked that question, i'd either get a "No," a semi-witty remark followed by a disgusting laugh, or they would go off on another topic.  The other 10 percent are the people working right now that have actually come up with a plausible theory in which a Transporter may be possible. The people who are working to end starvation, and unite the world. The people who left for the army and left the rest of us the hell alone!  Still, though, not to be a hypocrite, I could discuss the philosophies of the Blue Man all day. I could act like one, I've memorized "Paint Drumming" and could actually do it if i could get 2 snare drums and some paint. I'm working on being able to catch marshmallows and junk in my mouth.  I'm not sure what the point of this is, but it sure was more interesting than those crap stories at the play on saturday! I'll think of the point I was trying to make after i get my head together, I got distracted that 2 of the notes in my PVC can be used in the PVC IV song. :-D
