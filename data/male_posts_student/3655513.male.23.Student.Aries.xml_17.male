I suppose this is supposed to appeal to the traditional attendees of the stampede by bringing back mental imagery of the old west, or the wild west or whatever, while appealing to a newer, younger, hipper audience by adding the word "new" to the title. (Honestly, it's amazing what one word can do to our perception of something!) While I was standing in line for Ralph Klein's stampede breakfast on Monday, my boss made an incredibly astute statement that has stuck with me through this week of cowboy madness in my current city of residence. Kirk (my boss) said that "six-shooters had been replaced with cell phones and PDAs as the weapon of choice in the new west". Wow. How true that is. We no longer need to take lives and kill to settle our disputes and quarrells, now we buy and sell and merge and deal and dally and whatever else. However the final effect is the same. Lives are changed for better or for worse and people either prosper or suffer. Perhaps this west isn't so "new" after all...  So in the following few days, aside from my bout with some sort of cold, (which I am now firmly convinced was brought to me by my roomate who works as a shipper/receiver for a furniture company. Yes I am totally certain he imported some form of rare virus to my bedroom) I have been observing the going-ons of Calgary during this, my second, stampede.  Stampede breakfasts are the event of choice to participate in for most. For the uninitiated, a stampede breakfast (or lunch in some cases) occurs when a business or service decide to host either a public or private meal for everyone to come and have food and fellowship at. Breakfasts traditionally cater pancakes (among other breakfast staples like sausages, etc.) and lunches usually entail some sort of dead animal on a BBQ. (Preferably beef or pork so I've been told) Having attended 4 stampede breakfasts this week, I'm constantly amazed at the willingness and good intentions of local (and international) companies in Calgary and the effort and obvious money put into giving people free food, just 'cause it is Stampede week. This morning I went to the breakfast hosted by Shell Inc. (the oil/gas company) and there were no less than 2000 people there being cattled through lines at fully catered breakfast tables. Country music being D.J.ed and even bales of straw to sit on. I have never seen another city (for a week and a half at a time no less) willing to divert from routine for one event. Roads closed, businesses shut or on odd hours, and people willing just to do anything to get involved with the stampede. There is a window-painting business here in town that does nothing but paint temporary murals on store-front windows. I spoke to an employee there, and apparently 96% of their business comes during the stampede. They paint murals of cowboys and horses and the such in large business windows, and practically go on holidays for the rest of the year. And they make PHENOMINAL cash doing it too. I'm talking like $50,000 a year for a grunt with an airbrush and a stencil that only works 1 day a week aside from the month prior to stampede.  All this to say that I am discovering more and more each day that I live in an extremely unique city, at a point in time where it is nothing but advantageous for me to be in Calgary. I've caught myself calling this city home from time to time too. Although part of me will always reside in my home province of British Colombia, and an even larger part of me in Ontario where I was raised for the majority of my life, Alberta is starting to look something I can say is a piece of me as well.
