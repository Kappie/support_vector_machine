Everything that I thought was true, everything that I just believed.....GONE OUT THE WINDOW!!! oh my god.  What the hell am I going to do?  Wow...talk about throwin' my mind for a loop.  I...never expected that. Next I'm going to find out that both of my recent girlfriends are druggies or sumthin'...OH MY GOD!!! I thought I was blind about the Tina thing....SHIT son.....I missed sumthin' even bigger..well, not more important....sumthin' probably even more obvious.  ...dang...  Alright, now that I have said that....but not even close to out of my system.  This must be what a mental breakdown feels like. Now...for most people...this probably wouldn't be such a big thing.  But I'm good little Mormon boy....I don't do anything wrong...well....ok, that's a lie.  But....SHIT!  just.....wow.  Just saw Spiderman 2 for the second time.  I really want to memorise that section of dialogue between Peter and his aunt.  That totally explaiins to everyone why on Earth I would ever hurt myself for others like I do.  **Namely Tina.**  I think I might have to talk to her again, this shit is too much to think through.    Damn...out.  Spense   FUCKIN' CHRIST!  This night just keeps gettin' better and better.  NOT! **Adult content in this blog entry...keep virgin ears away** translation:I'm gonna do a FUCK-load of swearing!  SHITFUCKASSFUCKSHITBITCHCUNTASSFUCKTARDSHITPENISCUNTRAGFUCKSHITHEAD! and that's only the beggining folks!  I just read Brittany's blog.  it said that Tina was "hyper happy" at the movie.  I asked her why.  She said that maybe Tina should tell me.  I convinced her to tell me anyway.  Cobian asked out Tina.  The NEXT FUCKIN' DAY AFTER I TELL TINA I HAVE TO MOVE ON, Cobian asks her out? Smell sumthin' fishy?!?!?! Cobian helped me come to that conclusion...after talking with him, I came to that conclusion. FUCKER!  It sure is fun bein' stabbed in the back.  I fuckin' help them anyway I can to try and get together.  I leave, the next FUCKIN' day, guess what happens? This is just too well timed to NOT be planned. FUCKYOUYOUASSFUCKINPIECEOFSHITEATINBUTTFUCKERCUNTRAGASSHOLE!  GODDAMNIT!  I've felt suicidal before...but this is the exact opposite.  I want to live on, but I want OTHERS to die....at my hands.  This is full-out homicidal.   Congratulations Cobian. fuck you.  Spense
