That sort of angers me.  Its not like i paid a whole lot for these, but the crackling takes away from the music experience.    Why do they crackle?  I'm not sure.  I never put them up too loud.. they are about at 20% of their full potential, all the time.  It never gets louder than that.  I don't over use them.  I use them when i'm on the computer, about 6 or 7 hours a day. Heh, maybe it is over use.  Maybe its the techno beats that i listen to.  Who knows.    One good thing about these speakers is that i can control the volume from the speakers, unlike my last pair, which you had to control from the computer.  I think, all in all, these speakers are pretty good, i love the bass that they give (with help from the subwoofer) and as long as you don't concentrate hard on the music, you can't hear the crackling.  Need to focus on something else....  Lates
