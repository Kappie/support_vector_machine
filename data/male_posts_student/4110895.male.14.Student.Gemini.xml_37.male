I agree that the group is getting a bit too big, but i think for now we should stay as one big group. i'm not going to mention any names up here. but seriously, some of you hardly ever say anything at Bible study - you're really going to get more out of it if you do ask questions, and you do share. You should know who you are.. I think our group has some issues to deal with before we split up into another group, and the only reason I can think of that's a good enough point to split the group up is that we're "uncontrollable" - which last saturday night disproved..we CAN focus, we just have to try. So try.
