Election day for Mayor is May 3, and over the past four months I talked with four people running.  And not only are these candidates approachable, they are the craziest bunch of politicians this side of Palm Springs.    Most mayors I know are pretty crazy, actually.  The list:   John Sampier, Rogers, AR  - I played soccer with his son, and both of us played in the high school band.  The Sampier household was *not* one of the nicest in Rogers, though it was a treat.  Sampier was not crazy in his dialogue (a very calm voice, much like Bill Clinton), but more in his actions, such as bringing a call girl to the Mayor's Ball back a few years ago.  However, Sampier made the best speech at my high school graduation...very short, concise, and not full of himself:  "Love everyone."   Leo Kopecki, Schulenburg, TX  - Leo is one of the focal points for my collaborative documentary  Lotto, Texas .  Only two of the past 20 years have seen Leo out of office in the  Gateway to the Rolling Hills .  And while Leo looks to spend most of his time at his convenient store rather than City Hall, his rapport with people and ability to sell Schulenburg is what keeps him in office.  Now if he could learn math...   Sonny Bono, Palm Springs, CA  - I didn't really know Sonny.  My grandfather renovated a few rooms in his house before he ran for mayor, though I do have a great shirt from Sonny's run for office in 1988 (Sonny Bono for Mayor.  It's time for a change!) that gets me into trouble when I wear it (Have you no compassion for the dead?!).  I did sell Mr. Bono a raffle ticket for a youth baseball league back in the late 80s; he didn't win.  And my family ran into him in Hawaii a few years later, his arms wrapped around large boxes of kodak film stock.  His forthright movements did not stop my dad from engaging Sonny in conversation, though.    And now, there is a good chance that I can add one of the four listed below to the list.  Well, one really, because how the hell could anyone else win?  The candidates I know, in alphabetical order (guess who is going to win)  1)   urlLink Leslie Cochran  - The most recent to my cabal of candidates, Cochran approached me today outside of Tower Records with a wink and a "Hello, Sailor."  Most folks in Austin know Cochran; how many drag queens run for mayor and do little else?  Anyway, I said I wished her the best in the race, and was glad to know that she had some sort of a platform (basically, stop government subsidies to businesses and to Keep Austin Weird).  She wanted to continue the discussion, but I'm only interested in the candidates as politicans.    2)   urlLink Jennifer Gale  - I can't find a picture, so this link to her only endorsement for an election ever will need to suffice.   But faithful readers will remember Jennifer under a different name:  Barry Bitch-Tits.  Yes, Jennifer Gale is everyone's favorite Meat Loaf lookalike, except she is also a cross-dresser, and takes a bit of hormone....but still pre-surgery transgendered.  I will say that she is the only mayoral candidate who laughs at The Fonz's shenanigans on Happy Days reruns.    3)   urlLink Marc Katz  - Every mayoral race needs a deli owner.  Katz's Deli never Kloses, and Marc can't help it he's gotta tell ya!  I ran across Marc on campus on Friday; he was at a booth answering questions at the West Mall.  I stood in line for a while, and when I got up there told him I loved the restaurant (who didn't?) and asked about local business protection in the wake of national industry needing to surface to create jobs (I can BS questions really good).  He BSed a good answer, and told me if I voted, to find him and he would give me a ticket for a free dinner!  I was so excited, I gotta tell ya, until I got a mass email for all of UT that said the same thing.  I don't have to vote for him, though.    4)   urlLink Will Wynn  - The lone city representative running for this office.  I met Wynn while a boom operator on a film shoot; Wynn was the keynote speaker at this Tree Day celebration, and while the people milled about, I stopped him and asked him about the city.  His information on the city was astounding, and his interest in civic organizations and the arts was a dream come true to this bleeding heart, bedwetting liberal (and to think he's considered the most conservative person in this race...that happens when you run against transvestites and the quirky all-night deli owner).  He holds endorsements from almost every city organization, and he reminds me of Dawson Taylor.    If you're interested, the most recent transcript of a debate is at the  urlLink News 8 Austin  website.    So who to vote for?  The guy who hit on me, the guy who I love to make fun of with Brian, the guy whose restaurant I adore, or the guy who wold make a good mayor?  Too bad I'm not registered in this city.
