For example, if you are having a bad day or have nothing to do, get pumped, then play the game like u aint got nothin to loose and call someone new. Now timing here is evrything, cause u have to get a hold of that person at the right time.  Lets see, in HS you really have to play the game like u aint got nothin to loose, becasue u really dont have anything.. no job, not much money, no wife, no kids, no taxes, nothing to do except playing the game like u aint got nothin to loose.   Or lets see we find Clay burrows in the Susan lindgrin parking lot like we have many a time before, we would have to get past the initial shock and actually make the situation into somehting that much better. for example, pull or a video camera and record it or picturaize it.  Pretty much, these rules of like are utility things that u should have memorized and should use because i really know that they will help your social, academic, sporting and sex life. trust me on that. so just use em cause thats why they're there
