But does eery girl circa my age have to lsiten to sucha  shit band withs uch pussy music, such average vocals?! Jsut becauser the lead singer is a chick (with the name of a hick) doesn't mean their the "geratest band in like history!" Let me get somethign straight  Their riffs are shit, their drummer si crap, their bass is the only decent sound. The songs are mirror images of one another with the sound variation being very minimal, the guys in the band are all gay. Their hooks are horrid, despite their lyircs being the best of the pop rock scene. This was a band made to appeal straight out to that 11-15 year old audience who are reaching or beginning puberty, have found an interest in guys and have been crushed. This is the basic ploy attempted by ALL their songs, with a sound that's limited at times to obnoxiously bad  guitar solos, they retrack some of their songs because their not skilled enough to go a full 5 minutes wihtout fucking up. Their CRAP. Thank you.
