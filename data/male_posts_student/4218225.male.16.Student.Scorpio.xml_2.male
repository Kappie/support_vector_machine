Ive been in kinda of a low point of life lately and I was starting to wonder if the enemies lies would give me an easy way out of what i was going through. I was barly holding on to my hope in people and my abilites in deciding who i am. But as the light of hope seemed to start to fade from me and i started to fall something happened, the light stoped fading and I found a Hand reaching to pull me back up. At first I refused the since of grabing the hand and letting the person pull me back to reason, but they still held out there hand waiting. That hand belongs to a friend and though i still feel as if the hole i was in is trying to bring me back in i remember that a friend showed me that i didnt need to be there and that even if things seem bad that i should still hold on to whatever hope i can. In this I found out that friends are not only there to hang with but to help you through things as well. Life is hard but it is so much easier when a person has true freinds as i have found that i do.
