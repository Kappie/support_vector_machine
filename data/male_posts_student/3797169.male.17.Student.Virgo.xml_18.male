I feel like the shithead who gets stuck in the little town and becomes sheriff and does nothing with his life.  Nar's goin' off to CSUN, I offered to drop her at the train station...not drop her, but take her there. She won't have it. Cam's at CC with me, but still, it's like everyone else is leaving. Son is off to Oxy, Lee is goin to some Lutheran type place in Minnesota or something, nothing's clear, everyone's leaving.  Well, that's not true. Not everyone is leaving. Some of the shitty people are sticking around. We call it getting Miked for a reason you know? JoJo is at the CC wit Cam and me, but it seems like the only classes she could have taken are things like Beginner's Photosynthesis Mechanics and shit, you know...the things only three people take becuase they have too.  Ah well. My schedule is fucked over too. Mon.-Thurs. I start at either 7 or 715 depending, and end between 930 and 1030. Damn, it's shorter than virgin sex! Wed. and Fri. I leave at 430 tho, what a bitch. But Friday is my film history day, and Cam and I will never forget the Van when it comes to film history.  We thought about takin english wit Van Leuven over winter, but he teaches 1a, and we've got that covered. It seems like the thing to do tho, just to piss Van off.  Oh well, that's enough for now...but maybe, just maybe I'll have some more for yah in a few minutes; if not, wait 'til tomorrow.
