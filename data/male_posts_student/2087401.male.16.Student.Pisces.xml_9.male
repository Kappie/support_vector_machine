All those people that I mentioned got crushed under a bunch of ice and died, as did I.  Zach *Smith survived.  We were ghosts at the church service, when I realized the since I had been upstairs during the accident, which made me turn solid.  So Zach, Heather and I, plus Ashley and some other girls, went to this studio place where the space shuttle had been repaired, according to a plaque.  A lot of other stuf happened, and the ghost came back to life via some unknown method devised by Zach *Dzuba.  Then there was a huge cyclone so we all went downstairs.  Then I woke up.
