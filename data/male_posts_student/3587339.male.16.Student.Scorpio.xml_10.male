Not that you really care.  even if you ever did accidentally stumble upon this you probably gave up by now.        have you ever thought what it would look like from God's pespective up there.  I'll bet he has a panel of buttons.  some for the sun, some for the moon, and one big red one entitled "SMITE"  that would be a cool way to live.  Franky is walking down the street.  He hits his toe on a piece of poorly poured concrete.  He mumbles behind his teeth "dam"  then suddenly before he can take another step  SMITE!   and blam franky is a pile of chalky substance on the cratered sidewalk.  That could make life pretty good.  you would be sitting at your office for example and you would see someone running down the hall with their hands over their head screaming "crap no i'm sorry, i'm sorry i didn't mean it it just slipp SMITE! "  a crash and tearing as the ceiling is ripped open and heavenly flames dash a hole through the side of the building.  Wow.  No that is not the way God works.  But for writing this i just might ge SMITE!
