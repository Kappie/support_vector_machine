Nothing much to be talked about, 'cept I'm beginning to loathe application questions. Lit Practical Criticism paper... I couldn't do like half the paper... :S Chinese. I could actually understand and do the comprehension and summary! THANK YOU GOD!  Had Math and Economics today. What a combination right? Both heavy papers together. Agh! Spent the whole of yesterday doing Math, only to find out that the paper was a killer. Didn't touch Economics except in the holidays and it was freakin' simple! Could have done it well if I ACTUALLY read through it yesterday... Grr!!!  That aside... I'm just lost now. Blur. So many things happening at once. I have to choose songs for worship for the next two weeks, AO Chinese Oral examinations are on Friday, My lit texts for Friday are untouched, my gosh. So many things on my plate.  I think I'll start studying only tomorrow. Hmmm...  Taxed to the max, Sherm
