Mhm, and it is asked why americans know so little of other cultures... i had to miss the model UN thing for it, so im doing my presentation next week....  ya know what? penises suck. cause ur trying to sleep, and theres this stick on your leg...ack. its sucky. lol  now, to explain my dreams...first. i was in my house, but in the front of my house was a dusty road with like..you know on drive throughs, how a thing from the main building comes over your head and and goes toi the ground, making a little passage for you? well, one of those. and a bunch of white CCC vans were going through, for mexico..so iw as sitting with some pajamas i ahd whnen i was 11..and i was trying hard to hide this..like..dildo woman. they had one in american wedding, so why not? lol...so iwas asking my dad to let me go back(i guess we'd been there the past few days, but this was a schoolday) and he said no..until i said i hated him and then explained a little more...so i went...and i was wlaking through this like Old Western town, except in the same location as Monte de SIon. and i was tlaking to juan and eating a cookie, and he said people had tlaked about 'the pig', me, while i was gone. in dreams, i always understand spanish fully. well then i was in tirane, albania(a really ugly, concrete city in a poor country in europe..its in one of my favorite books) and i was looking for uggs. my dad brought me purple ones, but i sort of didnt like them so i got bright blue ones instead. i didnt buy it tho...but som black guy from greece(he had a tag that said so) helped us....really odd.  I think the pig thing was because of brighton. since she snot eating. and thinks shes fat. ack. so it dawned on me i was fat or something? mhm, who knows. i just wish i had seen omyra in the dream. *masturbates*...just kidding. lol  aisha asked me the other day how she shoudl feel, just as i was leaving to sleep. i told her happy, cause she was perfect. i think it was a good answer. lol :)  next dream....with.nobody but..Brighton. mhm.  well it started out, i opened the door to our foyer(thats a funny word...i found out like a week ago that its like the entrance part of a house) for outside, and roya jumps out and runs like hell. so i expect her to stop at adams house, cause she did that once. she lieks his dog. but this time she ran really fast down the street, and i lagged behind her..so hilary duff came in a white van and opened the door, and roya jumpped in and they drove off. hilary duff had a blue butterfly shirt on. lol, i remmember that from her CD cover. so they went off...and i was like 'oh crap'. but suddenly i was back in front of my house, and my dad was like, lets go out. and i couldnt say no(i dont know why) so iw ent, nervously...and then we're out in a street that looekd like downtown ensenada, and i told him we were looking for a white van, but he guessed it was a truck i guess. so we see one, with Brighton, DJ and caitlin riding in it. and i see roya there too...so we follow...but we lose them...then we're back at the house.and i  see them going down on our pretty street.....just casually driving by. bitches. lol  anyways.....grandmas was fun...well, michael was. my abuela(not senile, mind you) has a horribly low tolerance level, so she got pissed at andrew, the 7 year old other cousin. i think hes mexican too..or maybe guatemalan. well, no matter, different dad from michael. we looked at pictures form the 70's..watched movies. i found out on friday my abuela grew up in south carolina for 2 years, after moving from NY. seems they followed her brother around in the army cause dad deserted them  horribly sad, especially for the 50's  in tech we watched a video of....Billy Joel um...lemme check. here....'we didnt start the fire'....it was a powerful thing, if u nderstood what he was syaing. not that pretty much anyone did. cause no one understood the events he talked about. see, he had been arguing with this younger person in like 1989, and the kid had said the msot important events in history were happening at that time. he disagreed and said his life had had important things. so the song is a long bunch of events with a chorus interrupting eveyr minute. and the events were horribly depressing...well, most. but the meaning was lost on everyone else. cause we watched this video some kid at caltech u. had put together of all the evnts as slides with the song as background....  mhm...then math...which was, as usual, funny. well, probably not for the rest of the class, but we had fun in the back corner. well, i did? lol  then free...once again, i talked to neena too long..then i did badly on an english quiz, which iw as supposed to have studied before during my free. then lunch...i had bad food, so i got a muffin..but i ate it all, and had a HORRID stomache ache during biology. he was late, so we almost had a free. the second half we just went outside and looked at plants and decided whteher they were..mono or di-something....during lunch i had to go to multi cultural club, wher ei signed myself up to write a blurb on malcolm X for some black history assembly in 2 weeks.  but id dont get it? are black people better than hispanics? hispanic heritage month was sept 15 to october 15th, but no one gave a shit then. so..whats up with that? are blacks more 'cultural' or something? lol  after school..i left my back pack upstairs...so then i ran like hell to model UN to say i couldnt present...then i ran back quickly cause melanie didnt wanna be the only 9th garder in the spanish meeting. so then i sat there, half dead....then afterwards, i went downstairs, then afterwards i had to go upstairs, after walking to middle school and back..and ack. it was shitty.'  it seems the boy im staying with in valencia, spain is an avid soccer fan. i hope i dont have to run that much. lol  i can do it, i guess. i beat mexicans at soccer in june, why not?  he also has visited mineesota once, on an exchange trip, and has good english. ehh...oh well. he's also a good student. but melanie said her girl sound slike a dork. lol..i dotn see it tho. the girl visits france often and is a good student..she lieks reading. i guess? not really. lol  jeez. ive been writing for 35 mins...well, what else would i do? this is better than sitting aorund without a purpose.   well, i gotta go. 3 30. time for home.  AHHH THIS IS THE BEST SONG. again. FRIJOLERO..   la fama que somos vendedores....de la droga que sermbramos..ustedes son consumidores....lol.. i love it. theyre talking about havinf fame for being crack-dealers. lol  Much love  peace  Hot stuff,   ~alex
