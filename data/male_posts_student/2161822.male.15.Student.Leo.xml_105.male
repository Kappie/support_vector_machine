I really dislike Angelfire. I get a webshell, and then they delete it for some reason. Now I get another one and the images don't even work. Now I'm just a big billboard for Angelfire with "Image hosted by Angelfire www.angelfire.com" all over my blog. Well screw that. Summer's almost here anyway. I guess I'll be occupied with Community Park and ice cream lol. As long as I don't get run over by cars. Stay away from quizilla.com too. It does major damage to sanity. ONE TWO THREE NIL! Oh sorry. Still obsessing over this CD. God it's so good. Go out and buy 10 copies of Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses on May 25th. It's well worth it. Along with basketball and such in the summer (you're still gonna die from what you said about the Barbie), I'll also enjoy playing music again. Should be a great time since me, Adam, and Evan started a band. Should be interesting since Adam now is gonna play drums and Evan is gonna play bass. Summer is looking good indeed. Now it's just the agonizing last few days of poop until freedom and joy.  Listen to H.I.M.
