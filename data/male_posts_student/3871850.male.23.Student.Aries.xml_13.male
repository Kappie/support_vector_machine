I mean they really very suay loh.. bo tai bo ji kena killed for nothing.. I always believe in this chinese phrase, "Shi Fu Bu Shi Huo, Shi Huo Duo Bu Guo" in other words it's means "If it's a blessing then it's not a disaster, if it's a disaster you want to escape also cannot." Haiz.. Anyway all lives are fated ba.. When it's time to go then you really need to go.. Who knows tomorrow what will happened.. To all my frenz out there.. pls take care especially those whom I really cherished alot one.. They should know who they are.. =p     In The End.. Its Only The Fittest Survive In This World.. If You Are Strong You Live.. If You Are Weak You Die.. That's The Truth!!    *MerQu|s3*^^ aka *yeKai*^^
