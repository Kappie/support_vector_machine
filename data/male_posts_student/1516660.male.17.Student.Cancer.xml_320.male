I think my boils are caused by plugged sweat glands. Yeah. Ayiah. Dad fetched us at 8.  Hmm. We went to eat kueh chap as breakfast. After eating breakfast, we went to the doctor's. Hmm. Said the same old things, nhothing new. Must not eat seafood, must not eat peanuts, must not eat deep-fried foods. Sigh!! Hmmm. After getting the medicine, Father drove us to the nearest POSBank. Yeah. I have to withdraw moolah from mah account to eat Seoul Garden later. I also took money out to return KS and TZ. Yeah lor. After that, Father drove us home. Hmm. I ended up taking the 913 bus there.  Hmm.I met CQ and KS there. We were early, so we went to walk around. We really walked around aimlessly, killing time. At 10.50+, WQ met us and we went tout to wait for the others. Gloria came, followed by SL, Joyce and PY. Hmmm. We waited for the Seoul Garden to open. Hmm.   Soon, it opened. Each of us have to pay 13 bucks. Hmmm. Yes. Oh well. What can I say about Seoul Garden? We ate our fill? HM joined us later. Anyway, I ate mostly seafood. Which is clams (harms). Heh Heh. Disease/cancer my foot! I am eating harms and nobody's ain't stopping moi. Anyway, I stopped eating after I find them too salty. Yeah. It happens. Oh well. I also ate some meat. I find the chicken Bou-something very spicy. Hot hot!!   Hmm. After Seoul Garden, we decided to go play pool. O.O I got lotsa moolah, so can play all we want. HaHa. I even treated CQ, because he don't have money left. Even the ducks meowed at pool for 2 hours! Yes! We played from 2.30 to 4something. Meow moo meow!!  After that, the ducks are going home. I wanted to walk to Marsiling, actually, take 911 bus to meet Mother. AHHHHHH!!! MY PLANS ARE SPOILT!! Gloria tagged along..... ergh!!!!! We (me, CQ, WQ, Gloria, Joyce and PY) went to a park and started chatting. Hmm. We mostly reminised about olde times. After that, we walked home. Hmm. I sent WQ off home. Heh. There are several reaons for me doing so, but I ain't gonna explain here. Hmmm. On the way back home, me and Wendy chatted. Heh. A funny incident happened, but I can't and wouldn't elaborate. So embarassing!! Even ducks meow!  Hmm. I came home, bathed and ate dinner (noodles). Hmm. Tada! I am here. Tomorrow's the results of my posting. Ergh. I am so worried. Meow mooo mooo moooo!!! I want to get into Pioneer Junior College! MEOW MOO!!  Okay. I gotta go. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
