Now...I'm in pit..which means everybody says i can't complain cause I'm not out marching...or not marching...depending on if they have to stand at attention for 10 minutes or not.  Anyway...The point being...We are all in this for the long run...and I don't like to see my fellow band mates to suffer... SO  I decided to be nice yesterday and help out the trumpets by getting them towels and exchanging them. Mr. Stout didn't like this idea because i guess he wants everybody to suffer...(i had nothing to do on the sidelines anyway....) so he tells me "Go away Mitch...You're starting to get on my nerves."  Haha..I was sooo close to saying..."I'M getting on YOUR nerves? I QUIT" and walking off the field...But i felt bad for the other band members so I was pushing through for them...Plus I exchanged towels whether he likes it or not. Then I helped serve water....which sacrificed my water break but hey...As long as I can help the band.  In fact...I'm thinking of quitting band and just helping the band boosters. I dunno... Alot of people don't want me to quit...and I don't know why...I mean I don't want to be part of a band that has a director that cares so little about his band. Stout just wants to leave his mark on the Decatur High Band because he doesn't yet have tenure...Doesn't care about the band.  My brother isn't coming to Band Camp today because he is soo burned that his face is puffed up bigger than Mr. Stout's ego. The bass drum reflects the sun right into his face and he can barely move....So mom said he can't go...no matter what Stout says. So yea....  Pull through everybody. Let's pull through this together.  Cause you know if one person cracks and quit...then everybody else is gonna crack and quit...the Tension is THAT high.  I'm so close....
