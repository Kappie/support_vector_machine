I had a bad meeting with the coworkers about the website just like on Friday but the evening was a bit better.  I got a ton of mail on Tuesday. 3 birthday cards, each with money in them, and my movie Outfoxed came today. Actually, they sent me 2 on accident! Woohoo!  Tuesday after work, I went and visited Laura. We went to Walmart to shop for food and stuff. Cindy told me not to buy any food, but I had coupons... so I bought a ton of food. I bought some cake mix and frosting for my birthday on Wednesday. Laura and I made a meatball sub dinner with salad and smoothies. We watched Trading Spouses, but Cindy called and I went and picked her up. We needed to do laundry and I had promised to pick her up around 8.  I went and got quarters from Movies 10 ($5 for me $5 for Cindy) and came back and did laundry. I dropped Cindy off, went to bed after folding up some clothes. Interesting, huh?  Wednesday was my birthday. My apartment was a mess. I had meant to clean it, but every time I planned for it, something else came up. Work was blah. However, I came in and someone had put a HAPPY BIRTHDAY sign over my office door and my non-co-workers threw me a party with pudding cake and a card. It was really nice of them. The folks upstairs didn't really even notice.  After work I went and bought 3 movie tickets from the cashier's office, I made cupcakes and frosted them and Laura came over and we went to the Post Office and finally mailed Cindy's book that she left here. We headed to Tinseltown and met up with Jake and watched Spiderman 2, which was a great movie. Gave me chills several times. After, we cameback to my place. We picked up Cindy and I invited Kerri over to hang out. I went to pick up Linda, but she called and said she didn't want to come. The cat had walked all over all the cupcakes (luckily, I covered them with papertowels). If I didn't like her so much, I'd kill her!  I went back to the forbidden Hess, got some soda and gas, and went home to hang out with everyone. We had some cupcakes, ice cream and I opened my present from Laura. Wow.. she got me this huge dinnerware set.. plates, dishes, cups and bowls. She also got me some glass cups. They're all so fantastic.. Laura eventually left and we went over to the Distillery and got Jake some food. Cindy and Kerri went to McDonalds and got some food. She got me a double cheeseburger.. sometimes something so little makes ya happy.  Kerri and Cindy left and Jake stayed over that night. I had to get up at 5 to take Linda to the airport on Thursday. She went and had a job interview in Washington DC to do the same thing Luke Osborne does. I came back and woke Jake up at 7 so he could go to work. Then I woke up at 8 and went to work, albeit very tired. Jake forgot his cell phone, so it looks like I'm babysitting this weekend for it.  Thursday was also blah.. but fortunately, I'm done with this damn website! No more dribble over it anymore. Went to the gym during lunch (early lunch). After work I went to Verizon Wireless, Cingular Wireless and BJs. I used up a gift card that Mary Joan and Frank gave me for my birthday. I'm also looking into porting my Verizon cell number to Cingular and then porting right back to Verizon. I need to call about that.  Cindy came over after I got back and she wrote one of her papers while I cleaned the apartment. She stayed over (but stayed awake all night) while I slept. Now I'm sitting at work, contemplating all the work I should be doing. I'm waiting on several people to get back to me, plus someone brought in really tasty bagels today.  Tonight Cindy and I are going to Greece to eat Chinese and maybe a movie after. What's bugging me is I seem to have lost $10 from between Tuesday and today. and its driving me insane trying to figure it out.
