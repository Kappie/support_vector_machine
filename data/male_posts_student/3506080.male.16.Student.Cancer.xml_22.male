As I was doing earlier, I read the fifth Harry Potter book. I've just stumbled onto chapter nineteen-ish before sitting down on my bed to use the computer once again. This blog is kinda fun. It's like having a one-sided conversation with my trusty monitor, except everyone else can read it. I have to remember not to give away any hints for D (Dungeons  Dragons). The MP system I have been working is coming along nicely, with a little help from some Mages I have come to know as my clansmen. Spellmaking is fun! Oooh....  shiny .... Wow, only 3 a.m. and I am already showing signs of fatigue. I really have lost my touch. However, I will not give up. My goal is not a lofty one. I will remain awake until I receive my paycheck, at which point I will probably collapse in the lobby. Anyway, I should probably get back to work on my MP system for the next time my group meets, probably 2 weeks from sunday, if I can manage that day...wait, nope, can't do it then either. Darn Father's day... Oh well, at least there are only 20 days until my birthday! Woo hoo!
