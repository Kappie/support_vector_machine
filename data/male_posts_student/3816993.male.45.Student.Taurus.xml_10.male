Granted, sixty, even thirty years ago, there weren’t many options for young women to serve their country through the military forces. But, times have changed. We’ve had substantially more women killed, injured, captured, and even involved with the abuse of prisoners.   In the past, it was normative for the sons of leaders to join the ranks of the military (even facing combat on occasion!) to show support for their fathers’ objectives. So, given the change in status for women in the military, and given the objectives of President George W. Bush and his administration,  and  given the age of Jenna and Barbara Bush, why haven’t they volunteered their efforts to the military?
