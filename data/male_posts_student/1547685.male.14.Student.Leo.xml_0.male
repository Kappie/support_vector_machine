Last i heard he was paralized on his right side and might stay paralized forever. Theres so many questions that have yet to be answered so i pray that God will answer them with what he thinks is right. Also, hes not saved so please help me and pray for him daily that he will be able to pull out of this. My aunt is saved.......i think and shes had a really hard time getting around b/c she cant drive and nothing is walking distance from her house. I also pray that God will help her in everything that is going on. Another tragety is that my grandma is in the hospital b/c of a pendacitis (I think thats what it is) but i PTL that she was able to catch it in time. Even though she has to spend the night in the hospital i thank the Lord that is was not fatal. Also, pray for my mom b/c shes really stressed out right now with my great aunt, great uncle, grandmother, and another aunt thats having a hard time with public transportation. She has to also do this Medical that helps my great aunt get money to pay for my great uncles medical stuff since its going to be like $300 a day for him to stay in a nurseing home. If you can help me pray for this stuff i would really appreciate it.
