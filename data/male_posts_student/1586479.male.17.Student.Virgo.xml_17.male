I don't care what people say; all three of his films are on my list of best movies of all time. They just have such great characters, acting, and they get better every time I watch them. Wow. Unbreakable's cool.  Hmmm....I play way too many video games. Yeah. Me and my faja hhad a big ol fight about that.  Till next time! And remember; always brush your teeth and wash behind your ears.
