Let the record show that Red Sox Rant #1 was a rather positive affair, a pleasant outlook with sunny skies and light winds out of the southeast, high temperatures of 76 degrees. Well, let me tell you: the winds have shifted since my last forecast. The sunny skies have turned into a strange mix of rain, hail, and blood (yes, all at once). The light winds have turned into a wicked pissah nor'easter (that's a really really strong storm for the rest of you). In April, the Sox swept the Yankees in Yankee Stadium (aka "The Death Star"). They were leading the AL East. Oh what a difference a couple of months makes. Time heals all wounds and destroys all hopes for the Good Guys. It seems like just yesterday that everyone was looking ahead to the playoffs. Now, the Boston media is saying the Sox should just shoot for the wildcard. What does that even mean??? Play well, but not too well. Just well enough to come in second to the Yankees. Again.   That, I must say, is the infuriating thing about the sports scene in Boston, it's just so reactionary and quick to judge. They love you one minute and hate you the next. How long ago did all of Boston rejoice at Nomar's return? And already they're calling for a trade. Why? Because he's not perfect yet. Because maybe he didn't come back at 100% and he's working out the kinks, the way most players do in spring training. Except this isn't the Grapefruit League, this is the real deal now, and the smallest foul up gets magnified and analyzed and people start calling for your head. They turn on you. I wouldn't blame Nomar if he wanted to get out of Boston ASAP, just to be able to get out from under the microscope. That sort of thing can really get to you. That's why David Wells left the Yankees, a perennial World Series contender, for the San Diego Padres, who are.....the San Diego Padres. He's 3-5 with a 3.25 ERA, and I'm sure he couldn't be happier.   I'd like to not over-react to a sweep at the hands of the Yankees at this point in the season, but it's pretty hard. I keep thinking the Sox have a huge run in them, that they'll go on a big tear and rip it up. I know they can do it, they've done it before. When their offense is clicking, they're unstoppable. Their pitching has all the ingredients. The next month will be crucial.
