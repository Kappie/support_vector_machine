Instead of having to learn and use HTML ( H ypertext  M ark  U p  L anguage), you can now use a word processor like format to add to your blog! This makes it a lot easier,  but,  my urlLink Firefox  browser causes the format to change and it freezes up and closes everytime I post.    Thisisn't much of a problem when I use urlLink Internet Explorer , so I'll start using it to post. Don't worry, it doesn't change anything, and maybe they'll get it to working sooner or later. Anyway, I have to go outside for a sec, then I'll make a 3rd and maybe final post before updating my current book.
