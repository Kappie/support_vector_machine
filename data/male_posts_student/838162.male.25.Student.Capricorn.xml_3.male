Also on the Gamer’s Edge, new demos of three games that I had my eye on were released and I felt it my duty (and pleasure) to spend a few nights to test them out. Sorry to have neglected the blog in the meantime.   Guard duty was pretty ok. The guards under me were experienced and so they knew their roles and what was expected of them. The guard commander was experienced as well. I have worked with him twice before, so everything was able to run quite smoothly. As a result, I had time to walk around the camp alone and in a leisurely manner. That’s not to say that I have never walked around the camp before, I have done normal guard duties once if I may remind you. Anyway, the camp I was doing duty for as basically one big carpark and thus there as a good view of the sky without any obstructions.    One of my favorite past times when I’m jacked out of the Net, is to watch the sunset and the moonrise. It doesn’t really matter if I can’t actually see the sun (hard to do so here with our constant city skyline), it’s the clouds that really matter. The way the sky slowly burns then darkens as the clouds past by in their range of patterns and how the stars slowly appear out of the darkness. I simply love it.  To me it is both a joy and a sight to humble me by. Everytime I am able to witness the sunset, it reminds me of how much bigger the world, the universe is compared to us. Mankind always talks of our great our science is, of how much we have accomplished, of how much destructive force we have at our fingertips, of how simply powerful we are. But to make the sun set, the sky burn, the clouds move, the moon to shine, the earth to move and our galaxy to orbit, that is real power. A power that is so beyond us, a power to create such wonders, that have made a creation so  perfect  that to me, is proof that is beyond any doubt that there is a Creator out there.  He speaks to me during those times that I just sit there watching the sky. I like to believe that he especially enjoys speaking to me in these times although He is able to do so at anytime. Perhaps it only at these times that I am really actually listening. Perhaps its only at these times that I can actually hear His answers.  He reminds me of who I really am. Not some lost soul that wanders the empty and haunted corridors of Cyberspace, but a living, breathing, thinking, feeling being. It is in times like these that I actually stop referring to myself as the three separate entities of Net-Icon, Emotion Core and Meat. In those times I am a single created person. In those times I am truly alive.  To all those who find themselves constantly seeking Him. Stop. Raise your eyes upwards. The sky you see, the breeze you feel, the sounds of life you hear, even the very water you drink. He is there. He is everywhere. He is simply waiting, for you to stop and listen. To allow Him to answer the questions you have asked.
