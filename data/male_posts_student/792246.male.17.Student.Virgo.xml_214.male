So that it doesn't die, I've decided to  steal  repost the dialogue.   Bun-Bun : Speaking of people you don't like respecting you, I had a length conversation with Ms. Lo this morning.   Portia : That conversation was so funny...you have no idea.   Claudia : What happened?   Kelly : well, i had to ask her about the olympic-sized, underground, fountain-housing, lit swimming pool she wants mounted on a turntable for metamorphosis. this was lengthy because when the conversation started, it was about girl scout cookies, because she was trying to sell me some. then, in her incredibly subtle manner, she intimated that she might like some help with a little project she had planned, which had something to do with a certain fall play. details were not forthcoming, as she did not want to put me off, so i stayed in the theatre from 3 until 8 discussing the feasibility of this project. i expect it will take me about two hours, but i just wanted to be sure. we threw ideas around and by the end, we had this beautiful display worked out where we put jessie ferguson and chris richardson in bathing suits and had them diving into a glass-sided pool from 100-ft. platforms (we'll have to suspend the proscenium a little ways up, we're thinking on four cranes parked in the quad) and then they do a synchronized routine--it's charming--in a tribute to those wonderful water ballet numbers from the golden age of hollywood. portia was there, and she was tickled pink by our lovely idea.   Bun-Bun : Essentially what Kelly said.
