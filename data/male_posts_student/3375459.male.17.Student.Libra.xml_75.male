HEhe… I almost made a wrong turn into the Mistress Block, no I dun have a mistress there… So stop thinking about it, it was merely a wrong turn. Since it was still early, I site at the Pulau Siagoon Brigde and did a tally on the vehicular and pedestrian movement around the site. Yeah, then my group mate showed up, and we went photo shooting. Before long it was night, the warehouse is super eerie especially after a light drizzle and the trees were “crying” constantly.  We met up with some of our classmates and made our way down to the nearest flats to take a distance view of our site. Then “BOOM BOOM BOOM~” goes the sky. It was the fireworks and we behind the flats climbing a super steep staircase. On hearing the banging  boomings from the fireworks, the girls dashed up the stairs like they were walking down them. They took a lift to the 12th floor of the closet flat without waiting for us guys, but Ha! They saw nothing but smoke. Server them right for not waiting for us to take the lift.  That flat wasn’t ideal to take photos of out site, thus we head for the nest block. ….. T.B.C.
