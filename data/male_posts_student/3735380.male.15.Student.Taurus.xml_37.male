Well, the truth is that Im actually going to use that term because my parents badgered me out of something I really wanted to do.  Okay, I wanted to see my girlfriend's play. My parents wanted me to invite a friend. First of all, they will be more bothered than interested.  My parents kept bugging me over and over and over. I finally gave in. I called all my friends up and asked them to see the play with me.  The only problem was that they were all on vacation. Now that means that I get to go alone. The futile argument was won by me, but it didnt last long.  My parents cancelled the reservations. Sore losers! They said wait until next week when they're all home.  Bah. Badgers.
