Delp, a researcher at Purdue University  is working with Philips to make a  monster 140" monitor  using 4 projectors on a single screen.  Article claims it would be good for National Security... I dunno, I see this being the only way to satisfy 'big screen envy.'"   Sounds fun--I wonder if it's in my price range. Oh, and I hope it's portable, too...think they'll start attaching these babies to laptops? That'd be nice, as I'm getting a laptop before I head off to college in a couple of years...though I wonder what kind of resolutions that kind of a monitor lets you choose from....800 x 600 just might not work anymore.
