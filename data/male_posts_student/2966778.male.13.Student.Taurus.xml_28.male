Not one but SIX viruses.  Trojans and the like to be exact.  Anyway, I won't be using the internet on that computer for a while.  But I will be using another laptop in the house (the one I'm using now.)  Anyway here's a list of artists I find interesting at the time.  In other words, I want their album(s).: Steve Burns (yes, the guy who used to be on  Blue's Clues ) Yellowcard Coheed and Cambria Anyway, later.
