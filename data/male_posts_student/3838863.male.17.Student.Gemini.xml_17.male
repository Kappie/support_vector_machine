After tat, i went for AVac duties. Everything went quite well during the rehearsal until the duet part. Zhi Xun told us not to set up the keyboard first. We thought that we will not need the keyboard during the rehearsal. Then Mdm Ho snapped at us. >=( Said some mean things to us. We were at the lost. CAnt find the extension wire.  Had to run to RC room to get more extension. My SM could not take it and I saw him crying outside the hall. In my haste to get the wires and keyboard up, i left him there. But everything went well after that. The real thingy was great.  My SM had a great time running around and having fun again. =D  Reflecting upon the situation, i guess. Sometimes, i do need to just break down and cry too. Perhaps its my rebellous nature.  The harder you push me, the stronger front i'll put up. lolx~ i'm making myself sound so tough. hHhmm. admire Zhi XUn. =D  Oh ya. My mum is not dead against Christians anymore.  XiaoYi juz called me. Thankew God. So so much. MUacKX~  Adios babes and hunks.
