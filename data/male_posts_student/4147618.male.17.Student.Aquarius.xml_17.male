Discussions/Thoughts of the day:  1) The reason I choose the title as I, Ria (no it's not to copy the movie I, Robot), is to wonder what personality would Ria have? Would she go more on the Ahuja family....Topiwala family or the Bulsara family? As the generations keep growing, the arriving child gets a much bigger gene pool to swim in.  For eg., Ria will have the option to aquire from ALL the gene pools that I have been a part of + ALL the gene pools that Sami has been a part of.  However scary that may sound, it wont be that hard to figure out who she is imitating when she exhibits a certain behaviour. Keeping that in mind... I would like for each one of you to list the following:  	a) Physical Characteristics 	b) Personality (Good) 	c) Personality (Bad)  Maybe...just Maybe..we'll get an idea of what she CAN have.  We'll start with me, and It would be cool if you guys/gals can comment with yours.   **Dharmesh Topiwala (Dad-to-be)**  -Physical Characteristics-: Tall (5'10), Broad, Long Nose ( :---) ), Hairy, huge calves (naturally), long eye lashes, long and fast growing finger nails, uneven body (right side is higher and shorter then the left side), no upper lip, square face structure, vascular (lots of veins, even when I was big), huge hands, big feet.  -Personality (Good)-: Confident, Patient, Intelligent (I think), Loving, Caring.  -Personality (Bad)-: None .. hah J/k.  Moody, Bad temper, Jealous, Sometimes..TOO carefree.  I am sure there are more, as Sami and others will point out..and I will happily update :-) .   2) Ria will also do something that no doctor, or scientist can do. It will make blood relatives of two separate families.  For eg., Priyesh and Kunal will be blood related to Angad and Arjun through Ria. Such a little life..possesses so much power.  More later...
