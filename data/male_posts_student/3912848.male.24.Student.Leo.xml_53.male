Today's rant...part one:  people should have to take some sort of test to prove they are not idiots before they can have bank accounts...part two:  the idea that kerry is electable is ludacris (ridicu LOUS) *that was for kehr*  but morons keep talking about it like it's a viable option.  booo!!!  *that was for o'toole*  if 37% of americans vote for the idiot michael moore should be shot  *that was for jim*  sorry to the texans, i really don't have any special thoughts for y'all.  dallas
