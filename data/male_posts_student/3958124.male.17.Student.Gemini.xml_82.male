So Kali asked me if I wanted to come over and watch a movie yesterday. Of course I agreed to come - I've watched a bunch of good movies at her house and expected the same from this night. When I got there around 9:00, Mike looked over at me on the couch and said, "We got Gigli." "Oh," I replied. Now realize that Gigli did get bad reviews. Mike tried to rationalize the rental by saying the reviews were not as bad as the Cat in the Hat, which he said they would rent for the next time.  So. Gigli. It was given the tagline " Murder. Blackmail. Temptation. Redemption. It's been a busy week." IMDB rates it a 2.1 out of 10. I'd say that's pretty generous. Ben Affleck gets an assignment from his "gangster" boss to kidnap a retarded boy. The boy is the brother of a federal prosecutor involved in a case against Affleck's boss' boss, a guy from New York. Affleck succesfully kidnaps the boy, but somehow, his boss thinks he's a "Fuckup", so, to save the day, send Jennifer Lopez to help him. As one might expect, Affleck wants J Lo in the sack. In an incredible plot twist, Jenny-from-the-block turns out to be Jenny-who-hates-the-cock; she's a lesbian.  For much of the movie, Jennifer uses big words that require long pauses inbetween, giving viewers the impression that the retarded kid is a better speaker. Not only does Jennifer pause quite often. An average of 3 awkward silences per minute confirms millions of people's suspicions: there were no editors, directors or even writers for this movie. The pauses are Benniffer's chance to regroup and come up with something  new  and stupid to say. I must say they are quite good at that.  All in all, I'd probably agree with IMDB on the rating: 2.1/10. However I would like to ask mike for something if he ever reads this. TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK. Thanks for a good time last night.  Less Ben and Jen, sooner. PLEASE.
