I also got McDonald's sausage mcmuffin, here's how it went down: Cashier in drivethru: Welcome to McDonalds, please wait.  Okay, sorry for the wait, can I take your order. Me: I'd like a sausage mcmuffin with two packets of ketchup. Guy: Sir, we don't serve big macs for breakfast. Me: I know, I'd like a sausage mcmuffun with two ketchups. Guy: Is that all?  That will be $1.08, please pull up. Guy: You said you wanted jelly right?  Who eats jelly on their sausage?  (By the way, why did my spell checker just suggest 'sweatshops' instead of 'ketchups'?)  Anyway, my friend Kim just had her baby.  I'm so happy for her, I can't wait to see pictures.  I got to work and immediately worked on the status report for Garry for the DARS stuff.  I'm not sure why I needed to do it in such a formal way, but I did and it looked good.  We had our usual Friday morning meeting and I went downstairs and finished some coding.  I had my usual Friday meeting with LAS.  Vicki wasn't around so I had to meet with her assistants.  Whatever, I still get paid a load to work for them too.  Garry left at noon.  I went to the gym late.  I worked for a bit and hung out with the coworkers for a bit.  It's relaxing without Supervisors.  I always love these times.  They said we can all go home at 3:30 today.  Bah, I had already planned on it!  I'm off to the apartment with Cindy and maybe Laura to wait for the cable guy.
