They revolved to a music which kept them spinning, and thereafter, life continuing.  Pythagoras claimed to hear this music.  After Pythagoras, several philosophers expanded on his theory, including Plato.  However, Aristotle took the theory and put a twist on it, saying that the spheres made up a symphony, producing the heavenly music by their spinning.  Then there was Persius, who said that this music can no longer be heard by human ears because evil has corrupted the hearts of the human race over time.  So, from Pythagoras began an idea that music is intricately related with the heavenly cosmos.
