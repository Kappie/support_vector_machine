Eventually, he took this little kid's shoe and ran away with it. I tried to catch him, but alas, it was to late for yon shoe. Funny thing is I think it was this little Indian kid's shoe. They live across the street from me and are terrified of my dog. I'm still working on that audio post, I'll do it later. I guess that's it for now. I must have way to much time on my hands to put in this many posts in on one day. Oh well.
