Fortunately, I have a neat way of dealing with it: I take the light rail over to the nearby San Jose State University campus, plug hermod into one of the ethernet jacks at the library  work there. 
It's an interesting change from working in my cube, since there are a ton of students milling around at the library. 
  
Of course, I still need to check my Sun email, so I don't head over to the campus until after lunch. Instead, I work in a flexible workspace at Sun's Santa Clara HQ, which is right around the corner from my apt. This way I can eat at the awesome cafeteria there and catch a game of pickup volleyball just before lunch.
