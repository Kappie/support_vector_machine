This ticks me off!  2-00P So I called Mom and she found someone (John Lucio) to milk with me, but that's still not so good! He will only maybe be able to keep me from falling behind. It is still going to be a lot of work. -------- I hate this farm and I wish I lived in town. X(  4-30P I set up AudioBlogger (For Voice Blogs) and Hello (For picture Blogs); I found that the audio number is from southern California :'( -- man this day is full of dissapointments! I guess I will use my cell phone to call it whenever I need to ;)  5-01P I got the cows in the barn to be milked and I fed them. It'll be another hour before John gets here; then I will have to milk. :'(   6-00P John Got here! He is so nice:) We milked cows and he helps a lot! I hated milking though. Dad better pay me a whole bunchu money! He said he would pay me some.  11-00P We've been done milking for a while now. I think we finished around 9-30P But I am still sore! :( OMG this day is so full of crap! Maybe if it starts out bad it can only get better. *:) So keep reading ;)  That's it. I am going to poast this and go to bed now. --- Well probably not right away but soon. I have to get cleaned up; I will probably chat and watch tv for a while then and finaly go to bed at about 1A  Tschüß
