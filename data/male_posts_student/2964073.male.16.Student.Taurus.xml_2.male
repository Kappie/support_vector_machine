Is it more effective to have your keyword  mentioned in the top third, middle third or bottom third  of a page?   Here is the methodology I used to answer this question. I  gathered the results of the queries naturally performed  last month by myself and three associates using Yahoo and  Google. I then fetched the pages and divided the body  section into three equal parts for each page. I tallied  the results for the first 8 rankings on both Yahoo and  Google (keeping the results separate) and then converted  them into a percentage of the total results for each  search engine.  Here are the graphs showing Google and Yahoo results:  http://www.SearchEngineGeek.com/graphs/dfg02.gif http://www.SearchEngineGeek.com/graphs/dfy02.gif  (Note to webmasters/ezine editors: You are welcome to hot  link to these graphs or even copy them to your own site.   You are also welcome to remove this note.)  The X-axis shows the ranking (from #1 through #8) of the  search engine results in the study. The Y-axis shows the  percentage of domains that contained the keyword in the  top (red line), middle (blue line) and bottom (purple  line) thirds of the body section of the page.  It is interesting to note that pages containing the  keyword in the top and bottom third of the body section  ranked much better on Google. The top section had a  normalized correlation of +42 on a scale of -100 to +100.  The bottom third also showed a remarkable positive  correlation of +46 on the same scale. Having the keyword  in the middle third had no significant effect (no  correlation whatsoever... neither positive nor negative).  The Yahoo results were even more interesting. I generally  ignore any correlations between -35 and +35 as being  generally insignificant. On Yahoo, none of the three  sections showed any remarkable correlations. The scores  were a +17 for the top, -3 for the middle and -17 for the  bottom third of the body section. Does this mean that  Yahoo doesn't even look for the keyword in the body  section?  Advice: Mention your keywords near the top and/or bottom  of a page for Google ranking.
