Imagine 14th century France and a bunch of smelly English men outside your castle.  All of a sudden a dead horse is launched into your courtyard.  off in the distance you see...YES! a trebuchet.  Dreaded tool of seige.  And soon, (im thinking mid summer) you shall see one in the left hand corner of my pasture flinging tennis balls filled w/ napalm and matchhead bombs at the remains of an old shed.  heheh.  I can't wait.
