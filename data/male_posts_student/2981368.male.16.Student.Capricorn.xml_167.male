Went to Cribbs again for yet more clothes shopping. Was SOOO DAMN CLOSE to getting a test drive in a limited edition Rover. Tried to win it by picking up loads and loads of the competition entry cards. But only managed to win 3 "Visa  Team GB drawstring bags!". Oh joy.      I did, however, manage to get a couple ofDead Ringers CDs, and found out that the full version of 3 kingdoms(chinese war novel) is bigger than LotR. And costs Â£25.98. Oh well.       Oneeversoslightly interesting thing I learned at Tescos on the way back was that the person from North Carolina going into Y12 in the 6th form with us lot is actually a year older. But had to start the AS/A level course again because the US version has a completely different sylabus. Ha. A whole wasted year.
