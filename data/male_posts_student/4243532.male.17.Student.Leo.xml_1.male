All the good and entertaining superstars are gone.  The Rock, Mankind, Stone Cold etc...  And the superstars that are still there like Triple H and the Undertaker are boring now.  Characters keep changing and the twists are expected.  Plus, wrestling is not as abrasive or in-your-face as it was in the past.  The tag teams suck, and it is just boring.  Plus, they have a split:  Smackdown and Raw.  This is bullshit, because each show has about 25 wrestlers and how can they fit them all on one show?  It's a crappy system.  I still watch it from time to time, but it is not interesting anymore.  Vince Macmahon is a bitch for playing into "the parents."  The WWE is actually trying to get parents involved and having teens vote.  STOP THIS POLITCALLY CORRECT BULLSHIT.  It's wrestling not some show on the Disney Channel.
