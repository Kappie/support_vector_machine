The purpose of a district meet is that people in a certain district have a HUGE co-ed meet. In the mens it is the top three compeditors in every event goes on to the state track meet at Drake Stadium. With girls its a little different. They send the top two, then the third place people are all thrown into a group and they find the fastest one in the whole state of the third place finishers. That person also goes to state.  We had many people going to state:  Tyler Vermeer  -  Long Jump, High Jump, Medley Relay (400 m leg)   Tyler Dodd  -  High Jump, 110 m High Hurdles   Nick Harklau  -  110 m High Hurdles, Medley Relay (200 m leg)   Thomas George  -  Medley Relay (800 m leg)   Chris Lee  -  Discus   Alex  -  Medley Relay (200 m leg)   Congrats to everyone that is going to state boys and girls, you have worked hard.  P.S. My sister is going to state. Congrats Anne
