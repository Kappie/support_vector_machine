Anyway, on their website I discovered that they'll be playing in Chico on 7/16. Dude, I hella wanna go to that show. I don't care if I don't even own the friggin' album (that will change when I make my next trip to Tower); it doesn't mean I don't wanna see them! I really hope to see them! I'll be sure to tell you if I do.  You gonna go to any good shows, tell me.
