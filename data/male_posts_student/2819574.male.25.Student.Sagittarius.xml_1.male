The answer of a Chicago Economics Phd student to the question "What makes a successful economist ?".  Now the only comment I have (besides the realization i am citing too much out of Colander), doesn't the guy have his priorities wrong ? I mean, "RECITING" the Kama Sutra, come on, find a wife and then... you know what ;-)
