I fell asleep to SNL, rerun... Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey were the hosts...    So last night was cool as my mom had to babysit the Ross's, and my brothers and i got to spend the night over there. That was the first time in 5 or 6 years i have ever slept over there.     So i woke up and helped clean up the house, we wrecked it. Then i went and got some waffles, and as usual, Katie went and hung out with her kindergarden friends and went to her 12 year old boyfriends birthday party. Shes 14... I have my feelings on that whole situation, but i ahve a feeling that most people know about it...    So i just hung out and earned some more money doing chores. Then, bang, corruption in the Seifter houshold.    "MOM, CHRIS SCRATCHED UP BOTH CARS" Andrew screamed.    My little brother Chris, while cleaning hte cars as he normally does, made a big mistake. He took a MOP to the car and mopped the outside of the car... leaving scratches up to as long as my arm. Ohhhh my parents were not too happy. Somehow he got off the hook from his month long punishments, i dont know how, and my house had broken into civil war.    Mom Vs. Andrew - Mad at him because he rats on his siblings too much  Parents Vs. Chris - Scratched up their car  Mom Vs. Dad - Dad thinks mom defends children too much, doesnt discipline us enough.  Me Vs. Family - Im trying to listen to Switchfoot and all I hear is your screaming.    So now im in charge of the cars! Thats ten extra bucks a week.  Cool with me... thats a 70 + dollar weekend.    So that was interesting. My face is getting better... my scrapes. I went driving to wal-mart today. It rained and i was nervous. But im a good driver so yeah... I also read like 35 pages of guns germs and steel today. I might read more.     So im watching the ESPYS right now, and that was my day.... Goodnight...     Story of the Year  Till the Day I Die    I will love you till the day that I die     I will love you till the day that I die       You walked into the room     The sun hit my eyes     The force you struck me down caught me by surprise     You sprung the mojo and it worked like a charm     I felt invincible with you in my arms       I must confess it can feel good to feel pain     Like breaking waves or getting caught in the rain     Playing those games cause we had nothing to do     I was oblivious I was losing to you       I will love you till the day that I die     I will love you till the day that I die     I will love you till the day that I die     I will love you till the day that I die       Holy Jesus     Holy rock'n'roll     The more I gave to you the more you grew bored     And making love became the waging of war     No peace     No tenderness     No fun anymore       I will love you till the day that I die     I will love you till the day that I die     I will love you till the day that I die     I will love you till the day that I die       I dreamt that I called out your name     You turned your face to me and started to say     Something so beautiful it hurt deep inside     So I will love you till the day that I die       Farewell     Farewell     I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die)     Farewell     Farewell     I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die)     Farewell     Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die)     I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die)     Farewell     Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die)     I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die)     Farewell     Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die)     I'm sure gonna leave you (I will love you till the day that I die)     Farewell     Farewell (I will love you till the day that I die)     I'm sure gonna leave you      I just started listening to this band today... might start pick up the CD sometime this week... Its a really cool song, and the guitar solo in the beginning is awesome.
