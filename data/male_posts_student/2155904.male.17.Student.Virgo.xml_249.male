The latter part of the word comes from the fact that the day is over and it will be a really long time til the next one like it. So you most likely want to know what Tyke did, or if you already know what he did, how Tyke went about writing it. The morning and mid-day was spent looking at laptops with his mom and on his own. He hasn't made a completely final decision yet but he is pretty much set on what he's getting. The Dell Inspiron 8600 with quite a few upgrades. It is going to be pretty sick when it finally gets here/is ordered. But that really took up most of the day. It was fun but Tyke really just wants to order the damn thing so he can get it and start using it. It's going to be great! After that Tyke talked with Kinker and Tyronious online and then his dad called so they talked for a little. Tyke then realized he was leaving in less than two hours for the Mariners game so he had to finish up a CD he was working on as well as get some food. So he ate some great Top Ramen and then finished up the CD. After that he got dressed (he wasn't naked before though) and left for Purdy's. He got there and watched a little tv with her family as she ate some jello. They talked about the Mariners and then got on the subject of the tent city where a lot of homeless people are housed temporarily. Quickly departing from that subject Tyke and Purdy took off for the game. It was still really nice out today so the drive over the water was really pretty. Then again, so was the passenger. Tyke found his usual area for parking but this time did an adjacent lot to the norm and ended up not liking this area all that much after all was said and done. But the parking lot guy did give them cracker jacks and said that Purdy was cuter than Tyke. It turned out that Ekul, Haras, and Kramm were all at the game as well but they were in different seats. Ekul came down from the terrace club to say hi to Tyke and Purdy but Haras was never able to find where they were sitting even after they called her and tried to tell her. But Tyke and Purdy saw her. The game was a pretty good one. The M's looked like themselves for most of the time but late in the game they actually played well! And got some help as well. It went into extra innings but not the 18 that Tyke said it would. Purdy would have "slit her wrists" if that happened. It was really superbly awesome to hang out with Purdy throughout the game. There were tons of babies on the screen and going up and down the aisles which made Purdy happy and Tyke enjoyed seeing that. After the game Tyke drove them to Purdy's house where she got her car and then they drove up to Kramm's to join everyone from the game as well as Tig. They just watched Dude Where's My Car? for a little bit and really didn't do all that much. But Tyke got to see Haras for the first time all summer which was great. Hopefully they can hang out soon. Tyke left and came home to sulk on the computer and blog. Another great night but it all ends so unfulfillingly. Empty days and empty nights drone on continuously. There are bright spots and enticing mirages down every road but they all end up fake or busted. It doesn't seem to matter which road Tyke traverses as they all lead to the same path, back to the road he was just on. Tyke is driving down this road with his headlights on searching for some signpost that points him in the right direction or maybe something that tells him how far off he is. Maybe he just needs to stop and ask for directions. Because 7 hours in 7 days doesn't equate to eternal happiness.
