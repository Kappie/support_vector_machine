I'll kick your ass. lol  I already know that I'll have some bones to pick with a few people in my class. They're both staunch republicans, and one can't even come up with 3 good reasons (that aren't based on faulty CIA intelligence...) why George W. Bush should be elected this November. He couldn't come up with 3...like there even are 3.  As for today:  I was late for MITY and missed the opening convocation because my car broke down (you know, the red Ford Fuckus ZX5). There were some problems with the fuel exhaust recirculation system, so when you tried to start the car it would turn over and quit. So, my dad took forever (as usual) in getting the other car driven a mile away from our house (literally). After the switch, avoiding some traffic and some detours, I got to Macalester at 9:00.  As it turned out, on the contrary to my guess, Debate is in Olin Rice Science hall, at the far south end of the campus, whereas I thought it would be held in Carnegie Hall. Too bad-Carnegie is closer to everything on Campus...  You probably have no clue of what I'm talking about, so just pay a visit to the Macalester Liberal Arts College campus on Grand Ave. in St. Paul sometime. It's a nice place.  After MITY: 1. Played some ultimate frisbee, got dirty. 2. Drove to Blimpie Subs in St. Paul, and got shitty service. The guy didn't know how the fuck to make a turkey, ham, and salami on Sesame Seed without cheese. 3. Drove to Saxon Ford to pick up the red Fuckus, decided not to go to Bike practice tonight. Instead I mowed a lawn that was 12 inches tall. I swear on it.  Now: pack a lunch, sleep. In that order. -_-
