Me: I'm sorry? Cop: Are you aquainted with Portia Carryer? Me: Yes. Cop: She and two straight males were arrested on a murder charge. I need someone to ID them within 8 days or else they walk. Me: I see..does it have to be now? I was about to go get food. (I had a date with Brittany Heideman) Cop: I understand. I'm tired, you're hungry. We'll do this another time. Me: Can I have your number? Cop: *laughs, then is silent for a while, with background chatter* Cop: *to someone in background* I thought it was a cops prerrogotive to work alone. *people laugh in background*  I don't really remember what happened after that, but everyone stay away from Portia. She's a criminal.  *NOTE: Throughout the day yesterday I kept remembering little amusing things that I forgot to put in here. Namely, the specification that it was two  straight  men and the wonderful line about being tired and hungry. Plus, I failed to specify that the cop was female.
