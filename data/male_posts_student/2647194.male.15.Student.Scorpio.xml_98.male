It's sad to think that I might not play ultimate again this year *tear*. That's if Amelia visits Macalester on Friday, but then I get to play Scrabble! Eh...I'm thorougly obsessed.  Up in the booth again...and whoa-Megan's back! lol, my "associate" from Journalism up in the control booth last session is visiting for a few days. That means that yet again, I won't be the one that Mr. Rec blames for bad sound, and I won't be the one, yet again, yelling out the booth window to Mr. Rec during the show. lol.  I'm beginning to think that I like Journalism more than I do Debate. Lincoln-Douglas debate sucks, and debate requires a hell of a lot more work. Plus with Journalism, the whole campus reads (or should read) what you wrote. So its your work getting published, and you can read it in the paper. Plus, I got to interview some of the higher-ups in Macalester and I nearly beat out the Star Trib. and P. Press to a story (see previous posts pertaining to the Ruminator Book Store). I'm better at writing news stories under pressure than writing damned debate speeches in 3 minutes all while sifting through information to find arguments and rebuttals to arguments. Pretty tiring I'd say.  After being at MITY for 3 years, it really pays off. You get to know the "regulars", meet cool people, play ultimate frisbee (yay!), and you have the opportunity to become a well-known part of the MITY community. Helping out with the talent show, being active around campus, famous Rec Hour athlete, etc. lol  Okay, so I'm really tired, and apparently I have the ability to yawn and make other people yawn also (lol Emily). I best be off. *yawns*
