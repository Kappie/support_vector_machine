By looking at sites such as  urlLink SimpleBits  and  urlLink A List Apart , I can see that some major changes can be made that might fix some of the problems that have boggled me for a while. I don't know why I really care so much about it because I am not a professional web designer, but it just bothers me a bit. So hopefully, sometime in the near future, I can make some changes for the better. I say "in the future" because I just tried to make a slight change in the CSS and the result looked as if it would take a lot more time than I have to spare.
