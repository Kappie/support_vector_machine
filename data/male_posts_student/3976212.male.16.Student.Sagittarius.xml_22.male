A lot has happened in my life since this "divorce" stuff started happening with my mother and father. To put it simply (and legally) I went to go live with my mother after the divorce. She had some personal "issues" and...hell she went crazy k? So anyways I moved back with my dad and then he sold the house and I went to go live with my aunts, grandmother, uncle's homes until the beggining on the month. My dad is still living off the money from selling the house (he's renting) and "planes" to get a job. Now I am living here in Qualicum Beach, British Columbia because my dad can't afford to rent there. Things where pretty good when I was temporarily living with my mother, and even better when I was living with my aunt. Now it kinda sucks. I don't know anyone here accept Dave (which I knew before I moved to Surrey for two years-thats when all the "bad" things happened). I have been meaning to make a blog again but i've been worried of my dad disconnecting my Internet because although he has a bitter relationship with my mother-he still listens to every word she says. She claims she will sue my dad if she finds out I am on the Internet. Personally I think it's bullshit, you? Well why? Because I wrote a few bad things about her before. The only thing is...its all true. If you where lucky enough to read it-use the information wisely...if not? you missed out on a hell of a story. It's currently the summer, I spend most of my days eating (low carb food), sleeping (irregularily), talking online (nexopia/msn), listening to music and getting into trouble mmhmm.
