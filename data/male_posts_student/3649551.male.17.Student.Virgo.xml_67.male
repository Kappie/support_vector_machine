As a matter of fact, if you haven't read the books or seen the movies, don't burden other people with your presence. You're useless to society. Anyway, I watched  Fellowship  last night - extended edition, of course. I hadn't seen it in a while and I was struck anew by the character of Boromir. He is such a great representation of the double-edged sword of patriotism. On the one hand, he has a beautiful love for his country and his people. He has dedicated his life to protecting those things and he genuinely considers his people above himself. But that's exactly the problem. It's the reason why so many atrocities have been committed by people in the name of their country. Oscar Wilde described patriotism as 'the virtue of the vicious.' Bertrand Russel said it is, 'the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.' You can't let yourself be blinded by a false ideal that think is your country. Then you're just using it as an excuse to compromise your own morals. Boromir had a genuine desire to protect his people, which I think is very admirable. But the means by which he wanted to accomplish that was where he stumbled. He wanted the Ring for himself so that he could  destroy  those who wanted to destroy Gondor.  Destruction  would have been the embodiment of his patriotism. That's the problem with loving your country: it leads to hating other ones. George Bernard Shaw sums it up well: "Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it." (And yes, I did stumble upon a list of quotes about patriotism ... I was trying to find a particular Oscar Wilde one, which I did  not  find.) Not surprisingly, my examination of an unsatisfactory subject has led me back to pride. It convinces me further that arrogance is the root of all sin. It is really the  original  sin ... it's what caused sin. Thinking you know better than God. It's what turned Satan, one of God's most beautiful creations, into the Father of Lies - a rebel and an abomination. Pride is certainly something I struggle with. I'm the most arrogant person I know. Well, I suspect it of others; I just can't prove it. Like the people that refuse to admit that they're prideful - now  that  is arrogant.
