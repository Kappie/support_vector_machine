We had to pick a guitarist (I picked Dimebag Darrel from Pantera.) and we have to right a two-page report about him. Plus we have to bring all this other crap. I thought we were supposed to learn GUITAR in GUITAR class! If I could, I would leave her class because I know the basics and I get private lessons at George's which is fun.  Atleast I got to leave school early but even then I missed the one class I happen to like. Mr. Moser. I had to go to the orthidontist to get my braces cranked. lol. He put on this blue wire and i'm not sure if I like it or not. Oh crap! I just realized I have math homework. What a great day. Oh and if y'all wonder why I type so proper and all, I don't know why, I just do.
