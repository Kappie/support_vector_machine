I really don't care -- I'm tired of everything I put up with...     You might have rididculously impossible family members if...    1.  They always criticize you AFTER you so graciously fix their computers.    2.  They always criticize you WHEN you are so graciously fixing their computers.    3.  They always criticize you BEFORE you even begin to so graciously fix their computers!    4.  They always show their ignorance by pointing out that you "think" you know a lot more than        they do (when you really do!)    5.  They always love to make stupid little remarks that seem derogatory until you come up with        something a heck of a lot funnier...    6.   urlLink They use Xanga over Blogger when they know that their ignorance never triumphs!     7.  They say things behind your back that only reveals more stupidity and ignorance.    8. They make it look as if they know more about a particular subject to make themselves look more intelligent, when they know thoroughly that you will always win any battle in that        subject.    9.  They argue about things that they really have no bearings on themselves!    10.They make you seem worse than they are when around other family members.    11.They ask your opinion on things and really want to know what they should do (uh... the RIGHT way to do something) and then they turn around and do the opposite...    It's generally a rule of nature for family members to NEVER listen to you and understand what you are saying mainly because they CAN'T understand what you are saying because they are too busy talking about you behind your back...
