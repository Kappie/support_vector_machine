Yeah, I know I dont normally like parties, but when it is with a group of people I like, I love it. I guess being Mr. Anti-Social for the past 5 years dosent exactly make people want to invite me. I guess Im just a late bloomer. Also, even if I wouldent come, and Ariella knew this, she still should have invited me out of common courticy. It hurts when one of your best friends throws a party and dosent invite you. Anyway, I really hope that I will be Invited to the next one. Ive been talking to Reegan the past few days, she seems really cool. I dont know her that well, but I really want to get to know her better. She seems like somene I could identify with. Anyway, if any of you party planners read this, PLEASE INVITE ME! post again tommorow.
