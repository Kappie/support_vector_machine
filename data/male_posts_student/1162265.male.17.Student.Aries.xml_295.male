Because of this neither are the good good, nor evil evil, nor is life life, nor death death. For this reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. But those who are exalted above the world are indissoluble, eternal." -The Gospel According to Phillip  It's not that I'm anti-religious.  I think I have the mind of an Atheist, but the soul of a Saint.  I hate religion because of what it does to people, but I hate people who aren't religious because I find them ignorant.  I suppose that's because I've yet to meet anyone who thinks like me in the least.  But who would?  I change between all sorts of fringe religious beliefs like they're clothes.  I guess I realized that sitting in church, a very interesting situation, or when that black lady I helped Friday said "Keep going to church."    Maybe it's not even that.  I guess I don't hate what religion does to people, I hate what religion does to black people.  Yeah, that's more to the point.  I can't shake the concept that religion, actually Christianity, is nothing more then a slave religion.  I remember I was talking to Kelz and she said one of her friends worships her ancestors, and I was thinking "Far out, some kids still do have some sense." I really don't know though, I haven't really thought all day.  I've just labored for school, and for the household, and slept.  I still have another 40 note cards to do, but I'm not sure I want to do them.  I woke up in the middle of the night scared shitless about the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  I think that's pretty damn funny, it didn't do shit until I woke up at 5AM, and just thought about stupid white people being murdered because they were stupid in that movie.  Then I thought about a million other things, and I felt worse/better.  Haha.  All I can say is that after this week, I will do something so horribly stupid that the rest of my life will pale in comparisson.
