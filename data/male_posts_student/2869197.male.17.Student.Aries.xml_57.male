The historical arguments that the Fathers burned, tortured, and propagated strike hard. My limited knowledge of church history allow for these stories. But my worries were relieved after a single misstep: he said the Church was trying to cover up the Dead Sea Scrolls. Obviously this book was made before the Scrolls were fully translated as the Scrolls proved that an overwhelming portion of our Old Testament is perfectly aligned with the Scrolls. This fault brings into question his other light-hearted jabs which I will only fear after some unbiased study into church history on my part.   Another interesting twist is the feminism. Now, to be honest, the feminist movement frightens me. The days will soon be gone when a man can sweep his love off her feet and pile her high with compassion and gifts (monetary if you must). They are a dying breed of romanticism. If we view man and woman equal, no chivalry can't exist as the core of chivalry is the defense of the weak. I love such days. So as to prevent rabid women from lynching me in the street, the feminist movement has many good points. I firmly believe in equal pay for equal results (if you make a pound of X, you get Y dollars and nothing else). I even belief that in most areas of life (spiritual, mental, physical [in some case]) we are equal. The problem being my Bible has some cruelly chauvinist verses that hold me from true feminism. Like puddy in Brown's hands, that is just proof of the Church's persecution of the "sacred feminine". Even so, I feel some truth to them, some logic behind our sexually inclined differences and inequalities. In the end, the feminist issue is a deadlock for me now. I'm standing on the sidelines.  Friends. Female friends are deadly and merciless. They backstab, gossip, and mentally mutilate when you're not looking. Male friends tend to be nice enough to beat your ass to your face. Does that even make sense? Surprisingly, a large majority of my friends are girls. Does this mean I have a sweet spot for mental mutilation? No, I like girls for friends because they provide the discussion I crave. As a man, many of my points of interest are not "manly". I am not interested in cars, sports, military action, or lumberjacks (though one could argue the last one is feminine in nature). I love deep philosophical talks, delving into theology or epistomology or what have you. Women are more willing to talk about these things, in general.
