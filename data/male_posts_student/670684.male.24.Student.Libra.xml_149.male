And I come back to reality to see that diplomacy and activism and  disagreements in foreign policy  haven't stopped George W. from helping Lockheed Martin's stocks rise and utilizing  Shock  Awe  in order to depose Saddam Hussein.    I know I promised to stop talking war and write an essay, but I thought I'd have until March 31, Tony Blair's suggested deadline.  So blame him.  But the idea that we're saving the people of Iraq by inadvertantly killing thousands of them (which is what the US Government expects will happen as a byproduct of their war strategy) seems a bit off kilter.  I know that Iraqi life is not valued as much as Red-Blooded American life, but life is life, and if we are on a crusade of liberation, it would make the most sense to do this as quietly and pain-free as possible, rather than through a phantasmagoria of bombs that will destroy an historic city and render hundreds of thousands wounded or without adequate food, water, and shelter.    Since we're not concerned with the UN, and we aren't members of the International Court of Human Rights, why don't we just send in CIA cooperatives and assassinate Saddam?  Yes, state-sanctioned assassination is illegal, but so is unilateral war.  It's not deposing Saddam that angers the Middle East so much, it's 1)  the U.S seems to be as interested in flexing muscle as they are in deposing Saddam, and 2) a lot of innocent civilians will die, many many more than died in 9/11.    I'm tired of activism...we fight and fight and fight and our ally's military decides to  urlLink kill a protester .  They say on accident, but running her over with a tractor and then backing over her again somehow misses the idea of happenstance.  Nelson Mandela did not advocate terrorism, but he understood that signs and banners and rallies weren't enough...they could give you people for a movement, but public opinion means nothing when oppressed.  Terrorism is the next step; Mandela's group was interested in disrupting communication rather than War, and if it came to War it would be with militaries and governments, not civilians.  But how do we move past terrorism and to something else?  What is something else?  There must be something else?  We shouldn't have to kill people.    I think the reason we're going after Iraq (and Iran will be coming soon...mark that) is because we're afraid to look in the mirror and realize that our government treats the people of the Middle East in the same capacity (though modernized and covert) as South Africa treated the blacks during Apartheid rule.
