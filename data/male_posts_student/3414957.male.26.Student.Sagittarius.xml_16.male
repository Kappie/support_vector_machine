I almost seem like in a trance when I write down things that mean something to me. I feel weird. Like it took a lot of energy or something. I will post them on my poetry section soon. I wish I could write a happy poem or story. I guess I will when the words come to me. I shouldn't try to force happiness. That only gets you deeper in the pain department if you want to know my opinion.    I have a craving for some pasta right now but I can't do jack about it. I am the only one here so I can't leave to get anything. So I have been eating Starburst candies that I found in my backpack. Yum yum.
