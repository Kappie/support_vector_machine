Why must I feel this way  Just make this go away  Just one more peaceful day   It's been awhile since I could  Look at myself straight  It's been awhile since I said I'm sorry  It's been awhile since I've seen the way  the candles light your face  But I can still remember  Just the way you taste   But everything I can't remember  As fucked up as it all may seem to be  I know it's me  I cannot blame this on my father  He did the best he could for me   It's been awhile since I could  Hold my head up high  And It's been awhile since I said I'm sorry...
