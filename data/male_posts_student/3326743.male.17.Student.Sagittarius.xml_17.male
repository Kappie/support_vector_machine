Their is so much joy though in knowing God is sovereign.  I had some incredible joy just well up in me today.  I was listening to a song that talks about delighting in God and I was outside.  I just looked around me at the world and this wonderful satisfaction and happiness filled me as if to say that all I need to delight in is God and His gifts such as nature just point back to Him.  I would not understand glory unless I had seen nature.  Yet nature is just a small reflection of that infinite glory found in God.  God has given me an incredible desire lately for His return so that some times if I sense that a cloud has covered the sun I'll look up hoping to see Christ.  Their is never disappointment though b/c I know that it means there is a purpose for me staying and Him not coming.  I just have more hope that maybe next time He'll be there.  I'm getting closer to the end of  Desiring God .  I would recommend it.  It's not as long as it looks either.  If either of you want a copy then I can get you a free one.  Jeremiah keeps several copies at his house and gives them away.  He'll be glad to give you one.  Well, for now goodbye.  Lord willing I'll see you both soon.
