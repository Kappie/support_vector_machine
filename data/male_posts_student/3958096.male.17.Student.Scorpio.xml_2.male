In fact, politicans and the whole, meandering governmental process piss me off so much that a 3 is actually a pleasant surprise. A 5 in Chem will be far more useful in the long run. It would be nice to be accepted into Alma's pre-med program with Sophomore status, but for now I'm content with the way things are going.
