I didn't have any dreams last night :( I like dreams lol that sounded like Rosie and Jimthat i was watching theother day. The bloke who drives their boat(ragdoll) is called neil and he found outwhere honey camefrom. The honeyguy said: "helloneil, would you like to see where honey comes from?" Neil replies: "Ooooh yes please, I LIKE HONEY!" I thought it was pretty cool. I love having conversations with household appliances, have you ever tried to speak to your washing machine? I have and i'm telling you you're missing out on all the wisdom and knowledge that they hold. The other day it told me that the capital of Chile was Santiago it totally enhanced my outlook on life. I LIKE WASHING MACHINES! Dum de Dum I told myself that todays blog would be shorter so im gunna stop screwing your eyes up on my page and shove off  Tootleoo  Tom
