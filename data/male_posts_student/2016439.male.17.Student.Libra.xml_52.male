Last night, I had one of those "Ah!" moments when I was lying in bed doing my best to have a conversation with God/Allah/Him/Her/the Big Guy/Lady/Man Upstairs/Divine Spirit/whatever 1000 other names one can come up with for the Greater Conscience (wow, that sounded really Star Trek; guess I've been watching too much Deep Space Nine these last couple of days), and I came up with my post-Easter (which I haven't really officially observed for years) objectives: the three R's.  Yeah, I know, it sounds suspiciously like Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal promises, but I actually didn't realize it until after I'd made them.  Anyways, they are:  Resurrection Rejuvenation Renaissance  ...which all kind of boil down to my interpretation of the Easter holiday: resurrection of ideals/feelings, rejuvenation of fervor, and the renaissance: the "rebirth" of one's spiritual life.   I have yet to see if this will work, but I hope it will.  Maybe it'll start me on the road to the answers for which I've been searching for several years now so that I can find out what I believe and what I don't.  But on a much lighter note,  HAPPY EASTER!!!  Hope the Easter Bunny didn't scare you to the point of soiling yourself like one did to me so many years ago ;-)
