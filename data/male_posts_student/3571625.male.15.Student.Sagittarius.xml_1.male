Alex Box has been my best friend since probably somewhere around 2 years ago. our dads where good friends all the way through highschool and still are. im sure youll be hearing alot about him if you actually take the time to read my blog becasue we hang out everyday. Ive known taylor since first grade up to fourth and then i moved and we stopped hanging out now we go to southview toghther. And of course Jared Jakes one of the funniest akward kids i will ever know. i dont know how many words i can find to describe Jared. and no SILENT would deffinently not be one of them. Well im off to the Jcc wiht alex to ball it up, i think ive been getting alot better since ive been going everyday. see ya
