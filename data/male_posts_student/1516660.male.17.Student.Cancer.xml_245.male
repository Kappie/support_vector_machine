Wang Yu (who plays Zoe) won the Green Apple Award. Huang YiLiang (Tian DaHua) won Best Supporting Actor. Mo Xiao Ling (Mo LingLing) won the Best Supporting Actress (Yay!! Yay!!). Chen Li Ping (Mo WanWan) won Best Actress (horray!). Xie Shao Guang (Yang Xiong) won Best Actor. Woah!! So 'Holland V'-ish! I am so happy. One shocking thing was that LiPing didn't get into Top 10. Oh my god! How could she not? I bet she's crying now. Oh my!! I pity her man...how could she not win?  Oh. I forgot to add that yesterday's HZGG was the most touching story ever! Tears kept flowing down my eyes... HaHa! Seriously. The reconcillation, the forgiving, the pleas, the family warmness, all so touching! I love this episode, for it's the most touching and one where I cried the most. :)  Hey blog, you know what? Everything was back to normal between me and them. :) I am sure glad it did. I didn't know what made them to apologize. I am curious to know. Anway, I apologized too. After all, I did spark off some of the 'bullying'. YH even said that he would think before he says anything. That's good. This experience helped both parties to grow. Both parties learnt that 'bullying' is the worse thing you can do to a friend, intentionally or otherwise. I am glad both parties got out of this storm as better people.  Later, my parents are gonna buy me story books in Popular (using their 20% discount coupon). YaY! I got a list planned. I wanted to get  Five People You Meet In Heaven  and  Tuesdays With Morrie , both by Mitch Albom. I heard lots of good reviews from both books, and I am excited to read them. Don't worry, I'll be posting my reviews once I finish both books. I am also buying the three  Artemis Fowl  books by Eoin Colfer. I read a few chapters online and I am excited to read these books. :) I am such a bookworm. Heh heh!  Hmm..I think I go liao. It's 12 something, and my parents are not back from their shopping yet. I am hungry, and having a splitting headache. Ow! See ya later!
