Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Lean Back -Terror Squad Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #7 Ultimately an instantly recognizable smash, Terror Squad’s “Lean Back” is brilliantly biting gangsta rap that, above all else, pushes the message that Fat Joe can’t dance (which is good, because previously there were quite a few fans who thought that the Big Pun follower could bust a sick move). Over a thrilling beat that might as well have been penned by DJ M. Night Shyamalan (of “Sixth Sense” and “Signs” fame), Joe and partner Remy Martin rumble through their pasts, their presents, and Joe’s opinions on pop culture (“B2K crip-walkin’ like that’s what’s up!”). In 2003, we had to get low. This year, we only have to lean back. Thank god for that, because, if I may speak for us all, we need to save our thighs for other things.   The Verdict:  8.2/10 - The Fork   (4.1/5)     2004 Bubble Singles Club Entry
