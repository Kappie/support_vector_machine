(i myself distinctly recall wanting to be an astronaut) now that you are much older and wiser, do you still have the same answer to that question?  i can honestly say i no longer feel the desire to jump around the moon and ride in a spaceship (unless it involves a trichorder, a phaser and a skin-tight black uniorm... live long and prosper! lololololololol!). now, my answer is a lot more realistic.  i want to be a video game character. to be specific, a fighting game video game character. and, to be even more specific, i want to be an arcade fighting game video game character. okay, for perhaps the last time, for the sake of sheer accuracy, i want to be a snk arcade fighting game video game character.   for the less video game-inclined among us, snk is the company that created many fine video games over the years such as "fatal fury," "king of fighters," "art of fighting" and "metal slug." just think of it this way: their fighting games are like street fighter (i hope you all are familiar with that one, which was made by capcom) only, more often than not, with a whole lot more of the "cool" factor. case in point: capcom's coolest character in my opinion is akuma (aka gouki), whose main claim to fame is the absolutely bitching super attack "shun goku satsu." snk's coolest character is, well, a lot of them are uber-cool: iori yagami (dude, seriously? i gotta explain this one? "asobi wa owari da! koko made da!"/orochi/that damn scarlet hair), kyo kusanagi (what? the jacket oozed kewl), ralf (galactica phantom! yosha!), clark (that grab super is bitchin'!), leona (orochi, that earring bomb), orochi itself (for being orochi itself), krizalid (the costume was nice), seth (the all-purpose striker), kula (gots ta love the ice yo!), k' 9999 (for being a blatant akira rip-off), may lee (love those clothes), and mai (any hormonally-challenged male will remember her for her "maternal assets"...). i know that seems biased, but seriously, snk just plain has cooler characters. as we video gamers like to say, "'nuff said."  in any case, my mind is made up-- i wanna be a snk character. i want him to be an averagely built character with average-length spiky black hair and an aloof expression on his face. he will wear black pants, black shoes, a white shirt and a long, black trenchcoat (kind of like the one aoshi shinomori wears in ruroni kenshin, only black). he will have dark purple eyes. his main "catch" is his ability to generate white flame from his hands (as iori's flame is black/purple and kyo's flame is orange). his name should either be based on mythology or a short, uncommon word (like, say, zeitgeist or sumthin; as long as it sounds intimidating i really don't care what the name means, just as long as it's not something *too* stupid). he won't be a cheap character; he'll be average. he'll have some totally mad wicked sick insane combos, but they'll be so horrendously difficult that only the best of the best will be able to perform them at all, much less consistently. oh, but no infinites though; those suck. i think i'll make him, oh, the nth orochi-incarnate clone who is raised by a kind old japanese couple living by the seaside and the dude is a retired martial arts demi-god who trains me in the art of good though the evil blood within me conflicts this training and there is this deep internal struggle and i join the hero team to try and hunt down the forces that spawned my unholy existence. my ending involves sacrificing myself in order to save everyone else from a massive space station explosion as they escape in this little pod. ok, questions?  my character will have a sort of orochi form as well, the only difference comes in the addition of black gloves, a flame of recca villain-style silver mask where the eyes and mouth are shrouded in darkness, a blood red japanese character (a word for, oh, death, doom, melancholy, destruction... somewhere along those lines) painted at the back of the trenchcoat and a huge-ass deathscythe (say, it takes up a quarter of the screen) complete with ball and chain at the bottom of the handle. this form loses all the white fire-related moves, which are replaced with moves involving (what else?) the deathscythe. this one'll have slower ranged moves and less combo ability, but will have more power and a few added high-priority attacks. newbies will have an absolutely horrible time handling this character, so only serious tourney-level players need apply.  yes, that is what i want to be. thank you for listening to me, mr. snk man, whoever or wherever you are. i'm sure you will use my ideas well. no no, cash is not necessary; the glory and the fame are all i really need, so credit where credit is due ok?! *hem hem whispers* just address the check to [ub3r/L337]>>>:::X_ayrn_maydn_X:::  sincerely, a fan  completely wrong thought of the day: seriously, when i was in kinder i wanted to be an astronaut...
