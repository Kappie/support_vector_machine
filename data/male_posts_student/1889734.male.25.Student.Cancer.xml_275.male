I picked up Master and Commander after seeing the Russel Crowe film.  I've always been fascinated by the era of Tall Ships, and what it takes to fight them.  M was a fine movie, nothing at all like Gladiator (which was another fine movie).  It is not the action picture originally advertised.  Instead, it was an interesting look at the types of characters that lived this life.  Crowe was excellent in the role.  So I decided to tackle the entire Patrick O'Brien series of 20 novels.  We'll see how far I get.
