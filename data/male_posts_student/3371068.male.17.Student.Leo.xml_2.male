So im supposed to do stuff with my girlfriend and my friends tommorow. I should feel bad that im benifitting from this guys death with a day off but lukily i lost the ability to give a shit about alot of things in the past few years. My parents are stupid drunks and my brother's an egotistical fuck up with a single digit I.Q. I got in late last night and my parents went naturally balistic. I would have too. But they know how to push something until it's too far. They sit me there and yell at me about random mistakes i've made in my entire life for an hour and by the end of it i succesfully managed to teach myself to say entire sentences backwards in my head. Shows i was paying attention eh? I am still kinda iffy about this whole sharing my feelings on the blog thingy. I have alot of shit im not sure im willing to share where my friends can read it. Only two people in the entire world know this shit about me. Aw well. I'll try to improve my ability to randomly spit out thoughts without considering consequences. later.
