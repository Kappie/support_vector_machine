I mean what actually is time? its just something which man made up to help him. And life, as strange as this may seem, but from the day that we ourselves are born, we are actually dying, its a bugger isnt it! but enough of the negative stuff, might as well go back to the positive me the me which people always seem to prefer to the negative me, *shrugs shoulders* meh its a bugger isnt it
