The house has 2 furnished spare rooms, each with double beds, and one unfurnished spare room (empty).  There are also two couches and we'll have the use of a camping trailer in our driveway (it has a double bed and 2 singles).  Two tents will be available and we also have plenty of floor space.  If you want an idea of what the house is like there are before and after photos  urlLink here .  Should somebody really want to stay in a hotel there is one in Fruitvale called the Villager's Inn about 5 mins away - and I believe it is quite cheap.   The Area :  Here are a few websites that might be of interest if you want to get some insight into this area. 1) urlLink Fruitvale , this is where Adam  I live.  2) urlLink Trail , about 15 mins drive from us.  Has a small airport  is where we'll go if we go to a 'club'. 3) urlLink Castlegar , about 25-30 mins from us.  Location of another airport and other random stuff.  4) urlLink Nelson , a hippy-esque city about 1 hr from us. 5) urlLink Rossland , about 20 mins from us.  Home of the ski hill and gold mining museum.  6) urlLink Creston , about an hour from us. Home of the  urlLink Kokanee  brewery where we could do a tour should the thought strike us.   The Cost :  If you're coming from a country that deals in anything other than Canadian currency then you're in luck.  This area is extremely inexpensive so your cash will go much further (even compared to Toronto for all those who went to CAN2).  Even for other Canadians it will be relatively inexpensive. Obviously, the biggest cost is getting here - and then maybe the beer if you're going to have a lot ;)  If you are looking at ways to decrease the cost of you getting here, please feel free to ask as there may be some way we can help.  Until next time...
