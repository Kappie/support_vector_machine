Those are some of the best conversations I've ever had.  When a friend just decides that they want to talk to you and possibly for no other reason than to say "HI" and "I was thinking about you".  Now, I don't usually get those kinds of calls from friends.  They always have a purpose behind them, not malicious or anything, but usually it's to solidify plans or ask a question that I may know the answer to.  Today, I had TWO such phone calls... quite a record, I believe.  The first from a great friend of mine, and then the second a couple hours later from a new friend.  Just makes me feel all warm inside... kind of like a big gulp of a hot vanilla chai from  urlLink Live Wire  (a coffee place down the street from where I live).  I think I'll go get one and keep up this really neat feeling.
