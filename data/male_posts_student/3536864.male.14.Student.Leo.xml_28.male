I went to get evaluated and all that fun stuff on Tuesday; I got my ID card for the ymca (the team I'm at for the moment, might join bixby) and i got really tired. I was on my way to a friend's house to go hang out, but then I realized that we had to be at the Y in 20 minutes. That kind of stank, but it turned out okay. When I first got there, I had to swim freestyle for 5 minutes. I'm sure that's not hard for people that swim, but I haven't done any swimming like that in a year or two. I finish up and I'm pretty tired. Now they want me to just flutter kick down and back. I get critiqued and try again, and I have it down pretty good. Now for the freestlye drills. I need to work on my 1)Alternate breathing 2) Arm strokes 3) Not getting tired. After that I did the breaststroke, and the coach said I was really good at that. It's my favorite stroke because you're underwater for the majority of the stroke. The coach said that my leg\kicking was great, but my arms stank. I was given yet again more pointers (i needed them) and was sent down to the other end of the pool. My pointers, and back I went again. She said that it was almost perfect right then, but I know that I still need to work on it alot...not to mention endurance. I did the backstroke and some other drills, and some push off and and starting techniques. After all this, I got out, and got dressed and all, though I'm still wet and my shirt is soaked from the bottom to about 5 inches above that. In order to get my card I need to get my picture taken. Nice. I get my picture taken and lucky for me it wasn't zoomed to much. Chlorine takes it out of ya. Time to go and take a shower. I'm all chlorined out. Ciao!
