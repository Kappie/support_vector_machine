Today and then tonight was pretty boring.  Sat around most of the day.  Applied at Target.  Would be nice if I could get a job and get the new Sony ultraportable laptop coming out this month.  It's awesome.  Yeah.. if I don't get it for my birthday (probably not going to happen), I guess I'll just have to earn up for it the old fashion way.  In other news... Seinfeld rocks.  I'm going to try to archive the complete episode guide.  That would be tight.  I guess that or wait until they bring them out on DVD... which may never happen.  In other news  urlLink Elane  is hot.  There you have it.  I think I'm going to watch RoboCop now... or just go to bed.  Night.  I am listening to: " I Know What You Want (Radio Edit) (HitzRadio.com) " by  Busta Rhymes  Mariah Carey featuring The Flipmode Squad
