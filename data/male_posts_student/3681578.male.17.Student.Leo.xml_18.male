I'd better prepare for Mark's usual "start of topic" Surprise Quiz...hehehe...on maybe Point of View...  After Lit, I was not able to join my block for lunch owing to my need to deposit in a bank (my stipend)...so there, I had to hurry without lunch to SEC Lecture Hall C...I was not late at all, Ms. Aberin just caught me nibbling cookies from my bag...she even said "pasimple pa, huling-huli naman" but she was not angry or anything...  Later, she made me solve a problem on maximum velocity (note my "delight " at the thought of answering a physics problem)...well, it was an application of derivatives in physics and was actually easy...her examples are easy, contrary to Doc Mara's examples...which are exceedingly tough!  So anyway, she also gave us a quiz (two items) on derivatives pa rin, just to know if we understood how to plug stuff in the differentiation formulas...it was not bad...just long actually...  Afterwards came the tiring taekwondo session where we were asked to practice the first basic form with groups...our group did nice though not really nice-nice...um, just so-so  So there, Kindergarten was fun where someone discussed Implicit Function Theorem...it was actually nice because we had Reina and Patrick explaining (and/or subduing) the concepts in our math (just enough calculus to know what continuity and derivatives mean)...In my opinion, the theorem he presented was actually very evident...also, knowing topology was nice...of course there were the munchkins we were munching while the speaker was writing on the board...  So yun...after that medyo tiring day, I was not able to do work...  I'll post about this day later...
