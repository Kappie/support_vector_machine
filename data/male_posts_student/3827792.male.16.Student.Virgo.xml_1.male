I juz went to see the doctor and he said at least the virus has not worsen yet so i guess I went early so gt early detection. Ah, also, did i mention that the classmate whom I am damn pissed off with is trying to patch the frenship up again?? Well, too bad, if he had knew tat this would happened he would not have pissed me off in the 1st place. Somemore is he started it first and I was trying to hold my temper for kinda a while and he still cant hear the displeasure in the way i type my replies. So I guess he went to far and triggered my nerve that has been under controlled as compared to last ime when i would juz blow. Now at least I held it back before I burst. So I guess, a person's temper has got its limit. So I shall sign out here.
