This has nothing to do with what Tiffany said... Bitch... :: LOL j/k ::  ( No, in a way it does, but I  feel the same way.. ) Time to loose the Man-Boobs ( Moobs.. ) and start packin pecks..  --Now, i'm in no hurry, I just wanna get goin.. I mean, think of it this way:  "I dont do much outside of sitting around and working.."  I'll be all "Swole"... (Rofl..)  Next..  So, I got my login name   i'm all set to start my online courses for college.. ( Of course they start a day earlier than school does...  ) For some reason I wanna go back to school..  No.. i'm lyin..  Ha..  Guess I'm workin 5-9pm tomorrow too.. (no prob, more hours = more tax taken out)  wait.. ok, nvm..  (no, its otay.. I wike workin in tewls..)    Done..
