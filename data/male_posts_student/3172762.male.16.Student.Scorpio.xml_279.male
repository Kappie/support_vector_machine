Though you are an evil mistress of the underworld your face is that of the angels and your voice that of the sirens of the distant seas. The more I try to fight you the more beautiful you become. I hate you, yet love you. You are ugly, but beautiful. I hate every fiber of your being, yet to live without you is to not live. For there is nothing but you, only you, and nothing else.  And then as quick as the spell came it ceases. And the dark angel moves on to her next victim. Like an animal she feeds on her pray leaving the toils to rot. And I long for you. The portents of your memory appear everywhere. I see your empowering face in the lake, in the windows, and in the mirror. I hear your encantating voice in the wind, in the earth. To have you is to not want you and to want you is to not have you.  That is the effects of your spell evil mistress. You toil with the heart and at the end of the day, when it interests you no more, you throw it away like a spoiled fruit. Once ripe but then dead. So tread in other's hearts carfully; for to become a mistress of the underworld is to do so. The heart is the strongest and yetthe most fragile part of our being. Treat it well.
