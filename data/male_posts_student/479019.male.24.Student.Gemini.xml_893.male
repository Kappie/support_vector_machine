I'm from Irvine, and I don't think anything of people... much less Asians dressing punk. Then again I'm just one person out of the hundreds or even thousands that stare or think. To say that identity is socially constructed is theoretically sound, but that doesn't mean that the implications of the social construct doesn't have  actual  impacts on how people act and react to things. I had a debate about this with Inhye, and I argued that there is a real and unreal component to indentity. Ultimately it doesn't matter whether something exists in objective reality or if is a manifestation of our collective "imaginations," because we as individual subjects have feelings that in turn affect how we act in the material world.  That sounds like something pulled out of  Waking Life , which I saw with the girls last week. Good movie that I need to rent one of these days. There are a lot of movies I want to rent in the next week or so. I still need to see  Kill Bill  and  School of Rock .  Not a lot done today. Just rollerblading and cooking.  I am, however, annoyed with the breaking of many things.  The zipper on my nice leather jacket (purchased in 2001) broke off, and it has a tear in it. I'll probably get a new jacket as a result. My Swiss watch stopped ticking (purchased in 2001). I need to get it fixed this summer in LA. I dropped my coffee pot (purchased in 2002). A measuring cup (purchased a month ago). I think I'll make pizza for dinner now.  ***
