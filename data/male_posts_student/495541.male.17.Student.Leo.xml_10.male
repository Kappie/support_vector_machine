I am on my Mom's at the moment.  It's pretty old.  It's a Compaq Presario 2266.  Not really all that fast, but it's good for e-mail.  It's got a record uptime of over 6 weeks.  That's running Windows 98.  That's pretty amazing.  I even run my Genome@home program on it.  That gets a few work units done for my team.  As I look right now, it's about to finish a gene.  I'm ranted about 220 or so on the teams list.  That's not bad.  My computers in the lead on my team with about 230 genes I believe.  This computer has 60 or something I think.  Not bad.  My Dad also has his laptop hooked up to it.  He's got around 100 genes, I believe.  That's pretty cool.  I'm not sure what it's really doing, but it's cool to actually use the idle time of a computer for something.  Today I actually wrote some in my personal journal.  It was pretty weird after not writing in it in some time.  It's really interesting to read over what I had previously wrote in that journal.  I can really tell that I'm progressing in though and mental capasity.  It's clearly reflected in the writing.  Either that, or I'm just getting more mature.  I don't know.  Probably a combination of both, but no one can clearly tell.  Anyways, I was playing Counter-Strike as I said earlier.  That's a pretty fun game.  Not exactly all that fun when you play with people that are so good.  It may be that I am not skilled at the game or it's just that I haven't played in such a long time.  I can't tell yet.  I'll probably continue to play on the new server.  I know a couple of people from the clan so it's fun having a server to play on.  I'm going to see if I can get them to get one of my favorite maps, Jeepathon 6k.  Not many people like it but I used to play on it all the time back on the Nude clan servers.  That was great.  They used to play all kinds of crazy maps.  It was almost as if they wern't looking to be competative, but just to have fun.  Couple more days and it will be spring break.  I'm not sure what I will do durring the break.  I hope that whatever I do that it's productive in some way.  I know Christmas break, all I did was sit around all day and use the computer.  Now what sense does that make?  Not only does that rot my brain, but I get nothing done.  I'd really like to work on Halbe.org.  I've got a PHP book that I want to read and learn a bit of PHP for the new site.  I'm kind of wondering though, because I don't believe my host supports PHP.  Ultimatly, what I would want to do is host myself at my Dad's work.  They have a T1 line, I believe.  I'm sure they'd let me tap into it.  You may be thinking that that's not a good idea, but you just don't know they kind of IT guy my Dad works with.  He's a train smoker and he basically does nothing all day from what I hear.  He'd probably help me set it up.  I also wanted to run a my own Counter-Strike server, but I guess there's no need for that now that Counter Assassins have one.  I'd still like to know what it wold be like to completely control somthing.  It's just a power thing.  People always like to be in control of things.  I guess I have some of that in me.  I suppose I should just trust others a bit and just see how it is.  I don't know.  I probably won't get anything done durring the breat, but it makes no sense in just saying blah I'll be lazy.  I'm going to  try  to do something productive and just see how the whole break goes.  Well I really can't think of much more to say tonight.  I think I'm going to go to be now and listen to my Coldplay CD.  Good night.
