I had my best shot in my life - hole #5 167 yds (501 ft), used a 5 iron, shot it way in the air, the ball bounced next to the green, creeped up next to the hole...and stopped 1 foot short of the hole. I tapped it in for a birdie 2. After golf, I got XC shoes and start running XC for Perry tomorrow. Oh, a story to tell...There is a Catholic church her in Indy that has set up a gambling scheme...with the offering plate! One of Dad's co-workers goes to that church. The co-worker said you put a set amount ($5) in a special red envelope. Place it in the plate when it is passed around. When they are done collecting, they draw one of the red envelopes out and if it is yours, you win half the money in the plate. That's crazy!
