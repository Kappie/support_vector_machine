I feel the  Latino -ness just watching that channel for a few minutes.  It's like a Spanish MTV on Cable (not Sattelite to my knowledge), it's designed for  Los Jovenes Espanoles  and is soo... good.  Most of the shows are in English, but like  Siempre de los commericiales y mucho videos musicales son en Espanol  and yes I do think Spanish looks sexier in Italics.  Like one of the shows reminds me of MTV Hip-Hop or A bit like Rap City (the better of the two mentioned shows because it's not on M-oh-yeah-now-T-we-want-black-people-to-watch-us-V) with a female host as well.  It's pretty ugly, in a good way, and I seriously am going over to Aunty Claires (joke) to watch that all the time.  Oh.  Check out Guerillafunk.com, "Evil" the song is really tight.  You gotta hear it, the album is out in like six days.  And in the words of Dead Prez, "One thing about Music when it hits you feel no pain."
