Here's a recap so far:  Friday night the hurricane hits. My roommates and I, and some neighbors too, went play in the turrenical rains. It was fun, until the wind speeds got the rain to stinging speeds. Around 9pm, the power went out. Even with the hurricane having pasted right over, the tempature rose quickly enough. Without A/C, my apartment slowly warmed up. The next day, still no power. I worried that my food would melt if the power didn't get my refrigorator running again soon. The place was as warm as the outside, and Flordia is a warm warm place. Sunday, having suffered a night of Flordia heat I whine about missing all my Saturday cartoon and animes. Surely the power must get restored today in time to watch  Charmed  and  Deadzone.  Monday comes, another night of heated sleep and sweating the night away. Tomorrow I have class again and I can't decide how I want to handle that. Stay home being exhausted already from nights of bad sleep, or go to my A/C-ed college and suffer through Calculus. I choose to go to class, so at midnight I prefer for the hot night again. Tuesday I go to class. I'm barely awake. Our food as long since been ruined so I can't prepare breakfast. Lecture ends and I plan to go to McDonald's for lunch. But right before class ends, the power dies. A transformer blew nearby, taking McDonald's power with it. No lunch....Calculus labs are next. At the end of it all, I head home hoping for power. There is nothing....maybe tomorrow? Now it is Wednesday. I wake up to unbareable heat as the sun is brightly shining outside. I immediately decide I'm going to the movies to escape my torture. IRobot is a cool movie, but as it ends I grimance about returning home. But I need to check anyway....no power. I grab my laptop, and I head straight for here: Full Sail. I have A/C, I have the internet, I have few arcade games (Game design building is fun). But how long must I wait til I have power?
