My SAD is bad, but not as nasty as it was last year....i almost had a breakdown but than pulled it together. I haven't lost any weight...haven't gained any either. I am single. Least dramatic breakup ever. R. if you are reading this thanks for a fab couple of months. I had a lot of fun...but yes, we work better as friends. went to the MIA yesterday....i love art, and i had so much fun with k. giggling over the homo's who were strolling through....we didn't know weather to look at the art on the walls or that walkeing through the galleries. well kids nothing much else is new am broke got a raise that's it
