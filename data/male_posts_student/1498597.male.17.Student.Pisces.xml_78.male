Is it really that surprisin' that I'm up early (accordin' to my standards, its early)?  Or is it shockin' that I'm actually bloggin'?  Haha, well whatever is, just be glad I'm bloggin'!  OK, lets get this show goin'...!  How about that "possible" strike yesterday?  That was pretty interestin'.  You see, if  Nick  ever, ever, ever did that...I would be forced to go right over to his house, take my foot, and shove it as far as I could up his stupid little asshole!   Nick , don't ever threaten me with a strike ever again!  Hah, if its a strike you want, I'd be glad to strike, as in hit, you.  Hahah!  OK, I'm not really that angry about it, but I guess some part of me inside would really kinda be pissed off.  Right.  Lets be glad that the "strike" was avoided, huh?  Heh,  Nick , you demonstrated that this blog could go on even with just one writer...if you wanted to go on strike...well...J/K!  Speakin' of which, since  Nick  is gonna be headin' up north to  Washington , he leaves me in full responsibility of takin' care of the T.E.W.  Heh, only fair, since I was kidnapped by the fuckin' CIA for like how long...I don't even remember...Oh no!  Those fuckers drugged me!  I don't remember...uh...I...WHO AM I?!  Right.  I'm J.R., stupid...anyway, yeah I'm gonna be managin' the blog for the time bein' then.  Lets all hope  Nick's flight  is hijacked by terrorists and ends up crashin' in the ocean or somethin'...What?!   Nick  always says how much he loves the beach!  Hahah, OK man, have a good trip.  Seriously.  Haha, OK, thats kind of it for now.  I'll try to work on the blog.  Last time I heard that the idea of  Operation: Revolution  was catchin' faster than a deadly virus in Asia that came from an undercooked cat.  Right on!  Well, yeah, that means I havta work on both sites then...Busy, busy, busy!
