A part of me wants to lay in bed forever, and another wants me to try to enjoy things and get out.  Today I went to Julie's house and gave her a second guitar lesson, just something I have been doing for fun.  But I stayed there from 2 to 10:30, and just hung out and talked and reflected.  We watched Pi, a brilliant movie that I felt like watching again after seeing that same director's other movie: Requim For A Dream the previous day.  Which was good.  and we made cookies lol...  It was nice being with company.  So I think I know which side i want to be.  I am reaching out to friends now and I just want to start seeing them again.  I want to start writing music again.  I want to be creative, I don't want to be what I was after my last relationship.  I could never survive being like that.  I am also going up to my cottage tomorrow for two days.  When I come home, I hope you guys are willing to go out and see movies and stuff cause I still want to see Spider-man 2 and Anchorman.  The problem is, I will never forget Kate, and I loved her deeply, and I don't know if I can get over it.  We were together for 6 months, and all I can think about is all the things we did...  This will be difficult, gimme a call if you wanna do something (734-968-2200), anytime, I dont care, i just need to get out...
