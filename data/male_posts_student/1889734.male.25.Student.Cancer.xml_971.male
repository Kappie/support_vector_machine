Trying to view this from the perspective of a campaign manager, wouldn't it be far easier and more effective to just refute the charges by releasing medal citation records or other service records to set the facts straight?  Seriously, trying to be non-partisan for a moment....why not just blow away the allegation rather than attack the messenger?  Yeah, I know both sides do it, and I hate it when my side does it as well.  But wouldn't it be better to use the facts of Kerry's service instead?   "The Democratic National Committee has reportedly created a 'Brown Book' that contain what has been described as 'damaging military records, personal credit histories, medical histories, psychiatric histories, divorce records ...'  A DNC insider is reported to have said 'We've got the goods on the veterans who oppose Kerry.'  Word is that some of these books have already been delivered to Kerry-friendly reporters."
