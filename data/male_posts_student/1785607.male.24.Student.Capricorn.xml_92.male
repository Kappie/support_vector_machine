Sad is when there's so much to say, so much to live for, so much to share and no one to be there for you.   Well, I'm here again.   You know! Everything feels the same, the same boring and lifeless day. Though many things have changed and in many, many ways I'm not the same; at heart, my mind still lingers where it should not [ Adrian ].   Lost is Liam. Yesterday we had a conversation after three weeks without seeing each other and our relationship pop as a conversation theme. He made a bold move and asked me to be his boyfriend; and it seemed that the "partner" topic was left in the past. I kept eating my steak and did not answer.   Adrian has come to visit me two times now, once a week. The first time, first time since we left our business undone too, was a shock. My knees almost gave and my heart and speech were one of a 85 years old guy. At first I did not know how to react, how to behave, I tried to be as cool as possible. I tried. The second time around I had Liam on my head, and did not know what to do, our date was closer and closer and as he said [ Liam ] "we needed to talk". I was rude to Adrian, I was rude to Liam.   As conversation with Liam at dinner continued, with me still not answering, he told me to be calm and listen. Apparently, well, not "apparently", he was dating someone this last weeks, so was I. We were not exclusive and we were playing the field, as small as it may be for me. It did not work for him. As long as we were in our confession mode I told him about my visitor. Then something I did not see coming, happened. He stood up, went to the bar and spent a long time away. It all ended. He did not want to be there nor did I. It was goodbye.   Goodbye, there's a sad word. I hear it and breaks my heart. It takes love and takes it fast. At the end he told me he'll be there when I need him, no matter what; but it was time to move on. He kissed me and said Goodbye.   Che Gelida Manina. I listened to it when I realized Adrian was not who I thought he was. Che Gelida Manina. Liam and I listened to it the first time we spent the night together. How fucked up am I? So much that I just want to hear again:      Che gelida manina! Se la lasci riscaldar.  Cercar che giova? Al buio non si trova.  Ma per fortuna e una notte di luna,  e qui la luna l'abbiiamo vicina.  Aspetti, signorina, le diro con due parole chi son,  chi son, e che faccio, come vivo, Vuole?  Chi son? Chi son? Son un poeta.  Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo.  In poverta mia lieta scialo da gran signore  rimi ed inni d'amore.  Per sogni e per chimere e per castelli in aria  l'anima ho milionaria.  Talor del mio forziere ruban tutti  i gioielle due ladri: gli occhi belli.  V'entrar con voi pur ora ed i miei sogni usati,  ed i bei sogni miei tosto si dileguar!  Ma il furto non m'accora poiche,  poiche v'ha preso stanza la speranza.  Or che mi conoscete parlate voi.  Deh parlate. Chi siete? Vi piaccia dir?     La Boheme. Giacomo Puccini..
