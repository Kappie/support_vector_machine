Ya know i really think that life is alright if u have the right attitude and somethin to look foward to. But ya know, sometimez i jus get those feelinz that jus bug the hell out of me and jus totally comez out of nowhere, maybe cuz i think thingz through a lot, i jus basically try to solve my problemz by thinkin them through or jus seein where some of the stuff i think about is headed. Im probly jus confused about certain stuff thats all, neva know whatz gonna happen next or like the unexpected suddenly doez happen...i jus have to b prepared to handle all situationz, good or bad...idk, im jus feelin lonely thats all i guess...somehow me helpin other ppl leadz to me jus bein alone again. I'm jus basically tired of being alone, i jus want to find that special someone that is out there and jus waiting for me to jus take her into my armz and give her the love that i truly want to give...but that also takez more patience which leadz to more loneliness...thats the price i pay for the feelinz that i have and for the feelinz that i want to release...that is how i feel...
