They had a sub so right when Tyke walked to the classroom he decided to go back to his car and pick up a deck of cards.  So they started playing that but the sub was really against them doing so.  So they put up a bunch of folders as a little protection.  That didn't work too well but she didn't bother them for a while.  Then when she came back around they did some card tricks and then she started talking about how UW is cheaper than WSU (which is a lie) and then just kept blabbing on.  How come substitutes generally talk a lot?  Like about random shit?  The kids never care really.  Oh well, it is 98% of the time better to have a substitute than the real thing.  After cards they started drawing pictures.  Man those things were funny.  Tyke was laughing non-stop hard for at least half of the period.  It was a great start to the day.  But now Tyke will have to do his math hw after he blogs.  Shouldn't be too bad though.  2nd period was not worth mentioning.  3rd period hardly involved anything blogworthy but it had its ups.  Not many downs in the period.  Other than the fact that Dotti wasn't there.  That class can really be fun though.  4th period, another class that can really be fun but seldom is.  Today wasn't too bad.  No quizzes or anything like that so obviously it can't be too bad.  But there is a quiz tomorrow and that one won't be fun.  Tyke and Purdy passed some notes and wrote a "round robin" poem.  They just wrote a line and then passed it on to the other person.  It sucked.  Tyke wanted it to be semi-serious but when you start out with "Buxom chest bouncing in the breeze" you aren't going to get a very serious poem.  Mainly it was just a time filler until lunch.  Tyke and the crew piled up in White Lightning and bumped to BCL's Celebration of Black History Month while cruising on down to Subway.  It was really a great lunch.  That sandwich is soooo good.  After leaving Subway Tyke took a fantastic route.  He was coming back and saw a car in the right lane at a red light that wasn't turning right.  So Tyke put on the brakes and cut into the Ross parking lot and took a shortcut there.  Damn, that was a great read.  Then he cut in front of some cars and managed to hit the left turn green light on Newport Way.  He is just a great navigator.  Except for when he was going to park at Dick's.  Minor screw up in the turning on that one.  But he was the first one to see it in the first place.  So it balances out.  5th period is really one of Tyke's two most boring classes.  He just hardly gets to talk at all and he only has one person to talk to anyway and thats Macaroon.  And talking to Macaroon is like talking to a girl.  Oh wait, no that's getting blocked by Macaroon is like getting blocked by a girl.  Or at least that is what Tyke likens it to.  6th period was adequate enough to not be deemed bad.  In other words, it was ok.  A little quizzy wizzy in there which Tyke probably did poorly on but he doesn't care.  School now is all about having fun in class.  That is really all he cares about.  He is doing some of the homework but only what he wants to do.  So yeah, he's really gearing himself up for college!  After school Tyke came home and ate a little bit and got ready for his dentist appointment.  Because he takes care of himself, he had no problems with his teeth, as you all are probably dying to know.  He is going to have to have his wisdom teeth out though.  This summer in fact.  Probably mid-July to early August.  Or somewhere between getting back from Europe and going to college.  His summer break really isn't going to be that long.  School starts up August 23rd for him.  Yep, that is early.  A day before his 18th birthday in fact.  So he will be illegal when he heads off to college.  He'll be illegal for a while.  Only once school starts will he become legal.  Let's say legal one more time.  Legal.  Speaking of legal, 16 more days.  15 probably by the time you read this.  It's fun to do countdowns.  That's why he's doing this one.  Or at least he says the number of days a lot.  Upon coming home from the dentist he talked with his mom a lot.  They carpooled as his mom wanted to do some shopping and the area and that way traffic wouldn't be too bad because they could bypass it.  But they talked about like college and stuff.  Then they started talking about drinking and all of that stuff.  And what Tyke wanted to see in Europe and about going and drinking in the pubs there and just a bunch of stuff.  It was pretty fun actually.  Then they talked about his mom's stupid experiences in college and just weird stuff.  But it was cool.  So then Tyke came home and ate Chinese food which was really good and hung out for the night.  He hasn't talked to anyone online today in fact.  Probably because he is signed off.  That could do it.  But now Tyke is going to do his only homework he wants to, math.  And then go to bed.  And hopefully get about 9 and a half hours of sleep.  That would be nice.  Fuck what I said, it don't mean shit now.  Fuck the presents might as well throw em out.
