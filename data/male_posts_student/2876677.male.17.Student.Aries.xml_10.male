The words said in the hallway, the songs sung, the movies that are talked about are all definitely not what God has for my ears.  It is upsetting.  Everyone in my school is so liberal and they just keep drifting.  Socioeconomically, they are somewhat conservative, but on a lifestyle or faith basis they are following the world from a distance.  A distance that seems to shorten as time goes by.  I pray that the Holy Spirit will make some changes in the school as a whole.  Spiritual edification is not even thought of.  It would be awful to think that maybe the movies are wrong.  Maybe I should study it out in the Bible and pray about it.  Instead, I will bask in my sin and call the person who would make such a claim a backwards idiot stuck in the 1800s.  Definitely what "Christians" should say about each other.
