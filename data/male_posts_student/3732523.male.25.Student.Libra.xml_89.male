A year ago this time, I think 90% were made by myself, Madness and Star.    I'm watching the Greece-Czech semifinals in the Eurocup.  I have actually found the Eurocup football more interesting than the World Cup even without no American team. I am beginning to think that the final, which ironicaly, will be on July 4th, will be the closest thing Europe has to a superbowl.  For the 4th, it appears that I will be spending it in France.  Oh well, like Switzerland or Liechtenstein make any more sense.  I just got a new IPod today.  This is my 5th MP3 player in 4 years.  Although it looks the classiest, I am somewhat disppointed in that it does not allow you to delete files directly from the Ipod (have to use iTunes) and that it appears to want to connect to only the first computer you initialize with.  This sucks as I was hoping to use it to swap music around various computers.  We will see..I have already read about ways around this.  Ok..Melia..there you go. I am back :)  Happy? ;)
