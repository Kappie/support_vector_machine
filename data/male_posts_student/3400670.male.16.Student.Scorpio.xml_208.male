The math camp has elevated my life to a new dimension, with numerous epiphanies occuring and many new friends and bonds made. And many valuable lessons I've learned from math camp, including the fact that I felt incredibly stupid when I was immersed in a sea of of 23 geniuses.  And how important friendship and "constructive" competition is. And that's besides all the six week full time math we learned.  I miss the university setting soooooooooooooooooo incredibly much!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just be a college student and live in the McMahon dorm from now on for the next few years! Home only brings me the memories of stress, depression, loneliness.............and what not. While the math camp at the university was completely motivational, stress-free, fun......Fun together with learning/bonding experience.  Otherwise, the ASB retreat was mostly a taste of what we have to do next year, the responsibilities we have, the goals we have, and the people we are going to working with. It was quite interesting.........We'll see next year............Although I seriously wish Ms.Clark was still here!  Thomas Chen
