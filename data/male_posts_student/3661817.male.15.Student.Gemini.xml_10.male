Buy it! No matter what type of music you like.... well..unless you like rap...then well, your screwed.  After that we went to my aunts house, say some family, ate some food, hung out, listened to my CD, and suprisingly didnt get in a fight with anyone.   On my way home with my mom (my dad was performing at COntinental Arena for a doowop fest) she decided to buy a digital camcorder. I didnt object, considering im going to use it more than them.  And when i get home, i walk around for a bit, get a drink, go to the bathroom, sign on to aim, and wahts awaiting me? An invite to GMAIL BETA. I was phyched, so now   I have a GMAIL Acount thanks to my good friend ICE (YOUR THE MAN ICE).     Want to email me on my gmail account?  voididentity@gmail.com  o yeah! well, i will post more later.  Until Next Time.
