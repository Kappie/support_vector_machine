To be honest, I didn't think I'd get as many responses as I did so quickly. I'm glad to see that there are different ideas about this topic. In response to the Anonymous poster's request, I feel that predetermination or fate is something that perhaps we cannot fully grasp, a destiny or path set before us by an unseen power or being, the purpose of which we may never truly know. I believe that free will is different, though not opposite from this, in that it is a simple decision-making tool that we regularly exercise, void of any real understanding of predetermination.   We cannot know what our destinies are, short of having congress with an oracle, living off the words of a fortune cookie, etc. Therefore, the everyday decisions that we make are in fact an exercise in free will, even if beyond all of it we were already predestined to make the decisions anyway. It is the fact that we cannot understand our destinies that makes our will free, because we truly do no know any better.   In response to the second anonymous post, even in choosing to end your own life, up until the moment you pass from this existence to the next (or whatever you may believe), I feel as though you cannot truly know if it was fated or willed. We can believe in free will, in consequence, in chance, and in doing so live our lives thinking we have complete control of our decisions and destinies. But my understanding of predetermination is that we can live our lives in such a manner anyway, and still be fulfilling a fate that already decided we were going to do as such.   And if we did have some measure of insight...if we knew our fate ahead of time, how would we truly live our lives? If we did not like the way things were going to turn out, could we truly change them? Or would our exercising of our free will to change our fate be truly just predetermined anyway?  All of this can really make your mind run in circles. :)  Thank you to everyone who posted replies to this topic. I'm going to shut my trap now and get on with my day, but again, thank you. I hope I can continue to provide thought-provoking ideas, and that people continue to respond. I have to figure out just how people are finding my Blog (short of my friends that is), and start reading other people's ideas too. Until next time.....
