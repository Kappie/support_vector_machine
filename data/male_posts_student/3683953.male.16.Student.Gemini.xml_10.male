I always have a blast talking to Mike and Brad but today was especially fun (I don't know why it was but it was). Oh wait, I think I know the answer to that question, LOL. I think it was because I was talking to Mike, Brad, Hrayr, and John all at the same time, LOL, LMAO. But more to Mike and Brad. Hrayr is in Armenia right now having fun (sniff sniff). Luckily for him, the drinking age isn't 21, so he gets to drink too. (Damn) And even more, there are cute guys in the group that he's traveling with so it's like totally UNFAIR! I haven't seen a cute guy in person for months now. No wait nevermind, that was only last week. I saw a cute guy at the mall. Haha, LOL, LMAO. And well John is always cool to talk to. I can't say enough about him.   Now back to Mike and Brad. As I said,talking to them is always a blast. Mike is so funny and so is Brad. The subject of tanning is always fun to talk about with them. I'm dark, Mike's white, and Brad probably has the colour me and Mike both want, LOL. Anyway Mike opened up, which was good, 'cause it's always good to open up to people when you got stuff on your mind. When he said that we were like family, we as in the people that visit his board everyday, it made me feel good. I don't know, I guess I always feel like I'm excluded from a lot of things and end up feeling like the outsider or the dreaded loner. Guess it felt nice to feel like I belong somewhere for once. But it is true, sometimes Mike, Brian, Eugenia, Bill, Joey, Brad, Rich, Eli, and CF and Poochdo feel like my family, sometimes my only family. What was cool too, was that I got Bill's cell number, so that actually lets me talk to three members of my big online family [Rich, Joey, and Bill].  Nous sommes un famille . I don't know if I'd be the person I am today, without them. They've helped me so much in so many different ways. It reminds me of that great show from the 80s called  Family Ties (1982-1989) . It's a great show, you should all watch it. Here's the theme song:     "I bet we've been together, for a million years   And I bet we'll be together for a million more.   Oh it's like I started dreamin' on the night we kissed   And I can't remember what I ever did before.      What would we do baby without us?   What would we do baby without us?   And there ain't no nothin', we can't love each other through   What would we do baby without us?   Sha-na-na-naaah."      And on that note, I never knew that I also was helping Mike. I was astonished when he told me because I never thought that I, the short, sixteen year old kid from California could help someone. But I guess there's a first for everyting, right? (Wow that was sooo cliche-ish.) But ya, as you can see, my day overall was a pretty happy one.  Je suis tres heureux.    SONG(S) OF THE DAY:  Me Voila - Bryan Adams,   She Will Be Loved - Maroon 5,   It's Hard To Be Me - Cyndi Lauper
