Still haven't prepare songs and stuff for tomorrow. Guess maybe I'll do it tomorrow. So excited about this Saturday. Just messaged Min and Jie a bit. Then went to Kent Ridge Guild House with my family. Just went there and bathe then eat dinner only la. Ok...what a boring day. At least I got lots of rest.Ok...hope I'll be back here tomorrow again.
