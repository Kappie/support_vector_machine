One of the lines of the song goes, "Don't tell me how to be, 'cause I like some suffering.  Don't ask me what I need, 'cause I'm just fine finding me."    I think this is totally how some of us live - for some inexplicable reason we actually WANT to be lost, actually want to be suffering because we don't know what our purpose is and/or because we aren't fulfilling it (for many people, this means "being" a Christian but not really embracing what being a Christian means and entails).  There is some strange comfort in being that way, perhaps because it's what we're used to, or perhaps because we know we have no responsibility in that place.  Whatever the reason, we know it's destructive, it's not how things are meant to be, and yet it is so human-like to simply sit there and rebel, to arrogantly bask in our ability to choose to be lost.  Such a strange concept - to be knowingly lost, to know that we can find our way (even if we don't exactly know what it is), and to simply choose not to search and/or find that way.  Most of us would be completely content to stay in that position if not for a small voice in the back of our head telling us that it isn't the way things were meant to be, that it isn't what we were created for, that there is something better out there, that we could be so much happier if we would just do what we know we ought to (even if we don't necessarily know what that is, we know we could find out).  And that small voice is precisely why it's such a painful position, why rebellion is usually so unsatisfying.  Without any outright comment we know that we are half-empty vessels not really living up to our potential, and in doing so not really embracing the essence of our humanity, not to mention the essence of ourselves (i.e. personally).  I'm not really sure what I'm trying to say here except that I really wish that more of us (myself included, btw) would just get over this crazy lifestyle and philosophy.  Living like this isn't really living - it's slowly dying, it's wasteful, it's downright sad.  A lot of the time when I'm talking with people I get this sense that there is a great hesitation which pervades their entire life and holds them back from doing what they know is right, or from doing what they've always wanted to, and I think that in many instances this great hesitation is a fear of finding out who they really are.  Because to find out who we are would be to confront the purpose we were made for, and to confront the purpose we were made for would force an explicit choice on whether to live like that or not, something we don't want to face.  But it is something we MUST face, something that in the end will give us the greatest joy and happniess and peace that we could ever imagine if we would just embrace God's plan for us and the way He wants us to live wholeheartedly; at the least it is something that would force us out of our catatonic states and inject a life we didn't know before.  And I think this is something we all yearn for more than anything else, we just have to get over ourselves and accept it
