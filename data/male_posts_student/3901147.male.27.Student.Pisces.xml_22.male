You can't ask for a better way to start your morning! *cringes*  No really, I am having a consultation about a testicular cyst removal via surgery. As well as talk about a few other things that are a result of my infant mutilation I mean childhood circumcision. Wish me luck and I hope you all have me in your prayers.  Rob
