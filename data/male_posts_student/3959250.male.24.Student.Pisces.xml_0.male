Friday was nice, no classes so could go out with my hubby for dinner (i had tiong bahru fish porridge, alvin had korean bbq)/ walk walk at parkway parade ... my colleague, eT took bus with me from office and walked with me to PP since i so suaku didn't know my way there. I am still continuing my lunch-time exercise routine with a gorup of 5 colleagues - it's the Ancient Secrets of the Fountain of Youth. we practice the 5 rites ... woke up late on sat morning, nice mmm was raining (i love rainy days - makes the home really cosy) .. did not go swimming with my godchildren as decided to go do something to my hair .. after so many years of long hair, decided to chop it off .. plus colored/ hi-light! felt good to have short hair again ... spent the entire afternoon, but hubby was nice, waited with me since its his friend's salon and they yak and yak. Tonight going to watch midnight movie King Arthur - its showing at 12.20am .. *yawn* will be sleepy .. monday meeting classmates for revision but i guess will end up as a tok tok session .. chatted with melly, sue, noormie and josh last night - it's great fun chatting wif this group of ppl.. also had a good chat with kelly (in sheffield) ... tmr - not sure wat we are going to do, maybe going to my uncle's house in sembawang ..  next week will be hectic week for me at office gotta be prepared .. dat's all, must start to do my PR assignment or else cannot hand in on 29 Jul ... that's all for now .. cheers
