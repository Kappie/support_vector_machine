Myshithead boss goes ahead and schedules me, damit. Oh, and he decides to make me the closing manager. I'm sorry, do I ever close? Do I know how to close anything but fucking lobby? Um, no. Do I know how to do deposit or even bag tills for that matter? Hell no! And who am I stuck with the whole night?  SON OFA BITCH!!!!  Is Mr. Bossman even there when I arrive, in case I needed any pointers at all? No. Our close went about as good as... hell, there isn't anything to compare it to. Now, the morning crew are going to bitching me out like hell because 1) Deposit wasn't done 2) Their beloved 'extras' weren't done either 3) Truck decided to come in the morning instead of tonight. (Hell, the people who were scheduled for truck didn't even decide to show at all.) and 4) Our close sucked. Bad. I'm going to be expecting a call tomorrow morning that will go something like this.   "Hi, is Pbre home?"  "Yeah, this is me."  "Pbre, why wasn't deposit done last night? And why was labor so bad?"  "Don't blame me. Hell, I did my best. Blame Spitshine for scheduling me."   And that is going to stop there.   I have found that the past few days, weeks perchance, have not been the best for me. I really would like to just sleep for a long while. Wake me when I'm 22. But yeah. I have been very very fucking stressed out for the past few days.   I have figured out that the Academy is going to be a very very very longshot. Hell, just getting the senatorial nominations will be a feat in itself. The senators are only allowed 5 nominees each. Same with the Rep. That means that already, Ihave a 1/15 chance of being nominated. I'm sure that not all candidates have waited until the middle of the summer to start trying for the Academy like I have. These senators want a shitload of stuff too.   Example:  Congressman Collin Peterson wants:  1) A military Academy Application.  2) A transcript of high school record.  3) ACT scores at the EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE. Wish I would've known that when I took them.  4) Two letters of recommendation. I have talked to my asshole boss about writing one for me but I'm sure he isn't going to do shit. I have no idea who to go to for the second one.  5) 1 page essay of why I want to go to the Academy.   And his is the easiest nomination process from what I have read. Dammit, I am becoming very discouraged about the place. My backup plan is to go to UND AFROTC but, not to sound snotty, with my ACT scores, I would like to try for someplace better, more prestigious perhaps. But I don't know where else to apply to. I even came up with a poker metaphor for my chances of the Academy but we aren't going to see that now.   Lately, my parents have beenthe worst ina very long ass time. I really don't know what to do anymore about my home life. It's getting to the pointwhere, whenever I am home, I am completely emotionless. If I ever showed emotion, it would most likely end up becoming close to an all out anger or all the wayto tears,two things I try to stay away from.   This brings me to something else. I'm a person who is always thinking about the future, what it holds and all that good stuff. That's mostly what I think about whenever I happen to zone out, which happens more than is healthy most likely.But anyways, what I'm getting atis howI have heard from random sources that a parentwill usually act as a parent basedon their own parents.Does that make any sense to anybody? But, what I'm saying is,does that mean thatifand when I become a father, am I going to be a major asshole like my own father?Thisactually scares me. I really do not want anybody else tohave to go through what I am. I realize that at least I am not an Ethiopian child who wonders if they will be waking up in the morning, but be realistic here. I'm definitely not looking for sympathy here by the way, just to clear things up.   But I don't know anymore. I have so many things going through my mind right now, work, Academy, parents,and even otherissues.I try to be optimistic about things, but that's starting to become a chore and a half.   I'm sorry for this post people,I just needed some way to let it out. I'm done now.
