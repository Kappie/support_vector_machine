Do what you must.  Yell, scream, beat the living shit out of somebody...just stay out of my way.  My mother and I were talking and I came to the conclusion that I really wouldn't have any problems with being alone.  I mean, no one else on earth, I think I would be just fine.  Unlike most I don't crave the attention, I don't need it nor do I want it.  I am perfectly content spending time in the peace of isolation.  I also decided that I could kill a person if it weren't for the religious implications. I would only be able to kill people that I felt deserved it.  I am not bothered by blood and gore, and I enjoy seeing people that cause others misery, in pain.  If it weren't for hell, half of Taylorville would be dead.  But since the church won't be changing its policy on murder anytime soon, it looks like the world will live another day.
