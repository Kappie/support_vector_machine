My seniors are gone. no more professional bass trombone sounds will echo and vibrate the hall. no more her. no one to guide me. no one to disturb andreceive comical results. less friends. smaller world. Yet there is a lack of a sense of sadness within me.. i am not sad to see them go. neither am i happy of course, except happy for them.. because i believe they left with fond memories of our band. but what could be the reason that i do not feel their loss? maybe it stems from the fact i'll probably still see them around school.. or that they'll be coming back to visit us for a practices. we, the j1s are now officially in charge.. or the j1 committee at least. didnt get a post.. didnt expect one.. but i believe the new committee was well chosen. it was a time of warm goodbyes on July 27th. it marked the first time i had ever given my wonderful seniors presents.. and the look on their faces was reward enough.. i swear they looked like they weregonna go home and cry.. not that i blame them or think its sissy of course. as i write this, i realise i feel sad NOW. not then.. the euphoria of saying goodbyes and present giving must have overcome this feeling. its painful to know that no longer will we play together - maybe once more- but thats it.. the short less-than-1-year has drawn to a close. its damnn fast if u ask me.. i couldnt have been to more than 30 practices and *poof*- they're gone. shes gone too.. probably wont ever see her.. maybe its for the best.. its time to start being realistic.. and goal oriented. bleah.. what crap. i am sad now.. but i guess i can finally commit things to god.. yes i do believe there is one.. if it is what itis meant to be.. it will be.. and if its not.. well. As life with them draws to this chapter.. i remember.. i am no longer from maris stella.. its time to be a real part of acjc.. band. what the hell.. sounds like the compo i wrote for o levels.. bloody sentimental crap.
