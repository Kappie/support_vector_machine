Chicken and green pepper, fresh prawns, shredded fried potato, chinese bread, egg and tomato soup and some courgette. Suffice it to say, we were quite full!  After relaxing a while, yuqi and i went for a walk around the local area. First stop was the bank, to get enough yuan for a few days. The bank clerks had clearly not had much (any?) experience with english currency and wouldn't exchange yuqi's 20 pound notes because of a small rip in the top. The exchanged 200 pounds of my travellers cheques ok, the rate is a favourable 1 pound to 15 yuan, giving me more than 3000 to play with. Next, we took a taxi to a local travel bureau to book train tickets for our next city visit; shen yang. Tickets cost 237 yuan for a night sleeper service as the journey is about 12 hours. The clerk didn't understand my chinese and was quite rude, but yuqi sorted it all out :) finally, we walked back along the busy shijiazhuang side streets. I'd forgotten how unusual it is to have a foreigner in some areas. Most people stopped what they were doing just to stare at me walking past. It's definitely a strange feeling, and destroys any sense of settling in. Anyhow, i'm not too worried, i'll get used to it... I did last time i travelled to china.
