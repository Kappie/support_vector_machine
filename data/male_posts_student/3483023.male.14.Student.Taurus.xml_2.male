Not Really Any Point To The Show, But It Does Take Up Time. I Don't Think I Am Doing Anything For The Rest Of The Week Either, I Will Eventually Get Around To Reading My 'Kansas State Driving Book' Thing, But The Book Is So Long And Has So Little Letters, LOL, Its Boring And Stupid! All You Need To Know To Drive Is Green Means Go, Red Means Stop, Yellow Means You'd Better Hurry Your Ass Off Or You Have To Stop And The One Thing You ALWAYS Need TO Remember If Your In A Accident You Always Say ' I DIDN'T DO IT ' And You Never Ever Ever Admit To Doing It! I Am Off To Go Do Something Interesting... Change Out The Laundry, LOL... C YA'll Next Time!
