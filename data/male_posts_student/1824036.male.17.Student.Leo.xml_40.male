Years later, I decide, "Damn the cost", I'm going to check out RAW, which would be broadcasting live from the Arena at Gwinnett Center, down the road from my house.  The show was billed as being from Atlanta, but in reality, the show emanated from Duluth, GA.  But who's looking at a map, right?  I call my regular cab driver and he picks me up around 5:45PM.  I tell him I'm going to the Gwinnett Arena.  He says, "You're going to see that wrestling?  I just dropped one of those lady wrestlers off at the arena."    "Who?"  "I don't remember her last name, but her first name was Stacey."  "Keibler?"  "Yeah, I think so.  Nice legs, she was staying at the Fairfield Inn."  "You mean to tell me that my ass is currently occupying the same spot that Stacey Keibler's ass was five minutes ago??"  And that was pretty much the case.    Anyway, I got to the arena right before 6PM and headed straight to the box office.  The cheap seats were sold out, but I could get a $32 seat that was still available.  I snatched it up. (Turned out it was a good buy as the arena sold out shortly thereafter).    I grabbed my seat around 7-ish and was amazed.  I've been watching RAW all these years but had never seen the set in person.  My seat was 13 rows up from the floor, parallel to the announce table.  I was at the edge of the stage, and couldn't see the Titan-tron, but oh well, I was there.  The setup truly amazed me.  Anyway, Howie Finkel comes out and announces some dark matches, which involves jabronies getting a tryout shot.  Those matches were okay.  Then we got a couple Heat taped matches (Spike Dudley vs. Renee Dupree, and the Dudleys vs. Val Venis  Lance Storm).  Then we went live!    And before we knew what was going on, the glass shattered, and Stone Cold Steve Austin hit the ring to talk some smack!  Man, that was awesome!  Then Vince came out to yell at him, and it just went to (oh) Hell (yeah) from there.  I'm sitting in between a couple of guys who were 18 or 19 who had never seen a wrestling event in their lives.  I hadn't seen one since they were toddlers.  So we were all marking out.    Further on in the show, Rico came out to introduce Stacey Keibler and Miss Jackie when Kane's pyro hit out of nowhere.  Let me tell you.  From where I was sitting, those flames burn hot! (Not to mention scared the living shit out of me...).    Ditto when My Man, my Main man, Booker T. came out with his flames a'jumping.  That pyro burns 13 rows back.  I'm sitting parralell to King and J.R. and thinking about how they manage to endure it every week.    Anyway, it was an awesome show.  It ended with Mick Foley challenging Randy Orton, Dave Batitsta, and Ric Flair to a 3-on-2 match at WrestleMania.  All of us in attendance knew who it was going to be, but that still didn't stop the house from popping HUGE when The Rock came out sprinting and helping Mankind beat the crap out of Evolution.    (A side note...I was hovering a bit by the merchandise stands.  People were asking for Evolution T-Shirts left and right.)  So the live show ended with Rocky and Mick sending Evolution up the ramp.    Then we hear the glass shatter, and Stone Cold Steve Austin comes out to the ring.  He grabs a mic and says, "I'm sorry to ruin your moment, I know that you and Mick Foley are special friends..."  "WHOA WHOA WHOA!!," The Rock says, "EVERYBODY knows, The Rock likes that POONTANG PIE!" Then he continues, "But, um, speaking of the streudel...how you doing, Lillian?"  Referring to Lillian Garcia, the ring announcer.  Rock brings Lillian into the ring, and Stone Cold decides that everyone should sing a song.  Meanwhile, some drunk dumbfuck decides to jump the railing and gets jumped by security.  Security has to struggle like hell with this guy to get him back over the railing (no, it wasn't me..).  The Rock says, "Hey, don't be rough on the guy, he's wearing a Stone Cold T-Shirt!"  Stone Cold turns to Rock and Mick Foley with Lillian Garcia at his side and says, "Doesn't Lillian look lovely?  I almost proposed to her the other night."  Rock says, "Why didn't you?"  "Because I ran out of beer!"  At which point the beers started flying left and right into the ring.  Mostly for Steve, but Lillian was chugging them too.  At one point, Mick, Rock, and Austin had Lillian on her knees while they were all pouring beer down her throat and all over her body and elswhere... Then Austin got down on his knee in front of Lillian.  Rock was getting ready to leave the ring when Steve said, "No, Rock.  I want you to be here for this.  You're a good friend of mine."    "Lillian...Will you..."  "...get me another beer?"  Mick Foley went on to acknowledge the fact that he lived in the Atlanta suburbs during his WCW days and pointed out that Austin also lived in Marietta during his WCW days (the crowd popped for that, of course).   In the end, it was Austin with beers galore in his hand making his way up the ramp. On each end of the ramp, he's saluting the fans the only way he knows how, and smack his beers together.    Man, that was awesome.
