Everything on campus after 5:00 tonight was canceled because of an ice storm..  Everyone is going out tonight to have fun, get drunk and try to get young women to bear their breasts..  I would like to be a part of this debauchery but alas I am taking the safe road and staying in and studying even though there is a chance I might not have to take my test..  It will be an easy test and I wouldn't drink more than 2 or 3 beers but still would be fun to be out and about..  I am torn on wanting this test canceled and not wanting to have stayed in studying all night for nothing..  ohh well either way I will do well and get good grades which is the most important thing I guess..  The responsible Zeke is coming about ever so slowly..  well I'm going to hit the books again but I'm going to leave you with a quote from one of my favorite people ever, Jake Blues himself, John Belushi, "Don't Leave."  He said this to the girl he was with right before he died.  She left and the next day they found him dead in bed.  That was March 4th, 1982..  21 years ago.. so I want everyone to give a shout out to my man John today..  I miss him..
