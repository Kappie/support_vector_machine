Shouldn't had got the seafood box, the food was pretty undercooked. But I wasn't paying much attention much to the distraught of my stomach later on.  Wasn't feeling too well the rest of the day :/  Down and out but having a blast, perhaps not having a blast but still down and out.  Time to shutup now, even I'm scaring myself silly with purple and yellow goosebumps.
