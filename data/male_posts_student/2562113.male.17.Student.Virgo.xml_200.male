Why do we question life, the meaning and purpose of it? If we fully understand why we’re here does that mean we have an advantage over someone who doesn’t? Does answering these questions give us total power to control our lives and those lives around us? Maybe there is no answer. Maybe we do have a purpose. Maybe we’re just here because we are. Aren’t we just all made up on the same things? Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Hydrogen? We are drinking water that’s been recycled for millions of years. We are made up of the same compounds that have been around for as long as time. Ok so we’re made up of elements so what. But, WE ARE HUMAN. We do have a conscious brain, we think, therefore we are. We invent things and live on new technologies. We have emotions, we live and interact with other people. We are sociable. Let me just get down to it. I’m tired of people complaining about life. I love life. We have so much to live for, some of you people are just so caught up in your selfish little minds and raw emotions that it makes me sick.. The moping and complaining and sorrow has to stop! Yesterday someone went up to me and said something about a sick family member. Yes I was sympathetic for the kid but I’m tired of this kid complaining about stupid shit that happens in his life. I’m sorry that’s what happens in life… people come, people go, people are born, people die, you get sick, you get well, you eat, you sleep, you wake up from a good night of sleep, you wake up from no sleep, you get older everyday, you lose your innocence, you drink, you get drunk, you hookup with people , you vomit, you pass out, you get stomped on, you wake up with a hangover, you go to school, you get good grades, you make the top 20 or you don’t, you get bad grades, you fail, you achieve, you feel good, you feel bad, you feel accepted, you feel rejected, you feel like shit, you get excited, you get bored, you get tired, you get hungry, you eat, you feel fat, you workout, you get strong, you get buff, you shower, you shit, you piss, you shave, you get dirty all over again, you have sex, you wear a condom or you don’t, you bust, in her ass cunt mouth face hair tits wherever you want or wherever it ends up, you get a sex partner, you start a relationship, you cheat, she cheats, you break up, you get back together, she cheats some more, you break up again, you get your license, you drive, you crash, you cry, you get a job, you get money, you buy whatever you want, you save money, you spend it all, you buy clothes, your clothes wear out, your clothes suck, you get new clothes, you flirt, you hookup even more, you get led on, you get heartbroken, you laugh, you cry, you make friends, you lose friends, you go on vacations, you get tan, you lose your tan, you get robbed, you get arrested, you get punched in the face, you get your car vandalized, you slip, you fall, you do drugs, you crash, hard, you get addicted, you come off an addiction, you get addicted to something else, sex, you feel like shit, you live you learn, you love, you care, you question life, you question if this is all that it has to offer, you’re in college, you’re going to get a job soon, you’re going to fall in love, have lots of sex, have lots of kids, then what, go on vacation, buy an expensive car, get your dream house, be happy? Really happy? Get a divorce? Stay married, till death do us part?  ^ ^ THAT'S LIFE. Sure life for a lot of you sucks balls. You’re in Rockland. Do whatever it takes to get the fuck outta there! If you’re not in Rockland and life sucks ass. Stop doing drugs, they really make you depressed when you don’t have them. And if life still sucks for you go to a hospital and look at all the people who are dying. They are not all old people. And if that doesn’t work climb to the top of a mountain and enjoy the view. Nature calms me the fuck down and the thin air will give you a natural high. And if that doesn’t work masturbate until your genitals fall off. And if that doesn’t work read a book, watch a movie. Or go do some stupid random shit, like start a small riot in the mall. Go a little crazy. See how much you can get away with. Pretend you’re crazy. Drink and be merry. Stop complaining. Life kicks ass. I love every second of it. When some shit happens to me I don’t give a fuck. This is what I live for. This is why I am alive. I have it better off than a billion other poor ass mother fucking 19 year olds. And so do you.  I’m done mouthing off. If you’re offended in any way you can suck my balls. I will enjoy it.  Have a super smutty day!  - R w L super SMUT
