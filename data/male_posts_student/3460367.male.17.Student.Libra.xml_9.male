       
      Well it's been awhile since I posted.  Part of it is cause I have been busy, too tired, oh yeah I broke my arm too... that might have something to do with it.  Lets see Saturday I broke it playing paintball.  I broke it while I was capturing the flag, I tripped on the way back and heard it pop.  But I did pick the flag back up and kept running to score.  I walked back holding my wrist, it hurt a little everyone said I was white like a sheet.  So I went to the ER.  I got to sit around for 3 hours while they got around to fixing me.  They decided just to splint my arm instead of setting it.  So I went home and went to church on Sunday.  I wasn't in that much pain which was good.  Monday I went to see the doctor.  He said he would need to sedate me to set it.  Tuesday morning I went in to the hospital to be knocked out and set.  That went well I woke up from my drugs by a wonderful nurse... not.  I recovered for a bit then I got dressed and went home.  I ate 2 subs for lunch.  Then I just hung out.  They put a giant cast on so I can't move my elbow.  It's a real pain.  Wednesday I wasn't allowed to drive till noon.  So I got to Bobi's around 12:30 or so.  I finished up some work for her and headed home around 5.  Thursday was a fun day.  I got up and over to Bobi's a little late cause I took a bath.  I organized all the tent markers and walked through the park to get an idea of where everything is.  Then I went to the mall.  I got a card for Lisa and her present, a card for my dad, and some batteries for my new mouse I've ordered.  Then home and dinner.  Then I got online, big mistake.  I talked to Lisa for awhile then she brought something up.  Then she wouldn't talk about it.  See below:    20:57:14 livingoutloud777: *hears Lisa mutter something about how much of a pain Guys are* 20:57:40 lisxc7234: its true. 20:57:48 lisxc7234: although i thought last night and it actually scared me. 20:57:50 lisxc7234: haha 20:58:08 livingoutloud777: You thought?

Just keep it in mind for later 21:11:22 lisxc7234: well its not that i dont trust you.. but i just thought how i wanted to have bf, but then realized what happened bewteen me and the joe at my school and how busy i was.. thats all its nothing important if that makes you feel anybetter, but sometimes i girl just wants a bf, to be able to comfort and cuddle with ehr thats all and i was in one of those moods last night 21:11:29 lisxc7234: im sorry i said anything to begin with 21:12:57 lisxc7234: i have to go ill ttyl lylab bye Lisa disconnected (21:13:01)   So I sent her an email that night.  Lisa,  	I didn't get to say what I wanted to before you got off.  You need to understand this.  I don't care what you do when it comes to a boyfriend.  I mean I care about how you are doing and how it is going but I don't care if you date etc.  And I know what you mean about wanting someone to comfort you etc.  So you don't need to apologize for feeling that way.  I want only to be a friend.  I would like to know what is going on in your life and talk to you about the guys in your life the way I do with Jillian or Jen or my cousin.  I mean if you don't want me to that is fine I am pretty good at ignoring things.  I just don't want you thinking I'm jealous or whatever, I'm really not.  It might be hard to believe or whatever but it is true.  And I really hope you don't think of me as an ex (or etc), cause that isn't how I think of you.  You are a good friend Lisa and I don't want something like this to change it.  I hope you have a good day tomorrow (probably today when you read this) and maybe I'll talk to you on the weekend.  Jeremy   Friday was fun, I didn't do much of anything at Bobi's.  I got online that night IMed Lisa and she just ignored me.  That was cool.  One more reason to be ticked.  Saturday we had this convo:   12:31:41 livingoutloud777: (Ignore me if you want and I'll get the hint :-P but since you don't have an away message up)   Hey 12:31:48 lisxc7234: hey 12:33:10 lisxc7234: I didnt once think you were going to get jealous i was hoping that you werent, but i didnt think it would bug you, i just like to keep somethings to myself. 12:34:40 livingoutloud777: Okay I understand that I just didn't know what you thought, then when you ignored me yesterday... :-P  IDK You sure have interesting ways of communicating :-P 12:36:10 lisxc7234: Well yesterday i was mad because my mother has really started to be getting at me, and its really making me mad. And idk i just thought that you didnt need toknow but you keep nagging at it.. and it made me mad.. because  most of the time im an independent person 12:37:52 livingoutloud777: Didn't need to know you and your mom were having troubles?  And how do I nag? :-P  I thought only females could do that JK!!  I really want to know why you feel I nag because if I can change it I will.  You just have to tell me :-P  I failed mind reading class 12:39:28 lisxc7234: yeah well i didnt, idk you just kept bugging me about it, and i dont like to be bugged about something it really makes me p.oed and my brother was like oh your 3 mintues over so i had no chance to see what you had said because he was standing over my shoulder and watching what i was typing 12:42:13 livingoutloud777: Okay so I think you are finally making some sense :-P  Just cause you bring it up doesn't mean you want to talk about it and I shouldn't talk about it unless you do? 12:42:42 lisxc7234: yes! 12:42:45 lisxc7234: lol:-P 12:43:22 livingoutloud777: *shakes head* Then what is the point in bringing it up in the first place? 12:43:33 lisxc7234: Because you wanted to know! 12:44:43 lisxc7234: anyways how are you? 12:45:08 livingoutloud777: Look I don't want to argue all these little points but you need a memory refresher 12:45:12 livingoutloud777: 20:52:09 lisxc7234: lol thats good, hows the house? any better? 20:52:33 livingoutloud777: Yeah it is quieter, but still kinda tense 20:53:36 livingoutloud777: How's your life?

I asked because you mentioned it in the first place.  It isn't like I came out of the blue and asked.  But really how am I to know what you want to talk about and what you don't? 12:48:17 lisxc7234: wait, i was tlaking about the boy stuff, 12:48:22 lisxc7234: i dont mind explaining that stuff 12:49:44 livingoutloud777: 12:36:10 lisxc7234: Well yesterday i was mad because my mother has really started to be getting at me, and its really making me mad.

I really do care for you.  I'll admit I was pretty upset yesterday and last night.  I told myself I really didn't care anymore that losing you as a friend would be okay.  I was angry with you for several reasons.  So yeah I don't really enjoy this next part but I'm going to tell you what they are and you might feel I am attacking you but I'm not.  I've just kept on ignoring them for too long and I finally lost it.  But I do care and I'm not attacking you. 14:37:58 lisxc7234: ok 14:46:51 livingoutloud777: IDK I guess the biggest thing is how sometimes you refuse to accept responsibility for your actions.  Like you kept on saying how I was "nagging" you, but you wouldn't admit that you are the one who brought it up.  People have brought it up to me before, and I kinda saw where they were coming from but I didn't think it mattered enough then. 14:47:20 lisxc7234: like who else? 14:47:41 lisxc7234: cuz i know i brought it up, but if ibring something up doesnt nessary mean i want to tlak about it. 14:48:15 livingoutloud777: Yeah but you wouldn't just accept the fact that you brought it up. 14:48:36 lisxc7234: no i knew i brought it up 14:49:58 livingoutloud777: Well you wouldn't admit that yesterday 14:50:07 lisxc7234: but iknew that. 14:50:25 lisxc7234: okay thats settled.. but what else? 14:50:31 livingoutloud777: Well that leads me to the second thing which annoys me 14:54:55 lisxc7234: i warn you, if i say somethings i dont mean it, jeff gordons engine blew up:'( 14:59:48 livingoutloud777: I don't think I've ever gotten a real apology from you for anything.  If you can honestly tell me you don't think you've ever done/said something where you could have apologized then IDK.  You said that Steph treats you worse than all the rest of your friends, well lately I feel that the same goes for you.  I don't know how to explain it. 15:01:00 lisxc7234: okay, 15:01:08 lisxc7234: Well i can understand that, somewhat.  15:02:49 lisxc7234: Like i now i have changed from the end of the year. And idk i havent been able to go to yg, so it has like made me feel that i havent been there for you guys, but it also feels like i shouldnt because i cant make it, so idk it feels like i dont belong there sometimes. idk its just something i have picked up, sometimes it seems you have more fun without me. And there for idk i set myself up for somethings. 15:04:18 livingoutloud777: I'm not talking about that. 15:04:25 lisxc7234: okay. 15:05:01 livingoutloud777: I'm talking about how I get treated by others and how I get treated by you 15:05:14 lisxc7234: ok. 15:05:23 lisxc7234: so basically your saying that im not a good friend 15:06:41 livingoutloud777: I'm saying something has changed.  You were before we started dating.  Then things changed.  You definitely aren't the same person I met a year ago 15:06:53 lisxc7234: ok? 15:07:32 lisxc7234: so i have changed. 15:07:39 lisxc7234: i dont think im the only one who has. 15:07:45 lisxc7234: (not you( 15:10:54 livingoutloud777: But yes you had me pretty ticked.  If I get yelled at for asking questions about things you bring up and then I am expected to apologize I get pretty mad 15:11:07 lisxc7234: im sorry then 15:16:08 livingoutloud777: If you don't want to talk about something don't bring it up and don't stop me when we are at the end of a conversation to tell me you don't want to talk about it.  I've been dreading talking to you because there is never anything on your mind and when I ask about things I get yelled at 15:18:05 lisxc7234: Ok, first, when i tell you that i dont want to talk about something that usually means its on my mind. And just because i say that doesnt mean that i dont want to talk, but you seem like the same way, nothing is ever on your mind anymore either  15:19:06 lisxc7234: so basically im getting in trouble for telling you whats on my mind, when you want toknow, but then also because i dont want to talk about it. 15:22:18 livingoutloud777: Fine I won't ask, you can tell me what is.  You can initiate the ims, and you can carry the conversation.  I don't want to be accused of prying 15:22:41 lisxc7234: No, i dont want that i was just saying.  15:23:18 lisxc7234: Because it seems like im doing all the wrong so idk, see this is why i dont want to go to L.A. because im sure everyone else feels that way 15:23:34 lisxc7234: and it seems something has bugged you ever since i couldnt go to yg. 15:24:33 livingoutloud777: Well aside from the fact IDK if I could pick you out in a crowd or that I don't really think I know you nothing is bugging me 15:26:02 lisxc7234: Well, that wasnt my fault i wanted to go, my dad said that i have to rest. I Swear because i loved going to yg and seeing you guys, but you know what if everyone hates me then why bother? Why bother going to lake ann, and why just bother doing anything? Lisa went away (15:26:44) Away Message: "brb" (15:26:44) 15:26:54 livingoutloud777: IDK where you are getting where everyone hates you 15:26:58 lisxc7234: brb 15:27:11 livingoutloud777: If I hated you I wouldn't be talking to you right now 15:28:55 livingoutloud777: I care Lisa and so does everyone else Lisa came back (15:29:23) 15:29:34 livingoutloud777: If you don't want to go to Lake Ann I can't do anything aside from tell you that I would miss you 15:30:31 lisxc7234: well i want to, but idk. From what im getting at jen thinks im trying to steal kevin from her, umm thats just one. 15:30:50 lisxc7234: idk. what else is bugging you then? 15:31:22 livingoutloud777: I think I'm done for now 15:31:27 livingoutloud777: Oh wait :-P 15:36:31 livingoutloud777: IDK one of the big things is that I don't feel you trust me as much as you used to.  I mean yeah I can understand that and all but that is still something I feel.  You know more about me than pretty much anyone, I trust you with just about anything.  Yeah now I'm done 15:36:51 lisxc7234: Geeze im amazed im not dead 15:37:12 lisxc7234: Its not that i dont trust you, i think my biggest fear is hurting you if i "date" someone else, and i dont want that to happen. 15:38:51 livingoutloud777: Lisa i'm not at all worried about you dating someone else.  I half expected you'd be weeding thru applications by now.  Don't take this the wrong way but you're a flirt :-P 15:40:53 lisxc7234: No i know, but not as bad as some people. and i only really flirt with guys im interested in   All in all... I'm still not happy with her.  I really hope she is grabbed by God at Lake Ann and is shook really hard.  I really don't think I like her any more, in pretty much all senses of the word.
