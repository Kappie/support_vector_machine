I could have seen pretty much any movie, including those rated R in the US, like 21 Grams (or, as it is known here, vingt-et-un grammes).  They don't butter their popcorn here, they   sugar   it.  I ordered mine without sugar, but it was still pretty sweet (sweet as in sugary, not like rad).  They gave me my coke in a bottle instead of an icy cup.  In the theater, the seats were all like car seats, all padding with automotive-type armrests and no cupholders (but then again, no cups).  The movie was in English with French subtitles.  I did my best not to look down at the subtitles.  Arnaud said that he didn't either, but there was an awful lot of idiomatic expressions that I wouldn't have understood had I been him.  That's it, except that Arnaud taught me a new card game.  Here, they call the game War "Bataille" (battle), and then there's this variation called "Bataille en Corse" (Corse = Corsica).  Here's how it goes: The object of the game is to get all the cards.  Each person gets half the deck, and then they take turns putting cards down in the middle; it doesn't matter if they're higher or lower.  If someone puts down a Jack, a Queen, a King, or an Ace, the other person has a certain number of chances to put down a Jack, a Queen, a King, or an Ace (one for Jack, two for Queen, three for King, and four for Ace), and then the other person has to do the same if the person puts down one of those four cards in response.  If all one's chances are used up without having put down one of those four cards, the other person takes all the cards in the middle and starts again.  If two of the same kind of card are put down in succession (e.g., if someone puts down a three and then the other person puts down another three), the first person to slap the cards gets the cards.  If at the end of the game, someone has lost all his cards, then they select one card at random from the other person's deck and keep playing; if the regular taking turns thing continues, then they can keep taking cards from the other's deck, but if they lose their cards again, they've lost.  If more than two people are playing, a loser can reenter the game by slapping the deck if there's a pair.  And that's how the game is played.
