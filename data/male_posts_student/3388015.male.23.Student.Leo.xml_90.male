Nor did we want to see it all.  I'm not really impressed by large zoos any more than I am impressed by large amusement parks.  Size doesn't matter, right folks?  Anyway, once we walked the zoo, rode the bus tour, rode the sky ferry and drank our 15th free refill on our $8 soda souvenir cup, we decided to leave and get to our hotel by 8.   urlLink    Family Entering Zoo   urlLink    Mom  I, with Aaron smiling behind us   urlLink    My Favorite Animal  We stayed at a place called King's Inn in Hotel Circle.  It had a pool (good) and a hot tub (the real reason we stayed there) and the rate was great.  We got there, checked in, put down our stuff, immediately changed and all got into the hot tub.  After 30 minutes, we only left to eat pizza and wings for dinner.  It was 10pm, we were exhausted, and all went to bed.
