Rising and falling, a natural cycle it has become. All my life, a still pendulum I have been. Until the day, when her real self, I have seen. Till the time, when my pendulum she pushed. Up and up I went, but the ecstacy lasted until then.  Please do not ignore me, please do not deplore me. For if my words, a smile it gives you, Contentment would I feel, lest it is all a ruse. For jealousy grips me heart and cynicism suffocates me. Your breath i could not feel, you scent, my nose, it could not reach.  How I wish to have a heart-felt conversation with you. Your patient confidante, i would gladly be. Far beyond the surface, our understanding I wish to reach. But how could I? When my feelings I refuse to ditch? For if supression is my sacrifice, I would gladly do it, with all of my heart  This pendulum, I don't want to be,  This endless cycle do I want to be free. Please push this pendulum again,  and hold it there once the top,it reaches For only you can release me from this pain, only you.......
