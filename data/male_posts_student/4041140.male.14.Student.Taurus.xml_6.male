As testament to the outstanding level of new talent to emerge from the Dare competition, CMPi, organizers of the ECTS event, has decided to award the three winning teams a stand at the show, which is attended by the world's biggest games developers and publishers on the look out for the stars of tomorrow. The Dare to be Digital competition - which is the only one of its kind in the UK - is made up seven teams from across Scotland and Ireland.  The students are fighting it out until the end of August at the University of Abertay Dundee, which runs the competition in partnership with Scottish Enterprise Tayside and Dundee City Council. Now in its 16th year, ECTS - which is firmly established as the place in Europe where the entire interactive entertainment industry comes together for three days to do business - will run alongside the Games Developers Conference Europe (GDCE), at the Earls Court Conference Centre from August 31st to September 3rd 2004. GDCE is the official Europe trade event "by game developers for developers" of computer,  console , mobile, arcade,  online games , and location based entertainment. It's the forum where European programmers, artists, producers, game designers,  audio  professionals and others involved in the development of interactive games gather to exchange ideas, network, and shape the future of the industry. Andy Lane, Games Portfolio Director, CMPi comments: "Dare to be Digital is the perfect showcase for the most talented developers of tomorrow and GDC Europe is all about the cutting edge creativity which makes this industry so exciting. CMPI is delighted to support the development community in this way - we look forward to welcoming the winners to Earls Court in September and making this a regular fixture." As part of their prize, CMP are also providing the Dare winners with free access to GDCE. This will allow the students the opportunity to mix with many of the industry's leading figures, and the chance to attend lectures, tutorials, panels and roundtables, addressing serious issues facing the sector and providing essential information across the technical, artistic, and business aspects of game development. The Dare teams have been asked to submit a concept for a new and original computer game or educational entertainment product. Those with the most creative ideas and greatest market potential made it through and will have to present a finished digital prototype and business sales document which can be pitched to investors, at the end of the ten week period. Dare is open to students across Scotland, and due to the rising profile of Dare, this year students from Ireland have come on board, with a team from DCU and Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design  Technology, which made it through the Irish heat, co-ordinated by The Digital Hub in Dublin. The winners will be announced on the 26th August, at an award ceremony in Dundee, where teams will compete for a prize fund of £5000 as well as follow up-support to develop their prototype to commercial reality. There will also be an additional prize of £1000 for the best 'team working' group. Due to the high level of excellence generated by the competition over the last three years, two new sponsors have come on board for 2004,  Microsoft  and the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts, NESTA, joining BBC Scotland Interactive and NCR.    Go Ireland!
