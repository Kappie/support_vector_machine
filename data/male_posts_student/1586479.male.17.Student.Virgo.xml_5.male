Yes, that's how 'tonight' is spelled.  I just 'suspended myself' from wrestling, hopefully for the rest of the season. I have spent over 17 years on this planet and I finally realized something; I hate organized sports. I hate them. I love a pick-up game of football or hacky-sack or something, but all these sports are way too damn competitive! I understand it's some people's thing, but it's not mine. I'm not good at any sports, I think most of them are barbaric, and I think they have lost sight of their true origins: they started off as games. GAMES!! Aren't games supposed to be, ya know, enjoyable?! I supposed my view isn't very widely spread since our school is totally sports oriented (academics? arts? what are those?). I just hate the sports credits that are required at school. It takes so much time away from important things like family and homework. I don't regret stopping wrestling; I just joined it to see if I like it or not.  ahh....that feels better.  And now, with the all the extra time I have I can actually get a hold on all my work that was due a long time ago and maybe even start reading a book or two I've been meaning to.  Blogs ARE very therapeutic. wow.  So, I must go get foodstuffs now.  hasta lavista, baby
