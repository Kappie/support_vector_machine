It's an open source comic book character, meaning that anyone can use the character for any reason without worrying about copyrights or whatever. Her superpower is that she can exist in all dimensions at once, thus cleverly avoiding continuity issues when she goes on adventures that are mutually exclusive. Check out Jenny  urlLink  here .
