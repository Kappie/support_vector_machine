MINDY has MORPHED INTO   MUGGER/PROFESSOR LEOW  ! oh the HORROR man. the slacker/non-muggerish/don'tdohomework mindy has CHANGED. oh no where have they taken my favourite old mindy to? for example, during physics tutorial this insane woman started answering all of miss ong's questions and even offering to go to the whiteboard and write down her answers! NOT GOOD. however this did keep me and elsa in constant hysterics with her stupid antics la. so it's good for our abs. heh    next silly thing is my discovery that i have... *DRUMROLL*        BIONIC EARS!           woohoo cool me. right so during chemistry lecture today, i was seating one row behind nana and bestestest friend. well i was technically like 5 - 6 seats away from them in the row behind. so suddenly i hear 'amanda blahblahblah' then i am like 'eh who called me?' apparently it was nana BACKSTABBING (just kidding)me!! nana HOW could you betray me? hahha my ears are so sharp man! then during physics tutorial i was seating at the second row left corner and ke ai was at the last row right corner when i heard her say 'amanda blahblahblah' and AGAIN i heard it and turned around saying 'hey what did u say about me?' HAHAH i have such sharp ears man! all you people gossiping and talking rubbish about me better not do it within a 10 metre radius of me because MY EARS ARE LISTENING! x)
