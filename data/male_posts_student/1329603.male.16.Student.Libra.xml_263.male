The answer lies in the fact that I'm sitting here posting, I think... I am going to crash and burn in this exam (despite this being the science I'm good at) and I don't really care. Really bad attitude, I know, but still... this is one of the subjects that I'm not going to keep doing (as with all the sciences) so as long as I pull a B I'm fine.  Got an email from Rhi today - weee! That cheered me up immensly, because it was a welcome break from shiteing myself because of the impending doom of the dreaded Chemistry exam. Oh, and I got my developed film in town just before I came in, and it's utter bollocks, really. There are like 10 actual properly developed photos, and then the rest just... well, aren't there. Shall have to look at the CD to see if any of the others work. Got a good pic of Scott but that's about it.  I leave you with news that, somewhere in Liverpool, a young boy from Bermuda is having a large amount of success in terms of his relationship with the female version of me. I wish them both the best of luck, that is unless I go to Liverpool, where I expect them to break up immediately and let me go out with Pip, the woman ^_^.  Quote of the day: "Still, they lead me back, To the long winding road. Don't leave me waiting here, Lead me to your door."  From The Beatles'   The Long and Winding Road   Love, Jon Roskilly
