Written completely in C# or whatever language supported by the runtime's compilers. How long would it take? How long just to make a functioning GNU-like environment (bash clone, etc..). Should we strive for GNU-like environment, POSIX standards, OpenGL etc...? And how about the graphic environment, hardware acceleration, 3D and the works. How can drivers be programmed in a high-level language like C#? Can a well written kernel core help in this task? I don't have answers to any of these question, if anyone reads my blog, please mail me just to have some feedback. Write to schrepfler AT inwind [dot] it.
