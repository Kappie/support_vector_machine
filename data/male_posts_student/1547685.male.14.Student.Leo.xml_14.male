Well i think ill start off with CM.........it was really nerve racking going in and when i looked at the test, it was a lot harder then last years test (the one i studied off of). So for now ill sit and wait for the results and practice the rest of my pieces for my second half of CM.       This week was spirit week for the jr. high. We had to dress up everyday and then do a skit on Thursday(today). Right now im really hateing my homeroom because we're so unorganized and no one really gives a care about anything we do. Last year was the best in mr. merrells class b/c we won in like 3 ralleys. All i got to say is "theres nothing like the past." All my classes have been fine and for once im actually getting an A in english........ The sharks play today against LA and i guess ill just sit here and work on my Celebrity Christian report on Rick Quan. This is kevin blogging out.........
