I only do this for purposes of my own... Just for self-pity again. So that I can expose some things to take revenge. Yes, I am pitiful. No, I don't really want to hurt people, but yes I have gotten run over by an aircraft carrier which, by the way... It brings the thought to mind that I got those oranges stuck in the vacuum cleaner after it exploded. IT'S NOT MY FAULT, I SWEAR!!!(I wrote sweat the first time before correcting it...)  I'm saving for a portable dvd player. Which I want very badly, after experiencing one on my trip to Washington, DC. The one I want is over $300 and it's reviewed as the "best one out there". I have almost half the money, and despite me beggin my mom for jobs and money, I haven't gotten income in the last week and a half. I want one by the end of May, which is when we might travel to Kentucky.   I'm usually on a chatster server(IRC) and reside in the channel #Middle-Earth most of the time. So if you ever want to experience true boredom, chat with me.              *Personals* 13 year old desperate for something to do         Saving for DVD player         Doesn't want friends         Just money, lol.
