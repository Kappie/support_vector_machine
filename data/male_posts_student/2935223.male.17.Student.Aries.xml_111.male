IT RULES!  I FEEL LIKE A BILLION BUCKS WHEN I PUT IT ON! minus bein' paper and green and havin' a bunch of dead presidents all over me. ew... and I got new kick-ass shoes, and a belt, and.....wow.  I sure do sound like a girl....shoot me.  Shoot me now. Then we went and ate at The Old Spaghetti Factory, which is an uber rock-awesome italian restaurant*DUH!* Then my Mom, Rick, and I went and saw The Village, which was a pretty good movie.  Kinda predictable though....and I don't think it has much re-view value, so...I'm gonna leave it at that. Then we came home and I'm sitting here watching Elimidate: Fabulous Over Fifty All I can say.......EW!  OH MY GOD I WANNA RIP MY EYES OUT!!!  D'ya know how wrong it is to see two fifty year olds doin' body shots?!?!?!  sick-o! hm......oh ya.  I've totally forgotten to talk about  THE DUNGEON .  It is the nickname for the room that I sleep in...in the basement of this house.  Plus, this house feels like a hobbit-hole, everything is like 4 feet tall.  I have to duck under almost every door, and a few ceilings. Everyone is havin' fun in RF...that's good.  Fun is good.  Tomorrow we're gonna go hikin' in the mountains and hang out with this really awesome missionary guy who returned from his mission: commonly referred to as RM's.  After seeing The RM...I'm not sure if I really look forward to that too much.(The RM is an LDS movie.)  Now that I'm watchin' The Drew Carey show, I totally forgot what I was gonna say....oh well.   Better for you guys anyway huh?  Peace! Spense
