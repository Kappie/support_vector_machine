One suggestion with the page tho'.   Put somethin' other than black folks on it. Too much of any one color, no matter what color it is, is no good  . Peace."  What can this dude be thinking?.....Did I say that my webpage was the official race relations website of the USA?....I have pictures of me and my peoples....at the time I didn't have any white, asian, or hispanic peoples....boy oh boy....  Anyway if I want to surround myself with black people till the sun absorbs the Earth that is my choice....I have some white and asian friends, but that doesn't mean I have to post their pictures on my personal web space....  ughhh...anyway back to the mundane....
