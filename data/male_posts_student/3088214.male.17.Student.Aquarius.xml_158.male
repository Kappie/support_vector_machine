I hate how our generation is made out to be irresponsible and wild, but I just wish that some of the older generations wouldn't classify all of us, because not everyone is lazy and crazy! I guess that I hope that I won't stereotype teenagers when I am old and rusty. Plus I think that with the knowledge that is available and the born genius' who are at Skyview, the future will be a better place than it is today!
