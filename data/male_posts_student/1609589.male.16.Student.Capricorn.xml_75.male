I'm excited about this because we haven't had a *good* lockin since OWL, and it's also the first time I take the (finished)drumbone anywhere.  Also, on sunday, we're talking about rhythms and stoof, and they wanted me to bring drumbone, so i'm not doing it just cuz i want to. It probably wouldn't be finished right now if i weren't bringing it.  I'm debating with myself over whether to bring the dulcimer, but i probably will end up not bringing it, unless everybody says "Jesse! Bring the dulcimer-of-happiness!" Then I'll talk to the all-around master of the dulcimer, my mom, and she'll probably say yes. I should get it tuned first. Or... find a way to tune it myself... what an amazing thought.
