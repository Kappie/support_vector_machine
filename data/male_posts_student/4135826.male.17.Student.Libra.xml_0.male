You hide behind a mask of anonymity, giving you the power to say practically anything you want to without fear of reprocussion, just because I don't know who you are. From the looks of it, you don't know who I am either. And that's where your weakness lies.  Now, you comment on my blog with insults and derisions, attempting to accomplish what? What you're doing is the equivalent of a bully poking a blind kid with a stick. If this is your idea of feeding your ego, then you have a sick mind. Secondly, the fact that you actually have the time to read a stranger's posts and make false assumptions on a very regular basis - hell, everything you've said is wrong - proves that you've got a low self-esteem that can only be fueled by pointing out the weaknesses in people and attacking them.  It takes a blind man to see another person's faults.  You also comment and say that you're an NYU student, blah blah blah ... etc. Excuse, but where's your proof? I see no reason to believe any of your credentials. Oh, it could very well be true that you go to NYU, but if that's the case, then what are you doing caring about a high school student's life and deriding it (exactly like a 5th grader would throw rocks at the 2nd graders on the playground)? Your very actions prove that you aren't exactly of any high intelligence at all but rather have juvenile behavior.  Oh, I'm sorry, does NYU prevent you from being immature? Guess not.  Your insults about going up to Cooperstown just to fail are laughable, too. "if ur a minority, you'll fail cuz they are racist up there." Wow, man. I didn't know that it was still 1960. I better get my friends Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson to protect me! Strangely enough, they mimic the put-downs of grade-school bullies also. "You'll never do it!" "Why don't you quit now?" Were you by any chance a fan of the Rugrats when you were younger? I'll have to rename you Angelica.  And anyway, who would I be to listen to your insults? Even the greatest people had to deal with animosity all around them. Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed for it, and look at what he accomplished. I'm sure that if he can do a great thing when there was so much hatred around him, I'm strong enough to pass just this test with a childish anonymous insulter putting me down.  But enough about what my goals are, let's move back onto you. I don't for one second believe that you're an NYU student or that you passed in Centereach or anything like that. In fact, I believe you put that all there just to spite me. For one, NYU is a competitive school that requires a sense of maturity to enter it, as would be determined in an interview. However, from your display here, I don't have any reason to believe you are mature at all. Proof:  a. Attacking someone with insults through the internet anonymously b. Very improper grammar, reminiscent of the internet shorthand I only see used by teeny-boppers c. Apparent obsession with violence from your "I wish I was your father so I could beat your ass every day" comment. Wath Jerry Springer, much? d. Lack of given proof for credentials - you could very well be a 12-year-old that's just trying to say to his friends that he insulted a 17-year-old on the internet e. Making false assumptions with every word f. Taking everything I say literally  Look, Angelica. I started this blog for my personal enjoyment and to let my friends have a little look into my life through my eyes. I sometimes laugh at my parents, but I do it only because I have the utmost respect for them. I know they love me, and the feeling is mutual. You have no idea who I am, what my feelings are, and what things I've really been through. You have no right to come into my blog, insult me anonymously without the common courtesy of letting me know who you are, and deride my every feeling. Exploiting my shortcomings? Making fun of me when I fail? Just who do you think you are?  Your behavior is similar to being handed a loaded gun and firing into a dark room filled with people. Chew on that metaphor for a while. You'll probably understand it pretty well, being the mean-spirited violent person you appear to be.  From this point on, I'm not allowing comments on my blog, and to everyone that's been reading this, I apologize. This is to prevent such puerile commenters as this anonymous one from criticizing me unjustly.  One more thing, in regard to Angelica over here. Grow up. You may be an NYU student, but that doesn't mean you're not immature. You may be in the Trish School of the Arts, but that doesn't mean you have the right to act arrogantly in regard to people who have fallen short of reaching their goals. You may have had over a 1300 on your SAT, but that doesn't give you the right to put down anyone who strives for something better for themselves. You may think you know everything, but from what I've seen, you don't know shit.
