His most famous song, "Tip Toe Thru the Tulips with Me" was one of the top 40 hits of 1968. In 1968 and 1969, Tiny was a regular in the Johnny Carson show, on which he even got married. That wedding appearance on the "Tonight Show" marked Tiny's most popular moment, with 40 million viewers watching him tie the knot with 17-year-old Miss Vicki (Victoria May Budinger) on the night of December 17, 1969. Several concerts, tours, and television appearances followed the wedding broadcast. The couple had one daughter, Tulip, and was later divorced. "  Now what more can you say about a man who has lived such a full and amazing life? A legend of music. An idol to some. Why, he could be one of the greatest minds of MY generation!  Maybe he...         Um, ok.        (I really don't have anything against him, I just think this is a really unflattering picture and someone should get revenge on the photographer)
