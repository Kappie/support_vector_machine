Well we had contra dancing that night despite the absence of the Mosses, Heather and Danielle. So we had a great time, the guys weren't too outnumbered. Afterwards we came back to the house I got to play the Sanchez's in some connect four, ha ha that was fun. First I played misses Sanchez (and won) then I played Sarah a couple of times, I beat her a couple of times but she got me once. Ha ha then I played Elizabeth... the first game I set it up so that at the end she couldn't make a move without me winning so she was like "I want a rematch!". We played a bunch of games both winning and losing it was so much fun.  The Sanchez's and Jen ended up sleeping over so they could come to church with us the next day. We had a nice service and all with some great conversations afterwards. The Break dancing cups! woo hoo! ha ha, oh boy. So let's see this week: Well Monday I pretty much killed myself. I dont know how but I hurt my neck so bad I had to lay on the heating pad the whole day! I couldn't move my head at all, it was awful. The next day it was a little better but I still had to spend the majority of the day laying down. Well that night Gael and I rented Signs. Heard it was a good movie Sunday. Yikes! Near the end I was wondering how it could have a good ending? But it was all good in the end. Needless to say I jumped a couple of times. Wednesday not much out of the ordinary happened. Oh yeah by the way my dad had to leave for Mississippi Tuesday because his aunt died. So yeah that was kinda weird him leaving real quick. He got back late last night. So now it's today and were trying to get friends to go see a movie Saturday but I'm not sure how that will turn out. Oh yeah before I go... I have discovered the origin of the infamous "woot woot!" I had a dream and in it I was watching Star Wars: A new hope, and when Obi- wan sees the death star and says "that's no moon." Han solo goes "woot woot!" And I was like "whoa! so thats where we got it from". so yeah anyways I gotta go. I'll post within the next month or so, ha ha. L8r
