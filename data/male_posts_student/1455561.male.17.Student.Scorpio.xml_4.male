Despite the fact that this would ruin all smaller clubs who would see gate sales drop, reducing their already precarious finances.  3) alex ferguson using the media to try to win games by undermining the opposition.  4) The glory hunting fans from oxford, bath and singapore who support the club for no other reason than cos they know they will win i.e. my friend supports united cos his mum does, she supports it cos she fancied george best.  Therefore he supports them for no other reason than george best’s thighs  5) Being the first club to go PLC and so being the club that changed football from a sport to hard cash.  So liverpool get money to improve the club and become great, united get money to please the shareholders, improving the squad and being entertaining are second to this  6) Due to the top 5 points they will be responsible for the demise of football.  7) Due to the demise of football, the popularity of rugby will rise  8) Rupert murdoch owns a considerable amount of their club.  Murdoch also drove football towards becoming business by creating the premiership, forcing people to pay £40 a month to see a few football games.  Murdoch also owns The Sun newspaper, responsible for getting the case against the policemen who caused the hillsborough disaster destroyed by writing about all the evidence just to make money.  The policemen where therefore allowed to go free.  9) Alex ferguson owns a horse. What does he do with the horse? Why does he (ferguson) drink so much whiskey?  Does the horse approve of the whiskey? If the horse loses a race, will it get a horseshoe kicked at it with breathtaking force?  Will the horse be going to madrid?  10) Childish arguments of united supporters i.e. owen is no good for england
