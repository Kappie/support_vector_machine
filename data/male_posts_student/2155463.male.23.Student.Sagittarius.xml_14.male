I mean, I've been on Earthlink since I got cable last year, so this is totally insane...all I can figure is that I was automatically set up with the screen name and all when I bought my Dell.  So now I'm stuck paying for a service I've never used...either that or going through the whole contestation ring-around.  Grr....
