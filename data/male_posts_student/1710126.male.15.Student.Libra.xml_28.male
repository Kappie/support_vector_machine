Iep learnt how to balance walk and sorta glide, but dun dare to go too fast coz cannot control...keep on going backwards then muz like fall down to regain balance...had a rather dramatic fall, but onli fell bout 4 times liddat so not too bad...very fun actually...hope i can do it properly tomolo...louis came to bug us saying he can skate ready liaoz, and were like running around and we coundnt chase him in our blades...oh wellz. He said i look kewl in the gear hahaz  then after tt went back to class to play sumemore, zhaoyu joined us, waiting for louis, then never turn up so we go big macs first, ordered then louis called pissed, we told him to join us there. After we juz started eating he arrived, then started playing cards, but got chased out by some cleaning lady, whu said tt "everytime  u RI guys come here and play one u knoe, and everytime i told them off" budden the manager came and told her not to bug us...hahahaz.   Taught louis bridge, he learn damn fast. then we went to coffee bean to continue playing like siao, ordered three drinks altogether got a treat from Zhaoyu/Dezhi and we drank like 8 cups of plain water in all, hahaz drained their flask... we sorta got burnt by the sun coz we purposely sat out in the sun, i insisted...all of us started bitching about Princess Nadias and Sophias and Yehenaras and Liao Qifangs, and leaves and CIP and going clubbing and womans bez frenz...if u play bridge u would knoe we r blatantly hinting at what to play hahaz...lotsa jokes there  Then we noticed this pervert staring at us...been there quite a long time grimacing and laughing and looking...then louis after a while shouted in the opp direction "quit staring at us, its rude!" Dezhi asked him not to. And the man juz grinned and read his newspaper, like 40-50 looks terrible...paedophile hahaz. Then later me n louis went over to look and he was like doing maths sums...RITE. At about 520 he went into coffee bean(we were sitting outside) to get something and we made a rum for it...he was following us to the MRT station...Zhaoyu suppose to take bus but followed us in, and we went home...  on the way home so tired changed to bus, fell asleep as usual and nearly missed my stop...came home and learnt thousand miles on the piano...i seem to b getting betta at playing on first sight...I hope so...
