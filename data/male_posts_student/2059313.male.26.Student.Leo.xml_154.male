She played the lead female role,  urlLink Louisa .  Now, I've known  urlLink Stephanie Seales   for almost four years, and I have always known she was extremely talented (even when she doubted herself), but I was really blown away by her performance.  The whole package was there.  Her acting was amazing and precise and flowing and natural.  Her voice was strong and yet portrayed fragility.  And, let's not forget that she was  HOT !  An actress that can sing, act, and has such beauty is a force to be reckoned with.  More than this, I cannot say.  I don't have the words to express it.  I don't think they exist.  I'm sorry to say that it's only running for two more days.  More people needed to see this show, and I would've definitely liked to see it again.  I can't help but be incredibly proud of my friend.
