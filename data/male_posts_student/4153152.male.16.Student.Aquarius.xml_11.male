I don't know, but many of you have probably heard about Novalogic's new game, Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising. I downloaded the demo from Fileplanet (Yes, I subscribe) and here are my impressions:  When I got the Joint Ops demo, I was pretty excited about it. While I was downloading, I read a couple previews of the game, and it sounded good:      "With our tour of the game out of the way, we finally got to get in some multiplayer action on two maps we hadn't seen before - "Pulau Raya Volcana" and "Padang River Basin." Both maps were played in Advance and Secure mode, with the second having an accelerated time-of-day setting - we could see the sun moving through the sky and shadows shifting around the map after just a few minutes." -GameSpy   and   "Even though they take place outdoors, Joint Operations' close-quarters battles seem to have the same pacing you might expect from a traditional tactical game--slowly creeping toward a goal with your teammates on overwatch, punctuated by quick firefights that are better fought with a low-power silenced weapon, like a silenced MP5 submachine gun. However, its vehicular battles are extremely varied--we saw plenty of different battle scenarios, including air-to-sea battles between Little Birds with gunners hanging off the side shooting their infantry weapons at Zodiacs piloted by engineers with antiair rocket launchers, ground assaults using armored vehicles with air support, and many others." -GameSpot   So, obviously, I was pretty anxious to get going with this game. After installation, I logged onto NovaWorld and looked for a server. Seeing games that supported 100 people was pretty impressive, seeing them full was more so. I chose a 53/64 game, and commenced loading.  The first thing I have to say is that the loading time is unexpectedly quick for as large and as detailed as this map is. [+10 points] The next thing I noticed was that the game had MANY ways to get where you were going, and they were all pretty entertaining. I hopped on a little bird piloted by Marine003 and he dropped me at Objective B. It was pretty intense.  There was a sniper up on the hill, which promptly shot the man next to me. With a 50 caliber bullet. Priority One-Run like hell. I ran for the bunker, and was greeted by angry men with knives and guns. Running away, I was sliced and died near a road. A nearby medic somehow healed my fatal wounds and I was back in the fight. I shot at some things with my M4 and was shot back at. Does this count as death one or two?  Back at the default base, I realize something. Half our team is camping the little birds. And since Marine003 was keeping the transport bird to himself, they were camping one helicopter. If you are not familiar with the map, the Joint Ops team base has a hill beyond one of the entrance/exit bridges. This hill lines up VERY well with the helo spawns. My team would just mob the helicopter, getting cut down all the way by snipers. Some would fire in the  general  direction of the hill, but not at anything specifically. So, I run off in a pretty cool looking Recon Buggy. By this time, the sun has set, and the Rebels are beating the crap out of us.  I don NVGs and blow past a group of our guys having a knife fight. Why are they fighting? I don't know but my guesses go in this order: OK, I lied. I don't have any guesses. After a another punctual death at the hands of Rebels, (What are these guys rebelling against?) the lag is becoming unbearable. I leave the server in search of another.  The rest of the evening is dotted with trying to find a server that can run without lag, and with out lots of asshats. The lag is a constant, and the asshats, they're not going anywhere. Where do all of these 14 year olds with DSL come from? I gave up at about midnight (I had started at circa 9:30) and played some Pandora Tomorrow. Hopefully the full game doesn't end up like this.   Ratings  Graphics: N/A My graphics card (Gainward GeForce FX5600) is on it's way out. I have to run at 1024x768 with all detail at low to get  acceptable  framerates. I cant be the judge on graphics.   Sound: 6 The sounds themselves are pretty mediocre. Yeah, they sound like guns, and that's about it. One thing I did like, however, was the very distict sounds between the Joint Ops and Rebel forces guns. You definitely know who's shooting at you. And believe me, your teammates will shoot at you.  A lot.   Network Performance: 3 It's crap. That's the only thing to say for it. Every server is laggy, and it's not just me. If this doesn't improve, the full game will be a complete flop.  Gameplay: 8 I really enjoyed the game when I could get some time with real players, not 14 year old fools. I like the piloting system, if you can manage to get a plane. Think BF1942 but  worse . Yes, it can happen. The minimap is nice, and I especially like how it shows were enemy fire is coming from. The vehicles are nifty, with the three gears, and getting around and fighting can be very pleasant, depending on who you play with.  Features: 9 There are tons of cool things that Novalogic presents a player with. My favorite has to be the already mentioned display of where fire is coming from. But there is also the command menu, the super-medic, the multi-gear vehicles, auto-run, and the in-vehicle chat system. They're all very handy, and they aren't wasted.  Overall: 6.5 The gameplay and features definitely make this game playable. The lag issues, lackluster sounds, and the overflow of asshats takes away a good portion of it, bringing it down to 6.5. If they can take care of the lag and encourage more team-based play in the full version, this game will be a solid 8.
