About mid- April, I got a phone call from the Inland Revenue tellin gme that they had been trying to send me a cheque for overpaying on my tax as I'm a student, but they had the wrong address. I corrected them and heard no more until I got home yesterday. Holding my last money in my hand (no joke) and three weeks till payday looked bad, until I opened a cheque for Â£150. Magic. Heh heh heh.  Still, it looks like we're going to get more bank holidays. Fine. It seems that we have about half as many as everyone else in the European Union and we deserve some more. Fine. I don't care but I'm quite happy to gat paid for a day that I'm not going to work anyway, as lonf as they don't just give you two days off in a row as there's not really anything to look forward to. Trouble is, the company I work for at the moment is a bit tight. They allocate just enough wage budget for us to get by and no more, so when there's a bank holiday, they can't cope with paying everyone extra. The other great thing they tried to do is to tell us that we weren't getting England only bank holidays as we were based in Scotland. Fine I hear you say. Ah, but stick with me, my story gets better. We can't have Scotland only holidays either, as we are run by a company in England. Bastards. Needless to say, this wasn't acceptable and was changed but it is a bit annoying that they should even consider it.  If they don't want to treat us right we won't stay. Simple  Jack
