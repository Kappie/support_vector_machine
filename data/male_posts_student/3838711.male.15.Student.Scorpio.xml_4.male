I'm baffled.Became thoughtful in class at around 11am, just tried to re-organise the jigsaw puzzle I've had in my mind for coming to a month. Still, it didnt help matters. Only became messed up again, and didnt know why. Dont know how many times I have to go through this before I can get my thoughts straight again. ITs like... so many thoughts just flashing in your mind... all in a split second. Before you get what that signal is, another one comes. Its just so... disorganised.   Had a talk with the VP today. Complained about that stupid, egoistic idiot whos been giving me nonsense when I did not step on his tail at all. At least it kinda settled the chain of unhappy events thats been going on since school term started. So much so for being a nice guy and keeping quiet for so long. Didnt see any need to go fight it out with him... when hes just aempty nutshell and I dont see the help of knocking some sense into him when its only deaf ears I'm reaching onto... Ah, to hell with him. Geta life, take a hike.   Had a shocking surprise when the geography test papers were handed out.. All the guys who were the usual passers failed big time, getting scores of 3 to 5 out of a max of 15... And I, gota 9/15 for it... and that made me the only passer out of the whole class. Even William, coming in second, missed half a mark for passing.. with only 7....  Which leads me to think... maybe it was just a stroke of luck... maybe it wasnt the full understanding I had which lead me to get this kind of mark.. I dont even dare to think I can even get a good mark... But looking at the content which I wrote, somehow, it just seemed I've understood it well... Why are there so many things that make me confused...   Went with Kun Long to Kovan, ate at Yoshinoya, since we had the discount coupons... but somehow my bill amounted to $8.50... guess that didnt help much... Then we walked around Heartland Mall, seeing comics and CD's. By the time we went out of the building, it was drizzling again, and it was extremely humid. I stood there, then slowly but surely I began to feel sticky and stuffy... yucks. The weather at that time.... really sucked.   Got home, bathed, saw Aaron's blog. Well he really is in the dumps.. again. Not surprising but, somehow, I feel hes kinda taking it too rough. Some people just choose to ignore the situation, and escape it from reality. On the other hand, he, took it upon himself, the suffering, the pain. Hes just carrying it all by himself....As he said,in the rainy hour, he shall lift up his worn sword, with that little strength he has left, with a body thats bruised and battered, andface up to the dragon thats ready to attack him anytime. Well I really hope he can get back to be himself again, and if u do see this, please, cheer up man. It just sucks to see myself in this state already.. and I definitely do not want this to happen to any of my friends... I know how it feels, and your state is worse than mine.. I do hope you canpick yourself up, and be yourself again. Soon.   Haha, I still remember what Mr. Denis Koh said to me the last time we chatted, "Practise what you preach". Told him those words he tried to encourage me with, were the ones I used on my friends, cheering them up, goading them to go on. I give advice from my POV, making my friends look at it from a "bright" side.But when it comes to my case, its a worse case scenario...a whole newcase to speak of again.I couldnt control it, goes into a total disaster, not knowing what to do.. and when I yearn for someone to be by my side at that time.. there is none. Me, myself,and my own thoughts. No POV's from other people. Bleah.   Ah well, still, things are as they were, nothing's changed, the same old me, in the seat, facing the PC, and blogging my stuff out. "People only remember bad things, good things dont last and slip by easily".   Nightz. Benedict signing out. Its been a thoughtful day.
