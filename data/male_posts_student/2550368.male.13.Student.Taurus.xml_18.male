I just downloaded the very nice outlook plugin, copyed a few 100 spam emails into a folder and some good emails into another folder. I told it to train itself and it did..  Now the test: I clicked on the ol' send-and-resive button and bam it downloads 2 emails. Email A (Ad for viagra) and B (Bounced email). With-in a second email A is put in the Junk Email Folder and email B is left untuched :)  LINKS:  urlLink spambayes main homepage ,  urlLink outlook "addin"  (All free and opensource!)
