We've had a fun day :)  Sheldon's mum is cool lol, and umm  small ;)   It took us 3:15 to get here, the familiar butt-ache kicking in.  I can't help stop giggling about that flash mobbing (thanx for showing me that Becky! LOL).  I just stuck my music on and went to sleep for the first half of the journey.  Dunno how long I'm staying here for, or what we're going to do while we're here!  Anyways, better be off to bed now... cya
