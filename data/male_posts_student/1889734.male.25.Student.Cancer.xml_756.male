Quote -  In an interview published Wednesday in the Rome daily La Repubblica, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo described the abuses as "a tragic episode in the relationship with Islam" and said the scandal would fuel hatred for the West and for Christianity.   "The torture? A more serious blow to the United States than Sept. 11. Except that the blow was not inflicted by terrorists but by Americans against themselves," Lajolo was quoted as saying in La Repubblica.   Back to me - "A tragic episode in the relationship with Islam"?????  How about chopping off the head of a 26 year old?  How about chopping off the head of a newspaper reporter?  Burning western contractors and hanging the bodies while the crowd cheered?  Blowing up Spanish trains?  WTC...twice?  Not to mention the myriad assortment of hijackings, suicide bombings and outright murder of anyone not a Muslim?  Where the hell does the Vatican get off with this?  I'm am so sick to death of the moral equivalence the rest of the world wallows in over Islam.  I am sick of the apologies, of blaming the west, of putting the burden of coexistence upon the civilized world while indulging in the casual racism of excusing the Arabs for behaving like animals.  Enough.
