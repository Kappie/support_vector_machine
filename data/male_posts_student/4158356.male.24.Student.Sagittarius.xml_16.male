We had a computer gaming party last weekend for about 14 hours straight, and my sister and baby are doing very well (the baby has grown a ton! see the pics below). I'm playing a lot of  urlLink Final Fantasy X-2  just to past the time (thanks Raymond), I think I'm about 1/4 the way finished... it's like playing a fantasy version of Charlie's Angels with the girls running around in skimpy outfits. :D Anyway hope everyone else is doing well and no one misses me tooooo much. Right now, I can't believe I'll be returning to the U in another week and a half!
