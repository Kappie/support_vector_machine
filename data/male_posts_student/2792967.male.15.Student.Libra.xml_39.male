I wont let it atrophe into digital decay. I would like to thank Jenna for Inspiring me to start a new blog. It was while reading her  urlLink blog  that I realised that I too needed a place to express my various rants and ramblings. In this blog, you will experiance my summer. Most likeley alot of whining about how I need a girlfriend. Anyway, Im off to play stepmania. *dances off*
