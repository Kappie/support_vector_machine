Anyway, I'm still in the library... however, Linden, the computer bloke, is coming round at around 6:00, so I should then be able to go on for a decent amont of time at home. Hooray!   V.7.2  of my site is now up and running, and I'm urrently in the design stage for a blog... if all goes well I should have a self-hosted blog by the end of the week, and I can stop using this one. Which'll be useful, reliability is always good.  Anyways, I'm going to... who knows? There's only so much one can do around here.  Love, Jon Roskilly
