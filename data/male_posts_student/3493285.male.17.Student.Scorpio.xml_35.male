I've also come up with two more additions to my list.    "Playing Favorites" by The Starting Line-the acoustic version "Thriller" by the king of pop himself Michael Jackson.  songs in current consideration: "Summertime" by (correct me if i'm wrong kara) Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong "Buffalo Soldier" by the reggae king Bob Marley "Fast Car" by Tracy Chapman   Hmmm...music is good. yes music yes. look at music go.  i just finished taking the SAT's today. it was..really not fun. i mean it wasnt awful because it wsa so hard, it was difficult yea, but the thing that really got me was how intensely boring it was. 3 and a half PLUS hours in one room. not able to talk. able to move for a total of 6 minutes. no food. no water. and if i smoked, no smoking. it was so horrific. it was kind of how i imagine hell being. it sucked sucked sucked.  you know i rant and rave a lot about bad drivers but again i had not one, not two, but three encounters with the same thing. i was driving down tv hwy going 47 mph, 2 miles over the speed limit--so i'm not going all that fast. and THREE cars pulled out in front of me. and they didnt speed up. it irritated me so much! i wanted to be like..what are you doing idiots?! seriously. it enthralled me. i was irate. because..seriously you DONT do that. you dont look..see a car coming rather fast..and then decide to go anyways and act like you own the world.  whoa, calm down neil. you know if i wasnt a selfish person as well, i'd be totally okay with that and let them in. yea..the car is becoming an angry place for me and i should fix that. definitely.  well i gots to get going..i'm going to see kara and andrea's recital in a little while and i have to get something to eat. hope the day is treating you well if you read this/when you read this. ADIOS!
