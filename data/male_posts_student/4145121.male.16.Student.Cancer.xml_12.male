How many? i lost my best dude this year. I can only blame myself about that issue. Yea. Other sad and regretable things that happened, I guess it's my fault too.Band's over. And it feels weird. 4 years and it just ends. Ah. I really don't know if I've accomplished anything now that i think about it. Yea...and, I don't know if I really did what I set out to do. Oh wells, it's up to the band to judge me in this case. O lvl coming. Stress and pressure does pile on you. no wonder my parents are trying to get me outta this education system. But...yea. I don't noe. Ah. There's nth much to cheer me up recently...and music's...haha. And not to mention the Amths and Mths work I get everyday. Can't play my tbone anymore, just feels weird...esp when I noe I can play alot of the pieces. Oh well. Life goes on. Whether you like it, or not.  when i first held i was cold a melting snowman i was told but there was no one there to hold before i swore that i would be alone for ever more wow look at you now flowers in the window it's such a lovely day and i'm glad you feel the same cos to stand up out in the crowd you are one in a million and i love you so let's watch the flowers grow there is no reason to feel bad but there are many seasons to feel sad glad mad it's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold but i am here to help you with the load wow look at you now flowers in the window it's such a lovely day and i'm glad you feel the same cos to stand up out in the crowd you are one in a million and i love you so let's watch the flowers grow so now we're here and now is fine so far away from there and there is time time time to plant new seeds and watch them grow so there'll be flowers in the window when we go wow look at us now flowers in the window it's such a lovely day and i'm glad you feel the same cos to stand up out out in the crowd you are one in a million and i love you so let's watch the flowers grow oh wow look at you now flowers in the window it's such a lovely day and i'm glad you feel the same cos to stand up out in the crowd you are one in a million and i love you so let's watch the flowers grow let's watch the flowers grow
