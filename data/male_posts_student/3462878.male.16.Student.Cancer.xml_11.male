Last April I started playing Kings of Chaos, which is, for those of y'all who don't know, an online Roleplaying game, where you start an army and attack other people. it's got Lord of the Rings races, like Orcs and Elves and stuff.   If you wouldn't mind, could you click this link and then press the number it tells you to  urlLink http://www.kingsofchaos.com/recruit.php?uniqid=v284k8b8   This is basically to get people into my army so I can kick more ass. You don't really have to, but it would make me very happy (:D)   Recently a new Age has been started, and all of the accounts have been reset, so I've pretty much lost all of my ass-kicking abilites. I'm slowly but surely clawing back though, I've even persuaded someone else to join.   Yey, go me
