Its funny how when youre writing an essay u think its long enough but when u actually read it out it doesnt take too long.. maybe coz i read too fast.. :D  Went to my cousin sisters house yesterday to celebrate her babies 1 month bday, which just makes me an uncle AGAIN for the ump-teenth time. Almost got lost looking for her house somewhere in Bukit Jelutong. We were in a 3 car convoy and it was somethin like the blind leading the blind since none of us really knew the way. When we finally reached her housing estate we made a wrong turning because we had directions to turn right at the field, unfortunately the leading car turned when they saw a patch of undeveloped land which they thought resembled a field.. so we ended going round the whole estate before finding her house.. and even then when we reached her house we almost went past it coz my aunty kept insisting it was further down the road when we were actually right next to it!! Luckily my mum and another cousin had the presence of mind to see the caterers outside the house and figure out that that was the house.. as for my aunt.. well she just drove further down the road till we called her and told her to drive back again... ahhh what would we do without handphones..??  To say a bit about football, i must say im quite happy that France lost(haha too bad for u Ken!!). it feels even better when they were beaten by Greece who were not supposed to make it past the group stages, and its also sweet revenge for them beating England during their group match... May The Upsets Continue!!!
