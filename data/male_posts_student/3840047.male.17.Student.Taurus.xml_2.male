The people of this age are the very paragons of this notion. This nation was galvanized into political uproar after claims were made that praise to a deity had no place, held no currency, in the pledge of allegiance. The unilateral rebuke was swift and strong, and this movement was soon silenced. In this age, in classrooms and workplaces across the nation, millions of citizens recite the mantra of the pledge. They are inculcated with these words, yet they have little if no comprehension of the magnanimous connotations behind them. This pledge is a promise to indivisibly protect and promote liberty, and to insure justice for all. Tell me of liberty whilst the government of this nation promotes legislation that blatantly curtails  the civil liberties of its people. Tell me of justice when the government of this nation incarcerates one thousand men without right to basic representation.There exist forces in this nation that willingly sully the name of freedom as a means of relinquishing the rights of this populace, who are ingenuously unaware that they live as slaves only by their own acquiescence. 228 years ago to this very day, perhaps to this very hour a people, not bound by race, nor bound by decent, yet united by creed, by the ferverent pursuit of the inalienable, immutable rights of life, liberty and justice for all, struck out against the imperialist forces of the world and built upon the foundation of hope perhaps one of the greatest nations ever to grace this earth. Ask yourself would these same founders smile upon the state of the union today, or should I say the state of the American Empire?
