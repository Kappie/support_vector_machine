You see I was very confused to begin with when i put this blog up so I had to go through my list of frequently used passwords/usernames, until I finally found the right one (YAY!).    So now I'm ready to blog it up once again! What's happened recently? Hmm, I got invited to a BBQ on Saturday so that should be hella-fun, I got the newest Ash album, Meltdown, which was a bit of a disappointment really :-/. Well, I have nothing but time to let it grow on me anyway.  I've also recently "discovered" The Cure. Which means that I've always known they were there, but I've never really listened to their music. And I'm glad I started to listen to them because they make very bootyful music, that's right, bootyful.    I got a link from my cousin which was to a site where I could check out my pornname.  Which is Cort Playah if you were wondering. We'll just have to see if I put that to use someday;).    Karsten
