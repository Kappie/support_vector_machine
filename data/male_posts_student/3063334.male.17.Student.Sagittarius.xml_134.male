Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is truly world class and the experience once in a life opportunity.  The awards and free stuff we got were only a temporary excitement, but the most valuable experience was making great friends from all 50 states and 40 countries around the world!!!!!! It's 100% probable that one or two friends you make in ISEF will be in the future leaders of the world, billionaires, or Nobel Laureates. The country and state pin exchanges, the plethora of ISEF ceremonies, all the social events were truly amazing. Furthermore, we the ISEF competitors got to be in a press like room with the Nobel Laureates as a panel. We were like the press asking the prestigious Nobel Laureates questions and they would answer us right there. It was truly astounding.   Yeah I guess the most important idea I've learned and experienced through this ISEF event is that seriously, there are sooooooooooooooo much talents and brainpower out there in the world, even with the everyday person around us. The project I did was just one grain of sand morphed into this vast lake of sand dunes stretching thousands of miles.  All the 1400 projects there were simply impressive.  I wil see everyone on Monday.   Thomas Chen
