When I returned home to my apartment, the common area was covered in stuff. The new roommates have arrived. They are okay and socialable. Todd's mother came down with them. She cleaned out all the kitchen and cleared out all the old stuff left behind. Even some year old food left in the frig. A brave brave woman.  Well, in the morning is Calculus again. I've missed 8 hours thanks to the confusion from Full Sail's system. Offically that would be a failure for the class. I'm going to have to get that erased. Tomorrow I guess I better get with a student advisor and see if I cant find some way around all of this mess.
