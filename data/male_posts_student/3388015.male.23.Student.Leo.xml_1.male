We hung out for awhile until the cable guy came around 5.  He was a little late.  But then we headed to Golden Port and ate great food.  We dropped Laura off and Cindy and I went to town and shopped in between trying to watch a movie at Movies 10 twice.  We never did.  But we did get to see neat furniture in four different stores and we explored Michaels and a Kitchen store in Henrietta.  I am going to love living so close to everything.  I dropped Cindy off and went back to Brockport.  Jake, Rach, Kristen and Will were packing Jake's UHaul.  Most everything is gone from the apartment.  It's kinda sad and kidna happy.  I'll feel completely normal and happy when I'm all moved into the new place and its set up.  I packed a bunch more and am going to bed.  I need to get up tomorrow, plan the route for the garage sales and then head to Rochester again.  Only 2 more trips that way until I no longer have to drive to Brockport.  Yay for me.  Night.
