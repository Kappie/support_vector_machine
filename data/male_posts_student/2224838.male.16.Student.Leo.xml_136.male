I'm really excited to see my grandparents and cousins again, for what will be the first time in about eight months. We normally only see each other during Thanksgiving, and occasionally we visit our cousins in Tulsa, Oklahoma, so this should be nice. The only downside to this visit is that we will only be staying for a matter of hours. Everyone seems to have obligations the next day, so it has been hard enough just to set aside a few hours. Anyway, we will be leaving for Columbus around 8:30 tomorrow morning and returning sometime in the early evening.  So, for what's left of today, I wish a happy birthday to my grandpa, and I look forward to seeing him and the rest of my family tomorrow.
