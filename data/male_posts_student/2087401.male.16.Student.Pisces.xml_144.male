I saw the article in the paper, realized it was the same time as we were going to lunch and then.. it just sort of fell into place.  In retrospect, it seems really crazy.  I mean, she watches Star Trek, but she's not as big a fan as me.  Still, she said yes.  I hope it works out; there's no going back now.   And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.
