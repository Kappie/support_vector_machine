           
      This coming Friday, I will embark on a journey that will test the mind, body, and soul. Myself, my friend Paul and his pops' will be hiking around Bonneville Dam or something. It should be tons of fun. We will be gone from Friday until the following Wed/Thursday. I will be preparing for the trek. I will also keep a journal of the daily events. Then I will put them on this blog and my web site. This trip will be a cross between Deliverance and the movie Alive.
