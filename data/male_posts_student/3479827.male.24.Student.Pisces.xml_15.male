After our previous record of 9 days of sweltering heat and sunshine, it seems i've done my usual trick of taking the weather with me. Rain, rain, rain, rain, oh and it was cold too. I think next time i try to come here, they'll stop me at the airport and say "hey, you're the geezer who makes it pour with rain in the middle of summer" and then put me on a one way flight to the sahara desert where i might be useful.  Anyway, i digress... Despite the weather, we were determined to continue our day as planned. We met yuqi's brother just outside the station who took us for a quick breakfast. After that we went back to his flat to shower, as we were less than fresh after the overnight journey. After watching the nba final on tv, we went out for lunch. The first restaurant we went to had a 50 mins waiting time for duck, so we promptly left to find another. We settled on another very nice restaurant where we met yuqi's brother's girlfriend hao xin. We had a lovely lunch including beijing duck, which i haven't had since last time. Don't believe the restaurants in the uk, most of the so called peking duck is cooked in a cantonese style and is definitely not the same.  After lunch, yuqi and i went off to visit tiananmen square, which took us a lot longer than anticipated. The beijing traffic varies between moving very slowly or not at all. Once at our destination, umbrella in hand, we went over to the imperial palace. Last time i visited the square, i never actually went into the palace for some reason. I was about to find out why that was a mistake!  To get to the palace you need to go through 2 or 3 absolutely huge gates which are impressive in themselves. You've probably seen the gate houses on tv, they're very frequently shown on any programs about china. After the gates into the palace, you realise the scale of the place. The palace is split over several buildings in an area akin to a village. Inside is some amazing architecture and exhibits (and, i must say the nicest tourist toilets i've seen yet) i really feel that any description or pictures will not really convey the scale and beauty of the place, i just hope you can see it for yourselves.   I'm writing this on the train back to shijiazhuang to go back to yuqi's parents house. We pretty much hopped straight on the train after our tour round the palace. We're both exhausted after so much travelling in the last 24 hours, we're looking forward to a relaxing evening. The journey's only 2 hours, which isn't too bad. So, until tomorrow, goodnight!
