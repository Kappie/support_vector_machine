Oh, and I just want to express my sympathy to anyone who has to deal with telling the Micro$oft tech person the 50 digit code to activate their version of windows over the phone, what a pain in the ass. And then they have to tell you a 50 digit number in return to complete the activation. Just too fun for me!
