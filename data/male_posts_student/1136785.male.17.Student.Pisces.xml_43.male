I wonder if I'll get any more im freak outs tonight. Those are getting really fucking old. It's sad that Ihope I dream about being homewhen I go to sleep.  I'm bored and doinghomework. Distract me. Please. I spent three and a half hours ona powerpoint about Baghdad last night. I should probably make even longer tonight. Who needs sleep? I don't, because I take afternoon naps.   Doopdy doo. Wish I was in Taiwan right now like my dad, brother, and sister. Lucky bastards. Especially with the increased political and military tensions in the area. Both China and the US have wargames going on the region. China is staging faux invasions on smallislands in the straight. I wonder if you could see that - that would be pretty cool. I've gotten pretty into the whole China Taiwan situaton as of late, what with rumors of Reunification/Invasion by 2021 permeating through the Party, and the threat that China will invade if any attempt a declaration of independence is made on the part of Taiwan. And President Chen definitely is pro indepedence as well. Twenty three million people live in an economicaly vibrant healthy democracy in Taiwan., with US assurances of protection despite it's "One China" policy. There's a showdown I'm don't want to imagine. China has moved five hundred ballistic missles to the Fuijan province across the Strait from Taiwan, and has many more forces. The most hardline in the party call for invasion by 2008. New Chinese Military theory is also advocating surgical commando raids and decapitation strikes rather than flat out bombardment of the Island - hopefully to keep most of it in one piece and wage a modern campaign. But we see how well an emphasis on keeping troop counts low and shock and awe is working out in Iraq. Only two million more people live in Iraq. I wonder how the Taiwanese population would react to invasion - would there be the same ground swell of resistance as in Iraq? I would think so. And if the US gets involved, we're looking at a conflict of disastrous proportions. The new wargames, designed to create new surging method of projecting a quickly crescending force of 150,000 men and seven carrier strike groups, more or less as needed, in less than a month are hardly anything to be scoffed at. Maybe I'll devote a full Boring, yet Important to it. Just cause I say so. And I think it's interesting, and isn't that all that really matters. Not like I'm doing this for you.  I'm gonna go back to being anxious and bored.
