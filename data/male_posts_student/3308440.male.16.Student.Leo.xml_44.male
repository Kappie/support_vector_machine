Soon I should be going to the cinema to see... Garfield the movie YAY!!!  I don't care if people think it's babyish or I'm sad because I'm going to see it because it looks really funny so it will be worth it, thats about it for now  See Ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Relaxed  Current music: Stereophonics - Is yesterday tommorrow, today?
