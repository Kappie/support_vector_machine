MUN yesterday; my working paper was generally agreed to be the only one (of four) worthy of consideration, and it was generally supported.  Josh Nathan (the UK, my biggest supporter), said, "I want to agree with Working Paper one-point...you!"  Last night, I wrote the following resolution; so far no one has responded or signed but that'll probably change soon.   Draft Resolution Iraqi Elections  Sponsor: Iraq Signatories: Republic of Congo, Malaysia, Myanmar   The General Assembly,  Recalling all relevant resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolution 1511,  Affirming the inalienable right of the Iraqi people to self-determination,  Encouraging the efforts of the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Governing Council, hereafter identified collectively as "the Iraqi transitional government," as well as those of the people of Iraq, to develop a free and democratic permanent government,  Recognizing the work of the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period, commonly known as the Transitional Administrative Law and hereafter referred to as "the TAL" or as "the Law," in laying the foundations for a permanent government of and by the people of Iraq respecting the liberties and powers of a free people to govern itself,  Noting potential security and other concerns arising from the tensions inherent to a nation recently engulfed in ethnic division, but maintaining an optimistic view of the future;  1. Decides, upon the due request of the Iraqi transitional government, to commission the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) to assist the upcoming election process by actions including but not limited to:  a. The advisement of the Iraqi transitional government on how to ensure a safe and effective election,  b. The supervision of both the general election structure and the particular voting system at each major voting place,  c. Such actions as are deemed pursuant to safeguarding the provisions related to the election of the National Assembly as described in Chapter Four of the TAL;  2. Recognizes officially the TAL as the Supreme Law of the Land in Iraq for the interim period (as defined in the Law), along with all of its provisions and preparations for the elections of the National Assembly of the future permanent Iraqi government and the transition to sovereignty with a timetable detailed in the Law;  3. Defines the recent proposals of Kurdish, Sunni, and other groups as legitimate expressions of such groups' respective voices, the rights of which are protected by Article 13 of the TAL, but which are nevertheless merely editorials with no actual weight on the determination of the Iraqi government;  4. Affirms that it is not the place of the United Nations to decide the government of Iraq noting the principles of self-determination and national sovereignty on which this organisation was based, and reaffirms that this decision already has been made by the people of Iraq in the form of the TAL;  5. Calls for, upon the due request of the Iraqi transitional government, peacekeepers to be sent to Iraq in order to maintain security in matters related to the establishment of the future permanent government of Iraq and elections thereto, including, inter alia, public rallies, campaign events, political speeches and demonstrations, and the voting itself;  6. Condemns the use of background checks on political candidates as an action fraught with the possibility of election tampering employed to keep certain groups in power, contrary to the democratic and free principles of the TAL, the future constitution of Iraq, and the United Nations;  7. Emphasizes the need for a more permanent security system for Iraq, protected by the United States of America in its role as the Occupying Power, a multinational force, and/or a United Nations peacekeeping force, eventually to transition to the control of the government of Iraq, in order to establish and maintain security in matters of Iraqi administration, elections, and other matters of national security, to be outlined in future resolutions and/or international agreements.
