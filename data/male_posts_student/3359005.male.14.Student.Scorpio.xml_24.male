I don't see why CBS hesitated so much about bringing this season back, cause from the first episode, I can totally tell this season's going to be absolutely awesome! My comments on the teams... Well sorry they're up so bloody late, my sis's been hogging the com!  Alison  Donny -- Everybody hates me, nobody likes me! I thought that Alison would come in with that mentality, but no, only her little Donny is upset with her, or so she thinks. Overall this is a strong team, even though I hate to admit it! I really don't see any place where Alison can lie and cheat in this game. Flirting, is a whole new story. Maybe, since flirting can only be done at the pit-stops off camera, she can slvage her deviled reputation.  Marshall  Lance -- Who the hell? How the hell? When they reached the pit-stop, I was like, "How did they get there?" They played an extremely insignificant role in this episode. It's either they are simply a boring team, or CBS is trying to keep them low cause they win the race. If another alpha-male team wins this time, I'm not going to be too happy, especially if it's this boring pair that thinks they're the Jon  Al and Ken  Gerard of this season. They might as well say they're the Rob  Brennan and Chris  Alex, since they're the only alpha males!  Karen  Linda -- Surprise, surprise! The bowling moms can actually do something. Do you actually belive that bowling is a sport mommies? The answer to that question lies in your physical condition. They only got eliminated by a smart but to a certain extent unfair twist in the flights. I mean they probably didn't even know that the second flight arrived earlier. I really liked it that they worked together in carrying that slab of beef. They weren't even tired after they completed the task. That's about the only thing rememberable that they did in this leg...  Bob  Joyce -- Our quiet couple of this race. They are very mild and nice people. Their lack in physicality, I believe, will bring them down in this race. They migh fluke like Teri  Ian, but I really don't think so. Letting the man do everything, my dear Joyce, is not right. You sould've help carry his backpack while he carried the beef. They remind me of an old couple in my church. The man had a stroke...  Charla  Mirna -- What can I say? GO GO GO THE LITTLE ONE!!!!! She said that she was here to break all stereotypes about dwarves, but to me she just displayed the exact thing I expected! I mean, after Gimli's performance in Lord of the Rings, I kind of think everyone's stereotype of a dwarf is: stubborn, strong headed and determined. She really impressed me with her firepower, zipping around everywhere like she was a cat on a race. Well she is on a race... Mirna's having the hots for Phil, that's going to be real funny! Too bad that we don't get to see the 12-hour intervals.  Brandon  Nicole -- Shame on you 2. Admidst high expectations, these 2 surely did not perform. They got on the second flight, and the twist in the flights surely saved them. Everyone, including myself, thinks they look like a carbon copy of Flo  Zach. They have in fact, displayed traits of being Flo  Zach. Nicole started whining in this episode, and it looks like she may be on her way to a number one spot that Flo has taken. Brandon, has not displayed Zach's wits, and basically that will bring this team down. Both models are heading for disaster with their most probable brainlesness (think Derek  Drew), but I'm looking forward to seeing whether they can beat Millie  Chuck in their christian proclaimations. Prediction, 4-5 place (think Derek  Drew and Millie  Chuck).  Colin  Christie -- The predicted power couples are surely not performing here, with Brandon  Nicole already down, these 2 went even "downer." They had the flight twist to blame, unlike the previous pair. I mean, who would expect such a smart, but evil twist? I really love their charisma and chemistry together. I do think they'll go far in this race.  Chip  Kim -- I do not like this team. There you have it straight in the face! Call me racist, call me anything you want, I DO NOT like this team. Firstly, they do not have the charisma and chemistry that the other couples have. Secondly, they made an absolutely stupid mistake. How can there be a task without the information? Booyah! I absolutely did not think they would make it to the pit stop so quickly. But I really pitied them. Phil should've just imposed a time penalty and got them over with it.  Kami  Karli -- They say the word 'manipulating' in a creepy, blonde way! All I want to say is mostly the same as Chip  Kim. Move away girls, Charla and Mirna are the smart ones that are going to manipulate Charla's glaring disability. The question is, do these bimbos do better than the himbos of last season? Probably not!  Jim  Marsha -- I would love to see Jim interact with Marshall. Imagine this, "Hi! I'm Marshall..." with Jim replying, "Really, I was only a captain!" Haha, sorry I'm being so lame. I kind of think he named his daughter afer the word Marshall... How stupid! Tearing your leg in the first few seconds just means this team is entirely incapable. Being the first Father/Daughter team, they are a huge dissappointment.  Dennis  Erika -- This team had the chemistry, the character and the charisma. It was really sad to see that they didn't have enough aggressiveness to be in the race. It was a sad, sad first bootee. It never pays to be nice in every reality show. I really thought Jim  Marsha deserved the boot more than these 2 did, but adious anyway!
