My dad chipped his tooth earlier in the week and had to go to the dentist in Pembroke, which is the closest to civilization to our cottage. The dentist put a temporary dealy on his tooth, and arranged an appointment with our family dentist for the next day. So my dad comes back up the day following his appointment, and tells me that there is a message on the answering machine from a local video store(where I had applied to just prior to leaving for the cottage) saying that if I was still interested in a job, to call by Friday. It was Friday. I immediately headed over to the phone and called the video store to let them know I was still interested, and to set up an interview. The following is a short transcript of that phone call, as best as I can remember it.  ... Brent: I'm still interested in the job, and would like to arrange an interview. I'm at my cottage, and I'm 4 hours away, but I'll be home on Saturday or Sunday of next week. Video Store Employee: Oh, the weekend.... I was hoping to have all of my interviews wrapped up by Tuesday or Wednesday, so that I could make my decision by Friday, and start training people the following week. Brent:.... ok, well I suppose I could drive home? Video Store Employee: That would be great, I have Tuesday or Wednesday. Brent: Tuesday. Video Store Employee: 2:30 or 3? Brent: 2:30 sounds good. Video Store Employee: Great, see you then. *click*  So that's it. One day and a 4 hour drive home later, I find myself at 1:32 AM posting on my blog. My interview is tomorrow at 2:30 PM, after which I will drive 4 hours back to the cottage. All this driving for a job interview.  I better get this job.  I'll be home on Saturday or Sunday.  Until next time.
