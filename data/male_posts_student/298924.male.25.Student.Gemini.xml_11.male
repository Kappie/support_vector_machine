I am really angry with the randomizer on winamp...I currently have a playlist of 595 songs (I call it slow mix...it's of the quiet storm variety) and yet it seems to play the same 20 or 30 songs when I am in the room....I put the songs on the list cuz I wanted to hear them....dammit!....(why do I like Blaque's version of "Time After Time"....and why did my winamp  FINALLY  play Duran Duran's "Come Undone"....)...what's that? You want a link to my  urlLink complete playlist ?.....be warned it is over 50 printed pages long....and takes a hot minute to completely download....  About Jeff George getting cut....it was inevitable....the Deadskins will stink the joint up all year but at least they won't have to deal with George's arrogance to boot....  Why did today go by so fast....it seems the days I am in the lab drag on and on....I go to the ICU tomorrow and I get to wear a shirt and tie and my white coat and look like a real doctor....  I am strongly considering joining Columbia House to get a few DVDs....any of you select few who read this please give me your input, yea or nay.  I got a chance to talk to the homies Kasi and JC today....I really am blessed to have been able to establish great friendships in undergrad....I can't wait for homecoming, not only because I will get to pick up the car, but to see the old crew....  My room smells really good right now, I am glad I decided to get that melon scented candle....now if I could do something about this cold temperature....  Well lets see what I can whip up in the kitchen....how appropriate that I am about to publish this and Stevie Wonder's "Rocket Love" starts to play....winamp has redeemed itself...
