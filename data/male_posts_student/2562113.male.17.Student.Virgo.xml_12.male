I don't know exactly what I will use this blog for, when I do decide to write in it.  But the purpose of this blog for me now, is to inform you of that decision.  Think about out it, do you really want to reveal every nit-pick of your life to others, so that they can form assumptions about you; assumptions which you would not find true to your own identity?  The less you expose yourself to others, the more mysterious you become.  Which means, you can hand-pick the people with which you choose to share your life.  It is a natural filtering system, that blogger.com graciously steals and spits upon, and feeds your mind with fallacies allowing you to think that you're keeping a "journal".  Subconciously, people understand this..  They understand that many of their peers will undoubtedly skim through their bloggers, enabling them access to personal experiences...  Yet, instead one's subconcious mind will just keep revealing and revealing, until they're numb to the fact that others are making judgements and assumptions, until one reaches the point where he/she simply goes overboard with what they're saying about himself/herself.  You only have one life, once you allow others to absorb knowledge about you into their minds, it has the potential to remain there forever.  Shadiness is "god's" gift to you, use it wisely.  You might be saying to yourself that it is hypocritical of me, the author, to reveal knowledge about my views to the reader.. But I'm trying to do a favor for the people, and I'll take my chances with just this bit of information.  You see, I find an exhiliration (maybe not to that extent) in sparking thought into others...  It's just the kind of person I am.  I hope I got you thinking, I apologize for bringing these pessimistic views to the blog.  Well..  I've revealed to much, I'll be on my way.
