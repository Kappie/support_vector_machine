Do you know how much time it takes to 1. load the page(i know mine can be VERY slow sometimes) 2. read it and 3. make sure you didnt miss any other entries? A LOT!  Anyway, onto my next topic.  If i ever catch you referring to something as "gay" when you mean "stupid" or "overly unintelligent," you're getting punched in the nose. This is your warning.  Gay doesn't = stupid! It has 2 meanings, you know which two. And if you don't, fuck you, you're lying. You know which 2.  I say homophobia, even when i refer to people who hate gays/think its wrong, because those people have NO FUCKING business talking about it. It's not wrong, or disgusting, you're just too afraid to let it go. My best friend, whenever something gay happens on tv, he asks me the same question: "Don't you think gay sex is wrong?" and I always give him the same answer. "No, because we have no business talking about it." then we get into the same fucking conversation about how I'm convinced that it's biological, and some people just don't realize it until later, and he says "no, some are born gay, but some become it later" and I say "No, they're just expected to like girls, and they try to, and realize they can't." If he wasn't one of the most kick-ass people in the world otherwise i would put him on my "Deserves to be eaten" list.  Topic #3:  " asdf pso for a minute "  can SOMEBODY explain to me what this means?  Somebody i know has this as their away message, and it pisses me off, because 1. it probably means nothing, and 2. asdf is what they use in that fucking typing class to tell us "where to start" in typing. I already knew how to type, i taught myself. But still, i had to pretend like i was using the slow-ass method of keeping your fingers on the middle of the keyboard in that uncomfortable position, then when the dumb-ass teacher walked along past me, i'd speed up in my normal method again. THEN she has the nerve to tell my PARENTS that i'm hunting and pecking! What the hell, i wanted to slap her!(on more than one occasion, like how we didnt even see a computer in COMPUTER CLASS until half the fucking semester was over). You people from travis who had her know what i mean...  Anyway, I'm getting off-topic, back to "asdf pso for a minute."  Half that fucking sentence was an abbreviation!  Gimme an A!  Gimme an S!  Gimme a D!  Gimme an F!  I'm one of the people that would hear the cheerleaders say that crap and I would yell something like "No, fuck you!" for each letter. You know how i feel about cheerleaders from an earlier post.  I'm done for now, they better have fixed my game by now... grrrrr.....
