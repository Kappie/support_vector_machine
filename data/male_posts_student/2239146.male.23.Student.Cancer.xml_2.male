This outpouring of My Spirit is coming very suddenly and, unfortunately, a great number of My people will not prepared.  In fact some won't even think that this outpouring is of Me, this will cause an unexpected division many people will leave churches looking for something not as extreme, and that is what they will find. My children, do not focus on this division because it is because of My Spirit, yes MY SPIRIT, and after this seperation in the church there will be a massive increase.  You may even find that there will be even more numbers in the church than before.  The oncoming outpouring is about to bring a release to many in the church who are under bondages, and I am releasing the ministers of My Word to speak freely to the broken hearts, and I will heal them once again.  Do not focus on the division or the people who leave, but instead focus on Me, and prepare yourself so that you don't sit by idley and search for something without My Spirit.   Focus on Me only  and you'll only see the profit of and the good of this mighty movement.
