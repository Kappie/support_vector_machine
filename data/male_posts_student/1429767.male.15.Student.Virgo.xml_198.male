Let me tell you IT IS AWESOME! It's the best so far that I've heard from them besides "Perfect", it sounds like a softer song and that's what I've come to like. The addition of an acoustic guitar is amazing I think even though I haven't heard much of it I'm LOVING IT! I wont sleep tonight now since I'm REALLY excited about the tour I mean wow! I'm literally shaking right now!
