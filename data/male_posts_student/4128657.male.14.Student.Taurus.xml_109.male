Spanish (Distance learning)  School begins Monday, August 23 at 7:45 A.M. !!! Next week all students will be issued a set of books that they keep at home.  Another set of books will be kept in the classroom for students to use.  No more heavy backpacks!!  The school only has lockers in the locker rooms in the gym--keeping a set of books at home elimates the need for lockers.  He also bought PE clothes--nice colors-maroon, silver, and black.
