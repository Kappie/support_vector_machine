Too bad for them =-( that means my mom won't be home today. It really is sad. Oh well, she'll be home later on.   I think yesterday was the best day I've spent with Cassie yet. It was field day so we didn't have any classes. Which meant that I got to spend most of the day around her at least and we even got to flirt a little (Yes   we   as in us, both of us) Or I guess you'd consider it flirting. Either way I had a blast. I guess part of the reason was because she didn't take her medication that morning and was hyper, but that's fine by me =-)  On to yesterday after noon, I got to go out and mow that yard since it's supposed to rain on and off today. And guess what happened when I was about to go outside? Cassie got on. Luckily she wasn't going to stay on long anyway so I didn't feel  tooooo  bad. I still wished the whole time that I could be in talking to her even though I probably wouldn't know what to say.  Today I went out side and got to use our weedeater on the bank down near the road. That's always fun because you get your arms shook off. Now I'm going off to help my next-door-nieghbor do hers. It just so happens she's my grandmother =-) Anyway, I might write later but I don't want her to wear herself out. See ya.
