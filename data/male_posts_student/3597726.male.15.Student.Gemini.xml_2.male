It was such a thrill to see her enjoying herself. Continue to keep her in your prayers. She is sooooooo cool.   Okay, I know I'm a day late, but i was really busy yesterday. But, anyway, here's some stuff about the missions trip I promised to throw on here....  We arrived at Davis  Elkins College at about 6:40 and spent the rest of the evening eting pizza, singing, and playing basketball.   The next day, Daniel (Esig) and I were ordered to dig a a path for a drain box in sinking sand. Worse. It was like 200 degrees out...so we went half naked. By the end of the day we covered in mud from a few aggressive negotiations...anyway, we had sunburn allover our backs with spots scattered white spots the size mrables of where the mud used to be. We went around guarding our backs the rest of the week...especially from nick...jk.  Nothing else great happened until Whendsday, except for scraping and painting a small church. That night, us guys, Daniel (Essig), Noah, Nick, Isaac, and I stripped down to our boxers and held a few gladiator wars with pillows. It was so fun, Then Isaacs like if anybody goes running down the hall past th girls dorm i'll do it too, and so were all like 'yeah, we'll do it' and so we ran out our door and up and down the hall. Isaac screamed like a girl the entire time. Sarah saw us as she came up from the steps. It was so funny. She was like 'Ahhhhhhhhh!' It was really funny. THe rest of the night was spent singing 'All in All' to different versions of music. LIke Death metal, Rap, Country...you get the picture. Isaac played guitar.   Thursday, I was sent from my normal job to a church that i had helped put a roof on last year. Anyway, Mr. Ward sent me up into the bell towar where the handed me panels to screw in.   On friday night, we got these hanks pop bottles and filled each with a different amount of water and paraded around the dorms composing lullabylic tunes...sorta. IT was really fun. Then noah and i sang 'what do you do with a drunken salor' from our dorm window, and Noah satrted yelling to Isaac and Jen down below. THen he decided to give them a scare so Nate held Noah out the window, to make sure he didn't fall out the window, and Noah started unzipping his pants. Anyway, Mr. Birchler came in cause we were being too loud and Nate let go of Noah and dove behind the couch and Noah didn't seem to notice. And Daniel was like 'Noah? Uh...Noah? Noah?' and Noah finally turned around with his flys down and saw mr burchler and ran to a corner where he could zip up his pants. LOL!  THats about it for events. Probably one of the coolest things that happened to me was that we all got a salt shaker witrh a person's name in it. Whatever person we got, we were supposed to encourage and pray for. I got Katie's! I was so happy! But just because the missions trip is over doesn't mean i have to stop praying for her.   The Lord is so good!
