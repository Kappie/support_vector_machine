I got it to be on the page, but...it's a little high for my taste. In this update, I'm going to try to fix that up for my own state of mind (haha!). But, alas, I am waiting instead for my ride home. I was told by my friend that I could get a ride with him because he got lisence today (did I spell that right?). So, he was going to pick me up in his brand spanking new '98 Monte Carlo LS (whoohoo), but, at 15:30, he still isnt here, and it is a about an hour after school ended. LOL! After I got done typing that last sentence, his mom just pulled into the school traffic circle thingy, which happens to be right in front of me. Aight, I'm going to try to fix that annoying thing on the tag board. Later y'all.  --Clash
