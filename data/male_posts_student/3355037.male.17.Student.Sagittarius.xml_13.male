'tis about langdon, the military and myself. langdon, supposedly, is going to be joining the army now instead of the air force. apparently the air force doesnt want him back. hahaha... that sounded mean but its my brother, he doesnt matter. hahaha...  anyways where was i? ah yes. after seeing my act score i decided that i was going to apply at the air force academy. chances are, as of right now, that i will be hard pressed to be accepted. they are looking for many extracurricular activites and all i got is stupid work. yay. but anyways. i was speaking to langdon, discussing my military options, and he brought up the national guard. usually i would absolutely reject the guard porque no me gusta. ah! i have spoken the language of satan! but back to the subject now. apparently i have the option to join the guard right now, go to BT this summer, then when i apply at the academy (and if i am accepted) my guard obligation will be voided. meaning i can get out of it then. all the while, the guard would look very good to the academy. hey look, a new paragraph.  last night i had the worst sleep ever. i went to bed at around 1030 thinking i might actually get some sort of good night's sleep but NO!, the korean doesnt deserve to have a peaceful night. i awoke at 2 to find my computer still on somehow (cough*langdon you bastard!*cough) after shutting it down, i could not get back to sleep at all. so i went to get some cereal and then watched videos until i had to go to school. i dunno.   good news. apparently TYRONE might actually come back to work. hooray. Glick is also coming back for the summer before he goes to college. double hooray. speaking of Glick, i feel i should be somewhat sad or whatnot that i wont see him for a long while next year. usually that would suggest some sort of going away gift to him (i.e. graduation gift) but screw that. sorry Glick. you know where i work so you know i dont have money.   i cant wait to graduate. school is so overrated. especially the last few weeks. in mr.b's what are we doing? watching movies for 2 weeks. come on now. just let us go home. but after high school should prove to be interesting. hell, half a year from now should prove to be VERY interesting. emphasis on the VERY if you could not tell. i wish i had more of a life right now... i blame that on my parents. arr... but to leave on a good note... i dunno. um... the sky's stil blue? shoi.
