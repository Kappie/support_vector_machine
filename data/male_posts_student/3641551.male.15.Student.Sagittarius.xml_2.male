It starts with something on the back of my mind telling me studying is useless and time-consuming. It's like a seed and slowly grows until it fills my entire mind with an immense hatred of studying. So I just let the seed win and I stop and since I wanted to stop in the first place, it's not a hard decision. Although some times in extreme situations like one or two days before anexam I can actually  tahan  for an hour.    Is this bad ?    Nah, it's normal.     The seed just typed the last statement, not me.       A perfect example is the Geography Motivational Test, which I was supposed to study for, the night before but failed miserably. Although the beer I drank the exact same day could have played a part in it. Speaking of the motivational test I actually found it manageable despite not studying for it.  Maybe Mdm Siva has a use after all.       After the test 403 played with 404 in a soccer match which I didn't participate in. I went with  Mr. Sensitive  and  suaku  to jelita to eat pizza hut. In the end I invented a new way of eating pizza,to eat the ingredients and cheese but not the crust.    After that I went to photocopy all of Jonathan's English file worksheets. It cost a  f***ing  $6.60 and I had to do it manually some more because it was  f***ing  self-service. By the way, I didn't tell him I took his file so don't tell him.    When I returned home I found something that profoundly irritated me.    The file was in my house all along.    After issuing a couple of highlyexplicit vulgarities, I finally calmed down...     CE BIA !!!
