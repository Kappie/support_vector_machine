So, I'll probably be switching perspectives throughout the writing of this "book" I've got going here.        Skin cancer: It's supposedly one of the top killers in the Pacific Northwest, but I'm not so sure. You always see these commercials about people dying from sitting out in the sun for too long, and it got me thinking...   1. What's so big about getting a tan in the sun? Couldn't I just sit in the oven for a while? It's certainly a lot safer than going out with all the UV rays and stuff. 2. Can sun-dried tomatoes get skin cancer? 3. If sun-dried tomatoes  can  get skin cancer, shouldn't we put sunscreen on them? 4. Wait, forget number 3, sun-dried tomatoes are gross, so why worry about them anyway?  As I was thinking these things, I was also laying out on the lawn in full sun. I heard the familiar creak of the screen door, and turned to see who was coming to "chat." Before I saw the person, I saw what they were carrying in their hand... BANANA BOAT!  NOOOOOOOOOOO!  It's all gooey and sticky and gross and stuff! I then looked up, horrified, into the face that greeted me. "Fred Meyer's had a sale on sunscreen, and look! It's 33% more free!" I got up and started walking towards the house. "Where are you going?"  I responded, "I'm just gonna sit in the oven for a while."
