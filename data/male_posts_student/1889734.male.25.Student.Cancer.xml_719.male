Screaming, bitching up and down, saying to me "just where you left off from last season!",  you suck, etc....  Rightfully, I shoulda given him 10, but this kinda thing doesn't bother - I find it entertaining, actually, and he was rather creative.  Still, my adrenaline was pumping, and it made the rest of the game quite interesting....  I had to give him AND his hard-ass brother more penalties at the end of the game.  Stupidity....It confounds me that they have to be such assholes about it - they're not getting paid, they're not even getting trophies - hell, they're 'the best team' out there and they didn't even win the championship last year!   The slightest infraction from the other team - an accidental trip or whatever - and they're ready to kick the shit out of the whole team!  Inane....  Then, the second game was a blowout - the squad of kids vs the squad of central grads that've played together for 5 years or more.  On play where I was the high ref, the puck was in the crease being batted around...I'm drifting in whenthe other ref blows the whistle, so I skate in hard because the puck is under the goalie somewhere.  I go to stop (moments later it occurred to me that I may have been trying an ice stop) and slide onto my knee, hip, and ass-in that order.  HILARIOUS, as I was the only one moving at the time!    A couple of the Central grads are irredeemable asses, too.  The were blowing out the kids and one accidentally got the stick up high - didn't come close to hitting him.  He said something threatening, then on the next rush fired a ROCKET at the head of the other goalie - a stiff and talentless giant with neck and belly flesh sticking out of ill-fitting equipment - and CONTINUED to fire it as hard as he could from any angle regardless of who was in the way.  Can't call a penalty for that, though.   (I did call one last year when a jerk fired it deliberately into the other bench.)   Mark, have you ever experienced that kinda play, from either side?  If someone fires at your goalies head like that, what would you do?  Would/did YOU ever fire it like that?  These people are missing the point of the game.  Sure it's grand competition, but it's supposed to be fun - especailly Inline.  It's not supposed to be rough or eminently dangerous.  What are they REALLY angry about?  missed opportunities?  bad domestic situations?    Who poured vineger on YOUR fruity pebbles?!    Does Tibet have a national hockey team?
