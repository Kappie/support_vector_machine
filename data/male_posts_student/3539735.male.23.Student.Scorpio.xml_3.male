No need to shout about what it is or isn't, right? A cat has four legs, a tail, black ears and black face, greying, a sagging belly that should sway when she walks graceless thumping steps across our wrought-iron coffee table. What we know or don't  won't change it (right?).  My eyes are cat detectors: the itch just beneath the lower lid: my eye: another machine. Filled with tears. Itchy. Sees more than cats, but feels them, most acutely.   I lost a friend today. She had been sick - sicker than seemed right. Her sleekness became ragged; something was eating her inside. When I took her in it was cancer, of course. She asked me to look after her cat.
