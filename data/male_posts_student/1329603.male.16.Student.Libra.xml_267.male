I owe this mostly to 3 people:    Jazz   Nikki   Laura    Reasons why will be explained post haste. Chronologically, of course. Why, when people look back on this in years to come, I want them to understand my emotions of the day. Actually, no, I just want to be boring and set out, leave me alone i_i.  Had CAYO this morning, which was, although not musically better than usual really, was socially better, in that I made less of a tit of myself, made jokes which people laughed at, didn't feel as outcast in the group of my peoples, and got some hugs of Jazz which she owed me. Being hugged gets me in a good mood in general so that was a nice start to the day - thanks my love *hugs*.  Then was off to Nikki's party, which was good after my mum and myself got lost trying to find the arsing place. I texted Laura who told me it was in Withington, which was surprisingly helpful (no sarcasm), but there our luck kinda ended, on account of not actually knowing what end of Withington, what road, or... basically anything about where Nikki lived. Bugger. Found out later that Laura had got lost too... about as much help as an ashtray on a motorbike, that girl :P. Anyway, spent a long (by long, I mean couple of hours type long) just phaffing about on the piano and guitar and such, and generally being the life and soul of the party (here, there IS sarcasm. It's a fine balance.)... course, it took me nigh on an hour and a half after Laura entering for me to drum up the courage to talk to her... this is the me-being-paranoid-about-being-me thing again. The real ice breaker was me sucking at badminton so much that I let someone take my place and thought I couldn't do anything worse than I'd played it (it was fun, but I still suck), so I went and talked to Laura who offered me a seat, which I willingly accepted and filled for a couple of hours. Talking to, and seeing Laura, was really cool again, so that was really funky. Got tired and kinda lent on her a bit, which I'm not sure if she minded or not but it seemed not so I just kinda was comfy. Nikki is also  surprisingly  good at the piano. I say surprisingly because she's never mentioned it to me. Oh well, well done her, she's better than me :(. Then again I'm not all that good, so I'm not really that depressed *ties noose into rope*.  Also ended up talking to Brendan a fair bit, convinced Will that his name was Matt (he looks like a Matt, I tells ya), and discussing male labour with John. For a group of L6 peoples, I think I managed rather well.  Also had a wee chat with Laura a bit ago about... well, you can guess. She said something to me that I thought I'd find really upsetting or depressing or whatnot but I'm surprisingly OK with it... I don't know. At the moment, it's clear to everyone what I wanna do, but I'm fine with life either making that happen or not making it happen in its own time. I don't need to be soppy and express all my feelings here, you all know them. If you don't, don't hesitate to ask, and I'll tell ya. Strange, really, that it didn't detract from a great day... in fact, she ended up making me feel a lot better about the whole thing. Love ya.  Quote of the day: "Mama, just killed a man, Put a gun against his head, Pulled my trigger, now he's dead."  From...   Love, Jon Roskilly
