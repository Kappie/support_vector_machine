While The Buggles did little afterwards, the song lives in history, often played at retro dances, and cooed over by erstwhile 80s fans.  Myself included.  I loved the hell out of that song as ealry as 1994...it was a bit of new wave, and was the beginning of the movement that I identify my musical tastes with.  As a young person wanting to establish myself on the alternative wavelength that I saw Megan Basco and Jessica Zeitler playing with, I used to closely analyze the song, and give my interpretations, as well as why it was such an obvious choice for first video (as opposed to a Rod Stewart song...little-known fact is that MTV had 57 "honest" music videos when they started, and 25 were by Rod Stewart).    All of that in mind, I went to Borders yesterday for some media shopping...they were having a 20% off sale for students, and I knew I could find something.  And I lucked out on a 40-song 80s New Wave compilation, with a number of songs I'd never heard of, and a number I had and didn't remember (The Outfield's VOICES OF BABYLON; Red Rockers' CHINA; Freur's DOOT DOOT; Eurogliders' HEAVEN).    But the one that stuck out was by Bruce Woolley  The Camera Club...VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO STAR.  I wondered why a New Wave comp with such alt songs would throw a cover on there, when the song being covered was the poster child for trendsetting.  So, with roommate Evan in tow, I threw the song in the CD player, looking over the liner notes.    Song comes on, and immediatley it's more peppy than The Buggles, starting with a alt-robotic homonym sing at the beginning just set to drums, and then the orchestra comes in.  First stanza is done just to synthesizer, with the lead singer putting zip into the song.  The thing was moving, and by the time they got to the chorus, I realized that I liked this version more than the original.    It's rare that I enjoy covers so much...Johnny Cash's HURT is definitely one, and the new Simply Red cover of I CAN'T GO FOR THAT is pretty good too (and Miles Davis totally rocked out on Cyndi Lauper's TIME AFTER TIME).  But this was catchy, edgy, and full of something that the first one lacked...something that I couldn't place.    But it meant something that a song that is considered by any musician to be movement-defining would have a better cover.  The liner notes looked to be little help until I spotted the date of release for Camera Club:  1979.  The Buggles' video was in 1981.  Now, quite often groups will get covered immediately after a song is put out there...After The Fire covered DER KOMMISAR six months after Falco sang the german rap, and LeAnn Rimes covered HOW DO I LIVE at just about the same time that the other chick sang it.    What it brings up are questions of ownership, of authenticity.  The Buggles made a video in 1980, that played in early 1981.  The Camera Club sang an incredible version of the song in 1979.  Why, if The Camera Club's cover was so catchy, did The Buggles (whose song was pretty hip too, don't get me wrong) get the video and the lifetime of credit?    Unless it wasn't The Camera Club that covered it.    I got online to search Bruce Woolley  The Camera Club, a daunting task, as there are no fan pages, and just some random links for vinyl and out-of-print wares for the band that gave synth pioneer Thomas Dolby his first break.    But that was enough information to get to the goods.  Dolby is a cult legend, for anyone from thirtysomething geeks to current club mixers.  Regardless of if you like SHE'S BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE, his impact was created, built upon, and the science guy with glasses had a following.    And through a fan site, I found the truth...Dolby played with The Camera Club, and yes, The Camera Club was the band to write and record VIDEO KILLED THE RADIO STAR...which was soon thereafter covered by The Buggles, who found out about MTV and made a video that will be remembered for quite a long time.    And nothing against The Buggles for doing it...great job for a couple of old guys who never had a song come close to hitting after that.  But the trivia shouldn't start and stop where it does...you might miss out on the top version of the song.
