TAM ASKED FOR IT! SHE SOOO ASKED FOR IT. WHATEVER SHE SAYS, SHE HAD IT COMING. KARMA! mei-shan's cool, she didn't go through the whole teen angst thingy so she's allowed to like pink cars. rita had that gangsta walk like she's above petty gatherings like carwashes but i ain't trippin. selena tried to retaliate for a meek sud attack from yours truly but heather valiantly protected me from inexorable doom and death (actually, i just kinda hid behind her). course, heather hulked up and took care of business, but that's another story. jen wong drove in her spiffy avalon, we tried to trap her inside with hoses; she eventually escaped, but not without enduring terrible battle scars that will last forever. she had the audacity to threaten not to pay just cuz of that inconsequential water attack! and just cuz she's '05 prez, and a varsity basketball star, and a varsity track star....psht that's nothing...  then i went to alex's house for his birthday party. he, simran and sloan were there staring at like a mountain of model cars perched precariously on the pyramidical precipice of peril. whatever. we sim'd me and sloan v. alex and simran on nba 2k3, and sloan kept on going yes! whenever i scored. "sloan, that was ryan..." it was actually sorta close, simran kept on missing EVERYTHING. just like in real life :D we went out to play, natasha, gayzel and sindy arrived, alex's cousin michael came out and i tried to make him play, failing miserably in the attempt. kevin came, we all went in and watched the ring, simran kept on fondling kevin ("why aren't you acting gay?" "not TODAY, simran"). alex's sister rachel interrupted the spookiness in the middle (the shutter's were swinging =O or maybe it was just the wind) and took pics, alex gladly sat on simran's lap and then simran like...fake-kissed him? something. kevin had to leave early, cool movie, first time i saw it (yes i'm a loser). went into alex's room and saw triumph at hollywood squares (tom bergeron: "is it healthy to shave your dog?" or something, "i don't know, personally i would rather shave my pussy...cat! i said cat!!"). we kept on waiting for erik to come, when we thought it was him we all stared at the door cuz he always turns hecka red. we ate pizza, gayzel, natasha and sindy had like 5 slices each.  erik finally came, we played basketball again, then rachel came out to take pics again, alex got behind simran who got behind erik but they moved, then erik squatted, "what are you doing? taking a crap?" "no, i'm squatting!" "yea, squatting to take a crap!" the girls listened to my ipod attentively as alex's cousin krystal ran out and yanked gayzel's hair straight off the scalp. then michael started chasing krystal in circles. kinda cute. we went inside to eat cake, then watched NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. DAMN I HATE THAT MOVIE. JOHNNY DEPP...EWWW. erik kept on poking me. grrr. pokes are evil. *poke* 1 damage! natasha left cuz she saw the movie, but she came back to scare the living nightlights out of sindy and gayzel. she was talking to keagan...bwhahaha...we went to alex's room and caught natasha chatting, we tried to see her convo but she kept on pressing escape. then we played hide and seek, it was ok but really nowhere to hide, i spooked sindy twice in a row, i HELLA got natasha and she smacked me. everytime i tried to scare gayzel, she was like, ow. alex crawled on the floor once, which freaked everyone out. we played around with alex's dartgun and his very pliable glasses which i think are too big for him. i wallopped sloan with a pillow, sloan got me back with a DART FROM HELL though. then we played life and i was stuck with one of alex's old toy cars cuz we were missing the white car. i annoyed everybody with the rules and strategy. alex and gayzel both went on spring break while sindy bought books and went to study in europe. we had a gigantic six-some on top of my car but then the girls had to leave, so me and sloan watched triumph at the star wars premiere (middle-aged darth vader: "this button controls the sound of my breathing." triumph: "does this button tell your parents to go pick you up?"). FUNNY. some girl was there..."how does it feel to be surrounded by guys who have no idea how to please you?" then erik left, alex got hella bored and talked to gayzel online, and i left.
