What I realized as I listened to the Wall this evening was how much more predominant the random noise in songs are in the mix.  Between the heavy echo and panning of lead vocals coupled with random car squeals and children's choirs, its easy to see why the Sex Pistols happened.  But I still love the album, despite the fact that it just sounds like an ego trip.
