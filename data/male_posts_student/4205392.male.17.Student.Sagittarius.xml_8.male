There must be something clearly wrong when McCain, who I believe actually possesses moral fortitude, starts to speak out against challenging Kerry's military career. I wholeheartedly agree with the Daily Show's tribute to Kerry ("He's NOT Bush"), and although I do not believe Kerry is a great leader, I think that McCain makes a very good point in telling both sides to stop the mud slinging. I mean, it's like dissing a guy's car, desktop, or computer in general. That's just wrong.
