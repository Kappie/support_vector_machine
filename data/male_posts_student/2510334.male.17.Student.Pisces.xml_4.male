At the moment I am just finishing my exams in my first year of sixthform. So that's the basic me, looks like a normal seventeen year old? I guess I am...  At the moment I am a bit of a lodger at my mum's friends house until the end of my final year of college, this being due to the fact that my mother decided to move 200 miles away to live with her boyfriend (a fat, controlling egotist, who I anyone to fond of). So along with my 15 year old sister I fend for myself in this fast paced and dangerous world... Well its not really that bad, I do get cable and broadband in my room and less of the nagging, but its the little things you miss, like the odd Â£5 here and there. As for my dad, he moved toSpainn at thebeginningg of the year with his new girlfriend and they split up within 3 months.Thoughh he did decide to stick it outIi don't know how long he ill actually last.AlllIi do know is thatIi get a free holiday to sunnySpainn this august.  Other things in my life that are very important to me include my boyfriend, Martin; we have been together now for 8 months andIi know that to some people that 8 months doesn't sound like much we are very happy together andIi hope it will continue to last for a long time.  That's about me for the first blog andIi hopeIi can keep on up-dating you on me and my situation.
