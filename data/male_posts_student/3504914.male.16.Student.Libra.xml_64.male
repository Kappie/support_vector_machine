We know that doing drugs is bad for you. We know that drinking is bad for you.   Its common knowledge now, we see evidence of it daily, on the telly, in the news, wherever. And yet people continue to do it, why?   In this same light, I know that my argument, no matter how valid in my own eyes, may not hold that same jurisdiction in anotherâ€™s.   Therefore I may not judge somebody for not listening.   There, it took me a while to get this outlook but there you have it. By just looking at this from another angle, my general anger at that silly argument has been quenched xD
