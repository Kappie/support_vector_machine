Link is on the right toolbar thing. Big purple button. Can't miss it.  Today was pretty damn good. Only *properly* got up at about 1pm, then went and played tennis with Joe. The tennis combined with riding there 'n' back, for some reason, nearly killed me. I'm completely worn out. And might fall off my chair at any moment.  In Euro 2004 news: The final (to be played on the 4th of July) is going to be between Portugal and Greece. Which is interestingly the same fixture as the opening game. GO GREECE (again). And I just had a good session of beating the living crap out of Warrilow at Nike Ole. Woohoo.  There was some pretty bad news, but I'm not gonna post it here. So if you really wanna hear it talk to me tomorrow. =P  Oh, and: The sites hit counter is going upupUP pretty fast. 74 hits in a day and a few hours of yesterday. And one of 'em was from Taiwan. *woohoo!*
