They told us the truth about Canada. *Note: None of these are probably true*  Niagra Falls: Imagine you being a fish. You fell down the falls, and you can't get up. There isn't an elevator or an escalator. You are stuck down there. It's like college, except without the wetness, and the fish.  Canada's Maple Leaf Flag: When John Canada first discovered Canada he was trying to figure out the what should be on the flag. Once he got all the colors figured out, he couldn't decide what to put in the middle. Just than, a maple leaf fell down and landed in the middle. There you have it. So as John was tracing the leaf, an apple fell down. Now, if he had delayed a little longer, there would be an apple on the flag instead of a leaf.  The rotation of the Earth: In Canada there is a very tall windmill. That is how the Earth rotates and makes the night and day. If that wasn't rotating the Earth would just float around in space, without changing the day and night. It rotates the same way the Earth does.  The reason Canada is cold: Reffering to the windmill above: The citizens of Canada decided that they would take the coldness. They like hockey, and they don't mind the frigid cold. They say that since they already have to rotate the Earth, the might as well have it be cold at the same time.  Well, these are just some of the truths of Canada. I thought it was amusing and that you guys might want to read it. It's pretty much all paraphrased, so I may have left a few parts out. Thank you for your time. Your business at my Blog is much appreciated.
