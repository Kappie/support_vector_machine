WellI was always said a "sensible", "rational", "non risky" guy who would be one of the last person in the world who would dare to utter the golden word of passion, which is perceived as by many as a irrational feeling.   Coming to our main topic whether i am passionate, its a tough thing to say. I have never thought about it. I dropped a crush in Engineering college because i felt that it would affect my career ( Still don't know howit0 would have affected my career).. So "samoj" seems lika a insensitive non passinate moron.   But if I stop for a moment and thinkwhether I am a non passionate moron as many think or Am I a more complete human being with emotions like passion and sensitiveness. Well I think,I am a bit of passionate guy, though I have never noticed, I have spend a lot of time on seemingly trivial things ( by my rational part of mind) , spending a lot of energy trying to do things just because it gave a lot of satisfaction and completeness.   Then do we need passion in life ( sounds like crappy "MBA" stuff rite!!! sorry boss, u have come to this god damn blog). A "rational" mind's analysis of passion is something wekeeps your adrenaline pumping, which gives you energy even though youare physically and mentally sapped of the work.
