When you think about someone sick as hell you think about them in bed like arhghhh :S kinda like M at his birthday party except he wasn't sick he was just drunk and we wasn't in bed he was in the mud. ANYWAYS me and kayla aren't sick in bed, we're both on MSN laughing about CHING CHONG and YO STAKE! IM blasting music and that sneaky beef is eating 7 krispy kremes and a whole pepperoni. Id probably be doing the same but my taste buds have been eliminated , Or something. We just stay on here and laugh all day while those poor suckers at school are struggling over the English exam and hamming theyre way through the rest of the school day. On another note, our friends in LaSalle Catholic are probably doing the same, AKA SNAKE i hope you're getting scratched up in gym class and balls whipped at ur gimped arm by the black men. This just in, Scurvey rocks. That's right, I said it.   And another thing, i just got a picture of my newly married aunt and uncle as a christmas card type thing ... can't they waste their money on something a bit more hilarious?  WHAT YOU SAY :O Ohhh yeah , that CEAL D crack head finally e-mailed me an appology for mailing me all that bullshit, the last letter was even about her friend getting an abortion. Don't you feel smart!
