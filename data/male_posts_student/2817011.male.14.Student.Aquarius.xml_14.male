For it seems that they are not free at all, prisoners being abused and most importantly a man imprisoned for the wrong reasons. Camilo Mejia Castillo was put in jail because he refused to return to Iraq to continue with the war. I read an article about it and got a little quote from it. . . "He realized that the war was based on lies about weapons of mass destruction and ties with Al Qaeda, and that the subsequent claims of saving Iraqis from a brutal dictator were a cover up for the real aim of this war: controlling the country's oil and other resources, and gaining a permanent military foothold in a strategic part of the world. He decided he could not, in good conscience, continue to participate in an 'immoral, oil-driven war'." Now, that surely has opened my eyes greatly to much of the war. Also, I signed a petition to help the women of Iraq, hopefully that petition will work out. I've gotten, also, an interest in an anti-war group called Code Pink. Truly, it is a women's organization against the war, but of course all genders are welcomed. My twin even had a pin supporting the group and I feel it to be my time to do more about the war other than despise it in my mind and my mind alone.
