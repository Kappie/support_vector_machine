I still like to go back there once and awile to lock some threads, warn some members, you now, like I'm a control freak, except I wouldn't call it that. I'm packing my bags tonight. I printed of a PHP Tutorial that I can read on the drive down. Too bad I didn't have a laptop, or I would work on some codes and my website. Well, I am taking some movies, and my PS2 down. Maybe that can help me get through the two weeks. I am going to miss my dog and rabbit. I will post a pic of them this week. Maybe Wednesday, possibly, if I can find 5 minutes to take a picture, upload it, copy the URL, and post it here. I'll do that.  ยง33 ยฅ@, Mike
