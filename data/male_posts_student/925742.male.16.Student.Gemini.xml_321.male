Looks like I will have to do those transfers Sunday (like I said in my last post, heh).  On another note, I wish I could know what people were thinking, if they're lying to me, or putting on a mask just for me.  If I hang with you, can't you be yourself?    All my problems, my laziness, my anger, my paranoias, you all get it here, I'm not lying about anything.  I may omit some details or cover some stuff to protect certain parties, though.  Going into more detail into my life, I made peace with my mother, who stopped chatting and doing other bullshit.  She told me that she would never leave her family, and that meant a lot to me.  I'm not so paranoid or afraid now, and I feel much closer to her.  Moving on, yesterday was 3 weeks.  :)  I'm gonna go back to bed, maybe watch a little Mad TV/SNL.  G'night
