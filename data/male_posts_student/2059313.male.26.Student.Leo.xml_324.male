And today I was able to "feel" or observe what kind of negative engery I had been filled with until that point.    I met with a good friend of mine whom I hadn't seen in a couple months, our schedules just never seemed to work out.  She was meeting with some people for a few mintues (some I knew and some I didn't) and invited me along.  When I got there and was sitting in their company, I felt really rediculous and out of place.  I could feel somehow that these energies (mine and theirs) were not in cooperation with each other.  Have I grown that much?  I don't feel like it.  But I do feel that I've changed to a degree that I'm very happy about... and these people that used to be "friends" of mine, well, I don't miss them (except the one I wanted to see in the first place).  I don't know.  Parts of me sometimes think back to the "good old days" and miss them... but the more I think about it... my memories only fill in certain people in them any more.  Do I need to fill in the blanks? No. Do I want to?  Nah.  Thank God for the positive and faithful people and friends in my life.
