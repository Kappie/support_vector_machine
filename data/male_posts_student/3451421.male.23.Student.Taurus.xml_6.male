Of course in your IRC’s you are not going to always know who you are talking to but possible to get a sense of that person based on what IRC they are in and what they are saying. This is harder on a MUD or MOO. The communication on these sites is based on a fantasy world created by the players themselves. That means that the peole stop bieng themselves and begin a character. This charater is called an “avatar”. This avatar is a person’s character which has many of the qualities that we understand such as gender, age, and race. The problem is that in this fantasy world, that is what it is , fantasy. There is no way to tell who the individual is, were they are from , or their personality. MOO’s are a great place for individuals to become lost because they can manipulate the envirnment around the MOO. This manipulation allows them to create a place or object within the MOO, that can be manipulatee by the other players. Again, this is a fantay world so that it is impossible to tell what or who the person is or what they like. 2.	An IRC is an internet relay chat. It consists of many sperate networks of IRC servers. Once you are connected to an IRC server, you can join channels to direct what it is you want to discuss. Conversations can be public or private and that depends on who you want to see the document, one person or lots of people. 3.	MUD’s stand for multiple user dialogs. These MUD’s are used for people that want to play almost a sort of role playing. People create characters and then are able to create envirnments through the site. A major difference is that people can work on these sites without shutting them down (unlike IRC”S) to create thes envirnments. 4.	The first new paradigm shift that is discussed is the shift from print to computerization. This brings up a durability issue on the time a document will last in cyberspace. An interesting side note is that Stephen King has recently published an on-line book. 5.	The purpose of examining on-line communication is to sese if there is a new way of communication emerging, and how this will effect us. An example of this would be the relatively new idea of “netiquette” that emerged in the late 80’s. 6.	A reader is an importatn prt of the chatroom because they decide what is going on. An author may write something, and intend it to be interpreted in a certain way. This interpretation is importatn because it will decide aht you have said.
