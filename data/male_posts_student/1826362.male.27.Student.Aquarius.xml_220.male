Every time I see one (or at least a good looking one), I get all goofy, and I want to roll around on the ground with him and let him lick my face.  today, at the  urlLink bookstore  this giant golden retriever came into the store and, surprise, immediately found the bowl of doggie treats we keep on the counter.  he jumped up and put his big paws on the counter and sniffed at them till his (aweful) person gave him one.  then later he jumped up and put his paws on the counter and i let him lick my hands.  He looked like a really happy dog, and when he wagged his tail, it went thump thump thump against anything within reach.   his name was rusty.
