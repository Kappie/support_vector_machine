Shane the other kid in the group isnt doing jack shit FUCK HIM. But I was cutting the box to make our "pyramid" at Peden's house and shes as holding the box and then the box cutter like slipped or I followed through too much and i cut her thumb. LMAO I was like all shocked at first but then we both started laughing real hard although she was bleeding like fuck. And so then her mom was like STAY AWAY FROM THE BOX CUTTER! Then later it fell when we werent using it and I caught it between my ankles and the blade was out but it didn't cut me. I'm SMOOTH.  So today was Ballard FUCKING Idol. The stupidest idea ever, just for some people who think they can sing to sing and embarrass themselves in front of the whole school. Kind of like American Idol eh? But there was really only one good singer. There was a horrible ass rapper, a guy who cold sing but chose some song from a play so all of the niggers decided to boo him because the cant comprehend the words, some girl who had to read her lyrics, and a couple of other people who dont deserve mention. And of course there was some FAGGOT who decided to act like William FUCKING Hong and he wasnt funny although I was the only one who booed, everyone else laughed, stupid fucks. I guess it was worth missing class for although I was in health and we probably would have been in the gym so scratch that. We had free time in English which was fun because we talked about this burn out annoying ass whore who had ISAP today so she wasnt there to annoy us and take all of our cards. And this one kid kept being really homosexual and annoying as he always is.   And finally the US beat Mexico today 1-0 with a goal on the Last play of the game, HOLLER. But Landon Donovan cant finish and he should die.
