It upsets me and I believe it to be idol worship(Pledging my allegiance to a flag) "I pledge allegiance to the United States of America and the ideals for which it was founded upon, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."  Also the Christian flag... "I pledge allegiance to Christ, my Saviour, and His kingdom, Who, through His crucifixion and ressurrection, provided life and liberty for all who believe."  Another thing that irritates me is people's obsession with proper observance and respect to A FLAG!  ...Meanwhile, the Holy Bible is under the dirty laundry...maybe.  Also, people stand for the national anthem but no one stands for Scripture reading.  Irritating...
