Well 1st off, 1st period was pretty gay to max, muy abburiddo...thnx robbia!!!u saved my life!!!..haha. Then 2nd period was pretty lame, we watched a movie that i almost fell asleep in, but the movie was ok. 3rd period was chill to the max, cuz all we did was jus chill, eat, and play cardz. 4th period we jus absolutely nothin, well i found out that i secured my A, so im happy. Well lookz like im not gonna go to the 1st part of the tourney on friday cuz i have finalz on friday and the scva volleyball committee is lame to the max cuz they dont care about us. So im screwed, guess we jus have to kick ass the 2nd day cuz i think that we're either gonna get 3rd(if we're lucky) or 4th. I can't wait til the summer time...:)...payce outside.
