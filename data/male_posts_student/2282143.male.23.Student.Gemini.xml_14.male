I mean, the stuff like community showers you can do without (although beer, lawnchairs, and swimsuits always made it alot more fun!), but I went to bed at 11 last night...  Thats just kinda sad.  One thing that I really miss is even at 3 in the morning, there is always someone up, hanging out, drunk, doing something stupid, or (yes, some of us actually did this) studying.  I tried to get some homework done last night, and it didnt happen.  Lack of being able to walk away for a half an hour and play videogames with Steve.  Just wait till I come down in December... I will beat you yet in SNK vs Capcom...  Also I wonder if the pledges have attempted a takeover yet.  I still remember TJ climbing down the tree using Whit's safety ladder that was way too short.  Those were the days...
