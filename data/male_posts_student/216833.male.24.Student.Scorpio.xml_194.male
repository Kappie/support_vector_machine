I have to get up at 6:45am tomorrow and work at the rescue center for 6 hours. This is such the coolest job I have ever had. I can actually say that I am helping something. I was going to burn some CDs but I will just sit here. I am full of those kinda things. I was gonna..........fill in the blank. I need to take care of my head, if you know what I mean. One way or another. ;)   current mood:  hungry current music: Cub Country - St. Louis
