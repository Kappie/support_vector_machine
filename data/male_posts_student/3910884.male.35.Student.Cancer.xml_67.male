But what happens when even the basic necessities needed for education are unavailable? What happens when resources are so limited that rarely do children have the opportunity to attend school?  In the Philippines, poverty plays a major role in the opportunity for students to attend school. Those families who can afford to spend the PHP 15,000 or so pesos to send their children to school (public or private) will do so. However, many families can not. And because of this, many children grow up with limited opportunities of breaking the chains of poverty that restrict them, forcing them to repeat the same circle of poverty, generation after generation after generation.  In the Lord of the Rings,  J.R. Tolkien has a line...  One ring to rule them, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them, And in the darkness, bind them.  One could think of the One Ring as poverty when applied to each verse...
