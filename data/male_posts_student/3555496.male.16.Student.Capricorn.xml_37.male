I had to readjust my hat cus it flew off my head when we had to run laps today. CRAZY MESS! I also have this Cookies and Punh line in my head. Mr. Jones and Mr. Wiener thought it would be pretty clever to make us say PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH. COOKIES AND. PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH. COOKIES AND COOKIES AND. PUNCH PUNCH etc. to help us count back and forth through the 4/4 and 3/8 measures. I hate to admit it, but it does. I don't even know why I give Mr. Tienor so much heat; he's actually a pretty cool guy. Jones on the other hand... I don't know about him. He's like a white dude trapped inside a big fat black guy's body. He talks too much and I wanna fall asleep when he's bitching about things. He makes us run laps when we fuck up on the field (parking lot) or during rehearsal, but I think if he ran our laps for us, since it's a hellava lot, I'm sure he'd lose some weight. Who knows, maybe he'd be less bitchy.    Man I drove home for lunch and to my dismay we didn't have anything to eat... or so I thought. I checked the fridge in the garage and it was stocked with pizza and icecream: two of the things they tell us not to eat before we march. So of course I ate them, with pride. I also chugged down a DP instead of drinking water, like I'm s'posed to.    There's not much to my summer anymore now that stupid band has taken over. One more week. That's all I have to take for now. I watched Cabin Fever when I got home. It was pretty stupid, with one of those endings like from 28 Days Later; it was gay and made no sense. But it made me wish I could get some disease from the sun, to make my skin like  urlLink this  or  urlLink this.  That way I wouldn't have to march like all the other weenies.
