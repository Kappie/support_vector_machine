I'm an excelent musician and I'm fucking brilliant. If I'm not saying something profound I'm saying something hilarious (or at least entertaining). I cook like a motherfucker. So, why don't I have a girlfriend? Don't tell me it's because of a lack of modesty, 'cause I don't say all that stuff often (of course it's true though). I saw a lot of couples in NYC and it pissed me off. There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to find a girlfriend. Is Glen Mills cursed or something? Do I just need to start  trying  (because I really don't want to)? It's not like I have rediculously high standards or anything; I'm just looking for someone with a female reproductive system who's close to being my intellectual equal (in either direction). It shouldn't be that hard to find a girl who's a bit unconventional, who can balance the scale for me by bringing in some color and variety-- someone who's unpredictable, fun, openminded, and knows how to appreciate things the way I do. Is it because I only want something serious that I can't find anyone, or is it that I just hate teenagers? I've got a handfull in consideration, one seems smart enough and is damn good looking but I'm not sure about the personality, another's got all three (and then some) but probably wouldn't even consider giving me the time of day, and the other's are just eye candy. I have to say, this area has a horrible selection of women. And the ones I like all go for my opposites while the girls I'm repulsed by (or at the very least, afraid of/not interested in) seem to flock to me. Now, I was not designed with the most modern interpretation of "good looks" in mind. I honestly don't think I'm a bad looking guy, but I'd say my looks are more  classic  good looks, not this new pretty boy shit. I happen to look like a man, an intense Italian man, with angular features and a body shape that makes one able to tell my gender, not like some walking clitoris like Orlando Bloom or one of those nancies. Just so happens that what nature decided should be attractive to women isn't attractive anymore, at least not to the ones I'm interested in. Instead they like the opposite; small, scrawny guys they can push around, with little or no muscle definition, long hair, and girlish/boyish faces. They don't want a man who's going to be good with kids, be a good provider, be good in the sack, or interesting to talk to, they want "cute" guys to cuddle with, snuggle and coo, and not share a single fucking shred of intelligent conversation. They want soneone whose gonna be a total pussy and over-dramatize everything. What a deep fucking relationship that is. I need to get started on my fiction blog. Hopefully work wont be busy tomorrow. NP: Pode's Mix. Call and Response-  Nightflight  Stevie Wonder - Boogie On Reggae Woman  Snoop and Dre - Nothin' But A "G" Thang  all the Modest Mouse that Pode sent me.
