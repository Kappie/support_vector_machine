    
       I've decided to take Alexander Dietz Online offline for a number of reasons, including the lack of original entertainment, maintenance that will become impossible during the busy new school year, and plain old laziness. The added "features" will be available on The Al Blog, using the Alexander Dietz Online page to transport multimedia and such. As you may have noticed, the URL for Alexander Dietz Online now leads you to The Al Blog, so continue to use it instead of rikou.blogspot.com. Stay tuned for updates every Sunday.
