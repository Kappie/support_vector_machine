Sadly, her parents are deeply suspicious of anyone beyond set perameters (namely, male and sixteen years), so I have practically no permission to go and steal her away. Apparently, as a 16-year male, I shall kidnap, rape, brutally murder, and quarter her and bury the spare parts beneath an apple tree. That is what they feel.  Thus, I shall be visiting Amber at work tomorrow, methinks. And then she can steal me away if she wishes, because it would be a most egregious error to introduce myself to her parents (until  that  point in our plans is realized. Bwahaha).  Today was made up of absolutely nothing. I destroyed my bunk bed and kept the futon as my new sleeping mattress. Perhaps I will be repainting it in earth tones. I also reorganized a whole lot of my room, which was utterly pointless and, thusly, without point. If that makes any sense.  Amber, don't leave so soon. We shall be keeping contact until you are 18 and free once again. Then we can go to a college together and be rebellious and never return home.  Cheers.
