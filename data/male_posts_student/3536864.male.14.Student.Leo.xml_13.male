I'm paintballing tomorrow at a stand of trees and a small field. It should be fun as long as i don't run out of C02. It's going to be awesome! Get to test out my new paintball gun....and light up tim...hehe, oh yes, i'm coming for you. Unless we're on the same team in which case we'll have to co-operate. It's great that it doesn't get dark until nine o'clock.  You can go play something outside until it gets dark, then you can come inside, eat dinner, take a shower or whatever, and it's already time to go to sleep! Or you can be nocturnal and stay up till dawn and sleep all day.  I know a few people like that. Little one calls, time to go! Chaio!
