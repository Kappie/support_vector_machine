Everyone uses their blog for a different reason. Mine is a form of a diary that tells people what I am thinking, perhaps sometimes too bluntly. At the risk of sounding nasty, and I really don't mean to be here, this is a comment that can't really be taken the way I mean it; perhaps in that situation it would have been better for Dave to have kept to his non-criticism of other peoples' writings. I actually find it mildly offensive to read as I know my blog is sometimes depressed and a little angst-ridden, but I take pride in the fact I am unabashed  (in general) in telling people how I feel. I will hide names from time to time but even in that I have the ability to be so unsubtle it's obvious, which is actually deliberate. OK, this shouldn't be a rant, and in fact I don't intend it to be, I like Dave and I understand his comment. However I think it's a bit short-sighted. I read about 10 blogs in total, and up to 20 from time to time, and none are the same in usage.  Love, Jon Roskilly
