[not a cause for celebration]... i mean... it's like half the time i don't even know what i did just like a week ago... this life... we have not really been attending to time... not fixing our attention to time... though we may plan but did you plan for time to pass so fast?... life can be a good thing... but then.. time is one thing that mankind can never ever stop or freeze... time is one that is second to death... one that slowly picks the life out of our body... time can peel our flesh and reveal an old self.. time would slowly or depending to situation pick your strength off... extracting your soul... do we have time to think about all this.. i don't think so right?... well i have... can we really slow time?..we can... if we have anticipated this... i believe we would be about to save or motality... or.. can we? see this year is coming to an end.. and.. well this is the last year for grace to be in MI.. so how in the world can i get her no. pluck up the courage and waiting for the chance to ask her.. all in like two months time?... that's y... haiz... time is short.. damn... not like games where you can enter cheats for unlimited time... haiz...
