Anyway, so far, so good.....I'm going to see a movie today........Either Minority Report or something else.....What kind of a name is Minority Report?  What 2-bit psycho names a movie Minority Report?  Probably the same guy who gave me a blog, as if anyone surfing the net is going to land here...   What happened to the shadow government?  They sound like something from Lord of the Rings.  I heard one thing about them, then they went away....Either I don't know enough, or they're all still stuck in their bunkers.  I think my uncle is one of them, I haven't seen him for months.    Dirty bombs........What the hell?  Strap some plutonium to a bomb and have it infect people.......Who needs plutonium?  Just put a crapload of bugspray in a microwave and run like hell.........I hope no terrorists get any idea from that, I'll never forgive myself.......Or if someone from the government reads this, they'll sick the shadow government on me.......     [7:43 PM]  After the movie:          Well, it wasn't Minority Report.  We got there too late.  We saw The Sum of All Fears, and Tom Clancy has never gone lower.  The one element that ruined it: When Russia was about to fire their nuclear arsenal on us, the camera angle was low, and when it showed the missile silo rising-up, the silos looked like two steel boners.....  Dear God, what happened to Tom Clancy?  AJ and I weren't the only ones to notice it either...  Numerous other people laughed, too.  Still, it was a good movie.  I can't complain, therefore, I have to complain.  Morgan Freeman has played the smart guy to the headstrong main character (Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, etc.) with the girlfriend (Gwenyth Paltrow, Bridget Moynahan, etc.) in almost every movie I've seen him in. (anyone see Seven?) He always lives, even if the main character dies or goes to jail......  I can't believe it, but it finally happened.............He finally died.......I didn't think it could happen, but it did.  He's dead.  Maniacs couldn't stop him, bullets couldn't stop him, but a nuclear blast stopped him cold.  About friggin'  time.  You should see this movie.  You won't regret it.  Just see it with someone funny.    AJ wants to write something, it's good..... I hope.  This guy knows how to write.........Probably...   A Day in the Life   My eyes seemed as if they where cemented together, but they relented and opened. I sat up being careful not to hit the ceiling. I pulled the sheets away from my body. I was still wearing my swim trunks from the day before. The house boat was empty exept for the 12 twelve year old in his swim trunks and hazel hair. I opened the sliding wooden door into the hall. It is ladened with artificial wood and candels. I walk into the kitchen and take a coke out of the double doored fridge. It slams closed and the vapor swirls up and disapears. I walk to the sliding door and open it. Outside is a large jagged red clifface. The beach below as well is red. Blood red. Then I remember the dream. I heard screaming. I was falling. When I hit the ground a building fell on me. The reality came back to me and I walked to the second floor of the boat. I looked out onto the glassy water. Only then did I realize this was the calm before the battle. Nothing moved. I lifted the coke to my mouth and drank. I the feeling of drowning in my own blood. Someone was dying and more were to come.    End of AJ   I told you that was gonna be good.......  If you don't like it, you better take a long, hard look at your life.    I'm changing around my templates, so if one of these is good or really sucks, email me at jnickgould@aol.com   For now, just forget I said anything....It'll be better that way   Go america........Tom Clancy needs his job......
