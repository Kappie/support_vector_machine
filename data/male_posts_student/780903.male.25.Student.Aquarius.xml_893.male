I think this pretty much says it all about these big law firms:   I have become a junkie of that gourmet milk they sell in Citarella... It's a whopping $4.99 for a quart. But it is liquid heaven.   This, my friends, is why people never leave law firms. The lifestyle sucks, but you get used to that [] expensive milk that tastes like a milkshake. Damn these golden handcuffs! The brackets in the second paragraph are replacing a bad word.  Lawyers are allowed to use bad words that law students aren't.
