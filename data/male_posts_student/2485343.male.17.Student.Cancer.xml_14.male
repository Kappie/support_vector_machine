I cant stop thinking with my heart when it comes to things like love and relationships. I am reading a book. Three to be exact. There is a passage in one of them that says, 'you can always find the one in the crowd that can fulfill your needs, but you will never be able to pick out the one that will be perfect for you.'  Maybe I should move on. It is hard for me to sit here and think of a girl that I liked so much for me only to think her away. Maybe in live you are only allowed one chance at love. If you mess up, that's it for you. I have messed up once, before her. If that was my chance, it wasn't my fault. She was the one who led me on consistently and played with my heart as it were an egg. One false move and its over for the young boys heart. 'I have his whole world in my hands' she sang as she stomped on it. Lindsey Alexander broke my heart, Anna also broke it. I cant trust anybody anymore.  And the plaster dented from your fist in the hall where you had your first kiss reminds you that the memories will fade.
