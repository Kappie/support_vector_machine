I took West College Avenue out of town and drove to parts of State College I hardly knew existed. I couldn’t see much; the night was a tad too dark, the road a tad too narrow, the driver a tad too nervous. But I enjoyed it. A few bad moments, when the windshield fogged over from the outside, and I kept desperately wiping it from the inside. And when I ran through a red light, because...Um no excuses. I just didn’t see the light turn.  The drive lasted an hour. A very enjoyable hour. I think I will be driving a lot more.  A brief interlude.   A word from our sponsors Messrs Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr:     The long and winding road That leads to your door Will never disappear I’ve seen that road before It always leads me her Lead me to you door  The wild and windy night That the rain washed away Has left a pool of tears Crying for the day Why leave me standing here Let me know the way  Many times I’ve been alone And many times I’ve cried Any way you’ll never know The many ways I’ve tried  But still they lead me back To the long winding road You left me standing here A long long time ago Don’t leave me waiting here Lead me to your door  But still they lead me back To the long winding road You left me standing here A long long time ago Don’t leave me waiting here Lead me to your door Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah     I rather like that song.  Well we moved. Partially. I think I will have to junk most of the furniture. I find that I will actually miss Parkway Plaza, and I wonder why?   Time and distance. Time and distance, is the answer, I suppose. Time is not on my side, and distance has decided to be a bastard too.   What I need is a TARDIS. I'd rather fight Daleks, Icemen and the Master, than continue to do this.  Since this post has pretty much gone the way of the previous one, I will ramble on a bit.   I am twenty-five. I might have mentioned that fact before, but do try to remember it this time, gentle reader. I am twenty-five and I wonder whether the best years of my life are behind me, and all that lies ahead is the long slippery slide into adulthood? A future barren of fun and excitement? Where boredom rules and mundanity prances in the prairies of normalcy.   That scares me.   A lot.   I did once say that the perfect age was my current age, whatever it is at that time. I certainly hope so. But I begin to doubt it.  Incidentally Doom3 released. To the instruments of death and mayhem people.  The cat provides backup.
