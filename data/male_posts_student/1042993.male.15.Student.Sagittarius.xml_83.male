I must say, I was really nervous at first and I even cancelled it on the second day!  But, with confidence, I am back.  The new domain is justinwallace.org and it's up now with a little bit more information (but not much).  I'm still working on a few designs.  I got frames to work though...  Seems that my frames dilemma was actually a Geocities problem after all.  Worked on my server fine.   On another note, my most recent obsession is  urlLink Monk .  USA is rolling out with a brand new season and I've been watching the premier all-day-long.  In fact, I'm watching it right now at it's....let's see... 12:30 AM.  Happy Saturday everybody, I'm going to finish watching this epsiode of Monk and I'm going to bed!  G'night!
