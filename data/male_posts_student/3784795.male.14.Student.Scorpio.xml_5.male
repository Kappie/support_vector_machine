Isn't it funny how the best movies are based on books?   Anyways. I, Robot looked like it would involve a large portion of robot-slaying action sequences, but it did not in fact. It was mostly a mystery "Howdowepreventthisimpendingdisasterandwhatexactlywillitbe", and then when fighting and action sequences did commence, they were spectacular. The filming was phenomenal, with intorduction of some shots that I had never really seen before. They were mostly gyrating shots that spun around an invisible sphere around Will Smith while he shot robots. They used it only about three or four times, so it was not overused, but it really created an incredible effect.   Another great part of the filming is when the house is being demolished. Here is a great use of that dramatic camera-shake effect that is used all to commonly in movies. The difference was, you cot the full impact while still seeing what was actually going on.   Another edge this had over action movies was that there were no parts where anybody did something humanly impossible, except for one or two where there was a very good excuse.   The plotline was one that seems like it had been done too much before but when I thought about it, the Matrix and Star Wars Episode II were the only similar ones I have seen.   I'm not one to really really understand a movie unless I see it about three times, so the whole end sequence didn't make a lot of sense to me...I can't think about big concepts as those. But I'm sure it was good.   In review, this was the  most kickass movie I have seen in a  long  time .   See it. Now. No seriously. Go. The next one starts in 25 minutes.
