I'm sorry that I don't do it more often, but I've been here and there so much that in the past three weeks I've probably only been somewhere with access for a week or so. I'll try to update you guys on everything, and then maybe I can keep some sort of regular schedule for this thing. Like I keep saying, once school starts back up, I promise to post more often. I promise...really...no, seriously...no, SERIOUSLY! You've gotta believe me! Oh well...I don't care if you believe me or not!  Well, stuff has gone pretty nuts. I volunteered at "R.A. Camp", which is basically a church-run Boy Scouts...and I'm not exactly the nature type if you don't gather from my posting. But, anyway, it was a lot of fun. Got to teach a Bible lesson, which was pretty cool. On the last day, I had a really short lesson and at the end, instead of just leaving like they usually did, a group of about 6 kids just started asking me questions? The lesson had a lot to deal with Heaven, so I can understand how that got their minds to running. Their questions were actually very well thought out, and I had fun having this sort of little discussion time with them. I'm not exactly a "Biblical Scholar" but I know a lot of it, so I had most of the answers, although I kept stressing that most of the answers were just 'my opinion or my thoughts' and that they should talk to their pastor and parents about such stuff. Good kids, though...at least most of them. Some of them were left behind, but we didn't mind (I don't think their parents did either).  Well, after that, I had a one day rest at my house before I went to Youth Camp, and a lot of things happened there. I've made huge leaps in my faith and some major changes in the way I'm living my life, although most of those won't show up in this blog, since they're more private. But one thing I'm going to make an effort to do is to reach out to people more and to be more friendly, because that's the only way things can get better. If we're always looking to the inside, what good does that do? I've also started reading my Bible a lot more, and I find that I understand it a lot more and it makes a lot more sense. Anyone who want to read the Bible but has trouble understanding it should check out "The Message" translation. Its a complete Old/New Testament Bible written in modern day vernacular (every day talk). Very cool.  Well, either way, I guess I can't post ALL good news. I also have to report the bad. Beautiful and I have broken up. The whole thing just really wasn't working out, but we've talked and I'm happy to say that we're still going to be good friends. There's really no reason to NOT be friends, since nothing *big* happened. Also, I'm happy to say that I've passed on my 'blog-bug' to Beautiful. You can now see HER thoughts on life at this address.  urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/emo2/s_damico/knicknack/  I will continue to refer to her as Beautiful, because our breaking up doesn't change that.  Well, the family reunion was...interesting. Actually, it was just boring. I spent most of it reading in my Bible or listening to tunes on what I believe is one of the single greatest inventions of mankind, the portable CD player with headphones. I know this kind of contradicts the whole "reach out to people" thing I've got going, and that's something I'm going to have to work on. I'll post how that works out.  Well, no band stuff to report on, although Warlock is hard at work on coming up with parts for two songs he's written, mine, and a cover for dc Talk's 'Jesus Freak'. We, as a band, always agreed that we would NEVER do covers, but we decided that the song has just been too important in our musical lives. It was, literally, the first Christian rock song I ever heard and when I got the entire album, I must have listened to it...20 times? Easy. I would suggest to ANYONE, Christian or not, to check it out...although it'll mean a lot more if you're a Christian. I can still listen to the entire CD through and not get bored or skip a song. Especially Jesus Freak, since it talks about martyrs and living in the faith. The song is actually about John the Baptist, although most people don't know it.  Well, I've recently gotten some new CDs, so I think my next post will be CD reviews. That's always fun. I'll listen through them once, then listen to them again as I write the reviews. Also, I saw The Bourne Supremacy yesterday, and its awesome! Very sweet, but it helps if you saw the first one, The Bourne Identity.
