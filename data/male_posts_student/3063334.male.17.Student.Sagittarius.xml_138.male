I know that however hired him would have a customer in me for sure!  Good luck Tom and Skyview in the ISEF comp!  By the way, Catcher in the Rye isn't for everyone, if you don't like it from the start, you might want to switch because it doesn't change much.  However, some people REALLY identify with the desperate feeling of not quite fitting in with the world.  The book didn't grab me like Gatsby did, which I really enjoyed, but As I Lay Dying needs some love too, so far it's me and Kailie V and I'd like some people to share with, so think about it.  Love Rob
