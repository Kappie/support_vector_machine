Just too shy, (just too shy, shy girl),  Aww babe, you’re just too shy (just too shy, shy girl).   Sittin there all by youreself,  talking to nobody (talking to nobody )  your head is bowed,  your eyes look to the ground,  I want to you know you baby.   cause you’re just too shy, (just too shy, shy girl)...  Just too shy, (just too shy, shy girl),  Aww babe, you’re just too shy (just too shy, shy girl).   See you laughin with your friends,  But they do all the talking.  Won’t you come and walk with me awhile,  I want to you know you better   cause you’re just too shy, (just too shy, shy girl)...  Just too shy, (just too shy, shy girl),  Aww babe, you’re just too shy (just too shy, shy girl).
