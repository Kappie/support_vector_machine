As I, Thomas who am called doubting, sat talking to Jesus, in his last days before my ressurection, He explained to me the ways to the Kingdom of the Father. He said unto me "When man can make two-and-two into three and of those three combine them as one, then he shall find passage into the kingdom of the father." Being an doubting man, I questioned him saying "But Lord, Why do not the rituals of the priest reflect this?" The Lord answered me, "Oh ye of little knowledge!  You look to the sky for the father, and ritual for his voice!  Surely man is not buried in the ground because God is closer to the ground, nor do the birds fly in the sky to be closer to God.  For if two-and-two were made into the three-and-one on Earth, then why would man need to look for God?"  At this moment the words of the Savior became clear to me and I understood, and the way to the place where the Saints live became clear to me if only for a second.   This isn't exactly what came to me.  Only the first "quote" of "Jesus" came to me like that, and I thought of elaborating it a bit, to resemble a passage from  The Gospel of Thomas .  It makes me wonder if that Gospel really was quoting Jesus.
