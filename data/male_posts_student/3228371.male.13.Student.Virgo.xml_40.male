What's a thunderstorm gonna do to me?! The most that'll happen will probably be me getting a cold! Rain = water! Water can't hurt me! I'll just wear a hat and bring a windbreaker! Jeez! Wtf?! Vivo, Kryss, Candace, and Mark already left and they're on the way there. Martin's gonna go soon, and I'm supposed to drive Nima and Alice. If I can't go, they won't have rides. I don't know if Nima can get his parents to drive him and Alice but yeah. I hate it. Now if Nima and Alice don't have a ride, they won't be able to go either. Fuck it. I wanted to go really badly. "Go on Monday" she says... psht... Monday's Victoria Day! There'll be like tons of people! Today is gonna rain so there won't be as many people!  My mom is so... blah. What's a little rain gonna do to me?! It's not like I'm gonna get struck by lightning! Hello?! Geez... I'm not a kid anymore. Wtf... so POed right now.
