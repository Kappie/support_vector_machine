ABout eight of us are coming out to see you. I have mixed feelings about the crazy hot girl whose been all over me lately.  On the one hand, she's hot and she's all over me.  On the other hand, this is such a sudden change I fear she may be using me for something.  Oh well.  I'm still enjoying the hell out of it. I can't wait to see Camp! Ok, umm, Erin looks nothing like Renee Zwelleger, but it's really funny to imagine her doing those songs.  Deanna was apparently mistaken when she told me Bob Barker was dead; in fact the man who had previously hosted The Price is Right before him passed away.  Soph, it was right before you left, and you gave me a weird look and said, "okay...."  SQ(u)EE!
