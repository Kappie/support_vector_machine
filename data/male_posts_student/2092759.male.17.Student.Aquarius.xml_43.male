Sitting around the band room before graduation was interesting. Wheels, you are a stupid, stupid, loveable bastard. Hometown Buffet is amazing. If anyone ever has a desire to go to dinner randomly, I am always willing to go to Hometown Buffet. 10$ at Hometown = All you can eat. Good times, thanx Sam and Roland. Spent the rest of the weekend just messing around and playing D with the goggle of gamers. Summer is going to be fun, and next years going to be even better.
