I downloaded Super Mario Bros. 3 and played it all day, all the way through. I didn't think I still had it in me but I did; in fact it was the best I'd ever done it. Once I played it through when I was like 12 or 13 and it took 3 days, but I did it within the course of an afternoon. Pretty good considering how many years it's been. It's like those movies where the character gets anmesia... "I think I have to jump here, but I don't know why...[bonk][1-UP falls from sky]...Awesome!" Now if only I could remember the GREs like that.
