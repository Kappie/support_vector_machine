Now, this probably won't interest many, but if you have always wanted a website this is the best place I have seen. It helps you with HTML if you need it. It gives you 15 MB of free space. You can pay to get more, but I have a moderately large site and I have barely used up 2 MB. Anyways, that's all for the site.  First Period: TA; I had to fix other peoples computers some more. People were coming in and out for Star Testing. I really like this class because I really like helping people out.  Second Period: Web-Page Design; do you guys know what game is highly underrated? Ski-Free from the "Best of Entertainment" pack. I played that for about an hour and a half.  Lunch: Not very interesting. Lenny left to go buy soda, but he was gone for so long we figured that he was maimed, eaten or some other near-death, or death experience.  Third Period: Well, this was great. I go in, we do some work. Than do you know what the teacher does? She gives in to the other kids demands and lets them watch Maury on T.V. This is perfect for me. I tell the teacher that this stuff offends me and that I would like to go to the library for the remainder of the period. She has to let me go. So I did. I didn't really get anything accomplished, although that's not why I was supposed to go anyways.  Home: This is why I am excited. It's Friday! Actually, that is really a small portion of it. I want it to be Monday. I think God wants me to start a Christian club on the campus. For anybody who is from Livermore High and wants to start one with me, please contact me anyway you know how. Whether I have someone helping me or not, I am going to do it.  Piano lessons started today. I was incredibly rusty. Oh well, plenty of time to get back up to par. Well guys, I am eating popcorn and it is hard to eat and type at the same time. Talk to you all later.
