Phase One involved sitting around, coming up with the ultimate 90s hardcore triple bill.  After some deliberation, the admittedly somewhat anachronistic triad of the hal al-Shedad, Still Life, and Struggle got the nod.  In retrospect I probably should have gone with Portraits of Past instead of the hal al-Shedad, but it's too late now damn it.  The only background you really need on any of those bands is that Portraits of Past are now the Vue, and the lead singer of Struggle is now in the Locust.  And that none of the groups on the bill are capable of any artistic stance but obnoxiously earnest moral certainty.  Phase Two is when I made a suitably amateurish ballpoint-on-notebook-paper flyer for the fictitious show, indicating that it is to take place on August 5th at a house which, I am told, was Bloomington's house-show central in 1996, and took the flyer to the supermarket, making about seven copies.  Phase Three properly started at around eleven pm when I handed off the first of the flyers to a bunch of teenage hipster types lugging their skateboards through the supermarket.  Their response, astonishingly, was "is this  the  Still Life?"  I would have expected the h.a.s. to have been the band with the most lasting impact; moreover as you now know for certain Struggle has one of the guys from the Locust.  But no.  Still Life.  Kids.  Phase Three will continue momentarily as I put up the remaining flyers downtown as soon as I finish posting this.  Phase Four (provisional) will take place, should I choose to bother, on the day of the show, when I might just go over to where the show is supposed to happen and watch the four people who cared enough to show up get really disappointed.  And yeah, this is probably a really shitty thing to do to people, but a) it's not going to affect enough people to matter; b) it's late and I'm bored; and c) fuck all y'all if you can't take a little joke.
