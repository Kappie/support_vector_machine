Their dick boss comes over and tells them to move the pile two feet to the left, and then leaves to go masturbate. The two neanderthals look at each other with excitement and cry, "Let's Photo!" They take pictures of themselves (and probably post them on a gay porn site) and move the bricks. Then the asshole from RITZ camera comes on and he's all "take pictures and we'll rape you for money blah blah..."  This is the best part though. The boss comes BACK and tells them to MOVE the BRICKS BACK to WHERE they WERE. The idiot workers don't care. They say "LET'S PHOTO! AGAIN!" Assholes. By the way - see you at school tomorrow!
