There's a chess tournament today in Oakland (Pittsburgh, PA, for those not aware of where I am situated) and I really don't want to have to go, especially because of the almost constant uncertainty as to when I will be picked up. I think there should be a law: "Everything must be clear-cut and defined absolutely in the making of a plan involving more than three people."  Okay. One thing I don't get (at the risk of insulting several people who may be reading this, of course): those blogs that are almost totally random. What's the point? Who would want to read some disconnected rambling not related to anything remotely comprehensible? Actually, I might want to be a bit more lenient until my blog gets fixed up... I have some interesting links, format ideas, et cetera.  Wow, that was boring. Anyway, I'm soon off to school. Perchance, something interesting will happen.
