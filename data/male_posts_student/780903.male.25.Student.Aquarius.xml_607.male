From the e-mail:  Proceeds go to: "Kick Start for Kidneys" Finding a Cure For Childhood Kidney Disease  "Kick start for kidneys???"  That sounds awfully painful.  I don't think kicking kids in the kidneys is going to help them much.  Kidneys don't seem like the kind of organ that needs to be "kick-started."  What a poor name choice for a charity, in my humble opinion.
