Maria last night played her first tournament since Wimbledon, a WTT exhibition. The final score was that Maria's team the Newport Beach Breakers beat the Sacramento Capitals 23-16. Maria played 3 matches and won 2 and lost 1. In singles Maria lost 3-5 to Nicole Vaidisova. In doubles Maria teamed up with Nana Miyagi and they beat Anastassia Rodionova and Nicole Vaidisova 5-3 and in mixed doubles Maria teamed up with Ellis Ferreria and they beat Mark Knowles and Rodionova 5-4          Played Football and Badminton today. During my break, we played with some guys who were playing on the field. We won 3-2, I scored 2 goals and Kang Heong scored a goal. A great goal, I might add, dribbled past 1 guy, and got a shot past the keeper at the near post. I scored 2 curling goals from far, and not to forget I hit the shot into the bar once, which denied my hattrick, oh well, time to work much harder. As for the second football session, it was nice, casual playing and relaxing too. Then on to badminton, not much free courts to play on, I guess it was quite a busy day due to it being the last day of the week and everyone wanted to relax. I realised my smashing is getting better and better, hopefully I can reach my best in time to come, but its sure good to play once again.   That's all for now! Will write more tomorrow.
