Basic: come on - hurry up, you're too slow! let's go - when she sits down when i stop walking, i say this so she knows it's time to keep going... go on thru - go thru a door, turn around and watch me sit - duuur.... down - duuurr... stay - must I explain? Go potty - if you can't figure THIS out... come on! Leave it - dammit, I'm not explainin' no more... eh-eh (ny-ket, russian for no) stop whatever you're doing  look at me - dur.   Alerts: Say "jesse" 2 or more times, until Lia jumps on me and brings me to you. knocking - she barks, runs to the door, to me, to door. timer (microwave, oven, etc) - she jumps on me, takes me to the approximate location Alarm - this black dog loves to... paw... me... and whine... 'til I wake up. what?/kak (kak - russian...) - when she jumps on me, i say what or kak (russian for what) so she knows to take me to the sound. fire alarm - she will jump on me, go 'round, and lie down.  Others: take it - pick up object I point to and bring to me. "you wanna go? wanna go out? ya wanna go out?" - makes her hyper, jumps up and down, so she knows we're going outside... good girl/harashowa (russian)   Other alerts: - she, using her own canine brain, pulls at the leash to whichever elevator door is going to open... nifty. - whenever there are homeless people following me, yelling and begging for money, she will turn around while I walk, and then walk faster. - whenever I "clap" my right hand over my mouth, it means - feeding time! - she used to alert me to the phone, but most of the phone calls are for Lauren, so I stopped her on this.  - boxing, when she's hyper I'll pretend to fight her and she goes nuts and jumps on me.
