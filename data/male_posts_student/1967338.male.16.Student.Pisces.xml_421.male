Upon the ringing of the bell, the teacher's will close and lock their doors, and those people who are not in class, will be metaphorically swept into the Auditorium, where they will be yelled and bitched at about the importance of being punctual.  JournalCon is in one week, at my house. Erin, Rachel and Sophia are invited, but due to prudish parents, cannot participate in the sleepover. Food will be provided, however any donations would be appreciated.  Also, Paul: Respect the template. Keep it in your posts. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
