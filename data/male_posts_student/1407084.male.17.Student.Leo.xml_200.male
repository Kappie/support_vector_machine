I know you'll probably pound me into the ground or something for trying to apologize this late, but I just want you to know that I have always felt like our pathetic silent feud is pretty sad and dislogical. Just throwin' that out there, you don't have to reply if you don't want, although I'm sure you'd love to make fun of me some more. Sometimes I enjoy it because you are one of the very few who actually say logical things when writing comments and such. Sorry for having judged you in the past, it's not really my place to judge anyone like that.. I don't plan on doing it again. Have a nice day?
