The song Layla (as well as the album) is considered to be one of the truly great blues rock albums. Duane Allman, a master of the slide guitar, shows why he's so highly regarded, by playing a great solo in this song. Layla as well as most other songs in the album were written at a time when Clapton was deeply in love with George Harrison's wife. Whatever the reason and inspiration behind making music, when genuises like Clapton and Allman are at work, we don't mind at all! Clapton's acoustic version of this song from the Unplugged album is a beautiful piece too.  7)  The Eagles - Life In The Fast Lane   I love The Eagles. Their music is not exactly as profound as some other bands on this list, but this is not the time to draw comparisons. Actually, some might disagree with this statement. After all, how can anybody forget Hotel California? But let us also give them their due for coming up with other equally good (or perhaps even better) quality songs. Take for instance this one: Life in the fast lane from the album Hotel California. The song kicks off tremendously with Joe Walsh's riff. A straight rocker which also officially established Joe in the band. Everybody knows what a great rock voice Don Henley has. Glenn Frey says:  "The song is about the lifestyles of the rich and miserable -- 'We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a God-damn thing.' -- rich as hell, gettin' high, got everything they want, and yet they're living in a spiritual ghetto."   8)  The Eagles - Get Over It   Get Over It is a tremendous rock song from their album Hell Freezes Over, when Don Henley and Glenn Frey got together again and wrote it after a gap of 14 years. Don Henley has said that it's the fastest song, tempo-wise that they ever recorded, and my god, it sure is an out-and-out rocker. Pure energy song, this one, and definitely has an harder edge (as in the sound) to it than any other of their works.  9)  Dire Straits - Telegraph Road   I've felt this a zillion times. If I had to play music, I would play it like Dire Straits did. They might not be a tight bunch of musicians, but what the heck. T-Road was the very first song that introduced me to lengthy rock songs, or progressive rock. T-Road is hardly  progressive , but it's still epical by Straits proportions, clocking just under 15 mins. I appreciate it more for its overall musical and lyrical structure. MK as usual is brilliant on his stratocaster, but Alan Clark, Hal Lindes and Pick Withers too have lots to offer in the keyboards, rhythm and drums section respectively. T-Road has an  urlLink interesting history  behind it, if you are curious to explore more.  10)  Dire Straits - Six Blade Knife   Only one word to describe this song - subtlety. Grab a decent set of earphones and notice the licks, all harmonics. If you are an amateur guitarist, this is a great lesson in harmonics, although I can bet that after you give it a hear, you'll be so much over-awed by the level of guitaring that you'll end up being a frustrated guitarist. MK plays the guitar such that the fundamental frequency of the string is muffled, but the smaller vibrations of the string continue resonating. Lots of multiple bends. Amazing fillers in between the leads. He's just plucking away subconsciously. The fingerpicking, is all about the feel!    urlLink Part III: Songs #11-15
