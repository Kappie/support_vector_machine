I went to the Dentist on Saturday with the inclination that I would only have to endure a filling, but it turned out after all the drilling and sawing (okay a little over exaggerated) that the Dentist would have to proceed with a route canal.  Eeeek! So half an hour later I was looking into a half attacked tooth. And an hour or so later I had my tooth filled with a 5 or 6 temporary tiny cotton balls and some sort of cap (or caveat as my dentist called it) to temporary hold the gap in my tooth until my next hour and a half visit to permanently refill my tooth. By the way is not for another 2 weeks..and the  temporary  cap seems to be breaking apart... that's just great!     Although, as most people would have thought this nightmare to be a painful procedure...It wasn't as bad as I thought.  I was able to enjoy the BBQ Party Darryl and Jamie hosted for their friends, although the help of some not so PG-13 beverages and even ice cream cake (hee!) also helped me through this ordeal.  So kiddies what's the moral of my story... Remember to keep brushing those teeth...and eating those sweets...hahaha!!!
