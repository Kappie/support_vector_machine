As a few of my colleagues already know back in the late 80's I began work on a method of mind controll that would give me the ability to make others conform to my beliefs or the way in which I wanted them to act.  I began my mission on a man named William Clinton aka Bill Clinton (or as I will to refer to him Dixie Crack Clinton.) (I've gotta give Zach De La Rocha props for Dixie Crack Clinton.)  As many of my colleague already knew, the thought process I put into his head was communism.  Unfortunately, my expieriment was in the shitter before it started because my colleagues didn't tell me that Dixie Crack Clinton was already a communist.  With that in the shitter, I decided to give up for a while, and now over a decade later I will try again.  This time Canada will be the victim.
