But thanks to my skillful abilities, i managed to sneak in without having to attend detention. For your info, i've got 2 detentions that i need to attend and i've managed to escape detention 3 times by sneakin into skool. Okay, first thing in the mornin, Mr Sydney Tan made a whole bunch of students run around the track, includin me. Reason: when the music started playin [signal to assemble at track] many people were still walkin slowly and takin their time. So punishment? Run around the track once.Yeah, what a great way to start your first day in skool.      After the "mornin jog", i made my way to class, just to find out the Mrs. Sng [Math tutor] was pissed off. Dunno what's her problem. Many told me that she was pissed cos no one asked her questions bout the math assignment that she gave us. So she thought that we were acting smart or stuff like that. Well, can't blame the class you know. She's like a lion, always shoutin at us. And now, we gotta hand in PERFECT assignments or we'll have to do the assignment again 10 TIMES!!! Waddafuck. But Mrs Sng is a great math tutor, despite her very bad temper. Then i sat for a binomial theorem test which i totally forgot about. And by miracle, i passed, still havent know my marks yet. Or maybe it's becoz Mrs Sng's just great.      During geog elec, Mr. KEFLI [the loser] apparently sent Anirudh out becoz he was mockin him. For your info, Kefli took part in one of the National Day Celebration items, and as usual, he was a joke. Everyone made fun of him as he dance on stage in his baju kurung. Very funny indeed. Well, Kefli's not a proffesional teacher. I've never seen a teacher sent out a student just coz he said, "sir, you dance very nice that day". Not only that, he also sent out another person coz he mentioned the word "dance". Bleah, Kefli's a loser.      After skool, i went for history remedial. Best part, Mrs Laj [the teacher who played the gotchatrick on us] brought some biscuits and the class was muchin away as she conducted her lesson. What a great way to end a long weird day. Honestly though, this is certainly NOT my typical skool day, coz usually, i'll be sleepin in class, coz it's too boring.....
