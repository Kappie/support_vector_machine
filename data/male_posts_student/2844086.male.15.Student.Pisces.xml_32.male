I also had to teach a student's lesson today! I'm a student teacher in the making, I guess you could say. I think it was a pretty good session.  So here's my practice:  Scales  - All were very well. I think I'm trying to play them to fast though, so this week I'm going to play them slowly. Have you tried that lately? Sometimes I find it funny that it's harder to play them slower, because when you play them faster you don't really think about the notes that you play, you just go!  Cadences  - Really strong today! I'm happy with how they are coming. 1st inversion with G Major was good actually.  Hanon  - I tried putting #7 hands together. AHHH! Very Hard! This one might take me a while!  Technic  - First off I've been wondering lately, "Why did James Bastien spell it technic when its technique?" Anyway, "Snowmobiling" is very slow, but it's together. And yes, I practiced my inversions.  Piano  - I almost have Reveille! I just keep messing up going from the A minor to the E Major. SO CLOSE!  "Spinning Song"  - I cannot wait until I get to put hands together on this song. Sometimes the counting throws me, but I really think that I have it!  But today I really missed the Master's Class! (That's a theory class for all of you who don't know.) :) But I can wait until next week.
