(or lack thereof.) yearbook is crazy...just how many people's pictures look exactly (or almost) the same as last year? pat, owen, jen liu, jason koide, basho, adam...p. 76 look-alikes, poor siegel haha. he had even bought contacts so he wouldn't look like him. (he was close to getting fired from his ga job cuz some lady in an oscar meyer weiner hat complained about him.) o well.   this yearbook is much nicer than last year's, which was like they hired elementary school kids to make it. but in the girls' jv bball pictures, it shows amanda, audrey, and lindsay anderson in the EXACT same pose for a baseline jump shot, but it says audrey's trying to shoot, amanda's trying to pass, and lindsay's trying to dunk. huh? then alex in badminton: "alex chang attempts to make a crisp and accurate serve by using his outstanding skills." (the pic was taken during open gym, like the first time he ever played.) and quote of the year (about dating in high school): "it's good. it helps you for future dating."   history. long. lame. lott (aka v.i. lenin): "what form of music was invented in the early 1900s in new orleans?" mike: "country?"   watching the nba finals...go nets! altho tony parker has been schooling jason kidd lately. you kno how malik rose slammed the ball in dikembe mutombo's face? today in the first qtr, stephen jackson swiped it from jason kidd then passed it to tim duncan who MISSED a dunk, then rose got the rebound, went for a dunk and was SWATTED by mutombo. the french commentator was going "ooh la la"...then richard jefferson over kevin willis, my oh my. and speedy claxton's layup to end the 3rd qtr...  that one asian girl in the show fame, like she was wearing some red top on monday night? wow. and the asian dude? wow...his face looks old.  thanx owen, but don't worry about it. if i didn't get a position, i didn't get a position. that's how things go. and o yea, amita has a 90%? just 4 days after she had a 95%? that's why mrs sykes is bs. pish posh to all you who have her next year...which may include me actually  i wanna make the senior slideshow. for some reason, designing things (art and style-related, not like architecture or clothing) interests me. anyone think p.o.d. -- "thinking about forever" and good charlotte -- "the young and the hopeless" would be good?
