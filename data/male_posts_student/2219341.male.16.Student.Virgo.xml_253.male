    
       all night i toss and turn.  i cant stop thinking about you.  every smile torments my dreams.  yet i still adore each smile.  but still you dont see me.  you, like so many others, see right through me like glass.  to you i am nothing more than a friend and i long to be more.  i desire so much more.  i hope for you to see me.  i have to dream that you will smile on me one day.  je t'aime, ma belle.  prenez-moi...s'il vous plait.  bon soir.  dormez bien.
