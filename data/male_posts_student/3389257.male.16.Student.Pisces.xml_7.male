I prefer using my fingers to play bass. Squeet...Your not so nice now u n jo are an item..pretty damn mean infact. so thanks. I'm normally feeling rather cheery. today i feel lonely. it must be my odour. It's one of those things you can't shake. I will be cheerier tomorrow. Maybe I shall be more forgiving of squeet also. for now squeet..the bad books for you.   Bad books for lucy to. I like my women thankyou very much. Bad books for Jo also..he's as mean as squeet....good couple in a way.  bye.exit.
