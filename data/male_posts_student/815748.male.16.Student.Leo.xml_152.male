The problem is, some of my favorite songs are large, so it would take forever to load them.  This one is another one by Spoon, I might fish around with music for a little while.  Arnaud leaves Friday.  I think you know how I feel about this (hint: I'll have my own room again).  New MUN issue, Security Council reform, adding non-permanent and permanent members.  I spoke, used my full minute, and talked pretty fast; I hope that didn't detract from my arguments.  I learned that there is a very low likelihood that Ms. Richardson will change my grade, even though it is low of no fault of mine.  So I'm letting that one go.  I talked to this vegan kid who apparently might have been in my first-grade class at Schecter, that was interesting.  I'm thinking of writing more; we'll see how that goes (if at all).  My English teacher just assigned a paragraph on the purposes and goals of education.  That seems so arbitrary and like suspicious.  Oh, and we watched part of "Scotland, PA" in English today, that was quite entertaining.  And here's a quote from chemistry.  Alex Gollick always has interesting things to say.   "Kelvin is exactly 3." ---Alex Gollick
