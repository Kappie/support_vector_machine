Answer:  You get the newly designed (from the ground up) blog.    No more blogger templates for me.  No sir.  Thanks to some sleepless nights, the fact that I have no girlfriend, my friend Ben Stewart, and my insatiable thirst to be better at something than I already am, I've made a variation on a theme, the basic layout and the information is all still here, it's all just formatted differently.  This is actually the first step in creating a whole website. Phase one - initiate new design into blog!  I'm still working on the actual website, and you'll hear it here, first when it's launched!  Anyway, kick back, grab a cold one (whatever that may be) and let your eyes feast on some candy.
