I'm telling everone that it's my favorite movie and I haven't even seen it yet.  So right now i'm just reading an excerpt from  Glorious Appearing . It's very interesting. But I'm kinda lost you know cause I'm still on book 2!! :) But I think I can figure it out.  So anyway I guess tomorrow I'll post my feelings on the movie.
