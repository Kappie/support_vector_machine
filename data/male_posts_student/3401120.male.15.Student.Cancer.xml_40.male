And then, we stopped seeing each other cuz he got sick of a weird disease, i was sad for a while but i forgot about him later. So when christmas arrived, i was at this party in the neighborhood where i met this kid, michael, we wer eplaying with some other kids who were my neighbors, and well we started playing alone and talking, he was wearing a blue mouthcover like the ones the docs use, so i could only see a half of his face... so i invited him to my house so we could talk and i could see his face... he was... damn he was so fuckin hot, and well we got along very well and we were hangin out like for one month, and one day, he came to my house and we started doing "stuff", and well we both looked at each other and... kissed... then it all became a wild, wild gay sex scene. im not embarrased or ashamed of saying it, after all, this is me and i dont have to say what people wants me to say. so that guy and i started a relationship, boyfriend/boyfriend lol and i can say it was the best time of my life.        12 years: darn, i entered the high skool, and michael too, and we were in the same skool! yeah it was great...one day, at skool, i saw this cute boywho brought me memories, but i didnt knew who it was! so i talked to him and omfg it was HOMER! yea! he and i were so fuckin happy we met again, and somichael met homer and we were the coolest, punkiest and messiest boys of the neighborhood. we acted so gangsta andshit, we the three were really happy by that time, we also went to the mall to steal cd's haha. i rememberone time whenhomer and i went to the stadium, we live rite next toit so we went there and entered it WITHOUT PERMISSION damn wewere like playing this"metal gear solid" game haha, it was so great, we were on the main rooftop, we werejumpin and running there, our objective was torun a full lap to the stadium, we were doin it cooluntil i fucked it all up by throwing a light bulb to the seats, damn we got caught but we made our way out, and we had to deal with the cops. we all had great times when we were together, we smoked, we drinked and a lot of stuff and homer didnt even knew that michael and i had a relationship. it was allnice with the three of usuntil we fucked it all up whenmichael and i decided to make some graffittis at a park and we got caught, the neighbors told our moms and they decided to seperate us... i was so sad cuz i never saw him again, but i enjoyed all the time i spent with him. later, homer and i also got seperated cuz he was gettin kicked out of skool, so once again i lost a friend. he was like my brother too. and well i kept at skool, i was doing bad at skool too, i remember i always flunked like 8 classes every fuckin month. so i me tthis boy who's name was alex, we were cool and we both loved the band "queen". yes the band where the singer was gay and he died of HIV, they were great. but well once he came to my house, we started doing "dirty stuff" lol, as straigh boys, when suddenly he started... ya know, jerkin me off... and so did i to him, and it ended up into blowjobs and stuff. but we never had sex, cuz he said he was straight and that he was just curious, and ok, anyways i liked that experience. so i assumed i had avery big attraction to guys, bigger than to girls. but still i was confused about my preferences and all that stuff. anyways, i flunked that year becuz of my rebellion against every teacher and for not doing anything in class. so i got kicked out from there...   also that year my mom got a boyfriend named daniel, they still are together, and i love that dude as if he was my real father, cuz he cares for us like if he was. he is now also an important part of my life cuz he is so cool... doesnt matter if he is mexican as all the people i've met he is a good guy. my mom got this relationship when she got divorced from my father, cuz he drinks too much so he was just alittle violent IN THE BEGINNING... the bad stuff is just a few more years from there        13 years: jeez... well since i flunked7th grade, i had to repeat it, so i was sent to another skool, the crappiest skool indeed.at the beginning it was a little hard to get used to the new people, but anyways, after some months of being with them i got new friends, specially this lil guy named henry... lol he was weird too, but he was cool... well not really he didnt have a good taste in music but o well. also i got this friend named daniel lol i've met tons of daniels but lol this one liked nirvana and since i love nirvana we got along by that song "you know you're right" lol i remember we used to sing it all the time when we were at skool... weird lol he knew a little english so it was cool. so anyways, the skool once took us to a trip to veracruz, one of the most famous beachs of mexico, and we had a lot of fun, also a dude who i met at the other skool moved to that one, it was funny shit cuz we were on a bus to that place,driving a tnight so yea we were singing stupid songs and it was so fuckin funny,when we reached our destinationwe had even more fun, we swam at the beach, wegot a few drinks lol, we visited the ruins of "tajin" it was very interesting to see all these pyramids and stuff, then we saw a show thatis typical of that zone, named "the papantla fliers" its a bunch of people who go to the top of a tower and tie their feet and theystart spinning on the top of the towerIN THE AIR man its something cool and pretty interesting, and when the time togo back home we were again singing those ongs lol. also allthe guys who wereat the same seats i was started jackin off lol it was funnycuz i was surrounded by all these "dicks" haha so i did the same. and alsothe daniel dude (the guy from skool) did something i didnt expect him to do: blowy joby lmao. god it was weird but cool at the same time. i know this sound slike an erotic stroy lol but it isnt, its just that im remembering all the stuff i did and to give an explanation of why im bisexual. anyways some days later that dude and i had sex and blah blah lol im not gonn say a lot about that. and whenmy b-day came (july 5) the skool was already over, i was glad i was able to reach the 8th grade. i kept goin to the same skool.   14 years: yea thats when i had the roughest time of my life, exactly by august of the 2003, my dad came by very drank, and he started beating me for no reason. i know i was an unwanted child, but just by him. he didnt want me to be born but oh well i was lol so screw him. anyways as i was saying he started beating me, it was horrible cuz he was kicking me and hitting me and damn i was not able to do anything. and he also threatened me to death if i said something of this to my mom. i had bruises and all but i told my mom i got in a fight at skool and she believed me. i remember a day whenhe andi were playing this game, ya know measuring strenght, and of course he won, and he started calling me namesand shit, so, my mom went with some of her friends and we played again, a friend of mine was at my house so he tickled him and i won, so i called him names too a she did to me and he started beating me IN FRONT OF MY FRIEND. yea i told him not to tell anyone.and that torment kept going until december of the last year, when i decided to kill myself. i had that gun in my hands, loaded, ready to shoot... but some people helped me to get out of that situation when they told me that suicide wasnt the answer, and that it was not worth it, and they helped me. of course suicide is a quick and good answer, cuz you'll never be tormented again like that. but still,2 weeks before christmas, my mom wasnt home, she went to another state with my aunt and i was left with my father so he would "take care of me". that night became the worst, when he started beating me as usual, i did the worst thing you can do when a situation like that is going on: fighting back. i hit him hard in the face and he just looked at me, pulled out that gun and shot me in the arm. i blacked out due to the pain that the bullet caused to me. but i was able to get that bullet out at the hospital, i went alone so no one would find out. and my mom came back 2 weeks later, my arm was already healed when she came back, and for some strange reason my dad decided not to come back. the reason why i couldnt tell anyone about the way he treated me was becuz he is a cop, and he is the "most accurate" unit at his job, he got a lot of connections at the government, a his job and everywhere. so it would be useless. so i didnt see him for a while, but then he came back, this time i locked myself in my room, so he wouldnt do anything but it was so strange... he came cuz he wanted to apologize for being "bad" with me and for not caring when i needed anything. he wanted to come back but i didnt let him come back. but he kept coming to my house to bring food and money and everyhting we need. its strange cuz after all that torture he now wants to be my father, to wich i responded with a fuck off. and he kept coming but i always locked myself in my room.     15 years: this is now, im 15 years old, and well about my father, he keeps coming, i decided to talk to him and be nice, anyways he doesnt deserve it but this time i only talk to him for basic stuff, and i dont let him be with me alone, cuz that'd be like suicide. or i dont know but i think im better now... except for skool. im smart and all but i cant deal with algebra, and im so lazy, so it doesnt work. so this was all my post, i hope u had "fun" reading, and well to keep reading about my 15 years, just keep comin lol. see ya all, and dont cry when ya finish readin all this heh. byes
