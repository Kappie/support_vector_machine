I was too blind to notice that my actions have upset them. Indeed, my actions were dispicable, centred only at self-gain and nothing else.   Right from the start of PW, i've been making them upset with the things i say, and the way i choose to do things. It was all for a self-centered motive, that is, to get through PW as fast as possible and do well. To do that, my plot was basically to marginalise them, and leave the work to myself and Vaibhav, just because Vanessa and Nay Ling were not able to produce work as quality-based as us.  So i left them out of most of the time when it came to distributing the work. And not only that, i even remarked at times about their incompetency, in direct conversation with them. I wanted so badly to do well for PW without having to be bothered by incompetent members, that i failed to realise that i was being such a disgusting creature.  Eventually the group suffers. Miss Goh has placed a lot of negative comments in her report, about how divided our group is over the project, and about how there is no teamwork evident at all, and yes, its all because of my actions.   Even then, i still had the cheek to tell Nay Ling, "You need to speak up more during meetings, you and Vanessa are not contributing", as though it was their fault Miss Goh was disappointed with our group. She sure has got every right to be pissed with me.  Only today did i finally realise the impacts and consequences of my actions. It took Vaibhav to tell me straight in the face that i was being so utterly self-centered, that i was always being very unfair to Vanessa and Nay Ling, and how i had upset them through my words and actions, which reflected very well that i thought of them as obsolete and less capable. Vaibhav knew that i was only interested in points and grades, and that i was willing to compromise trust and consideration of others in getting it. What he said that struck me the most however, was that all i was interested in was points,when it should actually be about thrust, not about points. I realised then that this was true. I had been self-centered and thought only of Points, and bothered myself at all with Vanessa and Nay Ling.   I owe Vanessa and Nay Ling a really serious apology, not just for screwing up the project, but for hurting them. I also do owe Vaibhav a big thank you for finally bringing me out of this self-centeredness of mine. He has certainly opened my eyes to see the sin i have indulged in, and what he said has somehow made me a little wiser....
