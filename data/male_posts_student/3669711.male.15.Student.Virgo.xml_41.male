Well, i rebooted once or twice to change some settings, and it seems as if i broke it.  So, down the drain went linux.    Well, after deciding that i wasn't going to fix it right then, i went outside to read Left Behind, the first book.  Hmmm yes, i am enthralled by that book.  Enjoying it very much!  Yes indeed.  Anyways, after about an hour of reading, i went back inside and started up the Gentoo Live Cd again.  Well, the install process this time took half as much time.  I had it all installed in about 5 hours 30 mins.    So, after installing it and making sure it booted, i just left it, and rebooted into windows, where i watched some hard earned anime.    Well, then came today.  What to do on linux?  Well, i started off by getting an essential too, XFree86.  I emerged that and installed it, and it worked fine.  Then i configured my mouse and video card to suit it's needs, and then started it up.  It was beautiful, ugly, but beautiful.  It worked ^_^.  I was proud of my efforts so far.    Well, then i decided i needed a Desktop Environment, something that gives Linux a GUI-ish feel.  I chose  urlLink Fluxbox , a DE thats sort of 'minimal'.  Any of you who have experimented with linux before know that choosing a DE like KDE can take up to 24 hours to compile.  Well, this is not the problem with Fluxbox.  It took all of 30 mins to compile the whole thing and get it running.  Then i installed my login manager(a really ugly one) and was good to go.  Well, since then, i have been tweaking my system by getting some programs, such as  urlLink Mozilla  Thunderbird and Firefox, The GIMP, Gkrellm, GAIM, and XMMS.  Yes, well that was all i could manage to do today.  After i get all the programage i need, i will begin tweaking the overall look of my *nix box.  Yes, it will be cool, i guarentee it!
