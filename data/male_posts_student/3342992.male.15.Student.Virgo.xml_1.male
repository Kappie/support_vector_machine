Then after the phone call..i was like really thinkin' that mC and my character...as in our thots..are like kinda world apart..perhaps it's b/c the diff. kind of friends we have..then i like kinda wanna give up already manz.. cos i feel like we both have repelling characterz.. and perhaps it's true or very true that i don't know her that well..afterall b4 fallin in (L) with her. bUt donnno why or how..the next day..i'm back to likin' her that much manz..         but the cOOl part of tues' night was after i put down the phone...cos' i kinda sms her and asked her a Q... and the Q was " miNg cHuAn.. where am i standing now..in your heart..am i just beside you..or far away form you.. "..then once again larhz..u know her pattern lols.. she replied " dOtX mAnZ.." lols..bUt later on..she told me..she said ..plZ allow mUa to quote..lolz..--> "yaa not very far away from me...nor very close to me..middle middle.." . actually arhs..why must she add the " nor very close to me " part..demoralised me manz..really lahz..after i saw that part..felt a bit demoralized..lolz..but later on..when i asked " am i standing right where i stood a month back...? " then she said no lahz.. she said..that i improved a lots!! heheez!!! =D yeah!i! heheheheehz! but i guess i still have a long wayz to go manz.. think at least she needs 2 more mths.. wOof!
