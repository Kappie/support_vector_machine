I am a 17 years old and have never kissed any girl. When I was 12, I made the commitment to God and myself, that I would completely save all forms of physical intimacy for my wife until my wedding day, including my first kiss. Now, I had no idea to the vastness of what I was committing to at that point. Over these past 5 years I have only by the grace of strength of God stayed true to these commitments. But as you read these next couple of paragraphs, I hope you will see that what I write I do not   only   write, but also live as a lifestyle. The questions I will present to you here are simple. Yet, steer away from their simplicity and you may find yourself in very deep philosophical waters. I do not wish to create theories or enforce rules. All I desire in this is that people think further than they have about this subject before, and that they open their minds to the possibilities of new ideas; ideas that   may   change your life.                     My first question is: What is a   kiss  ?      Is it simply when two pairs of lips meet? Is it when those same lips are brushed softly on a cheek? Or is it when two pairs of lips are pressed together, separated and the tongues collide and caress each other? I will not answer these questions as definite, but merely as my own personal conviction. My commitment is to keep my lips to myself entirely. I believe that I should not separate one kiss from another. A kiss is a kiss. Now, I do agree that when you are not   romantically   involved with someone, such as family members or those you feel as family, a kiss changes it’s emotional meaning. But it is still indeed a kiss. Then a second question arouses from the first:   What   is a kiss? Is it the showing of a strong loving affection of two friends? The outward display of an inward feeling? Or is it the acknowledgement of two lovers ready to unite and become one? I believe that all of the previous statements, dependant on the variables of each individual relationship. I don’t think anyone could (or should) kiss their mom or dad with the same emotional and physical intimacy they would with their husband or wife. This brings the idea to light that every kiss is different dependant on the moment that it is made. To me, there are just too many variables involved. Honestly, I wouldn’t want to trust myself to those ever-changing circumstances and the dangerous possibility of compromise. Why should I willingly put myself in circumstances that will tempt me?                     This brings me to my next thought.      I have long believed that sex is a complete act; from start to finish. I just recently came upon this article that properly displays my viewpoint. It may be a bit extreme, but sometimes you need extremity to produce productivity. John White writes:                    “Defining coitus in terms of penetration and orgasm has as much moral significance and as much logical difficulty as trying to define a beard by the number of hairs on a chin . . .”           “I know that experts used to distinguish light from heavy petting, and heavy petting from intercourse, but it there any moral difference between two naked people in bed petting to orgasm and another two having intercourse? Is the one act a fraction of an ounce less sinful than the other? Is it perhaps more righteous to pet with clothes on? If so, which is worse, to pet with clothes off or to have intercourse with clothes on?          You may accuse me of being crude. Far from it. If we continue the arguments far enough, we see that the morality of premarital sex that is based on the details of behavior (kissing, dressing, un-dressing, touching, holding, looking) and parts of the body (fingers, hair, arms, breast, lips, genitalia) can only satisfy a Pharisee. A look can be as sensual as a touch, and a finger brushed lightly over a cheek as erotic as penetration.”   - John White, Eros Defiled (Downers Grove, Ill.: Intervarsity Press, 1977), 53.                       This excerpt caused me great thought.      If indeed a look can be as sensual as a touch, have I ever looked any girls in that way? I pray that I haven’t and do not believe I have. But the reality of those simply stated three paragraphs have much theological depth to them. I completely believe with Mr. White in that sex is   much   more than just intercourse, it’s everything combined into one complete unit. It includes body-language, looking with the eyes and even the emotions. This is why I believe Jesus said, “. . .      anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart     .” If even the looking of the eyes is the beginning of sexual intimacy, then how can a kiss (or any other form of physical affection)   not   be of that same nature?                     But finally, I will say this: The greatest and most important fact is that God   must   be glorified in whatever circumstances of your relationship.      I am not saying kissing doesn’t glorify God, nor am I saying that it glorifies God   more   than not kissing. I simply ask these questions to make you think. To make you think deeper and more specifically. My hope is that God will speak to some of you and move your hearts through reading this and it will spur on a new desire for sexual, emotional and spiritual purity in your lives.
