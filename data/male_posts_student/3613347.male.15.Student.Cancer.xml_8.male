I had to struggle with the temptation to sleep to catch the 'live' action, but it was worth it. England were struggling throughout the match but they managed to pull ahead through Frank Lampard's header.  The second half saw several yellow cards and penalties. Silvestre should have been red carded, and David James too. Beckham's missed penalty inadvertly cost England 2 points, but i felt Barthez did great, and i felt it was logical for him to guess the England Captain would shoot to the left. He takes his free kicks side-footed, thus most of his kicks go to the left.   The funny part of the game is that Barthez blocked a shot with his nose!!! Can you believe it? He fumbled with a normal shot and it bounced off the ground and hit his nose!   It wasn't until injury time that France made the surprise comeback. A freekick just outside the penalty box taken by Zidane gave France their equalizer. 1 minute later, Henry was set free by Gerrard's miscued backpass but was brought down by David James. YELLOW CARD? I felt it should've been a red. Zidane calmly put France 2-1 up.  Overall, i felt that France dominated the game, while England's defence held strong. Won't be catching the match tonight though, as it aint a great match, and i need to sleep tonight!
