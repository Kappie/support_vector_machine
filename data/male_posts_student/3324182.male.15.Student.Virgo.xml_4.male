I have nothing better to do. In other news, I have been downloading more than usual. I got the entire FF-X OST in about 30 minutes. That's about 80 songs. Then I had to do the ID3 tags. That took another 10 minutes. I   PRO is what I use mostly to get musik if you want to check it out.  urlLink John  hooked me up with it.  So now I don't know what to write. So I'm out.
