This stuff could probably work either way, but I own a PlayStation, and can therefore make more points about it than I can about XBox.  The point of this post is to try to give Nintendo characters a new chance at life.  I'm sure that the only reason they all seem gay and immature in the Nintendo games is that they are in, well, gay, immature Nintendo games.  The characters themselves are worthy of reconciliation, though.  If put in an XBox of PS2 game, they COULD be pretty cool.  So, here is my analysis of every important Nintendo character I can think of.  Mario-Occupation: Plumber           Ethinicity: Italian           Video Games: Too many to count.  The only ones that matter are Super Mario World and the original Mario Kart Racing.           Appearance: Short, slightly fat guy wearing a red hat and suspender overalls.           Pros: Can shoot fire balls, ride a dinosaur, become invincible, and jump many times his height.           Cons: His own company went too far, much like with Pok√©mon, effectively drowning him.           Chances of Reconciliation:  Actually, I don't think there's much hope for this guy.  The only thing i can think of would be to completely re-do his entire image.  Yoshi, who is also worthy of note, would have to be entirely refurbished to give him more of a standing among the veterans, such as the dragons in Drakengard and Reign of Fire.  The fire balls would have to be turned into some sort of FLAMING INFERNO (sorry, got a little carried away) and the invincibility would have to do something neat, for instance, disintegrating enemies on the spot.  If none of this works, he could make guest appearances as a flunky in some other game.  Maybe.  Wario-Wario is hopeless.  He is a copy of Mario, and should die.  Samus-Occupation: Bounty hunter/police force or something like that.            Ethnicity: Probably Japanese at first.            Video Games: Once again, too many.  I think there were four, not counting the GameBoy versions.            Appearance: Woman dressed in only a bikini, protected by a huge metal suit of electronic armor.            Pros: Can create bombs at will (at least on Super Smash Brothers), fire a giant laser beam, and jump fairly high.            Cons: I think the only con was that her first appearance was on a Nintendo platform.            Chances of Reconciliation:  I think all Samus needs is a good, well-planned PS2, but preferably XBox FPS.  Or, she could make some sort of guest appearance as an optional character on someone else's game.  Link-Occupation: Rescuer of Zelda.         Ethnicity: Human or maybe elven.  I'm not sure.         Video Games: Occarina of Time, Link's Awakening, Four Swords, and some other one.         Appearance: Elven, short, and dressed like Robin Hood.         Pros: Can carry something like twelve weapons at the same time, is skilled with all of them, and, with the ring of power, can pick up and throw boulders.  In some games he can throw some sort of fire powder, too.         Cons: Can't seem to see when it's over with the princess.  I mean, come on, she keeps getting herself trapped in closed rooms by other people, and all he does is just go save her again and again.  Get a clue, Link.         Chances of Reconciliation:  Very few, if any.  I think Sony would have to make this game - Microsoft does better with shooters and action RPGs.  It would have to be some game where he turns dark and goes and kills the Princess, then does something along the lines of God of War.  Yep, that's right - I am become Link, destroyer of worlds.  Okay, that's all I have for right now.  If you have any other ideas, feel free to post them.
