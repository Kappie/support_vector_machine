(which I love... the car :P and this song) but anyway reason being why I was in his car was because today I was at the DRAMA CLUB booth for inrollment... it was so much fun! I havent seen some of the people in a long time.. including Joley... (which I've found out that I spelled her name wrong in my scrapbook..) Macy.. which I love! shes such a good person.. and some times I feel so stupid around her.. because of some of the things I do.. (tell ya more later) Emma which I havent talked to all summer.. I was kind of iffy on talking to her because she found out about "me" and I've heard that shes not to fond about it.. but me and her clicked just like we've always have... so it was good.. I also saw Kenny there.. which he kind of pissed me off.. because he was behind the booth.... which... I feel that you should'nt be able to if your not a thespian.. thats just my point of view on it.. I mean he could have joined last year.. but chose sports over becoming a thespian... but you know whatever.. I'm still kind of mad about it... and it bothers me because of David.. maybe he wont be such a good president after all... I mean I voted for him but I'm thinking that I should have voted for someone else. After today seeing him and his actions around Kenny were strange... its like hes letting Kenny do all this stuff because he might have a crush on him :-/ and thats a stupid reason... he told Kenny that he could come to freshmen orentation... WHAT? I think that made me mad as well as it did to Julie... he should'nt be able to come, I mean don't get me wrong Kenny is an awesome person... but he should wait just like WE had to wait... I mean I watched all the thespians do all the cool stuff... with out me.. but I just thought.. I'll do that when I'm a thespian... and now that I am a thespian I can do those things.. and I'm so pumped up for next year.. I can't wait for it to get here.... people tell me that it will go by sooo sooo fast.. and I hope it does but I want to cherish every second of it.. and take lost of pictures!! :P (gah I'm such a dork)   so I've found out that I have two classes with Julie first trimester!! I'm so happy we actually have drama A and drama B together... I didnt have to change it after all! :P thats 4th hour... and then we both have 5th hour math.. with Justice... its going to be fun.. well I hope it will be :-/ so I have tons more to talk about but It'll have to wait till tonight... I'm bored right now.. I think my mom just got home, and I want her to take me to get a frappochino. I'm so addicted :P later  nyny
