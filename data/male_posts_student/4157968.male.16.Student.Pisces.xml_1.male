On Noveber the 22nd Seasons One, Two, and Three, of SEINFELD will be available for purchase via DVD. Words can not describe how happy I was to hear this. I immediatly rank this day amoung my top five days of my life, and I've had some pretty good times. There's simply no limit to the amound of good this has done in the world, and quite frankly, I'm thinking of forgoing the entire 2nd half of the month of November in order to watch all the episodes... Again, and again!
