There were five that went, armed with axe and song, determined to make their mark upon this darkened realm. With a grey sky over their heads and a warm wind on their backs, they set out eastward upon their journey, a fortnight of challenge ahead of them. Some will laugh and name them fools, but I know better, for I have heard their tales before, and know their skill quite well...  Their foes will be dark and terrible, unlike any they have ever faced before. Against a shadowy campaign of a gluttonous king they must test their strength, but the will of the Northmen is in their blood. Viking lords and autumn knights, undead hordes and frozen others await their arrival with fire and steel, but the legacy of the five is none to forget...  For these are the Brothers of Winterfell, and though their tale has just begun, they have already conquered many a foe. Was it not the Son of the Fire God who fell before their icy blades? Did they not resist the will of the Circlet of Doom? And woe be to the fool who hears their echoing wail, for its sound smote even the greatest Angels of War from our Heaven's blue sky. As it was once before, again they will wage their war, and this time the chill of the coming winter will be even greater.....  I hail thee, Brothers of Winterfell, and I wish you all courage and vigilance in your battles to come. I only regret I could not carry your swords, but I will await your return, and am eager for more tales of your victories.....
