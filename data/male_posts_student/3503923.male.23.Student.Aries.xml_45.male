You may think to yourself; 'Golly gosh, what a fine man, pursuing goodness and desiring love.' After this, I'd ask you to review the defining moments of my life, and conclude whether I had lived the lyric in action or wished for it on a ganja cloud.  Esteemed musician, fine artist, lyricist beyond compare; woven together sounds to delight the soul, full of sensual smoothness to get you walking on 'solid air'. An alluring kind of quality permeates throughout his work. The lyrics dance lazily, oozing with an upward vibe, a zestful call-out to run from the evil in the world.  Hoodwinked. By the winker in da hood. Contrived. A carefully engineered mask. The man of peace came forth, declaring the virtue of war. Try as you may, to reach that elusive standard, the true ideal; your graciousness has not the elegance to conceal from where you came. A troubadour from the saloon, with a voice of silk, fist cold as stone; singing of love, while the truth unfolds. We men, know the art of mis-communication, of mixed messages, delivered from a podium on high.  It took him time, 40 years to be precise, to understand that thumping another isn't so nice. From a position of violence to begrudging passivity. Transformation, a turn in the heart. How did he finally come to know? To discover a capacity within him to refrain and say 'NO'. Would a clear recipe suffice? Just quickly. Wham bam, that's how it all began, to remain in the flow start with a bang. Bang; in goes the Yin into the Magimix, something from both polars, a little white, a little black. Bang; throw in some Zen Buddhism, to show you the way. Bang; a smidgen of da herb, to polish off the concoction.  Would it be safe to assume, for arguments sake, that the green-fingered herbalist would never strike. He is now a conscious objector practicing pacifism, a man of peace, with a heart full of anger. When the ganja no longer grows and the resistance turns brittle, where do you turn? Who would you throttle?  Contradictions leave you a little puzzled, scratching your head for answers. No, not a nit fest scratch, but a poised scratch of puzzlement. I sing about love and practise evil. Am I a liar, or am I weak?
