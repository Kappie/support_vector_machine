I just brought a reminder of deep sadness to me... that... is difficult to describe. I feel this mountain of emotions and love inside of me and it yearns to release itself all the time. Many times I can contain it but at other times it erupts and floods my consciouness. With her I found an outlet for this and she absorbed all the love I had to give. With that said I find that my well of love is deeper than I could have ever imagined and I thirst for my new love to draw those waters again. I thirst for that feeling and that dream of love which is no longer part of me life. I wait for the moment when I will find it once again so I can see what waters are drawn. I do not know who will draw my love's well in the future, but I am anxious for that coming of the day. Until that day comes I know a part of me will always be wanting for someone...   Late at night, it is an odd feeling of "alone-ness" that I find myself bathed in. It is indiscribable in many ways. Of accepting what has come to pass and realizing the events in my life that have unfolded the way they have had a deeper meaning than I would have known previously. My thoughts are entangled in my emotions and memories and so my thoughts are muddled at best,but in these moments I find myself; and must find myself in the hope that somewhere in this world there is someone who will draw my water's well.  I do not know for how long I can allow my well to be undrawn for I can feel that the water level rises every day and I do not know what will happen when it will overflow. What will happen only the future and fate will reveal to me. For now, I keep my eyes set on a better world and a dream--in these thoughts I hope I can find the love of my life once again, whoever and wherevershe is... I wait for her...  125 am  I am not a political robot...a machine... I have come to learn my own humanity in the course of a broken heart and that is the greatest lesson the love I have had and lost taught me. It is that which is buried inside of me and reaffirms the existence of my being and life. I have emotions that swell deep in my heart and run deeper in my words. It is a reminder of all the blessings that God has given me,in joy and in sadness he/ she has made me who I am...  145am  there is a part of me that says it is time to close this journey and stop blogging. i do not know why...as if i am ready... to move on... but to what...  I feel that the person who I will fall in love will have to be someone who was born in the struggle like the way I was forged and carved in the struggle for a better world.When the experiences of violent protests, politics, massive rallies mark our humanity,it is on a profound level that is only comparable to the witnessing of birth and death itself.Only someone who has felt the pains of struggle can possibly understand what I have went through and what and why I am willing to go through in the future. Only she can fit my in a manner that will complete both us...  212am  tonight my emotions and thoughts sweat as if they are in the amazon jungle. drenched in my own energy and thoughts of the present and future. political ideas buzzing pass my mind and dreams racing through my heart i cannot fall asleep no matterhow badly body desires it so...
