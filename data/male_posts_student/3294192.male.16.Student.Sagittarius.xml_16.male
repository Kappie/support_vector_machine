"Today brings me one day closer to summer, which in turn is looking less and less like the summers of yesteryear. I've got but three finals left, and then I'm free for a week. Then it's back in the slammer for four weeks, for 6 hours a day, flexing my camera arm. It's sounding more and more labor intensive though, as today Mr. G mentioned set construction. Now, I'm no film surgeon, but that sounds like a job for lowly grips, and I'm no grip.  The other day I was lucky enough to receive an invitation to the Beta-testing of  urlLink Gmail ,  urlLink Google 's venture into the world of free mail hosting. The service runs without a client through a web browser of your preference (mine is  urlLink Mozilla ), which makes it accessible through most any computer, and offers an impregnable 1 gigabyte of storage, which means you'll never have to delete a message. Gmail also organizes mail into conversations, much like a forum, which makes it a lot easier for back tracking, rather than switching between Inbox and Sent folders. I happened to acquire my invite through the wonderful  urlLink Gmail Swap , so go check it out if you want try and snag your own. Eventually I should be given a few invitations, which I can give back to the community that gave so much to me. In return for an invite, I offered to mail a Travel Journal to the generous donor. "What's a travel journal" you ask?, well..  A travel journal is a notebook or scrap book that is passed one from one person to another, each filling out a few pages with whatever they want, until the book is filled and returned to the originator. I learned about these through the  urlLink 1000 Journals  project, which has been going on for quite a long time now, and has an ever expanding collection returned books to browse the pages of. Quite inspiring stuff. I plan to mail away my first blank journal as soon as I can get some gaffer's tape to toughen up the cover. The recipient happens to live in Japan, so I'm expecting some wacky shit in return. Perhaps I should include instructions in Japanese as well? My friend in Nishinomiya can help me out with that.  ON the subject of journals, I've started one containing all my notes in regards to modding my little Xbox. I plan to go the way of a chipless-mod, based on an exploit within MechAssault. The tutorial I'm using can be found  urlLink here , written by the experienced "Mad_Gouki", and recommended by the famous  urlLink Kevin Rose . Pretty soon, If I can do it right, my Xbox will be able to backup my games to its HDD, run a media player, emulate the classics like SNES and Genesis, and even run a web browser, through which (using the awesome Gmail) I can check my messages.  I'm really proud the way all my topics were connected, it makes me feel competent."
