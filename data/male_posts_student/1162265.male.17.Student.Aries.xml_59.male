Me and Nia watched the Ring, scared the crap outta me (I’ve seen it in the theatre) Nia was barely shaken though.  She says maybe Ringu will scare her.  I finished packing two things, then we both fell asleep watching Platinum.  It was alright, but it can’t last on UPN, because they gotta hold themselves back on that channel.  	Anyway, mom woke us up around 4:30ish, and Mr. Spence drove us to the airport.  We got through all the boring stuff really easy.  Took a plane to St. Louis, all boring nothing really to note about that flight.  I didn’t even see anything nice.  We got off at SL, went to buy souveniors (pues, no me) and then went to Cinnabon.  I got sick from eating those things. Then after we got on the plane to Cancun.  It was pretty boring as well, and I was able to force myself to sleep, until we arrived close to Cancun, when I started looking out at the ocean, until we passed near the shallow waters, the hotels, and then town.  We landed, and went through customs (Oldivemos las formas), but it took awhile.  I saw Liza Wengner and Carly Brodsky, weird.  Then we met the travel guy, who spoke nice English and I said my only Spanish of the day muy pocito when he asked if we spoke Spanish.  Went to the Hotel, another family was in the van and they spoke Spanish as well.   	 	We finally got to the Hotel, had a problem getting our room and then we waited for a bit.  Some kids ran up to the lady at the counter, and started yelling stuff at her in Spanish about there room and the key.  She quickly answered.  I began to realize that Chicanos come here (Cancun) for vacation as well (Debo parce que cuando la pilot habla en Espanol).  When we got our room, me and Nia changed and went down to the beach.  Jumped around some, and then ate dinner.  We got back to the room around six, and I decided it was time to sleep some more.  So I kept waking up and falling asleep until it was the next day….  Day 2- Timeshares y ir de comprar!  	Today was much more interesting, one could say.  We started off the day by going to a “free” breakfast that was promised to us at the Moon Palace Hotel, it was pretty nice, and our host Roberto would show us around afterwards.  We talked about casual stuff until we were all finished eating.  Then he started comparing buying stock in the MPH with buying a timeshare.  Blah, blah…. After many trials and tribulations we went to see the palatial presidential suite, which was quite nice, if a little excessive and their huge mile long snaking pool.  Then came the business part where he tried to have his boss sell us this quasi-timeshare.  His boss unfortunately was an old white man who looked like he burned easily.  His attitude was similar to his appearance, and despite how good the offer may have sounded we fortunately were not sold.  He then had his Latin boss try to sell us.  It didn’t work either.  So regardless we got money for cabs back to the hotel and free t-shirts.  Waste of time? 	Afterwards, we returned to the hotel and went out to the beach and splashed around, then lied on the lawn chairs where I fell into deepthinking and I felt a feeling of hatred of the trip.  It was very strange.  Then ofcourse came the days other main event the mall.  It was pretty boring, all the stores were ultra-capitalistic clothe stores.  So I stayed mostly out of them.  Ask me about the Spanish man and girl who approached me and proved I can’t speak Spanish under pressure. All in all though, the day was good.  Day 3- Chichen Itza  	I hate heat.  Mexicans are extremely strong if they can live in this unbearable heat. Today we went to Chichen Itza it’s an old Mayan city, with tons of ruins, but the ride there was interesting .  We needed to get up real early, to take a long bus ride.  Most of the people on the bus spoke Spanish, and were from varied countries.  It was especially weird to have girls from Costa Rica on vacation here (in Mexico).  We stopped a lot, first to a store where a guy around my age had a nice sales pitch of saying “dude”.    	Then we visted a Mayan village, that was pretty fun.  It was also depressing at the same time.  I saw some girls with kids dressed in some major brand of fresh new jeans in an old looking sunbaked house, without windows and kids in rags.  I hate capitalism.  	Finally after more crap.  We arrived at Chichen Itza and went on tour.  Our guide was great but the British people with us were so dumb and asked the dumbest questions (was the blood real or symbolic?)  After they had left we finished off the tour, and me, Nia and Dad did the dumb thing of climbing the pyramid.  It was a long way up and getting down was so hard, it scared the crap outta me.  Finally after all that we went to the bus, and dad was the last one on due to major CP time.  We drove home, most of the people sleeping and got back to the hotel.  Pictures say a thousand words.  Day 4- Tuluum and Xel-ha (and some racism?)  	The day started the same as yesterday, woke up early and went to the bus.  It was a similar bus except most of the people on it spoke English this time.  Not half and half.   We stopped only at once rest stop where they did this cool thing of crafting obsidian, the stuff can cut class apparently.  Pictures speak louder then words.  After that we went to Tuluum which was a Mayan  city from during the end of Pre-hispanic times.  The guide was a Mayan, but he said only the lower class of Mayans has survived.  I didn’t like the site as much as Chichen Itza, but it was pretty cool.  Especially some of the designs on the buildings.  	Then we went to a tourist trap, I guess it could count for an amusement park of sorts, it was called Xel-ha (shelha) some weird Mayan word.  The only thing I wanted to do was snorkel though, and snorkel I did.  One could get a raft or just  swim with or w/o a life jacket.  I choose neither knowing they’d only seek to inhibit me.  It was pretty fun, their was one point where you could jump two or three meters off a cliff into the water, and afterwards scale the cliff.  Me and Nia did both, while at the same time dad got into an argument with this Spanish guy over Nia’s inner tube.  Then one of the workers their came over to my dad and started asking if he made a deposit.  Assuming the guy was telling the worker all this in Spanish, it was annoying how he took his side in believing my father was a thief while his wife had the inner tube, and my dad was trying to tell him.  My father was rightfully pretty pissed, and we left that area and continued along the course.  We finished the course shortly after.  We ate dinner, and then got on the bus and went home.  I got back to the hotel in time to watch BP but it wasn’t on.  American Idol was.  I was gonna cry, because the guy joked about people tuning into watch BP.  Gah!  Read the something from “Thunder: Perfect Mind” weird hymn apparently it’s related to the writings in the Gitas/ Upashanids then the Judeo-Christian stuff.  Religion never leaves me.   Day 5-  Viaje a Isla de las Mujeres y Two drunk Gay guys  	Today, fun stuff.  We went on our free timeshare trip.  It was to Isla Mujeres, this small Island off the coast of Quintana Roo.  It felt a lot like Martha’s vineyard.  The first place we stopped was a beach town.  We had a choice of expensive activities, but me and dad didn’t feel like paying so we went and got some free food instead.  The food was pretty good, and then I started talking with the cook there he looked about 17 to 20.  And he told me I looked like a New Yorker.  Funny.  	Went to sleep after that, Nia and Mom were lounging on the beach so I follow suite and slept for about two hours.  From about twelve to two.  We got on the boat afterwards, and went up the Island. Fortunately dad was able to get us on a snorkeling expedition.  So when we got to the North of the island we got on a small fishing boat.  Two guys were there.  One driving the boat, the other diving with us.  My father asked if others were coming and if they were men or women.  The guy looked confused and said “neutral” I thought it was because he didn’t know.  	It ended up the other two guys were drunk gay latinos.  They got on the boat after finishing way to many tequilas.  It didn’t help that they talked with high voices in English,  but also drunk voices.  Quite funny.  Ask me to do my impression of them.  When we got in, I being a minor, had to wear a life jacket.  It was still great, and may dad almost had a heart-attack from the excitement of seeing some many barracuda.  I didn’t realize they were canivorus so they just looked like big fish to me.  It was fun, and we got back on the boat.  Where the drunk Cuban was talking about how he never swam before and it was like a perrito he tried to explain it in English without being blunt.  My dad didn’t understand fortunately.  I’m not gonna make him aware.  	Afterwards we got back on shore.  Rented a golf cart, picked up Nia and Mom and started to drive around.  My dad let me drive, but I almost crashed the thing.  So he continued to drive, and I took pictures.  Stuff would have slowed down when we returned the cart and got back on the boat back to Cancun, but the guys on the boat had a party.  It was insanity for such a small boat.  I even got a shot of tequila it was watered down.  My father was right, even though he was drunk, I could agree with him that it was like Kool-Aid.  I’m sure I need to only drink a bit more alcohol in my life, before I can hate it enough never to drink again. I agree with Claude Brown, you need to know what your missing to truly abstain from it.  It’s like that with pork now, I tasted it twice on this trip and I hate the taste.  It’s so overly greasy and nasty.  I doubt I’ll ever be able to do that with other meats because I can’t convince myself that they are slave foods.  Day 6- Scuba!  When I woke up today the first thing on my mind was leaving.  I just wanted to go home, but the day managed to unfold quite well.  I signed up for a morning scuba class, with no guarentee of going on a dive after, but I didn't care.  The lesson was great, and it was taught by this British lady who somehow was able to speak Spanish fluently with a British accent.  The class was great, except my fins were far to big, so my legs got tired out.  This didn't much matter though, because the artifical reef in the diving tank was cool, combined with the interesting sensation of breathing underwater (it was a lot easier then I thought).  Me and dad went to the Beachwalk resturant after, and ate lunch.  I was about to go swimming when a woman from Aqua World ran up to me, and said "Their's Space on a Scuba run, someone just canceled but it's in less then half an hour!"  Me and dad rushed to get our stuff together hurried and got a Cab over to Aqua World,  we made it to the boat just before it left.  The scuba diving trip was unique and probubly my favorite element of the trip.  From the guy showing us the Scuba signal for "Bullshit", and the amazement of seeing all the undersea life and the reefs, I really must admit it was great.  The other three in our group had no problems, and it was so fun.  Sadly when I got out, the boat was rocking and I almost threw up, so I had to sit looking green all the way back.  It was still good.    When we got back to the hotel we debated on what mall to go to, and ended up just going to Kukulkan Plaza Mall to buy some Tequilla for my father.  Then we took the bus back to Aqua World, got our pictures (which mom thought were crap, and oh crap I've just changed the tense) and got back to the Hotel.  At the Hotel we ate at a resturant, our final meal before we left.  Good stuff.     I don't care to mention the journey home.  Boring.  Now your Marcus fans can relax.
