According to Roman Catholic tradition, Easter is the day that we celebrate Christ's triumph over death.  It will have been 3 days since he died, and then he will return to heaven on the day of the Ascension.  Ok.  Sound fun, huh?  How about Ostara (aka Eostre).  She was a pagan goddess of the spring (Germanic origins).  Her sacred objects are eggs and rabbits.  Sound familiar?  Well, I dont really feel like going much further into it, but isnt it cool how old pagan tradition survived this far to be associated with a Christian thing?  Anyways.  Bored.  Gonna do something productive now.  Like homework  It was a beautiful day today.  Just wish I could sit outside forever...
