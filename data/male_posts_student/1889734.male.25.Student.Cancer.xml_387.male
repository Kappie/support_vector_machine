This is the original British docudrama that inspired the movie, Traffic a few years ago.  I liked the film, and rented this through Netflix.  (And if you aren't aware of Netflix, I HIGHLY recommend it for your DVD rental needs).  Anyway, this was quite good, and I moved the final three parts up in my rental queue this morning.  An interesting look at all aspects of the drug trade.
