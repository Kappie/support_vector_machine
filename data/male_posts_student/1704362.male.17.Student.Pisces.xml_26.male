The weeks of emails, IMs, phone calls, telegrams, letters, and skywriting messages have drilled it into my brain.   I know that you're not wearing pants. That's not the problem, though. The problem is that I don't care. The fact that you're not wearing pants presents no interest to me whatsoever. It frightens me that you seem to think that I, and the rest of the world, has an extreme interest in the clothed-ness of your lower half.   Now that that's out of the way, Why The Hell Aren't You Wearing Pants? If it's a comfort issue, i'm sure you could have found at least one pair of leggings that you are inclined towards. If you're trying to make a political statement, i'm also sure that you could have found a better way to express yourself. If you just felt like it, that's your personal prerogative. But don't you think you could have found a better place to take off your pants than in the middle of an airport? Sooner or later, someone's going to try and stop you. And it might just be me, if you tell me one more time that you're not wearing any pants.  Don't say it. You've pushed me to the edge.  End Transmission.
