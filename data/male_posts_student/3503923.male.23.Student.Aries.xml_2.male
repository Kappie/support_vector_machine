In our 'advanced', 'progressive state' of being, the computer-age is a defining element of modern culture. It shows us how far we have come, how progressive we are, the efficiency and economy of the times, it also upholds the notion of change, giving credibility to the idea of evolution. We are going places! The technocrat places his faith in the ability of machinery to save humanity from their plight. The tidal wave of technology has come crashing upon us, sweeping us off our feet, and into the unknown. The rip curl off that tidal wave, has hit me for behind, and I also have succumb to the overtures of the computer-age.  The 'impersonal unknown' is what I'm engaged with, it may become known, if you learn its language and spend countless hours in communication. I do not speak the language of computers. I do not know why they do certain things. I was told in school that computer illiteracy would be my ruin, if you did not move with the times your existence was rendered meaningless, a spare part in the relentless machine of advancement. Abandoned and obsolete like old hardware in the skip at the science-park. Of no use, expired and out-of date like Windows 95. The education system dreamed up a future of dependence, dependence to the computer. Those in the know would be employable, those who didn't know their @ from their tab and their Java from their F12 would be unemployable. I am unemployable.   I'm illiterate, I cannot communicate with the computer. I do not understand it, it does not understand me. I do not want to understand the computer. It is a functional tool. I use and abuse it, when the abuse is too severe it crashes, when it crashes I become irate. It often crashes. I'm often irate. The printer cable from the PC does not fit into my MAC. It confuses me. I save essays that I have worked on for hours. There is no record of my essay, all files have been wiped. The MAC even talks to me. I'll tell it to hop it, but it remains resolutely on my desk. It is big, ugly and grey weighs like an unforgivable sin and disturbs the calm with the whirring of the fan. I understand hammers. They hammer in nails. Some hammers have a claw end, this is useful for pulling out old nails. I like the hammer. I know what it does and why it does it. Hammer in the morning... Hammer in the evening...  The web. The net. Abstract entities. Fisherman and his friend, the Fisherman's friend, use their net for a purpose. They catch fish for consumption. That is what fishermen and their friends do. Their net serves a purpose, it is real, when you pull it out of the sea it is dripping wet, the rope scores your hands. I understand nets. They receive the football, contain beautiful legs, and are an integral part of Wimbledon. I confess to not understanding net-curtains. Burning books is considered anti-intellectual, but I cannot find anything anti-intellectual with burning net-curtains. Amnesty international is pleading with house owners to release their net-curtains without further delay. Reason being, their horrendous capacity to block light, create exclusion and hide the private. Say NO to drugs! Say NO to net-curtains!  The purpose of my blog? It is a diary. Bringing the private into the public. Recording that which is often left unsaid, publishing those thoughts that Political correctness labels as non-thoughts. Confront the taboo. Look at the controversial. Speak the mind. APS is crap. Food is over prized. Celebrities poo. Bureaucrats are a hinderence. Life is full of contradictions. I ramble.  Blogging off.
