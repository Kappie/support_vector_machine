Good for you.  If you don't, well I'll tell you.  It's basically a website to buy pictures of sports events my Dad takes pictures of.  Currently I'm working for him getting pictures uploaded when people request things from the archive... so yeah that's what I'm doing.  Fun stuff.  Watched the Laker game today.  It was a good one.  Lakers were down by as much as 16 in the 2nd.  Lakers came back while Tim Duncan was in foul trouble.  Too bad for the Spurs, the Lakers are back!  Hahah.  But the next game is in San Antonio at 8:30 on Tuesday.  The Lakers are yet to win a game in San Antonio, so it should be a good game.  Go Lakers.  Other than that, mostly... I haven't been up to much.  Peace.   Listening to: Linkin Park - "KYUR4 TH ICH"
