Very few errors and a few unexpected comedic events made tonight's opener teh shiznit. fo sheezy. (pardon the gibberesh. there are no english words good enough to describe tonight).   After that, we went to Perkins. It was ok, too many loud freshman though. All the upperclassmen kept telling them to shut up, and they would listen to us and shut up for about 5 seconds, then start again. Damn freshman. Well, seeing as how it is now 12:19, I shall go.   Actually, no. Scrap that. I shall leave you with... A SONG!! Look in the next entry for it.  (edit: I forgot to put up a song.. I must have fallen asleep or something.. sorry.. i put a snippet of one up there to make up for it)
