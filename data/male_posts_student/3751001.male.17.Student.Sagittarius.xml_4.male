Hopefully next week i'll be going to Nottingham with Vix and maybe some others, i'm also awaiting the return of Jonny from Italy so i can begin my "mission" *winks*. When i'm bored i become very moody and take it out on others, normally its Riktard but because he's on holiday (hes Jonny's brother) i've been lashing out at random people for no apparent reason, and i don't like what i do :-(. There is another thing troubling me at the moment - love - a concept i've had little experience with in my near 18 years on this planet. Alot of people i know are finding people and are happily in love and until now i've wondered whats the fuss with the opposite sex. I DO like someone, i really do like this person i'm sure most of you can guess if you know me including her. They is several main reasons for liking her; shes patient and understanding, she's beautiful and most importantly i can trust her which is rare for anyone in this world.  She knows who she is.... I love her.  ~Atrocity
