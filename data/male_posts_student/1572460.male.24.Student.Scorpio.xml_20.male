Its been a long time since I have picked a book and voraciously devoured half of it in one go. Not that its of biblical proportions anyways. But just for the record,  urlLink Fountainhead , for me, holds the dubious distinction of being the book with the least number of pages to have been read in the first sitting - I dozed off after the introduction/preface, cursing  urlLink Ayn Rand . On the other hand, I might also hold the rare distinction (c'mon, not  exactly  dubious this time) of actually finishing that 700-odd page epic after three months of diligent reading, and inspite of cursing the author initially.  Getting back to the mockingbird, I don't know why I am reading this at the age of 24. On second thoughts, I wouldn't have understood much of it in my teens anyways, although as it has always happened with me and my books, most people seem to have read it long back, making me wonder if my reading abilities in my teens were ordinary or what.  If ever writing could be subtle yet so powerful, that too using real-world, almost everyday characters, then MockingBird should be a classic example. This is really a literature masterpiece. Post-mockingbird, I have already set my eyes on welcoming the new year with  urlLink Catcher in the Rye  and  urlLink Catch 22 , two books which people are known to go ga-ga about.   2003 has been a great year for me considering I managed to do some big reading. Fountainhead,  urlLink Shreeman Yogi  (which is simply a must, must Marathi read; all of 1100-odd pages, my longest one ever and took me a whopping 6 months to finish), and lots others. I also have another Marathi book,  urlLink Panipat , waiting on my bookshelf to be picked up. Then there's  urlLink Douglas Adams ,  urlLink Aldous Huxley ,  urlLink Existentialism ...the saga should continue...welcome 2004!
