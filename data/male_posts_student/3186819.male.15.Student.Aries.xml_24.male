I think everyone should have 1 (or 2) flex days per school week, where you can take it off whenever. Or you could "bank" your flex days and take a week off! Oh well. So I spent the day reformatting (for you non-technologically endowed folks, thats erasing everything from a hard drive) and installing. So first I install Mandrake Linux 9.2. All's well. I install Windows 98 and alls well. Same with 2000, and then XP. Low and behold what does XP do? It decides it wants to ERASE Linux. Theres 30 minutes of Linux time wasted. Does Microsoft really hate Linux that much that XP erases it? Talk about taking a grudge too far. So now I am updating XP and what not. After this, I will be installing all of XP's applications (Word, games, etc). Then I will install Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition, just for shits and giggles. AND THEN I have to install Linux AGAIN (4th time in the past 3 days).   Now only Linux people will understand the next part...  Stupid LILO is being a bitch. It shows soo many entries when I want to start my computer. It has:  linux failsafe windows windows2 floppy old_windows old_windows2  AND ITS DRIVING ME NUTS! I went into the lilo.conf file in the /etc/ folder and edited out the floppy, windows, windows 2, old windows 2 and failsafe (cause old_windows is what takes me to my Microsoft boot selector that asks me Windows 98, 2000, XP, Server 2K3). But nonetheless they STILL show up. LILO is driving me insane. A short trip all the same, but still. DAMN YOU LILO. DAMN YOU TO THE DEPTHS OF LINUX HELL FROM WENCE YOU CAME!  In the end, for me the endless question for Linux or Windows? BOTH! Why restrict to one? Linux is awesome, Microsoft is compatible. If only all the Windows programs worked in Linux.......Oh well.  By the way, I am taking another "flex day" tomorrow (well, by the time someone reads this, today). I gotta clean the house because me mammy might be out of L'hopital tomorrow (today).
