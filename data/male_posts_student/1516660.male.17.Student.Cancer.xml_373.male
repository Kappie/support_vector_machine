With lotsa pairings, Ginny/Draco is the main one. Wow. I love that pairing. HaHa! I am turning into a Ginny/Draco shipper too! HaHa! I am now currently enjoying Harry/Draco and Ginny/Draco. Well, anything with Draco in it is fun. He's such a great character to work with in slash and ships. He's quite versatile. I like him, even though he's an evil git in the canon, doesn't mean he's one in fandom. :P Heh.   One fic I wouldn't approve is Snape slash/pairings. Ergh! Somehow, I can't imagine Snape in any kind of relationship. It's like...ergh. Ha. *Shudders*  I've turned into a fanfic person all of a sudden! Ha! I am always engrossed in a fic. I am reading one right now, that almost all of the MNIers are saying it's good.  urlLink The Lodger  by Mad Martha. Ha!   I will complete this fast la. Yes. Today I completed the PoA game! Weee! Such a fun game! The Demontor attack was really hard...but phew, I managed to scrape past. HaHa!   Yes. After that were more fic. I was immersed in this series, The Wildest Dreams. I stopped after Number 3, a Snape pairing. That turned me off Snape pairings forever. HaHa! Ewwww.... Also, I was reading  urlLink A World Without , an AU where Harry and gang is totally Muggle. Of course, this is a H/D slash.   Yes. I brought dinner. I then went to make a some worksheets for today's tuition. I am tutoring my brother Chem. I am teaching Kinetic Energy today. Lets see how it turns out.  Well. Firstly, his chem teacher sucks. You know what he wrote for "Using Kinetic Theory, explain why is the fuel used in car a liquid?"? He wrote "because the liquid can dissolve and give power to the car" and it was actually marked right!! I was so shocked and surprised!! Such a teacher exists!!   Well, I taught him. He got the basic concepts. He needs more work though, but it's quite remarkable, comparing to what he wrote in the test. He did the worksheet, I corrected it and made him do corrections. Hmm. He better show Mr Lim what I've done. He has been chastising me to teach my brother. I hate it when he does it you know. Use that "brothers relationship" to force me to do things. I would do it one lor. No need to force. When I'm forced, I tend not to do things, even though I like/want to do them. I'll tell him on Tuesday. Sigh. I enjoy teaching.   Yes. I am now waiting to download Forca by Nelly Furtado! Such a nice song. Yes! Unfortunately, I am at number 29 in the queue list. Pathetic.   Right. I should be off reading The Lodger now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
