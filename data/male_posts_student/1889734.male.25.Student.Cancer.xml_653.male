The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling that thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself."   .... John Stuart Mill.  I'm reading the two accounts of families losing people in the war in the past week (on the Drudge page as of this morning), and I have mixed feelings.  Of course it's tragic that this is going on, and these families are losing people.  I have no immediate family in theater, so it is hard for me to truly place myself in that situation and understand what it's like.  But I don't think that can change the fact that this is worth doing.  Not idividually, not to each person involved, but in the larger picture, it is worth it.  That is an unfortunate fact of nations - while we strive to seek individualism, there are a few endeavors that require a group mentality.  War is one of them.  Everyone who puts on the uniform should have a complete understanding of what that means.  Many see it as a path to college, or a relatively prestigious career with little risk in a peaceful world.  When things change, these risks are a consequence of serving in the military.  Of course, it is essential that we can trust that our leadership is using the military in an appropriate fashion, but they MUST be free to use the military when the time comes.  If we left it to every parent of a soldier, then there would be very little war.  No one WANTS to see thier kids fight and die, but sometimes it is required.  I saw Bush on TV last night, and it struck me how old he looks.  Hollow skin around the neck, white hair, and a face as lined as a rumpled sheet.  He looked about 120 years old, and I recalled thinking he looked too young during the 2000 election.  My houseguest last night exclaimed that BUsh should be sent to Iraq with nothing more than a non-functional pellet gun, as he was a heartless bastard.  I didn't bother commenting on the foolishness.  I'm certain every president who has ever had to order the death of a 19 year old soldier has felt it deeply.  But they gave that order, and we are a better nation because of it.  The best thing we can do for those serving over there is to stand firm, and make it clear to the leadership that we expect them to take the gloves off and fight as they are capable of fighting.  We want them home, but we want the job finished.  The slow, steady drip of casualties stems from the desire to limit the conflict, save 'civilian' lives and to keep the world liking us.  I think it's more important we save our own people by letting them do what they do so well.  Victory, low casualties, and quick resolution: pick two.
