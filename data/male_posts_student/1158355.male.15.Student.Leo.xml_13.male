They're in 8th... anyways we begged Keith and Steve to come and they said they wouldn't but ended up coming with us. Angelica kept making excuses that she was scared... ya know. I took a piece of food and threw it at this little 7th grade girl who wouldn't stop screaming. I threw it behind me, then I hear AHHH! MY EYE! I think her name was Gabby from Dawnwood, says Angelica. After the movies we went to Friendly's but they were too crowded and had to wait about an hour to get a seat so we went to Mcdonald's. I ate alot... fries were thrown... ya. I went back to Matt's and Keith and Steve had to go home. We watched Born Identity which is pretty good, ok how does Matt Damon survive in the water so long? Maybe he's a robot. Matt's brother, Tom had his friend sleep over also. We watched skating videos and played Metroid and 007 Nightfire. We also snowboarded outside and went into war with each other. Bryan kept acting like JFK... pretty funny. Ok these journal things are pointless!
