But just in case... if you're in 6th period, or the other AP period, I hope you remember the Holocaust/Hiroshima discussions we had.  I came across a story in the New York Times about a village in Italy attempting to prosecute some former Nazi SS members.  If this piques your interest, you can read the story here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th .  The question it asks is, is the world ready to forgive the Nazis?  Because Sant'Anna Italy isn't ready to forget it.  Post your thoughts about this, the draft, or your mother's snickerdoodle recipe, but say SOMETHING!  Love, Rob
