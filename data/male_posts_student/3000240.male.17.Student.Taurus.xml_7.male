There's other far more interesting and important schools of thought to consider i.e. breathing.   Anyhow, I'm also finding out how wrong I was as I found for yet another "overslept" excuse given to my old decrepit excuse for parents, for me not turning up to college yet again. Oh well This seems to affect my college work (I am infact a self-confessed lazy asshole) and I fail to hardly do any work which means I have to work outside the confides of the college, as I recently got god awful mock exam marks in both sociology and psychology, and as for philosophy . . . Well I haven't even done it yet gulps. Well I feel kind of null anyway not just because of the sleep; I just really miss my friends like Anna I guess and a whole load of other issues which, most probably are left deep in my subconscious somewhere.  I had my nephew over today, and he was being an obnoxious fucker as usual, so I stuck him in the oven and cooked him (lol only joking), but it's been a boring day nether the less. Mum is annoyed at me again, I guess her ego got bruised again or something, no idea why though. Anyhoo meh i'm bored. So 'm gunna try to define youth into strict categories later. Keep my mind sane . . . xBuBzx
