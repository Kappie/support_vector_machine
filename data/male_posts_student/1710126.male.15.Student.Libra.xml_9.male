The producers put Yehenara (empress Ci Xi) in a totally different light...very successfully rendered. The girls behind me were lyk giggling when hosen leong appeared b4 he even said anything...one of the songs hav veri nice lyrics, everyone was lyk tokking abt it during intermmission  quote  "like sons need their mothers,  like rivers need the seas, like winter nights need fire, like temples need a shrine, like lovers need desire, like prophets need a sign"   Go Kit Chan Go!
