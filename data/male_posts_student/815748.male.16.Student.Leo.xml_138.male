Here's the story:  Because of my trip to France, two of the graded assignments this term were not counted in my score, since I wasn't there to do them.  Since there are never very many assignments in math, that left only one significant grade left, a test, which accounts for five-sixths of my term grade.  On this test, I got a 6.7 out of ten, or 67%.  The reason for every one of my errors stemmed from a theorem I had written down wrong, the Problem 12 Theorem.  You know how much I wrote down wrong?  One sign.  I wrote a plus instead of a minus.  And you know why I wrote it down at all?  Mr. Stanley gave us a sheet of theorems to use during the test.  Since we had gone over the Problem 12 Theorem the previous week, I asked why it wasn't on the sheet.  He said I could add it.  I then asked him if I had written it down correctly; it was a reasonable question since he admitted implicitly that we ought to have been given it anyway.  And get this: he said yes.  Because this test grade counts for five-sixths of my term grade, right now I'm getting a C third term.  Without a B every term, I cannot get into honors next year.  When I complained about my test grade, Mr. Stanley said I could come early tomorrow to talk about it with him.  Oh, I'll talk about it alright.  Plenty of words will come out of my mouth.  And some of them might have four letters, too.
