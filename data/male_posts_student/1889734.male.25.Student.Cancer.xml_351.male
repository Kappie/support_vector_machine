I'm surprised at how quickly NASA is moving in reorganizing and changing mission priorities after the Bush declaration.  I really thought it would take many months before we saw any hard news come out.  While I'm sad to see Hubble go, I think this is the right decision.  Changing our focus and getting us to become a more routine space-faring people will enhance future Hubble-like missions.  The possibilities of what can be done will increase dramatically, and building a massive observatory on the dar side of the moon will be within reach in 20-30 years.  If getting that requires the sacrifice of Hubble, then so be it.  Actually, this isn't so much a sacrifice as it is a return to the original mission timeline.  Hubble has exceeded it's life design, and we've certainly got our money back on the amount of science it has generated.  It would have been nice to bring it back down and install it in the Smithsonian, but that wasn't possible even before the Columbia accident.  I'm still waiting to hear how the rest of the observatory projects are going to fare.  Probably not well, considering they have no direct impact on the human missions.  There were some exciting things coming up, and I hope that one day they get their launch.    The interferometer missions were the most promising.  Using many smaller space telescopes, flying in formation, scientists would be able to use interferemetry to add the light signals together to create a virtual telescope the size of the separation distance between the smaller scopes.  The principle is used in Radio Telescopes on Earth.  Scopes on opposite sides of Earth can link together and make a telescope the size of the entire planet.    With a long based interferometric scope, it would have been possible to actually take photographs of planets orbiting other stars.  The Planet Imager was just such a project, along with the Terrestrial Planet Finder mission.  Both of these scopes would have allowed for spectrophotometric analysis of planetary atmospheres from light years away.  These missions are as close as we are going to get to actually going there.  Hopefully, as we gain the technological know-how and increasing access to space, those missions will be launched.
