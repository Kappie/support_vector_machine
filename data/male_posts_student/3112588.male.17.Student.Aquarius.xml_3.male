MIKE SHADDLE LoL i forgot that he worked there, and after i had told him 5 hrs before that i didn't shop at Hollister LoL!! how dumb am i? so we talked and had a conversation while i waited for the parental, and he's a pretty nice guy. today, im planning on relaxing and punishing myself by sitting down and forcing myself to finish "Grapes of Wrath", b/c i have a test on it on Monday, and a 5 pg essay due on Friday (yeah, right-barely read the book to begin with), and i have to buy "Inventions of Moral", some book to get into AP English, and then read the AP European History packet for the test coming up soon. so, i should get some sleep. night.
