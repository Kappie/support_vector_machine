(I make it sound like someone died.)  I've got some plans for "michael." coming up.  New layout and I'm thinking about my own personal forum (bbs) for it.  Halbe.org then would be more geared for my family and michael., my site more geared to whatever I'm doing.. I like it's always been.  So that's about all I have to say.  I'm tired.  Night.
