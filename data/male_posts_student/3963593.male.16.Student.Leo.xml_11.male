If not, I have decided that I will declare myself a failure at being a guy. This doesn't mean I'm gonna turn gay, or totally give up, just that I won't be happy with myself. Right now I'm not even sure who I have a chance with, or who exactly I would like to have as a girlfriend, I guess it's kind of one of those "I'll know when it happens" kind of things. I really like Jessee, but I think all I've really got with her is a friendship. Each time I see her she looks better, and I really like her company, she actually listens or at least pretends to listen to what I have to say. Sometimes I feel like I would like to go to the next level with her, and I sometimes think of what it would be like, but I've decided that it would probably never happen for a few reasons:  1. I'm too shy around her and other girls, although after a while I open up, but it doesn't do much for first impressions  2. I'm not catholic  3. Our personalities are different, not worlds apart, but not dead on matches  4... Well... I can't really think of other reasons, but I know that they are there, I just can't think of it.  I'm gonna keep having fun with her, or at least I plan on it, and I'm gonna do my best to stay in the game, and fulfill my resolution as a junior. I have a car, I have a good chance of making the varsity football team, I make good grades, and Monica says I'm a gentleman (I'll take her word for it). Nothing's stopping me besides myself, wish me luck.
