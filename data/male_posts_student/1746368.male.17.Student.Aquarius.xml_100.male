We can not just take this sitting down. We must take some action. I will be waiting online for most of the day tomorrow. Hopefully we can get all four of us on at once.   Romans 8:35  "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship r persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?"  Who will separate us? Will it be him? I know he can't separate me from the love of Christ.  Philippians 4:6 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."  Pray for this guy guys. He cannot do anything to us but we can do a lot to him. We have the chance to change this guy from a Saul to a Paul. Just pray.  Philippians 4:13 "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."  This is living proof that we can do anything. God has enabled us, he has given us authority over hell and hell's demons. We can do this.  Contact me (whether through email:  urlLink sk8n4christ@hotmail.com  or AIM; which you guys have) and tell me the best time for you to meet with everyone else. If you can, try to remember to tell me if you mean EST or PST. Thank you for reading this all guys.
