I've got a few grand in the bank, but since I don't have a job, I'm saving as much money as I can; I do have to pay for school, gas, bills and food. Ah well, such are the perils of a student and one who is having a hard time finding a job right now.  In addition, there's been a definite lack of quality games being released lately. Games like likes of Halo, Half-Life, Deus Ex, System Shock 2 and Max Payne (which define genres) are few and far between. The next two likely candidates to join their ranks are Halo 2, Doom 3 and Half-Life 2; these are all due out later this year, but there hasn't been anything else even worth trying out lately. So what's a gamer to do? And don't forget a broke gamer...  If you're me, you revert to your roots... I pulled out my PlayStation games, plus my NES and SNES. Yes, I still own them, and almost all of the games I ever owned for all systems. (Some, once beaten, were sold at garage sales long ago.) I decided to start with the NES, playing through and re-enjoying classics such as Final Fantasy, ExciteBike, Zelda, Mike Tyson's PunchOut!, Contra, Metal Gear, and Castlevania.  ** Side story: I can't avoid mentioning this after bringing up Final Fantasy; such are the memories that awaken. When I lived in Virginia, my best friend (Ryan Mangels) and I used to sleep over at each other's homes on weekends and during the summer, and play NES (and later SNES) games until the wee hours of the morning. In Final Fantasy, there was a monster called WarMech that only appeared in one small section of a map, exactly 15 spaces long. And each time you stepped on one of these spaces, you had something like a 1 in 600 chance of meeting it. Nintendo Power (yes, I was a yearly subscriber) had a contest after the game came out: if you met WarMech, took a photo and mailed it in, you were entered and had a chance to win a live Final Fantasy adventure, hosted by Square and Nintendo. Well, on October 31 around 11 at night, we finally met WarMech; Ryan paused the game, while I ran upstairs from my basement to get my mother's camera. We took a few pictures of the screen, and then started to read how to send it in... Turn out the contest ended October 31 - we lost out. But I kept the pictures, and taped one of them to the underside of my Final Fantasy cartridge. Everytime I break it out, I always look back on those good times. I miss those days, don't you, Ryan? Oh yeah, and our characters got raped by WarMech, too. We had to restart from a save, and re-do the Tower of Wind. Yay. **  One of my many regrets is that my mother sold my Atari 5200 and games at a garage sale many years before. (My uncle worked for Atari once upon a time, and got me the system and ALL games for it one Christmas...) Pole Position, Asteroids, Missle Commander, Dig Dug and more... All gone. :(  The SNES holds many more games, as well as memories. Final Fantasy II and III (the best of the series, EVER), Zelda 3, Mario Kart, ChronoTrigger and F-Zero remain among some of the best over-all console games ever created, even to this day. Those of you questioning this comment need to realize that flashy graphics don't make games better - story and characters do. If you doubt me, play Final Fantasy 3; these characters have virtues and faults, and the villian (Kefka) is pure EVIL. I'd write a dissertation on this, but a wise young man named Brian Clevinger has already done so. You can read it  urlLink here . While you're there, check out his sprite comic, 8-bit Theater; it's base comedy at its purest.  I've also gone through my PlayStation games; Final Fantasy 7, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat 3, and the revisions of Final Fantasy I and II (Japan) are classics that cannot be avoided.  My point? Damned if I know. I guess I just love pointing out that the gamers today have no idea what REAL games are, and are missing out on some of the best games ever created. You don't need flashy summoning scenes, FMV sequences or multiple DVD-disc games to have fun; you just need the right games, which aren't often made anymore. If any of you young gamers are reading this, go to E-Bay or GameStop; pick up a used NES or SNES and some classic games... You'll have some of the best fun in your young lives and see what crap game designers are passing off on you today. And for the older gamers, if you've still got your systems, break them out. Memories of days past are lurking, and they want out. You won't regret it. Me? I'm already hitting up E-Bay for old games I've lost or sold.
