This is, of course, down to my stupidity and not my connection speed, as that is a beautiful 256Kbs (although, Blue Yonder is apparently going to update it to 512kbs with no extra cost to myself, which I find rather strange). At this time i'm sitting in a hybrid-yoga postion (i.e. Randomly) in my light-blue jeans (the one's brought on my first shopping trip with my fashion guru Beena) and a rather disgusting Donnay top. I would usually be wearing some tight-fitting (too small) camouflage t-shirt with a "69" printed onto it, but because of the college Induction day on Friday I'm saving up on clothing options - I am SO gay!! Had my hair cut yesterday, love the colour and everything, but still think it looks to short on the top, at the moment I could swear it looks like bum-fluff because it hasn't got any gel in. Additionally, these are two of the most important websites ever. They are the home sites of the band that I helped to set-up, and am actively interested in re-joining as a 'groupee'. The better of the two sites is quite obviously Elliott's at,  urlLink Without Emily , the first website was made by myself and lacks the sophistication and general grandeur of Elliott's site (I put this entirely down to it being made through AOL, although i do have to admit to knowing less about HTML code than a kangaroo on speed...) and can be found through the bands old name,  urlLink The Country Hobo's . Please visit these sites as they are intensly hilarious and the band are pretty sharp too :P. Anyway, I'm not sure if this is the kinda thing you're supposed to write in these things, so i'm going to run off now to try and make a profile and then search through the site to see how these things are supposed to look! Until then, Have Fun! Marin J.
