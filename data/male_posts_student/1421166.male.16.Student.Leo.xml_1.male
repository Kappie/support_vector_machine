I feel fit now...haha! But I'm suppose to do this thrice a week, I think i'll just die...oops...won't la. Then only very little homework again. So hope I'll write in my journal. Then today like quite happy =), I think cause handed in all my homework and didn't get scolded. Just now went to my jie's blog, she asked how am I...hehe...I'm fine jie!!!How about you!!!...hehe...ok...hope to see her again soon. There was Physics Class Test just now...argh...didn't study. But funny i knew what to say, I think maybe i just wrote crap. And tried to make a tag board...I'm a failure, cause it spoils the whole page, so I did away with it. There's "Bachelor" on tonight. Used to like watching it, but after reading "I kissed dating goodbye" by Joshua Harris, decided that it suggested the world's view on "love" based on feelings, better known as passionate lust. So no way I'm watching it, cause there's a subtle influence. Ya, Lord guide me! Yeah...ok...better be off...You can contact me at han48seeker@hotmail.com
