Friday and Saturday, I will be at the Chicago Inter-Continental Hotel for the Chicago Auto Show. Which totally ROCKS! So anyway Jonah, Charissa and I will be there Thursday Night.  Also Bingbing Chu? Really?  And Erin I'm sorry for the first line, I said it in jest, please don't hurt me.   The vegetable must be destroyed!
