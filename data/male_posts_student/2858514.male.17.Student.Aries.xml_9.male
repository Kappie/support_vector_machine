Today I've finished 1 chapter, which introduces the STL(Standard Template Library). STL is very powerful, the major data structures and algotithms are implemented in it, so programmer can use them instantly. But since C++ is too powerful, it is very hard to write. Mistakes can be easily made, and hard to track. Also pointers make me feel dizzy! Well, it may be better for me to concentrate on C#. And I'm just a programming newbie, though.  I don't why today I feel very sleepy, may be I play too much computer or my holiday is too boring...  Just tried the client callback feature in ASP.NET 2.0, it's very fantastic! So calling server-side code need not postback any more!
