But what really made my sock creep out of my shoe was this thing about me being more of an Introvert. Yack! It's creepy. Hello? I am an extravert (not extrovert....they're different)! People of the world, I am like so sociable and friendly. Heller?!   Just look at this. What's the point of this blog spot here proving that I need social interaction, that I am not some dreamy boy reflecting about the depth of life.  But anyway, it really sucks knowing something about yourself that you never knew quite well existed. But its acceptance people, just a bit of acceptance, and I am well over this "in-denial-syndrome."
