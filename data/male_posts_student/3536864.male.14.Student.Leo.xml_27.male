I had the big chicken all you can eat thing, but i didn't have anything for breakfast so the rfried beans didn't taste all too apetizing. During the middle of the meal the electricity blinked and of course Genny's(friend from texas) little sister(obviously little sister of friend from texas...and she also lives in texas..go figure) decided to scream a bit along with some other friend's son who is only three. After we sort of ate the food, Genny's drink was taken away by the waitress so she could get a refill. However, we believe that the waitress either didn't like us because we insulted the food, or the syrup had drained down to the bottom of the drink. Either way, it tasted nasty. Following that episode we decided to  go and see if we could try our luck at the arcade.  However...we need money. One of us obtains a large bill (not to large) and puts it all into tokens. I being the only one with pockets large enough to hold 108 tokens was left with the majority of the bounty. I'm likin' this, a cargo pocket full of tokens i didn't even pay for, and ski ball and cruising the usa at my fingertips. Muhaha! I exercised my will power however, and shared the tokens that weren't even mine. We watch the little ones while at the same time ski-balling and racing. This is great. Ahh! now the storms. We had great storms with some nice thunder. The little ones have now scattered so Genny and I go on a racing spree. She testifies that she won most of the time, but I, being the male, flatly deny that claim. I had the coolest crashes anyway. And I beat her plenty of times. Anyways...We probably blew around 25 tokens on that alone. And we raced for probably half an hour. We did all the courses. And two different cars. The humvee and the jeep. Cause all the other cars are wimpy. My little brother accidentally chose manual, that was fun. I had to dodge and maneuver five car pile ups and big trees (even tho you could run over them anyway) with one hand while shifting. That's talent. Did some more ski ball, and then we had a very small number of tokens left. Genny and I raced once again and i won once and she won once. This one kid got boochoos of tickets in some gambling game. He must have gotten 250 tickets. With no tokens and with nothing else to do, we had to get creative. In this case, it had great potential. You see, My friend's little sister (see above) had a little toy frog that was perfect for shooting at people. So Genny and her cousin becky plotted to shoot me with it, but she couldn't figure out how to do it so there plans were shattered. So much for that....the Guatamalan assassin will need to devise something new. I also revealed the fact that one of my siblings is deathly afraid of rubber bands. All I had to do was act like i had a rubber band by holding two fingers by each other and he shrank into a corner. Amazing. Having nothing to do, and being creative as we are, we decided to go back to the tables to avoid doing something that the staff wouldn't approve of, and because there were no chairs. Once we got there though, our parents stood up and left, and we went with them. The rain was still raining, so Genny went to get her car...danger..i could feel it begin to reek in the air the moment she put her foot on the gas pedal. I jumped onto the median on the way to my car, but i still didn't fell safe. She has a 2 ton weapon, and a curb won't do me much good. She actually drove very well considering that she almost couldn't see over the steering wheel...heh, sorry, i couldn't resist. Then they drove away and we drove away...and then i made political campaign signs for the next two and a half hours. Sitting...in the same room...making signs. Ah well, at least I had a better note for the day, and that would be my visit to Casa Bonita. Ciao
