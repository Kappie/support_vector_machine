To learn, in rhythms large and small, slow and fast, how to be aggressive, to pause, or to go against your opponent's rhythm is crucial in martial arts.  In a martial combat, you must learn the rhythm of each opponent; and, with a rhythm he can't imagine, you win by creating a sophisticated rhythm out of the rhythm of the Void."  ...  "Keep your mind broad and straight; do not stretch it taut; do not allow it to grow in the least lax; do not make it lean to one side but hold it at the center; keep it quietly fluid, doing your best to maintain it in a fluid state even while it  is  fluid.  When you are quiet, your mind shouldn't be quiet; when you're moving fast, your mind shouldn't at all be moving fast.  Your mind shouldn't follow your body, nor should your body follow your mind.  Your mind must be cautious while your body is not.  Your mind should lack nothing while having no excess.  Superficially you may have your mind appear weak, but you must keep it strong inwardly, lest people can tell what you really are."  ...  "As for the two manners of seeing things,  kan  (observing) and  ken  (seeing), the eye for  kan  is strong, the eye for  ken  weak; seeing distant things as if they are close at hand and seeing close things as if they are distant is special to the art of fighting.  Knowing your opponent's sword and yet not in the least seeing it is important in the art of fighting."  ...  By knowing "the path of the sword" well, you can freely wield the sword you always carry, even with two fingers.  If you try to wield it unnaturally fast, its path becomes blocked and you can't wield it.  You must wield it as naturally as you can."  ...  "When you and your enemy are about to strike each other, your body and your mind turn into a single striking movement and your hands strike out of the void naturally, swiftly, powerfully.  This is called "no-thought, no-feature," and is of crucial importance."  ...  "'The officer knows his soldier' means this:  When the matter finally comes to battle, you face it with firm conviction that as far as what you're going to do is concerned, you have constantly studied the art of fighting and have gained a perfect knowledge of it, so that your enemy is no more than your soldier whom you can dispose of as you like and move about as you wish."  ...  "Ordinarily, the vulgar view holds that the place where things are not understood is the void.  But that is not the true Void, for there everyone remains lost.  In the art of fighting, too, if a samurai who pursues his duties doesn't know what the  law  for him is, he hasn't attained the state of void.  Someone like that will continue to be distracted in various ways and may describe something irrelevant as void, which of course is not the true Void.  If he firmly masters swordsmanship while also training hard in other martial arts; if he is not at all in the dark about what he is expected to do as a samurai and practices it, undistracted, every day and every hour; and if he polishes the two mental components of  shin , "the mind," and  i , "the will," and hones the two eyes of  kan , "observing," and  ken , "seeing," thereby reaching the place where nothing is clouded, distracting clouds having all cleared up, then the samurai will know what the true Void is."
