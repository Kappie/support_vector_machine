I'm feeling really tired right now, despite that nap I took earlier.  So there's this girl at work that nobody likes. At first I felt kind of bad that all the other girls rip on her behind her back. I've worked a few hours here and there with her before, and didn't really have any problems. However, now I sort of see why no one likes her. I fuck up here and there, but at least I try to be a part of a team.   Now playing:   urlLink Weezer   - Say It Ain't So  Speaking of people not liking people. Sometimes I wonder if I push things too much. It's something about my sick sense of humor in which I like to see how people react to things.   Now playing:   urlLink Alkaline Trio   - Crawl  I spent most of my afternoon (following my nap) uploading stuff to my new  urlLink phone . If Nikki doesn't call about doing anything tonight by 8:30, I'm hitting the gym.  10 days until Vegas, 20 days until no more work, 29 days until year 3  **
