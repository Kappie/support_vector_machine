She wouldnt let me see her room, since it was a mess, but she let me see everywhere else. So eventualy I just broke into her room :P. I had a lot of fun as I was there. I would go into more detial but a certian person she did not have a good night with last night might see and get mad or it may make things werse :-/.  Sorry last night was hell Laura, I really hope you feel bette, keep a smile on that beautiful face. Remember, im always here and always will care.  *Laura has NSYNC and BACK STREET BOY concert tickets on her door!!!! HAHAHAHAHA!    ;)  Love ya Laura ;)  *She wouldnt sing or dance for me :( ... I still want to see that c-walk. ;)
