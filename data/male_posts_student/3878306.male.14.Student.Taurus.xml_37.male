She a little expensive but music lessons is expensive. She sounds really cool and she knows to play everything and teaches various things. Anyway here are her rates: 	Musical Instruments: 	1 Hour		$35 	10 Hour	$300 	350 Hour	$350  I asked about multi learning like Violin and keyboards but I wonder if I can just learn both for one month. Now I’m hooked on it and I want to learn so badly! I hope this works out…  I’m calling Lori back at around seven.
