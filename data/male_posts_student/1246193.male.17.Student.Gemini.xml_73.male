Confirmation was tonight and it is definitely an evening that I will remember for the rest of my days.  I don't feel much different than I did before the ceremony, only more nostalgic.  I remember the days when we, as first graders, sang songs in the basement.  When Mrs. Lunk taught our P.S.R. class and gave us joy through her smile.  When Zach decided to eat his entire sunday school book, and accomplished the feat. When Sister Dominica called us "little people" while she looked up at us.  When Bob told us his interesting views on Catholic beliefs.  When Joe threw markers at people, physically attacked Brendan, broke the hands and head off of the Virgin Mary, and referred to womens' chests as "breastisies".  When we actually enjoyed Carole's class because we learned something.  And I remember our days in Erik's class, as we prepared for the Sacrament of Confirmation.  I cannot say that I have enjoyed every minute of my eleven years of P.S.R., but I will never forget them.  Nor will I forget the special bond that I have with the people whom I have spent every Sunday morning since first grade with.
