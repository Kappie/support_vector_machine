I speak no more on this subject. Well, that's a lie.  I am done with Bret. Our relationship was short but sweet. Short in a sort of "What's the square root of -1" way, and sweet like an overbearing mother.  No, my attentions have turned elsewhere. Namely, two seats to the right of Bret. Ah, William. You see, he's asian, and looks much less like a 10 year old, so I can conduct myself with more dignity now. Fanya McHeartstealer has her eyes on him too though, so I better watch that girl.  I have a very attractive 7th period English class. To start off, it is taught by the sexiest Paly teacher, bearing the exception of Mr. Bungarden. That's right, Mr. Hanmer. In my class is the adorable and sexy yet oh so very annoying Ben, and the slightly less attractive and slightly less annoying Diego. There is also some random stereotypical Korean guy with bleached hair. I try to not notice him because I don't want to admit I'm attracted to him. Kamikihara-sensei's son is in there too, but since he's unattractive and I hate him, he only is an honorable mention. Tony of what is now a Living Skills Panels legend is in there too. He's also just an honorable mention, for the same reasons too.  The freshman like me. Scratch that. They  really really  like me. It's adorable occasionally, and at other times it stands as a testament to how big an age gap three years can be. The ones who still have baby fat are just too much for me to take. Beautiful Jewish ones only continue to make me think I'm a pedophile. And they all are well-aware of my car.
