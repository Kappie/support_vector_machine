Oh, wait, I forgot... he's a  sales associate.  - Well, I am back, not only in person, but as of now in consciousness from Georgia Officer Training (GOT). I sent in an application for getting in the  urlLink tech team.  This doesn't officially make me a nerd, I tell you. LOL. Actually, I'll be the only Mac guy apparently. - John Kerry selected John Edwards as his vice president. "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all..." - I've been noticing no comments lately. You  do  know you don't need a Blogger account. You can "post anonymously" and write in your name. Unlike some services... you know who you are and better be glad I like you enough to sign up for spam from Xa.... never mind. - I have been procrastinating long enough. I need to do my AP work  now.  3 books to read, 13 chapters in text books, and 3 papers. Yikes! - State Congress is coming up. I know I won't master, but who cares. LOL
