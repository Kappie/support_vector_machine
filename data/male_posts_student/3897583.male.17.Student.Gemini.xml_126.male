Round II Question 1: Write a program to make an asterisks bounce on the screen such that it moves with variable velocity. The asterisks should increase velocity on hitting the edges. Also the initial acceleration and initial velocity should be user input. Question 2: Make an analog clock with least count=1 second(using graphics complete with hour hand, minutes hand and the seconds hand)
