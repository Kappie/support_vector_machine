On his stay at the hospital much more was discovered than the most astute way to heal and rehabilitate his fractured hip. Apparently Papa has had a series of small strokes over the last while and is suffering from Parkinson's disease in his twighlight years. This is compounded by his diabetes which he has suffered from for all of his life.  Now here is the dilemma I face. I live almost 4000 kms away from my Papa, and see him as often as I can, but certainly not as often as I would like. So how do I engage with him even more now and make the most out of the decreasing time that we have left together?  How do I express my faith to him in a way that moves him and touches his heart? How do I support my family (mom, dad, brothers and sister) while being so far away from them? Do I start to engage in the fact that Papa could die soon or is that fatalistic? Is it even realistic to expect death soon when I believe and live for a God who does miracles? So many unanswered questions.  I've spent the last 4 days with the family of my beloved Jenny. It's been an intense experience for me as their family is so different from my own. Her dad is a pastor and someone I have always looked up to as a mentor in my own life. For 10 years I have known Pastor Rick and his family as role models and beloved people to me. I look at the way he and his wife interact as my example (not solely, but primarily) as a healthy example of marriage. They interact with me and their own children in a way that is so foreign to me that I find it envigorating and frustrating all at the same time. They (we) do things together as a family and this concept speaks volumes to me, and makes me extremely uncomfortable as well. I was raised by wonderful parents, but we didn't spend hours at a time sitting together, playing together, eating together, walking together. All these different perspectives on family have influenced my thought on my particular familial situation at the moment too.  I think of potentially the times that could have been if my family spent the time together that the Rick, Jan, Randy, Bryan and Jenny do. At the same time my family can have a hard enough time getting along without a lot of added time together. I don't know really. I'm not drawing all these circumstances and events into one conclusive thought really at this moment, just reflecting on the actuallity of the events. Using my blog as a sounding board as it were.  So what to do? Well I suppose I will do what I always do. Live life. Love the best I can all those around me. Trust that God is sovereign and ever seek to let Him do His work in my life as I live on. My life will change (eg. as it has with the recent "family visits" and the Papa situation) and my life will continue as long as God sees fit, so spending that life in His presence seems like as good as it could ever possibly be, all bad news aside.  Shalom.  Rooster
