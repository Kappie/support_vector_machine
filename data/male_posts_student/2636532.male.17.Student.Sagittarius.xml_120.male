So there I am at my friend's house being all sick like I have for the past few days and I assume she got fed up with my constant nose blowing and sniffing. Eventually she offered me some medicine for it, Tylonol Sinus it was, and me being me how could I refuse magic pills that will make me feel better? So I took them...I started feeling a little tired a bit down the line, and found it hard to keep my eyes open. It was about this time that she asked me if I was feeling tired at all, of course I was, and she told me she just realized she had given me the nighttime tylonol. So there I was, trying to stay awake fighting the drugs that are trying to put me to sleep. It was difficult I have to say, but I made it...I think. But all I can think about right now is that I tried to help her out of the goodness of my heart, without getting anything out of this and she repayed me by drugging me! The nerve of people! -Matt
