I really like the font, Can't remember what it is though :/ I gonna start the banner and then the ads plus the 88x31 buttons like the ones I'd done for DL. Wonder what name to use, BlackGhostStudios is kinda long... maybe just Black Ghost...  Well on another note, most of the components for the PC has arrived. Just the Gainward geforce 6800GT *Golden Sample* hasn't arrived yet. The manufacter don't know when they can get the board produced and sent to us, LOL cos its so rare. So, the ppl at XFX are ever better at selling rare graphics cards. The Geforce 6800 Ultra Ultimate Edition (LOL @ the name already) is so rare that potenial buyers must enter into a ballot to be drawn to even buy the card...  at an cost of $600  X-D     -=ROFLMAO=-  Only 100 cards have ever been sold. Its only ever faster than the normal 6800 ultra in extreme situations, like Far Cry 1600x1200, ultra high settings, 4x antialiasing 8x anistrophic filtering and Unreal II 3200x2400 (LOLOL @ that res) max details and 4XAA and 8x AF. But its $100 more expensive.  I also have a 486 chip and 16MB EDO memory stick in my bedroom randomly, and I compared it to the opteron 64 242 and a 1GB ECC DDR PC4000 stick. 10 years of technology side by side... Not much difference in terms of shape and colour and stuff...:/     Jamie   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
