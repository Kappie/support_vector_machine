I spent most of my time on the 20 MCQ qns, leaving me with no time to do the 10-marks worth structured questions! Ergh!! Stupid la! Hmm...in the afternoon, we were spent doing PW proposal. HaHa! I made CQ and Gloria wait for me...heh heh. Actually, I told them not to wait when I realized that I am not gonna go off early. Yeah. We actually scanned in the proposal form and then typed words in there. Crazy us! But we loved our final result a lot! HaHa! Great job to us all!  Okay. Sat morning we had a Maths Lecture tests. Things were not looking good here, sweetie. After the test, we went to so many places, including Ten Mile Junction. HaHa. We found a $5 note in the rubbish bin, and WQ actually picked it up. Okay. I got hold of the note eventually. HaHa. We pledged to donate that to some organization we happen to chance upon later. They went to Woodlands Stadium to train their running. I was the Timer. HaHa. After the training, we went to eat at Causeway Point. Hmm. I donated that note to a person collecting donations for the Children's Society. According to Gloria, the guy's expression was really shocked (I didn't see, coz i was too busy slotting in that note, and he is so tall). HaHa!   We went back home. I went back with an additional item. CQ's EZ-Link Card. HaHa! Yeah. We are supposed to go for the class BBQ. We are meeting GekLing at Clementi  to get to Debra's condo. Yeah. I was so tired that I slept that afternoon. For an hour though. Then I went online and after that, watched my taped Pokemon.   Yeah. I met CQ at the Marsiling station, then we went to Clementi lor. I was reading my newly-brought Charmed book, Inherit A Witch. Yeah. We saw Meng Hau and gang at the platform. What luck. That MH is a laughing stock! He has absolutely no fashion sense at all! His skin-tight pants doesn't suit him, neither does his tiny little bag. A big-sized person like him with such a small bag? Ergh...wrong picture people! He saw my book and asked if I watched Charmed. I replied yes tersely and expected some misogynist-remarks coming out of his mouth. Well, he said something like "they go around blowing people up like this (mimicks Piper)" He got the facts wrong. Not THEY. Only Piper. What an insult to Charmed! Whatever la. Crap. We met GekLing, Zahiah and Jul and got onto bus 154.  We arrived at the condo soon after. We saw Kelvin, JiaHao and Debra. The two guys were half-naked, and I thought they went swimming. It turns out that they have been feeling hot and took off their shirts. Anyhoo, we started to grill chicken wings. It's really hard work grilling them! HaHa. MCP commented "I really hand it to you guys (me adn CQ)! So good cooks! I never stepped into the kitchen, so I don't know anything about cooking". I replied sarcarstically (with low breath, but the people surrounding me can hear), "Yeah, because you didn't want to step into one. Shoosh". Kelvin laughed and said "That's why you don't support house-husbands right?"   It was sure hard work girlling chicken wings, but it is harder grilling hot dogs and crab meats. Damn. They take a long time to grill, and you can't place them on the girll itself, or else they will blackened. Yeah. It was around 7.30+ then I got to eat. John joined us then. After eating, me and CQ were like loitering around, playing card games and such. We wanted to book the pool table, but someone else have booked it liao. No pool for us. Hmm. They were also trying to dunk people into the pool. HaHa! After that, to clear the food, we played Zhong Ji Mi Ma. I kena once, and have to eat some of the really spicy stingray! Oh my lord! Hot hot hot hot!! After all the food has been gobbled, we cleaned up. Hmm. We went off at 11.   Me and CQ waited for bus 963, while the others took a different bus home. Hmmm. That MH was very naggy, saying something like "Be careful hor! Must xiao xin" and all that crap. I repled back sarcarstically "Don't worry. I won't fall down!" Such a nag. We waited quite a while for the bus to come, then even a longer while to reach Woodlands Interhchange. By that time, I've finished with my book. I reached home at 12am+. HaHa. Yah. I had fun there! :)  Okay. Today was quite okay. Huang Ah Ma finally came to persuade them to come! Oh my god! It was to touching! I was bascially tearing away for the entire episode! So touching! Okay Okay. I completed my GP essay and my Phys tutorial and my Maths homework. Hmm. Good for moi!   Die le la. Tomorrow's NAPTA. I dun think I can pass Standing Broad Jump and chin ups. Mian qiang I can pass Shuttle Run and Sit-Ups. I am so passing Sit-And-Reach. Yeah. Ayiah...why say die le la. I don't even care anyway. Shoosh.   HaHa. I just chatted with Ben. I felt it was so silly to even have fights now. So childish. So I decided to talk to him lor. Say hi. Actually, I have been considering that long ago, but only today I got so sick of my cowardice that I IMed him lor. HaHa. He was very surprised that I was talking to him. It turns out that he has been planning to resolve our differences, but like me, he don't have the guts to do anything about it. Oh well. Sometimes in life, you have to take the initiative and say hi. You will never get anything done if you keep deliberating. So yeah. HaHa. Glad to be talking to him again. Meow!  So yep. I gotta go sleep liao. TaTa! See ya next time! Night blog!
