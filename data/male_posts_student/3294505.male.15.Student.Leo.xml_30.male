Anyway, all I did was kick ass in Halo today, and enjoy the temperate afternoon. Now it's time to stay up late and start looking up tech shit on this shared blog about  urlLink tech stuff/media  betwixt me and my friend  urlLink Jonny.   Anyways, I dunno what else'll be going on right this second, so I'll probably be back later.
