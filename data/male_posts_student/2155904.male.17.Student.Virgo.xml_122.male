Don't be afraid to share the url with others so that you can let the whole world in on the 24th wonder of the world (there's got to be a lot more wonders more wondrous than this blog so that is why this is 24th).  And yeah, this blog is going to take a long time to write.  Yeah, a hella long time.  This is taking forever.  But that isn't too bad cuz it is just fueling the fire with logs to burn.  The logs are topics for conversation by the way.  Man, today was a pretty damn good Sunday.  Woke up about 10:30 but since Kinker was still here since he slept over he already had a friend over.  So that was cool.  They had a good breakfast and then played some MOH and ESPN.  For a long time.  Quite a long time.  Kinker left about 4 or so.  So they spent most of the day just hanging out and not doing anything.  Tyke made a found poem with Kink and watched some tv before he left.  And Tyke's bro came home to work on some FAFSA stuff for law school.  It's pretty cool to Tyke that his brother is going into law.  Not sure why but it makes him feel proud.  After Kink left he talked with his mom and brother about their trip to Europe and possible destinations and such.  It is fun to talk about what they are going to see and where they are going to go.  It gets him all excited.  Going to Europe.  Man, Tyke Turner in Europe.  Oh shit!  How is he going to blog when he's there?!?!?!?!!  YIKES!  Anyway, Tyke had dinner while watching the Oscars and talking about them.  Then he did a little hw and watched some tv.  His brother was leaving so they talked about school and how Tyke was not doing any work anymore and that kind of thing.  Then Dotti came over!!!  To pick Tyke up for REFUGE!!!  Yep, Tyke is now going to Refuge.  And Tina came to pick him up so they all went there and it was fun.  Tyke liked the songs and apparently they aren't even that good so that is a good sign.  And even though it is religious and Tyke has never been it is still interesting.  It makes Tyke think about everything.  And literally everything.  His life as a whole.  Which is good.  This all doesn't mean that Tyke is becoming uber-religious.  And it isn't like Tyke was ever atheist or agnostic or on either extreme.  He was just oblivious to religion really.  His only experiences with church was flipping through channels that had those sermons on them.  But those are bad.  And Tyke kinda had only that as a reference point for all of religion.  So he never really gave it a chance.  But he was always curious and intrigued.  Now he is just giving himself the chance to find things out.  He is not getting brainwashed.  He is not getting misled by the female fancy (although man would that ever work on Tyke ;).  Tyke is just searching now you could say.  Not necessarily for God but just searching to see if there is anything out there he didn't know about before that now he wants to know about.  But it is really great to get to hang out with the girls at least once on the weekend.  After refuge Tyke came home in a really good mood so he has been talking online for a long time and trying to blog but it has taken over an hour and a half so far.  It is way harder than most people think to blog.  Tyke gets sidetracked and loses his thoughts.  So it gets ramblescent.  Man, Tyke smells something really good right now.  Dr. Phil knows what it is though.  Damn that.  But Tyke needs to go to sleep now.  It is almost 11 on a Sunday night and it takes Tyke a while to sleep on Sunday since he just watches TV.  So Tyke is happy right now.  Only one thing missing from him.  And that isn't a big deal because it all comes from within anyway.  So take care.
