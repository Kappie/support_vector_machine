Her smile, voice, and her impression she left me.  There're not many of interaction between her and I.  Since when I found out that I have feeling for her, I became really awkward in front of her.  She really mature herself during those years!  When I first time I heard from Mr. Costello about her first year in USA, I was amazed how much she grow after such a short year.  She is a strong woman now.  I should be happy for her.  But I don't know, somewhere in my heart, I am sad.  I really hope she would be with me.  I don't want to leave her side, even just like a ghost and she will not notice me.  I feel really disgusted by this thought of mine.  I really did.  As long as I havd this want, I will never get close to any girl.  And I know that sad feeling is probably something else.  It's probably not even about her!  But I know, when I am sad, I think about her.  When I need comfort, I havae a need to hug somebody, that somebody is her.  Now she is back to Japan and going to work in Hilton Hotel!!  Wow!  She really made it!!  And I believe that she is going to be successful!  I just really wish that I would see her last time.  We were never close.  And I know myself well enough that she will never be interested in me.  But I don't know if you know.  My first day in High school in US, I was very afraid.  I don't show much emotion in my face, or action, but I know I am easily afraid.  I am not an audacious man, I konw that.  The first thing that really helped me get over that fear is Mr. Costello.  The second one was her.  I can never never never forget that smile on her face.  So bright, so beautiful.  I like that face.  They say all Japanese girls have that kind smile.  Maybe.  But she is the first I see, and her smile will be the last breath before I die.   As I am typing this, my heart just goes pumping, and my eyes are out of focus.  I know thatI like every girls I encouter who are pretty.  But right now she is the only one that I hug with all my strength.  It's very loathsome!  I hate myself.  I know she would graduate this year, but I still wish it could be next year.  I never told anybody this feeling.  For I don't trust them.  And I don't trust myself, if I really like her.  Or, maybe I just want to have sex, lots of sex.  But sorry, not in my imagination that she had any sex with me.  I just want to hold her, kiss her, put my face against hers.  She will never know that I like her.  And I will never know I really like her either.  I just think that I am emotionally failed.    she is gone now.  wish her best luck.  if I really love her, I should not think about her anymore.
