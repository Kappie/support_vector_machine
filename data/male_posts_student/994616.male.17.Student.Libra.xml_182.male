The woman caught him in the act when she rushed into their house to investigate a noise.  "He attempted to kill her but she managed to escape," a police spokesman said.  The man from the town of Chongwe, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Lusaka, killed himself after being admonished by other villagers.  The hen was slaughtered after the incident.
