I different and your distant, add it up and it makes no difference! Everybodys talking bout blowing up the neighborhood. Everybodys gonna break it up today. Everbodys talking bout blowing up the neighborhood, all I wanted was to get away! Stuck in America, Stuck in America! Miles in America, stuck in America (GO!) Today I change a new town with the same old face. One way to shake this place that I can't escape. Everybodys talking bout blowing up the neighborhood. Everybodys gonna watch it burn today. Everybodys talking bout waking up the neighborhood, I'm still trying to escape! Stuck in America, Stuck in America, Miles in America, Stuck in America today, today! Everybodys talking bout blowing up the neighborhood, everybodys gonna break it up today, Everybodys talkin' bout blowing up the neighborhood, All I ever wanted was to get away! Stuck in America, Stuck in America, Stuck in America, Stuck in America! Get Away (all the shit that you put me through)Get Away (all the shit that you put me through)Get Away (all the shit that you put me through)Get Away (all the shit that you put me through)Today I changed.
