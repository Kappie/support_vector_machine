Save me...      Save me...  [come on and]   Save me...  [come on and]   Will you come and save me from the mess I'm in ?      It doesnt really matter now,    Where i go.. The further from you the better they say    But I dont wanna head home       So can i come to you?   Will you hold me close  and ease the pain away ?   Maybe the fun times.. this time will last
