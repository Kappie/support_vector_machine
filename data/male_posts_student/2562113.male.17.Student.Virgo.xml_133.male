He was obviously hungover. He let us out 40 minutes early, but said he would review more for people who wanted to stay. so i stayed and joked around with lauren a bit, reviewed and left. went back to my room and took a shower. when i got out the guys wanted to go eat, so i quickly threw on some clothes and ran down to the dining hall. lunch wasn't so bad i ate fish, fries, salad, and pizza. after i went back to the room and played some holdem online, listened to music, and got dressed. had calculus from 330-430 and  right after calc i went straight to my fridge and started drinking . at around 9 i went to club 21 with christine, jackie, and some other girl from st. rose. they stayed for 5 minutes and said something about meeting up with their friend and they never came back.. supposedly the girl i didn't know was being a bitch.. jackie and christine called and apologized about their PMSing friend. whatever. i had madd fun anyway. i witnessed madd people blow. i let abby and a couple of the girls borrow one of my  mr. benjamin franklin's . it took them so long to finish, i just wanted my bill back. i was surprised to see the girls up on 21 be so much into old school video games like zelda for nintendo and almost every mario game. this one girl beat me in mario kart! wtf. a lot of people, a lot of fun. didn't smoke pot, didn't hook up with anyone. i didn't want to. i was a good boy.  :-Pd-:  i love college! i can't wait for it to be warm out. i'm tired of being indoors. i'm tired of wearing clothes. i want to go skinning dipping in karen's pool again. i want to go to the beach with my boys and dive for frisbees and get sand in my mouth. i want to bask in the sun all day, wear sandals, eat cold crisp fresh sliced watermelon. i need a blow job. badly. i'm tired. i'm going to bed. kevin just made loud fart noises to people outside our window it was a riot i couldn't stop laughing. ok i'm done.  Have a smutty day.  - R w L super SMUT
