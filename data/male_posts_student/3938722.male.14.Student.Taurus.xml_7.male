REVIEWS!!   Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy : possibly the stupidest movie on the face of the earth...it gives kung pow a run for its money cuz its so stupid. however, i dont think ive ever fallen out of my chair laughing before, so its humor (VERY stupid humor) makes up for it. Will Ferrel is SO freaking hilarious (they make fun of retarded ppl! how screwy is that???)    The Villiage : All the "The scariest movie you will ever see" stuff is total CRAP. its not even as scary as signs...however, its better than that movie. (I didnt like signs so much). umm its a pretty decent movie, its got a good idea and everything, but the ending ruined the movie. its a twist, simliar to the rest of the movies that this dude directed, but not nearly as the one in the sixth sence (even thought the one in the others was WAY better)    Not Another Teen Movie : its another teen movie, what is there to say?    The Butterfly Effect : REALLY REALLY good. An amazing concept, with a great storyline. however, its really twisted, wrong and sick. One of the best movies i have ever seen, by far.    Hellboy : Didn't finish it, it looked pretty decent to tell the truth though...kinda random violence w/ a plot.     Jackass The Movie : STUPID, kinda funny, its an alright movie. RANDOM is the word.   Listening to: Horror Hotel - The Misfits   Reading: DUH! The Stupid History of the Human Race
