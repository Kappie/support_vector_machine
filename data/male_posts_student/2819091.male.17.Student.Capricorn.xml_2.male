       
      Forever floating in this sea of darkness, there is no one with me, no one to guide me...  Is there anyone out there?  Will you help me in this darkness?  I don't want to be alone anymore...  I want someone to share this journey with me within the sea of darkness...  Help me through...  Being alone in this darkness isn't what it used to be anymore.  No one to swim together in this peaceful but vast waters.  Please swim with me, I'd like to have someone with me to travel with...  I, who once loved being alone, now long for a friendship, a companionship with someone...  Please help me...  I no longer want to drift away in this sadness and loneliness...  I want to drift away with you...  My friend, my ally, my supporter.  Let's swim away from the sadness and find happiness for us, for we will travel anew...  Together...  THE END
