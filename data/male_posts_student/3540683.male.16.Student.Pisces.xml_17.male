You now have no right to  EVER  call me obsessed about a girl again.  In other news, we got our horses today, a black pony and a dappled Tennessee Walker...they are awesome, I can't wait to ride them around our property.  I'll have pics of them up soon, probably tomorrow sometime.  I don't really know what to talk about today, I had some shit in mind but then I got pissed off and forgot it....so yeah, we got horses, they are badass....um  Latest news: We got horses  Ronald Reagan died, I liked him much better after he got Alzheimers, im sure he did too, I wouldn't want to remember some of the things he did during his presidency.  Although that shows very little respect for the man, who was indeed much more powerful than me, I'm pissed off, so I don't care.  George W. Bush is a  FUCKING  moron.  I'm out of news.  until tomorrow night, Make love, not war....  -*Sprint*-
