Incredibly funny whilst drunk or otherwise blitzed.  Quite sad otherwise.   2)   urlLink Oolong  - the rabbit that balances rice cakes and film canisters on his head. 3)   urlLink Bill  Erik  - my favorite  urlLink Daily Texan  comic. 4)   urlLink Bitter Films  - home of the Academy Award-nominated  urlLink Rejected , quite possibly the best spent nine minutes of my life. My spoon is too big!   MORE  - watch the  urlLink first bit of Rejected  here.
