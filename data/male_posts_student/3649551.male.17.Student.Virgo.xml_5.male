And it is completely necessary, don't get me wrong. But I don't think that what we eat is so very vital that we should conform our life to it.  'Is not life more important than food ...?' Let's look at this new form of gluttony. CS Lewis writes about this in  Screwtape Letters , if I'm not much mistaken. He points out that a glutton is not merely someone who eats a lot or lives in excess: if you're going to great pains and causing trouble for other people simply to get a certain type of food, you're a glutton. That means if you're on some crazy diet that only allows you to eat ______, you're a glutton. You've lost the point of eating and you've placed entirely too much importance on it. Food is meant to sustain life, not dominate it. It is for this reason that I refuse to diet ... ever. I'd rather live a 'short' life and not have to worry about what I eat than to live a long miserable one that's centered on food.  I'll eat what I have to, maybe not because I particularly enjoy it, but because I'm simply sustaining myself. This is why I am going to be eating macaroni and cheese for lunch today. I don't especially like it, but it's food. The point isn't that I like food, but that I like life.
