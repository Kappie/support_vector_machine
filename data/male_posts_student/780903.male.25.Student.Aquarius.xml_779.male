Should all the casebooks be destroyed  in days of post-test time  In post-test time, my dear,  In post-test time,  We'll burn the outlines to a crisp  In post-test time  Should all the rules that we had learned Each unit we'll discard Forget the hours lecture spent In post-test time  And take your notes, my trusted friend  Delete the whole damn file We'll toss the syllabus away In post-test time
