I found out today that my Gr.8 trombone exam is... a month tomorrow, so I don't practice until tomorrow, so I've only got 1 month of practice left 'til the exam. What's the word that springs to mind? 'Damn'. There's not too much time 'til Les Mis, either, Apr.15-17, and I'm missing a few practices cause of various thingies. There's the 'damn' again. And then I've got Alice with the SDG, March 23rd; I've got Gigi, March 16-20th; GYWO concert March 27th; CAYO concert, March. 29th; CYB concert, March 15th... STRS Spring Concert, March 25th... how many 'damn's are there in one 'bugger'?  And my life is containing a lot of irony. This is irony that I am not enjoying at all. In fact it's irony that, with everything else the world's piling on me, I could totally do without, but ne'ertheless I'm in the situation where it's cropping up. AGAIN. The phrase "Why do I always do this?" springs to mind. As do hundreds upon hundreds of cursives.  I always manage to have a good side in my situations and I perpetuate this trend; I'm meeting up with Laura tomorrow, if she remembers... which rules more than a bit. I don't know whether it reverses the bad mood I'm currently in, though.  Quote of the day: "I did not live until today... How can I live when we are parted? Tomorrow, you'll be worlds away, And yet with you my world has started."  From   One Day More   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
