PLUS, i have to write a 5 page opinion paper (not double spaced) on "Grapes of Wrath" for American Lit, it's worth like 2 test grades..AHH! i have bible study tonite, but i dunno if i'm gonna go? anywayz, tomorrow is the last day of school before spring break, and im really happy, b/c i need to have a week vacation where i spend no time at home, and im at the beach everyday. who knows, maybe the friends and me will just camp at the beach for a day, but God knows i hate camping..we'll see.
