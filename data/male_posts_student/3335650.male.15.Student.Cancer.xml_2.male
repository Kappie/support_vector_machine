LoZ (Me) Age: 14, nearly 15 Sex: As often as possible (sorry, couldn't resist) Male Location: York, small town in north-england What i look like: *insert bloody picture here, i dunno how to yet* *gives up* long black hair, green eyes, whiteish brownish skin, quite tall... i'll chuck a pic on uploadit.org as soon as i can :-)  Jonny (He'll post here soonish, like maybe tomorrow) Age: 14, also nearly 15, but 1 month older than LoZ Sex: Male Location: Same as LoZ What he looks like: Blonde, short hair, blue eyes (i think) bit taller'n LoZ. White skin (get in the sun, you msn addict :-P ) Pic also soon on it's way!  Both: We go to school together and are forced to sit next to each other. Nah not really heh, but when I was first told I was sittin next to him, I was horrified... suicidal even! (just messin, jonny!)  Anyway, we drive our teachers crazy by singing our pencil case, dictionary and maybe rap in class. Or we just talk crap :D Oh, we're in year 9 btw...  If I've left anything out, leave me a comment :-)  Anyway, really gotta go sleep, I've got school tomorrow... again... IT SUCKS! Over 'n' out!
