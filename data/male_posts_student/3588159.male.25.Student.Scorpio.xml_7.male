You won’t be condemned for sharing your personal reflections.  But if anyone has actually heard from God, remember that His word has the harvest potency of ripe grain, able to multiply for a hundred-fold yield, unlike the flimsy straw of your rhetoric that is likely to be blown away in the first breeze of logic and a few days of sleep, or burned instantaneously by the heat of intelligent opposition.  Keep in mind that His word has the explosive ability of a roaring fire, able to purify and refine the toughest hearts and minds and consume any heresy or selfish lie.  Keep in mind that His word has the startling demolition capacity of a heavy sledge, able to split the earth or a soul and shatter rock or pride, so that water or brokenness can flow out, resulting in refreshment and healing.  Again, if it’s all you’ve got, people like a cute story now and then. But if you’ve heard from God, then you really have something. So you might want to go with that.   (Based on Jeremiah 23:28-29)
