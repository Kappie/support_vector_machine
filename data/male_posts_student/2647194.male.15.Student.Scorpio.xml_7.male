Blah,  I've got to bust through the biology test, and then the finish line of the Social test to reach that lap of luxury known as any day without school. Its 80 points too, oh joy. And I really sucked in the review today, which means I need to study-a lot, probably more than usual, which is close to none. So what exactly do I do in my non-studying time? I spend too much time online and I get caught by my mom...not fun. I have to figure out a way to evade her somehow, or else I'm never going to get my permit, let alone my license.  I'm most likely going skiing at Afton on Monday, so if I know you and you want to go, let me know. We need as many ppl as possible.  Back to that ol' bio test...its going to be 50 some points, and I'm not too great at Protein Synthesis and all that crap. That means more studying=yippee. Good thing for study halls and block days. Hehe, Mr. Shelton got mad at the wind ensemble today for not playing with enough "passion" and talking too much. Of course I had nothing to do with it...::shifty eyes:: It does pay to be back in that percussion section where you're out of the line of sight...hehe.  Random daily question: Who has ever heard of the band Tower of Power? If so, name 3 songs by them.  Daily Spanish funnies: Kevin Grey says, "Yo he sido un zanahoria." and Mrs. Sustic didn't catch it.  Mrs. Mooney's advisory won the challenge today, for once. Go us. I'm running out of ideas...um...my drumsticks are white/black striped...sort of. That means I'm tired, which merits the fact that I'm leaving soon, which eventually leads to the true equation sleep=good.  "I'm tired (too late to quit too soon to go home) I'm tired (too late to quit too soon to go home)"  Over and out, Bren
