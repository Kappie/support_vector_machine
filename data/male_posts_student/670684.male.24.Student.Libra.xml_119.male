Didn't work so well on the older guy.   fattassomalley: you've got to work the Leal in...Crystal Byrd didn't just let him fist...he had to sweet talk her with his second band trumpet triumphs DarylBurrows50: Actually he was a third trumpet. fattassomalley: in first band? DarylBurrows50: No.  Sixth band at band camp.  They played Space Shuttle Rock and We've Got the Spirit.  If you didn't go to band camp, shame.
