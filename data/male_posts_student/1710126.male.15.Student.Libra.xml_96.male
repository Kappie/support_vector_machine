Getting a family? Growing old? Becoming a grandfather?  What then? Read and do gardening all day? Reminiscing the past? Spending the rest of your days with your chosen spouse?   Waiting for death?  Why the endless competition? Why the endless need to study? To excel in life...why the need to excel in life? To have a comfortable one...why the need to have a comfortable life? To be happy...why be happy? To not be sad. In the end are you truly happy?  No matter how many times the sun rises to shine, it gets swallowed by the endless night. Life is not full of ups and downs, but a constant down with little hills of ups. A straight line with humps, not a sine graph.    It is so hard to be happy sometimes. But thats my role in life. Whats urs?
