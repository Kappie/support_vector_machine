(Apostrophe). We have successfully moved the Bower Place RadioShack to it's new location. That was a lot of god-damned work. Sunday: 8 hours. Monday: 12 hours. Tuesday: 15 hours. Wednesday: 8 hours. Thursday: 12 hours. Friday: 15 hours. Needless to say, I am quite beat. And as I'm sure many of us know, moving anything causes countless injuries. I never want to see another RadioShack again. Luckily, I am off today, and better yet, I'm out of there in two weeks.  Jeff Sloychuk was here. I feel touched. VOTE FOR HIM! Anyway. Off to lunch, now.
