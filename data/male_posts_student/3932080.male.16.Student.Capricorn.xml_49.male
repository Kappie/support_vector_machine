Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.    urlLink Hey Mama -The Black Eyed Peas Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #23 Brilliantly defining their versatility as a hip-hop group, the Black Eyed Peas went from asking “what’s wrong with the world, mama?” in their late 2003 hit “Where is the Love?” to demanding “hey mama, get on the floor and move your booty” in this reggae-rap jam. Putting together Fergie’s haunting vocals, a robotic chorus, carnival-funk organs, and the best spoon-using percussion since Pink’s “Just Like a Pill,” the Peas crafted their catchiest and best single from “Elephunk.”    The Verdict:  7.5/10 - The Fork  ( 3.75/5)     2004 Wild Card Singles Club Entry
