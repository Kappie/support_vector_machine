Having watched the latest movie last week, and realizing that I had only read the book once on the day of its release, guessed it wouldn't hurt to go through it again. Well other than the fact that I need to catch up on my school reading, do my weekly journal and get ready my army stuff, it shouldn't hurt. Yeah Right.  About halfway through the book already, I'm reminded of some reviews that I had read about the book. While I may agree that the book is a little long-winded, and the pace somewhat off at spots, I don't agree that it is the weakness in the series. While it may not be as good as  The Goblet of Fire , and the plot not as strong as  The Prisoner of Akzaban , it is not as weak as  The Chamber of Secrets , the weakness of the series in my opinion. Good thing that the movie done it good.  Speaking of which, its only natural that I found the movie for  Prisoner of Azkaban  to be the best of the lot, having a better overall plot, much stronger acting and a style of directing that fits the new direction that the plot heads towards. I can't wait to see the movie (or movies) that come out of  The Goblet of Fire , still my favorite book. Another good thing about the whole series is that hopefully people would follow the spelling of my real name as given in the books. It’s one “L” not two.  *grins*   Well hopefully i can finish off the book by tonight, get my fix and then get on with the business of school and service to the nation.
