The punishee or the punisher can decide to vary their interaction in mode and duration as well as reaction. Of course different people and situations will do things in different ways. But the reaction does not have to be proportional. The best acts of social punishment only require a few words to just have the oder person blow up and completely loose it. Of course that can harm. And that harm that you suply will hurt you too. Only if you are sure it was for the best possible course of action should social punishment be used.  It is a fine art that one of punishing there are no rules to its application just some guidelines which have to be understood by the practioners. most of the times punishment comes from the inside when of guard and the actual fact of punishment is only analised as such later. I think this is mainly because to plan knowingly that you are going to hurt someone may make you feel far worse than the situation you are in.  This are just some thoughts jotted as i am about to embark on another work of social punishment, yet my ass is the one on the line... and that is where art is at its best.
