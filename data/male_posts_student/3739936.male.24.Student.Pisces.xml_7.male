It's simply too good and too tasty to ignore. Not to mention it's the first decent step towards next-next-generation visuals. I'm sure Vin is very proud."   If you've never tried this game out, I suggest you do.  This is awsome.  Other games I am playing right now are Full Spectrum Warrior, Project Gotham 2, and believe it or not I'm still playing Ghost Recon once in a while (not the shitty PS2 version).
