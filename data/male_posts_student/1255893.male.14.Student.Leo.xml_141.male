Some would call you the most powerful and influential of all people. Those people are wrong.   The reality is that you DON'T really WANT to impose personal views or beliefs on others. Yet you are extroverted and intelligent, and you like to get involved. So you help others with the pursuit of knowledge.   You're the reason that people say "teachers are also students." You are as much a learner as a master, and this satisfies you.   You won't die a lonely death, but towards the end you'll grow introspective, wondering if your life meant anything. This will last for decades, and you'll die after your spouse.
