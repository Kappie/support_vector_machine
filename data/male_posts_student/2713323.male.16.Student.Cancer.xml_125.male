Kel and Den were the two among the huge mass of others. they were surrounded by guards carrying bows equipped with toothpicks as arrows. Mr teng was there and he was the head honcho. getting weirder...i was a NINJA (WOAH!). i had to save them. (WOAH!x2). i went in there and killed some people by sneaking up on them, just like how snake does it in metal gear solid. then i got found out i think, so the whole place went beserk, people were running, and me, kel and den were punking the bad guys out. toothpicks were flying all over and i dodged them like neo in matrix. suddenly, kel and den got trapped and i had to go over and take out 20+ dudes, kicking them in the face and such. then when i went up the stairs into the building to take out two snipers at the other building, i woke up. and the weird shit of the dream was that it all took part outside kels house. DOH! " i had another dream but i forgot it. heh. ook ook, bye.
