No, seriously. ;-) At the moment I am also listening to George Winston Jam out on the piano.  Linus and Lucy all the way. He is also crazy good....except on a piano. In case any of you kind hearted people out there want to randomly give me some money, I would rather have the Korg SP-500. Or even better the Triton Extreme. Also Korg. So, anytime now. I'm out, I need to read a certain other blog, then I need to do assorted variety packet special deals....of sorts. C'ya
