Looks nice on the outside and inside, and it really reminds me of  urlLink E-Town  (that's  urlLink Evanston Township High School  to everyone not from there). It's older, but updated. It's hard to describe, but it's fabulous. I'm going to love it. I'm not totally sure on my schedule, but I'll get it up when I know.
