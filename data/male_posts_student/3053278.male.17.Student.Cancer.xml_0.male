Patton   "Faith in the ability of a leader is of slight service unless it be united with faith in his justice." -George Goethals  "We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action." -Frank Tibolt  "No man is wise enough by himself." -Titus Maccius Plautus    That last quote reminds me that I have total respect for the other six captains and to achieve the goals we will need to be like one team. They will be my true companions in a time where my ideas of leadership are lost and hopefully they will allow me to do the same for them.
