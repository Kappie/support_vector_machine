SOOOO enjoy .  “ We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.” 							- Ralph Waldo Emerson   Through these words taken from the Self-Reliance, the definitive work of transcendent thought, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the forefather of the transcendentalist movement  sought to liberate his brethren from their self-imposed regression. Emerson  sought to erase this stain of  mediocrity, of… from the hearts of mankind, and open our souls to the ignored unlimited potential inherent in the heart of  every man, woman, and child born unto this earth. We, the children of Eden, the generation of tomorrow have made this world our sanctuary, a haven for cowardice. Humanity has grown to fear, to loathe its very nature, supplanting the intrinsic sprit of ingenuity, of individuality, of identity with suppression, stagnation, and the desire to  preserve the status quo. Stemming from the basest of  inclinations, we have created a totalitarian entity that deprives us of our divine nature. We have created Society. A dictator, guised as a benevolent force. Society does not protect, it oppresses, Society does not dream, no it’s thoughts lie stagnant, deteriorating in its presumptuous comfort. Perhaps the most frightening aspect of society is its absolute power over its populace, who are unaware that they live as slaves only by their own acquiescence. 		We are born into this world as was ordained by the creator. We  are born with the unique ability to appreciate, to adapt, to analyze, and most importantly to ponder. As a youth one strives to make sense of earth, searching reverently for truth and understanding.  This precious time is short lived. Society deems that there exists an age where individuality holds no currency in its domain. Systematically inculcating the youth of the world, with societal norms, instilling them with morals which have no significance or application, simply  because one cannot find significance in a given, one must be able to derive in order to comprehend. Society trains the progeny of  hope to be , harbingers of despair devoid of nature. By gearing our future to revere the lessons of the past above all else we destroy the truest part of our being, the ability to dream. For what are dreams but manifestations of our aspirations, our hopes, fears, the subconscious. 	Man has been neutered, we have been made to apologize for who we are, and strive to become what we must. This perverse institution has taught us to ignore the voice within for fear of being ostracized by our constituents. For fear, fear is the driving force behind this machine. Fear is the universal power source that galvanizes every component of society into fluidic motion. Spawned from  the fear of change, the fear of the unique spark of brilliance that radiates within the heart of humanity. The fear that not a select few, but everyone has the indiscriminate power to contribute, to make their impact on this planet. The fear that intelligence is not selective, that potential is abundant, this is what motivates our society to enslave us.  	The individual has been subjected to persecution, since man tasted the nature of evil. Initially those who chose not to conform would perish or suffer not as a direct result of the will of society, but as a result of not being part of a society that provides warmth, and shelter, the physical needs. In this, Society usurped the ultimate power from the individual, the power of self-determination, and ordained that to live one must conform. Those who did not, who realized their individual potential, and used this to manifest the divine, those who looked outside themselves not for comfort or protection, but for understanding and truth, where indeed struck down. Society crucified Jesus for daring to propose a spiritual life, for declaring himself a law unto his own, for advocating the existence of a being more substantial than itself. Society assassinated Dr Mr. Luther King for his civil disobedience, his defiance of its insatiable presence by leading a revolution of freedom. Society slaughtered Millions of Jews, for the simple fact that their existence did not concur with its ordained plan. Everyday society bludgeons the soul, the heart, and self-worth of a child by deeming it unfit, whether due to race, class, or nationality.  	It is inevitable that we will one day realize our divine  potential. It is inevitable that we will learn to look to ourselves as a standard, to look into our deepest conviction instead of ascribing to the values of another. Yet what frightening is the fact that we are comfortable living in this perpetual state of mediocrity, that we willingly ascribe to this mentally languishing doctrine. The longer we allow ourselves to see human law as an absolute, the longer we allow ourselves to be subject to this mental bondage. To subjugate a man one need not break his body it is ephemeral, the pain cannot sully the mind. To truly subjugate a man one must break the spirit, for in their lies the key to his power. We must not allow the spirit of humanity to be broken, but rather strive to awaken the spirit in our hearts.
