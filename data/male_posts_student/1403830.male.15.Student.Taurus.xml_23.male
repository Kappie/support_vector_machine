"Sam, what did you do on your vacation?"  "Well, I lost 25 pounds by basically not eating, went running most days  because I felt like I had to do something good for myself, worked at a  job that made me come home and bitch about it, only to go back the next  day.  And probably the biggest thing I did this summer was not getting  with kendall, and not telling her how I felt about her."  "What?   You didn't tell her?"  That's how I think the conversation would go.  Its one of those things where you value the actual act of liking her too  much to actually tell her how you feel.  Actually your just too damn scared that she'll think your a stalker and  never talk to you again.  That's a problem when you've built her up in your mind to be this dark  haired goddess with the cute eyes and the viscous smile.  Maybe I'm being immature about this.  Maybe I'll get one of my friends  to ask her out for me like we used to do in 5th grade. Ok, probably not,  but maybe I should just let this burn out until I don't like her  anymore, all feelings don't need to lead to a relationship.  People say I'm immature.  I'm fat.  Unfunny.  Slow.  Not awesome.  To  this, I say your right, I am all of those things.  In fact I'd be  hard-pressed to find 1 positive thing about myself for every 3 negative  things I said.  But I am happy with where I am right now.  I'm doing  things for me.  I wish I could be like you, easily amused.
