That's the second student we lose this year. Earlier this year is Allahyarham Zuhair, died of an accident. It also announced that tomorrow there would be a collection for the death of one our student's father. This year, we already have more than five such collection. Amidst the sadness we still strive forward to become the best among the best. Abdul Rahman Talib Secondary School - Ilmu, Ihsan, Bestari - Mantap Berkualiti.
