But hey I'm back for your not-so-weekly dose of my random ramblings. I have this MASSIVE fuck-off tooth ache, it really hurts like everytime I take a drink or bite down on it actually no, when I bite down it its okay its when I'm not biting down on it that it hurts. Which is stupid. It hurts alot and is preventing me from hoarding sloaths in  my printer so It needs to be gotten rid of but I cant because I have that thing - dentist-a-phobia, which basicly means I'm afraid of getting eaten by weather-balloons but I also got that thing where Im scared of going to the dentist cause they insist on shoving needles down my trachea. Anyhow, first the boring stuff, I had a couple of exams lately, monday I had Biology! Which I must say I didn't do that bad on apart from the question about the dog with the genetic hair and such, t'was quite the confundlement. Today I had IT today which resulted in much frustration I mean personally I think I ace'd the exam but It was a 2 hour exam and It took the whole class less than an hour yet they wouldn't let me leave the god damn hall. Felt like slapping them. Really hard! Also had maths today which I was very disappointed with cause I was convinced I was going to do well cause of all my tutor sessions and I just got really stressed during the exam. I think I might of atleast earned myself a 'C' grade. Thats good enough... I suppose. Fun things, last night, I went to Incubus with Hundred Reasons supporting which TOTALLY kicked ass and I mean totally, me and Charli got right to thr front (on the left) and Brandon Boyd was like right infront of us at one point and it was so cool. He was absoloutly amazing when singing and the instrumental side of things were kick-ass. Hundred Reasons were better in my opinion but I like them more than Incubus anyway. Best thing of the whole night was that Incubus did a cover of Black Hole Sun (Originally by Soundgarden) which was fucking awsome! I got band practice (kind of) on Friday which should be cool and then after that Im getting paid to sit there and watch TV whilst keeping a dog company so it doesn't bark when my aunts out. Ain't that cool?. I got Big Fish on DVD which kicks ass, cant wait to watch it, havn't had time at the moment *shakes head*. Anyhoos, my tooths hurting, and I think some people are pretty upset/angry with me, so I'm going to bed, so long my children of the night.
