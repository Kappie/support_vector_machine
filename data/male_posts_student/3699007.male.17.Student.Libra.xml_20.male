Then, I came home for a while and went to the hospital to see my grandmother.  She is still very weak, but she was more alert than she was yesterday.  She can still hug really hard and squeeze the hell out of my hand...LOL.  Nice to see she's progressing nicely.  Amie called me on the way to the hospital, didn't talk to her long because I was almost there, but I was shocked she called me because she is in FL with a certain guy, so it made me feel good to know she really does give a damn about me.  After me and my mom left, we went to Frontera and now I'm home.  I just got an email from some girl that was in my online class that wants to complain about the teacher.  I had no problem with her.  All her email responses were prompt and she helped as much as she could.  Don't really see what the big fuss is about, but my opinion is that if you have a problem with an online teacher, get over it because you got yourself into the situation to begin with.  Anyway, I'm gonna go play guitar, probably.  Tomorrow, Britt, Ashley, and myself, should finally do something.  :-) Later y'all.
