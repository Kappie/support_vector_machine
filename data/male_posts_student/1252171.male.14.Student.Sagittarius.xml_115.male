I don't have ADD or ADHD or anything like that.  I just act like a young child sometimes.  applejuice  sometimes I get a sugar-high, then I get realllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly hyper  young kids may be scared when I'm on a sugar-high.  My hobbies are roller-bladeing, drawing, listening to my parent yell at me, day-dreaming, day-dreaming while my parents yell at me, and thinking of people.  glshakhdosuhkruglie  I am also very random.  Me and mandy are friends to.  I am a guy but I don't like her in that way.  One more thing: sometime last week was the 1 year anniversary of this site.  (One More thing: Gage said that I could post on this site when he was away.)   YAY    -DarkBlaze-
