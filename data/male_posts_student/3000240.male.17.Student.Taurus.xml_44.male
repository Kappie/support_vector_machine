Well I fully understand that I failed to posted anything remotely worthwhile during Easter and this was for a number of reasons:  1. I was ill 2. I couldn't be bothered 3. Chewing the fat seemed a more than viable alternative 4. There was a wart on my shin which needed annihilating with a hefty pair of garden shears.    Anyhoo   I did get the sense of incredible loneliness and so I felt it was justly time for an ounce of soul searching and a slow but solid ponder about the view you get when you stand on the edge of cliffs or high storey flats and how it would truly feel to kick the bucket.  OOOOOOOOOh also I think I've really opened up about something, which sadly I won't go into, but has helped enormously, and I cried, REALLY cried away about everything, probably because it was a more genuine emotion than I usually have over things ( If you understand me on that one, your a better man than I, I apologise for its waffling ). However the whole thing has kind of helped me sort a few lingering problems and stamp some labels on unclear things (or maybe get me nearer finally doing them), and now I'm sure that I'll have a sudden new zest for things and I'll hopefully be able to take on things more full on, without the usual side-tracking I feel I have to do. So I promise a lot more wonderful pointless posting which I can well and truly excel at. Yay xBuBzx
