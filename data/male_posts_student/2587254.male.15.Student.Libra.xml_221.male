It was another one of those thinkin' days, and basically sitting in my house's A/C days once again. Plus I just bought Braveheart and Enemy At The Gates yesterday, so I thought I'd watch them. Yes I've seen both of the movies, but I felt like buying them and watching them again =).  For some reason I slept early last night, and woke up early as a result. My mind still thinks I have to wake up at 6am when I sleep at 12am *I normally had band in the school year* which is a good sign of the fact that I can easily adapt back into school life....which also sucks since my sleep was disturbed by a sudden awakening. So it took me awhile to get back to sleep, and eventually I'd wake up at 1030 only. No 1130 or 12 today. Read devos about how problems are there for a reason, and that there is always a positive way out of them. Hehe reminded me of the lesson Josh's dad taught us during Bible Study almost 3 months ago.  So afterwards, I decided to watch Braveheart. Mom was still sleeping, as she had to wake up early or something today, and I had to wait for lunch anyways, so continued the movie from yesterday night. Most of the cool battle scenes happened here, and lunch came just in time after I finished it.  After....er, during lunch I then thought to myself:   I'm supposed to call WLAC to set up a meeting time.   So, I then scrambled for the phone, and then quickly punched in the number. Apparently I was supposed to get back to him earlier *I think I emailed, but yeah....stupid emails thinking Gmail is junkmail* so then I had to call Josh, and frantically set up the committee with him. Eventually, we thought Steph would be one, and Jason or Gavin would be the other. The 3rd person would be me or Josh. So eventually we settled for Gavin, Steph, and me/Josh *we decide eventually* but for now one of us has to sit in for Steph anyways. All this work did come through, and eventually we set the time for Thursday at 4pm. Awesome. So there something done. Afterwards, I drummed around for a bit, then watched TV, ate, and then headed on compy for a bit.  For some reason I have to pick a meeting date for the 6crew to meet in Toronto, and I think 19th or 20th is going to be it.  Anyways I'm going to go for now.  Bye.
