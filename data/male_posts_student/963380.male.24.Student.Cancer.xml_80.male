I must admit I never really gave vadalism a second thought until I started finding random acts of it affecting my life (some wiseass thought it would bit witty to put a mouldy half loaf of bread in my mail box at one point - really brilliant stuff there). On this New Years Day I have to deal with the undesirable knowledge that a little boy in my family - however genetically removed - was abused and beaten to death by his foster family.  I've never known a single person who has been murdered before. I met this little chap precisely once. He was unable to speak at the time, he was so young. I'm never going to see him again.  I really don't have anything else to say about that right now.  I beat Halo and Monkey Island 4. Yay.  Rabbits Rabbits Rabbits.
