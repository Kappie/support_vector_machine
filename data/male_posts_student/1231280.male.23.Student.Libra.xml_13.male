Got home and bought kegs for the entire week and just got buttfaced and watched basketball. We all exploited the slut girl next door...what a dirty, dirty slut. Man, have I met a few of those in my day or what? Good news of the day is that I recieved a 95% on my 12 page paper on punk rock. That kicks ass. Bad news of the day is that I have to clean my room/apartment. Oh well. Off to ebd so I can get up and clean some more.  -Sieckman
