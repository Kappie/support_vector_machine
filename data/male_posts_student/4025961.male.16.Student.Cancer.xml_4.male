To my dismay, Iwas attacked by a gang of ants, and 3 crews of ...more ants. We suffered one casualty, which probably led to the start of this fight. My plastic red cup, which probably had some tang left in it. He was smothered, so I had to throw him away. Now I followed the escaping ants along the wall, to a crack in the corner. So as anyone else would, I picked up whatever spray was around, and bombed it. I didnt have any glade fresh spray, I was blessed with FEBREEZE spray. So yeah. What a wake up call.  Yep, wasted all my day. I sat around for a while, called a couple friends to see whassup. Turns out I missed out on errything. By nightfall, I realized I had forgotten to mow the lawn. Man, so I put it off for tomorrow.   My brother woke up at 9 today. 9 in the evening. And then he went back to bed. I dunno why.  I havent eaten yet. I'm still hungry.
