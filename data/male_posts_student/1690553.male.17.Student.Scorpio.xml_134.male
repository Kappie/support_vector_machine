The recomended reatil price of this printer is around RM600, so that makes it a mid-range printer.   Technology    Ink   This model employ a 4-colour Think Tank technology. Each colour is in it's own tank, Black, Cyan, Magenta and Yellow thus reducing the printing cost as you don't need to discard the whole colour catridge when one of the colour is depleted. Personally, I simply love the technology.    Resolution   True 4800 x 1200 dpi Resolution with 2pl  5pl Ink droplet which is more than enough to print out near-photo quality prints. It also support EXIF print to optimize printouts from digital cameras. But of course, it printouts still can't beat a 6-colour printer or the professional colour lab. Although good enough for casual photos it still lack the details.    Speed   Canon claims 22ppm Monochrome / 15ppm Colour but thay way too optimistic. As I tested, a full page of text took 10 seconds to print while a 4" x 6" borderless photo took a full 50 seconds to print.   Others   The printer is thankfully as claimed is quiet not like my earlier S600. Canon claims it's rated at 39db but I can't possibly verify it. The bundled softwares are mostly Canon own product but it's still easy to use and very functional like the Easy-Web Print app that make sure websites fit in the paper for printing and there's no pictures get cut into halves.
