I'm gonna make it as fast and painless as possible. Here's what's been happening:  I am one sexy bitch, as usual. I've been listening to a lot of Modest Mouse and it's been effecting how I play guitar. I like a girl by the name of Maria Krestyn and I have little to no idea of whether or not she can stand me. She smiles at me though and when she does I was to strangle myself because I never know what to do. But how is that different from it has always been? Born an socially-inept geek, always an socially-inept geek. Peter and Megan totally like each other and wouldn't it be great to see 'em together? (YES!)... That's what I thought. I'm becoming a hardcore catholic in the name of Maria and Peter and Megan and all the other fine souls at St. Thomas Aquinas College. No, I'm not going there for college. I eat more than usual. I just got a sidekick and have been IM'ing the crap out of all my friends with it. I got a blister on my second toe on my right foot.  That's about it. Peace out.         -- Feanor
