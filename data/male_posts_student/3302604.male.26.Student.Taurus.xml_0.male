The computers here are about ten times as good as the ones at university so it's a good play. Trouble is, it ghas just filled up with the local losers who've got nothing better to do than hang around in a library. I mean how desperate do you have to be at 11 on a Friday morning.  Anyway, had to laugh yesterday. Attendance at lectues and seminars has been slowly declining. Mainly because the actual courses are as dull as s**t. Out of the immediate group of us that normally hang abouit together, there ended up being only two all day yesterday. The best comment was at the end of one of the lectures, who doesn't realise just how little everyone wants to be there. ' It seem that people aren't reading their lecture notes or doing their seminar sheets '. You think? Maybe it's because we've also got Monday and Tuesday off next week (due to some weird local holiday). Can't complain, though.   Yesterday I said I was going to enjoy the sunshine after having worked through the glorious day that was Wednesday. Well, as soon as I finished lectures I thought I'd sit in the sunshine for lunch. Trouble is, as soon as I went to do it,the sun had gone and stayed gone for the rest of the day. Typical.  Feeling pretty good about myself as I've managed to avoid writing this essay for my education course (it's not as difficult as all that). I suppose I should use this week- end to actually get it done, but it's not going to be the greatest one ever but I just want to get it done right now. Last night, I was supposed to go out with a friend for a friend of hers birthday. Kinda wierd but I was up for it, after all, alcohol's always good. Unfortunately, she was supposed to text me about when we were going to meet up but it never happened. I suppose they decided they only wanted people who actually knew the guy who's birthday it was. I don't care, I stayed at home with a few of my mates and flatmate and ended up watching  urlLink Red Dwarf  dvds. A little alcohol  may  have been consumed.  Here's looking for a good week end  Jack
