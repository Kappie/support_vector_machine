I've seen him in several interviews lately in which he -- like myself and Mick Jagger -- can get no satisfaction. It's irritating to watch (if a bit ironic): interviewers who don't listen, and who are on to the next question before he finishes the last. Superficial searches for superficial meaning, satisfying their superficial needs. Robert Bly, in his book "Iron John," said: "The gift comes from the wound." So it is with Bill Clinton. Forever wounded. Forever suffering, in the gaze of an uncaring eye. Even those who care don't really care, unless they're mutants like myself. With apologies to William Buckley, the book of our times could be called: "Let Us Talk of Petty Things." And we do. Lord knows, we do.   So a man like Clinton, who has much too say, but finds himself squeezed between Jennifer Lopez's buttocks and Britney Spears' boobs -- (insert joke here) -- can't find an audience on our frantic TV dial. He's not alone, however...though more alone, since Marlon Brando died. Unlike James, Jimi, Jim, and Janis, and much like the tortured Brando: Clinton did everything right except his exit. And like the worst of us, has been fated to live. It's fitting, some would say, to have to stick around. This joke that has been played upon us -- this wretched, decrepit joke -- has more than one rimshot in mind for Bill Clinton. Though, contrary to what some might think, it's not a matter of getting what he deserves. Who does, after all? Even if they deserve the worst, which Bill Clinton most assuredly does not.    I'm not above it myself. I've been known to crack wise with a Clinton joke, just because -- and perhaps this is fitting -- just because I can. None so profound as my favorite, which is: "What would John Kennedy say about the Monica Lewinsky scandal? He would say (to paraphrase his famous speech, in his New England accent): 'He did it, not because she was easy...but because he was haaad!'" I've carted that joke around for years now, like a kid forever on his way to soccer practice. It no longer even makes me laugh. And yet I keep it, in the vain hope that one day someone will appreciate just how truly clever I am.  They never do, though, Bill, they never do. The rotten bastards never will. I coulda been a contender, had life not gotten in the way. I could have been a champion, had it not involved rising to the occasion. Clinton met every challenge, of course, but then he took it too far. Any sane man would. Laughter in excess turns to sorrow, and excess tears to laughter. So said William Blake, roughly...and so it is for Bill. But his suffering makes us better, by letting us know what lies ahead. If we're not cautious. If we're too good. If we strive too far. Achievement in excess is decadence. And excessive decadence? Well, that just leads to blogging in the middle of the night.  From the act of a quintessential loser, John Kennedy's libido spilt out over the land. His head cracked open and infected the place, and gave us the roaring Sixties. A child of that libido, Bill Clinton, found Kennedy's intelligence and carried it back to the White House. But like his idol, he too, would end in tragedy, with a shot heard 'round the world. A rim shot, or whatever...whatever suits your need. Bill Clinton was America's Rorschach test. And unlike the Rhodes Scholar who did so much for our country, America flunked.
