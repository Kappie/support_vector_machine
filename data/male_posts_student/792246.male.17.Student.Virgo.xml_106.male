Caitlyn is cute and adorable. Add sweet to that.  Jeeyon is too. But we already knew that.  Brittny is my new addiction. She's cool and my boyfriend. Soon I'll probably get sick of her and having fun with her will become tedious, but until then she is "teh bomb"!  I saw people today I never wanted to see again. I wanted to die.  Lizzy. Lizzy Lizzy Lizzy. What can I say about her? I'm engaged to her for one. And I love her. Like a brother. >_  Portia's blog makes her sound so sad. I wish I could send some electronic love to her.  I don't know why I'm typing this, but I'm enjoying it.  And Ed. Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky the 4th. If Lizzy permits, I would like to ask for your hand in marriage. Hearing you sing "Sasarai no Cowboy" made me realize that you are me if I were an eccentric female red-head from the future with an affinity for hacking.
