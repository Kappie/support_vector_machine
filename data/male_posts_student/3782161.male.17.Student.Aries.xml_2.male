Informed people make informed decisions, and like it or not, you two nameless no-hopers, people are informing themselves. Learning about iraq. Learning about the bush family. About cheney and halliburton. About our foreign policy in general, and you will be surprised, my friends, come november, that there are many MANY people who have made a decision to vote in this crucial year. People who are ashamed to have seen america's name dragged into the mud by these war criminals. These evil war profiteers, who want americans once more to stand proud on the international stage, who want to DEFEND america from these hate stirrers. These terrorist justifiers, these evil dweebs. ROLL ON NOVEMBER! WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK!   Lets not elect Bush again...   P.S. - I heard a bloody awesome joke, okay here it goes...                "My girlfriend said I'm a pedifile"        And I said "That's an awfully big word for an eight year old!"         Ain't that just the most misrable thing you've ever heard! I love it!
