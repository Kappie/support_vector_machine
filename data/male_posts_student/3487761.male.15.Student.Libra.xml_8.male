Being not sure that I will get a great result make me sleepless for a few days........even though i think I may do quite well......I'll just keep my finger cross until I take the oral, listening, and finally the result in August.    For the solarcar competition, I was relieved that my team's solar car was able to move. In fact we got a C.O.P.    My live changes now. I could not concentrate on my studis because of the post eaxams blue.......saddd......I hope I'll get better when I wake up the next day.
