I couldn't log in properly, so I emailed the admin to find out whta's wrong. I don't know whether they did help me fix the problem, but anyway it's fixed now so I'm fine with it. Anyway I realised I'm not posting much about my regular life anymore, so since I'm free and not sleepy, I'll do that right now!  First let's start off with the tests. Quite a few tests back over the recent weeks, and I topped all of them! With a Bio and E Maths perfect, I'm invincible at the moment. At least since this week, that is... I had a E Maths test on Monday on a topic I haven't done with my tutor, and I know that I did really horribly. Then yesterday came the big blow, my English test came back and I crapped. I actually failed an English test. At one point in time I remembered being regarded as an English expert. And I failed my test, 21/50. Entirely depressing! I guess it put me in place, so now I've got to work even harder... I'm really starting to wonder how long more I can keep this up. I have a feeling I'm going to break soon.  Anyway for Biology that idiotic b!tch Kelvin Chen got 24/25. He's really scary, cause now he's pumped to try and knock me off my top spot. I hoped he got really discouraged by my beating him when I didn't even study the night before. I'm wondering how I can convey that to him. "You're stupid... I didn't even need to study to get this one, and you worked so hard for a less than perfect score." Any suggestions on how that message can get to him?  I went out with Mum and Dad today, and if I remember correctly I ate Shanghainese. My memory is horrible these days, need to think before I can remember what I ate a few hours ago. On the way there there was this old Caucasian man pushing his wife out of Gleneagles hospital. His wife seemed to be real sick and only had her ward robes on, and her flesh was poring out of it. I didn't mean to say she's fat, I just wanted to show how weak and helpless she looked. Anyway they seemed to be rushing to Tanglin Mall. I really don't know what was happening, but I kind of think she was pretty much ready to go, and her husband was granting her her last wish or something. It's scary to think that you might be in this position a couple of years down the road. That's probably one of the reasons why I don't want to get married. C.S Lewis once said, "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken." I never want to fall in love.
