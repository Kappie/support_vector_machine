There is no definitive set-in-stone path in my mind - there are 2 that I could take - to do, or not to do. To ask, or not to ask. I guess to be a man, or to be Jon. I don't know what man would do. I have less idea what Jon would do. Perhaps the question in my mind is one that begs an answer, and it appears to be only quenchable by asking the question in the correct setting. What's done is done, I have to leave the past behind me and perhaps look to the immediate future. The warning sounds blare in my mind but I feel it has to be done - whether I succeed in my quest for the time to be soon or whether the timing is bad, and set in even less apple-blossomed times, perhaps is an unanswerable question at the moment. Will I 'chicken out' at this late stage? Can I give up? Or, more importantly, can I proceed and do what must be done, if the answering action is repudiation? Can my confidence suffer another blow, forcing the phrase "the higher you climb, the harder you fall" into sharp focus?  What is love?  Quote of the day: "What's done is done, And what's won is one, And what's lost is lost, And gone forever. I can only pray for a bright, brand new day, In the town I loved so well."  From the Irish folk song   The Town I Loved so Well   Love, Jon Roskilly
