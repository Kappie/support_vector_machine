I've packed all my stuff, at least that's what I thought, it turns out that my mum's complaining about me putting an amount too small to suit the needs of the trip...well I guess that's life. Um... I thought I'd just bring up a current running issue. You see the fact is that I can't run this web-blog on my own because there's going to be a lot of stuff happening next year. So I atleast need one volunteer (who knows how to use blogs) who can help me run this "Grade 10 -- The Garbage" blog. If you are interested in helping e-mail me at  urlLink smiklakhani@zhotmail.com  (without the "z", which is a prevention method used for anti-spamming). If I don't find anyone, I guess I can manage the blog on my own...  Anyway, here's a picture I've been working on lately (using Jasc Paint Shop Pro 7.04) (69.1KB)...        "Matthew Franzen At The Elementary School"
