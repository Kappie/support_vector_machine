I was thinking about how to escape from having a really low self esteem.  Now, while there may be multiple reasons why someone doesn't feel good about themselves, I think that one of the falsehoods that is commonly preached is that to escape a low self esteem, you just need to be prouder of yourself, and not give a damn what others think.  I would like to prescribe a completely opposite remedy.  I think that a god way to get out of the cycle of low selfe esteem is to get off of your high horse and start loving the people around you for once instead of yourself.  Gasp, shock, woah.  Yep, thats right.  I read once that the ultimate in self worship is despair.  Think about it.  Someone who has a low self esteem, often is FULL OF PRIDE! Thats why they have such a hard time in life.  They are constantly worried about what others are thinking.  They are so focussed on their own needs that they have forgotten that there are many more important things in life than their own needs.  Got a low self esteem?  want to feel better about yourself?  Then take my advice...forget about yourself for one second, and love someone in your life.  Serve someone.  Give to someone.  You will be amazed at how a servants heart can make you feel like pure gold. And it's funny, when you serve people, they tend to like you and want to serve you back.  That leads to relationships, intimacy, and ultimately a better view of yourself.  Ok, enough babbling for one day.  Cheers.
