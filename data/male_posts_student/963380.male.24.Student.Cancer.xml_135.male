Indiana Jones is being released on DVD tomorrow.  Hey.  HEY. Jesus. I don't mind the laughing, but try to keep it *civil*  It's a pretty significant event for a boy who has always looked up to Harrison Ford. I've got the jacket, I've got the hat and I've got the whip. Now all I need are some Nazis - whose asses shall promptly be kicked.  In other great news, I'm whupping Glennis in the month to date thing. That means I get to go to the vendor fair and he doesn't. If I can keep this up for the next 10 days I can laugh manically and rub it RIGHT in. I'm an asshole, but I'm good at it.  My days are filled entirely with computer repair. It's all I do.  Someone shoot me.
