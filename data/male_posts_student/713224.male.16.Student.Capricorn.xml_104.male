They are two very devoute gamers, and they are both pretty funny. It should be interesting to see this new version come together. They are not ready to start posting yet because they are still in school with finals coming up, but after my camp (which I go to with one of the kids) I will set them up and show them around blogger, etc. You can probly expect the site to start picking up again in late June/early July. I also have a few projects of my own which im looking forward to because they are now heavily funded (I found a JOB). More about the job and the first of my projects later.
