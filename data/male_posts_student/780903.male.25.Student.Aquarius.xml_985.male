"Yo Momma's so poor she can't afford to file for bankruptcy." "Yo Momma's so fat she wants to sue McDonalds but can't get up off the couch to file the lawsuit." "Yo Momma's so stupid she doesn't know the difference between rational basis review and strict scrutiny." "Yo Momma's so mentally ill she might actually have a reason to plead insanity instead of just faking it to get out of jail." "Yo Momma's so deformed that if she had a skin graft operation that made hair grow out of her hands, it would be an improvement." "Yo Momma's so tired she couldn't even do twelve pages of Con Law reading before falling asleep last night." "Yo Momma's so sad she makes first-year associates look like they just won the lottery." "Yo Momma's so fat or stupid or both she had to take the LSAT twice just to get scores that added up to her weight."
