Even if the whip does no strike the helpless prisoner's body, it surely cuts deeply at his soul.  We all are prisoners at one time or another in our lives, prisoners to ourselves or to the expectations of those around us. It is a burden that all people endure, that all people despise, and that few people ever learn to escape. I perhaps are one of them who cannot escape the bound of reality. Sometimes living for others seems like the only choice, we in life are chained by society and law. Do we have to follow?
