I still don't understand the part on how Piper can expel out Isis's soul (oh wait...now I do...I read the script).   Yesterday was the Combined Science Practical. Meow meow! Overall, it was quite easy. Yeah ha. I was so worrying I don't have enough time. But in the end, I do la. I remembered to bring my I/C and Entry Proof, so lucky no troubles. I was posted to Bio Lab 1, same seating arrangement ask before. The Physics paper was quite easy, testing for density of the liquid. Meow meow! I completed that within 30 minutes. I moved on to Chemistry. Woah! Kinda easy man! I tested everything correctly. Ammonium Sulphate's the compound I tested for. Wee-hee! I felt good in the end. Woo-hoo!  After Prac, we were quarantined in class till 1.30. Mrs Chua gave us some biscuit, but it got lost along the way (I suspect the boys' greediness have something to do with this). So, we stayed hungry till 1.30, where all of us rushed down to eat something! Woah! Today Hann very funny leh. He pretened to be a spy catching thieves (oh! the school was robbed today...canteen and bookshop...poor things!). so basically, he tried to hide behind the door and scare anyone who walks in. HaHaHa!! Everybody saw him through the window and just like look at him. So funny man!! HAHAHA! I laughed really hard when he was 'caught'. Everybody did too! He fianlly 'caught' someone...AiLian. HaHa! He shouted at AiLian! So meow meow funny. The E-Maths mock was very okay. Felt so happy doing the paper.   Moving onto today. Woah! Today was fun-filled with activities! First, the school gave us a talk on graduation day. Gonna look forward to it tomorrow! Then. Miss Govind gave us a talk on the carnival next year. I am so gonna return to have fun and play along! Then, we went for PE and all. Good game of b-ball, I must say. Last PE lesson le. Then, we went up for Chem. Mrs Tan came to visit us. She talked about going to JC and our L1R5. Me-ow meow!   After recess, we have English. The Band 1 did their English mock exam first. Thong is on course, and she's having lessons during the afternoon. Me and Siva just discussed along our writing. I wrote on "What artistic talent would you like to possess and why?". I wrote about the talent to play piano pieces wonderfully. HeHe! In the library, Yit Hann snatched my Paper 1 away from me. Talk about integrity! Who used to chide me for having no integrity? And what lame excuses! Temptation my foot! If you have integrity, you won't give in to your temptations. This is an obvious case of qi ren tai sheng. Sigh.....now he has an unfair advantage. I don't really care about the advantage part la (Anyone can easily win him! HA!). It's just the inegrity bit. What right does he have to say that I have no integrity, when he himself has none in the first place? Sigh....  Today, I was given the opportunity to write in Sonia'a autograph book. Wee! I wrote my message to her. I decorated quite a fair bit too (don't laugh ar! I can decorate, hor?). WQ is so negative. He keeps critisizing my entry (when all I did was point out his mistake. Writing "Anyway" as "Anywhere"!), saying things like "Oh! You smudged the ink. Serves your right!" Hey! This reminds me of Honeyz's End Of The Line.   Seems like I can't do you right. All I do or say is wrong. All the smallest thing critisised. I deserve some damn respect. Nothing more and nothing less.   He's like the Tian DaHua. Keep yakking and yakking, complaining and complaining and blaming and blaming, and none of his words are nice to listen to. Sheez. Some people. Oh! Speaking of Tian DaHua! He got divorced by LingLing! YaY!! Good for LingLing! I whole-heartedly support her decision! This is a warning to all those "Tian DaHua"s out there. Better keep your mouth shut when you want to say something negative. Better be more open-hearted and accept criticism. Better STOP critisizing now, or else it's too late to eat your words.  Well, we went through guided writing types during EL lesson today. After that, we did the Part 2 (after grumbles..sheez!). We ended at 4 something. I stayed back with XC to wait for him to go music room to meet Low for awhile.   Today leh, Wendy kinda experienced a breakdown. It's too tiring to organize a big event like chalet, I guess.Well, I made her happy over nothing, over a misunderstanding of my father's NTUC Link Card. Sigh....She gave up planning for chalet! That's...not good! She's been having this dream since this year....she can't give up like this! Yes, Wendy! I know it's tiring. It's damn tiring. But do you really want to give it up just like that? Only after experiencing a minor setback? We can always pay the non-discounted rates. Your dream, Wendy! Your friends' dreams too. I want to go to chalet to enjoy myself with my friends around me. Like you, Amanda, Hann...Pick yourself up. Try again. And again. Never say die, alright?  Alright. I think I end here liao la. Very very tired le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
