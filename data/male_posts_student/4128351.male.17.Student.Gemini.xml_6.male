I talked to my girlfriend on the phone tonight, I miss her more than anything I think I've ever missed before.      I took a few more things down from my new room, downloaded a few more indie CD's from my friends on AIM, and did nothing some more.      Me and Brice watched  Ocean's Eleven...  it kicked ass.  I'd always wanted to watch it, and I'm glad I did.  I ate pepperoni and Kraft Four-Blend cheese and I'll probably get sick now.  It was good though.        Then, Brice played Playstation while I played guitar for about an hour.  Now, I'm just downloading more indie CD's and getting sleepy.      I'm going to go to bed now, I think.  I love you.      Goodnight.
