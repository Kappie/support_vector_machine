It's too much, feels like I should chop it off. Pain... Christmas is coming up, and I need to buy some people some stuff... Actually I'm not going to do any christmas stuff. Actually the only person that is getting a gift is Dollface, and that's cause it's her b-day in a couple of days. That doesn't mean that I  don't love you guys, its just that I am poor like a well...the title explains it, my moneys hehehe moneys...hehehe lies spilled across the street.
