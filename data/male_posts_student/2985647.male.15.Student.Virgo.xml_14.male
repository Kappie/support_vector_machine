Its Wednesday, and I got absolutely fook all to do :(  So, here is a random joke:  2 young friends were playing football in the park, just outside Manchester, when out of nowhere, a savage beast of a dog attacked one of them that started to go for the throat and all that. His friend, however, managed to bring up all his courage and wrestled the dog off his friend, kills the dog and saved the day, and all that.   A reporter was walking past at the time, and was so impressed by this act of courage, that he offered to run the heroic story on page 1. So he went up to the boy and said, "I can see the headlines now. UNITED FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS BEAST." The boy replied, "But I don't support Man U." "Ok," said the reporter, "CITY HERO RESCUES MATE FROM SAVAGE ANIMAL." "I don't support City either," was the reply from the boy. "Who do you support then?" said the reporter. "I support Liverpool," came the reply. So, the next day, the headline said:   SCOUSE BARSTARD MURDERS FAMILY PET
