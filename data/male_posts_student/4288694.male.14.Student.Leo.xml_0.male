Let's just say that my thinking cap got stolen by who knows who (boos..)   Well, job done. By the way, does anyone know where I can find a tagboard?  Actually, there was a dog in church today, quite cute and docile too. It allowed almost everyone to stroke it, and I think it didn't bark. Think. Haha, I wanted to run over to shineforth initially, but for some reason(can't tell :X, confidential;))I decided to stay.I met up with a few friends, then church started. And ended.Then sunday school started, and ended. Nothing much happened though(we discussed cults). At least I learned something. I SHOULD HAVE GONE TO.....   Nevermind.   Muhahaha...time to initiate the opening of a hate list (lol saw my friend's blog...ok ok copyrat or loser or lameo..what...evvver *rolls eyes*):   1)-NONE   2)-NONE   3)-NONE   The comrades on this list may be subjuct to execution by the following manners:   (a) disembowlment (I mean your schoolbag...so that whatever stuff that's personel..*points to zz* may be disclosed to the public and eventually the entire school cohort.....)  (b) reduction (ummm...with reference to your marks...*whistles* someone might accidentally spill some coffee onto your precious little script....oh and not the addition of hydrogen ions to your finger by electrolysis, although that give me an idea....)  (c) boxing ("And today's showdown, the mighty hulk versus the prefect's handy dandy....notebook and trusty sidekick, the pen." Prefect ticks box with '1 demerit point'....anddddd the prefects win it!!! "See I trained them so well!!!" I think you all know who I am talking about)  (d) dis-integration (no...not the maths...but the ms-ages. Yes, your phone would be checked for messages from your *a-hem* and told to every living soul in school)   Regards: with regards to some very special people in my class who will be the hitmen...:p   Anyway nobody's going to die...yet. Muhahahaha..lol(irritating people who are egoistic and are mentally challenged may be the most suitable targets...)  Ciao, ceil out...I'll be back!
