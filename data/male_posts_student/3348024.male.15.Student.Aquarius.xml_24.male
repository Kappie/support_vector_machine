It's bad enough to have a jackass for a teacher, but to have a jackass that hates me is even worse.  Here's a little story about that cocksucking piece of shit.  He gave us our midterm evaluation sheets today(tomorrow's the last day of class).  We were supposed to get these sheets last week so that we could see what we needed to work on.  Well, I got mine, and apparently I'm an out of control driver and I drive blindfolded with my feet on the wheel using my face to press the gas and brake pedals because out of 35 categories, 5 were good(the highest score).  The rest were poor(the lowest score).  I know I might not be a perfect driver, but I'm sure there are areas where I don't suck, but honestly, I don't deserve a poor in every fucking category... BTW, the 5 I got a good on were getting in the car and preparing to drive.  Well, at least I'm not a danger to society in that area.
