I now have no plans for the day but doing my homework and watching seven episodes of Friends. Brilliant.  Ohoho, the weather's lovely, so I might as well get a book and read outside for a while. Now... which of the thirty-odd books on my to-read pile shall I pick?  The Dow's back above 10,000 points, aw, and Nikkei's still just below its 11,000 benchmark. Still, musn't grumble, eh?  I'm shit, ahh, Scott.
