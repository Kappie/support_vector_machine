The first SmackDown! after the brand extension this year, showcased a rich, arrogant, redneck, rascist character going by the name of John Bradshaw Layfield. Later that night, the main event was Booker T/Eddie Guerrero for the WWE Championship I believe. At the conclusion of this match, the same guy that was introduced to the world earlier that night attacked Eddie Guerrero and planted the seeds for a Guerrero/Layfield feud. Just a few minutes after that SmackDown! went off the air, many, many smarks were dreading the possibility of a Layfield push towards the main event scene. But what they dreaded eventually became a reality. A man that debuted under the name Justin Hawk Bradshaw eight years ealier, was apart of the team "The New Blackjacks" just a year later. Then joined up with Faarooq to create the Acolytes and eventually join the Ministry. Then turn face as the APA. Then break off into singles action in 2002. Take time off until the summer of 2003. And then break up with Faarooq and apart from the APA. And now all of a sudden he becomes a rich, arrogant, rascist and now challenges for the WWE Championship. What a twist of events is that.  Now he is the most hated man in WWE by marks and especially by the smarks. But I think people get on JBL too much. His mic skills are very good. And his promos have infact been better than Eddie's this year since he's become champion. His matches with Guerrero haven't been dissapointing and the mere fact of how much heat he gets should be a good backup point for his reign. I believe this reign won't be as bad as people imagine and that it's better for Eddie to chase the championship rather than being chased due to the lack of main eventers. This will probably shock fans as a decent one, and he really shouldn't get all the bashing he gets from the internet.
