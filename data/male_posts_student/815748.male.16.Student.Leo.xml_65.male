But the most recent post, lemme tellya, Taiwan is the real China, not a colony of Commie China, not Japan, and the Commies are too trying to bomb and invade and Shi'ite.  This vacation, all I've been doing is Mock Trials and going to movies and mainly sitting in front of my computer.  I ought to do something.  And my Burke direct needs serious work.  And I procrastinate so much.  And I should probably start my Heidi project.  And stop beginning sentences with conjunctions.  What else...  I don't know how much I should give away in my blog.  The last time I did, it was pretty obvious, even though Sully misinterpreted it.  Hmm.  It's not like they read it anyway, they aren't exactly big computer types as far as I can gather.  As I've said in a convo or too, it's fun talking about this stuff, because it's like The OC with all of these eternal issues and cliffhangers and such, the only difference is I never get any, if you know what I mean.  During vacation, though, there are few developments.  So anyway, stay tuned for a Burke revision if you're in Mock Trials (and know what you're talking about), and tell me if I should talk about the "stuff" on the ol' blogerino.
