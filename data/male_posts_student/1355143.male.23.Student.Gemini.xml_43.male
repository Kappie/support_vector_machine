Been busy with school and other activities here, trying to stay caught up, but I've done my fair share of going out. However, it's not quite as carefree as Barcelona, where I really had no responsibilities and no one to answer to. Murphy's Pub isn't quite the same as a real Irish pub, but it's still good to be at the pubs at home. Went to this bar last night that usually only 1st years frequent. We used to be big fans, but the massive urine lake on the floor eventually drove us away. But last night we ventured back, and I must say that Adam, Ulli, and Walker would've thoroughly enjoyed it. The number of fit girls in the crowd was unreal....quite enough to go around with you boys. The evening ended with a gaggle of girls dancing on the bar and two girls making out with each other hardcore on the bar. I got in trouble with the gf for looking, but such is life. Just got a job actually...like Ulli, I will be a bank employee, but as a teller. Can't help but feel somewhat like Banks in Mary Poppins.   Walker, I totally know what you mean about the strangeness of running into people. Since I've been back I've run into so many people I was in Ireland or Spain with. Chilled at the bar with Nim a bit the other night--cracked a few Jewish jokes. I now give Nate rides to school in the morning since he lives across the courtyard. Just kinda take it all with a grain of salt. Adam, I hope you survive the ravages of the Barcelona night life. I'm just trying to survive the wicked snow and ice that won't stop coming. Take care, all.  Tim
