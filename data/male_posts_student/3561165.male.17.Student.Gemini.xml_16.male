We had a succession of interesting andworthwhile conversations, as we always do. I feel warm and fuzzy inside, because I did something selfless for once andslept on the floor.David phoned and told me he has aquired Avril Lavigne's new album, which is nice. It'll be good to see all my friends when I get back home from America,for all their merits and demerits.Due to my decadence and irresponsibility I've had to go to extreme measures to acquire enough money to purchase a coach ticket to get to Birmingham tonight. Oh yes, that's right I'm zooming to America to visit my Father tonightand for much of tomorrow. I intend upon getting utterly plastered on the flight, it'll disenvenom (is that even a word? If it is, I like it!) the experience and tedium of sitting for eleven hours, stationary. I'm so very tired, I feel like I could sleep for a month, I feel completely vacuous and thinly-spread. I'll update my journal soon I guess, when I'm in America.   Mood: Maybe one day my cavalier approach to life will pay off. Music: Radiohead - Exit Music (for a film); Radiohead - Talk show host; Radiohead - Stop Whispering; Led Zeppelin - Heartbreaker. Quote of the day: "At the age of fifty, you have the face that you truly deserve" ~ George Orwell, shortly before he died aged forty-seven.
