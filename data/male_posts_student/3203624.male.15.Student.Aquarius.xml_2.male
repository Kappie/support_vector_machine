Their  5 STRAIGHT LOSSES  show that they are nothing without their best players (Sosa, Prior, Wood, etc.). They fail to come together as a team when they lose or when a player gets injured. They just think, "Oh, poor us, we'll never win without Sosa/Wood/Prior." Give me a fuggin' break.  Sox rule. At least they're in god damn 1st. And I got free tix to go to the Sox game on June 22. Maybe I'll just forget about the Cubs and move on to an actual team. The Cubs better get their sh*t straight quickly. VERY quickly.  Oh, incase you didn't know: The Cubs lost both games of the double header yesterday against the Pirates and lost AGAIN against them tonight. The last game in the series is tomorrow (Sunday).
