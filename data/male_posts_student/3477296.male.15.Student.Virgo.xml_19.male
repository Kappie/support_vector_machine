HAPPY BDAY JAMES! yes...a bit random. almerick...stop being a retard --- damn spamming our tagboard using alias...this applies to wannabe spammers and also james in and benlee yap *glares* and mabel...i shall 'DUH' you for the rest of eternity ^__^ keke. i modified my layout for those critical morons...ie JACK. i changed the navigation panel and also added a 'home' link as suggested by jono and jack.
