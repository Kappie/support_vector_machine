I persevere.  A crowded room, these whitewashed tombs,  they raise their glasses high, they kiss the past goodbye.   This New Years Eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow.  My heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe,  this New Years Eve, will turn out better than before,  I'm holding on, still holding out, until they close the door... on me.   It's New Years Eve and I feel my insecurities,  are haunting me like ghosts, this sinking quicksand.  And then with thunderous praise and lofty adoration,  a second passes by, yet nothing changes.  I hate my skin, this grave I'm standing in.  Another change of years, and I wish I wasn't here.   A year goes by and I'm staring at my watch again,  and I dig deep this time, for something greater than I've ever been,  life to ancient wineskins. And I was blind but now I see.   This New Years Eve, something must change me inside,  I'm crooked and misguided, and tired of being tired.  This New Years Eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow.  My heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe, in You.  -new year's eve. five iron frenzy-
