As you may have heard, just about any time that Cam and I go to PCC, we end up seeing some really funny shit; one time, TWO occurences of the strange and completely unneeded.        So here goes...        #1: Carls JR. Manager: "Mam, you can't put soda in that cup, if you want to buy soda you can use this cup, but for that cup...ONLY WATER!!!"     Old Lady: "OK..." (Get's sprite, without even caring to look and see if the bastards are watching, that's some funny shit.)        #2/3: These incedents occured(however the fuck you spell that) at an infamous institution among the East Pass crowd.     In Lucky Boy, Cam and I were nonschalantly eating our lunch when two grown White, extremely white, people walked in. He slapped her ass as he was waiting for the guy at the register, then started caressing her back...NASTY!!! Also witness to these events was a "mexican" guy who started to laugh so hard he had to leave.     Then there was the "GUY" who walked in. He was wearing a red Hello Kitty type shirt, a pair of red Dockers shorts, pleated of course, and a red with white polka dot bandana for a belt. Now, this doesn't seem so strange, "maybe he's gay" you think. NO! He's just wierd. His belly was out furter than a pregnant fat lady, but the rest was normal proportions, what the fuck? And yes, I do have pictures of the "GUY."        #4: Sir Cam and I were going to PCC to get our bullshit group counseling, and yes, it was a lot of bullshit. Afterwards, a drink from Carls JR. seemed to be in order. Let me just say, never blast good music in a drive thru where people who listen to "white people music" work. The attendant did a "WTF!?" kind of face, then started to head bob. I decided my penny change wasn't worth any more head bobbing so I sped off with Cam in tow.      #5: Cam told me he wished he was on some sort of team. We saw these two girl soccer players. They were walking to their car.   Soccer Player: "OH MY GOD!!! What the hell is this?...OH MY GOD, It's a parking ticket!? Wait, the car behind me didn't get a ticket!?"   Cam: "Yeah, that's cus the car behind you isn't parked in the red..."    For now, that's it.
