And you know the saying "Seven days without penguin makes one week/weak"   Hehe, thats a great saying.      I don't remember if i blogged about it, but i was having trouble with Gaim, the IM program that i was using in linux.  My trouble was that gaim would crash as soon as i logged in.  I couldn't do anything with it.  It was getting to the point where i was annoyed.  Well, all that is fixed now ^_^ I installed a newer version, and it's working beautifully.  Now i can access my MSN and AIM accounts simultaniously.      One thing i'm not sure about is i'm not sure if my sound mixing is working any more...  I turned off all gaim noises, but they weren't working correctly anyways.  ^_^ Everything is good now.  I think i'm going to boot into windows pretty soon though, these linux fonts really kill the eyes.  Need to change them desperately.      Lates
