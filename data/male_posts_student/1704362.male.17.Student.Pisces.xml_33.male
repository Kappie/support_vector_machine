But I'll jack up taxes, entangle you with dozens of stupid nitpicky little laws, and violate your rights in order to protect you from yourself.    OR     Vote for me!  I'll lower taxes and protect you from the liberals trying to take away your privacy and freedom of expression.   Unless, of course, you abuse this freedom and privacy by being a homosexual, a feminist, a minority, or in any other way fail to conform to our idea of how our God wants you to be.
