I guess I have been sleeping in some sense of the word, but it's not a deep sleep, full of dreams and continous wakings. I can't believe I still dream about her as much as I do. I haven't even had a real conversation with her in over two years, and yet there she is, in my dreams once every three or four weeks. I heard she was moving to Texas, and though I harbour no romantic feelings for her and never talk to or see her, it still makes me a little sad to know that she's going to be that far away. To me, she is the direct link back to one of the best summers of my life. Yes, the summer was full of emotions, some of them good, and some of them bad, and really, I don't know what I was thinking, things could have been fantastic if it hadn't been for my refusal, or perhaps lack of courage to kiss the girl. Story of my life you know. Two amazing, beautiful girls, both lost to me because I couldn't find the nerve to kiss them. Well, I suppose that's how things go when you're young. And stupid. Ah well, so the cookie crumbles, and anyway, I am happy with the way the last two years have turned out. Perhaps minus the last three of four months, but what happens happens, and you must just move on.   Crystal updated in her journal sometime last night, and I'm glad to hear that she's been doing well. It seems that everywhere she goes, people fall in love with her. She never saw it before, and she would never believe me when I told her that everyone did love her. She is perfect. She does have a lot to offer the right person, and is great in many other areas as well...hm. I'm glad to hear that she's ok. (and about Mike Diemand, that turd *evil cackle*). Guh.  Well, I guess I should drag my ass out of bed and do something constructive. I have a huge AssMan training binder sitting on my table that I should go through. Hooray for Assistant Managers. Gag.
