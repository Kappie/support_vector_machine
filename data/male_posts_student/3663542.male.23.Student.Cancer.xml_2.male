K so maybe I'm not that bad but in the past week and a half I have come up on 3 accidents immediately after they happened. Luckily I don't think anyone has died from them (well, not while I was there) but they have augmented in severity. The first was a guy fell off his motorcycle and went sliding down the road with his bike beside him; I actually saw that one. The next one involved two cars meeting on a really bad set of curve on this road her in Sylacauga; don't know as much about that one, but I was like the 5th or 6th car there.  Then today when I was coming home from a YSA conference in Huntsville, I was going down 208 and came up on another one. This one I didn't actually see, but that was because the cars in front of me were obscuring my view. But I was one of the first cars there, and so I stopped and I saw this man from behind where I parked running toward one of the two cars involved that was on its side. So I got out and went the same way he was running to see what I could do to help, by the time I was over there the man and several women were trying to push the truck that was on its side back over. My first thought was that it was a odd thing to do because the police would want to see things as the were left by the accident, however they were screaming something about a man being trapped, and then I saw why it was necessary. A man had been thrown from the truck, and now the truck was on top of him. I immediately started to help to right the truck and free the man, and luckily one or two more fellows showed up right behind me and we were able to push the truck back over. At this I could see the man, he look in pretty bad shape, I thought for sure he was dead or about to die, but I didn't have much time to think about that because the original man that was there was trying to get the truck door open, and was saying something about getting a woman out of the truck; I helped him with no avail with the doors until he jumped in the open window to try and pass the lady out... The lady in the truck was down in the floor, I didn't notice she was in there till then, I had no idea about her when we righted the truck, but her then I noticed her legs were poking out of the window so I went around and tried to help get her out, but the other two men were there and had her legs, and the man in the truck was lifting her head up and out. Once out of the truck we took the lady over to the side of the road and set her in the grass. From here the women who were there were awesome, they found rags and blankets to put under there heads and tried to comfort them and take care of the two as best they could. I stayed around in case there was something I could do, so the best thing I could think of at the time was to help direct traffic, as this was blocking both sides of 280.  Shortly before the paramedics arrived a surgeon showed up and started checking the two people, however the paramedics arrived really quite fast and started helping. I believe the girl in the other car was alright for the most part, apparently after it happened she got out of her car and staggered over to the median, but she was just really shaken. Well eventual the police came and more paramedics, like I said the guy was in a bad shape, and they decided to get a helicopter in and airlift him out. We kept traffic moving as long as we could but eventually we stopped both sides of 280 to allow the helicopter to land on the highway, and so the cops could take pictures and mark where the cars were. By the time the helicopter got there they had striped the man down and put a blanket on him to check him for internal bleeding and the like. We also found out sometime that the man had palsy and was in a wheelchair, witch we found in the road. Eventual the got the man air lifted out and the woman in an ambulance. While they were still taking pictures the sheriff of Shelby county came over to me and the original man that was helping, and thanked us for what we had done, and told us we did the right thing in getting the truck off the man and the woman out, then he gives us all these coin like things that are kinda neat. Luckily the also let us go before they let the rest of the cars that were waiting to get through go. However in my rush to see what I could do, I had left my lights on, SO I had to go back out and get a officer to come over and jump my car off, I don't think he minded too much because of the circumstances. Anyway, wow...  Well that's a chunk of text, but I figure its alright, I just wanted to get it all out. If I keep coming up on accidents like this I may need to change my e-mail address. But seriously I wonder if there is something else I could do in situations like that. I mean I don't think they were members, but should I have offered them a blessing, or the woman at least (she was more aware of what was going on). The thought passed though my mind briefly while I was there, and I dismissed it and said a silent prayer instead. But I always wonder what more I could do in situations like that. Maybe I should brush up on my first aid, and trama treatment, especially if this keeps up. Perhaps there is something I should learn from this. This just reaffirms what I already do, in that we should always wear our seatbelts!!! I already do, but after this past month, what I've seen... wow...  other than that my weekend was good, the conference was good, and I enjoyed myself, meet some people, and such. It was odd b/c I spent most of the weekend with people I didn't know before, not typical thing I would do. Anyway I don't feel much like typing about that now sooo. Ill leave it at it was fun, meet some good people, had fun dancing and yeah... I enjoyed it. Perhaps more on that later, but don't hold your breath... But I should sleep, 'cause I didn't do much of that this weekend, if you know what I mean! (so I cant sleep on a flat mattress...)
