"We take ideas that are fresh and inspired and turn them into something trite and accessible!"  "Don't forget to clip the shopping tag!" -- a man from the Home Shoplifting Network  "Don't you all think the recent explosion of choice in cable channels has resulted in a wealth of new quality television that no one has ever experienced before? ...

Being too trusting will get you easily hurt.   urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    that's kinda impressive actually...
