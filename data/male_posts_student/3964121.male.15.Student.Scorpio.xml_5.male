Usually I have an incredibly dull summer filled with well drought and boredom, but this summer, for some odd and unknown reason, is far better. I know someone who said "It's because you grew, in height". I definitely don't think this is it. Is it the fact that I have friends, no I had friends last summer as well. So maybe it's the fact that I have something to do all the time. But now that I think of it, having something to do with my time, isn't fun at all. I really am now beginning to enjoy the times when I can sit on a swing and watch the rain fall, or (such as I did last night) watch the sheets of lightning brighten the sky like God was flicking the lightswitch. This is my first post so I will leave it short. This is the end.
