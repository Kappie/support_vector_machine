On the other hand French is going to be a great diversion and I'm going north on saturday (with Ian, Si, Seth, Bruce, and ofcourse one of our gracious hosts, Ross).     Last night I went to a show at Nevin's which was really loud but highly enjoayable (even though I kept away from the mosh pit with my tevas on).  The music was somewhat better than I expected and things were generally peachy ignoring my ickiness and leaving early.  The most interesting thing with going to concerts for me is that I'm always struck with sudden and highly random philisophical thought, unless I'm about to get knocked flat on my bum.  Last night that though came in the form of a question:  How and why are mosh pits different from your average angry mob?  Mosh pits themselves are a lot like mobs, a big (or slightly less big) group of people who have come together in a common idea, get the crap beat out of you in good fun.  Most mobs start out peacefully then become raging and violent, mosh pits are simply violent (in the best possible conception, but still violent).  In mosh pits there always seems to be a communal spirit that dictates goodwill, if somone falls, pick them up.  I'll keep thinking about it when I'm feeling a bit clearer (and maybe write followup), but I just think it's interesting to compare the two. [/babble] have a nice day.
