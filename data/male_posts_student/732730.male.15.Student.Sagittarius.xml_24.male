Except that I was re-breathing second hand smoke from their incessant smoking :|!  Anywho, after that we went to Jeans West and I bought some new jeans and some tees. I gotta look good for my baby when I go down.  Speaking of Kieran, he texted me today and said Adam im really confused at the moment just about everything anyway ill call you tonight. And Adam says "Dubya Tee Eff, mate?" I mean, fuck! He says he loves me all the time. He called me while I was having my cappucino to say "I Love You", and then not 20 minutes after we hang up I get a message saying he's not sure about us.  What the fuck?  He's calling me tonight, so I'll sort it out then, I hope. I'm freakin coming down in less than two weeks, and he springs this shit on me now? Fuck man.  While I was waiting for the bus I had a deep'n'meaningful with Ellen. She said that the same thing happened between her and Steven, so it's good that I'm not the only one. She also said that Rex likes her more than she likes him, even though they seem to be all over eachother (from what I'm told). She said that if Steven were to move to Cairns, she'd ditch Rex like that (not nice, but pfft). Steven sounds hot, too :D.  I hope things are ok with Kieran and I. I love him to bits, and I don't want anything to come between us!
