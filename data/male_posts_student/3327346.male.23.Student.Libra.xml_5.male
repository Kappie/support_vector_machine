I ordered some food at a drive-through today and said hello to the worker at the window. The reply I received was an abrupt “what do you want?”        Friendly to say the least, but how has the public changed. Supposedly,  you are a product of your surroundings. If that's so, when you are depressed, annoyed, unhappy, and just plain miserable, how might that affect your attitude in your professional life?     When on goes to the doctor’s office and hopes to be confronted with comfort, warmth or even to feel a since of well being, imagine what the attitude would be if   the doctor only cares about the co-pay or the amount of patients that are being seen.  We know not everyone reacts in such a manner, but I often wonder why so many people have a poor attitude everyday.       What I am saying is that we need to set the precedent for future generations, not only for those entering the healthcare professions.   It seems that everything is taken for granted, and too many people do not enjoy the simple pleasures of life anymore. For those of us who are health care students, we have an obligation. We entered the field to help those in need, and or to make sure that those servicing the needy are doing it correctly. Hopefully, healthcare students are not studying for the wrong reasons, and if they are, we have an obligation to correct them.
