In the past two days I've developed a series of pictures that I'll be working to extend in the next few days, quite possibly with sepia shots. Following that idea I may base photos on one colour and work from there, and stop limiting myself to grayscale.    Feel free to look at what I've already done, they're linked and at 1260x1024, I didn't want to go any smaller for some reason, this probably being that 1260x1024 is my screen resolution.     urlLink "Fall Over"    urlLink "STFU World"    urlLink "Maracas"    urlLink "Wasted"   Apologies to those on 56k, these may take a while to load.  Enjoy, toodles.
