Today was pretty awesome getting to hang out with Tamsen, Lise and Benita who were intentionally late for geo. so we hung out in the cafe laughed and drew pictures of penises! ha ha ha but we won't say of whom. i am now informed that we are having an end of exam party at emily's house on the 22nd..hmm i said. the 22nd is also my birthday! what a coincidence...but i have a sneaking suspicion that they already knew that. i don't care...i'm actually flattered that i have friends who know when my birthday last year. no one last year remembered my birthday...ah fuck it.  anyways i've left this blog on for so long and haven't worked on it so i guess i'm done....seeyalatabye! Sam
