From now on I'm gonna eat properly instead of having a 'computer geek' diet of crisps and chocolate and fizzy drinks!  (Even though i don't really eat them much anyway lol, I want to be healthy!)  Day has been quite interesting actually.  Nothing much has happened but the feeling in the air has been happy.  I've got quite a bit of chocolate left from the easter break but I'm only going to eat it in small amounts and probably only at each weekend so that my diet is not affected.  Last night I found this cool program which enables you to play MP3s on your GBA Flash Cartridge!  At least now I have something I can play music on for the time being.  Speaking of MP3s, Dans had a wicked MP3 Player for his birthday!  It has little logos and animations on it like the Nokia phones.  I'm jealous now :(  I took my pc apart (just a few bits) and was suprised that theres so little hardware that makes a computer possible.  The tower seemed to be making it look massive!  I've seen a cool 160GB Hard Drive on sale for Â£63!  I've decided to scrap my tower when we move and I'm gonna try my best to refurbish my computer to make it 'breathe-easy'.  I seriously can't wait to move!  Have I mentioned that already?  I'm so excited...!
