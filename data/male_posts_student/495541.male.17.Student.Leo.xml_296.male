The station is called Smooth Jazz.  I think it's helping me a bit, to be honest.  They say that classical music does something to your mind but I think jazz'll do it to you as well.  Things are boring around here with nothing to do and no job.  I'm wondering what I'm going to do tomorrow.  I've got nothing planned.  Basketball stuff'll start on Tuesday.  I was bored today so I went to Wal-mart to see if they had Sega GT Online.  It has something like 30 new cars.  I wasn't able to find a list online.  It's a sham they don't list the cars on the Sega website.  They're probably afraid I won't buy the game if there are cars I don't like or no good ones they added.  I'd buy the game anyways because I liked Sega GT 2002 so much.  From now on, during the summer I'm going to take a lot of pictures.  I'm going to take pictures of just random stuff as well.  Just stuff I do everyday.  It'll be boring, but at least I'll have some proof I actually did stuff during the summer.  It's always a good thing to get actual use out of the costly electronic stuff I bought over the years as well.  I've got nothing more.  Go visit my  urlLink deviantART  page.  I'll post my more artistic pictures there.  Edit: Yesterday, I took apart my Xbox and put it back together.  I took it apart actually 3 times.  The first two times I just took apart the top and hard drive and DVD-ROM.  The third time I took out the motherboard.  I hooked it back up today and it still works. :)
