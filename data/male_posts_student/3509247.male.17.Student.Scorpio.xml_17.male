The night before I only got 4 hrs or sleep so I was shot.  I had a great time but it wasn't much of an amusement park.  It's more of just a water park; although the unlimited softdrinks is a major plus.  I found a new drink that I think is awesome:  3 parts root beer and one part mountain dew.  It's really good.  It's like some kinda erbal tangy root beerish drink.  Ok, now onto today...  Baisically today I went to set up a bank account with my mom.  This time I did have my permit so I was all set up.  After that, we went to some other places to pick up some stuff.  Once we got back from that, I fell back asleep for a few hours.  My mom woke me back up to eat dinner and then I got on my cpu.  I played literati with this lady I met before yesterday.  It's so awesome because she's a Christian lady and she's really nice.  The killer is that her name is Sheri and that's all I have to go by.  Because of this I get her mixed up with Mrs. Prosch (Bre's mom's name is Sherrie), not that I call Mrs. Prosch by her first name, but she's the first Sherrie I've known is her so that's what comes to my mind first.  At any rate after that I saw Oceans 11.  Oh my goodness that movie is awesome.  It's about these 11 people, led by Daniel Ocean, who rob a safe in a casino.  You'll have so see how smooth the operation is.  I'd encourage anyone to watch it.  I also saw Desperado and the Mask of Zorro.  Both of those were really good so watch any three of those if you get the chance.  There is one awkward scene in both Zorro and Desperado so be forewarned.  We fastforwarded past two parts in Ocean's 11, but I don't think they were bad scenes; I wouldn't know because I didn't get to see them.  They were really quick though so I don't really know.  In any case, I'm supposed to be in bed now so I'll holla at you guys lata.  The guy who now knows how to rob a safe in Vegas, Joshua R. Guynn (you don't know me if they're looking for me ok?)
