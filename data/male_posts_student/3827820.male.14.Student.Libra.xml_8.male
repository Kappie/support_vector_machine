Something to note... today is a Thursday, a very bad hair day to me (because there's lots of lessons to attend!)  Nothing more to say, except some description for today: CRAPPY...  Teddy-O-Ted, good-and-bad!  *Tips of the day - Share your feeling with people around the world via blog! Nice way duh!
