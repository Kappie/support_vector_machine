I would get up at like 1ish.. but my dad comes running in @ like 12 every day and says "Get the fuck up".. and im "urrr...nooo...  - Goo away and shut my door".. But yesterday i got up at 8:00 and the day felt realllyyyyy realllyyyyy realllyyy long.. So i've decided that from now on im gonna get up at hrm.. 9:00 - does that sound okay? Good..  Anyway i woke up with an idea this morning.. I'm gonna make a program later (After i've done some revision) that lets you post bloggs to your account straight from your desktop with 1 click, without even having to open a internet site, sign in or anything...  For all you GuRu's out there.. Does anybody know where i can get a packet sniffer that will work for a wireless network card?  I'll bbl. //CuBie out.
