You get here as a 1L, everything is new, meet new people, figure out what law school is all about, reading casebooks, checking footnotes, finding your place.  Definitely a beginning.  And there's definitely an end.  You have a job offer waiting for you, you're on your way out, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel (or the big black void, depending on your point of view, but I'm trying to keep this light today).  But what's in between?  Because the recruiting process is so early, there's kind of no middle, when you're neither on your way in or your way out.  Nothing too profound, just a thought.
