The new job: well, let's just say the title is "monitor".  Those of you on the in with the lingo might know what I'm talking about; otherwise, just imagine a small, gated community that caters to very wealthy people with a specific malady.  That's right: I'll be working for a hospital of sorts!  It'll be a good job, because I'll get paid to do what I do already.  Lots of socializing involved, not too much stress.  Hopefully it'll supplement the school and tutoring nicely, although it sounds like it's going to add a lot of sheer hours to my days.  The job came out of nowhere.  A friend called, and asked if I was making enough money tutoring.  I told him I'd always be happy to make more, he gave me a phone number to call, and viola, it happened like that.  I'm indebted to The Israeli once again.  The last time was for the prosciutto -- now it's for a position in the residence!  Well, we'll see.  Everything is temporary and nothing is certain, so I might as well not get ahead of myself.  I start my next battery of summer classes tomorrow: it's physics with a lab.  I'm not excited about it, because Mondays and Wednesdays will be 10am - 4pm days.  That really doesn't sound like a good way to spend the summer -- but I no longer deserve a summer, as I'm 23 years old.  Anyway, it's the middle of the night and I just remembered I have to cancel a camera order.  I placed an order for a new camera for Carissa, but it appears that her warranty is going to cover it after all (see the beginning of "The Fire of '04").  I'm going to try to figure out if this can be done; otherwise, it appears that I'll be getting a camera too!  That's good: I need one.  I miss taking photos for this blog.
