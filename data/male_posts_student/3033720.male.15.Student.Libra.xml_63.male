In Florida, anyone found underneath a sidewalk is guilty of disorderly conduct.      In Rumford, Maine, it's against the law to bite your landlord.      In Tennessee, it's illegal to drive a car while sleeping.      In New Jersey, it's illegal to slurp your soup.      In Marshalltown, Iowa, it's against the law for a horse to eat a fire hydrant.      So, people, I would appreciate it if you wouldn't drive while asleep. Not only is it illegal, it's morally wrong.
