I am not blogging for her, I almost regret that I have to blog-her poems are really quite humorous.  Where was I...oh yes. I had a wonderful birthday yesterday. I recieved some very nice gifts from my family and friends(oh wait, the only friends that got me anything were Val and Megan J.) The rest of you are going to burn for not indulging my greedy side, after all, it only surfaces twice a year! Onto the food "charge!". I had a really great birthday supper. We had filets, grilled peppers, salad, macaroni and cheese, Hawaiian sweet rolls, salad, asparagus(I don't like asapargus, it makes your pee smell funny), these onion things that my dad grills in which he puts garlic and butter, and texas sheet cake. My mouth is watering... I started work today. Again it is for the Secretary of State, but this year I don't have to process license plates. In fact, I don't have to do anything with license plates(this alone is cause for celebration)! I now work in the Department of Accounting and Revenue, Bureau of Department of Motor Vehicles Auditing. That's right...I get to audit the state, this means I do math all day long. I am enjoying it, air conditioning, a smoke-free building, and a state office, it can't get much better than that! The state office part refers to the laziness/ingenuity of state workers. Our office's clock is ten minutes fast, the logical person would simply set it back so we were on time with everyone else. But they are really thinkers in that office, since we are ten minutes ahead of everyone else we do everything ten minutes before anyone else gets to do it. The break rooms are empty-and the machines are still fully stocked, there are no lines to go the bathroom, we beat the lunch crowd to all the restaurants, the parking lot is a cinch to get out of, and the best part is that we get out of work ten minutes before every other state worker in the city-no rush hour traffic! The singular downside is that we have to start work ten minutes early so that no one gets in trouble, I don't care-I'm a morning person!  I want to again congratulate all of the seniors(especially Val)on graduation! By the way, in reference to the present comment earlier I was just joking. I don't expect anything from any of you and I know that I am a greedy little bastard!  Have a great morning/afternoon/evening!
