For some reason such revelations actually surprise me - I guess that deep down I just want to have a "normal" life with a "normal" perspective and "normal" relationships.  Of course, the whole "normal" paradigm is a figment of imagination (largely constructed by fanciful and/or incomplete accountings of what life should be), but I think that there are certain aspects of "normalcy" that I just don't measure up in.  Take school, for example.  One would think that I just got back from an awesome experience in DC, I'm one class from being finished with college, and I get to start law school (virtually for free!) in the fall, so I should be excited and upbeat about things!  Nope.  Quite the opposite, actually - I wasn't exactly a wild man about graduating from high school, either, but I don't even think I'm going to go to my college graduation (for what?  So I can wait for four hours for someone to call my name - which no one would recognize - and then go home and try to figure out what needs to be done around the house?).  But this total lack of excitement puzzles me somewhat - instead of gaining any sort of satisfaction from the "accomplishment" of graduating from college, I'm already focused on (worrying about?) law school and what I want to do with my career.  Just like high school, college seems like just another necessary step towards whatever future I might have, just another piece of paper I need to have signed so I can be "eligible" to do what I want to (even if I'm not sure what that is yet).    And it's all so frustrating - this mechanical perspective on everything leaves me with such a sense of malaise that I'm not even sure why I put myself through it.  I used to pride myself on how hard I worked on things, how attentive I was - now I'm just the opposite, always looking for the easiest way to do the most obvious things.  I've pretty much stuck with the whole "I've-always-wanted-to-be-a-lawyer" routine, but I'm not sure about that any more; from my experience in DC the legal (NOT justice) system is so messed up (both in procedure and practice) that I'm not sure I want to get involved in it.  More and more I've become convinced that if I go into law I want to be some type of reformer (if even in the smallest sense - maybe become a judge or something), but I just don't seem to have my heart in it.  While I was in DC I toyed with the notion of going into one of the law enforcement agencies (FBI? Secret Service?), and I've thought about going into the military before - I think it all boils down to the fact that I want to be DOING things, not simply get stuck behind a desk somewhere.  Or maybe I want to go work for the Peace Corp or for some refugee agency in some remote corner of the world - anything to feel like I'm practically helping people, not just sitting there pretending to work "in the name of justice" and really just pushing paper around to help line people's pockets.  I know some of you think I'm hopelessly idealistic and naive to think that I can try to help people instead of make money, that I need to come back to reality and just accept that this is the way the world works.  But let me just say that I think those of you who say this are the very root of everything that's wrong with our society, even moreso than the "immoral" people who think that gay marriage and abortion are ok, because I've seen more of "them" show real concern for the people who are hurting and in need than I've seen Christians do so.  I told a friend of mine the other day that I have a "love/hate relationship" with Christianity and Christians: on the one hand the message seems great and all, but on the other it seems so phony because I don't see it actually having an impact in people's lives, I don't see anyone living it.    I was reading a book entitled The Jesus I Never Knew by Philip Yancey while I was in DC; in the book Yancey goes over all the things about Christ we like to ignore, like how he was probably dirt poor, a social outcast, a political radical, a philosophical paradox, a challenge to every status quo ever invented by man.  I couldn't finish the book; everything that Yancey said about Christ, all of the things that make him so illogical, appealed to me at the most fundamental level, but I just couldn't imagine living like that in my "Christian" environment.  But I think that Yancey has it right; I think that if someone's going to follow Jesus teachings they are going to have to be a social outcast, a political radical, a philosophical paradox, and a challenge to the status quo on some level, and I just don't see any Christians actually living like that (at least, none that are willing to actually let me get close to them).  Sure, I read about some, and every once in a great while there might be a missionary floating through who will stand at the front of the church and tell great stories or an acquaintance who seems to be a little different; but where are the masses of people who should be changed by such a radical message?  I mean, if it really is everything Christians say it is, shouldn't it by a dynamic influence on society instead of being perceived as an antiquated ethos of yesteryear?  In case I haven't stood on my soap box enough, let me vent a bit more.  Maybe it's just because of the Christian crowd that I know, but I always hear everyone talking about the "horrible court cases guiding our country to destruction" or the catastrophic bent politicians are taking these days.  First, let me say that a court case is just that - a court case.  If you really stop to think about it, how has a Supreme Court decision ever pragmatically effected any of us?  And having been in Washington for the last three months and having met with a lot of the "horrible politicians" that everyone I know complains about, let me break something to you: they're good people!  In fact, many of the people that I found myself respecting most because of the things they were doing to actually try to help people were the very ones who are most hated in "my circles" (cite Rep. Kucinich, Brown, and Ryan), and the ones that I loathed for their social policies are the ones that "we" like (mainly the Bush Admin).  What I think it all boils down to is money and our (conservative) American fixation on it.  Somehow we've come up with the notion that we each need to somehow earn our health, our salary, our job, and that to give these things to someone else is somehow cheating (both them and, more importantly, ourselves).  In fact, it's worse than cheating, it's stealing; what gives them the right to demand us to pay for their inadequacies with our hard-earned money (be it through higher taxes or through other forms of wealth redistribution)?!    Well, my answer is quite simple:  you don't give enough of your money away to help these people when they don't ask for it, so now they have to demand it to survive and compete in the world you've created!  However, let me first point out the flaws in the basic reasoning: no one earns their health(care), which is dictated by God and circumstance; very few actually earn their salaries, especially compared with what most people on earth make, and a lot of wealth is transferred through non-wage methods like inheritances and trust funds anyway; and the old adage that "it's who you know, not what you know" certainly holds true about people's positions, so most don't really "earn" those, either.  But let's assume for a second that most people did "earn" what they have.  Well, if these people were Christians, then I think that their perspective on what they use their money, positions, etc. for should change, should differ from the way "the world" sees things.  Over and over in the Bible I hear about unconditional love, turning the other cheek, going the extra mile, giving away the extra cloak, pooling resources for the communal good, "going low" to help those less fortunate; so where's all the money and resources going?  I mean, I realize that Christians are a minority in this country and all, but I still think that we should be able to make a bigger dent on society than we are!  I mean, where's the money for the homeless shelters (right now there are over 1000 homeless people in DC the shelters can't hold); where's the money for AIDS research (all the arguments about it being a "moral" disease are garbage - they're people who need help, and we ought to help and love them regardless of what disease they have or how they got it); where's the money for drug or alcohol abuse programs, or prisoner release programs, or juvenile offender programs?  And more importantly, where's the people dedicated to these problems and so many more like them?!  Perhaps the thing that hurt me most in DC was what I didn't see (and the same holds true for Akron and Cleveland and my general perception of the rest of the US): I didn't see Christians sacrificing their careers and other things to "go low" and take positions where they actually helped people.  I didn't meet a single Christian in the Public Defender's office; I didn't meet a single Christian asking the government for more money for homeless shelters, treatment programs, prison reform, or other lower-class social issues; I didn't meet a single Christian who went down into the inner city and tried to help the thousands hooked on drugs or alcohol, who are from broken families where they don't even know who their father is, or whose entire neighborhoods are caught in an endless cycle of violence and incarceration.  Now in fairness I claim ignorance about the last point - I passed by many black churches I could tell were really trying to help their communities and never went into any of them.  But where's the support from those that have the ability to give it?!  Now some might say that it's irresponsible for a Christian man (or woman) to hurt their family (either the one they have or the one they might have) by taking such traditionally low-wage positions, some of which may be downright dangerous.  My retort is simply this:  who else is going to do it and what makes it more "logical" or "right" for a non-Christian person to do so?  One of the things that I've heard many Christians talk about is how there is a "fundamental morality" inherent in each person that doesn't need to be explained or taught; however, many of the tenants of this "fundamental morality" Christ proclaimed are better understood and practiced by many of the secular people I know (who don't know that Christ said a word about them) than by most of the Christians I know.  What makes it somehow all right for them to heed their internal calling and wrong for us (and more specifically, I) to ignore like urges in the face of explicit commands?!  Well, enough ranting for one night.  This blog certainly didn't go the way I thought it would - I didn't even get to talk about my social ineptness or utter loneliness, but I suppose those can be foregone for another day (I know you're all just looking forward to THAT :P).  But anyway...if anyone ever feels the need to get into a nice fight, I suppose I gave you a couple of good buttons to push with me here, eh?
