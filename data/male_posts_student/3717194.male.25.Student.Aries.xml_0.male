Do you know when metal detectors were useful? The day they came out. Do you know when metal detectors became useless? The day after that.    Do the security folks seriously think that the only materials that can be used to make weapons are metals? What is even stupider is that not even all metals set the thing off….I’ll be damned if I know which ones do and which ones don’t, but if I was a bad guy, I would probably find out.   The point of all this is not to expose the metal detector as a useless piece of junk (which it pretty much is), but rather to expose a fundamental principle of the “War on Terror” or more generally the “War on preventing someone from doing something really mean if they really want to do it bad enough.” Just as viruses, other infectious agents, and other illnesses manage to keep finding a way to make us sick despite our best medical attempts to stop them, terrorists, assholes, and crazies will always find a way to do mean things. They will dodge the metal detector as HIV dodges Retrovir(R); they will hide in the shadows of our country as a tumor hides in the shadow of an MRI.    All of this may sound a bit defeatist. I am not saying that we cannot stop terror attacks any more than I would ever say that we could not find a cure for HIV. They will build up our country’s immune system by repeatedly testing our defenses. If we are lucky, 9/11 was the vaccine that will cure the disease; hopefully, we will not need a booster shot. urlLink
