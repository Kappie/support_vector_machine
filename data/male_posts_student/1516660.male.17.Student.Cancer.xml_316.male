Maybe that's because I went out early today.  Hmm. Today in my OG, I made new friends. Heh Heh. If Lit Ping hasn't talked to me first (ask to see my form), I wouldn't have hanged out with him, Yong Joo and Yao Long. Heh Heh. I really liked this group more. Maybe because last time I was forever hanging out with MingYao only, I didn't enjoy myself with the group. This time, I bonded with mah group. O.O What a meowing time.  Hmm. The first activity for our clan (Olympus) is mass dance. O.O Hmm. This time my partner is great. I mean, as in not as worse as the pervious cats. HaHa. We laughed a lot at each other's mistakes. Heh Heh. Anyhoo, we were given a break.  Heh Heh. The four of us stuck together each time. Heh. Anyhoo, we brought uniforms during our break and resulted in us being late to the tribe meeting. HeH HeH.   OO! The games were played next. Hmm. Our tribe lost in every game sia! So sway! Anyway, I had a great time. Yeah. Heh Heh. Unexpected wor. I usually don't like Orientation games. O.O Hmm. After games, we went for lunch.   HaHa. A lot of cats went off leh, and only left we four guys and some girls. After lunch, we measured height and weight. Wel, I grew by 1am and 0.6kg. That's horrible! After measurements were done, we went for Clan Time.   Clan Time was meowing. Hmmm. We played more games. Ayioh!! I lost in a game you know! As a forfeit, I have to belly-dance. So embarassing!!! HaHaHa!! Even ducks meowed. After games, there was the school tour. O.O Even the shcool tour is meowing!   Hmm. After touring the school, we went back to the hall to sing some songs. Ayioh...sor boring. Hmmm. When we left, I forgot to say goodbye to mah group. Oh well.   Hmm. Lit Ping is from HK. Hmm. I couldn't tell at first, until Joy asked. Hmm. I wonder if he knows how to speak Cantonese. Must ask tomorrow. Hmm. Yes. I went home with WQ, CQ, Janet and Gloria. Me and the two girls got off at Admiralty and walked to 768. I met my Dad there and ate dinner.   Hmm. I came back, bathed and came online. Oh! I went off to watch TV. Oh Carol is aboslutely tuching today! Oh my god...Allan is so sweet! He proposed to Carol! Oh my god...the perfect ending! So touching!  Hmm. I think I am ending this. Sorry for sounding really rushed, but I am getting distracted by a really good Snape fic. O.O Yes! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
