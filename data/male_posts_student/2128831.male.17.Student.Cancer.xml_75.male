Ah!  To Fabi, my boi, I heart you!  Dis’ weekend should rock!  Lol, I will be so out of Necedah.com!    You only wanted to dance with me 'cause you're lone again But I heard you whispering things that I want forget Suddently we kissed and we were spinning around I feel for you and when I look into your eyes I decide that everything's gonna be alright All the time And when I look into your eyes I decide that everything's gonna be alright all the time I know it's not even reality to you But I'm trembling every morning when I wake up thinking of you I'm thinking about you too So send me a light I feel for you and when I look into your eyes I decide that everything is gonna be alright All the time 'Cause when I look into your Eyes I decide that everything is gonna be al-right All the time And when I look into your eyes I decide Everything is gonna be alright All the time All the time   An open letter to the person who wrote the hateful email at work, then accidentally sent it to the wrong recipient:  Hi,  I got your e-mail a few minutes ago. You say that you would rather slit your wrists "with jagged glass than ever work with those such idiots on.  Prom Committee. " Since I work on the as chair, and since you took the time from your busy schedule to compose and send me your feelings, I must consider your correspondence a "cry for help." And I want you to know that I'm here for you. I must also ask you one very serious question: What's stopping you? I'm sure you realize that your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for ultimate self-sacrifice could be also your inalterable ultimatum for those OTHER Prom numbskulls who fail to appreciate your demigod-like mastership of all things technically correct. Since you called out to me in your time of distress, let me offer your some heart-felt support: Be the person of principle that you say you are! Exclaim your superior creative intellect to the world! Like you suggested in your email, I agree that before "the act" you should decorate your bathroom with roses or dead animals or how about the carcasses of your 12 cats, stuffed into a rose-shaped potpourri basket! And, while you're at it, why not write something meaningful or religious, in your own blood, as you slowly bleed to death? Imagine the possibilities! And imagine those unappreciative fiends, gasping in disbelief as the read your last words: "I TOLD YOU I WAS SERIOUS!" or "BOW TO THEE, HEATHENS!" or "COPY EDITORS DO IT WITH STYLE!"  That'll show 'em.     [5 Minutes on Getting it All Figured Out]   I honestly do believe that some folk wake up on his or her 8th birthday and stare at the ceiling and say, Holy shit, I totally want to be a banker, or a school teacher, or a stock broker. Or, a fireman. Unfortunately I believe that overwhelming majority of people grew up in houses where parents did something shitty, see part time retail, or something really boring, see account executive or CPA. Before we truly understand the value of money, despite what anyone says a person does not learn the value of money until he or she pays his or her own bills, we cannot associate "what do we want to be when we grow up" with a lucrative title. So what happens to us? We wake up one day when we're 18, when we're 22, when we're 38, when we're 64 and we realize that STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK WE WANT TO DO WITH OUR LIVES. I'm trying to decide what's worse for me right now. Coming to grips with the fact that I may not have the smarts, money, family, ambition, work ethic to achieve my dreams or if I never really had a dream to begin with. Tomorrow will I wake up as a failure or just another tax payer who likes to treat himself to hot wings once in a while? That'll give you some insomnia.
