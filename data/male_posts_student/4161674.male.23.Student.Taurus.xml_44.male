       
      Lives-living, hopes-dimming, deceit drains the Light.  False-witness, titanic-fitness, division hits the Ground.  Water-wash, unexpected-loss, devil’s diggin’ the Fight.  Grand-design, lunacy-prime, darkness-pits the Sound.  Thief-parade, bawdiness-displayed, desire-drenches the Flight.  Dark-day, passion-frayed, destiny-determines the Round.
