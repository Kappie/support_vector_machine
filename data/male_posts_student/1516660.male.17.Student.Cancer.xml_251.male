I felt like puking most of the time. I was sleeping on the lower bunk, and everytime the train moves, the empty upper bunk would rattle like crazy. When I tried sleeping on the upper bunk, the man opposite me was snoring like hell. Therefore, I got very little sleep.  What I did was self appoint myself as the "sleeping conductor-cum-door keeper". I kept mkaing sure my friends were all asleep ('cept for KS, he couldn't sleep and we talked). We were sleeping near the door entrace to our carriage. People walk past often and always didn't close the door. When that happens, the loud wind would be blowing into our cabin. Sheez. I made sure doors were closed each time they were opened.  In the end, I got about 3 hours of sleep. Yeah. That's how bad it was. The others, who got way way MORE sleep time, blamed me for their little amount of sleep and making them lose a potenial hour of sleep. Well, except for CQ and KS. Sheez. I was reminded of it throughout the entire day. Basically, I was being ostrasized. The unfairness of things. I can't sleep, they slept more. Yet, I was blamed for their "little" sleep time. Sigh.  The train made seceral stops and we had to get down at Woodlands checkpoint to get our passports scanned.  The trian arived at KL at 7am. We were met by Hann's 2nd aunt and his grandmother. Hann's father and youngest aunt arrived to fetch us from the treacherous rain.  We went to Hann's place, rest for a bit and went out for brunch.  Brunch, ban mian, was spoilt by Hann, who added chilli to my noodles. I DETEST PEOPLE MESSING WITH MY FOOD! 2 things surprised me. One, almost all the Chinese in KL speaks Cantonese. Great for me, no languade barriers and all. It's wasn't so good for the others, who can't speak Cantonese. Hmm. Two, the things there are half the price in Singapore. In Singapore, ban mian costs S$2.50, but in KL, it costs RM2.50 (S$1.25). Wow...  After that, we went shopping in Mines City. XC brought a shirt and Hann came up with this idea to wear the same shirt to Genting (to ostrasize WQ la....).  We went to this mall, which is totally boring. I even forgot the name. How insignificant.   After that, we went into Mid Valley to shop.  I spotted MPH bookshop! Oh my god! I cna buy my books! Charmed books were in abundance!! So were Artermis Fowl! They were even cheaper than in Singapore, about $1-2 lesser. O.o!!  The rest came in and they were pretty angry at me. XC grabbed my neck and shook me hard. I almost fell. He's so....violent. They went out after I dismissed them.  I felt kinda hurt by their actions, especially XC. I never knew he's that cruel. Yeah. I even dismissed the idea of buying Mirror Image to go look for them. While walking the huge huge mall, I was kinda angry and so much wanted to burst out at them ('cept CQ and KS...they did nothing wrong. See ar, whenever I refer to "them", the term usually excludes CQ and KS). I managed to calm down and keep my temper in check. Ha! Anger management lesson from Wendy is helping. Heh.  I found them at Tropicana Life. They were buying clothes and I was forced to buy one too. (Given future circumstances, I should have brought my book instead. It was way more useful. At least the book is not meant to ostrasize.) Therefore, I ended up paying RM31.90.  For dinner, we ate stingray plus sotong plus clams. I tried to buy drinks, but the Malay lady couldn't understand English. I had to ask KS to translate for me (and was ridiculed once again for sucking at basic conversational Malay. HELLO! I never learnt Malay. I am not going to either. I don't see a use for it in Singapore.) Sigh....why can't English be used? It is, after all, a global language.  I realized that the malls don't carry superglue. I need it to fix my loose soles. I finally found one at Jusco in Mid Valley. What a severe lack of superglue.   I knew I said this earlier, but I am really upset that I was being treated as an extra. I was reminded of that fact constantly too (Then, why bother inviting an extra to the KL trip?). I was being ostrasized. It's not a good feeling AT ALL. Everything I say is wrong, everything I do is wrong. Everything about me is wrong. I should have turned back at Tanjong Pagar and take a taxi back home. You know how horribly I was treated? How terrible I felt? I wanted to break down more than once, but I controlled.I began to sympathize with Yit Kai, Hann's brother, who was hated by Hann. I know how it feels lor. I wish I can have someone to pour out my feelings to. I tried telling Wendy, but I can't, due to the presence of my friends. You, my blog, are me bestest friend. Thanks for listening.  I think I better turn in now, or else I can't sleep. I already had a secere lack of sleep today morning. I need ample rest. So, yeah, see ya tomorrow. Night blog.
