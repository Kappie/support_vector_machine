If I catch whoever did it, I'm going to rip their head off and shit down their neck, Duke Nukem style, ffs!    I got a new phone though, it's a  urlLink Nokia 6230 , and it's sweeeeet. Pity I need to buy a data cable or a bluetooth dongle for my computer in order to use it to its full potential though =(    Oh, and that wonderful Simpsons quote, "put it in 'H'!" will never be the same to me again after this weekend ;-)
