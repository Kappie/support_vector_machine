I then continued this dicussion with Giles (my roommate) the same night.  Peer pressure.  Here I am, in one of the more expensive public schools in the country, and supposedly the best.  So what role does peer pressure play?  Firstly, there is no active peer pressure for one to lose one's virginity, or to smoke, for example.  People are more intelligent than to do that.  But there is still a definate necessity with most people to appear 'cool'.  Being cool no longer involves smoking in our year group, thank God, and I have gone out with people who were smoking and I wasn't.  And it was fine.  Yet there seems to be a need to conform - we have a 'string-bag crew' at school, who obviously wear string bags and hang around and laugh at those who don't (not only not wearing string bags, who generally aren't 'cool').  But what is cool?  I know for a fact that there are different groups of 'cool' people each making the others out to be sad.  There are some who positively take pride in being uncool, maybe being a geek.  But I am neither cool nor a geek.  I tend to float around in the middle of it all, speaking to and befriending whoever I wish, regardless of social status.  As it turns out, most of my friends are at the 'uncool' end of the spectrum, because the more cool people do not wish to be seen with them, and me when I have become one of them.  Yet individually they are nice people.  I have had lengthy, deep conversations with some of these cool people on an individual basis, and I have enjoyed their company.  So why this change?  I put it down to two things.  Firstly, a desire to make more friends so that life is not boring.  So you like a guy, and you want to get in with his 'crew'.  So you adopt their mannersisms.  This is where the passive peer pressure comes in.  While these groups are not actively persuding people to do things they do not want to, they are nonetheless having an effect on people and influencing their decisions.  Secondly, I put it down to cowardice.  Plain, simple cowardice.  We all have a choice of who our friends are.  Some of us, including me I hope, choose our friends because of who they are, and we can get on with them and be honest, and be ourselves.  Some however, desire to get in with a cool group, and they will laugh along with everyone else at a less cool person, because deep down they are scared that they will be the next target.  I observed a few weeks ago someone taking the piss out of people with the strength of character to express themselves in an msn screen-name.  He said 'be yourself... comme tout le monde.'  This is utter bollocks.  Everyone is not being myself, they are being themselves.  But apparently being yourself is now being conformist.  And, no doubt sad.  It seems that people in these 'crews' do themselves want to be seen as rebellious, or different.  I felt deeply sorry for the guy with that screen-name.  The above is only my interpretation of certain people, and I appreciate that for many people this is not the case at all.  This is just my view of some, and I may even be wrong about them.  But this is how I see it.  Feel free to post comments opposing this argument.  I shall leave you with one thought:  Isn't rebelling the most conformist thing a teenager can do?
