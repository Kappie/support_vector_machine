We swapped the tickets for cash and just went to the pub and Burger King and played pool. Yemate. I played three games and won one. Also had my favourite crisps in the world. So yeah... was great! Mandy's behind me right now playing the Sims. I swear to God, she loves it. But it's so sweet. She's made a family called 'Hartley' and in it, there's Matt, Laila and a little kid (he was a mistake...). It's like she's playing God and she's been spending ages making the perfect villa type building for us, including a greenhouse. I wonder if any Gibbs' will start wandering around it like at Mandy's college?! My GOD, I hope so. Imagine seeing a simulated Gibbs? That'd rule a little. I discovered two great bands yesterday... one of which got reccomended to me months ago. They are As I Lay Dying and The Agony Scene. Pure hardcore. It's such a good genre! So yeah... Mandy's getting into computer games a lot lately. She keeps playing the Sims and Harry Potter! She's better than me actually. That's because I spend my time on more creative things such as sleeping and watching the TV. Well, I rarely watch the TV unless there's something I really like on it. And I don't like many programs. I like dumb-ass humour shows like Dirty Sanchez, Moronic, Ripleys and sometimes Jackass, but that's just getting old now. But I do spend a lot of time watching music channels. Because I am unemployed and I am a slob-ass =) - and now I'm gonna go snoggify Mandy's face mateeee!
