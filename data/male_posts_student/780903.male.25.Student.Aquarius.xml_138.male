Epstein will be the youngest GM in baseball history, just ahead of Randy Smith, who was 29 when hired by the Padres in 1993."  When I was a college freshman, I remember noticing that there was a major league baseball player younger than I was.  And that pretty much ended any hope of that.  Now it looks like I've only got about 5 more years until there's a general manager younger than me too.  I guess after that the next set of people to look at will be the owners... and after that, I guess I'll just have to admit it's not gonna happen....
