And then I finished my vinyl collection of said man with a trip to chicago.  Weezer took up a good deal of the week.  For hardcore fans, the "digitally remastered" version of Blue really isn't anything and trust me, my ears are sharp.  The bonus stuff is cool, but since I'm apparently a very ravenous collector I had most every song on it.  And I wouldn't have known the difference between the "origianal" SIAS and the other version if it weren't for the liner notes.  (but the difference is there).  Apparently there are bout 7 weeks left in my undergrad career.  And I've been contemplating how much I've missed out on.  I'm scared of the future, but things have to get better.  Right?
