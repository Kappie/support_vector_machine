In response my brother said "So the cops bust into someone's house and say "We're arresting you you and you for smoking dope and you for your hair."" It was funny.  Anyways, have you ever noticed that only the broken paper towel despenser always works? There's like, four in a row and one has a broken handle so only the metal part sticks out. That's the only one that never jams and always has towels in it. Ironic, no?  Also- there's this car there that has a third of the front bumper torn off at my work and it looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger from T2 when part of his face is missing. It's so weird that the resemblance between a Sable and Ahnold is so striking.  Lack of cash update: Camp: Complete! Comp: It's not gonna cost what I thought it would, but still- patience, patience... Car Insurance: I have no idea other than more than I want to pay. Magic Cards: I have the cash, I need the time to find cheap ones. And I need to borrow the credit card...  ------------------------------------- (8:56) I got so sidetracked. Did you know that Darksteel Colossus has "If Darksteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, reveal Darksteel Colossus and shuffle it into its owner's library instead"??? Man, that rocks.
