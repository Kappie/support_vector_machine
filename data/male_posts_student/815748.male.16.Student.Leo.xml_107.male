I got his number from two different sources, and I called it twice, and she said I had the wrong number.  Then I asked him in person, and it was the right number.  Darn those French putains.  2. "Something's Gotta Give" is such a horrible movie.  Don't ever see it.  But see "21 Grams," that was great.  Oh also I heard that "Blueberry" is the worst movie ever.  Don't see that either.  3. OK, I have one last opportunity, and six potential days in which to use it.  No pressure.
