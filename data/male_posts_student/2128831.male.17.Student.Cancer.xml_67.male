Nothing says (insert expletive here) like the unexpected and uninvited ringing of the doorbell. I swear I can tell when it's someone at the door trying to sell me something just by the sound of the damn thing. It's not the regular doorbell sound that you hear when children come to the door selling chocolate bars or cookies for their schools. No, it's an evil, spine-tingling sound straight from Transylvania that says "I want your blood, but I'll settle for your credit card." Oh, almost forgot the evil, cackling laughter. "HAA, HAa, Haa, haa, ha..." Whatever it is, I don't want it. I have all the appliances, insurance and religion I'll ever need. As for the Girl Scouts and their cookies, well, nobody's perfect. Exemption granted. But what's a guy to do when the soliciting demon approacheth? As much as I love my house I have no desire to cower behind permanently deadbolted doors for the rest of my life.  I thought about putting a bear trap outside the front door, but do you know how hard it is to clean one of those things? No thanks. Electrifying the doorbell button seemed like a novel approach, except that hydro is too expensive and charred flesh on the front porch can only bring down the property value. Nope, none of these will do. So instead, I'm sending a form letter to door-to-door solicitors everywhere. So far I've written two, but I can't decide which one will be more effective. What do you think of the following:   OPTION A   Dear Solicitor, I am writing this letter to express my dismay at your appearance on my doorstep this morning. It was an interruption to my daily routine that had an enormous negative impact on the rest of my day. I know that you are only doing your job. Everyone has to put food on the table. But there simply has to be a better way of earning one's keep. To put it another way, you simply can't win with this endeavour. As someone who likes his peace and quiet, I urge you to stop ringing people's doorbells. Time is a valuable resource, and you are surely getting a poor return on your investment. I hope that my feedback will be of some use to you. Unfortunately, you will not be afforded a chance for any sort of rebuttal.   Sincerely, Will   OPTION B  Hey Solicitor, EAT MY SHORTS!!! And if you’re at it lick your Grandma she needs it! Bitterly, A Dissatisfied Non-customer   The voting is now open in the comments section. Stay tuned...  Lalalala! More poetry by yours truly to of course my beautiful boi Fabi!  Sometime I wonder how  People judge our love They never seem to notice that  It is in the form of kisses and hugs Or theat is seems to stem  From some Heaven that is above But if our love is strong  And true and solid to the soul Then listening to them  Is not what we’ll do Our love will be bold The love we have  Will shine through storms No matter how rough the time Forever and ever,  We’ll be together like the sun. Yes, it will shine Yes, we forever shall shine!
