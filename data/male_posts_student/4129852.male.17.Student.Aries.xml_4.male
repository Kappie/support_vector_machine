I'de kill myslef if I could show the world its own beauty. i would bleed myself to show the heart of ppl. I would cry all the rivers full to know ppl can be happy.  i need ppl to see there beauty cause i am an empty vesle I hold nothing in me i am what surrounds me I am a canvas that fades i fade fast so i need to be around happiness or blackness falls on me and is hard to get out.  I wish i could be a white canvas  to show the world what purity is so they may feel the happiness that I would imbody i would gladdly give my life to show this to everyone or even ONE PERSON.  I am nothing waiting to be something  so incurage you all be something so I may be aswell  THANK YOU FOR READING THIS I LOVE ALL OF YOU
