Anyways logged on msn and had a funny conversation with Vix and Sarah (I won't go into detail, was rather erm sexual).  I heard sad news that the only copy of halo has been seriously scratched and so we have no halo to play (unless... nah) but we have plenty of games still t'which is good, i'll need to invest in some food for the party and we have no reliable supplier of beer :'( so i guess we are gonna be sober zat day.  My recent productions have included a new desktop background which i've been editing quite a bit, i've also made a new signature for myself and matching avatar, the new one isn't amazing but its good enough.  Well thats it for this brief and irrelevant post.  Currently listening to :: Music duh (jk i'm listening to New Found Glory) Currently in production :: Little if anything  ~ Atrocity
