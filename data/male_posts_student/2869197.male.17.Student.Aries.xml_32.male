I very briefly spoke with my girlfriend, only long enough to agree that we should eat at House of Chan's sometime tomorrow. Let's hope things get worked out.  But I'm getting ahead of myself. I spoke to her after the Debate meeting today. We talked about Debate, the hardships and glees inherent within. I saw a bunch of newbies there, and that made me happy. Dynasties are being formed as well as new sproutlings. I had to give a minispeech, but that went bad. I mumbled and hum-drummed my way through it then ran to my seat. I still don't have this public speaking thing down pack yet. After the novices left, the returners congregated and we spoke of camp, possible cases, and the Research-a-thon.  As I read my Bible (far more sporadically then I have a right to, I'll admit), I come across a verse in Psalms that says one should "not put any vile thing" before one's eyes. Now, I'm religously curious. While I am secure in my Christianity (as well as my masculinity), I find the urge to study other faiths quite tempting. I believe what I believe to be true, but I still want to know what others believe, why they believe, if there is any truth in their beliefs, etc. It is important to me, but I wonder if this verse is set to hinder me. Would the Koran be a "vile thing"? Has this verse been overided by the fact that we are now an evanglizing sect, and must know the others' views if only to convert them to ours? My, that sounds arrogant. But is it not true? I think society is too freekin' PC these days, that no belief is truly held, just lightly grasped. I promise you I'm not that type of Christian.
