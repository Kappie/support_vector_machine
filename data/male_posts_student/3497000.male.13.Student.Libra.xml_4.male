I was bombarded with a volley of questions and Li Hao was not of any help. Not only did he not know what to say, what he had siad was contradicting the project itself. Sometimes I really feel like killing him. THink of it, he did not do what he was supposed to do and when he did it, it was just slipshot work. Pathetic. Worse of all, I had to work till two in the morning because of him. He went offline on MSN Messenger and still did not disengage his telephone line. Well, my Project's Day is screwed partly thanks to Li Hao. I just hope that MRP would be significantly better.  Au Revoir  Et  God Bless You!
