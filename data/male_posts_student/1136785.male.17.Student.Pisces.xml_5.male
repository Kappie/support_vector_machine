I've been suffering from increasing amounts of anger fits lately - you know those times when you can feel the bile bubble up in the back of your throat, scalding and scarring your vocal cords with pure, unrelenting hatred. Funny thing is though, there's not focus. No one single person, place, or thing other than the musical is really upsetting me. All it is is simply remembering my past failures, and BOOM! I must be really fucking insecure. That sucks. Oh well, made up disorders are better than real ones, I suppose.    I SUPPOSE? What the fuck is that? Thats the problem! INSECURITY my friend. You can't fucking suppose, you got to fucking KNOW. I KNOW this or I KNOW that. You don't fucking suppose things! You need to seize life, and tackle it to the floor, and fucking pistol whip it. And while its down, you need to kick it in the side, flip it over, and piss all over its back. That should teach life a thing or two. You can't fucking do that while you're busy supposing. You got to be knowing! You got to be decisive! You can't even fucking decide where to eat! If someone asks you where to eat, you can be all fucking "I don't care" or "I don't know, what do you want?" You got to be all fucking "We ARE going to Chipotle right now and we are going to fucking like it." You need to apply the fucking willpower to all your hopes and dreams too. What the fuck do you get by dreaming and hoping? Jack fucking squat. You need to go out there and do shit. Don't keep saying you're going to do a fucking independent study or write and article for a voice. You NEED to write that mother-fuckin article right here and now? Are you gonna let Beecher do it instead? I better fucking hope not, you sad sack of shit! So, from now on, I order you to be decisive!   Ok.   WHAT DID YOU SAY?   Yes Sir!   I CAN'T HEAR YOU!   SIR, YES SIR!   Good, now hit the showers and go to bed, cause you may be the craziest goddamned boy I've ever seen.
