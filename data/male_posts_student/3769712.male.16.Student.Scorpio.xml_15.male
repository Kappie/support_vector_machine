I would like to thank god for music.(If you ever win an award, make sure to follow the trend and thank god, everyone does it.) The tely(T.V) isn't that bad, and I have been watching a lot of rugby, working out, and reading(there's not much to do). Oh yeah the Vicious Cycle is everyday life.                                                           P.S.                                                    Live life one day at a time and                                                    hot milk and cookies kick ass.
