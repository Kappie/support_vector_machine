I kind of started a crush on someone but i can't tell anyone who it is because it's a secret:) Well i might as well tell you guys what happened tonight. First off: I came home and talked on msn as usual i talked with Erin and she told he what her blog's URL was so i looked at it and that made me want to make mine!! Second thing: i was talking with Erin and than boom the doorbell rings, "who could it be" I thought to myself. As luck has it, it was my wonderful uncle Kenny who was picking me up to go to lovely work! Unfortunately we were tearing down a garage in pooring rain for 3 hours straight and i feel like crapola. Third thing: I went to blogspot.com and started up my own blog and now i am here saying "saying". See i just said what i said but i didnt.... do you get it? neither do I:S But anywho im gonna publish this beast of a post because its the longest thing i've ever wrote in my life. Wow this is longer than any report i've ever did without any plagerism!!! But yah bye bye yals       *-*Matty*-*  ooo P.S. the reason why i'm calling myself matty on this is because i think girls think its cute!!
