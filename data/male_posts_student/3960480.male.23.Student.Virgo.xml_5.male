So Galileo is at  Jupiter , we've got several bugs over at  Mars  and our good friend the Cassini-Huygens is doing great stuff over there at  Saturn .  So where is MESSENGER going? Well...   Mercury  !   If you have an planner or agenda, then please jot down  next Sunday  (!) for the launch of MESSENGER. It'll get there in 2011.
