It was kind of fun hanging with aren - in fact he hung out here so he didn't have to sleep in the van.  Playing guitars til early morning hours - i really missed that  . ..  but it was awesome, cause we played Wednesday night til about 4 am when the next door neighbors started sending phone calls our way to stop playing.   You know somewhere along life's road i was told that God gives His children "rest".  I wonder if i'm a child of the King because my life is in constant motion, i even wake up tired - but, somehow i make it through another day.  I just can't wait for school to start so i can go back  to one job. I got my information from InterVarsity Christian Fellowship today about this Small Group Leaders Training that i'm going to be doing in August (Lord Willing).  Reading about it has got me stoked - to be an instrument in the hand of the most supreme artist of all - God.  Although, i find that through my tiredness aspects of my personality seem to come out at certaim people - my apathy for one - i hate it when i get so tired that i don't even care - it's such a bad place to be.  I have thought of a new thing - before i go to bed i listen to Classical music, deeply.  And, then throughout the night i have "Christian" music playing at a quiet level and it's amazing the levels of relaxation  that i reach as i sleep.  I must be off for now - to my faithful readers, and others :  May God direct you in the way He wants you to go.  The road is long and narrow - but the end is Glorious
