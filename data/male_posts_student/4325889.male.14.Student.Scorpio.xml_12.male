After both players agree to trade with each other, drag items or zeny from your inventory to the trade window. Also you can View items by right clicking on them. Trade will not be able to succeed as long as you don't press `OK' Button. (Tip: Always check and recheck your trades to make sure that you are getting a fair trade).
