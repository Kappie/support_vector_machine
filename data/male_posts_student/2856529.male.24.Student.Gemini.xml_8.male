The article suggests that the more popular blogs on the internet arenâ€™t necessarily the most original. This is not to say that I am against any of those file-sharing networks, but I guess I can now feel the pain (or is it concern over lost profits) expressed by the media giants over the widespread sharing of relatively new material. There has to be a common ground for the users and the big business so that we can all just get along with each other. Along similar lines of thinking the  urlLink following article  makes sense. Apple has sold its 100 millionth song over the internet suggesting that there might be sound business sense in jumping onto the bandwagon rather than trying to stop it. Maybe cheaper access and better quality might be what the recording industry should look at. Plus tell me if a rapper has a name like 50 Cent is he really worth a million dollar recording contract. Think about it.
