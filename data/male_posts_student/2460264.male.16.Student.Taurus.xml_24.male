And on Saturday night I went over to my good friend, Amy's, house. I've known her all my life, and were really good friends. We jumped on the trampaline a lot. Her friends came over and one of them had a really weird name, Bronwin? haha... but she seemed cool. On Sunday we drove up to camp to see my brothers and for church at chapel point. I met some people and talked to some really old friends. Good stuff. Then Sunday night me and my dad drove home, eight hour drive. Terrible     t     he whole trip kinda made me wish i never moved away.          ~Timmy
