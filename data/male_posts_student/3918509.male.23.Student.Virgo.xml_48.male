They generally follow the pattern of “God disapproves of X, America participates/tolerates/approves of X, therefore God’s wrath is sure to fall upon us.”  Abortion, gay rights and/or marriage, divorce, and immorality in general are favorite topics.  I hear these sorts of comments especially when studying a book like Jeremiah, which is after all full of those kinds of prophecies.  However, now that I’ve recognized the parallels between Jeremiah and Lamentations---parallels that I don’t think are accidental---I’m reconsidering whether the doom-and-gloom predictions by Christians are warranted.  To be sure, God does  disapprove  of homosexuality, divorce, immorality, and the killing of the unborn.  But it’s not logically valid to apply the same lessons from Israelite history to American history, though perhaps the principles still apply.  God made a specific covenant with the Israelites, a large part of which is set out in Leviticus.  He promised them that He would do certain things for them, such as bless them and protect them from their enemies, if they would do certain things for Him, such as keep His commandments.  He further promised that, if they did not, certain consequences would follow, becoming progressively more severe the less they repented.  The prophets are documentation that the promises of Leviticus came true, pretty much exactly as God had promised.  By the end of Jeremiah, only a very small, poor, desperate band of people were left in Canaan, the promised land.  All the rest had been killed or dragged off to Babylon.  By contrast, there is no such covenant between God and America.  It is true that most of the founders of America were Christian, but I’m not sure that fact, in itself, is any more significant than that they were also mostly of British stock.  From both traditions---Christian and British---they drew inspirations for designing their new nation-state.  But there is certainly no covenant relationship between God and Americans, as there was between God and the Israelites.    In my opinion, that means that the usual doom-and-gloom predictions by Christians are a bit off base.  It may well be that approval of homosexuality is a bad thing for this country, or any other country, and that approval will lead to bad consequences.  But we Christians must be careful and judicious in our use of the scripture, and not make it fit where it doesn’t fit.  There are plenty of reasons to oppose homosexuality, divorce, immorality, and the killing of the unborn, but claiming that God’s judgment will fall on us as it did the ancient Israelites is putting words in God’s mouth.
