First there was a photographer that kept taking shots of 2 girls on a lion statue for over 2 hours, then we went inside the mall and somewhere in the end of our "trip" in the mall a group of people, prolly 3 couples, 2 moms and 2 dads + there new wedded (or not) kids, the woman was pregnant, then for no reason one of the mothers came by to my sister (did i forget to mention i am sleeping over the summer @ my sister's? :P) who's 9th month pregnat and start chatting about her belly with her, then the pregnat woman comes and the mother wanted to compare who had a bigger belly, OH COME ON! - buh but that was yesterday :/  Today I went to a public sale in Tel-Aviv, no reason just to see what's there; after looking I sat down with my sister to hear what they were offering, somewhere about 10 minutes of sitting my nephew heard that the man said he was offering a DVD with an opening price of 1 NIS (about 25Â¢) so my nephew shouted "1 NIS"! and that old hag had the rudeness of insulting my nephew and said he'll slap him >:/.  After that we went to the beach in Tel-Aviv just to walk abit but my sister had a fight with her husbad in the car, for no reason :/. When we were walking on the beach my nephew started running forward and then stopping sharply and I told him not to and my sister, which is looking for a reason to have a fight with me and everybody else startes shouting at me and got angry at me too.  I hope everything will be better tommrow and for the next two weeks while I am here.
