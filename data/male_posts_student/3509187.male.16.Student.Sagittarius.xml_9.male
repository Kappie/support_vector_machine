I'll be camping again tonight so don't expect anything new until later tomorrow.  The delay has also been partly due to my computer being infected by horribly crap... but... Thanks to Mr Ebersole Sn. my computer seems to be back in normal working order.    I don't really have much to say cept nothing much has happened and I'm hoping to hear something about Napoleon Dynamite soon.  Monday was my last day of In-Car.  I drove the Focus cause I really like it.  I also used some of my time yesterday looking them up online.  I've decided I like the 3-Door Hatch Back.  The 2003 is a nice model.  New they run around $15000 and a used 2003 would be about $10000... not to bad for a nice car. Yesterday was my first day of On-Road.  I drove the new Malibu.  Its interesting.  We did emergency stops and stalls. I have On-Road again today and Friday.  Thats about all there is, cept I'm going to be posting 2 really funny pictures from Mad mag.  They are a spoof of the IPod ads.  Until I reture and write again...  -Dan V
