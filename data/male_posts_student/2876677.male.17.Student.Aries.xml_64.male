I usually don't go to bed until 2 and am still wide awake when I go to bed but last night for some reason I was wicked tired and couldn't concentrate on reading.  So I crashed...and today I suffer for it.  I did manage to get a lot of good books on the effects of nuclear radiation.  ...I skimmed one.  Whopops.  What can ya do?  Well I should go.  Last night was fun even though I didn't do what I was supposed to.  Actually, it was probably fun  because  I didn't do what I was supposed to.  PacSun was fun...to say the least.  What a good time...and a memory to tell my kids.  I hope my kids won't do wierd things for money.
