 English was fun because  The Importance of Being Ernest  is a  really   funny play and I'm reading the part of a character who talks a lot. I think it is hilarious how every, single character is a complete and utter moron; they remind me of many people I know. LOL 
 Government was cool because Robin, Whitney, Lauren, and I left to talk with Mrs. Stewart and Mrs. Shaw about different things. We got Mrs. Stewart to  use Class money to buy a flower arrangement for Ms. Conn. We talked to Mrs. Shaw about class officer stuff and then Mrs. Norris about the future student council. I'm still pissed that class officers are ineligible to run. Although we were out of class for the entire period, the bad thing was that we got stuck in Mrs. Norris' office because of her mouth. Her voice is so smooth and soothing that it could put even an insomniac to sleep. Robin, Lauren, and I left Whitney behind because Mrs. Norris wanted to talk to her. After about fifteen minutes we realized that Whitney probably needed a "rescue." I told the sub "we just realized that we left our fourth member behind and she's with someone who talks a whole lot. Can I go rescue her?" The sub said yes. Ha, ha, ha! I went down to guidance and told Whitney and Mrs. Norris that the sub needed Whitney to come to class and finish her assignment. Once we got away, I told Whitney the truth and she thanked me. Ha! Ha! 
 Some funny quotes from Calculus:  Richard thought Zach said he didn't understand the Calculus. Richard screamed out, "Ha, I feel smart. Take that, bitch." I started laughing but Zach, looking flustered, went off on Richard about "Are you in the top 10? No, there are only 5 in it." Zach was really going off but he didn't make sense for a while until he said that he meant 10%. 
 After Mr. Aihie had to correct my test grade (BECAUSE TRAVIS BLAZED ME) from a 90% to an 85% (I missed three problems worth five points a piece), Alex said "He's a college calculus teacher but he can't count." Mr. Aihie didn't find it amusing. 
 Also in Calculus, Mr. Aihie tried to tell us that if the problem is worded "where x is at 1" means "as x approaches 1" which is completely different. "X is at 1" means x = 1. "As x approaches 1" means that x includes numbers that lead up to, but do not include, x. It is a huge difference, trust me, ask any Calculus student or math teacher. He told us that "a sentence in Calculus is not a sentence. Math is just understanding a different language." That's why I hate Calculus, it's math and Mr. Aihie doesn't admit when he's wrong, even if it's obvious.
