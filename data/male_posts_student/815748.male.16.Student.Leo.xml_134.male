Today's trial was fun, especially because, since I didn't take notes, I was free to enjoy the trial.  There weren't really any funny quotes, though Professor Chervy once said "I had nothing to do," on cross, that sounded strange.  Again, Palmer (Jake) had the best line in the trial.  He was being crossed on whether Sarak's intended marketing could have saved her CD, and was being asked if he even knew what it was, and Palmer said, "Well, if it were anything like her earlier marketing, it must not have been very good."  Ahhh, inside jokes.  Suck on that, non-MTers.
