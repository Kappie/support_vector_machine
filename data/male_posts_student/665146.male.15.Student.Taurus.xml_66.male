On a separate note, and since the word oyrech may have disturbed you to some extent, I shall tell you an old Yiddish fable/joke.  Before I continue with this, I'll cover the essentials.  oyrech: guest shtetl: little town Shabbes: Sabbath  Mr. Ostrovsky, a traveling salesman, found himself in the synagogue in a little shtetl in Galica one Friday night.  After the prayers, as the Jews turned right, turned left, in the traditional manner, smiling, shaking hands, uttering the "Gut Shabbes" greeting, Mr. Ostrovsky, sighing and melancholy, set off in search of a place to sleep. "Where are you going?" exclaimed a man.  "A Jew, alone, on Shabbes?  Come, man.  Come home with me!  have dinner in my house, spend the night with us.  No, no; no excuses!  My name is Glantz.  Come along.  My wife is a marvelous cook, and you'll have a dinner you'll never forget!" Off went the grateful Ostrovsky with his exuberant host. Mr. Glantz's promises were not empty:  No host and hostess could have been warmer, kinder, more considerate.  Ostrovsky was given a fine bedroom, urged to soak in a hot tub, given fluffy towels and scented soap--and fed a superlative dinner.  He slept, that night, between fine linen sheets, and next morning ate a sumptuous breakfast. As he made his heart felt farewells to his host, Ostrovsky said, "How can I ever thank you?" Said his host, "Just attent to this." And Glantz handed Ostrovsky a piece of paper.  The incredulous Ostrovsky read:  1 bath hot water.......................10 kopecks 1 cake scented soap................20 kopecks 1 large towel............................10 kopecks 1 sabbath dinner (complete)..... 2.50 rubles 2 fresh sheets..........................20 kopecks 1 fresh pillow case....................10 kopecks 1 breakfast...............................75 kopecks                     TOTAL 3.95 rubles  "But--what's this?" asked Ostrovsky. "Your bill," said Glantz "You expect me to  pay  this?!" "Certainly," said Glantz.  "Are you denying that you bathed here, slept here, ate like a king---" "Deny it?  I'm flabbergasted!" exclaimed Ostrovsky.  "You  invited  me here!  You  asked  me to be your Shabbes oyrech!  I've never heard a more outrageous---" "Stop!" Glantz held up his hand peremptorily.  Let's not argue, my friend.  Will you agree to come to our rabbi and tell him everything, and abide by his decision?" "Will I?" cried Ostrovsky.  "I can't  wait  to hear what the rabbi tells you about such disgusting behavior!"  Off went the two men to the rabbi, who, seeing their expressions, said, "Well, my friends, what happened so to spoil your Sabbath?" Ostrovsky told his tale to the rabbi, pouring out the words with fervor. The rabbi turned to Glantz.  "And what do you, the host, have to say?" "Nothing," said Glantz.  "Everything he said is accurate, just as it happened." "There you are rabbi!" cried Ostrovsky.  "You see?" The rabbi nodded.  "After hearing you both, and considering all the delicate ethical problems involved, and based on the wisdom--on just such problems--I have studied for years in the Talmud, my decision is clear: Ostrovsky, pay the bill."  With a heavy heart, Ostrovsky sighed, "Very well." Ostrovsky and his host left the rabbi's house, and Ostrovsky started to count out money. "What are you doing?" asked Glantz. "Paying your bill," said Ostrovsky. "Paying me?  For my hospitality?  You must be crazy.  Do you think I would accept money from you, my honored guest, my oyrech auf Shabbes?" Ostrovsky sputtered:  "You gave me the bill!!  You asked for money!!!  YOU made me come here!  You---" "Oh, that," scoffed Glantz.  "I just wanted you to see what a dope we have here for a rabbi."
