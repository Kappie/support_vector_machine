I hate it. It is awful. If I had to pick between Gym Class or death, I would probably pick death, because unlike Gym, Death is quiet, peaceful and probably doesn't smell like a great big armpit. There are several things I hate about Gym, and four of them are teachers. There are six teachers teaching Gym Class. It takes them the better part of an hour to take attendence. When we transition from one place to another almost none of the students know what's going on because none of the teachers know what's going on and that is because there are six of them. There's Mr. Holman, Mrs. Annee, Mrs. Fuson, and three LN teachers I don't know. One of them looks like Mr. Harvey with dark hair and a buzzcut, the others look old. And the teachers don't like each other. One of the old LN teachers told me to take my Tardy Pass to "Mrs. Hag" née Mrs. Fuson. Mr. Holman refered to her as the Gestapo. And both of them were right, because Fuson is what you would get if Aileen Wuornos and Joan Collins had a baby together. She's bitchy, she's ill-tempered, she's always yelling about something and I'm pretty sure she was hungover this morning. We did swim testing yesterday, and we swam about eight different times because the teachers were incompetant. Then we went and ran on the track and played optional Basketball. So I dribbled for about ten minutes and sat on the bleachers until we got dressed. I've just been wearing my gym clothes to school because of three things: number one, I always have it with me, Number two, I'm not getting dressed up for these people and number three, I'm inevitably going to get sweaty and I will pick the shower in my house over the shower at school everytime, so I'm not going to get new clothes all icky and sweaty. Of course, everyday people have asked me questions like "Why are you wearing your gym suit? We just changed." From now on, I'm answering "None of your damn business." Just because I can. One kid who is one of those kids who thinks he's cool, but is just a ass, made a snide comment, which I just ignored because he's ugly, fat, gay and a general asshole. To sum it up: Gym = Bad.  Okay, on to lighter subjects, I'm having "LotRCon II: Forth Eorlingas!" at my house on Friday at 4:30. So far I have Jonah, Nathan and Claire coming. More are welcome. RSVP in the comments section.  "Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?" "No, it's my cookie."
