She stated that she doesn't spend money on people who get C's. I burst into tears...she asks me what's wrong, as if she can't guess. I explain everything, and she  tries  to comfort me, but her dissapointed tone doesn't calm my unstable emotions. She sighs and tells me she won't cancel my trips. I try to smile, it doesn't work. I try to explain to her how much pressure I feel is on me, after bein g pushed to do so many activities...and I don't do drugs or get in trouble and I'm usually nice and polite...and yet I still find after one mistake I'm not good enough for her....she scolds me trying to make her feel guilty.   It's all my fault. I should have checked my grade with the teacher more often. It's just.....my new teacher (my previous science teacher moved away to be with her husband...I loved her.) is just so cold. If we ask him for help he laughs at us. He gives us vague assignments (e.g.: once he said "Record the weather forcast for 5 days and give me the results." that's all. We all did it, and afterwards he yelled at us for not following requirements. Apparently we didn't catch the part about wind speed, direction, dew point, sunrise/set, and humidity.), he never gives us progress reports, he writes an assignment in small letters on a corner of the whiteboard (there are notes up there from other classes, too) and never says anything about them, there are no due dates, and he sets the amount of points for an assignment depending on how many people do it. I place a little blame on him, I guess. I just never felt comfortable when I can't figure out a formula or a problem. The thing that gets me the most is the lack of due dates...I need structure.  After crying in my room for an hour or so, my father comes down and reminds me of how he doesn't love me because of my grades, but because I'm a good person and I try really hard. That uberly made me feel better....for a moment I almost forgot how much of a huge deal the whole thing was.   And now for something completely different. Some people can take a little thing that was never going to work out anyway and make a huge issue out of it. I love them, however. They just need to forget about it and move onto something new. It was a good first try.
