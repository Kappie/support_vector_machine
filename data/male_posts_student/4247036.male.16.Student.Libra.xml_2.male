I was betrayed by one of *her* friends...stole my cupcake, its totally on now...straight street...straight hood.  Anyway, today was pretty fun in school.  Practice was hell, hot and tiring, not to mention I had a TON of stuff to do and still do.  I'm getting my assignment from Cyndi...how great she is =]  I'm tired but I'll be up late, maybe even late enough to post again.  Untill next time...
