Personally, I think if it really was written to describe how he really feels, that would be kind of weird. When I read it, I seem to think more of the pressures of society of doing things that are "cool." At the end though, it stops to make any sense at all to me.  Also, as Mattson said, Ronald died. One less ex-president to populate the earth. Everyone can celebrate.   Dear Mr. Houle, We here at the Dairison, as it is called, think that you should come work with us. Leave Culver's behind and come join us. Not only is the working enviroment much better, but you will get paid much more. The end.
