I must EXCORCISE IT BE gone once and for all.I must believe that i can do it. anywayz on Sat i went to the hope of god church at the invitation of Freedy, one of Jansen's friend to have lunch and then attend praise and worship. It was fun alrite, with some clips of american idol uncensored, all the bloopers etc..( william hung.. hehe) What the pastor said was truly meaning, if one doesnt have any weaknesses, that person will be too proud. So weaknesses keep us humble. Anyway after service, i went to taka library to study for a while before heading home.  On sunday, went for service at city harvest church, met Amos at the entrance who showed me the way.Once again, found the service meaningful and amazed at the energy exhibited by the ppl. Saw Ho Yeow Sun, a singer who was also the pastor at that church. THere were a lot of pastors present, including the guest from malaysia and Russia.  After service, rushed back to town to meet parents for Father's day meal. Journey took ages once again, more than an hour. AFter that accompanied my dad to search for a new hp for his present.However, his plan not yet 21 months, so have to wait for another month. Phones super ex, even with trade ins...  Yup after that, went back home, took a nap, studied a bit and then slacked..
