OK because I Have horrible memory Im going to go through all the things worth mentioning that has happened in the past few weeks, ENJOY!!!            Ummmmm, where to start, On Tuesday (yesterday) I went to play laser tag with some friends and it was awesome, cept for the fact that i didnt come in first at all. ;p See, the thing is that the last time we went to laser tag I scored like 1,000 points in one game and got like the record of the month (I have the score card taped on my wall for all you non-believers), and this time my high score was like 762 or something, IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!  During the game there was some annoying people that should have been shanked (Kat wouldnt let me, so I shanked her) and made the game slightly less fun.  There was this little mehican boy/girl that kept following me and pulling on my gun, me being smart and having some pent up rage, I followed it and scared the little shemale right out of its punky little socks.  Score one for those people who dont like kids!!!! WOOHOO.  Ummm, on the way home, my friend nathan had his little apple-head chuaua doggie, named Poco in the car and seeing as how i love little kitties I set down my soda and scooped up the little ball of joy.  See, untill Kat said something about the whereabouts of my soda I was happy, content, and in perfect bliss, but then after she said, "Yo sup wheres ya soda pap", (paraphrased) I didnt quite know exactly and then i felt some wetness on my legs and for some reason hoped it was the dog and not my soda (i dont know either).  It was the soda.  I passed the dog off to Nathan and he's like, "Why is the dog sticky?" I pretended not to hear him, hehehehhehee SUCKER!!!
