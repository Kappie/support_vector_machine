Or is it his sad tale?     I was situated at the corner of Temple City and Lemon, strutting south toward the little green man without a face.   urlLink John  was with me, and we'd just come from summer school.    "KEVIN HUYNH!"    I looked to my right and saw Andrew's head peeking out of his car, smiling.  He always does that, I thought.  I grinned widely for no apparent reason.  Then my heart nearly skipped a beat, or maybe it did, how can you tell?: A larger than normal sized truck came skidding past, which sprayed water from the puddle that was not there, made from the rain that didn't exist.    When the truck finally past by, the only thing on the road was Andrew's head.  It was rolling on the floor with that same happy expression, it was still smiling.  It would  have been less horrible without the crimson red blood dripping from his "decapitated" head, unfortunately, the blood was there, and at the next moment I was at his furneral.      Strange, the casket was open, and Andrew's body was in a suit.  He was wearing a silky black jacket with a nice white dress shirt.  His head was still missing, and even more strange, his neck was bare; no bandages.     (The picture above was taken from Eric's  urlLink blog .  He doesn't know yet, so don't tell him!)   I arrived home and headed for my room.  When I opened the door, I recieved the shock of my subconscious life.  There, right on my bed, lay a fish bowl with Andrew's head in it.    Still f-ing smiling.     In an attempt to save my dignity, I will say that anything Andrew does ends up, in one way or another, making me laugh.  So it's no surprise that when I woke up from the dream, I was not screaming in horror, but laughing hysterically.    But you must think, Why, Kevin is a mad man!    Indeed, I am.  Maybe even, a morbid mad man.  Is that an alliteration?  Kevin, the alliterating morbid mad man.    Okay, anyway, that's enough fame for Andrew.  Don't want to spoil his mind; the whole world will know his name.  He's far better off away from those things.  There, there, Ben, after all, it's not really good bye.  He'll be at Hogwarts soon enough.  Good bye, Harry Potter--the boy who lived!
