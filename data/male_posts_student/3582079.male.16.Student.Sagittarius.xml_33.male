It's getting late into the day. I don't feel like I've accomplished anything. But I seem to begetting by, paying my dues. Making my way with justenough money to drink at this bar. Mylife isn't too colorful... but that's ok, becausewhiskey makes up for it... right?  A remember her voice... she always told me to be strong... but I'm doing alright... aren't I?  I'm... getting by... just me... and my whiskey...
