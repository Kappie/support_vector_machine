Asking Gargoyles some wierd questions, kissing a werewolf, being murdered, discovering I am a werewolf and am not dead...and then having to save the city from some hideous evil....crazy.  I had the sudden idea to play the original Lands Of Lore...was wanting to try it and see if it would run on windows XP...wasn't easy..several sites said it is simple and runs without problems...Why is it always me who finds problems? After messing around with memory, compatability settings and DOS emulators I ended up giving up..  Got back to it later on...and played around with the memory settings, eventually I got it working by increasing the XMS memory....darn thing...well...I guess at least it works now, and runs quite well. Now gotta get the Virtual CD drive and the actual CD drive swapped round so it will detect the virtual drive with the CD image of lands of lore so I don't need the CD in...hehe...  In other news...I didn't win the Halfquake contest I had entered, but apparently I get a Halfquake Fan CD anyway...and a small surprise...I cant wait..lol Also...preparing for the Excelsior is interesting...need to get myself some soft-woled shoes or plimsols or somethign to wear on deck....can't be wearing my boots on there. Need to go and grab some cheap ones...since i won't be wearing them often after the trip. Also need to get a few more items for the trip as well...at least I don't have to worry too much about camera now...I'll be using a different camera with a 64MB card in it.
