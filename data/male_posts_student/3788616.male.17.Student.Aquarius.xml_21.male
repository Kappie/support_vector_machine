GRR!!! reading, had stumbles... conversation had pauses which i knew i could have done without but darn nervousness simply killed me there... damn it... oh well... that's gone anyway...  Another thing that's pissing me off in school? can you guess? it's actually the animosity between Michelle Lim and me lah... i mean... it's not like i offended her or anything loh... but than... i don't like the look she gives me... wah lau... if not for the fact that i treat her as a friend ah, and the fact that she's a girl, not to mention that i am the class rep... i don't know lah... i wouldn't be so composed... or... of course, perhaps i am simply being paranoid... i don't know... but... in reality, i wish that if anyone has a problem with me, just simply bring it up to me... i hate it when people are being hypocrites... damn it! yup... that's what all that i want to whine about right now... except...  MY BACK!!! it's certainly getting better... but... heck, i really wish that it was completely healed already! Anyway, it doesn't matter, i think i am still going to go for basketball training tomorrow. I simply can't afford to miss trainings again. Haha... okok... but... if i really cannot   tahan   tomorrow, i'll just stop and tell the coach. Yup... but... i am of course crossing my fingers and praying that i would be fine lah!  hmm... what else is there to update? i don't think there is much liao. Except that i have not been doing my stupid holiday homework so they have all come back to haunt me! ARGH!!! haha... nevertheless, i must remain upbeat... and... continue... Living Life To The Fullest! :p
