["I Wish It Would Rain Down," Phil Collins, 1989]  If I write with less frequency over the next week, that's why.  I did take a little time out to talk with some non-med student friends. Ashley Colburn is now all moved in at Temple in Philadelphia ready to start the physical therapy program. Laurie Glenn, err.....Laurie Biffer and I have now known each other for 15 years (since 2nd grade). We spent a while reminiscing about the good ol' days at Krum. The crowd that we both ran around with is now sooo dispersed that I'm not sure if we'll ever be toghether in one place again. ["I'll Be Around," Joan Osborne, 2002]  "The Big Chill" is a really good movie about a circle of old friends, for years seperated, that find each other again after the death of one of the friends. I hope to find a lot of these people again, especially since my 5 year HS reunion is something like 9 months away. [ "Vasoline," Stone Temple Pilots, 1994]    One of my newer friends here in Fort Worth, AnnMarie, was in a few of my public health classes this summer. We get along really well, for she is a former paramedic and we like to swap EMS stories. Well, over the summer her father died and that was a big burden for her. Long story short, I found out that her mother died just a few weeks ago, so in a period of 2 months she has lost both of her parents. I can't even imagine what she's going through; that's really scarey. ["City of New Orleans," Arlo Guthrie]  Since I've come back home I can tell that my relationship with my folks is much improved. Prior to Duke is was very strained, but now it's wonderful. I can't, and don't want to, imagine losing them at my age. If I were a religious person I would be praying for AnnMarie, but I'll be thinking about her while she takes the semester off.   Recommended song: "Pets" , Porno for Pyros, 1993.
