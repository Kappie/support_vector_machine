Well, Yesturday I whent over Theo's house and we played Pokemon. That was fun. Then Chris woke up and we played winback...That too was fun.  When I got home Steve wanted me to stay the night so I did. (My foot is killing me still)  I also found out that on the 25 I might be going to Busch Gardens again... yay!  Then Last night around midnight we watched Kill Bill Vol. 2.  It was really good but I think Vol.1 is better.  not because it was more bloody...but because it seemes more interesting to me. Vol 2 though did have alot more dialouge that I could  not really hear casue we had to have the TV turned down really low. I also watched the movie Min in Black 2...It was better than I expected...  Then around 3 I came home and whent right to my room cause, me and my parents are changing rooms.  At 6:30 I had a doctors appointment. I think it whent well...But afterwards I seemed a bit depressed for some reason...the thing that piss' me off most though is the fact that I had just finished venting...some.  We then went to dinner at Rancho Grande...after wards I felt sick and still feel a bit sick in the stomach!  And now I am online just talking to Rhae...I really hope I can see her this weekend. That would make me so happy!  I haven't felt happy in a long time. Sure I "act happy" but I'm not really. It is kinda sad.  Also I can't wait for school to start because I miss people.  Concerning I cant drive, I seem to not be able to go or see people that I want to. Only way I can seem to see people is if they drive, and that makes me feel a little bad because there are a load of people I can't see. (I need my lisence...but I keep failing  or people wont take me!)  I have also been venting in my journal alot more. but I want to know why lately, after I finish venting in my notebook or to other people...why do I still feel depressed.  The Doctor had asked me to define my depression. I told him "It is where I have no real emotion. I am not happy, sad, angery, anything. I am in the middle of it all. So I mood swing." he then told me I seem more pesamistic than optimistic. That is not good. He then asked me what I can do to help myself be alittle more happier. I told him the same thing I tell him everytime he asks that question...  Random ranting...  If "verb is what you do" is there an anti-verb for the lazy people?  If she wrote the murder...Why dosn't she change what happens in the story?   It isn't the size of the mushroom...it's how it's eaten.  If we are the smartest animal on the planet...then how come we are  are the only animals that rage war?   Do other animals try to take over the world?  Are we the only animals driven by sex?  WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE FEELINGS!?  Why do we have a desire to be accepted?  Why do we long for compnionship?  Is there a such thing as "Love"?  Is love all you need?  Why are people the acception to the "it is the cycle of nature for animals to kill other animals." rule?  Why do people actually for Best Friend realationships with other people.  WHY DO I ALWAYS GET THROWN IN THE MIDLLE OF EVERYTHING!?  Has being different become a fad?  Why is pink the new black?  Is being normal different?  Are we so insecure with ourselves that we will change our personal apperance, or follow the crowd just for acceptance?  Dose this appear in anyother culture, or animal society?  well I think that is all for now.     *sigh*
