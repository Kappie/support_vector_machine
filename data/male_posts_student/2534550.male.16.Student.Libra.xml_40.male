SO get to changin, and I'll transfer our stuff before the weeks out.     ----   On another note, I just have to thank everyone for an incredible Memorial Weekend camp. I was so blown away by our ability to get down and dirty, to focus, to just intesify our rehearsal, maxing it out to it's greatest potential.  Yeah, cheesy, and it's been said before, but really...   like I said to....umm....a lot of people.... how the hornline was running their own stuff while the the DL and guard worked with Ken? :-D Good stuff, homes.   Shawn told us to "yip," to talk it up, hype it up.... Folks, we don't really have to! I've read two unprovoked (meaning I didn't tell em to write it at all) reviews of our weekened, by alums and people in the activity. They see where we're goin, probably better than we do, since they can see it from the judges standpoint.    urlLink Here's one  and  urlLink here's another.  If I'm maxing this season out for anyone, it's for those alums, those who marched BDB in the past, those who believe we've got something special. :)
