Church the next morning, because, I was, as always, forced to go. Grrreat. I sat in the back and one point argued with him, sort of, cause i asked him..lemme think..Oh yeah! He said that God was in Jesus, so thats why he was special. But then i asked, the bible says everyone has the spirit in them. so arent we all God? Then he went into this big thing about how the erath started that really did not relate. he summmed it up at the end somehow saying i was wrong. whatever.  i stuidied a lot...at 2 i went to brightons house....at 5 i came back and studied....then watched 60 minutes while i ate since my dad was watching it. it was funny, even though a lot of it shouldnt have been. then i dis work, talked to aisha, and went to watch aamerican dreams. it was an ok episode, but the one next week looks really good, meg calls her mom a tramp after her mom gets mad at her for going swimming with all these people and making out with drew. mhm.   today....nothing exciting. but im gonna have to study like hell tonight. staying til 4 here for bio, going home, leaving at 6 30ish for grandmas(who used to be bio teacher).  hm. this morning during PE/free, rina airhumped me. it wa sinteresting.
