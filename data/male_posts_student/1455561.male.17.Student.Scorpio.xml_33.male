Cant get the comment things to work so i'll give you an email adress shortly which you can send to.  No one will, no one reads this but just in case.  And dont send me crap cos it will just be a yahoo account and i will delete it and then bury my computer deep underground where your electronic space signals cant hurt it. my precious.  Thinking about getting a proper web page that i can design properly and put some interesting stuff on apart from this torrent of drivel about mathematical clapping.  Reading from the unspeakable "well awarded by the guardian newspaper" ones blog i see he is going to new york now.  with his mates.    .......just....... *sigh*....... ....    . . . Ignore him.  Everyone, please abandon his blog for a week to teach him not to be such a lucky little bastard.  I think its great that he has such a good time, just dont write down how good a time it is and get people to read it and award you for having more interesting things to write than them.  Just dont go there any more, ever.  Thats how the revolution will start. maybe.  if there is one.  I dont really want one or anything, i'm just saying that ignoring people might start it.  heres a link to it so you can all appreciate him.   urlLink matt munton
