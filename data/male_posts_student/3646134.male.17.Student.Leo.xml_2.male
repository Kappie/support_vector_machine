I thought my flu was going away but I appear to have had a relapse.  Arses.  And because of the antibiotics, I can't take my bloody painkillers!  (I did my back in saving someone's knees a fair while ago... long story!) but it needs an operation... and till then I get some loverly painkillers that stop the bugger hurting.  Buuut im not allowed with these antibiotics or bad things could happen :(.  The doctor gave me different ones... I took one last night, it made my vision go purple and me go insanely hyper and happy :| so I decided I'd stay off them for the sake of my sanity!  Now I have a lovely mix of flu, hayfever and a knackered back!  Woohoo :|  I've been advised what to do with the Katie thing... a load of people were arsing round the subject... the only person who gave me plain advice was Rachel: "Block her".  So I took it lol.  Thankyou darling :) was the rite choice, I just needed it slapped into me :p  Caroline is starting to have a massive spaz-fit on me.  I aint been to electronics in weeks.  hehe.  I better start going, she's developing a glint in her eye like next time the class goes in, they're gonna find me nailed above her door by my testicles.  Went to town with Jonsey today.  The backtwat incident was braught back up so we spent a good 10 mins laughing, and we had a general bitch about everyone we dont like :p haha.  So all in all... a good day with a damn bad illness :|
