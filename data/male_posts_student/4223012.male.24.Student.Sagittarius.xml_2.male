Before I type anymore I would like to observe a minute of silence to my very very good friend, Justice's wife Nana Ama. 1980-2004.  .........30........20..........10..9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1  She died after a very short illness (2 hours) at the Ealing Hospital, London on Sunday 08/08/2004. She left behind her husband Justice and their lovely two year old daughter, Juanita (pronounced " huanita"). Her death is left a very big gap in our hearts. We were like family. I rolled with Justice and his twin brother, Julius, and our wives also did their own thing. We would have dinner together on Friday nites. We used to have our Friday nite dinner at my place but lately we've been having it at Justice's. Now that his wife is gone, Friday nite for us will never be the same. I PRAY TO GOD HER SOUL TO KEEP.  I know this is not the best way to start my blogs but I had to do this. I'll tell you more about myself and what's going on in my head (you wish). Hey! I've got a good deal on a gym membership so I'm going back to exercise after a year and half. I moved from a 34 inch waist to almost 38 in 18 months, even though I only have two meals a day instead of three. But the two are heavy enough to knock Mike Tyson off. Anyway, I heading back to the gym, no turning back.
