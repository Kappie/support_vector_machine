The bus trip was kind hard...Being 19 hours on a bus with both your friends and the people that after 5 hours you wish to smother in their sleep >:-) .  Not that I did or anything....In other news Bobby Liu died mysteriously on the bus around 2 am...... heh heh heh......( I'm just kidding!) it's fun...I almost got a picture of me looking really really stupid on the Tower of Terror but I decided that it was too expensive and I would prefer the world did not see how I looked on that ride. Well my time on the net is almost up (15 minute max) so byebye might post more later
