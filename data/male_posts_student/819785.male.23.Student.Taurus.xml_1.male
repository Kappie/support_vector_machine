It's looking pretty good so far, figure I really need some sort of script to manage the photo gallery though, but I don't have the knowledge or ability to write one yet - or the facility, since my webspace doesn't allow CGI scripts. Thankfully I'm going to be learning Perl in one of my uni modules, so I'll doubtless pick up the skills there. Might be able to claim for any work I do on the site too :)  Today's quite an easy day, no uni. Still got to go to work though, and I'm really really looking forward to that :P Ah well, that's life, as I so often tell myself. Suppose I should really get on with scanning the other photos in a minute, but it isn't even 9am yet so I can't be bothered!
