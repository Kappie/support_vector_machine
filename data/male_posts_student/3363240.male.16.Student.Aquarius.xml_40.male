       
      (this is how I remember it) I asked earlier today if Kaya wanted to see me tomorrow, and she said, "sure, but I'm busy in the morning and afternoon" And I asked her again tonight if she wanted to, and the response was "I can't." So..I came to the conclusion that, because I'm an assmonger, I am not gonna be on good terms with her....which is entirely my fault...and I have no way to change it.....because I am (see one line up,) an assmonger. See ya'll when you actually want to see me ~Asshole guy whose name doesn't matter anymore.
