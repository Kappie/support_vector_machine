So I was sitting in my living room after work (I mean) and I hear this large thing coming down the street. now the only reason this is so unusual is because it was at 11:30 at night. So it turns out it was an ambulance. Great. So the pulled up almost right across the street from me to an elderly couples house (89+) and I figure, "alright, maybe they just fell, they do that alot" so I watch and then they pull out that stretcher thingamajig "shit" goes gideons mind. so they took one of em away, and while the ambulance was there the other was just staning in the doorway...watching. I felt so bad for em, I donno, just kinda sad watching your loved one getting loaded and taken away in an ambulance.  Right, hows that for a happy post? G
