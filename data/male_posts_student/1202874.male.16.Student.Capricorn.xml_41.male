(see you can tell that its a bedford student)  i'm taking full advantage of the extra time but suprisingly not to catch up on studies. this weekend has been cool so far. nothing to complain about thats for sure. so thursday afterschool my buddy mitch and i meet up to see what the plans for the night are gonna be. by some random act of god angie, roz, and nick end up comign with us to target. these children much welcomed, especially the ones with boobs. (that means roz. lol maybe angie depends if i have my glasses on) anyways back to the story. after that angie and roz have their last jv volleyball game around 6 so we head back up to the high school. me and mitch schooled angie and roz at some "extreme" badmiton. and then we felt the burn in the weight room. for a skinny dude mitch has some strong legs. then the freshmen game started. i think in both of the games we scored about 6 points combined. and you're think don't you need 15 to win just one game? yea you are right. then the jv game was  slightly  better. angie and roz got distracted by our cheering but hey we're just trying to support the team. well we lost interest in the white ball going back and forth so we left. after that we walked around town and ended up watching identity with christine and john. then i had to leave. not incredibly exciting but it happens.    and then friday came. (i know this is getting long but this is probably the only time i'll get to write this weekend so i wanna cover most of it) i woke up around 12:30 which is always good. then i get a call from the hulk, otherwise known as mitch. mitch and his sister were heading up to the mall and her thunderbird has 4 seats so i'm invited. amy hurst ends up with us too. the more the merrier.  of course i left my wallet in my other pair of pants when i changed... pure genius. oh well it kept me from spending my money. after that we have to go to the bank before dinner. as we make a left on what we thought was a 1 lane road we get our tail light taken off by a mini-van. fa riggin abulous. well turns out it was a 2 lane road and amber's mom was not a happy person. but finally we got our starving asses to bob evans. it was pretty funny cause i'm decently good at making people nervous when i stare. amber cussed me out a couple times and then amy threatened not to pay for me. it didn't really stop me but she was nice and payed. after that we went to cyber pete's and then to christines with tom. that was a lot of fun but then us 3 guys came to my house.  man that was hilarious. we beat the crap out of tom. he kept talking about how he had to get up the next morning but we didn't care. let's see..... we flashed a strobe light in his eyes til he got a headache, then i sat on top of him and repeatedly punched him in the ribs, hit him with the butt end of a golf club, slapped him in the head to make him respond to us with "sir", and the classic shaving cream technique. he got it pretty bad but he was complaining. it all evened out. we finally left him to sleep in the living room at about 5:30. mitch and i were crying in laughter most of the time. tom was just crying. the next day at breakfast i was telling my mom the story and she was cracking up pretty good so you know it was funny. they left sometime in the afternoon and i caught up on some sleep.   anywho that was all the exciting, funny, and/or weird things that happened so far this weekend and this is by far the longest entry  EVER . to those that finished, you're diploma will be in the mail. i'm calling it and night. stay safe.
