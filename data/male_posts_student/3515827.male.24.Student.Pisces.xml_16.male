In her new book,  urlLink  In Defense of Internment:  Why all foreigners are filthy dogs  The Case for "Racial Profiling",   she outlines why putting the Japanese in camps during WWII was necessary (I haven't read the book, but I bet it has to do something with Pearl Harbor and them being our enemy or something, but that's just a guess).  Here are some highlights:     What the West Coast relocation centers were really like: tens of thousands of ethnic Japanese were allowed to leave; hundreds voluntarily chose to move in -- and many residents even protested their closing!  You see, they could have left anytime they wanted, is not like there was a  urlLink chain link fence with barbed wire  or anything keeping them there.   they were nothing at all like the Nazi death camps to which they are often compared by craven and opportunistic alarmists on the Left.   To be fair, she is right.  It's not like we gassed them or anything.  But those standards are a bit low, I think.  When you have the very agency in charge of the relocation  urlLink stating  that that the housing provided was "subnormal and probably always will" and that they were nothing more than "tarpaper-covered barracks of simple frame construction without plumbing or cooking facilities of any kind. [...] one bath, laundry, and toilet building shared by upwards of 250 people." It doesn't sound all that great either.   Another forgotten bit of history: the February 1942 Japanese attack on Goleta, California -- the first foreign attack on the U.S. mainland since the War of 1812   This is an interesting, sure.  But all the ship did was fire a small gun shooting up a wooden pier.   Like the  urlLink Fu-Go  weapons, it could have been worse, something that we should all be thankful wasn't.  But this is more of trivia type information than anything else, and these actions were understandable as we were at war.  So what's her point?    Only that she's a racist bigot, like those that support her.  The worst thing is, they can get away with this because she's  urlLink Asian .
