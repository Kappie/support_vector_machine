LOL I'm rather sad, as the Tubing Rally marks the last event of the 4-H summer season, and it's on to the fall, the Fair, and the harvest! However, it does mean the start of a new 4-H year. So I have a whole new year ahead of me on board and such. 'Reflective Mode Off' - I am going to start excercising. I've got the thin thing down, now I just need some definition fo' sheezy. Since I need to start getting up early and get into the whole swing of things in terms of time cycles for school, I may take some of that extra time and take up jogging. Then I'm going to do drylands from the swim team. Oh, yeah. Grebel. - Well, I have 11 days until school begins. Time to finish Sophie's World and that textbook work! I'm glad I did all my school supply shopping earlier this month. Now all I need is a haircut and I'll be prepared. Good for me. - More than likely I will be  coaching  the Lee County 4-H Challenge Bowl team this year! That is, if there are enough Seniors this time around. I'm thinking there will be enough. If there aren't, of course I'll take the lead of the "A" team again, gladly. But, I've come to understand that things aren't about all about me. I've had my turn, gave it my best shot, and we got 3rd in the state! That's not bad, considering the top 2 were from the same county, and they cheat badly. (Sharing questions and answers with radios, anyone?) So really we placed 1st. LOL. But, I've had my turn, and I want to be a teacher and a leader now. I was elected to be a leader and that's my new role: to set an example. - I've decided to use journalism as a backup. I was told to 'find my passion' at GOT, and my passion is 4-H. Therefore, I'm going a career in 4-H. Start out as a Program Assistant in college, 4-H agent out of college, get promoted to district, then to state... and so forth. - My blog (I can't believe I still have it around!) will have a newer, less gay, name and URL. If you see this from now on, you got an email or someone told you.
