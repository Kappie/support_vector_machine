Sure in the middle of West Virginia what can one expect; but can Shawnee, Kansas really be any better? Capital High School only has 1,400 kids, Shawnee Mission North is only 400 more. Is it even possible for there to be a cute/attractive, kind, loving,  available  gay senior? Hell, I'd take a junior. I'd even date from a different school, but how fucking cool would it be if I had a boyfriend at school? It would be like the gay power couple or something, especially if we didn't bother with hiding it. I'm not saying we have to make out in class, but people notice things, right? That's the thing, I don't want to look back on my last, my final, my  senior  year and regret any moment of it. I want to have my  first  boyfriend. I want to go to prom with him. I want to enjoy high school the way you see it on TV, and movies, and just walking around any school in America. Why does gay dating in high school have to be so hard? Straight people are always hooking up with one another and they're everywhere you look. Sure, the whole homophobia and violence around my sexual preference is a problem, but in these bigger schools do we really have to worry about such things?  I'm not trying to sound conceited or anything, but I'm damn cute. Sure, I'm not the most attractive person in the world, but we all can't be models now can we? I'm smart, funny, opinionated, loving, loyal, etc., so why, exactly, does everything seem to just not work? I've come a long way since 3 years ago as the new kid, the incoming freshman, from a middle school of 600 in Suburbia, USA to a high school of 3,200 in Evanston (North Shore/North Side, Chicago). Freshman year I didn't do that well in some classes. I missed work, didn't do projects, and got my first D on a grade report. It really jolted me awake, and I brought every grade up. I didn't have any friends, save for the occasional banter with people in class, and the few friends I had. I'm grateful I knew them. They are all fabulous. Notably the ones I still talk to: Alycia and Taylor: you guys rule. We have to visit sometime; I miss you. As for my other friends, I wish I still talked to them more or even talked to them at all after that first year. I made some more friends Sophomore year for sure, but basically kept the same group.  As I was talking with  urlLink Mark  (Who along with Justin are two people who are always there to talk to, be it superficial or if I've got a problem. They may not be able to do anything directly, but having someone there is just as amazing.) last night, I looked back at my two years at Evanston, and realized how depressing they were until the very, very end. I also remember the people who subconsciously made a difference in my life. I barely remember these people, and I haven't talked to them since my freshman Biology class. Sally, Sophia, and Evan. They were basically the only people I really talked to in that class. They just made me feel so at ease. They were honestly the first group of "gay friends" I ever really knew. Before that I had no idea what these people were like. I thought that what I was feeling was some strange problem or something connected to the fact that I wasn't "cool" or "with the in-crowd" in middle school. Without them knowing, or even myself then, I started to realize who I am now. They were funny, and made me laugh, and were the most genuinely nice people you could meet. Evan especially just made you feel really comfortable. He was cute too. I realized that the first day I walked into the class, and I wish I had been able to accept myself then as I do now. For the longest time I had Sally's email, but I've lost it now. A Google search for her turns up nothing, but a Google search for Evan turns up what college he's going to, and even lists contact info (I'm not stupid enough to put it here). I know it's him, it's an Evanston address, and it says Evanston Township. I should email him just to say hi and see if he even remembers me, just for old times sake. I didn't realize he was a Junior when I was a Freshman, so I would have seen him my Sophomore year at least. Maybe I just don't remember. I feel like a bad friend now, you know? I need to talk to Alycia, and bad, and on the phone. She's the best girlfriend I've got, and she listens so well and would know what to do and even who I'm talking about even if I don't. She's amazing. No, she's fabulously divine. She's the first really-super-good-friend I came out to, and I'm proud of that. I could trust her with my life.  Moving onwards away from E-Town now. My sophomore year was uneventful and basically Freshman year with better classes and cooler classmates... I did make some new friends, like Nathan, and Jess, and Nate (who I really need to talk to again), but other than that the same old thing. Charleston was a new experience. I fit in quickly at Capital, thanks to the cool friends I've made here, and the fact that I was coming from a school almost 3 times it's size and from the big city, so I felt a little cocky about the whole thing. Junior year was great. Good grades, great fabulous friends, did well on the SAT, oh, and came out to others for the first time. I don't know if I would have done the same if I was still at Evanston. The atmosphere there was just so different, but I guess these things happen when we're ready for it. I got to know Mike, who's hilarious in his own quirky way and just has this way about him that you can't help but love. He's great with kids too, so he'll make an amazing teacher. I actually got out and did stuff. Tasha and Nikki were the other part of my trio of good friends here. We'd go see a movie just to check out the cute guys in it, or we'd go and spend a whole day at the mall walking around and having a blast or watching movies until 12:30 AM and having my mom come get me from Kanawha City without telling here where I was.  Despite my great year here in WV, and my amazing friends and experiences in Chicago, I still was never part of that clichéd popular social upper class that everyone yearns to be a part of at some point. I would kill to know the cool people and hang out with them and be in the know. I yearn for the spotlight and celebrity associated with it. You're self image takes shape as a child, and for me middle school was hell. I loved parts of it, but I was one of those kids that wasn't part of the popular group because I didn't play sports or have parents who made a certain amount of money or knew the same people since kindergarten. In a way middle school is more of a bitch than high school ever could be, just because it's so small and cliché. That kind of negativity stuck with me at E-Town, and I'm just now getting over it. Because none of the "cool" kids never even wanted anything from you but a cheap laugh or an answer to the question they couldn't get because they were goofing off in class, I had this isolated anti-social mentality. I've learned to get over that in most situations, but everything comes back to dating. One gets this idea that you should just "know what to do" when it comes to asking a guy out or that nervous first date and first kiss. Well life ain't so easy. In fact it's one of the hardest things to deal with. On top of the problems of normality preceding this sentence, you've got the more current issues to deal with. Today teenagers and early 20-somethings are too focused on the sexual aspects of it all. They don't want that romantic dating of decades past. They just want to find some girl to fuck or some guy to give it up to. I find it disgusting how there is not intimacy behind it all and it has become a game to some people. Not that I don't believe in sexual relationships, but don't fuck someone on the first date, or even the second or third. Wait until you really feel ready and right about it, and not listen to some guy who's gonna sweet-talk you into it by saying he loves you and crap. Some guys will say anything just to get you in bed. And when you do actually decide to do it, don't be stupid. Too many people have diseases these days for you to not use protection. You're saving yourself massive cost, humiliation, and health risks later on. You have so much to live for, so don't waste it on one poor decision.  This became much more than I intended. It was a rant on dating. Then it became a mini-therapy session for me. Then I started ranting about the problems of relationships. And frankly, I don't care. When I get in these moods I just need to vent. And in this case, the parts about me became a therapeutic experience. I may be talking to no one, or the world, but at least I got it out and I don't have to keep it all in my head. It's a good thing and it helps keep me sane.
