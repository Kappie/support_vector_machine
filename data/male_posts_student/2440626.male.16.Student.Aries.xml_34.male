That would so much better than whatever it is I am now.  Firstly, everyone has to write a 250 word paragraph describing our house, in FRENCH.  Secondly, I forgot my swim clothes at school, which translates to me having to bring 2 sets of stuff home tomorrow.  Thirdly, I have to finish typing the February edition of the CBYF Courier so it can be mailed out by the end of the week.  Fourthly, Jeff's Roast/Party, if I were to tell about how it is stressing me out, well it would have sub-categories...So I don't even want to begin with that.  Fifthly, Envirothon is always in the back of my head, saying "Seth, STUDY ME!"  So right know I am eating...Sociables.  Before that I had 2 slices of left-over pizza.  Oh, and another thing.  in swimming today, Jeff knocked my over with the kayak paddle.  I slipped and fell on the hard cement pool deck. Ouch! Tell me about it.  Well I am gonna go try and relax.  If that is possible.  Over and out.  P.S.  One Tree Hill was excellent last night.  Even if Peyton and Lucas didn't, well you know.
