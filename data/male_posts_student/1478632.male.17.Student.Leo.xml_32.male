Here are a few examples: --Age 0: I was born 6 weeks early with severe jaundice, I nearly died. --Age 3: I accidently ingested half of a cup of antifreeze. I almost died. --Age 7: I stepped on a stud bracket, severing a major artery in my foot and nearly bled to death. --Age 9: I was hit by a truck, completely demolishing my new bike. I stayed in the hospital's ICU for a week, then had nearly a year of rehabilitory therapy. With a major concussion, punctured lung, and broken pelvis, I wasn't in very good shape. I've never been as good at running since, and I have arthritis in my knee as well. --Age 10: My dad died of a heart attack just after leading my soccer team to a 2nd place in the town's tournament. --Age 13: Sami, my first girlfriend ditches me for another guy (23 days). My mom marries John Miner, one of the worst decisions she has made to date. --Age 14: Deanna, my second girlfriend refuses to talk to me (16 days). I still haven't found out why. Kathy, my third girlfriend dumps me the day before my 15th birthday (26 days). --Age 15: Chelsea, my fourth girlfriend, and a girl I had a crush on for almost a year, tells me that she's been cheating on me and dumps me at a school dance (6 days--and yes, she  did  cheat on me in 6 days). I meet Laura, and she starts going out with a close friend of mine, Matt. By the end of the summer, my girlfriend Sarah decides she doesn't want to risk drifting away from me during the school year and dumps me. --Age 16: I reconnect with Laura and we start dating. Three days later, she tells me that she "just isn't ready for another boyfriend," though she was the one that wanted me to ask her out. If the rest of my life is as bad as the first 16 years, I think I may want out. I have deduced that God hates me because, as you may be able to pick out from the events listed above, nearly every time I am really happy, or I start to get happy, something happens to put a quick end to that. What do you think? Comment if you wish--that's why I put that comment collector up.
