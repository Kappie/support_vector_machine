It is so much fun.  And Janet's wedding went well.  Lots of things to "drink."  Yeah, I was happy.  Well, there isn't much new in my world.  Summer gym is so much fun.  Lifting, walking, swimming, and playing organized gym activites.   Can't beat that.  No, really, you can't.  I laugh so much, it is unbearable.  I am gonna go now.
