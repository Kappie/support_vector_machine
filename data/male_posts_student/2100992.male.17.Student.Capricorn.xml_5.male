MARCH BREAK (also known as "Spring Break" to Americans). Well ya, I dont really have anything big planned out for the March Break ... Im invited to a St. Patricks Day party, im yet to make up my mind if im going to go or not, but it is a possibility.  Tonight is THE Leafs game ... The debut of Ron Francis ... How great it will be to have "The Shiznet" Ron Francis centering the line of Owen Nolan and Matt Stajan? PURE AWESOMENESS! Should be a good game though, the Pittsburg Penguins, who are clearly not making the playoffs, have been on quite the roll lately, so now its time for us to stop them and pick up 2 more points in hope of winning our Northeast Division.  Now on to this Sunday ... if you are a wrestling fan it is THE biggest day of the year ... thats right ..  WRESTLEMANIA XX!  5 hours of non-stop wrestling action that is going to rock my socks ... and of course when its live from The Scarrow Household it just makes it that much better (thats right, his mom buys   smarties!    Well thats all for now ... I shall indeed update you with Wrestlemania XX results and opinions, and I shall let all know how THE March Break of doom is.    So keep control of the pet population, have you pet spayed or neutred, goodbye everybody!
