Not as interesting as NY Times plagiarizer Jayson Blair, but still a good read.  Especially for the Boston Globe.  :)    As far as that pesky task of exam studying goes, I've finally realized: (1) I take too many notes in class, (2) I take too few notes in the casebook, and (3) I really, really should start outlining sooner in the semester.  Coming soon: my advice on taking notes in class (that I ought to actually listen to).
