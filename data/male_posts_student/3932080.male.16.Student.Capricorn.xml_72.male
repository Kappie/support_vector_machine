Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Let's Get It Started -The Black Eyed Peas  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #41  The Black Eyed Peas are starting to piss off a lot of their new mainstream fans. After releasing a pumped-up version of “Hey Mama” (only for radio airplay) that shimmied up the charts much faster than the album version would have, they tweaked the gleaming “Let’s Get Retarded” for “Let’s Get It Started,” a weaker but more commercial version that is again not available on the  Elephunk  album. Gone are the black-humored dance commands to “bop your head like epilepsy.” Gone is the novelty feel of a song that urges you to get mental. Actually, from its opening  Fergie  croon (a blatant rip of  Alicia Key’s  vocals that start “Fallin’”), the track is a mess, begging for likeability with a sellout bass line, some juiced guitar stabs, and drums that couldn’t touch  ?uestlove . Opting to push the song’s appeal by playing it beneath an  NBA Championship  commercial (like they did with “Hey Mama” in that  iPod  ad), the group wasted time advertising for  Kobe  and  Shaq  with what could have been the theme to the  Special   Olympics .   The Verdict:  4.6/10 - Brouhaha   (2.3/5)
