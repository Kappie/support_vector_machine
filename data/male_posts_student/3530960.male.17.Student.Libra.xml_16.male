It sucked because all that anyone would talk about is how we needed to do a better job so that the store could make more money. It was really pointless.   The good news was that we are creating a softball team. Tomorrow the manager is going to call up the manager of the Moorestown Panera and set up a date for us to play them.   I worked a lot this week, and I can't wait to get my paycheck on Friday. It will be really cool to actually have some money.
