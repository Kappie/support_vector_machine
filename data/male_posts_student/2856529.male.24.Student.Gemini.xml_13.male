Now in Louisiana close to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico there was a big parish called Lafayette. In Lafayette, a place named after the Frenchman who designed the national flag of France, is the University of Louisiana, Lafayette Campus. On campus is a building called Madison Hall which houses the School of Engineering. The Department of Chemical Engineering is located over here. And on the second floor in Room 214 on a computer codenamed CHEEDW2K18 I wrote my first blog. Well, in case you are wondering if this grand opening is for this blog you are wrong. It was a small non-impressive bl of a blog. But I have grander dreams now. I want to write a blog that wont end all blogs or for that matter make blogging an international pastime. I just want to blog for blogging's sake. Just about everyone I know has a website. Hell, I myself am listed on several of them. I tried creating a website several times but to tell you the truth my laziness and my impatience not to mention my lack of web designing (this one I just use as an excuse)have almost always got the better of me, but not today. As meaning less as this blog intends to be I will complete it. Well actually now that I have said taht I will complete it I can frankly think of no otehr things to write about. Well ponder on this. We type "Tell me I am listening to you" when we chat via an Instant Messenger application. How come nobody ever says "Type your feelings out onto the screen of your computer, I am reading it".
