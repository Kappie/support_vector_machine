it's nice naman eh davah?!  yung dati pala na lyrics ay "ghost in you" by counting crows. remake na yun eh, the orig was a new wave song like i said and, unfortunately, i have no idea who sang it, so anyway, mga 80s pa yun, pero yung remake itself ay matanda-tanda na rin, say, early to mid 90s? mga ganun.  yesterday was my dad's birthday. we really didn't do anything, because the night before he had all his friends over and they decided to have a sleepover! they talked all night and shared secrets like who their crushes are, then they braided their hair and had pillow fights and played crank calls on people while giggling...  ok, i dunno about you, but that totally grossed me out. let's move on.  so my sister had this friend who arranged for the five of us (me, ate, her boyfriend, her friend, her friend's brother) to watch spider-man 2 in glorietta 4. ha! my luck was getting better after all! so we got there and there just weren't any tickets, as is common on opening night as far as big name movies are concerned. luckily, my sister's friend had already pre-purchased tickets. however, it turns out we could not use them for the 6pm showing; we would have to wait for the LFS by 9pm, which was a problem because our friends had a very early curfew. they tried reasoning with their mother for an extension, but no such luck-- a minute later than the arranged time and their father would have popped a vein. with no alternative in sight, they just offered us the tickets. of course, we refused at first, but seeing what a shame it would be to waste 'em on account of they were only valid on that day, we gratefully accepted them.  we had some time to kill before 9, so i did some errands. i looked around national for two books; introduction to logic by copi and prism by, err, some dude that starts with t. well, i got prism, but copi's book is next to impossible to find. gawd, i hate that i lost that book. oh well, whatever.  it was barely 7:30 and we still had nothing to do. i went to the arcade and blew some cash. would you imagine, i was able to do 2 songs on SSR in dance dance revolution? and with a sprain, no less! and here's the kicker: i'm the fattest boy in the world!!! yeah, i actually think that's a record, me being the fattest SSR DDRer ever. anyway, i kicked the crap out of those old people who were tripping with the pad. hehehe... i still gots teh mad dancing skeelz!!!  after that, we lined up to watch the movie. i'm not gonna write a full-blown review on spider man 2, but i will make some comments. first, i liked that they didn't stick to a bonafide comic book story. what they did was, they took the characters and told a story all their own (not *that* far on their own however). this is plausible in this case because, unlike hp and lotr, you really only have to be faithful to the characters, and that they were. second, i'd say it lived up to all the hype. i mean, c'mon, there wasn't that much hype surrounding it (in comparison to the first at least), plus it really was a satisfying movie-going experience. third, the feel is much, much darker than the first, which is good because they took the geeky doctor octopus who wore tights and crap and turned him into this uber-cool psycho in a trenchcoat. wicked.  the movie wasn't perfect, though, but i'll leave that for you to find out.  what have i learned? i still gots teh mad skills baby!  completely wrong thought of the day: as you may have noticed, we had two extra tickets, since five were pre-purchased and only three were used (for my sister, her boyfriend and myself). so, we decided to give the tickets away. now, my sister's boyfriend wanted to give the tickets to children, but me and my sister agreed that that would make him look like a pedophile. my sister suggested that i approach a cute girl and say "i'll trade you these tickets for your phone number," but i didn't like that idea very much, nor do i like anything that could get me sued or arrested, for that matter. i suppose the most logical path was that of my sister, who opted to find someone with a good heart to give the tickets to. no such luck. then, she came up with the most brilliant idea of the day...  sis: i know! let's give the tickets to someone destitute! c'mon guys, help me look for poor people! me: sister... you're in glorietta 4. think about that a minute. sis: oh. right.  however, destitute or not, they were able to give away the tickets to some family. hm, i dunno why, but when things like that happen in real life, the first thing that comes to my mind is "church story." you know, like, what if that family was actually a bunch of atheists and my sister's kindness convinced them in the existence of God or something like that? you never know...
