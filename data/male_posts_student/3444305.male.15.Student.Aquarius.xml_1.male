Alright now back to my day. Yesterday, since I didn't write, I got up and got ready and drove over to my cousins house. We had a party for Matt and Annie because it was there birthday this week. And then me and Michael were staying over at Matt's for the night. We could of went swimming, because they have a heated inground pool which is hott, but we decided not to. We decided to bug our aunts and uncles till one of them took us driving. Which finally Danny did. I was the best driver because I'm just that hott. Michael you ran the stop sign. Matt was actually okay for a 14 year old. And then we rode the Gator, which is the coolest little truck thing in the world. And then I freaked out Michael by acting like I was on something. It was pretty funny, I actually made it really believeable. Then we talked online and went to bed. We got up, and Michael had to leave to go play in the band, so me and Matt just rode the Gator around and then he took me home. Now I'm there and my uncle and cousins are over on my dad side to have a cook out thing. I still need to take a shower though. I read some of the comments and they keep coming in. I still don't see why people come here if they don't like me. Oh and Mercer, I knew it was you who wrote it. CJ told me, well not me but he can't keep his mouth shut. And I found it hilarious how you still called me 5 times, and even asked me to your birthday party. But I was a nice guy and wasn't mean even though I knew you said all that. And I do kinda feel bad that I accused CJ and Tejas when it was you. But thats how life goes. Now, like I said. If you don't like it here. Leave. You are hurting people that shouldn't even be hurt. I'm not saying I'm not either, but this whole this is over now. No more about it, or it will be deleted. Because I'm almighty like that. Well I need to go take a shower! Happy Memorial Day everyone! And don't forget to say thanks to a verteran! Later.
