As soon as the starting music comes on 'Heartbeat (do do do do)',  I immediately try to switch off and ignore the crap that is on the TV  I know it could be because I didn't get my Sunday super sleep (heehee;)) but I actually feel asleep halfway through Heartbeat. Seriously.   I woke up, and I seriously didn't know what the hell was going on.   I know what you're all thinking, why didn't I just turn it over? But my mum came home from work early, and I haven't got power over what we're watching (sucks dunnit?), I wanted to watch Star Wars :(
