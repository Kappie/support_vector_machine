(well amber will be driving again in a month. she would have still been driving now but what can i say? you just gotta watch out for those mini-vans.) but i was excited about that and i didn't have to go to swim team! i think the word i'm looking for is: cha-ching!... today was great when come to think about it...  yours truly also got like the coolest/nicest note ever. and what a shocker its from the coolest person ever, Amber. it perked me up so much this morning and that was massively needed. seriously i can't think of any bad things about the girl. she's that person who when i see her i can't help but smile. everybody should be able to have someone like that. liz said that she hopes we'll go out cause we'd make an "interesting couple". is that necessarily good? i'm not quite sure. it better be (insert the wannabe mean face of the white guy in "half baked").  to wrap it all up my day was awesome and you'd be lucky if yours was half as good.
