Youth Group was like I predicted, like having hot pokers shoved down my throat. Hot pokers of fun! It was actually fun, because of the pizza and the Comstockery and the fact that everyone there pretty much has ADD and Patty reminds me of every Elementary school teacher I've ever had, trying desperately (and failing to keep me on task.)  Also the "Meryl Streep is the Meryl Streep of Acting!" article came from  urlLink here . There's Chicago stuff for Erin there as well, which brings me to my second point. I am spoiler free for Episode Three, which is to say that I really don't give a crap one way or another, but I am a "Spoiler-Whore for Episode IV!" (It's funny because it already happened.)   Thomas:  Come to the Scene Shop! And Do the Friday Five!  This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.
