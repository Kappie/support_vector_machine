IT KNNNEEWWWWW!! did the dog send you?  YOU SEE!! IT CHANGES COLOR WHEN IT DRIES! IT NEVER STAYS!! I HAVE TO KEEP THE WALL WET!!  make him die, daddy! (what makes this really funny is the little kid pointing at happy noodle boy with his ape-like dad standing behind him. you can almost  hear  the little boy's high-pitched, whiny voice...sooo funny...)  dear die-ary, today some friends came over.  oh. it's such a beautiful night. i think i'll kill myself. what else is there to do? it's so incredibly lovely out, and it's not as if anyone is goign to drop by, though, on nights like this, i wish somebody would. i really don't want to be alone right now. another one of these nights. well this time i'll make sure that there aren't anymore!! no more dreaming for real friends! no more stars for me to be alone under!! no more!!! i'm blowing through that lid!! i'm going over the stars.  "that commercial where the whole family gets diarrhea is on!!!" "mommy! aaaaargh! *sploooosh*"  a delicious snack: yum! air!  or maybe 'pretty' people like you and your high little friends don't remeber people like me. the ones you make fun of for lack of anything better to do. my pain amuses you does it? how is it that you're so beautiful, and so fucking ugly inside!! heh!! i could just chop your brain out! it doesn't deserve such a pretty body!!! but i won't! i'm better than that. your shit is hidden in good looks but i can smell it! i'm not so nice to look at, but inside...inside i'm...i'm...uh... dear die-ary, today i learned that on the inside, i'm pretty fuckin' ugly.  "don't let the beautiful moon set! capture it! freeze it! forever in time with never teh memory of losing it to another day!!" "nny? what are you doing?" "immortalizing the moment."  "excuse me, there's something wrong with the brainfreezy machine." "nothing's wrong. we turn them off after 2 a.m." "oh. then that's it. no stopping it now. i'm going to kill myself."  to achieve this shot, we first made a plaster mold of the actor's head. we then filled it with cow parts. then. for realism, we surprised the actor by blowing a hole through his head. (actors should all be surprised this way.)  i stared, motionless, before the mirror. as always, i stayed until i'm convinced that there is no glass, nothing separating me from the room i see on the other side. i imagine that everything is different. over there. better. there are people in that world, who i would like. but, like always, my hand hits that glass. i know that if i'd only waited just one more second...  i think that's good for today. and also because i'm watching boy meets world. and nothing can really compare with kory and tapanga's search for a home with a nook. damn eskimos always standing in the way...  anyway. three's company has to be the worst show ever aired on television. nick at nite in general has turned into a dissapointment. i used to stay up all night watching laveren and shirley, happy days, the brady bunch, and i love lucy. sometimes i would watch all in the family, but since archie bunker died, that show makes me sad. but i named my car after him. i kind of just assume that both zoloft and bunker are my cars, since i named them. and bunker is really nice, but i learned to drive in zoloft. so do i go for my "firstcar" or the hot,nicer volvo? man, i wish i had these kind of decisions to make with guys. anyway, it's not really up to me. it's up to my paraents. but back to tv, three's company is a terrible, terrible show. the rest of the nick at nite run is ok i guess. cheers is one of my favorite shows ever, and i grew up on full house and the cosby show (and cheers, but we already talked about that. where everybody knows your naaaammmee ba ba ba and they're always glad you caaaaammmeee ba ba ba...you know, the ba ba ba's aren'tsheep, but the instrumental bangs that go between phrases.) but wings, roseanne, and three's company are  terrible.  i've never acctually watched roseanne. but i despise john goodman. he keeps dominating what's left of good disney movies. i can't get away from him. like monsters inc. and the emp's new groove. great movie, that one. and i never liked roseanne either. acctually, i don't think i've ever seen roseanne do anything. tay tay said that the series finale of roseanne made him cry even though he had never seen another episode of it, but that's tay. he cries at everything. i'm one to talk...and wings is alot like cheers, in that there's a lseezy guy always hitting on the blond girl, only cheers is incredibly better. they used to show family ties too, which was an  awesome  show. the last time i was at a footloose thing, we decided that every time keller walks in the room, we all say "keller!" like it was cheers and norm had just walked in. the saddest moment of my life was on the cheers series finale when norm walked in the new bar and no one said norm. it was terrible. and i've seen every episode of full house, so nothing is new and surprising there. basically, nick at nite needs to replace three's company with family matters, the other show i grew up with. and i've been urkel-less for far too long.  i was thinking the other day that i am incredibly lucky to have been a kid when i was. sesame street was awesome when i watched it, and after sesame street i could change the channel and watch the price is right every weekday. and barney was acctually an ok show back in the day, with that little girl who had her teddy bear. and there was arthur, and wishbone, and bill nye the science guy, and lambchop (this is the song that never ends yes it goes on and on my friends some people started singing it not knowing what it was! and they all just kept singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends yes it goes on and on my friends some people started singing it not knowing what it was! and they all just kept singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends yes it goes on and on my friends some people started singing it not knowing what it was! and they all just kept singing it forever just because this is the song that never ends...) and mr. roger's neighborhood and shining time station (yeah ringo starr! i watched that show every day just for ringo, who is apparently not dead yet. just like teh guy in monty python who says "i'm not dead yet!" because they're both not dead yet and they're both british. gotta love the british. unless you're my mom i guess...) and where in the world is carmen sandiego (which sparked my entire interest in acappella music) and reading rainbow. all great shows about education. for that age group today, there exist dora the explorer, bob the builder, bear in the big blue house, and sesame street. and blues clues i guess. then, after we passed the pbs phase, we still were in good tv. remeber tgi fridays, with full house and family matters and step by step or whatever? and saved by the bell? and of course, boy meets world? after we started growing, there were tons of those family tv shows that taught important lessons in interesting ways.   then came the early teenage years. after the simpsons peaked, michelle tanner fell off a horse and caused the twins to sepparate into michelle tanner 1 and michelle tanner 2, party of five ended, and nash bridges went off the air, we still had friends to hang on to. good old friends. we were finally old enough to understand just shoot me and spin city and suddenly susan. plus that awesome superman show with that lady from bond and that guy from ripley's believe it or not. i watched that show all the time. our family would all crowd aroudn to see what would happen next to superman and lois lane, and it was such a cute,romantic, action show. we'd do thatfor nash bridges too, which i don't really remeber. and jag. jag is a good show.and, as always, there was still boy meets world.nickelodeon even hit its high point, with shows like hey arnold, spongebob, invader zim (damn you for cancelling it! DAMN YOU!!!) catdog, the fairly odd parents. most of those shows still run, which is good. my siblings at least have something good to watch.  which brings us to the present day. we have friends reruns, cheers reruns, will and grace, boy meets world reruns, even stevens, more reruns of good shows, and an incredible invention called adult swim. the family guy, futurama, and all that anime is awesome. but no matter what barrett says, aqua teen hunger force is probably the stupidest show EVER. i admit it had one good moment, with the meat bridge thing. but that was IT. and sealab used to be funny. in all honesty though, nothing can compare to the family guy baby plotting his mother's death or bender doing just about anything.i LOVE that baby. so we have good tv shows now.  but gaze into the future for a moment. in a few short years, television will be overcome by reality tv shows like fear factor, the swan, american idol, america's next top model, temptation island, survivor, big brother (you know i never got the title of that show until 1984. not the year.), that one show with donald trump, forever eden, and even that new one called "amish in the city." they're terrible. i hate reality tv. except for trading spaces and america's next top model. trading spaces is like the best design show i've ever seen, with the exception of that 70's house. oh, add that 70's show to the list of good shows we still have.  so my kids will see nothing but trashy reality televison. that pisses me off. and disney is crap now. pixar is the only current hope for my children. pixar and dreamworks and new line cinema. because the notebook and lord of the rings are both new line productions, and by that standard, new line is the best film company EVER.
