I can't talk to the women I would like to.. I will have to be alone as I have been for most of my life.. all the girls that I want to spend time next to meare busy doing other things so I will be at work or writing or listening to music or just plain doing other things..  There are women that I have wanted to spend time with for years and that wil lnever happen and I am used to it..  I know this sounds liek a pitiful sap but I am strong and not going to be weakened by anyone..  I will listen to my music and be  happy and proud and love myself in the way that I have my whole life.. I wish you were as lucky as me to be as proud of the life ou lead as me.. here is some tunes by the Dropkick Murphys that help me get on with life when all the beautiful people want nothing from me but to be "Good friends"...   I'm a pitiful site  And I ain't all that bright  I'm definitly not chisled from stone  I'm a cheat and a liar  No women's desire  I'll probably die cold and alone   My good buddies The Murphys...
