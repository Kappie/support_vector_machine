Aaron and my rocket launcher is finished! We're launching our air/water rocket on Monday in periods one and two.  Today sucked because I had 200 minutes of maths - four periods. It wasn't very good =(. In Maths B I learnt basic differentiation. I was interested in it because in Maths C the grade 12s are doing it all the time. It looked interesting. But, really, it wasn't. It was a real anticlimax and it was really depressing.  I'm getting my computer back tomorrow morning. New motherboard and new RAM. Yay. Pfft, damn lightning strikes causing power surges *mumble mumble*.  I wonder if anyone reads this. Pfft, probably not. Why would ya?
