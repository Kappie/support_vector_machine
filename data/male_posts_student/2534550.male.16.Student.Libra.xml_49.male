On mondays for three hours we have Mr. McConnell, and on Wednesdays we have Mr, Kujac. Haha yesterday with Mr. Kujac was getting hella mad because these people in our class are so sorry to say dumb and they havent taken math for like 30 years or something so there all like over 30 and in Algebra 2. But hes the funniest teacher because hes like yelling "you have to attack the problem or else the problem with kick you ass" lol that was fun. And then on mondays Mr. McConnell is all nice and stuters and seems like he is more afraid of his students. Then come tues when i have psyc 250 or something which is a child psycology class. Our teacher is so wierd because shes like crazy. She smiles way to much and shes like love everyone there all your friends. So I think that overall my experience at the college on Mon-Wed nights.  Suprisingly im not stressed though, Im a prosecuting lawyer for the Atomic Bomb which is ALOT of work, I have to college classes, forensic science, and digital media, and still im not stressed at all. I think that the reason that im not stressed is because I get to have a little relief on sundays in Concord. Just being in that atmosphere is good for me and the ride there, home, and eating in Taco seems to keep me pretty level in terms of my stress level. Well anyways work time Payce.
