DO NOT take honors chemistry with brewer. this guy loves homework and there's been about one whole day we haven't had that. can't wait until swim team starts (insert sarcasm). besides that life is pretty good/easy going. this weekend should have a couple of highlights. there's a party and i'll probably end up at the mall. 2 things that are never bad. so today i was walking home with liz and i heard about the funniest thing ever. she has a jewish lady for 10th period and she's like "this lady would be a nazi if she wasn't so jewish". i about cried. score 10 points for anti-semitism. on that note i'll catch up with this thing later. promise.
