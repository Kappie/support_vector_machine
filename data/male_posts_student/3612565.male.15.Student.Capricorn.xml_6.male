A friend of mine is a very talented writer, and it was his blog that inspired me to "remodel" mine the way I have. I'd like to be able to write about important things, but it's easier done than said. I've never really been good at expressing my feelings, whether because I just didn't want to share them, or because I didn't think that anyone would care or understand. Anyway, I'm going to try harder this time around and hopefully this will make for a more interesting read than Die Kartoffeln. :P
