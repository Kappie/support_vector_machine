In the throws of passion people make so many promises that are broken. You're swimming in a sea of happy feelings until one day you get a cramp and start to drown. Then all the "I love you"s all of the claims that you'll be together forever are brought to nothing. You didn't stick together the way you said you would. The feeling of hurt and disappointment from this is amplified a thousand times by the fact that you were willing to followthem to hell and back, but they drop you on the first bad day. It hurts, but you've gotta move on I suppose. Losing a friend never feels good, but I suppose getting hurt is an unavoidable part of life...  On the upside, I have a boyfriend now. Its that Matt guy I was talking about in my last post. I went to his house last night and met his family. Very colorful group of people if I do say so... Anyways, after an extensive makeout session that was one of the BEST I've ever had, he asked me out and I said yes. I'm definately the lucky one in this relationship. Its not everyday you find someone who's smart, romantic, AND cute all in one bundle. Hopefully this will last for a long long time. If not, I'll just have to add him to my collection of frozen pelvises... MUAHAHAHAHAHA.  Moral of the Story: Like the great falls the bedrock of my life is eroding... ERODING....   EEERRROOODDDIIINNNG
