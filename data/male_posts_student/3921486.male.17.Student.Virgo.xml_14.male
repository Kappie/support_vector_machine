The bus was late and we talk to everyone and it seem like everyone was going to different places but only one bus came. We though it's not going to be our bus but everyone got one it and we were the only one left and we went to ask and good thing we did b/c we needed to get in there.  The bus took us to San Gabriel and we abort another bus. (2hrs) That bus took us to Solvang, an Dannish town. In Solvang we had an hour and half to have lunch and look around. We ate at this Dannish restaurant that was expensive and not that great of food. Then we walk around and bought some stuff at the gift shop.  After that we went to Hearst castle. (2hrs) We got to go on another bus to get us up to the castle. That ride took around 15 minutes and it was scary b/c we were going up hill in a small lane and there no rails on the side in case if the bus tip over it will save us from rolling down the hill. The castle was big and has a lot of fine art. The stairs were crowed and small to go through. The views from the castle on the balcony is amazing. There were 2 giants pools that was very cool.  After hearst castle it was another hour and half to get to our dinner place. We went to a buffet that the tour guide recomended us and it wasn't that good. We had an hour for dinner and then we would head back to our MOTEL.  The Motel wasn't nice at all and there wasn't that many channels on t.vs, only 14 channels. On top of that we had to wake up at 4;15 am to leave at 5:am to go to yosemite.  The drive to Yosemite was almost 3 hours and one hour of it was in the forest with the bus turning every 5 second. There wasn't much there at Yosemite excepts TREEEEEEESSSSSSS. We had an hour there to look around. We went to see that water fall but was dissapointed b/c there was only a little bit of water coming out of it. After seeing that we had breakfast which was expensive, 8 bucks for a plate of 2 strips of bacon, a scop of potatoes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bread and a milk for 8 bucks. well actually it's not that bad comparing to that Dannish restaurant.  We got back on the bus and stay in there for almost 3 hours to San Fransico. Once we got off, we went on a San Francisco cruise on the Red and White boat. The cruise was nice and we got to see some seagull flying right near the boat. It was a fun ride on the boat. I got to see Alcatraz Island, the view of the city and dissapointed not to be able to catch Angel Island. Good thing we got some gifts after we got off the bus b/c after the cruise we had to get on the bus right away to go to China town.  China town was interesting to see. We had dinner at this place that the tour guide recomend and it sucks. The service was horrible and they mess up my food but i ate a little bit of it so they're were like okay you can just eat that and i was like it's okay, and i was hungry and i would feel kind of bad for them.  After that dinner, we walk around and this Japanese lady join us also and for dinner too b/c she was by herself and she sat next to me on the bus. after dinner we went on the bus and drove almost an hour to finally a nice 4 star hotel. Nice rest room with nice shower and stuff to use with a nice view and a lot of channel on T.V. We got up at 6:15 and went on the bus around 7.  We get to go see this garden where there a weird rode that i can't really describe but all it is, is just flowers. After the garden we got som Dim Sum and this Chinese restuarant. It took awhile for the lady to come around with the food but the Dim Sum was good and decent price.  After that it was just the ride home. Drove for 2 hours and stop at a pit stop to have lunch. Had some Taco Bell and some ice cream. When we were almost home, 40 minutes away from our last stop. The bus engine stop and we had to sit in the freeway for 2hrs and it was freaking HOT!!!!!   Details.  People I sit next 2. Day one: someone wife for like 30 mintutes then change bus and sat next to one of the tour guide.. Day two: sat next to a Japanese lady that was nice. Day three: sat next to this teenage punk that was older than me.   People in the bus:  The majority of the people were asian except for 5 out of 50. There was some tall mo fo asian people.   Sleep at:  First night was at this crappy motel that was kind da nasty but it's okay. Second night was at a nice hotel that was very clean. Third night was at my sister husband mother house, there was an extra room.  Things I ate: First day: Dannish food, cold roasted beef, rocky road fudge, then a buffet. Second day: Breakfast at yosemite, egg, potatoes and bacon. a hot dog in the cruise and ginger ale. Then later at a chinese restaurant that had bad service. Third day: Dim Sum for breakfast with tea and later Taco Bell quesadilla and one taco.  Overall it was a great experience. Tiring for sitting in the bus for hours. Disgusted from having to us different kind of bathroom all the time, some are just plain nasty. I didn't like how we had a time limit in each places where we get drop off b/c we don't have enought time to do what we want. We were late a couple of times to the bus.  Places visit. Solvang Hears Castle Yosemite -The water fall San Francisco -Golden Gate Bridge -Alcatraz -supposely Angel Island but I didn't see it. -China Town
