Inside the comedy club, we hear a comedian making fun of someone's appearance:  "Look at this guy, just look at him! I've never seen a tail like this in South Island ever! And it's  purple !" Sitting in the crowd is a chameleon with an upside-down horn. "Umm, I  really  don't think you should be making fun of him. He kinda has a short temper...." "And will you look at this hair! It like, goes up in 'V' shape! And it's green, to boot!" Suddenly, the hedgehog he was making fun of thrusts his fist in front of the guy's throat, and two claws come out of each side of his knuckles. A third one between the two comes out and goes right up against the comedian's throat (if you've ever seen X-men, remember the seen in the bar with Wolverine and the wrestling opponent? Just think of that when you read this scene). "Have you ever seen a red neck?" says the hedgehog. Meanwhile, everyone is dashing out the door. Except the purple chameleon. "Oohh, Sa2b! Every time we come here, you go and chase off another comedian! Can't we come here once without you flipping out?" "Sorry, Camo," says Sa2b, as he takes his claws away from the comedian's throat. The man then runs off. "Come on," says Camo, "before he calls the police." Sa2b and Camo vanish in a puff of smoke and reappear outside. Suddenly, someone yells, "THAT'S THEM!" The two brothers turn around to see at least four police cars. "Oh, fudge," says Camo. "They get here pretty fast, don't they?" says Sa2b.   TO BE CONTINUED...  -Sane Intolerant-
