Baaaaaah     urlLink  What's your sexual perversion?      Created by  urlLink ptocheia     Yes. Tonight was good. I think. I'm not really sure. It was filled with awkward moments fo' sho. But it was filled with people, which was different, and some of the people I actually wanted to spend some time around. So that was cool.  I have an amazing ability to not know whether I have a crush on someone or not. I'll be sure on it, and then I'll see them and think I was wrong, and then have a conversation and change my mind again, and then I end up back where I started, which is thinking about sex. But I think I'm good. I got out of the house with some decent results, so I think my ego is slowly being rebuilt.  And he talked to me! Not crush dude, but dude who doesn't speak to me dude. It was certainly interesting.  But when it was just me and crush dude and Leigh and random chick, things went pretty okay. We were talking, and laughing, and having fun. And then my knees started to spasm, which was pretty strange. But I had fun. Which is probably important.  My hands are drunk. I can't explain it, but they have that sort of dull radiant warmth that you get, or at least I get. But I would get this in my cheeks. So I don't know why it's in my hands, especially since I haven't been drinking.  Hands, you are strange.  I'm going to bed now. And tomorrow I'm going to have a bunch of fun with Shiranne,  and everything is going to be awesome. Life is good.
