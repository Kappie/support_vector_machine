The rehashing of the John Williams score from the first one was a bit dissapointing - it's all well and good to have themes - but it felt like nothing was really added to this one musically. I loved Kenneth Brannaugh - he made me laugh. There was a good deal of slapstick comedy which made me laugh out loud also.  I appear to be a bundle of joy for everyone I know. That's splendid.  One of my friends took up cigar smoking. Good for her. Hope she doesn't die or anything.   I want to write more, but I'm building up a hate on for things right now, so I'm telling me to fuck off. Fuck off me.
