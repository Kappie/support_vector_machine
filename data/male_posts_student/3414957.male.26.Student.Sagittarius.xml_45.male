I am not looking for a filler relationship. I want to look for the long term. She is so great and I could see her in my future and hopefully she can see me in hers. We went to the V-Mall and walked around and then we sat at the food court and just talked about all the things we were feeling, what we liked in a relationship and what we didn't like in a relationship. I think she might have been holding back a little, but that's probably wrong. I was so happy that she was even talking about having a relationship with me and I cant wait to see her. She is my number 1 thought. Runners up in my thought category are: Steve Nash, Microsoft, Catcher In The Rye, Love, Friendships, My Dog, Washing my truck, building web sites, writing some sort of book, drawing, sore legs and feet, Bob Ross, and many many others.
