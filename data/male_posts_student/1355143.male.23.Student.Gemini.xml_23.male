Some good stuff on there, and Icelandic cowboy was a hit with my best friend. As for the Idol craze, I have watched American Idol a few times and World Idol once, but I find myself inexplicably nackered (spelling?) about 20 seconds into the show. World Idol is a bit better because you can cheer for a particular country. The chubby Norwegian fella that sang like Bono impressed me, but he needs some serious dental work...I thought he was English at first.  Simon would have ripped him a new one for that.   Well, I went bar-hopping last night. I borrowed an ID from someone who was borrowing it from someone(since little Timmy is still not of age here in the US) and made the rounds. Even managed to find an Irish pub, though the music was shit. I went to an Irish pub for lunch the other day and my waiter was Mexican. I was a bit peeved since we were the only people in the place for lunch, and there were 2 perfectly Irish waiters sitting on their asses, but no, we get the Mexican. And the worst was he was trying to pull off some Irish accent, when it was quite obvious he didn't get that tan on Ireland's sunny shores. When we finished, he asked if we were done, and when we said yes, he said "No mas?" While it reminded me of Barcelona, I nevertheless thought "I would've gone to a Mexican restaurant if I wanted a taste of Mexico." I suppose I should get used to it with Bush's wonderful new immigration plan...don't even get me started. Basically, "Hey, let's encourage illegal immigration." Another brilliant idea from Georgie. New book out, "American Dynasty" or some such, about the Bush clan. Looks to be decent for any interested. Might well be shit, but I automatically grant it some merit since it bashes the Bush dynasty.  Hung out last night with a friend who was in Ireland with me. It was good to reminisce, but hearing her talk so much about Ireland made me realize how much fun I had in Barcelona. Barcelona is by far the more vivid in my mind, and I don't think that's just because it is the most recent. I truly think it's because of the people I was with in BCN. Thanks again to all. I head down to school this Wednesday for Conor's 21st birthday, the same Conor that visited me in BCN. I've got a little absinthe from Andorra up my sleeve. Hopefully there are no fatalities.  Well, Adam and Ulli will be happy to know that I finally got my first cell phone of my own. Well, I guess it's not really my own, but pretty much. My girlfriend's mom bought it but doesn't like it, so she's giving it to me, along with the contract. It's the Sony-Ericsson camera phone...got it for free, so that ain't bad. I will no longer force people to be my phone pimps, a la Ulli. (But Ulli, I would highly recommend your services to others, along with your banking services). I hear Adam's raking in the dough...assume it's the same for others. Myself, I'm just a big bum, living off the state. The welfare and food stamps should arrive any day now.   I find myself hopelessly lost on some points of Americana upon my return. I'm absolutely clueless as to what's been going on in American football and the NBA, so people try to make conversation and I stare at them like some big, dumb oaf. "Must've missed that game," I mutter. Going through a bit of mullet withdrawal here at home, as that whole fad is quarantined to tiny holdout factions of Def Leppard fans in the Deep South (ask Constance for confirmation). But when I really miss mullets, I just look at pictures of Adam's last haircut. Would've been better off with a bowl, Adam.   I was excited to see at the latest national car show that the major car companies are all unveiling their new lines of gas-electric hybrid cars. Maybe if we buy enough of them, Georgie will cease meddling in the Middle East. Liberating the Iraqi people, my ass. Three letters for ya....O-I-L....period. I think that's how it's spelled. But that's enough political rambling on my part. A Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.
