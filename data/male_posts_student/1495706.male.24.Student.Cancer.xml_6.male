And rather than sitting in a bar with a nice buzz, or drifting through a nice dream while curled up in bed I'm here.  Awake.  Willing my brain to come up with something profound and revelatory so that this paper I have to write is, well, profound and revelatory.  And that's not happening, though with the amount of time I've spent on education I should have the profound flowing like wine.  Or whatever the appropriate phrase would be.  My paper and I even came to the conclusion that just finishing would be acceptable, and yet my brain still won't put out.  Shameful.
