It's coming back in 2005 for a supposed 39 new episodes, which is awesome, but, for now, I'm going to talk about the top 10 of my favorite episodes, similar to what I did with Rocko's Modern Life last night and this morning.  For now, here's #10-6, and tomorrow, I'll post the rest.    10. Peter Peter Caviar Eater What's funny about this one, is that Lois's aunt comes to visit her, and the second Lois opens the door when she arrives...she dies.  So, the Griffin Family inherits her large mansion with all of her stuff.  So, in musical form, Peter sings about how "this house is freakin' sweet."  But, not all remains good, because Peter makes enemies in the town, and sends them all straight back to Quahog.  9. There's Something About Paulie This one kind of integrates the "Quahog Mafia," as it can be called.  Peter trys to get Lois to buy a second car (which, ironically, is made completely out of cardboard).  It all ends with the mafia calling a hit on Lois, and they attend the leader's daughter's wedding, where he grants everyone he wants one wish.  Peter accidentally uses his wish, and has to convince them to call off the hit.  This one is classic.  8. Brian Does Hollywood Brian decides he's not wanted around, so he goes off to Hollywood to direct porn films.  What's not funny about that?  7. Road to Rhode Island Stewie and Brian try to get on a plane, and Stewie is trying to get on with a crapload of weapons, and makes a mention about Osama bin Laden.  This was edited in the American version due to 9/11.  6. Fifteen Minutes of Shame Meg is embarassed by her family, so she puts them all on a talk show.  The Griffin family becomes a reality show.  Meg can't stand it, so she moves in with the neighbors.  Then, a sexy blonde replaces her.  Then, the whole family realizes that it isn't right, and they also quit.  And that's it for tonight.  Be sure to check out tomorrow morning for the remainder of the top 10.  Until then, go sleep er something.
