I have submitted not only one.. but TWO pictures of me playing Counter-Strike at a LAN party for the yearbook peeps.  Oh boy.  Why did I do that...? I'm not sure, but I guess it will be funny to look at in several years and say "Why oh why did I do that to myself."  And of course other people will still be laughing when they are middle-aged and still trucking along at whatever career they end up in.  Of course I had to go to "Xtremez II" (a nearby LAN cafe)  to play some CS with my usual buds.  It was awesome.  Although the competition isn't always very good.  It takes me forever to warm up though so I end up doing bad for about 10-15 minutes.  That's impressive for me!  Anyways, no one cares about this so I'll move on to the usual random crap.  You know that guy Macbeth?  I think some Bonespear guy or some (name here)spear or other wrote it... Hmm, the name escapes me... : )  MACTEST! MACTEST! MACTEST! *Banquo raises his outstretched grasping hand towards Macbeth out of the dinner platter*AH!  Not the final Macbeth test... MACFINAL!  *Keyzer slaps Drew and Colin in the chest repeatedly*  *Keyzer laughs far too much for his own actions*  By the way, for you geeks: New roll-up keyboard on the way soon to my humblehome from ThinkGeek.com: http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/input/keyboards/5a7f/  Que Chevere! Y Que Caliente!  Te amo Justo Lamas!  Boy, that concert was... neat!  What an awesome day, again!  Crew and school? Awesome at the same time? d00d!? I'm a geek.  I need that shirt proclaiming that....  I just have to have it. Someday.
