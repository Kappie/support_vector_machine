Everything else in this house was good 10 years ago too. Ten years seems to be the life-expectancy of anything with plastic parts. We have to replace the dishwasher, the fridge, the washer, the dryer (drier?.. That aint right), my fathers computer, my computer, my stereo (started malfunctioning today), we needed a new TV on our current TVs tenth birthday (about 3 years ago). My dads van, after almost 200,000 miles on it, is going screwy. My mom's van, which is less than 4 years old and has about 80K miles on it, needs a new transmission. My car, the 1986 Dodge Aries with 29,000 miles on it, died, so now I need a new car. I'm looking at buying a 1970's Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. It's incredibly badass, maybe too badass for me. My grandmother bought every one of her grandkids their first car--every one except me. I'm looking to guilt-trip her into buying me the Cutlass. If she doesn't give me the $3500 I'm gonna kill her, cause I know I'm in her will. Let this be a lesson to you all. Don't waste your time by trying not to "waste" your money-- Frugality only buys frustration... Buy better than what you need, as you need it. so, while I could live without the following things, I'm going to say I NEED these things: A powermac G5-$2900, a Fodera Monarch (bass)- $3500-7000 depending on whether I get the 'cheap' model or not, An Acoustic upright bass-$2000+, a new old car-$3500-4000, Norah Jones' hand in marriage, a pet squirrel that wears a Japanese Flag headband, the new rediculously expensive Jaco Pastorius release, and most importantly a job. I need a means of acquiring the money to buy the above shit... I don't know how I'm going to manage the Norah Jones thing though...  I didn't shower today. Is anyone else turned on by their own stink? Makes me think about whether I'd have sex with my clone... Ya know?...  anyone... anyone... Bueller?
