Everyone cheer, do the hokey pokey, and turn yourselves around. I have been asked to actually follow up on my earlier comment, "LC Players sucks." This is why it sucks. We have no money and we get no time to do anything. Horrigan never gives us enough time to rehearse stuff. We have a performance on Tuesday, and what did we spend last Monday doing? Playing random waste-of-time improv games! And then she has the nerve to criticize how I blocked the play after having me block about half of it in one class period. Grrr. But it's all cool, because I got to be in the senior Lyceum picture! :) Important news! The fanfiction.net search is working again, so everybody go there and type in The Shifty Troublemaker. Remember, that SW humor parody script with drug-induced penguins I keep talking about? If you haven't read it yet, read it. If you have, then review it so that it may get updated and finished! It's funny, I promise!  That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!
