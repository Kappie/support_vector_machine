Dan Beck is so great! i dont know how him and Nathanial do it. they seem to have it SO together its nuts. i wish i could totally just change right now. just a total 180, and get back on that right track. worship, praise, bible study, prayer, everything. i keep asking myself like...how could i be all about the faith for years, then just completely walk away? its amazing how far ive grown from my church family and God. it getting to be ridiculous. i would love to just hang with dan n nate and learn and grow with them, but i dont know how i would do it. i dunno, im clueless. and  im writing on here like a friggin girl.
