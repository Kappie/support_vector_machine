Went to a local park (no Parc Guell, but hey), got down on the ol' knee in a secluded part of the park and popped the question. She said yes (makes the story better, in my opinion, although a bit less interesting). So as y'all (haha) are not confused, my girlfriend will be referred to hereon out as "my fiancee." Nah, just kidding about all that, but it is kinda scary thinking of her as my fiancee. Scary in a good way, though. Like we're growing up. That's the scary part I guess...accelerating into the brick wall that is life after Uni. Wanted you guys to be among the first to know, though. Cava sent by express air post would not go unappreciated ;) But alas, time to hit the pit, as our brethren on the country/continent say.  Tim  PS-Enjoyed Vegard's post about the "yellow fellows." I've decided that from this day forth I will live vicariously through Vegard (sorry Adam, you were a close second).
