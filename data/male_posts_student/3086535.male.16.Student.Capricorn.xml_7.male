He takes a position some feet from Kusari, taking a few practice swings at rocks and the such. As he does so he speaks to her, "You are a knight of Karchan? I hope to join your ranks soon." After warming up a bit he closes the distance between himself and Kusari, quickly coming up on her left side. He tosses the halberd forward a little, letting it slide forward in his hand until he is gripping the wooden handle near the bottom. Jardel stops about seven feet from Kusari, just out of range of swords and the like, but his eight foot halberd along with his arm length should easily be able to reach Kusari. He decides that for his first attack he will go in simply, to the point. He steps one foot forward and swings the halberd up over his head, fulling extending his hand he brings it crashing down for her shoulder, the axe blade side facing Kusari.  Kusari notices Jardel's chest muscles twitch and is alerted that he will attack. She sees the weapon swing and ducks down into a forward, seconds before what would have been a beheading. Rolling to her feet, the Silver Knight rises inches before Jardel. She raises her for arm to block out a swing of the mighty weapon before answering, "Yes, I am." In a lithe movement of her left leg, she hooks it behind Jardel. The arm blocking his arm pushes forward, using the man's weight against him to destroy his balance. She quickly raises her longsword, before thrusting down knowing that Jardel must act quickly risking either a deadly blow or allowing himself the vulnerability of a fall.  Jardel allows himself to fall backwards, knowing the longsword would do too much damage if he tried to regain his balance. He falls backwards and as he falls his hand finds his double-bladed battle-axe in the belt loop at his side. He pulls it free with one hand and continues pulling it straight across his chest as he falls, trying to deflect Kusari’s sword tip with the flat side of the blade. He pulls it a little too quickly and the top of the axe slams into the side of the sword, sending it a little to the side but still on it’s downward path into his shoulder. The sword tip digs in as soon as his body slams into the ground. Jardel groans lightly and grabs the flat of the blade with his gauntleted hand. He tugs it free of his chain and plate armor, thankful he decided to wear it. Jardel rolls to the side, not an easy task to accomplish in all that armor. He slowly stands and inspects the wood quickly, the tip having only dug in a little, more pain coming from the ringlets digging into his flesh. He takes hold of the battle-axe with both hands and moves around until his halberd is between himself and Kusari. He moves at her in a pace a little more than a quick walk. Once upon the halberd he hooks his foot under the wooden pole and gives it a hard kick upwards, sending it at Kusari as a distraction. He then rushes her, swinging the axe in a downward angle at Kusari’s thigh.   Kusari moves to dodge the halberd, her agile form slinking past it. Pain suddenly explodes in Kusari's leg before in goes numb and crushed armor slides off. Her lips mouth an assortment of colorful words but she throws herself out of the way to avoid being hit yet again. One of the area's many stones provides enough support for the lady knight to pull herself up with a bit of a limp. Sweat trickles into Kusari's face and she wipes it away, watching Jardel through wary eyes. To attack him up close would be suicide with her useless leg and give him too much of an advantage. She throws her beloved longsword out of battle before pulling the weapon favored by her race. She places an arrow on the quiver quickly, ending the pause in action. The elf draws the bow and fires, but not only once. Years of obsessive training reveal themselves as numerous arrows take flight on a collision course with Jardel and the area around him should he try and dodge. Kusari stops wielding the ivory-handled, elven longsword in her right hand.  Jardel tightens his grip as he feels his battle-axe make contact, the handle vibrating as it ripes through flesh and armor. He watches her slink off and prepares to follow when he sees her unleash a hail of arrows. He drops the battle-axe and grabs at the shield on his back. Not being able to move as quick or as flexible as the elf he pulls out the shield as the first arrow digs into the plate armor on his chest. He swings the shield into position, but not before another arm sinks into his arm. He braces the large kite shield, allowing it to take the brunt of the assault of arrows. As soon as he is sure the attack has stopped he grasps the arrow in his chest and pulls it out with a moan. The bow that launched the arrow must have been a powerful one, undoubtedly crafted by elves. The arrow passed completely through his chain and plate armor, striking into his chest. He then pulls the arrow from his arm, a likewise situation. He draws out from a scabbard at his side a short broadsword. He quickly moves to the stone Kusari hides behind, the adrenaline pumping through him the only thing keeping him going. He slams the sword against the side of the stone, shooting sparks down on to the high grass around it. He continues past her and strikes another stone nearby, producing more sparks. He does this repeatedly, the sparks all quickly eat up the dry grass, allowing flames to surround Kusari. Jardel fills the meadow with fire, strategically lighting fires around the rocks forming a circle around Kusari. He backs off to watch what will happen.  Kusari panics thinking perhaps magic, the one thing she fears, was used. She limps forward to meet fire, behind her there is fire, everywhere! Fire! Kusari grabs her sword and bow as the flames close in around her. Her mind is fogged by fear. She braces herself, running blindly towards the area where the meadow meets the river. Her body is licked by flames and the smell of burnt flesh fills the air. On the moist ground she collapses, safe from the flames. She breathes a sigh of relief, but without fear to fuel her, she has not the energy to battle...
