Went to Phils to practice, and we did, sorta, untill evan and phil got drunk and kept on getting off beat. so we went to senate instead and ate.   Also got "...And Justice for all" by Metallica!! =)  Went home and they decided to go pioneering on hines, so i just stayed at home for i knew of the storms that were going to blow over. So now its actually storming, and im gonna go. later all.  mur
