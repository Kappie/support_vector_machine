It's not that I don't love my family, but they're driving me out of my mind.  If I could just have my independence, maybe things would get better.  Like today.  After school, I went to work on newspaper stuff for a little over an hour.  Well, I went out to my car, and wouldn't you know it, it wouldn't start.  I could have sworn it was because of the battery, which caused me to be stranded not even a week ago.  So, I was stuck at the school, I called my mother, I complained, then I sat and did pre-cal homework.  It sucked.  Then, it finally started before my dad could travel the 30 miles home from work to give me a jump start, and I went home, yelled, and now I've shut up for the rest of the evening.  I'm just so tired of being around my parents.  Honestly, the only one I really look forward to coming home to is my little dog, who seems to be going through some health issues right now.  I really hope he doesn't die now at the time when he's my only salvation in this house.  I'm just dissatisfied with things just because I guess I'm tired of being satisfied with them.  For some reason, I seem to be second-guessing  everything .  Are my friends my true, rock solid friends?  Do my teachers really want me to succeed?  Am I really going to be able to be somebody?  So many questions, a lifetime to answer them, yet it feels like the hours of my life are dripping wastefully down the drain...
