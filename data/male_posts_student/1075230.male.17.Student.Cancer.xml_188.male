Normally, I let this sort of thing pass, wash over me, cause I know that arguing would make things worse. But after being constantly told by people to argue and stuff, I did, tonight.    So, I tell my dad that I want to take the beginner's japanese class instead of the canto/mando whatever-the-hell he wants me to take. He tells me I can't master the language in one year, and that he wants to "complete learning" the other languages, and that he had no objections to me learning beginners japanese if I had "perfected" chinese. I said something about how saturday school isn't going to help me perfect it anyway. Then he became really pissed and stuff. Which leads me back to my original philosophy, don't argue against parents in subjects like these, because they're just going to be jerks and be stubborn about it, and moreover, they're going to get even more pissed cause I'm "talking back" to them.   Anyway, after that, I closed the door to my room so I can seethe in silence, the he came back for no (insert profanity here) reason, even more pissed off than before and saying "are you throwing a tantrum??". I'm like "no, I want some quiet so I can work". Then he got even angrier, and practically shouting "Who's making it so it's not quiet?" (oh, and remember I'm translating too, so it may be imprecise)... and I was thinking in my head "ummmm... i WONDER". But I said nothing. Then he was pointing at the computer, and said "what about that music?? you said you want quiet??", so i was like "music doesn't bother my concentration", and my dad shouted (by now he was like bursting - which i don't get why, cause I'm the one who loses in the end) "So I'M an annoyance to you???". I said "no...", course, in my mind, I was like "YES!! SO GET THE HELL OUT!!". After a while he left saying "the older you get, the more disobedient you get!!"   It's only a short version of the entire conversation, but trying to recall it fully and type it all out makes it worse than it is now. So yah, so much for debating and communicating. I'll keep this in mind if I ever have the remotest desire to talk to parents about anything.   ~Chronos (severely pissed off)
