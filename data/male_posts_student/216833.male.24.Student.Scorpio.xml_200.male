He is the biggest wad of crap I have found in California. Lemme describe him; he is a lanky 18 year old know-it-all that fucks up almost everything and can't COUNT worth shit. He sings random shit to customers and is just overall the most annoying person I have had the bad luck of meeting. I know the kid hates my guts - I have never been more of an ass hole to anyone in my life. I am a straight up dick to this kid. For instance, he was helping the new girl with the register when she was doing just fine on her own, so I walk over there and ask him if he was instructed to watch over her shoulder. Then I tell him to get back to work. AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He brings out things in me that I just can't cope with or handle well. Good riddance to him for a time. On a more organized note; I went to the DMV office to get mimi's car registered and our address' changed on the ol' drivers license. I could not work at the DMV - people are so insanely rude to the desk people. I am shocked at the nerve of some people.  Why can't we just be kind and generous to people - instead(me included) we are blindly led by selfishness.  You know, I have washed my hands with this senseless judgment of random people. It will give me nothing but more grief in the end. Every day is a good day for me, I am alive and my plans have not been ruined totally so screw all of these people and their bad days.  I want to share with you a poem that I came across while reading this book I bought. ----------------------------------------- Pine Tree Tops by Gary Snyder  in the blue night frost haze, the sky glows with the moon pine tree tops bend snow-blue, fade into sky, frost, starlight. the creak of boots. rabbit tracks, deer tracks, what do we know. -------------------------------------------- Man, I know the answer to that question. We don't know nearly what we all think we know about our surroundings. Take it all in, I think i might have to go off alone in the woods at the end of this week. Maybe do some meditation and find out where I ran off to.  I saw this stupid fucking bumper sticker today that said. "Except for Slavery, Fascism, Nazism, and Communism WHAT DOES WAR SOLVE"  Oh shit...   current mood:  good current music: The Mars Volta - Haunt of the Roulette Dares
