Probably due to my terrible sleeping position and getting my hand squashed under my body. Oh well, hope it heals soon. Either that, long enough for me to miss my performance on 6th December. I don't wanna perform without being able to practise.  YF for today was Bible Study and Student Ministry Time. The video did by Student Life Sub-commitee (the one I'm in) was quite funny. But turned out that some parts were able to impact certain people. And I did round up. Was quite nervous, but not that nervous actually for someone doing it the first time. Hope it was fine. After all, it's God's message and I didn't want to deliver it poorly. Maybe I would post it here sometime, so those who couldn't catch my words can read it for themselves.  I kind of miss people. Although I see this people rather often, but it just feels like you haven't really met them. Like you don't really talk with them and stuff. Well, my life kinda just surrounds going about doing things now. I think I'm happy. At least I'm less moody these days, not that I am often. But I do feel love and patient sometime. And it's great. It's great to do chores and feel happy about it. I guess a very delightful form of service is help. Being helpful and simple and makes you feel really light-hearted.  Oh well, I should go now. Should catch some sleep before some of the interesting happenings to take place the next day.
