Since he's so experienced at all this, I've decided to follow his lead.  I'll still try to think up sensical titles when I can, but otherwise, total randomness!  It's better than no title at all. Erin: Either one, since I know parodies are what you're best at.  I started a "Look Down" parody about Marvin, but it just wasn't working at all, so I've moved on. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
