It's about 12:45AM on Tuesday "morning"  and I'm about to hit the sack... bed.  How did Blogger manage to fuck up the two posts on "Saturday"?   So, here's Monday's post:  [MONDAY POST]Monday, ah... a start of another week of freedom.... Well, my last one until summer school starts.  I'll be taking Health. Four hours of health.. whoopdey damn do.  Well, my bathroom is done. It doesn't look too bad, either. I just need to build the shelf that will hang over my toilet.   Speaking of toilet, one word of advice: Never eat double fudge brownie icecream... EVER. Unless you have lots of patience and good magazines laying around.  -REB [END MONEY POST]  There you have it folks. Two days of posting in ONE post. Hope you enjoyed it.  -reb
