Man, I really want my post back, I'm tempted to rewrite it, but I really need to sleep more regularly, aahhhaahaahaa!!! τι να κάννω!!! (what should I do!!!) I don't really want to rewrite it, but I want what I said to be posted. This is lame, and all I can think about now is pick up lines... well ill leave with this: there are two fish in a tank, one says to the other "how do you drive this thing?"
