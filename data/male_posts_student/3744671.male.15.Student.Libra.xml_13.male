There's no doubt that if you're into this genre, you will love this movie, and appreciate it more than someone who isn't. For me, I am borderline on these films, I like them, but they certainly aren't my favourite type of movie.   I still enjoyed it though, good acting, nice special effects. Overall, nothing that will revolutionize or define the genre, but it's one of the best disaster films I've seen in a long time.   It's more of a great way to spend an evening, so unless you dig this type of film, I would say give it a rental when it comes out and that should satisfy viewers like me.    Rating:  3.5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
