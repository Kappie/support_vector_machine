I got stuck in an all-girl team (bar me, of course). And one of them was my sister. And I was supposed to be leader. Can I please ask someone what chance I stood of getting them to do anything I wanted? We did end up going roughly the direction I wanted to travel, but that was just about how far they listened to me. But I was amazed, greens actually are very good camouflage. My team kept disappearing and reappearing as they moved in the dark. Very cool. Wasn't half glad of the shower I had afterwards though.  I got a letter from Pizza Hut this morning saying that I didn't get a job there. This is fair enough. It may even have something to do with it being Friday the 13th. But I'm enraged about the fact they sent it a full two weeks after the interview, nearly a month after I applied! I needed a summer job, and thanks to the cunts there, I now have under a month of holiday left to find another job! Looks like I'll be pushing trolleys around B&Q from the looks of things. Cheers Pizza Hut, you've made my summer.
