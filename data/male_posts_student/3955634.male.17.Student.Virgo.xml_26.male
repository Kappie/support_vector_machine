A resident of Maryland, Keyes will be moving to his new home state by the November 2nd election, as Illinois law dictates.  urlLink Follow this as it unfolds . Keyes is going to be running against the almost unstoppable force of  urlLink Barack Obama , State Senator and charisma-giant.  urlLink His speech  at the Democratic Convention was one of the finest I've ever seen -- you can  urlLink watch it here  if you'd like.  My thoughts? Nice try, GOP.. the bigwigs in the party figure "Hey, people like Obama because he's black, right?" and so they put up their own black political figure in opposition. Sorry guys, it's not that easy. Obama is one of the most charismatic and energetic up-and-comers in the game. Even Tucker Carlson has called this one in favor of Obama, and I'd put a link to that comment, but it was a confession he made on Crossfire yesterday. I swear!  ADDENDUM: Okay, that wasn't quite right. He's been  invited  to run for the Senate under GOP endorsement. Still counting on it though.
