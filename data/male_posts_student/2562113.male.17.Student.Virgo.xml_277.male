There were no weekends where you just chilled with a group of 30 people from your class at someone's house and had a good time. You couldn't walk through the halls of NRHS and genuinely say "Hello" to all the familiar faces. Not once during graduation did I stop and think, "Damn...this is the last time we're all going to be together in one group ever again. I'm going to miss this class." I don't even look forward to seeing everyone from my class 30 years from now at a high school reunion. There was no sense of unity with the Class Of 2003!  Now this year's graduating class has such a great sense of unity. You're probably one of the tightest classes to walk through the doors of NRHS in a long time. Most of my friends consist of people from the Class of '04. Hell, I wish I'd been born a year younger so I could have graduated with you guys.  I only keep in touch with about 6 or 7 people from my class and sometimes I wish that number was more like 20 or 30. My best advice to the soon-to-be graduates is to keep in touch with each other and not let this awesome class just fall apart after everyone scatters into college at the end of the summer. You now have a golden opportunity to make life-long friends, why let that opportunity go to waste?  Last but not least......CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!
