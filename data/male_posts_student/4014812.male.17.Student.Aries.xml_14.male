It started off by me waking up.. and getting a call from Ashley. She said they her and Steph were gonna be coming to my house for some visiting at like 11 or something so i said ok to that.  Around 11 they showed up and pretty much looked at my year book for a while. Steph signed it for some reason... even though she doesnt even goto my school. After that they both left leaveing their drinks behind. MESSY GIRLS!!! Like an hour after that James showed up and he watched me play Vice City for a while until Wes and Bret got here. After Wes and Bret got here we left for downtown.  As we were waiting for the bus to show up, we kept commenting on James new lover, "The Wunderbar"... dont ask... its an odd and stoopid story. lol anyway, when the bus got there we noticed that Ashley and Steph were on the bus cuz they missed their stop somewhere in Comox to go see Steven. So we talked to them for a while.. or i should say they talked to us for the bus ride. At the post office this guy came on the bus. We was pretty cool, we taked to him for a bit after they got off the bus about Steph's abnormal BEAUTY, and how annoying Ashley is sometimes lol.  After that we were at the mall and we got off and headed over to Future Shop. James bought this anime DVD thing about some thing... dont really care cuz i dont watch that type of anime lol. Wes bought Spaceballs and Rise of Nations the expansion. Bret bought.. a pop... i bought... a pop. lol after that we headed to Walmart and we bought nothing. After all that we ran to catch the bus back to the bottom of Ryan hill.  Here we stopped at Blockbuster and i rented this game called BUJINGAI.. or something like that, its a game like Devil May Cry. Then we went over to Superstore and Wes bought another 2 games. He bought Megaman Zero2 and Tales of Symphonia. Both of which arent really that good of games but whatever floats your boat Wes. After that we caught the bus home and watched Spaceballs.. FUNNY MOVIE.. CUZ ITS SO STUPID IN MANY A WAYS.  lol.... after the movie was over everyone left. At like 7 we played warcraft 3 until about 10:30. Then i downloaded some porn... watched that for a while... got bored with it.. and decided to update my blog. As i was updating my blog i was talking to Audra and Steph... Audra i didnt really have much to say too because she doesnt exactly create conversation, and i hate trying to start a convo when the other person doesnt say anything lol. As for the convo with Steph... that was pretty much just about her boobs lol... And how i adore them so :D.  lol i think ive written enough for today... ima go sleep now or something... possibly shoot myself
