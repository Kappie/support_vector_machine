It seems that when im out with my schoolmates, im having a good time and not "getting frustrated" or "thinking too much" or even thinking at all. When im not out with my schoolmates, however, i start thinking about  why  im not, which if you ask me, is really,  really , annoying. Therefore, thinking is the devil.  i hate to rag on people (mainly because i hate people that rag on other people), so i normally keep it to myself. however im going to flush out my mind and speak my fury. It is frustrating when you hear stories where people call up their friends for a gathering, and then tell them to keep mum about it as to not invite the entire school over (that is how Holland Hall works, unfortunately). although im fine with that, it is annoying when you consider the person who is calling his/her mates your friend, and you end up not recieving a phone call, but then hear about the gathering from another person that had been notified. I realize there is nothing personal involved, but man, is it frustrating. these type of incidents throw me into thought, and have me questioning the authenticity of my "friends" once again, which i hate to do. the cycle never ends...  ah well, such is life. if you've read through my entire rant, i give you props. if you happen to recognize the "story" above, please dont hate me, i just need some release. now im off to study for the SAT of doom this sat-ur-day.   P.S. thanks for the words of advice stephanie. ur blog was the inspiration for mine ^_^
