Usually HP stands for "Horrid Picture" but I've been pleasantly surprised how well it has performed so far. I picked up the dock so it's a very sexy little package.  Dave sent me a link to a program called Hello - it's sort of an instant messenger designed to share pictures - very sleek setup. I like it.  Finally I picked up a gmail account. graham.williams at the old gmail.communism. Feel free to drop me a line. I've got a fucking GIG of storage to burn through.
