Seems strange for me to have woken up so early....oh wait, no...I just stayed up all night!  This ain't my first time though, so I think I'll be able to make it through today.  Hope I don't conk out durin' class or somethin', but that wouldn't be such a bad idea.  Anyway, not much to speak about now since I havta go and get my stuff ready.  You can expect a blog from me this afternoon or later tonight.  Anyway, I'm fuckin' tired, so I can't predict how my day will go today.  I can say that I'm not a mornin' person, where's my coffee...where's my blanket...aww fuck, I'm goin' to bed.  Oh yeah...More to come...!
