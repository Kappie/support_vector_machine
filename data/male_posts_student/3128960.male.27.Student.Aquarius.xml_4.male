Yesterday I had a similar experience; it was, unfortunately, much less inspired by the divine. Rather than a direct communique from the Almighty, my pre-articulated insight was conveyed via The Economist Technology Quarterly (March 13th, 04, p. 18). Further, it did nothing to strengthen my faith. If anything, it did quite the opposite.   Previous to doing my "duty" yesterday night, I had high hopes for my blogging enterprise. To the question, "Will blogging--the practice of maintaining an online diary, or weblog--revolutionize journalism?", I would have answered with a resounding "IT SHALL." To the inquiry, "Do the world's bloggers really constitute a 'second superpower', the only force on earth capable of keeping America's neo-imperialist government in check?", I would have resounded "Friends, Comrades, step with me onto this new Shining Path, for it is We who shall prevail!"   Well, apparently, the question we should all really be asking is: "Or is the blogging craze just an example of sound and fury signifying nothing--a re-run of the late 1990's fad for personal websites, only with easier to use publishing software?" Apparently it is. Why? Simply put, "while bloggers--half of whom are teenagers--are convinced they are changing the world, not everyone agrees. There are even some people beyond the insular world of the "blogosphere" who have not ever heard of blogging at all." All is for naught it seems.  Yet one must wonder...Is it mere coincidence that this article made its way into my hands a mere 3 days after my initial foray into  blogging? If I hadn't read somewhere that Martin Luther took divine dooks I would be inclined to say yes. But, as the Pot seems to be the Purveyor of the Divine Truth, now I am not so sure. According to Gee-Dubbya, everyone has a god-given penchant for neo-imperialism. Therefore, all blogging that attempts to thwart this effort is uncharitable, and, let's face it, straight up sinnin'. Perhaps I have simply been set on the true path--a path that shines not with revolutionary fervor but with the grace of the Almighty who calls for a free world and a safe America.   So i reiterate, in the the end, all our rants and raves, our sound and our fury, signify and accomplish nothing. But this is ok, it is as it should be. The revolution is not forthcoming, because it has been, is, and will be televised. So just sit back and watch. Then write some vacuous, pubescent thoughts for no reason. If I didn't convince you, go do(x2) your duty as an American and discover the revelation that awaits you. One tip...make sure the toilet paper isn't all used up. Thanks Arik.  More on my growing distaste for empty revolutionary rhetoric, blogs or otherwise, later...
