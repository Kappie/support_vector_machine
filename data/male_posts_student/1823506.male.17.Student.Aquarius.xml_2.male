It was very corrupt, and people were buying black market police badges so they could clear customs more quickly. I was walking from the airport (presumably to my new house), and we passed several schools. A normal public school, a private school, and a "School for Canadians". This one was on the edge of a beautiful lake, in some sort of Canadians only embassy. Lots of barbed wire.
