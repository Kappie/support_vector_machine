Anywho, the person who sings the theme song, Gavin DeGraw, appeared in a musical performance on last night's episode in the end cafe scene (It was open mic night).  Well, I really liked the song he sang so I downloaded it (I am listening to it right now). I also visited his website. Now for the IRONY.  He is on tour, and tonite, January 21, 2004, the day I practically discover him, Gavin is in PITTSBURGH!  Talk about IRONY.  And to further add to the MADNESS!, my secret crush also like One Tree Hill.  Wow! That is SO Ironic.
