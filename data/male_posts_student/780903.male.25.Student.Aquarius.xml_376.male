You want words? I'll fake it I didn't hear students Say it Take all your doctrine Forget it  Feels like we've been here a while  Your lecture is a slumberland Your lecture is a slumberland (My laptop's off) Your lecture is a slumberland  Damn casebooks You frustrate me And then you talk you talk you talk Maybe I shouldn't take a Sudafed  Your lecture is a slumberland Your lecture is a slumberland (My laptop's off) Your lecture is a slumberland Your lecture is a slumberland
