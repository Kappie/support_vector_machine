Kaito U.K.   "Band Red" Bishop Allen  "Charm School" the Joggers  "Solid Guild" Natural History  "Beat Beat Heartbeat" the Unicorns  "Who will cut our hair when we're gone" the Darkness  "Permission to Land" Ted Leo and the Pharmacists  "Hearts of Oak" Monkeytown  "Death of Monkeytown" Spoon  "Kill the Moonlight" Canoe  "I Give You...Canoe" VA  "Pop Pop Pigalle"  All of these are good, so you should listen to them.
