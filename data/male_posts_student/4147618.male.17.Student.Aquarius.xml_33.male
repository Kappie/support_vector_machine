I wish this month goes quickly and smoothly (thats what I have been saying for the last seven months) :-)  The ninth month is going to be a little tough and also scary.  Its Scary because I will be leaving my outside life behind for my baby for at least a year if everything works out, which I dont really mind staying home but still I dont want to miss out on anything. Right now staying home is like sooooooo quiet, looking for work to do around the house, or just watch TV.  Later it will be baby this baby that, baby crying, cleaning baby all the time, feeding, cleaning again...hehe.  I hope my baby is NOT picky in eating.  I dont want to run around the room later to feed her, she should just wait for me to bring her food and finish everything (I guess this is too much to ask from a baby) :)  I hope our baby is chubby baby, I have a little competition going on at work from all the people I know who already had their baby.  I want mine to be the fattest and of course CUTEST, which shouldn't be a problem because her mom is soooooo cute herself..hehe !!!  I know some people will AGREE to that....rite dharmesh???!!! (good)  Well thats about it..will rite more when I have more to share.  Mommy Dearest!
