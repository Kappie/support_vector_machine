The Vandals are playing the 5th... I haven't seen them in a while, so I wouldn't mind seeing them. Especially since I now know the Fiend Fest is $32. Fuck that... Warped has more and better bands and it's $20. The problem is that Warped is in the middle of the week that we might be going to Vegas. Can my body handle that much fun?  ***
