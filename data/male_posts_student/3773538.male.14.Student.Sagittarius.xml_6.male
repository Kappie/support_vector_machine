I desperately need to concentrate on my studies. Ok, I'll cut this message short. Our class finally got an 'A' grade for cleanliness!! Yipee!! Hopefully, this standard can continue till we  are allowed to get a class t-shirt. Ok...gotta go now...Study hard you peeps!! Don't spend too much time online!!!!
