I cannot pursue much of anything with a lag like this.  Heck i can barely "pursue" my own email or write these pathetic blogs for people that do not care.  Butt seriously, adsl should be for all the masses to enjoy.  With the advent of the EU UN and NATO all the countries are uniting.  All the people are identified.  Everyone is watched so why the heck can't they just fudge it all over and smooth out the internet.  Because they are evil trolls.  Do you understand.  It's as if the internet were run by a horde of especially harsh accountants and marketers.  The Marketers rope you in and force you to buy their product.  ie. pop ups and free dinners at chilis.  Accountants have all the evil tendencies. ie. pages you cannot close and "page cannot be displayed".  simply put if you take  ACCOUNTANTS+MARKETERS=THE TROLLS THAT STOCK THE INTERNET That is my bogus theorum for tonight.  I am tire and you don't car good night.
