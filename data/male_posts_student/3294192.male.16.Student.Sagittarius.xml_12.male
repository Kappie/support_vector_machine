It has lead to some very good playlists though.   Recently, Breaker! Breaker! The Epoxies Erase Errata The Do Nothing Machine The Breeders Les Savy Fav Pavement The Moving Units The Postal Service  The woman in  urlLink Breaker! Breaker!  has the nicest voice. It makes her sound so cunning and intelligent. If only all girls could get so deep under my skin just by talking. They are the few treasures. I guess it's the price she pays for  urlLink looking so cool .  Those thoughts lead me to write a song, about robots. Hopefully, it can be the lyrics to Summons.  "I'm a machine. I run from rust. Robots get hot from friction not from love. Now summer shows up, humidity. I know it's bad, electricity. Robots get hot from friction not from love. Now summer shows up, and it's barren of, Robots that run and robots that jump, and you."  I guess it's about stigma. The robot knows that humidity can fuck up his circuits, so he's going to stay inside and alone over the summer. He feels that occurences in his life only revolve around maintaining himself. So he worries about friction and discards oppritunites for love, while a girl stays home because there are no robots to run or jump with.   urlLink iTunes  has really given me good opportunities to get my rock on. It makes the construction of playlists painless enough that I have started regularly using them in conjunction with my favorite iPod, which despite my previous grievances, has yet to show any severe signs of an aging battery. iTunes have a very smooth mesh with the Apple Music store, which I am starting to consider more and more reputable. Maybe I'll stop borrowing music. Maybe I'll put away my pirate flag and eyepatch. Maybe I'll even uninstall  urlLink WinMX . FUCK NO, what else is a cable modem good for?
