Oh yeah, We got first place at the parade last week. We beat our archenemy, Wellsville. Still undefeated muahahahaha. Raining out today, that really blows. I can’t go to the carnival tonight. I am going to go tomorrow instead. The concert last night was great. I had a lot of fun. The trumpet where hitting the high notes. They sounded pretty sweet if I do say so my self. Got to go read my manga. Maybe I will post a yaoi pic later.TTYl
