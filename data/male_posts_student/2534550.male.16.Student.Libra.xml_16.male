I found a Styrofoam cup with  Chelsea AKA West Coast Tease  emblazoned across it in teal blue Sharpie. A pair of shorts, sunscreen, a tuner, and the last nine pages of drill completed the ensemble.   I unrolled the drill sheets, and the memories came flooding back as I was bombarded by the strong scent of Banana Boat SPORT (SPF 30+). The pages were cold, and almost damp, just as I left them after the last day of drill learning. In the summer, the sunscreen flavor IS your perfume, your cologne, only to be enhanced by the sickly sweet smell of perspiration.   Staring at the dots on the page, my eyes automatically sought out T3, my dot of honor: Daphne- T1/2, Jeff- T4, Austin- T5, Alex- T6, Travis- T7, Marco-T8, Brookie-T10, Taryn- T11, and Johnny-T12. We killed T9...  It's amazing to think how different my summer would have been if I hadn't marched between those two specific leads. Daphne mentored me in the big sister type way I've always dreamed of. She encouraged me, and molded me into the confident player I am now. She's better than I am, and I was able to compete with her on easy terms, battling it out for the solo, and laughing together when one of us would botch a note. Jeff was a different story. Though we fixed things by the end of the season, I really had to restrain myself from flat out bitching at him. In marching band the precious season, I was section leader, and yelled at whoever annoyed the crap out of me. But, Jeff was a lead, and I was just a rookie as well, so I was in no place to put him in his. Tolerance is a wonderful thing.  In the horn arc, I still did my ripples immediately after Daphne, and Travis followed suit on my left. Austin was after Travis, then Jessika with a K. It wasn't until I started vying for the solo that I stood next to Daphne. Before that, I stood between my two brothers in the best section alive, the 2nd trumpet section. That's where Austin and I giggled together as we hung our heads over and buzzed our chops, and made the bond that will keep us marching together forever. Once we moved outside, I moved next to Daphne, and played next to her the rest of the season. I specifically remember one sweaty, sunscreen soaked hug towards the end of the season with her, wrapping my arms around this tiny screamer, and never having more respect for any other horn player.  My squeeze bottle of Banana Boat is grimy, coated with dirt and valve oil and Gatorade and sweat and the sunscreen itself. I should recoil from the filth, wash the bottle in the sink, and put it in the cabinet for the rest of my family to use. But, you know I wont. This is my bottle of creamy cancer vaccine. The same methodology applies to my Bus Box of Death. The duct tape security system with a list of tour accidents is still there, guarding two 7C mouthpieces, a first aid kit safely secured in a cashew tin, Arrid XX (24 hour protection), and a blue handheld fan that spews the smell of mints and Bugles when its foam blades are engaged. Remember how I'd always run around the bus searching for hair ties because my hair was always down before shows, on the rare chance one of my parking lot victims would see me during visual warm-ups, and my hair bands were conveniently left in the Bus Box next to my Aerobed in the Gym?  Now is the best time for me to compile my thoughts into a coherent essay, as the 2004 season will be officially underway in less than 62 hours. Austin, I need to pee, but I can't go until I finish this. I'm ready to climb into my sleeping bag, sleeping on my stomach with Dashboard Confessional coming through my headphones so I wont snore and wake up the entire corps. I'm ready to run until I collapse, I swear this year I'll never give up. I'm ready to do  side, back, side, front  until my calves feel as if they're going to drop off. I'm ready to hang my head below my knees, buzzing my chops, only preventing myself from looking like an idiot because the rest of the hornline is doing it too. I'm ready to see Brookie, and Omid and Victor again, and see how the old friends fit in with the rookies.   I'm ready to march.
