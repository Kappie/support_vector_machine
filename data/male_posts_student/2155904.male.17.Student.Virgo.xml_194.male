Tyke has been going to school without even thinking about graduating for about 13-14 years now and it has just begun to sink in that he is graduating.  While he was driving up to Cougar Mountain today he really thought about it when he saw another car.  He doesn't remember now what it was about the car that made him realize it but he did notice it.  But that wasn't the first event of Tyke's day so he better back up for a second.  Tyke woke up a little pooped but he didn't think that he should just sit in bed and sleep so he got out and came online.  Maniak got a basketball game going so Tyke decided to join in.  Dr. Phil, Amed, K-caj, Fejj, and Macaroon all joined the boys in their game.  Tyke certainly wasn't playing very well.  After the game he came home and really didn't do anything productive for the rest of the day.  He saw his mom only once and that was for dinner because she is laid up in bed with what is most likely strep throat.  And folks, strep throat sucks.  If you had forgotten, Tyke has had it at least 2wice and it is just sooo uncomfortable until you get the antibiotics.  But that still takes a littl while.  Well after Tyke's BBQ'd steak, baked potato, and caesar salad he got ready for Refuge (put on shoes) and waited for Dotti to pick him up.  Refuge is winding down now.  Although Tyke hasn't been to it all that much he does like it and it's too bad he won't get to after this year.  But it certainly has opened Tyke up and the social aspect of it isn't too shabby either, ;).  Tyke and Ekul sat next to each other and commented on how the one song was played like 5 different times.  It must have been a 15-20 minute song.  It was funny.  But anyway, Dotti drove Tyke home and he got some ice cream and a cookie and got back online but nobody stayed on so he has just been blogging for a little while.  And watching Harry Potter cuz it's on ABC. Although he does have the movie as well, but that's ok.  This week shouldn't be too bad.  Wednesday is the AP Gov test and other than that he just has to think about Physics and sorta Math.  But English should be a snap.  With Senyohl ya never know though.  Let's just hope that Tyke gets go somewhere he wants to go.
