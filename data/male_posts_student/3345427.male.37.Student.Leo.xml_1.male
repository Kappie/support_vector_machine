Many years ago after 9-11, I worked on her Oprah's Live Message Board, and I began to write. So, many years later I've learned many things and seen some wonderful places. I moved to Montreal from Miami after 34 years of living in the Sunshine State. But ya know, I never went to the beach. And I lived on the beach. WHO KNEW??? So Now I'm a Canadian, Living in Montreal.   I am 2 years and 5 months Clean and Sober for the second time in my life, and I am also HIV positive now 12 years...WHOA WHO KNEW ??? I am a test pig for Doctors at the Montreal General Hospital, and I am in TIP TOP Shape. I've never felt better in my life.   You see I pulled a geographic at 4 months sober to a foreign country no less, I got my citizenship cause my mother is Canadian, so I claimed birthright, EH? I worked at maintaining sobriety. I met my partner in a "meeting" and we've been together ever since that day. We are going to be married this Fall. In the Spring of 2003, my aftercare counselor asked me one day, "Jeremy, you've climbed a tall mountain, NOW what are you going to do for YOU?" So after some thought, I decided to go back to University after a 16 year hiatus, at age 36. You see I lived, so while the getting is good, why not? I have it all today and I do not complain.   In April of 2004 I completed my first year at Concordia University Majoring in Religion. and I could not be more amazed at how I accomplished this last year, I still don't know. I lived every day as it came, never expecting anything, just walked my path, one foot in front of the other. And Here I am.   You see writing every day is good. you see me for who I am. Honest, vulnerable, happy or sad, and sometimes downright INSANE. I've been writing every day since Oprah got me started when the GET REAL challenge began in the fall of 2001.   I was a drunk, living a miserable life in Miami Beach, but every day I watched Oprah, and one day she spoke to me. I was still drinking after 9-11, but over a few months and divine intervention Oprah helped me get sober. That day was December 9th 2001. The day I picked up that "white chip." I've written her before, alas, no "Oprah Moment" for me YET !!!! I have hope ya know.   So this journal will adress the many things goig on in my life, and I will seek answers to questions that i may have at the time i write. I will share some anecdotes along the way and yes, I may get upset at times too eh? but that's the nature of staying clean and sober. enjoy...   peace Jeremy
