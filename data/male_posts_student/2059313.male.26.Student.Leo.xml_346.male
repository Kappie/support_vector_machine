I kept it pretty simple so that I had some basis to go off of for next time I make it... so it wasn't too hot... just hot enough.  It actually could've been a little bit spicier.  But it tasted great, and it turns out that it can be made pretty quickly, too.  (took me about 45 minutes, but that's because I didn't exactly know what I was doing, plus I made cornbread and waited for that to be done).  I actually made it with ground turkey instead of ground beef, and it was great.  I can't wait to make some again sometime!  I would like to thank the following people for introducing me to - and encouraging my love for - chili...  Jon Adams Erin Adams Amber Henry  That is all. Thank you.
