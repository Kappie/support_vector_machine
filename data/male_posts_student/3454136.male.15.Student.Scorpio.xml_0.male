If u've read my main blog, u'd no, cleaning, like all other chores, is now up to me... I'll have to get up tommorow and vacuum. To make it fun, I play to do a little pretending while vacuuming.  I'm brain-sucking alien from the planet Vacuumius. I've come to Earth and with earthly vacuums as my weapons, I'm gonna suck the brains out of those puny bugs in the carpet. Hahahahaha.
