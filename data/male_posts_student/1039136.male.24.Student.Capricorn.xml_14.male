Hmm...Reality...everyone loves to watch everyone else's "real life" on tv to remind them deep down how much their life sucks. No doubt though, reality TV is pop...Shows have arisen about families in real life, such as the Osbournes..Fat girls eating real life, such as the Anna Nicole show, there are "real life shows" that cover the genres of dating, becoming a star, and surviving in the middle of nowhere for a period of time.  As of last year, Musicless T V, introduced a new flavor into the realm of "reality tv", Greek Life.  Now, we've all heard about or seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and we know(or at least we SHOULD KNOW) that Greek life and Greek weddings have only one thing in common, the alphabet.  But regardless...GREEK HAS GONE POP. MTv introduced its first peek into greek life last year upon its showing of "Sorority Life".  Many criticisms of the show have called the first season of this life watered down and I agree.  The show picked a tame sorority.  The girls were very goody goody, and the pledges that weren't, were looked down upon by the sisters of whatever sigma something something pi.  We as the public didnt get to see girls swallow goldfish, or kiss each other, or even run around campus naked with "SLUT" written on their foreheads.  Have no fear though, based on commercials, MTv is ready to correct their mistakes from last season, with Sorority Life 2 and its new series, Fraternity Life.  These kids look CRAZY..just like most greeks.  Will this give  greeks a bad name? Fuck yeah...with their parents maybe, but who cares? They'll get over it.  The general public will finally get a look at why its good to be greek.  The older people will get to see what they missed back in the day when they were too big of pussies to become a pledge, and the younger crowd will be more drawn to Greek life as a result.  Everyone wins;well maybe except for the the greek chapters put into perspective.  Many Greek organizations have laws set in place against certain likely greek activities such as hazing, alcohol consumption, drug use, and bestiality, no wait..that last one goes hand in hand with rednecks, not greeks...my bad.  These exploited chapters may very well not be chapters after the shows air, but hell, at least they made it to Tv.  They sold their souls to go pop.  Nothing wrong with that, Publicity is publicity, and in the long run, publicity is money.  Speaking of money, Hollywood is cashing in on Greek Life, and the only thing big and fat about this wedding with a greek fraternity to comedy will be Will Ferrell's wallet.  Since Greek has gone pop, this movie is a surefire hit. The movie will pull in every "greek" to the theaters for sure, along with the inquisitive, and the usual movie goers: those who like comedies, those who like Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Craig Kilborn, Juliette Lewis, Andy Dick, Seann William Scott..ok you get the point, lots of stars..lots of laughs, this movie is going to be money, and it doesnt even know it.  I'm in a fraternity, and i'm going to see the movie no doubt because it will be a good laugh, and if its not, i'll take it out on the pledges(kidding....maybe). Well speaking of fraternities, tonight is Initiation Night for our new members, pledge class, whatever you want to call them. This is the kickoff for a 6 week period in which our new guys do various activities to work their way into the fraternity and get acquainted with everything and bla bla bla.  Now obviously I cant possibly expose anything we do to the public as i'm bound by contract and fraternal bond to keep my fucking mouth shut, but if its drunken exploits you want, i'll try to give that to you.  BUT cough cough ahem..greek life is NOT all about partying...its also about doing well in school.  As academics chair of my fraternity, i'm here to promote studying hard, trading the beer for books, and getting A's. :) :)  Now with that out of the way, beer is good . Not because it necessarily tastes good, but because it has alcohol in it. Parties are good, and not necessarily because they have alcohol at them, but because they have girls drinking alcohol at them. I'm going to make an effort to let you in on  Greek Life here at ESU, and my life in general, because thats what you all want. I've always said controversy breeds interest.  Writing  these sorts of journal entries are extremely difficult because when you choose to open up your life, personal or public, to the world, it's possible many people will disagree with you, some will hate you, but EVERYONE will judge you.      It's important whenr reading entries of this type, to keep an open mind, after all it is a privlege to have a look into someone else's life.  If I do decide to write details about my life and you have a problem, comment, or compliment with what i wrote, hey, thats fine, email me ( jms504@juno.com).  In most cases I will post your email along with a response on this journal.  Happy reading. Congrats To Zeta Beta Tau Zeta PI Alpha Epsillon Class. Condom and a necktie.  Just a leadup into today's sound..i've decided to STOP being nice to those who don't merit it...So FUCK OFF...you piss me off, you're fucked..enough said.  Twisted Sister - We're Not Gonna Take It  Oh we're not gonna take it  No, we ain't gonna take it  Oh we're not gonna take it anymore   We've got the right to choose it  There ain't no way we'll lose it  This is our life, this is our song  We'll fight the powers that be just  Don't pick our destiny 'cause  You don't know us, you don't belong  Oh you're so condescending  Your gall is neverending  We don't want nothin', not a thing from you   Your life is trite and jaded  Boring and confiscated  If that's your best, your best won't do  We're right  We're free  We'll fight  You'll see  Oh we're not gonna take it  No, we ain't gonna take it  Oh we're not gonna take it anymore  Just you try and make us  We're not gonna take it  Come on!  No, we ain't gonna take it  You're all worthless and weak  We're not gonna take it anymore  Now drop and give me twenty  We're not gonna take it  Oh crinch pin  No, we ain't gonna take it  Oh you and your uniform  We're not gonna take it anymore
