Considering the low budget that the library committee probably had, I must say that they made quite a big effort to turn the library into a haunted kinda place, but the things that really freaked me out were the portraits of the country's past ministers that still lined the walls of the library.   I was so hyped up by this library week thingy that I started running around and jumping like I was on sugar 24/7. Even my friends noticed it. Me is nutty!   And it turne out that my internet friend is alright after all and that she was away at yet another camp. However, my hatred for human traffickers still burns.   In the papers today, I read an article about the middle-eastern countries. Restrictions on women entering some countries aren't so much based on religious rules; it is plainly because human trafficking is a shit helluva big problem there.   Another fascinating fact in the papers; Scratch this. 200+ people have died so far due to riots in the Phillipines. And a bad thing is that these are only the deaths that have been accounted for. Tsk.,tsk. All for the sake of electing a new leader. How beastly we humans are, not to mention Malaysia's crime rate which, in my opinion, is almost equivalent to that of a war-torn country. I think that Vietnam's crime rate might even be lower.  On the beheading of American captives by the Al-Qaida in the middle-east; it is a barbaric act, a true act of war. So far, the body count of beheaded Americans due to the current turbulence of power in the middle-east is still outnumbered and factually overshadowed by such gruesome historical periods such as the Spanish inquisition.    One thing that these two periods have in common is the obsession with power and balance. If only human beings can learn to be simple people, then only will there be peace. However, as I have always said, we are humans; tools of war.    I totally detest the beheadings though, but it is war. Things like that happen; people are shot, stabbed, beheaded, blown-up and stampeded on, etc...   People killing/ people dying/ children hurt and leaving crying/ if you practice what you preach/ why do you turn the other cheek?/ Father, father, father, help us/ send some guidance from above/ cuz' people got me/ got me/ questioning: Where is the love?   -	The Black Eyed Peas: Where is the Love?
