Always following the same path, over and over again. I suppose one could suggest that it's human nature to become accustomed to our routines, locked into them for large spans of time.  I get sick of it, of course, just as any human being becomes irritated by repetition and monotony. The question I suppose I need to ask is how I always end up like this in the end.  It's nice to break the cycle every so often, but it's easier to just accept it. It's always easier to do nothing than it is to even consider doing something. It's always best to take the path of least resistance.  I just need a break. But I'll get to it later.  When I feel like it.
