Mostly to keep in Michelle, cos she's such a funny, dirty slapper, and trying my damndest to get rid of the *knob* that is Jason. ARGH, he's so, so nasty and old-mannish. God knows why he came second, betaing the average Shell, cool and funny Stuart and damn funny Dan. Tom reckons it's the scottish people voting. And it happened last year with Cameron (from somewhere in Scotland) who won. Anyway, Nadia's win ensured that at least some of my money wasn't lost, seeing as I voted for her like 6 times. And she got all spastic with emotion, which was sweet. So happy!   Ooh - and did no-one else notice Davina crying? methinks she is faking it, I don't know.      Nadia  won!       Sam      Currently listening to: Usher - Burn. Mneh, its on tv, and I can't be arsed to turn it off...
