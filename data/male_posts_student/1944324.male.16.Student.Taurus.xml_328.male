Even though I only sat through two episodes of Sports Night. And wasn't really paying attention to them, but rather to the journal of Anakin Skywalker, which was, well... wizard.  And let me be the first person to annoy Michael and say...  "Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago TORONTO!"   But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!
