One thing there is to comment on; I started In-Car Monday (yesterday-feels longer ago than that).  It pretty fun. Yesterday I drove a Honda Civic, nice car but I don't like it that much. Today I drove the Ford Focus and I like it a lot. Tomorrow I'll try and get the sentra, and I guess sometime I'll drive the Malibu.  I hope to drive the Martix, its looks like a prett nice car.  Today we did S's through cones and that was fun, especially with the rain and big puddle.  Wow, I could have my lisence as soon as a week from tomorrow! Thats crazyness...  Other than that I really haven't done much, I go downtown with my mom in the mornings cause she works at Schlow Library and my sisters can't take me in during the day usually.  Yesterday I went to a bunch of different bussinesses and got applications.  I'm hoping to get a job at Music Mart cause that would just be an awesome kind of place to work... Help people look at instruments all day... sounds great to me. Today, I worked on my resume and then wandered around downtown until about 1 when I headed over to the school for In-Car (1:30 each day).  I saw Miss Pangborn again today... HaHa she's pretty funny and I'm not even sure why.  It must be pretty nice having the summer off like us kids.    Well thats all for now, I'm going to post some pictures. I'll be selling AWESOME Duck Tape Stuff at the Arts Fest this year... Come out and buy some great cheap stuff... July 7th 10 to 3.  If you come early enough you can give me an order that will be done by the end of the day.  Until later then...  -Dan V
