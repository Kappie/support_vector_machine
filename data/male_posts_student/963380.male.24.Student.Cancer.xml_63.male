I've been happier in my life, but that involved four pounds of chocolate, Alex Trebek, a skein of yarn, a ball of twine and some souvlaki. It's always nice to see people you've missed for *four* years - it's even better when they're happy to see you. Happy happy happy happy happy.  Brad called me tonight. Of course, it was not just a phone call, it was tech support.  I met the rudest woman in the world today. Leanne Carter of Kitchener. Bitched at me cause I wasn't replacing her notebook fast enough. Well guess what bitch? I know where you live, what classes you take and the fact that your resume sucks ass. Note to people bringing computers in to techinicians. You really need to think about being a fucking wang biter before you bring that in. After is fine. Before means I could decide to fuck you just about anyway I please.  And I did.  Bitch.
