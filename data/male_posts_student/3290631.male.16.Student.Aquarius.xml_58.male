It's a daunting task because I've changed so much over these past ten months.  After leaving Fieldston I was a complete wreck, worse than I was while  at  the damn school.  During the summer I was better able to come out of the depression and look for new things in my life to fill in for things I didn't want or had lost.  But, essentially, I was still holding on to people, and attitudes that were keeping me from growing.  It's a hard thing to explain.  Imagine a person who's completely unfit to function socially and internally.  Then imagine that person being stripped of the thing that was causing them that discomfort.  Then imagine that discomfort fading away slowly, leaving residue along the way as the person continues to change.  That was me during the summer.  I was very much enlightened and enriched by my experience working at the day care center.  I think that was instrumental in helping me to mature.  I look at myself in several stages; there's a few Fieldston stages, the first of which I liked but as my personality deteriorates in those stages, I like who I was less and less.  Then there's the stage where I've transferred to A. Philip Randolph.  That stage is riddled with relief, depression, and feelings of failure and detachment.  Then there's the summer, where I'm relieved that I don't go to a school that is nothing more than a reminder of how bad I fucked up at Fieldston and I feel like I can just forget it all.  I liked myself during the summer--I think I was in an ok place.  I dislike myself at Fieldston.  And I pity myself at Randolph last year.  This past fall, I was starting to grow more.  I was nearing the point of having been in therapy with Michael for a year and I was starting to be able to see the differences and the growth.  But I made some bad mistakes in the Fall, and I don't like those actions.  I also burned several bridges that Fall--without building new ones.  And that made me lonely in the winter.  But every Friday, I would find myself at Michael's office feeling more confident, feeling like I was on the right track, feeling like my lonesome feelings would pass.  In the Spring, I built new bridges and my lonelyness passed.  I've brought these feelings of maturity, direction, and confidence in my moral fiber and my decision-making into the summer.  I feel great these days and I look back sometimes to months ago and I see a completely different person.  I don't dwell on the past anymore--I'm too busy looking to the future.  I learned that to be comfortable, you don't always have to have someone to talk to, sometimes you have to have time that you dedicate to yourself and personal growth.  I also learned that life is not only about building bridges, but also about burning them.    Thank-you's? Daniel--you're constant solidarity has always been a guidance to me.  We're a team at everything and I wouldn't have it any other way.  You may not realize it but I aspire to many of your qualities.    Michael--you're not going to read this, but I'll go on anyway.  I used to wonder why you never talk very much during our meetings and why I always have to lead the conversation.  Now I know that what you've taught me is much more valuable than the things you could have been saying.  You taught me and you're still teaching me how to make the right decisions and figure out my feelings for myself--rather than acting out in opposition to them.  Everyone from school--all the people from school have been so great this year.  I would have never known that I was going to love my school this much if anyone had asked me last year.  And I love my school because of the warm, outgoing people that attend it.  My parents--for knowing that no matter how bad things got, I could always figure out how to pull through on my own and never judging me when I was down and out.  This whole thing is probably very confusing and hard to follow, but long story short, I'm happier than I've ever been before, I've changed  a lot , and all those good things are all thanks to a number of influential people in my life, and some long, hard, self-reflection.
