She spends hours on the phone, she's forever painting her nails, fiddling with her hair and experimenting with makeup. The posters on her walls have changed from cuddly puppies to Orlando Bloom looking for all the world like a lecherous pedophile ready to pounce on my daughter - oh wait no, that's Ginge :)  The other day we were in the middle of laundry so she had on some old shorts and a tank that was far too small for her. Cleavage was everywhere, curves were there in places where there shouldn't be curves yet (at least not in my mind). It was startling. She looked older, and yet she was sitting on the couch playing with bubbles like a kid. I just can't get my head around this weirdness.  Of course she just laughs at me, or rolls her eyes when I point out all of this to her. She says she doesn't feel any different than she did last week and that I'm just being weird. Well, yes I am being weird, but it is a weird feeling. I wish I could explain it better. Maybe Kat will get some idea of it when her kidlets reach this age.  I find myself comparing her to what I remember of my teen years, or my sister's since Kelly (my sis) is 8 years younger than me, I can remember what she was like. I'm trying to avoid the pitfalls I remember. I'm probably more lenient with my daughter than my mom was with me; I know I talk to her more than my mom did with me about things that weren't big subjects when I was a teen (finances, sex, drugs and all that).   Anyway, enough of that. If anyone sees Arya around TCZ on Saturday, wish her a happy 13th and don't mind me sobbing in the corner.
