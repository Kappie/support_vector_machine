What usually happens is one person will post a decent article and everybody else decides to link to that post in their blogs. I guess all the yuppy entrepreneurs don't like to have their genious innovative abilities taxed on a real blog of their own.  Seeing as its a fad, I decided to jump aboard the link train with this post. You may argue that this is not correct, because I'm usually not regarded as an innovative genious. Therefore I cannot theoritcally become a member of this fad, or... elite "link-group", if you will. But hey, why not at least try and fit in with the preps? The worst that can happen is nobody will ever read my blog..  Shut up.  Quoted from 800CEOREAD:  The whole premise of his book is based on the work psychologist Alfred Alder. Alder believed human personality was formed at the intersection of three conditions:      * the you as others see you     * the you as you see yourself     * the you as you would like to be seen   From the book:      According to Alder, the more these three views harmonize, the stronger one's personality becomes. And with a harmonious personality, there is a corresponding diminution of inner conflicts and misunderstandings between the outside world and the individual.    Originally I was tempted to disagree and add another dimension: * the you  But as I read that last bit over a few times I realised that the idea was that the intersection, or harmonization of the three aspects formed "the you". After all, we live in a world of perception.  (I notice Machiavelli in the distance, old but determined. He is climbing a hill and he reaches the top. He wheezes his last wheez and laughs his last triumphant laugh. I turn back to my computer damning the old bastard as he dies on the hill.)  Maybe I've got it. Or Alder is all wrong, in which case I'm wrong too... I think. That's the problem with philosophy, you can't prove a damn thing... I think.
