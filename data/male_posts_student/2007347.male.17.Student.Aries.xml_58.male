In order, to keep this site alive I know I have to keep adding and updatig, but I haven't felt the urge. I think it's due to the intensity of my thoughts (or lack there of). But once again I have had sleeping problems and again I turn to my website for aid.   My holidays have been calm and collected. A few get together with friends and such. It appears that this will continue.  As of late i have been focusing my efforts on the Trigun Project and have written 11 Episode summaries with quotes and summary of the contribution of the episdoe to the overall plot. There are 26 episodes in total and I have to write character profiles and throw in any other miscelanous information I can find. That's to set up the site, I then have to affiliate it with as many other Trigun Fan sites as possible. It will be alot of work, but if i finish it it will be the one of the most detailed Trigun fan sites on the internet. For love and peace!  Although I am pleased with the current status of my site in general, and the amount of my visitors, I regret I am unhappy with the lack of comments on this blog itself. I am also unhappy with the forum usage, all members were members of the ceased COA forum; no new blood has joined. Join the forums today and start something! http://coa.ausut.com/forum  I will be diverting my attensions away from the Trigun project temporally, to create more sections in the main site and catch up on Blog entries.
