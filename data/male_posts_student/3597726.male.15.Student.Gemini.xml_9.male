Besides that, there's nothing going...  I have a really cool idea for a novel, though. Yeah. You heard me. I didn't say flash or novellette, I said N-O-V-E-L. Anyway, I think its pretty sweet. I'll try to post some stuff about it on here since its going to be such a big hit. I wish. Hey, no laws against dreaming...  Here's a bit about it...  Ok, the setting is usually in modern day...on earth. Sometimes, it'll be on other worlds. Actually, more like other 'peoples minds' really, if that makes sense. Its going to be awhile before I finish the outline. It'll also be very confusing.   Anyway, I'm to tired to post anymore. I'll sleep on it and see what happens...
