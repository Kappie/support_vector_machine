Shit-Ben…where do I sleep?!’  I stirred in my peaceful serenity when an arrogant feminine/Manly voice said in menace…  ‘HeLoOOo? Anyone there?!’  There it was again…please tell me I’m dreaming…I squinted my eyes shut hoping that I was just having a nightmare….  …Quiet….  I breathed in a sigh of relief and busied myself trying to get comfortable on the couch with my eyes still securely shut…I tossed and turned while hugging a soft cushion…  Sleepily I lay in a comfortable position and slowly began to drift off…  Something was tugging at my hair…I brushed my hair with an easy swift of my hand….after twitching my nose I prepared myself to drift off…  Again, there was this annoying tugging sensation on my hair…figuring I was just being paranoid I didn’t move and instead of swatting at my hair again I waited for the tugging sensation to go away…. ‘AAhhHHhHHhhHH!!!!!’  My eyes widened in shock and pain as I gently stroked my precious hair, I grumbled in annoyance and turned around to face my attacker…it was probably Jake being a jealous idiot because my hair was more silkier and softer then his so he had decided to yank out a whole clump of my hair…daMn idiot...  I turned around and my eyes grew wider…that lesbian girl…Sheesh…she just can’t get enough of me huh? I figured that she had yanked my hair out to put in her personal stash of her ‘BULC member possessions…’  My eyes narrowed into dime slots as I gave her my best evils…with my lips pressed together showing I was extremely annoyed I tried to intimidate her and make her feel uneasy…  She stood there with her arms crossed not the least bit moved by my attempt…Obviously my plan back fired…if I was trying to make someone feel small and nervous…That person would be me…*sigh*  ‘Stop looking constipated and tell me where I’m supposed to sleep’ she retorted.  ‘What?!...ME? Constipated?!’ I yelled back in astonishment  ‘Yeah YOU!!!’ She said emphasizing the word ‘you’  I had to admit…for pretty girls like her, she sure knew how to make me feel inferior, and I thought that GUYS were meant to make girls feel that way…  I gave out an exaggerated groan making sure I did it right in her face to show how annoying she was…  ‘Sleep anywhere…’ I replied.  ‘If you wanted to know you could’ve just asked you know no need to pull my hair’ I started again sounding aggravated.  Her face turned cherry red…huh? Did I say something wrong? I stood there dumbfounded wondering what had gotten her in such a crap mood…  ‘I DID ASK!!! YOU IDIOT!!! YOU WERE TOO BUSY IN LA-LA LAND!!!’ she blew her top off  Wow…this girl sure had temper problems…maybe I should steer clear of her for a couple of days…or maybe the next 100 days….  She stamped her foot like a little girl…in other circumstances I’d say she looked cute when she was angry…but right now, since I wasn’t in the ‘best’ mood I could be in, she had a shocking resemblance to a stubborn cow….hmmm….  I stood there staring at her while she chucked a tantrum…this was amusing, If I had been more tired then I already was…I would’ve been certain she had given out a loud, long… ‘MoOOOoOoO’  *Whack!!!*  While I was thinking, the lesbian Girl had somehow gotten close enough to me to whack me at the back of my head…urGh…she sure was violent.  ‘What the Heck was that for?!’ I said annoyingly at her while touching the back of my head.  She smirked that same, annoying smirk she always had…Man, she was really pissing me off…if she wasn’t a girl I would’ve wiped that smirk off her face by throwing a big, fat punch on her face…Ooo…that would be fun….  ‘You were staring at me you idiot…don’t you know it’s rude to stare?!’ she retorted rudely…  I stood there flabbergasted and dumbfounded…had I been staring? I didn’t realize…whoops...hehehe…  ‘Just staring at a stubborn Cow’ I said while facing the other way and feeling cool about my come back  *Thwack!*   ‘Aww…shit!!’ I yelled in pain when she hit me for the second time on the back of my head…  I spun around to face her with my deadly glare [Dime slot eyes and pressed lips]…She didn’t seem to be moved at all…*sigh*…again, I had failed my attempt to make her feel inferior…Damn Woman…  I ignored her this time and walked briskly to the bathroom intending to inspect the damage she had done to my hair…  I checked all parts of my hair and found a big chunk of hair missing from one side!!!...I leaned in to inspect the damage caused by the tyrant…  Oh shit…there was a clear and visible bold patch…great…not only was my face badly damaged by her Man-fist punches but now she had given me a frigging bold patch!!!  This was by far…the most miserable day I’ve ever had…how was I going to face my lovely fans?! They’d probably ditch me for someone who isn’t even half the man I am…they could even begin to worship ‘Fat Cat’…and that’s not even a bloody man!!!  Or maybe they’ll like pimps better…  *Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts*  Fat Man sitting on the couch watching TV surrounded by empty packets of chips and beer bottles…  His laughter sounds the room while he’s surrounded by my former fans…that are showing him affection…they used to do that to me too…  I’m sitting in the corner of the room while all the hot girls surround that-that-that….DOLL BLUDGER!!!   I crouch in the corner hugging my legs while rocking back and forth with endless tears streaming down my face….  ‘Girls…w-what *sniffle* a-about…your s-s-sexy man *sniffle* Benjamin Uy?’ I say in-between snuffles…had they completely forgotten about me?  ‘What about *sniffle* BULC what happened? *sniffle*’ I asked them while hugging myself tightly…my clothes were soaked with tears now…  One of the girls tilts her head towards me while she caressed the fat man’s chest….  ‘BULC? That was in the past…I don’t even know why I was a member of that stupid club…it’s BBLC now…’ she said in disgust while she talked about BULC…  How could she? It pained my heart…she was once one of the girls who loved me the most…  ‘BBLC?’ I asked her dumbfounded at her retort…  ‘BULL BLUDGER LOVERS CLUB!!!’ all the other girls screamed excitedly in unison while they pampered that disgusting animal like he was God…it was a disgusting sight…  From the corner of my eye I saw Fat Cat walk by with more fans surrounding ‘it’  ‘NoOOoOoOoOooOooo!!!’ I yelled in agony not wishing to believe I was unloved…  *End of Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts*  ‘No!!’ I shrieked.  Huh? What? Oh, it wasn’t real…Thank God…  I thought about what I had dreamt of…BULC? I think this is a sign from God that I have to do something unless I want that dream to become a reality…*sigh*    CHAPTER 12  [Nicky’s P.O.V.] After Ben walked to the bathroom ignoring my hit to his head I smirked to myself yet again, that idiot was such a sissy…  I looked at my surroundings and went exploring in his apartment…kitchen, bathroom, toilet, 2 bedrooms, and a family room…hMms…not bad I guess  One bedroom was Ben’s…I could tell because there were posters of cars and girls all over the place…the arrogant pig-head…*sigh*…  In the other bedroom it had a mattress and that was about it…I decided that this would be my new room…perfect…  Busily I went to the family room and grabbed my few belongings and settled in to my new bedroom making myself at home…  Just as I was about to go to sleep Ben barged into my new room like an idiot…  ‘By the way…what’s your name?’ he asked me flabbergasted…  He looked like he had just run a marathon…  I stood there dumbfounded for a while before replying…  ‘NIcky…Just call me Nicky’ I said not letting my guard down just incase he was planning to get revenge on me…  ‘Nicky hey? Hmms…that’s a nice name…but I prefer stubborn cow or lesbian girl’ he said before jolting out of my room like a flash…  I sat on the mattress confused at what he had said…when I had taken it all in and realized he was insulting me I ran out of my room and it was my turn to barge into his…  I turned the door knob furiously before realizing he had locked the door already…why that conniving bugger…  ‘Open the door Benjamin Uy!!!’ I yelled while pounding furiously on the door making a big racket…  ‘Stubborn Cow! Stubborn Cow! Stubborn Cow!’ he taunted and teased on the other side…  ArgH…that arrogant brat…Damn Him!!!  ‘OPEN THE FRIGGING DOOR RIGHT NOW IF YOU DON’T WANT A FISTFUL IN YOUR LOUD MOUTH!!!’ I yelled at the top of my lungs while turning as red as a tomato…  ‘I’m not completely stupid you know!!!’ he yelled back, obviously refusing to budge from his position…  ‘I’ll kick this door down if I have to…then you’ll be sorry…’ I said in a deadly whisper loud enough so he could hear me seething with wrath…  There was silence on the other side…he was probably thinking of an escape route…hahaha…he was in deep shit now…by the time I’m going to be finished with him…he’ll have a hell of a lot things to complain about…possibly a medical bill…  ‘Open the door now or I swear I’m going to kick this door down and you’ll be in for it!!!’ I yelled again deciding to give him a second chance…  ‘…1…’ I said beginning my count down…  ‘…2…’ the tension was beginning to increase along with the suspense…I backed away from the door intending to get a run up…  ‘…3!!!’ I yelled before charged at the door and closing my eyes…  Just as I was about to hit the wood of the door Ben unlocked the door and I ran straight into him causing him to fall down with a thump…  I heard him curse to himself about the pain he was in…I leaned in closely to see his hurt expression his forehead was creased and his eyebrows formed a frown…  For the first time…I began to realize that Ben really wasn’t a bad guy…he just acted like an arrogant pig now and then…but other then that, he was alright…his face showed sincerity and honesty…and he sure knew how to hold his temper! Although he thought he was all that it did make him look like a fool…even if he was quite cute…  Who knows…maybe he could be my entertainment for the next 100 days to come…I stared intently into his eyes while he looked into mine…It seemed as if he was searching for something…like he was trying to understand me…to find a weakness in me…  After a few moments we began to realize the awkward situation and both of us quickly turned away as I realized I was laying on top of him…I got up quickly and smoothed out my PJ’s…  He sat up from the floor and I got a good look at him…his PJ’s were very peculiar for a guy…Blue Care Bear teddy top and Starry Pants with Moon shapes as well…  I sighed loudly while tsking him…and giggling light heartedly…  ‘What’s so funny?’ he asked me confusingly  ‘Nothing…I’m going to sleep now...I think I’ve already gotten enough pay back for today…just looking at your girlish PJ’s will already make you embarrassed’ I said before walking back to my room trying to suppress my laughter…  I could picture Ben right now staring down at his PJ’s and looking in the direction I had walked in…then staring back down at his PJ’s before actually getting the message…and turning bright red…  I giggled to myself…*sigh*...Ben really was the most slowest pig ever…  I settled down on the mattress and pulled the covers over my body...I began to think how annoying and irritating Ben could be…him and his arrogant ways…it was quite amusing seeing him angry…  I began to drift off to sleep…     CHAPTER 13  [Ben’s P.O.V.] I woke up at 11:00am…earlier then Nicky of course…  Today is the 23rd of August...I decided that a Contract should be drawn up if both of us were to keep our word…obviously I would, I’m not that dirty and I don’t resort to trickery…but I can’t say so much about her…  I got out a piece of paper while I busily wrote down a contract agreement…My tongue always seems to stick out when I’m concentrating hard…and it was sticking out again…I never seemed to notice it before…but now I do…  When I was done it read-  Evidence of Contract Agreement  Nicky will stay with Benjamin Uy for 100 days counting day one as 23rd August…During the 100 days…she is not to physically abuse or insult Benjamin Uy, as he is God’s gift to women and should be treated with respect…  After 100 days when it lies on the 1st of December, Nicky is required to return the belongs that she had dirtily stole ferociously from innocent Benjamin Uy…who is the victim in this whole dealing.  On the bottom of this sheet, please sign your name as prove of agreement…going back on the deal will cause severe punishment to Nicky only as she is not Benjamin Uy who is a literal chick magnet…  Signature here Signature here Nicky- Benjamin Uy-  ----- I stepped back to admire my work…It looked a bit plain to me so I decided to decorate it a bit…on the side a drew a devil with horns…and an angel with a halo…I think these two pictures represent Nicky and I perfectly…  I trudged to her room feeling pleased with myself that I had thought of the whole contract thing and made it as fair as it could possibly be…I no longer thought that she was a BULC member...so I didn’t have to worry that she would tell everyone else that I was mean…  I knocked on her door and no one answered…it was 11:30am now…  I quietly twisted the door knob and opened the door silently…it made a slight creaking sound that made me wince…beads of sweat dripped down my face hopping that she wasn’t going to ambush me with an uncalled for attack…  Who ever said that girls were submissive must’ve had severe brain damage…I erased all thought of that stupid, false statement and decided to rely on my senses instead…that is if I want to survive the tyrants ferocious attacks on me…  To my relief I let out a contempt sigh as I saw her on the floor snoozing away like a pig…I crept up towards her face and poked her a little in the cheek trying to wake her up…she twitched her nose in reply and tossed her body to the other side…that didn’t seem to work…  This time I prodded her near her shoulder trying to get her to stir and wake up…nothing happened again…I whispered in her ear trying to tell her to wake up but to no avail she didn’t budge…  She sure was a heavy sleeper…after coming up with the conclusion that I wasn’t trying hard enough I decided to be more aggressive…besides I wanted payback for yanking a big clump of my hair out…  I reached out and her hair was in my grasp but then I thought to myself…what if she counter attacked and this was just a plan of hers and when I least expected it she would jump out at me…I withdrew my hand as more beads of sweat ran down my forehead…  Forming a frown on my forehead I had no idea what to do…this was the perfect chance to pounce on her and catch her off guard but I didn’t know what evil thing I could do to her…urgh…Benjamin Uy you really are thick sometimes…  I decided to see if she was faking it or not…  ‘Nicky…wake up!!!’ I said quite loudly…  She gave out a groan and mumbled a little before settling back down and pulling the sheets over her shoulders…  I let out a sigh of relief knowing I still had the perfect chance to get my revenge…  At that time I couldn’t think of anything really evil to do to her besides pull her hair…as I grabbed her hair in my hand gently I stopped again…and I thought of an evil plan…I smirked to myself and silently crept out of her room and into mine…  I got my stereo system and placed them all besides her ears completely surrounded her…then I cranked up the volume and put on a loud Rock Music CD in…  When the speakers were placed in position I crept back out of her room with the remote control in my hand…then I got a mop and held onto the opposite end while edging towards her face…I smothered her with the mop and I hear her muffled sounds…it seemed as if she was cursing…as soon as I sensed that she was going to wake up I quickly with drew the mop from her room and closed the door while pressing the ‘PLAY’ button on the remote…  All of a sudden I heard her scream as the extremely loud rock music boomed throughout the whole building…*sigh*…Music to my ears…this was my pay back for sure…and this wasn’t the end of it…  I heard heavy footsteps nearing her door…I held on to the door knob tightly not allowing her to escape the loud music…  ‘BEN!!! I’M GOING TO KICK YOUR SORRY ASS FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!’ she screamed her lungs out…  I smirked to myself knowing I had got her this time…  After a few moments of cursing and threats directed my way I decided to end her torture and I turned the speakers off…she was probably deaf by now…I sneered when I finally let her out…  I turned around and walked to my room intending to get down to business and get her to sigh the contract leaving her free from her loud prison…  *Thump*  I heard the shrill scream of Nicky…I ran towards the direction and saw her lying flat on the ground clutching her elbow…  When I finally realized that the mop was wet and she had slipped on the puddle of water the mop had left behind I felt guilty…I didn’t mean to go that far…  For the next 5 minutes she kept complaining that her arm hurt so I took her to the doctor…he said that she had a fractured arm so he placed a cast around it…  When we got back she gave me a cold glare and continued to make me feel more worse then I already did…she threw curses and insults my way…most of which she called me an arrogant pig….  I constantly said sorry to her and repeated myself saying that I didn’t intentionally want to make her fall…  It was amazing how many curses she could say in one breath…I counted a total of 27…I never got bored of hearing her insult me…Don’t get me wrong…I found it really offensive but she sure knew a lot of swear words…not to mention threats that she directed towards me menacingly…     CHAPTER 14  [Ben’s P.O.V.] After she was out of breath I decided to bring up the contract…I sauntered to my room and got the agreement sheet I had drew up earlier….I was proud of my efforts…  I handed it to her without saying a word…  ‘What’s this?’ she asked me confused.  ‘Read it’ I replied casually…  I heard her busily reading the page while her eyes moved back and forth she mumbled the words…  With each second that passed her expression grew more angry and her forehead began to show creases with her eyebrows arched in a frown…  ‘What the hell is this?’ she started again, obviously being unfair about the whole situation…  ‘Read it’ I retorted  ‘I’ve already read it…this is a load of crap…in an agreement you can’t be bias you have to be fair!’ she yelled back feeling frustration and a right to have justice boil inside of her…  ‘What are you talking about? I’ve read through it, and it seems completely fair to me…there’s nothing wrong with it’ I retorted back defending myself…  She scoffed at me rather rudely…  ‘Nothing wrong with it? Let me read it again for you…’ came her reply as she pulled the agreement towards her face…  ‘Evidence of Contract Agreement  Nicky will stay with Benjamin Uy for 100 days counting day one as 23rd August…During the 100 days…she is not to physically abuse or insult Benjamin Uy, as HE IS GOD’S GIFT TO WOMEN AND SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT…  After 100 days when it lies on the 1st of December, Nicky is required to return the belongs that she had DIRTILY STOLE FEROCIOUSLY from INNOCENT Benjamin Uy…WHO IS THE VICTIM in this whole dealing.  On the bottom of this sheet, please sign your name as prove of agreement…going back on the deal will cause severe punishment to Nicky ONLY as she is not Benjamin Uy who is a literal chick magnet…’ she made sure she emphasized particular bits of the agreement…[I have no idea why though]   She stared at me after, waiting for some sort of reaction…  I remained calm and solemn still not understanding why she felt the need to justify my actions…what was her problem…this contract is 100% fair in every way…  ‘So? What’s wrong with it’ came my dumbfounded respond.  Again, she scoffed at me…obviously there was something I was missing or something that she didn’t see…maybe she hadn’t written up a contract agreement before…I nodded my head understandingly…that would explain why she thought my contract was unfair…  ‘Hmm…I don’t know…all of it!’ she retorted sarcastically…  I looked at her blankly not knowing what to say…I don’t get it…what’s wrong with it…  ‘What do you mean by ‘all of it” I asked her trying to get her to elaborate…  She sighed loudly making me feel dumb…  ‘Your discriminating me…which your NOT allowed to do in a fair agreement…you’re being unfair by saying ‘going back on the deal will cause severe punishment to Nicky ONLY’…what kind of a fair agreement is this…and you make yourself look like the good guy while I look evil and heartless!!!’ she retorted at me trying to make a point…  ‘Don’t be absurd…how can I make myself look like the good guy and make you look heartless?!...I didn’t write that down!’ I snapped at her trying to get her to see the facts…  Again she scoffed at me…damn…her scoffing problem was beginning to get annoying…I should’ve asked the doctor if she had any mental problems…  ‘Oh Yeah?!...how do you explain the constant praising of yourself and the constant put downs that you add into the agreement to make me look bad and make you look good?’ she asked me in a know-it-all way…  ‘I did not! I never wrote down… ‘Nicky is a stubborn cow’ or ‘Nicky is evil’!!!’ I retorted back defensively…  She groaned at me hinting that I wasn’t getting the message…but I got it perfectly well…she just didn’t know how to draw up an agreement…that’s all…  I was going to stick with my story…she was just jealous of my excellent skills…and I find it very offensive that she thinks that my agreement is worthless…honestly, she could show a little more respect towards my fine work…  ‘How do you explain the picture of a cow with devil horns and a red hot poker on the side where I’m meant to sign and on the other side where you’re meant to sign it has a picture of what looks like a male model with a halo on top of his head?!’ she screeched at me…  ‘Oh…you like my artwork?!’ I asked her excitedly forgetting about the whole point of this argument…  At least she could tell what the pictures were…I felt proud of myself again, not only was I blessed with shockingly good looks and charm, I was also talented with artwork…wow…you really are something, Ben…  She groaned even louder this time…she was beginning to get fed up with me…  ‘YOU ARE SUCH A SLOW PIG!!!’ she shrieked at me…  ‘Huh?’ I blurted out confused about the whole situation…  She sighed loudly and got out a piece of paper and pen…  ‘Sit down Ben’ she ordered me…  I did as I was told and I sat down obediently beside her as she wrote down the title…  ‘FAIR contract agreement’  She really was a stubborn cow sometimes…sheesh…I bet she just couldn’t stand the fact that my work was shockingly impressive towards her standards…and her, being the stubborn cow she is couldn’t stand the fact that I had thought of something before her…so she had to be the boss and draw up her own contract…  Just because she was new at this sort of thing didn’t mean she had to discriminate my good work…I sighed to myself disappointed that we weren’t going to use my contract…  Nicky raised an eyebrow at me but I chose to ignore it and brush it off…I stared into space while I waited for her to finish the contract…  ‘Done!’ she exclaimed happily I snapped out of my thoughts to face her…then I looked at the agreement…  It read-  FAIR Contract Agreement  Nicky will stay with Benjamin Uy for 100 days counting day one as 23rd August…after the finish date of 100 days [1st December] Nicky will be required to return the belongings of Benjamin Uy that she currently possesses.  During the 100 days Benjamin Uy is expected to treat Nicky as an equal and she, the same. In the household both parties will be allowed to do as they please, the only condition that they should follow is that the opposite party is expected to live before the 100 days are over.  Please sign at the bottom of this sheet to show your agreement is true.  Signature Here Signature Here Benjamin Uy- Nicky-  ---  I finished reading the agreement, I had to admit…It was relatively good…of course not as good as mine though…and there weren’t even any decorations either!  Who did she think she was, some rich girl with such a good education…sheesh…she didn’t have to use such big words…I mean…we’re no rocket scientists…I mumbled my feelings out…luckily she didn’t hear though…she just shot me another weird look…  Personally I think that my contract was by far better than hers…I don’t know what she was thinking about when she wrote her contract up…no idea…  Whatever she says…I’m still going to keep the original contract that I drew up because I really admire my work…hehehe…maybe I should even frame it…hmms…  I reluctantly signed the agreement and she did too….after the signing I decided to frame the agreement that she had drew up since we were using that one now…and not mine…*sigh*…  My original agreement with my wonderful artwork, I kept it in my room and stuck it on my wall…hehehe…     CHAPTER 15  [Nicky’s P.O.V.] *24th August*  I woke up at 8:00am and this time by my own free will…  Lazily I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, Ben was already awake and he was in the process of squeezing tooth paste on his crystal, blue, brush…  ‘Morning’ he said not bothering to look up.  ‘Morning’ came my greeting as I scratched my head sleepily.  I took my green brush and he handed me the toothpaste tube…he started brushing his teeth and I soon followed after…  Lazily, my eyes gazed around the bathroom…Ben noticed me staring at a vase of flowers that were placed on top of the sink…  ‘They’re daffodils’ he tried to say while his mouth was full of foam and toothpaste…  I looked at him dumbfounded…then I looked at the flowers again…yellow…they look nice; I wonder if they smell nice…  As if Ben could read my mind he spoke up again.  ‘Daffodil’s smell nice; go ahead…take a whiff’ he told me inbetween brushing.  I looked at him hesitantly making sure he wasn’t going to try anything funny….he gave me an innocent look in return so I leaned in closer and clenched my toothbrush in my mouth…  When I was about to take in a deep breath of flowers, the tap suddenly turned on and Ben splashed water all over my face…I jolted my head upwards and…  *Bump!*  ‘AWw…shit!’ I cried out surprised…  I had forgotten that the bathroom mirror was also a door for a little storage place...and it just so happened that I was directly beneath it…  ‘ARgh! Benjamin come back here!’ I yelled at him…while I washed my face and spat out the foam from my mouth…  I could hear his quick footsteps already out of the bathroom…damn him!  ‘You’re going to get it Ben!’ I shrieked at him…  When I had finished wiping my face…I went in search of Ben…  ‘Ben?!’ I called out…  All of a sudden the bathroom door slammed shut…what the? Aww crap…damn that conniving pig…he was probably hiding next to the door all this time…  ‘You’ll have to come out sometime Ben!!!’ I hollered at him…  Deciding to wait at the door till he came out…I sat in front of the door…after a few minutes, I began to get hungry so I gave up…  I figured he’d be hungry too so I made us both some pancakes and syrup…  ‘MmM…can you smell it Ben…smells sOoO good!!!...it’s pancakes and syrup…yum yum!’ I taunted and teased on the other side of the door…  There was no sound…I wondered if he had already gone out…I placed the plate of pancakes and syrup on the table and I checked his room…empty…  That’s strange, I wonder what he’s doing…hmm…ah wells…he can starve for all I care…  I hurried to the table where I had left the plate eagerly wanting to take a bite from my yummy pancakes, to my shock it was gone…what the?...I spun around, just in time to see Ben, still in his Care Bear PJ’s rush to his room with MY plate of pancakes!...  ‘HEY!!!...BENJAMIN, YOU IGNORANT PIG!!!! THOSE ARE MY PANCAKES!!!’ I screamed at the top of my lungs…  He slammed the door shut and locked it…*sigh*…  The mind of that guy…sheesh…I shook my head in disbelieve…that cheeky little brat!  ‘YOU’LL HAVE TO COME OUT SOMETIME!!!...YOU KNOW, NO ONE CAN STOP YOU FROM GOING TO THE TOILET!!!...OR HAVING A SHOWER AND YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE TO EAT AGAIN ANYWAY!!!’ I yelled out loud enough for him to hear…  This time there was a reply…  ‘I already went to the toilet, if I don’t drink then I don’t need to go to the toilet…and umm…I don’t want to waste money so I’m not taking a shower today…and umm…I’m on a diet!!!’ he yelled back through the door…  What the? On a diet?  ‘That’s the most lamest thing I’ve heard from you Ben!’ I retorted.  This time there was no reply…I decided to settle down and watch some TV until Ben came out of his room…what a sissy girl…and he nicknames ME the stubborn cow…sheesh!  For the whole day Ben didn’t come out of his room…I was actually quite surprised because he had only eaten breakfast and that was about it…  When it was dinner time he finally came out while I was cooking…  ‘Oo…what smells so nice?!’ he asked me while taking a deep breath and inhaling the aroma of assorted fish, poultry and vegetables…  I smirked to myself…  ‘Oh…nothing much…just cooking dinner’ I replied casually like it was no big deal…  ‘You can cook?!’ He blurted out in surprise and astonishment  His eyes were as big as golf balls and his mouth was hanging open…I couldn’t help but giggle at his funny expression…  ‘Yeah…I can cook!’ I replied in an accusing way trying to sound as if I took offensive to his question…I didn’t want to make him think I was going soft…that way my next move wouldn’t seem so suspicious…  ‘Sit down Ben…the rice is almost ready…’ I told him while going back to my cooking…  He sat down obediently and waited quietly for me to finish cooking…  When I had finished I spooned rice into two bowls and placed all the dishes on the table…then we began eating…  I ate something from every plate except for the beans…  Mm...This tastes great…Oo...that’s good! Mmm...Delicious!’ he praised me…  ‘You think?’ I would say while laughing light heartedly at him…  I had to admit, the way he ate was quite cute…and boy could he eat! His mouth kept on chewing and his hand went back and forth grabbing fish, chicken and vegetables from each dish…  When his chopsticks reached for the beans…I couldn’t help but form a sneer on my face…my mouth began to curve and form a grin as he took a large serving of beans and drew them close to his mouth…  As the beans entered his mouth in one quick motion my eyes glistened awaiting the expected reaction…  To my surprise he just kept eating…and chewing…and gulping…my expression soon changed to dumbfounded…I scratched my head in confusion wondering why the 3 packets of ‘Super Chili Powder-Twice as much power’ hadn’t worked…  ‘AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’ Ben jolted up from his chair and ran to the tap like a mad man…  AHhh…it had worked…I must remember that Ben isn’t like any other guy…he’s a little slower…*sigh*…  I sat back in my chair and relaxed…*sigh*  ‘Music to my ears…’ I said to myself dreamily as I heard Ben’s shrill voice screaming his head off as if screaming would stop the burning sensation on his tongue…  I had to admit…it took a little longer than I had expected for Ben to cool down…the tap was running non-stop and his head was tilted on a side while trying to stop the burning feeling that he was experiencing he even stamped on his feet and waved his arms in the air like a hysterical weirdo…or someone who was undertaking a sever seizure right now…this was way too amusing…I should do this more often...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TO BE CONTINUED~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~WAIT FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER~~~~~~~~~~~~~
