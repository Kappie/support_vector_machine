Irag never attacked us, and bush did say they had WMDs but that wasnt the only reason we fought...theres this small thing called genocide (were you kills millions because you pretty much dont like somthing about them) in iraq. Osama bin laden did attack us on sept 11, 01 and so that gave us the right to attack him...now if anyone says we shouldnt have attacked iraq because there genocide isnt our problem is stupid, Although it wasnt affecting us they are still people and deserve to live with out being hsot in the night time...that gave us the right to attack Iraq. and if u say it wasnt... u must think that the holocust was somthing we shoulda let fly by.  "its better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees."  well i responded with this  well that wasent nice (no eprops) but as i have said, many times, we had no  urlLink legal resons for war with iraq . i do not believe we had the right, or purpous to attack iraq, and by the way, the holocost and iraq are two different things entirley, sadam decided that was the way to run his country, thats the way dictoatorships work, now hitler, he decided to take over the world, and kill millions of jewish people, inlcuinding those of the countries he deciced to take over, hitslers plan was to take over the world, sadam just wanted to run his own contry! yes sadam was evil, but NO it was not our responcibilty to take care of him!just becuase we are the usa that does not give us the right to invade a nation for oil, yes  urlLink OIL , what the hell was it supposed to be for? to free the iraqi people? for  urlLink WMD'S ? NOPE actualy we dident free anyone, we forced a new goverment on them, that they may or may not have liked. we puprpoulsy diliberatly attacked  urlLink Civilion Targets , where civilions had to die! the official reson for war was for, and i say it for hopefuly the last time  urlLink WMD'S  absoulty none were found at all, and even if they DID have wmd's they couldent attack us! iraq has a very poor  urlLink missle program  and none of them would be able to reach the us anyways! it was not to free the iraqi civilions, actualy it hurt (this link contains graphic image of blood and viloence, viewer decretion is advised)  urlLink them  sadom also did not know, or had no links to  urlLink terrorists  so he was absolutly no threat to us! btw that has nothing to do with what im talking about, the war wasent about freeing iraqis, it was about (oil) but officialy we were looking for those darned wmds, but none were found during those un searches, they say, uhhh man theres no wmds here, so what does  urlLink bush  say? " urlLink Bring it on " and what abot that  urlLink patriot act  we have turned into a  urlLink dictatorship!  we dont get out basic rights if we are accused of being a terrorist or a possible harm to our country, even if we dident to it!  urlLink they  can search your home, you dont have the right to a trial anymore, do you? NOPE! do you have the right to talk to your family? no you dont! you just  urlLink rot in jail  for doing nothing! what does bush do on 9/11 whyle out country is under attack? he  urlLink reads!   urlLink a secirity official tells him "our nation is under attack"  what does he do? hop into action, get on plaining? nope he  urlLink reads  for a few more minutes! and on that last note, i believe we should  urlLink impeach  bush, he does not deserve to be our president! sean roberts  please click on all the links (things in a different color, i think orange), they are real
