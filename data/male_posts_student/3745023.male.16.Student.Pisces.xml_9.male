Not much news today, just some German Scientists  publishing some research that seems to fit in with my previous theories on esp. Also, it may be worth noting that there were more UFO sightings in the last week than in this year so far, and several groups of animals are behaving strangely, including some pelicans just off the coast where one of the siting were.  NEWS FLASH!!!!  RFID NEWS!  German Scientist Dr Stefan Schmidt have found evidence they believe suggests we have a sixth . Dr Stefan Schmidt and his team carried out two experiments a thousand times, which is really a small number in comparison to similar studies, and believe they have finally proved the reality of the preternatural perception in humans. The first, called "remote staring", consisted of a volunteer in a sealed room watching a second volunteer in another room via CCTV. The second volunteer was hooked up to electrodes which recorded the "prickle" or electrical activity of the skin. This was compared when the volunteer was or was not being watched. In the second experiment, called "direct mental interaction", the first volunteer concentrated on making the second feel uncomfortable or relaxed from within the sealed cell. The German team used a complex statistical scale to grade the studies according to reliability and paranormal effect recorded. It is worth noting that complexity is often a disguise for inaccuracy.  In other experiments, the starer tried to make the other feel either uncomfortable or relaxed. Again, the electronic monitor proved repeatedly that it could be done. In the British Journal of Psychology, Dr Schmidt noted that the data was ambiguous but found that "for both data sets there is a small but significant effect". In similar experiments, when assuming we catch 10% of those who cheat and are predisposed to slanted judgement, 2% of experiment seem to have genuine preternatural senses and or abilities, being that they are above chance.  While the findings will please believers in the paranormal, they are not enough to convince the skeptics.  Like it ever is. 2% is simply not enough for a case. It is worth noting though that that 2% is constant through out all time periods, and different types of research. :-) As the articles I have found on this topic do not specify, I can not tell you if these experiments involved multiple subjects or if they met the decline effect.  I apologise for the detailed description, but experiments require a good explanation.   *RFID update* a bill in California that would have forced companies to label products with RFID chips in them was defeated yesterday.
