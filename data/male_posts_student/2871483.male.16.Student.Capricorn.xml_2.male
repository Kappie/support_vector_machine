Here we are, spending our hard earned money for taxes, taxes which go to programs like welfare, promoting the American way of life (sucking the blood outta the guys who've got cash!)   Though the concept is novel, people out there are vampires! Though I don't think that we should totally wipe it off of the face of the USA, much like a smudge on the face of a hugely fat baby, there needs to be definite change.    I'll be first to admit it, and I don't know much about the program, besides that it hands out money and food stamps (do they still have those?) to lazy-ass "citizens" who do nothing but drink booze and have babies, so they can get more welfare! Though I'm sure there is a silent minority that actually needs it, like families on hard times, there is the overly disgusting majority (I think it's a majority) that suck our blood and wallets  dry , just living off it!    What I want to see are stricter time limits, huge background checks, and checks on the recipients that come often, to look at progress. The program probably has these already, not too sure, but if they do, I'm thinking they aren't strict enough!    Correct me if I am wrong on any of these facts! Let's see some blood spilt!
