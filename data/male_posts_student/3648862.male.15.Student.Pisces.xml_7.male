Well anyway, she asked me what my reaction would be if she wrote me a letter that said "I love Ryan" all over it. I told her I would shoot her. I was being sarcastic, obviously. I think she is just trying to get back at me for being gay. I hate her guts, I should have never told her anything.    I have told two people ever, Kym and a girl named Beth. Beth was the reason I stopped dating girls. I hated kissing girls and I knew that if I went out with her I would have to kiss her. Well we got really close, and then my friend Mike showed up in the middle. I was in love with him at the time. At this time I told Beth I was gay, and she decided that sense she couldn't have me she would go out with Mike. She got really close to kissing him but stopped for my sake. She also told Mike I was gay, and Mike told a lot of people. Now I had to deny everything I told her. I also was forced to go out with her to keep her away from Mike. It didn't work out to well, three days after we started going out she cheated on me with Mike. We then broke up the following day.    After that Kym thought that she would try to go out with me. I then told her that I was gay and that I was in love with Ryan. Even though I told her she still wont get over me. Well since she told me that she likes Ryan today, I think I will ignore her. That will make her real mad.   Other than that there isn't that much going on. I helped my dad build a Horseshoe game pit...thing...whatever you call it. It started to rain and I got soaked and really muddy. I don't even like horseshoes, so why are we building it? I guess so we can spend more quality time together, it sounds like so much fun. I found out what it's called. It's a backyard horseshoe court, oh boy it sounds fancy. I have my last final tomorrow, I am very happy. It's earth science which is my best subject. It's also a three hour long test which really blows. Well that's all for now. TTYL
