Needless to say, I enjoyed it a great deal, and am off to see it again tomorrow morning (or rather, later this morning, as I am writing this at around 2:30 a.m.) I'm not going to sit here and try to write a review of it. I certainly am no movie critic, and am not about to try and critique it on its merits as a film. Similarly, I am not some unbiased fact checker who's going to go through every single point the movie makes and confirm or dispute their validity. I am an unabashed, anti-war, anti-Bush, liberal Democrat, and this film was an exhortation for me and all who share my views. Yet this is not to contest the movie's truthfulness - I (not surprisingly) believe virtually every word of it. I fully accept the fact that Michael Moore is preaching to his own choir, and I  admitedly count myself as being among those who take his words for the Gospel. This is not because he's swaying me one way or another, but because he is speaking what I fully, completely believe to be true. If this makes me a fanatic of sorts, then so be it. If this blinds me, and robs me of some other "perspective", then so be it. I don't care. I no longer could give a damn about the intellectual banter, the issue-by-issue analysis, the cerebral commentary that I once held to be so dear. I sit in front of my TV screen every day, watching the horrific pictures that pour out of the Middle East: burnt-out shells of humvees, Iraqi children and American soldiers missing limbs, blindfolded westerners about to be decapitated. I don't want perspective. I want peace.  But who knows? Maybe I'll be proved wrong someday, when Iraq is a (*chortle*) thriving, liberal democracy, abuzz with free market commerce and open political debate, and those missing WMD are found in a hole out in the desert somewhere. Maybe George W. Bush will go down as the heroic leader who stood up for the inherent virtues of democracy when the rest of the world cynically opposed him. Maybe the people like me will be thrown on Ronald Reagan's proverbial ash heap of history, thoroughly discredited along with the communists and isolationists.  But I strongly, strongly doubt it.
