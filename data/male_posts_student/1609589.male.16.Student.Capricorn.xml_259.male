Boy, I thought they were lying when they said that aloneness was terrible. I never believed them. It gets to the point where you're confused of what day it is... what time it is... you realize it's 3 in the morning when you could have sworn it was only 7 in the evening.  Yeah, i feel... alone. Whatever. Noone wants to do anything, anyway. Everybody won't get off the topic of girlfriends and love life and stuff, and it's not like i feel left out, I know the torment and pain it brings people, but...  I just try and make things better for other people. There, I guess that's a good enough explanation. I try and make other people's lives a little bit happier, because- who knows- they could be going through a horrible trauma, their family could have burned to death in a fire... they failed their first math test in 7 years... whatever. I guess that's  my  meaning of life- for those who I feel deserve it, they should be brought all the joy that can possibly be given.  Sure, I have views. I post them here. You should know that by now. I try and fool myself and say that this is for my "personal records," and for me, just public for other people to look at, bullshit. I try to write stuff so people will laugh, and go "Hey, that was funny, I needed that" before going back to whatever it was they were doing.  I suppose this "love" stuff isn't for me yet- i know that I'm an ugly shit and that there isn't much I can do about it.  Why am I complaining? I have a good life. I have a nice house, good parents, a brother who I can, for the most part, tolerate. But the planes of the physical, and those of the emotional are far different.  You people always have one question on your minds- "Who do you like?" Well, since you seem to have no respect for other people's privacy, I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of knowing. It's not like I had an answer anyway. I decided that it was futile to decide something of which I had no knowledge of the outcome.  Aaah! Crap! Self pity post! Bad, bad self! ~hits self in head multiple times~  ~looks back over post~ Hmm, I suppose most of that is true. Meh.
