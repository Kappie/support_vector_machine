Oh, and my comics(Penny Arcade, PVP, 8-Bit Theatre, Sluggy, Ctrl-Alt-Del). I most likely did that for an hour or so before getting breakfast and checking Utopia(an incredibly geekish game that embarrasses me just to mention).  I can't remember when, but at some point I must've had the ludicrous idea of starting a blog. In general, these appeal to me because of their technological sophistication and ease-of-use; I've tried livejournal and browsed through xanga, but I must say that I was most impressed with Blogger. The styles, the XHTML customization, the timestamp settings; classy and usable.  So I set up my blog and decided the purpose of it: to log the day's events in the case of my memory failing me(which does happen - quite often, in fact). So, the point of this, as mentioned before, is to record my history. I plan to update it at most once a day, as I've stated, all through-out grade 11.  That said, I played some Starscape, Slide Swords, and Crimsonland throughout the day. None of them amused me for long, but Crimsonland was by far the most enjoyable, even after all this time. Since it is rather late now you'll noticed my chronological sense is rather skewed; like events are grouped together.  I took the dog for a short walk at around 1:30, and then went to buy two Cokes from the local Blockbuster, since they have a deal and all. I took the bike we keep near the backdoor that our Japanese exchange student uses to get to school. When I got back I made some sammiches. Or sandwiches. Both are acceptable in my vernacular, although the former is more amusing to say. They were tasty, in any case.  So that passed some time. I got a call from Sarah(from England, who was at CCW and Sun Camp with me) and she told me that Julia, Elizabeth, and herself were trying to find out about the after-party for CCW. I knew relatively nothing and was little help. However, they called a bit later to inform me that I was invited to a party over at Julia's house, going from 7 to 11. I was cool with that, and agreed to join them at the specified time.  In the meanwhile I set about working on the basic designs for my web-comic. I didn't really accomplish much, but I did have fun designing some characters(rather badly, I'll admit). Hopefully I'll have more time to work on it after I finish my work for English 10. My art really needs sharpening, after all.  I had a quick pasta dinner before setting off to the party; a fair amount of CCW were there, plus Regan(pronounced ree-gan; she's a she). We had Will, Pete, James, Ben, Trevor, Elizabeth, Julia, Sarah, Max, Adam, Lucien, and I. I didn't expect much out of this party really, since it was at Julia's house and her mom is rather conservative. In short: no drugs or booze. Which was fine, anyways; I didn't really feel like getting wasted.  We played spin the bottle, Twister, truth or dare, whatever. The dares were rather amusing, actually; lap dances and othersuch nonsense was administered in a quite liberal manner. My favourite part of the party, however, was constantly hitting on Elizabeth - she's my ex from when I was twelve or so, and she got  hot . I would've hit on her more during CCW/Sun Camp, but she's currently infatuated(quite adorably, really) with an RoW of the same name as I. He'll be gone soon enough, though, and I figure I might have a chance. She's really beautiful, and easy to hang out with. She's always laughing or smiling, something that I find immensely appealing.  Anyways, that about covers it for the night. I might edit in some things that I forgot tomorrow, but I think that that is unlikely. Anyways, the rest of the day will go as follows: brush teeth, perhaps look at some sites, do a couple of sit-ups and push-ups, read a bit, sleep.  That is a ridiculous amount for me to write, but I suppose it was a rather eventful day. And I  am  being more open and explanatory than I usually am. Looks like those writing skills will be easier to improve than I thought?
