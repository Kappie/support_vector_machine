Instrumental intro to "Venus" >  Sugar, ah honey honey You are my candy girl and you got me wantin' you Honey, ah sugar sugar You are my candy girl and you got me wantin' you  1- 2- 3- 4  This happened once before when I came to your door No reply They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peak through your window  You know, if you break my heart I'll go But I'll be back again 'Cause I told you once before goodbye But I came back again  Asked the girl what she wanted to be She said "Baby, can't you see?" "I want to be famous, the star of the screen" But you can do something in between... Baby, you can drive my car Yes, I'm gonna be a star Baby, you can drive my car And baby I love you  Listen, do you want to know a secret Do you promise not to tell Wo-ah, closer Let me whisper in your ear Say the words you love to hear "I'm in love with you" woo-oo  Try to see it my way Do I have to keep on talkin' till I couldn't go on While you see it your way Run the risk of knowing that our love might soon be gone We can work it out We can work it out  I should have known better with a girl like you That I would love everything that you do And I do, hey-hey-hey  He's a real nowhere man Sitting in his nowhere land  You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes you're gonna lose that girl) You're gonna lo-se that, yeah (Yes, yes you're gonna lose that girl) You're gonna lo-se that girl (Yes, yes you're gonna lose that girl)  Ooooo... Ooooo...  The "Stars on 45" keeps on turning in your mind Like "We Can Work it Out"  Remember "Twist and Shout" "You Still Don't Tell Me Why" and  "No Reply"  Ooooo... Ooooo...        Wow, I like that song!!
