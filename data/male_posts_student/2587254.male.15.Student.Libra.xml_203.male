Yeah today was pretty cool, after church had Gavin and Calvin over for BBQ, and then Jason came too for some ball at the park and then an afternoon of PS2 and then topped off with Pizza dinner and of course just the jokes and stupid things we made up during the time they were over today. Good times though, haha like usual eventually we all got bored and just kinda sat in front of the TV.  My day started off at the usual 830am today, jumping out of bed, get dressed, eat, bathroom, and then off I went to church. Only had to pick up Lina today since Jason had just got back from Montreal, so he was a bit tired. Got to church around 910ish or so, and Theresa was in place for Thomas for teaching us during Bible Study today. So we did a study on Daniel 5 today, which spoke of Belshezzar's ignorance of God, and eventually dying for it. He was warned before, as he witnessed Nebuchadnezzar's exile, but he still didn't care, and long story short, God literally "pwned" him =P. Darius of the Medes then took over half of Babylon, and some other country took over the other half. Yup, one thing that I've always enjoyed about the Bible are the stories about the ancient battles and stuff. Just picturing it in my mind like a mental version of "Troy" or "Gladiator..." ahh yes it really does bring stories to life. So we did a study on the fall of Belshazzar basically today *the hand writing on the wall happened in this chapter also* and then up to service we went.  Sermon today I read the scripture for, and was preached by Pastor Ming Wong since Pastor Kwong was out and so was Mackness. He spoke a good sermon though. It was a good reminder of how we should be living our lives according to God, and not according to us. He reminded us of how we should ask God what our purpose here on earth is, instead of trying to figure it out on our own. We should be consulting God on whatever problems we have, and not trying to solve it ourselves. And most of all, we should be asking God to lead us through life, as walking aimlessly on our own is like walking with no purpose.  After the service, Calvin and Gavin came to my place for some BBQ.  Had some Ju-Pah, and I tried some BBQ fish that my dad made which wasn't bad, and then Jason came over also. So we played some PS2, chilled, and we even managed to fit in an hour of ball in the scorching 30 degree weather today *I mean celsius not fahrenheit.* And as mentioned before jokes jokes and more jokes haha.  Example. Since it waas 30 degrees, we got pretty tired from balling, but in a last effort ditch to play, we decided to finish off our ballin' with a game of "American 5." Yeah....that was one thing that happened today that was seeing us at our most retarded stage. NBA street was actually pretty funny also, especially when Calvin forgets everything we tell him 2 minutes later. He reminds me of Fighter from  urlLink Nuklear Power . Good times though still haha. All of us had our share of stupidity. Calvin had to leave at 6pm, but Gavin and Jason stayed until about 830-9ish. Jason left a bit earlier, so that is why I have a time span.  On the PS2 today, I almost forgot to mention, some of the most b/s stuff happened. NFL Street Calvin manages to make a last dying pitch to a fellow player to score a touchdown *it was a b/s pitch,* Gavin SOMEHOW made a defensive conversion, and in NBA Street I don't see how Jason ACCIDENTALLY scored with NELLY from  BEYOND HALF COURT. *  So yeah even though no jamming happened today, we still had chillin' times.  On a side note of goodnews, Rebecca is back from Winnepeg, and Jason as you have realized is back from Montreal.  As I think now still, so many jokes were made today or talked about. The Grill shirt that Jason saw in Monreal *a Nike shirt that actually had a grill on it and said "all up in your grill" or Gavin's woman shot in ball haha. There was also the joke about American 21, and whole bunch of other stuff.  And to leave you people with some famous quotes made today:  Calvin...  "What's a dunk to a layup?" "Uhh, how do you do a layup and a slam dunk at the same time?" "Pump fake? What's that?"  Joe...  "Hey you know how we have SMPGO instead of LMAO? Well for "lmfao" we could have SMCHPGO! SIUING MY CHO HAO PEI GOO OFF!" "COME ON BRING IT AMERICAN 21 IT YOU HOES!" "Haha Wein almost spells Weiner..."  Jason...  *He made a half court shot with Nelly in NBA Street, so that says enough...OH YEAH I REMEMBER SOMETHIN'...* "Calvin, you can dunk and lay-up at the same time FOR SURE. All you have to do is dunk it, and then quickly catch the ball and throw it again before landing...got it?"  Gavin...  *Cracks up from the American 21 hoe comment* "GUY I CAN'T DUNK IT WON'T LET ME!" "OWNED! OOOOOH SIU!"   Bah I'm runnin' outta ideas. Gonna head to sleep I think haha.  Later.
