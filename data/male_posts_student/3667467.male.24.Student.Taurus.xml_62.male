On her side of the family, she had a grandfather named Fred that died right before her and my father were married. She also has a brother named Fred. BUT, and this was the point she emphasized TWICE in the conversation, her mother's nickname is "Fred" as well. Yes. Grandma's real name is Catherine (coincidentally, my sister's middle name) but those her age apparently call her Fred as a gesture of compassion and friendly jesting. Let me reiterate: I have a Grandma Fred. The genes are strong enough to perpetuate the family line. Aren't you worried about this? Do you understand the implications? These people are breeding!!
