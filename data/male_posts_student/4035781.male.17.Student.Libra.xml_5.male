Who knew sharing the words containing my beliefs could bring about such times. I live true to myself, I will walk the path of fire if need be. Not everyone is as such, some would merely walk the path of fire for the sake of walking the path. Most people don't want to be hurt, nor do I. Of course I am talking of mental pain, physical pain is but a candle held to the sun compared to mental anguish. I don't like seeing my loved ones hurt, it hurts me in turn.  D
