(Shown at the end of the first film, but never identified.) At the same time, a CIA group is covertly attempting to purchase evidence that a mole inside the Agency stole $20 million in funds; an assassin shows up, kills both the CIA buyer and the seller, steals $3 million in US cash and the files; he then plants a fingerprint of Bourne's. The assassin then goes to India and attempts to kill Bourne. The chase is on, with the CIA hunting Bourne, and Bourne hunting the CIA trying to find out why and more about his past. (He still doesn't know everything about himself, but remembers small bits here and there.)  Thankfully, the movie doesn't follow the second book at all; after the Bourne Identity, the Bourne novels by Ludlum got real boring and repetitive... Similar to how Tom Clancy nearly ran the Jack Ryan franchise into the ground. Matt Damon delivers another wonderful performance as Bourne, and Brian Cox, returning as the former head of Bourne's CIA black-ops squad, delivers a wonderful performance as well. The movie progresses very rapidly, and they fit a lot of story into a short time. I won't say much more, because to do so would risk revealing the plot. The action scenes were very well scripted, and on the whole, the movie is very solid.   The ending is very similar to the first movie: it can serve as either an end to the series, or as the opening to a third movie. Damon has said that he doesn't feel a need to do a third film, because he doesn't like sequels made "just to make money"; but if they made another script that was equal to, or better, than the first two, he'd strongly consider it.   You've got to love an actor who says things like that. And in my (humble) opinion, I'd like to go on record as predicting the following: If this movie does well, and "professional" reviews are good, you can bet Universal will have writers working hard to make a strong follow-up. And if they make it right, Damon will sign on for a third film. However, I'm with Damon on this one: they should make it ONLY if it lives up to the first two; otherwise, leave it alone. However, the ending of this movie is such that it begs... no, screams for a sequel. Here's to hoping the Bourne Supremacy does well, so that a third and final chapter can be scripted.
