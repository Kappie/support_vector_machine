The trip to KL with the State Foundation is not exactly pleasant, too many hiccups here and there. Delayed bus, filthy room at UKM (my school's hostel is much better). Have a session with the Dean Faculty of Education on Tuesday morning before having a quick tour of UKM. Then off we went to Multimedia University in Cyberjaya. Their facilities are impressive such as the library and E-Gallery. A real bummer, the air-con not working due to maintainance and  black-out  during briefing in the lecture hall. Then I think I had enough, called my auntie to pick me up at Putra Mosque, the next stop. Nice timing, I arrived there just when my auntie is about to park her car. Quickly I unload my stuffs from the bus into the car. Off I went to Bangi, safe and sound. Whereas my friends had their trip to PM's Residence cancelled, trapped in traffic jam, their buses broke down and only reached Kuantan at midnight. Pity them, I just lounge around at Bangi while they face those mishaps. Wednesday afternoon my parents picked me up and visit the National Museum with my cousins. Didn't see the main exhibition, just went to the Exotic Cats  Birds Display and Gold Heritage Display. Quite interesting, different from the usual display. At night went to Mid Valley Megamall for dinner. Bye for now, pictures later.
