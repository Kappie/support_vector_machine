One that I have pondered in great depth is the existence and nature of justice. Some would believe that no matter what our court systems produce in the way of sentencing, there still remains the great pillar of fire in the sky, or the burning bush or some carpenter's kid who at the end of the day will pronounce judgement on us all. While I don't proclaim to have any more insight into this particular topic than say, The Pope(tm) or perhaps the Queen of England(tm) I do believe I've found an example that yes, there is such a thing as justice, yes, there is a God(tm), and yes, s/he has one fucking hilarious sense of humour, not to mention a  urlLink love for animals.   Why, of why God(tm), can't I live in London and have a  urlLink spare Fifteen thousand pounds?
