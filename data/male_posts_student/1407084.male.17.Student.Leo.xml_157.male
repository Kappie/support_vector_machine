Maybe we will eat at some really cool restuarant, just maybe..  I purchased Grease last night.. that movie, as well as the play(I hope we do it next year) kicks major ass. I'm glad Henry Winkler wasn't cast as Danny Zuco.. that would have been just.. just.. I can't even think about it, it would have been so bad. He looks the part, but he's got nothin', and i mean NOTHING, on John Travolta.
