After tennis I get home and watch TV thats why i was considering naming all the chapters boring and then naming the weekend chapters semi-boring and the holidays would be exceptions. School was ok i supose except we had a boring maths test in the 1st and 2nd periods in which mr.Arayne persisted to blame me for talking to other students when i didnt! In fact when he doesnt say anything im usually doing exactly that.  Friday 29/7 2004 Chapter 3: Northern lights is boring!  Today we did sex ed and i had to listen to peter giggling through the whole thing. I meen how was i suposed to know that an osama style beard wasnt normal for a mans facial hair and so i drew it on the sheet and it looked really stupid...JUST LIKE OSAMA BIN LADEN!but seriously though bagging terrorists is the cheepest form of comedy there is because its so easy. They all look so stupid if you just show the audience a picture of one they'll kack there pants and another one is poo jokes. All you have to do is say a definition of poo in a funny voice or in a sentence with terrorists and the audience will bring the joke to life! (kack themselves once more)Period 3+4 were good though i just downloaded music and movies from the computers the whole time while the teacher delt with the trouble makers, which would normally meen me but im not stupid enough to get in trouble in a computer class. And the rest of the day was boring. On the tram home i realised that northern lights is boring and im just gonna listen to the cassette tapes from now on.Im so over books they suck. And so ends the 3rd boring day of my boring blog.  Saturday 30/7 2004 chapter 4: workin at the shop  Today im working at the toy shop which is what i'v been doing every Saturday for about a year and a half.  My job is basically to price new stock, stack shelves, work at the register and to entertain my boses baby usually with hide and seek but he always wins because he always go's under the shelves and suprises me and yeh i know its kinda stupid loosing to a 15 month old baby in a game of hide and seek but he really is good at it. Today during work some kids came into the shop trying to steel stuff so my boss told me to wait at the door and get them to turn out there pocketsI felt like a bouncer or something. They started crying because they didnt want us to tell there parents what they'd done i kinda felt sorry for them but we told there parents and they came in with a bag of stuff that there kids had stolen over the last few months and they said sorry and blah blah blah and they weren't going to do it again. how dramatic.....NOT! well at least im living up to my boring blog standards eh? After work i went to Christo's b'day party which i was supposed to be dressed as Quote: a dark knite or an evil night dwelling beast :unquote. But i wasnt in the mood for embarissing myself with nerdy costumes so i just went casual.  when i got there they were playing with swords in the front yard.........ok these are the kids that i would have bashed if i was a bully in primary school, so i started playing cricket with my sword using a toy goblins head for a ball and they got pissed at me because I hit it really hard out onto Hope street and a car ran over it,i laughed but afterwards i found out it was a piece of 'Warhammer' and that little piece of plastic was worth about $30 so i left...Fewf!  AFTER THIS ABNORMALLY NERDY PARTY I REALISED WHY PEOPLE BAG ME FOR PLAYING WITH YUGIOH CARDS AND IM REALLY DISCOURAGED FROM THEM NOW, I THINK I'LL SELL THEM. THIS IS CAPTAIN TOMARSE OF THE QUANTUM GALAXY NERD PATROL SIGNING OFF!... BECAUSE IM BORED!  Sunday 1/8 2004 chapter 5:Go the bombers!  Last night the mighty Essendon bombers conquered Port Adelaide in a really great game of footy! the bombers started to slip away in the last quarter but then ran away with it in the end by about 32 points. speakin of run away thats what i felt like doing on friday night when Adelaide and the Kangaroos stank out the southern hemisphere with there incredible show of cheapness, I meen i haven't seen a worse game of footy in more than 3 years and i was watching StKilda 2 years ago! only 2 goals in the 1st half of the game! thats shocking. im really tired today so im gonna sleep,watch footy and write some blogging you wanna know why im so tired...well i'll to ya anyway! i stayed up to watch the late late movie on channel 9 last night and thats no typo it was later than the late movie! in fact it went in this order: the late movie, the late show with David Letterman and then the late late movie and i drank loads of coffee so i could stay up and watch it (even though it wasnt that good i was just bored) and my hands were shakin like crazy it was like a Playstation controller when you get shot in Medal of Honor (i dont expect many of you to understand that) and thats all folks! the end of Bugs bunnys 4th blog chapter!  Monday 2/8 2004 Chapter 6 : damn school make me do work!  Monday...Damn back to boring school, thats what i hate about weekends... they end! And i bet anyone who's reading this is nodding and saying something like "yeh tell me something i dont know" or "school is were i would kill myself if i was suicidal". Today was a pretty lowsy day because i felt like playing sport or running around and that didnt happen, first the boring maths test,then the double science "boredom 101"yawwwnnn! but I cant really say anything bad about english for two reasons one is that Ms Rose will read this and two because it wasnt that bad, but Sose wow that sucked even though we only had to sit through 35 minutes of it because everyone took it upon themselves to be late (including myself) but the lesson was just a half hour discussion about why we are willingly late. But the rest of the day was ok because me and Lachlan decided to show up at bens house and play gamecube for a few hours until Ben kicked us out. Thats about it. Well im sorry my life isnt more interesting but im doing the best i can ok!!!oh and im making it trdition to mention the word "Boring' in every outro so in closing this was just another boring day in the life of BOB um i meen Tom...Damn you figured out my Alias NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! oh wait i can erase that cant i here ill try this button here it says "publish post" maybe that will delete my stupidity??? hey wait why am i writing my thoughts??? oh well atleast publish post will delete it all.  tuesday 3/8 2004 chapter 7: I know that last joke seems retarded but there was nothing else in my small brain.  Im a terrible comedian not even GMA could hire me now and there pretty lame! Today was another horrible day except for perhaps Lachlans entertaining sose presentation which consisted of micheal Jackson impressions, Frysey impressions and not much intelingent information at all oh and science was a fun lesson (only because the teacher was absent!) we just talked, read books and some people looked at photos of rachels thighes on Rebeccas picture phone...dont ask why because im stumped. On the whole this day was kinda crappy, but after school i went with Frank, Liam,ian,the other Liam and this girl that tagged along to the milk bar and it was my shout...That isnt so bad i spose i do have pretty deep pockets and im the only one with a job at the moment so its pretty fair. This is Uncle Tomby saying THE END....WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GO HOME! YOU DAMN LONERZ!...lol. Chapter 8 the epic adventure of the century...coming soon!
