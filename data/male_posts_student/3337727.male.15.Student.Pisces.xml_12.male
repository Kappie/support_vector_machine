I truely loved Nat, and when she turned me away, I tried to recapture that feeling of love I've felt for her. Often emotions would get in the way, and I'd get into a bunch of quick relationships that end in heartbreak. That's exactly what it is. I want to actually, honestly love a girl, like I've loved Nat.   I've been hurting every day about this, and really haven't said anything. Just keeping quiet except for a few times, usually looking for a new girl to rush into a relationship with, in hopes of finally falling in love again. I swear love is a drug, and it's something I've been addicted to since I fell for Nat.  As soon as I met Nat, I became this romantic, always writing romance stories and everything about love...I always wanted to live out those stories but it's impossible.  Nat says my biggest mistake is me going with all these girls..but she's the reason why I'm doing it. I swear to God I wouldn't be going through girls like this or being so attached if I had never been in love before. So it's a never ending cycle until I find a girl to love....but I ALWAYS rush things, because I want to feel love as quickly as possible.  Basically, I'm screwed. I can't get love out of my head, and I'm just going to keep hurting, and hurting, and hurting...nice to know that my first love ended up being the biggest mistake of my love life.
