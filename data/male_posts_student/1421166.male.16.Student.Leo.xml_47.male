Perhaps that's why I'm often bias against Lana (sorry to lotsa people...hehe). I can often imagine myself in a scenario like hers, then there'll always be funny things to do. Like reading a confession letter, when the other person is unconcious. (thought of that, but haven't got the chance...oops...), then things like sitting in front of the computer attempting to delete pictures. Well, at least I managed to delete everything instead of keeping then in my recycle bin. I seldom show my real feelings...hmm...well, maybe. Guess that's what everybody else thinks right? Me, always seemingly happy and chirpy. I should have more confidence. The only problem is that I don't have anything to be confident in. And not to forget the fact that I ain't intelligent or beautiful...haha!
