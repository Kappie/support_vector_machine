Anyway, a new poem I've got:  The Writer of Poems, with himself would sit,  Until his work was full of wit.  Though never able to make of it,  That single greatness we all need.   In that room with somber eyes,  He left a breath of worthy cries,  And never thought to realize  That he will not succeed.   His life was left to be so grim,  Waiting for muses to come to him,  And beckon to his every whim,  Until he did his deed.   A single candle showed the light,  And helped The Writer in the night,  But never gave the gift of sight,  To those too blind to read.   The only muse that ever came,  A tiny moth too small for shame,  Was taken by the guiding flame,  More than willing to feed.   This single moth showed the strife,  Of every writer's lowly life.  And The Writer of Poems took his knife,  And made his poems bleed.   In that dirty, placid room,  Full of dark, and shaded gloom,  One can find his resting tomb,  Full of shameful greed.
