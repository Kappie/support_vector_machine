I've heard a few non-partisans here at work talking about things, and generally I stay out of them because it just isn't worth it to stir it up here.  Maybe I should change that policy.  In short, it seems that ANY criticism of one group leveled by another group is immediately ignored as 'partisan', despite the facts involved - unless the charges are echoed by the media, in which case they stick.  For example, the conventional wisdom here is that Bush DID know things were moving forward, and he SHOULD have done more to stop the attacks.  At the same time, any statement that the previous administration had maintained a weak policy is simply sour grapes.  Despite the fact that we had the Cole bombing (no response), the 1993 WTC bombing (no response), at least two offers to hand over Bin Laden by the Sudanese (no response) and so on.  Those FACTS don't matter.  Because the charges have been leveled by the Right, they are dismissed as 'politics'.    I'm not saying 9/11 is Clinton's fault, but I am saying that the policies pursued before 9/11 were weak and contributed to the attacks, and those policies go all the way back through the first Bush, Reagan, Carter and Ford.  Remember the Munich Olympics?  We did nothing then either.  Non-Partisans need to take the time to really understand what's going on before they simply scoff: "it's just politics".  There are FACTS here that must be examined.  In a quote I read this morning, the late Senator Moynihan said: "You're entitled to your own opinion.  You're not entitled to your own facts."
