I went on my first loop today. It was scary, and I've got fucking bad whiplash, but I'm Ok. I think. Hell's Gate is so scary, you get in this big tube thing and you spin and turn and oh shit, it's scary! Oh shit, that's the name of one of my 3 cactai, Ouch, Arrrgh! and Oh Shit! I named them after what I said after touching their spikes for the first time. They like to soak up the sun in my room. Ah bless...........Ouch! Arrgh! Oh Shit! It was dark once and I went through my room, almost tripped on the crap on the floor and landed on them. I mainly got Arrrgh!ed, as he (or she)'s the tallest. Ouch is a normal castus, tall and straight (Like me :) ) Arrgh is taller than Ouch and his (or her) spikes are surrounded with soft fluff. Oh Shit is a big yellow flower with killer inch-long spikes hidden underneath (you can imagine why I said 'Oh Shit'). I don't favor any of them anymore than any other flower or plant, but I love them, awwww......Ouch! Arrgh! Oh, Shit!
