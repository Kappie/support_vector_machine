I try to live my life for me, but obviously what I do isn't enough for everyone else. Everyone else finds faults in the way I am. Well you know what!? FUCK YOU! If you've got a fucking problem with me, then too fucking bad. I live my life for  ME  and only  ME!  Need some examples of who fucks with me? Well lets see... there's Grimes and his cousin. Well, that didn't really get me going, but it just added fuel to this lil rant here. There's Sylvie, my Ex...She acts like everything I fucking do is her business. Well I've got news for ya, BITCH, IT'S NOT! Can't you understand that you have nothing to do with me now!? One more thing about the fuckers who think that they can come into my life, and be a part, tell me to do things, and fuck with my heart, guess what, YOU CAN'T! You always try to alter my moods, or stop me from doing things you don't want me to do, bitch. I keep to myself, what the hell did I ever do to get your attention? Do something that's going to keep your life from being 'perfect'? Well you go and peruse your little slice of 'perfect' and I'll sit, and wait for you to find it. And once you do, I'm sure as hell, going to fuck things up ten times worse then anything you ever did to fuck with me!
