A couple days ago I started thinking about how to best describe wushu flavor.  Well, when I think about wushu flavor, I think about two things: rhythm and flow.  Two entirely separate things, almost.  I don't claim to be an expert in either of these, probably barely an amateur at both, but I'm writing this post to help me clearly analyze each of these aspects.  First, when you think of rhythm what is the first thing you think of?  Probably music, huh?  That's what I think about anyway.  Rhythm in music is ver similar to rhythm in wushu, I think.  You have to know when to go fast when to go slow.  You have to know where to add that extra boost of speed for effect and when to dramatically slow to build up suspense.  Recently, after doing some deep thinking about flavor, I've tried to think of a song while doing wushu.  I think of the fast part of the song and I'm doing a fast part of my form and try to move according to the songs rhythem.  When I need to go slow, I think of a slow part.  I admit that my rhythm is pretty terrible, but I think this method helps me to apply rhythm to my wushu.  Second, flow.  I don't know about you but when I think of flow the first thing I think about is waves.  If you've ever watched the waves come in you probably know what I'm talking about.  The waves combine perfectly power, with speed, with the ultimate non-stop flow.  Everything moves as one. Nothing stops moving, it's just constant flowing motion.  I'm not sure how to explain it, but I kind of try to copy the waves.  Sounds stupid, but that's just me.  I try to copy the constant flowing motion, the movement as one, trying to create that same ultimate non-stop flow of the waves.  I'm not sure if this helps anyone, but if it does, that's just a bonus because I, myself, have learned a lot from posting this.  Well, all my secrets are out.  Know it's time to start practicing what I preach.  You're probably wondering why I make such a big deal of something as small as flavor.  The reason I make such a big deal is that I can't make my form super powerful or fast so I need to have something to distinguish it, something to make a noticable difference from my form and other peoples' forms.  - Some loser
