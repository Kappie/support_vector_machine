I'm going back to Norman tomorrow, which is a nice thing, because I'm ready to have my own space, things, timing, etc.  I like to be able to do what I want, when I want, oh and have my own car.  Speaking of Norman, I just saw a MORMON commercial.  (they rhymed).  Somehow it always comes back to the mormons.  The advertisement was for the bible, it's a best seller u know, but anyway.  They mentioned NOTHING of the "book of Mormon" which tells me that once u call the number and get the free bible, as if you can't get one in EVERY nightstand across America (thank you Guidions).  That's beside the point, however, back to the commercial.  They mentioned nothing of the Book of Mormon, doesn't that seem odd to you?  It does to me, because you know that some poor sucker is going to get a package in the mail and AH HA!  Low and behold, there's an extra book.  An addendum, if you will, to the written and spoken word of God.  A memo to man, about a giant lake of salt, and something related to Utah.  Gosh, they'd be hard pressed to get me to read that book, seeing as how I can't get myself to read ANY book.  "Marketing Management" was the last book I read, and NOT by choice.  Thanks Professor Hobbs.  I'm watching Family feud on the Game Show Network, which is quite possibly one of the greatest game shows ever.  ENTIRE families of people get together for one cause, to guess survey answers and win some cash and prizes.  My family has a hard time uniting on a decision for dinner, let alone "What is the most common New Years Resolution."  By the way that WAS a question just now, and this jackass just said "Save money?"  SERIOUSLY dude, everyone knows that it is "loose weight."  P.S.- the number one answer WAS loose weight, thank you very much.  Where was I when the Wezigowitz family from Topeka, KS needed me?  Oh, I was in the womb, cause this show was filmed in 1980.  I can't believe it's already been three weeks of being back home.  I'm quite ready to get back to my own routine, but not exactly thrilled about the scholastic endeavors I will be participating in.  I will comfort myself in knowing that I only have THREE classes left to take in college, ever.  Somehow that doesn't help the stinging reality that I will more than likely be in school three more years for law.  Still, though, it's exciting to be almost finished.    Oh look, one hour and counting until I have to leave to go to Church on a Saturday night.  WEEE!  Trust me, I could be a LOT more bitter.  I literally just deleted my previous entry, as it was too bitter for posting.  KICKASS, another episode of the FAMILY FEUD.  How irritating- it's not the original, or the most recent, it's some very strange 1989 version.  There are LOTS of shoulder pads present, and bad haircuts.  Most importantly, though, is of course that there is LOTS of cheesy expressions.  When you introduce your family on this show, you apparently have to have an adjective in front of their name.  "Next to me is my LOVELY sister Sheila.  Then my great brother John, and my fatty wife Brenda.."  Well none of them said fatty, but wouldn't that be more fun?  I think so.  On a final note, 8 of the schools I applied to, have now requested my file from LSDAS.  They all will request it eventually, but it's just scary to think that all of this is in the works, and they're getting my information and files processed.  SCURRY.
