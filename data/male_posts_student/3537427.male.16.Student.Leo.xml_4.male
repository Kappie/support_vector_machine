I have a cousin named Joe, so thats kind of sick.) but then I realized that it was 6:20. I dont have to do anything until 10. Why do I do this to myself?  I guess there is a good thing about being awake this early, I just havent figured out what it is yet. I've already been up too long to go back to bed, and I'm not awake enough to stay up.  Well today shouldn't be too bad. I only have an hour and like 15 minutes of school. That should take until...11:30-45 for me to get home. then I have the rest of the day up to 5 to do what ever I want.Which will most likely be talking online, and listening to music.  And then theres always good ol' work. Never a dull moment at work, except when no one is there.Oh well, I'm workin with stuart tonight so it shouldn't be too bad, although, I'd much rather work with Thomas(he's more fun)  That should be about enough for now...  Last time I checked, I was still ...Ryan...
