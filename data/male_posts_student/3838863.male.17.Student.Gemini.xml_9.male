Its one of the few i nvr regret attending. =P Women = Dogs in Paskistan. I mean literally. I also learnt that the brutal killings were long b4 Islam was introduced to the country. And it became the scapegoat of the brutal killings. Illterate religious leaders taught from the Quran. What a culture.. Hhhmm..  After that, studied with Weichong till about 9pm. Had some arm-wrestling game with him. It was a draw! =PpPPPpp My left arm is stronger, his weaker. His right arm stronger, mine weaker. But he doesn't really care about who wins. He only cares about .............. lolx~ i've learnt my lesson. Not gonna leak any secret while blogging. =P  Had a great time scaring each other with ghost stories. He keep persuading me to join hockey. Donno how much the coach bribed him. lolx~ Oh ya. he enjoyed 'the eye' very much too. Sobx. missing Jerome..  Gonna do some hmwk. JC life = No life Adios~
