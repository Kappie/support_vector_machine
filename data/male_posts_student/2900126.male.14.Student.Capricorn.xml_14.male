So over all I had a good day. The only thing that brought me down was thinking about one of my friends ( who shall remain nameless) who is like changing because of this guy she likes and she always ditches me and her other friends just so she can walk home with him. The thing about it is she like spend every waking moment with him. For some reason she calls me all these names and it really irritates me and she knows that but the thing that makes the angriest is when she says these things, she knows it ticks me off, she continues to do it, and now most of the school thinks I am what she said I was becasue of a rumor that started. One of her friends or cousins or who ever beats on me everytime I go to the guy she likes ( who is also my friend) house and she does nothing about it. Then she will share thing with the guy and when I ask her she will be like " no" and I say "Why??" and she'll say "because I hate you" or she will bring up something that happened in the past for a reason not to share with me. Speaking of sharing she knows that most of the time I don't have money and when I do I try to share with her. Like on Sunday I let her borrow my video camera and now it's like it's all her's because she was making a movie and she still insults me with those usual yet very painful remarks she makes and some of the people she hangs around start to believe her and they don't take it from me when I tell them straight out when they ask me. But yeah over spring break she said that I said something that I really didn't say and she was mad at me for like month and a half after it supposedly happened and then when she found out that the guy actually liked her she wanted an apology for something I didn't do and that really ticked me off. I really don't know why she would think I would say something like that when we have been friends from the beginning of this school year. And I really don't want to lose her as a friend but I'm starting to question if she is really my friend because it's almost like she wants to be with him so much that she would give anything including her friend and almost like this attraction she has for him is ruling her life. I try my hardest to make everybody around me feel good and help them through their times of need and help them with their problems. But for some reason I feel like I am making to big a deal out of this and I should just tell her how I feel about the things she says to me, about me, and to other people because it's really bringing me down. I guess if I lose her as a friend I still have my other ones.    But I guess it all comes down to is this a phase or is she really my friend or maybe that's just how she is with guys that she likes.   Well to something less dramatic, my friends and I are graduating tomorrow. Yeah some people don't think there should be an 8th grade graduation. I guess they are doing this because some people don't always go to high school. But yeah my friend chichi is going to New jersey this summer and shemight be moving there but we'll see her threw-out the summer and next year. So I guess it's not that bad. Oh and my other friends Sonya is getting a job and she is going to teach me how to swim and play tennis, and we are going to get ready for next year because she wants to be on the football team and I want to be on the soccer team, so I have to work on my running and endurance.   Well anyway if you don't know who the person is I was talking about it was Kiara and Jonathan. So yeah.
