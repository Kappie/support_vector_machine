But seriously people, I want you to look at the Changes at Compendium  Each Blogger Gets Two Personal Links. I have mine down. I guessed on a couple of yours, but e-mail me if you have none or want some or think that I suck.  Comments are fixed so now Ryan can say that I suck. I guess he saw me do my monologue.
