As with everything in real life, this situation can be related to warcraft. So, people make games that say 'No Noobs,' but wasn't everyone a noob at one point and if they were and everyone made 'noobie free' games, how would anyone become anything but a noobie.  In order to find the Goat match, follow the "Baaaaahhhssss" of pain coming from the dying Goats.
