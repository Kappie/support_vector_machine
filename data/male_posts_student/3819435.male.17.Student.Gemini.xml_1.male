After that, we all went over to Craig's for an after-party.I was upset to see Nikki there but, hey, I couldn't ask her to leave. It is Craig's house, after all. I don't remember all that much about the after-party. I think I was doing figure-eights in and out of reality. I remember waking up next to Relissa with my shirt off. I asked her what happened and she said "Nothing", so I assumed that I hadn't raped her or anything.The next thing that I remember, I was watching Ben and Chase play DDR and Samantha was lying next to me. I zonked out again (I think). The next time I came around, it was about 4:30 and I was lying on the couch alone (for the first time all night).I decided that I should probably drive home because I had to work at 11. I made it home alright, crashed, got up, showered, went to work, played a round of golf at the "Sears Family Picnic", went over to my grandma's house for supper, came home, and crashed yet again.I'm still tired and I slept until about 3:30 today. I'll be home all day tomorrow (Tuesday) so if you're bored, give me a ring @ 339-3110. Nighty night! Lumps of love!
