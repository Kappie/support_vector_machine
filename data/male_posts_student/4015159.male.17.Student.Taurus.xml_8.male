Soon I'm going to start tearing the house apart looking for it, should be fun! like finding a fragment of a needle in 3 haystacks.          I'm also, in this blog, going to talk about a phrase often used on Big Brother. "The Housemates have successfully passed the task." Could they pass the task unsuccessfully, or could they fail it successfully? It's basically adding another word that isn't needed. Unless it is, let me know!
