Here's the story:  Two days ago, there was some nice girl I didn't know sitting on the edge of my swimming pool. I'm always a pussy when it comes to talking to complete female strangers for the sake of starting a conversation, but... I went down to the pool, and she was alone. I walked down to where she was, feeling like a pussy 'cause I wasn't sure if she'd like talking with me or not, but I thought "What's the worse that can happen?", so I sat down and greeted her. It turns out she was waiting for some drunk friends who weren't showing up (who showed up like 3 hours later). Meanwhile we talked and I gave her some company to fight boredom. She wasn'ts breathtakingly-hot, but she wasn't bad. She was Irish, 20 years old (though she looked like 18) and just finished university. She seemed very friendly.   The moral of this story is:  Quit being a pussy and use " the direct approach " to start a conversation with whoever you love/fancy, or whoever you feel attracted to. And like Nike says,   Just do it.       (I dedicate this post in particular to a certain online friend. You know who you are.)
