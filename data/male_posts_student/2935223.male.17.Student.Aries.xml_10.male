I GO TO JAPAN IN THREE DAYS!!!! w00t...is that not awesome or what?!?!?!?!? I ripped my pants more at mutual tonight :-( *boohoo* but I can probably have my dad sew them...YAY!  Uh, I had Kyle and Ervin go to mutual with me...and they both liked it...that was pretty kool.....uh....about the title of this blog. I have given myself freedom by finally ridding myself of Tina, as far as I know.  I'm not going to go after the relationship anymore, if SHE wants to have sum type of relationship, she's gonna have to get it.  As far as I'm conserned(spelling?) she's not worth the trouble....for the following reasons: 1.) I'm growing to be annoyed by her, especially her laugh 2.) She is continually switching her mind on the topic of friendship, and I'm pissed now 3.) She is trying to steal my friends, bitch. 4.) I have spent too much time caring for sumone who doesn't give a shit whether I fall off a cliff or not 5.) There's probably more reasons...but I can't think of any.. YAY!!! GO MEMORY!!! you suck.  Oh well, I will now go back to my less stressful life!! Peace!  Spense
