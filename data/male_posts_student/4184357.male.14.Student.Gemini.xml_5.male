So, my sister goes to spain for some college thing and my dad decides that since that cost him so much to get her there, we cant go anywhere for vacation! What? WHAT?!?!?! So I’ve been in my home town all summer w/ nothing to do but go to the pool, and be bored. I’m so tired of it! It’s the last week of summer and for some reason I think I’ve got some disease. For like the past three weeks, I’ve been wanting to go back to school… and I hate school! What’s up with that? I have no idea. I’m sick. Sick sick sick sick sick! And I haven’t even read my summer reading books! What the heck I’m goin to be doin a lot of reading from now till Monday. I don’t know how I’ll do it. Who knows.  O and get this. Sam, one of my best friends, isn’t allowed to come over to my house any more because his dad is a freekin tight ass ex-cop who got angry b/c my dad isn’t here most of the time. So I called my dad and he came home and was here for like two hours when sam’s dad calls sam’s cell phone and it was turned off so he calls my house, waking my dad up and then asking to talk to sam and so sam had to go home b/c his cell was off. Isn’t that dumb? I don’t know what it is but his dad is a tight ass. I’m goin to watch some music videos and then go read. Or am I? Who knows? No I’m just kidding, I am. Or am I kidding? Hmmmm who knows. I guess it’ll be something for all of you to think about… have fun!           ~BillBo
