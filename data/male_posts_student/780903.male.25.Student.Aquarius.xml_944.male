But why should that stop me.   "Admissible" (To the tune of Clay Aiken's "Invisible")   Saw, that gun in your room But I do not have, a warrant to search Drugs, are under your bed A knife in your hand One more in jail, and I get a raise So what if there's no crime I know of that you did  [Chorus]  If it was admissible The jury would send you straight to jail If it's insuppressible The trial would be quick Miranda inaudible Then I could just frame you for the crime The promotion would be mine If I was incompetent (Wait...I already am)  Saw, you killing a bug But was it a bug? Or was it a man? I keep looking at you You're washing your hands Wish that was blood, and not jelly you were washing off Wish I could find a corpse and blame you for the crime  [Chorus]  If it was admissible The jury would send you straight to jail If it's insuppressible The trial would be quick Miranda inaudible Then I could just frame you for the crime The promotion would be mine If I was incompetent (Wait...I already am)  You reach out Reaching for the poison? No, it's just the Pringles And another soda  We have no crime tied to you But I can't let that be true...  [Repeat Chorus]
