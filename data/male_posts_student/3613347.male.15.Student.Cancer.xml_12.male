Had to decide on what time the movie we should watch, as Chee Hong and Zhi Yang were still in Choa Chu Kang.  Called Chee Hong about 5 times and still no reply. Then finally, they are ontheir way. Movie was great. The cinema was a bit too cold, but i had a great show, or maybe 2 great shows.  Cause only 3 seats away, were a couple who were VERy intimate. Then i was supposed to sit beside them, but i didnt want to play Gooseberry, so i moved urthur away. Wei Yi and Job went to sit on the VIP Sofas!  Then we went to kick ball. Walked so far, stupid Yong Sheng very dumb. I know one street soccer court very near to West Mall, yet he went to one so far away....  Haiz... and even the game also go agaisnt me! Shot so many times, and their keeper damn zai! I hit the post twice already!!!! WHY NEVER SCORE?  Then my parents cannot find their way to us... So angry.. i so scared... but my composure saved me from a lot of scolding.  TATA
