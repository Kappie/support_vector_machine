Before that i felt that i had to do something for her, to show her how much i care, and poof. I gave her a jar of candies today with a note...i really don't know what will happen if she tells her mum, she seems to be very stressed over it...its worrying me too. But i really don't want to part with her, but if there is really no way out, then we just have to do the obvious, which i don't really want to say it out here. Although i know that her mum is strictly against the idea, i have this constant thought that everything will be ok, and i feel confident that it'll work out. I don't know why i feel so positive, power of love? heh. She doesnt seem to want to talk about it...buts its ok with me.  Ah...feel abit sad now, so heres a lyric to leave you with, its also by a hair metal group called skid row. Heres to you, hui.  "together we stand, well its just you and me,so baby hold on and you'll see. Forever we stand, and we'll make it through, cos i know i can't live without you."
