Every five minutes, it's someone saying "Mike, come here for this", or "Mike, come let me complain to you about that". Noone cuts a guy a break. Everyone wants a slice of my time, or my patience, by getting emotional over trivial things, or by calling on my assistance when it's unnecessary.  Sure, it sounds a little selfish of me to complain about that kind of thing, seeing as there's obviously more significant problems to deal with on this mess of a planet, but how does anyone expect me to remain sane, so I can continue to be ordered around and treated like a lapdog, evidently, when the aforementioned fools won't let me have 5 minutes to recollect myself? All I ask is time to think. Time to have some peace and quiet. Apparently everything's one sided enough to just keep pushing me.  People try my patience with their trivial issues about "baby's momma's drama" and "why in the hell dont you have my drug money?" Maybe if I showed these people what the hell was wrong with them instead of them pointing out what was wrong with me, instead of them ordering me around like I was their lackey, I give them something to do?
