If she calls "just to chat", that means she cares about you. If she calls asking for a favor, obviously she wants something from you. Either way, its probably not a bad thing. By doing the favor, you can impress her by showing her you are reliable. If you just take a few minutes (or hours, depending on the girl) to chat with her, she'll appreciate the gesture and your willingness to listen. Just make sure you return her phone call in a TIMELY MANNER. Don't wait a few days. Even if you don't have much time, you can at least call her back to let her know that. Otherwise, she'll think you're rude and hate you.
