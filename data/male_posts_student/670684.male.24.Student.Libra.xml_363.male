Not just films that were enjoyable but forgotten a few hours after viewing...shit that sticks with me right now, as I write, well distanced from the initial viewing. It's obvious that  urlLink Lost in Translation  is one...but I'd need to throw Charlie Kaufman's new offering  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  up for nomination as well.  Because of the star power and chic status of writer Kaufman, I'm sure it's got a full run at most theatres...and it's so worth the go.  Granted, you won't get to hear ELO's Mr. Blue Sky in the film, but everything about the story is wonderful, how it wraps together quicly, and plot progressions that most writers would stretch into two hours happen in ten minutes, allowing the story to move places that we can't keep up with, and we find ourselves at the end of the movie wanting something to happen, not knowing if it will.    Still thinking about it today, two days later.   Ordinary People  could fit that monicker too.  And somehow, I just deleted a full paragraph of writing.  Not going to rewrite it.    I'll be to page 60 of the Dawson Taylor script tonight.  Good progress. This is the calling card, the thing I expect to speak for me as I test my sea legs on the scriptwriting waters.    Current mode on life after college...summer job at UKansas, then who knows?  If no work, probably a month or six weeks in Fayetteville, trying to pick up part-time work in film or some semblance of media (nothing against those people in Fayetteville, but my grad degree in film should give me a leg to stand on in the area, and maybe I can pursue some grantage for this script), and if I can't find full-time work there, I do the same thing in Palm Springs.  No reason to pay rent anywhere yet if I'm not working somewhere.  I don't plan to live full-time in either place, but why not try my options and do a bit of travel in the interim?    Going back on past writings pre-blog, I was big on "quoting" things that I wanted emphasized, as if my reading audience wouldn't understand my stressors without the visual reminder.  I "apologize" for my presumptive nature.
