I dunno i think london is the place to go get the degree, deal in art and finance a fun lifestyle. hehe wouldnt that be cool though? just buying and selling art...making millions...thats so for me!  back to reality...Noah's birthday BBQ today! should be a laugh, gotta show Simon his racing DVD...should be a good day.  hehe nothing better then watching Hollyoaks on a sunday...so funny - why cant life be as funny as it is with Zara, thingy, thingy, thingy and Bom-edd.  ah..cant wait until disneyland - charli's all excited too - gemma...well havnt really spoken much to her but i'm sure shes well excited too! this is gonna be fantabulous! yeah thats right....fantastically fabulous...is that a gay term? anyway...i'm in need of some hugs - hopefully i'll get lots in Paris - with gem and charli it should all be good - hehe i ought to buy a hat from River Island...then walk into the clubs with two birds on my arm...ooo pimp daddy James!  wahey! i can see it now! ROLL ON DISNEYLAND!
