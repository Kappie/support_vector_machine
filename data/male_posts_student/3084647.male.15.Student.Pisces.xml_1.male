Wizards were sitting at tables with rather mismatched chairs, either reading the latest edition of  Transfiguration Today  or the local wizard paper,  The Daily Chronicle . Most of them had a pipe and were smoking. What it was Cheryl didn’t know, but it sure stank. It smelt like burning rubber. 	 The trio edged their way past the crowded tables and to the back of the inn, where all the private parlours were situated. Just as they passed Parlour 1 Cheryl heard a rather familiar voice.  	 “Well, I’m not too sure, Minellus, it’s just so odd...” the voice had a rather fruity note to it. It was so familiar... suddenly it clicked – it was Percival Tan, the Minister of Magic. Cheryl pressed her ear to the door. What business did the Minister have in the Wacky Wizard? 	 “Cheryl! What’re you doing?”  	 Cheryl jumped. Muthu was staring at her. 	 “Nothing... er, tying my laces... you go in first...” As Muthu disappeared behind the next door, Cheryl chanced a peek. As the door had not been closed properly, there was a tiny crack through which she could see. She could see the Minister – he looked slightly puzzled. There was a bottle of wine on the table in front of him – the wine looked abnormally red. Almost like blood... 	 “Why don’t you take a drink, Minister,” another man’s voice said, sourly. Cheryl saw the Minister take a sip of the wine. Suddenly she felt something brush by her. She yelped, only to realize that it was the resident tabby cat of the inn. Breathing a sigh of relief, she resumed peeking, only to see the Minister look rather dreamy, his eyes unfocused. He uttered a nonchalant “Yes.”  	 “So if you’ll just sign here, Minister...” the other man handed over a piece of paper.  	 “Cheryl! Hurry up!” This time it was Matt at the door, staring at her queer stance.  	 “Coming,” Cheryl replied, as she straightened up. She put the scene she had just witnessed out of her mind. It wasn’t her business anyway.  					 ----------  It was a thoroughly enjoyable meal, consisting of many, many delightful dishes whipped up by the resident chef at the Wacky Wizard. They were all sitting back in their comfy chairs, replete and relaxed, chatting amongst themselves. Cheryl finished the last of her durian puff and groaned.  	 “My jeans feel tighter,” she complained. Everyone laughed indulgently, for they too had eaten fit to burst. 	 “Time to go to bed, kids,” Mr. Cheah said, yawning. “You all have an early day tomorrow.” 	 No one argued – the food was making them feel very, very drowsy. Cheryl climbed the stairs up to her room and collapsed on her bed. She had just enough time to close the hangings before falling into a deep sleep, the taste of durian still on her lips...
