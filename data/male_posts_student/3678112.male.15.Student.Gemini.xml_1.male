Cash is held down on a surgical table and given the lethal injection. The public know you’re dead. Wrong. The lethal injection turned out to be nothing more than a sedative to put you to sleep for a while, in which time a mysterious man known as The Director, or Stearkweather to his “friends”, transported you to a run down hell-hole known as Carcer City. Cash wakes up to find he has been given a second chance.. a second attempt at life. The chance comes with a clause though. To be set free, Cash must first obey the instructions of the power hungry Stearkweather and take part in a series of missions that will see Cash have to kill or be killed by a series of bloody hungry gangs that roam the Carcer City streets. The City has been fitted with video cameras in every nook and cranny, ready to film every sick and repulsive act that occurs within Carcer City. That’s right. You’re the new star of a disturbing snuff movie.   Contrary to this, Manhunt is far from a story driven game. In fact it is just the opposite. Rather than taking you through a set story, Manhunt takes the rather old school format of providing a number of missions as appose to a continuous story. Each mission is separate from the last, and is narrated individually by Stearkweather. The missions will place you in any number of horrible situations, where you find yourself up against any number of “hunters” from a lethal gang, who are all vying for you’re blood.   So we know the games background, but what does it play like? Well Manhunt is almost totally geared towards stealth. When people think of the “hide and seek” genre, the first games that come to mind are obviously Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid. Well you can add Manhunt to that list because in some ways, Rockstars sick sim is probably more of a stealth game than Metal Gear. Almost 99% of the time in Manhunt, Stealth is by far the best option. There is a brilliant combat system integrated into Manhunt, but unfortunately you wont get chance to use it as much as many would like. Stealth is key in  Manhunt to the point where even two on one open combat situations are seemingly impossible to win. If found by even one gang member, it’s still probably better to run and fight another day than to stand and take him on. Besides, the amount of hunters roaming any one area as the game progresses means even if you do decide to take someone on in hand to hand combat, it won't take much for the hunter to call his mates, and you’ll end up as a bloody pulp on the floor before you can say “please don’t kill me”.   But how does the stealth work? Well, each level has many different dark areas known as “safe zones” that Cash must utilise to take on the hunters. When spotted by a hunter, you must run away as quickly as you can and find a safe zone to hide in. Providing the hunters don’t see you run into the dark, you can hide safely. While this does add to the gameplay immensely, it does detract from the realism of the game. A hunter can be looking right into your eyes, but if you’re in a safe zone he can’t see you at all. If you can’t kill people with open combat, then how are we supposed to kill the games foes? Well that comes with the safe zones. By attracting a hunter to your location, he will come to investigate. Once he has finished and his back is turned, its time for you to finish him off. Cash can sneak up behind the hunter, and once he raises his arm, its time for you to move in for the kill. Providing you have a weapon in your hand, you can hold down either of the attack buttons which will trigger an offensive move from cash. Hold down attack for 1-3 seconds and you will simply kill the hunter. 3-5 seconds will trigger a more sickening finish, while holding down the button for more than 5 seconds will trigger a very violent and disturbing death sequence. These death sequences are shown from the point of view of Stearkweather’s cameras, including the fuzzy reception and “record” symbol in the top corner of the screen. Death sequences range from simply stabbing someone in the neck with a shard of glass, to hacking a hunters head off until it slices straight off his neck. Naturally, there’s some sickening scenes and more than enough blood, making this deffinently an adult only experience.
