Every aspect of the site is designed to facillitate relationship-building and idea sharing between people seeking to understand what "being church" means in the 21st century. It's an interesting stew of user-submitted articles, blogs, websites, and resources. It's the type of site that I'll intend to take a quick peek at but invariably end up spending two hours on. They've also added this very blog to its ever-growing directory, so you know it's a website of great taste and discretion!  urlLink Go get yourself stuck in THE OOZE today!
