Mrs. Snyder's pretty cool. I enjoyed the Jazz and impressionist units, but what I really liked was our most recent, and final project. We were given a list of songs we had listened to in class, and had to pick 3 that we liked. Then we were to pick 3 of our own songs, and make a CD and write 2 paragraphs (too little, really) about why we choose what songs we did. Not being one to waste a CD, I have 16 songs on mine (but only wrote about her 3 and 3 of mine, so I would keep my A in the class). The track list is as follows:     Maple Leaf Rag  – Scott Joplin *     It Had To Be You  – Frank Sinatra *     What A Wonderful World  – Louis Armstrong *     Hallelujah  – Rufus Wainwright    I Am What I Am  – Gloria Gaynor    Supermodel (You Better Work)  – RuPaul    Let's Hear It for the Boy (Factory Main Mix)  – Katty B.  Various Artists    Save The Last Dance For Me  – The Drifters    Flamboyant  – Pet Shop Boys    Crying at the Discotheque (Radio Edit)  – Alcazar    Forever Young (Queer As Folk Mix)  – Temperance    No Time At All  –  Pippin  - Original Broadway Cast    Head Over Heels  – Go-Go's    Dancing Queen  (Dance Mix)  – ABBA    Come Away With Me  – Norah Jones    C'est Ça Le Jazz (All That Jazz)  – Veronique DiCaire    So here is the breakdown. The first 3 (with the asterisk) are from her list. The rest are mine. Nine are from the show  Queer As Folk , 2 are from musicals, one is by Norah Jones ( Come Away With Me , very romantic in that jazzy kinda way), and one is by Rufus Wainwright ( Hallelujah ). So when you break it all down, only 4 of them are not gay in some way. Those would be Norah (I could debate that it could be, but...), and the first 3. The rest are from a musical, or by a gay artist, or from  QaF . If nothing else I had fun putting it together. All are good songs, so check 'em out.
