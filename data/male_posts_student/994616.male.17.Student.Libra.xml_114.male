It's still called Sydney University even though it is definately no where near Sydney. The perplexing part? How I will survive in a rural community (Yes I know it is already a  urlLink TV Show ) Right now im looking at either doing bachelor of the arts or of liberal studies at orange. In either case i am reminded of what will said on  urlLink Will and Grace  "Next year, I want a real cowboy"  I suppose if I want to fulfil my part in both shows though, I will have to release a porn tape.
