Thats the question for today.  First of all, as always, lets see what dictionary.com has to say about normality:  norÂ·mal    adj.  1. Conforming with, adhering to, or constituting a norm, standard, pattern, level, or type. 2. The usual or expected state, form, amount, or degree.  So, what the dictionary refrence is saying, is that being normal is matching up with the "norm" or what is supposed to happen, or what you are supposed to do in this case.  Lets take an example into consideration: Lets take a popular "idol", a person who everyone knows, like Brad Pitt. Say Brad walked out of his mansion one day wearing a chicken suit. Soon, everyone would be wearing a chicken suit. Something that outrageous would be considered the norm, after someone with considerable influence did it.  So, how is the norm set? Everyone wants to be like the most popular people in Hollywood and other places that carry "stars". They mimic the hairstyles, clothing, accessories, line, everything that these people have to offer, just to seem cool. Doing those things would be considered the norm for that point in time. But the thing is, dressing up as one of the Beetles would not be considered cool in today's society. So, what that is saying is that the norm changes with those who are popular.  Why should you try to be normal? Well, this is more of a personal question. Everyone wants to fit in. And in escense, we all fit in with a specific group. The goths might not seem normal to a nerd, but goths are normal to other goths. Same with nerds to other nerds. It's where we fit in that determins our norm. Not all of us will appear normal to the person across the street. It's just something that can't happen.  The bottom line is, be what you want to be. Don't try to fit in with people who don't suit you. If you don't like nerds, but go to a "nerdy" school, don't try to be a nerd just to fit in. Be a unique person, a leader of men, not a follower. And if you want to be a follower, don't go for stupid trends that you will regret later, like getting your whole body tattooed. Here endith the 14th lesson.  Lates
