Terror, as in “The Reign of Terror”, and as in  monsters with bloody fangs.  The deliberation behind using the word  terror was well thought out. America is viewed as on of the most dominant  nations in the world (I refuse to believe they are, because strength can never  be found in one source alone), and yet their people live in invariable horror.   “Fuck, man, that kid is carrying a plastic sword, he’s a terrorist!”    The irony. Anyway, where does the authentic terror come from? Is it  really from people like Bin Laden or is it from the American government itself?  Fear has always been a good way to control people, and that’s why dictatorships  can do astounding things if the country is at heart.   More and more  each day I find that America is adopting a system much alike to Orwell’s vision  of dystopia in 1984, Ingsoc (Oh, go  urlLink read  the book already,  you can even find it online. I even provided the link you cunts).   Your  thoughts?       Moron of the Day:   urlLink Article Found  Here    After finding an air sickness bag in a lavatory with the  letters BOB written on it, a United flight attendant concluded the meaning was  "bomb on board" and alerted the captain. The captain figured that was  reasonable, and  urlLink returned  the LA-bound flight to Sydney .
