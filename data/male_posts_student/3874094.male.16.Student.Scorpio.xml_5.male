Wahahaha, yea been slacking allthe way..and oh my goodness, just realized that i have already spent about a month in ngee ann...and i still feel like some dumb freshie! Seriously,i have beenslacking way too much...couldntdo shit for PSP1, and now we are gonna start GUI, i am seriously in deep, deep  shit.    Ah anyway, yeah back to the title's meaning, big cousin Jasmine has finally come home! Its been three long years since she left for the UK to study in the University Of Warwick. And well, bit sad really that she's home now., For her of course, and for me. Why for me? Haha, cause there goes my yearly supply of Wrigley's and Rowntree's gums( In case you are wondering, Wrigley's isa brand of chewing gum and Rowntree is theUKequivalent of Frutips) .   Dad too just came home from his business trip to Vietnam...dang, didnt bringany pirated stuff except for one very lousy Spiderman2 dvd. What he didbuy back though, was two verynice adidas shirts, imitations of course! But hey, they look sweeeeeet.......whats worrying is that he's kinda ill...and he workedlate...thats somethin i have not seen in years...sentiments echoed by my big sis.   Now back to my day..er, kinda hectic today...ran around ngee ann trying to get NFSP:Underground for waimun..think i pissed Linsing off a bit with my consistent pestering..so sorry there mate...  Went straight home, did the violin until it was time for the piano accompaniment class which went well, slightly better than the first one but still, it was mostly a bloody disaster..especially screwing up on the octave double stops again for Dvorak and also couldnt get my timing right for the Fantasia piece...oh well..i am gonna screw up grade 6, just like i did for grade 5..oh man oh maaaaan.....   Went straight down to harmonica...testimonial once more denied...seriously, i dont get it, must i be PRESENT when a mdm peng does the testimonial? Isnt a testimonial supposed to be done alone where she can gather her thoughts in private? Yea? Argh dont know la....   Followed the usual crowd to Jp..and blew 2.80 for bubble tea...haha decided to try it after not drinking bubble tea for like almost wat, 1 and a half years? And er, after finishing the thing, i swear i will not waste money like that ever again. LOL. Continued walking around until surprise surprise, ran into jintang and kelvin at pastamania. Sat down and chatted about all kinds of crap and life in SP. After seperating, walked again until we ran into chinhong..funny, lucky to have ran into 3 classmates of mine..sadly all in SP... :(   Nothing much after that, went home, had dinner, and blah blah blah, played gb for a while with the usual ppl...was slightly amused at sylvia's many attempts to shoot me..ah well, cant really laugh..she's still a noob after all...uh, yea..spent most of the time lookin at cs skins..its all that andrew's fault, got me hooked onto downloading the skins.   And surprisingly, thats friday for me...weekend upon me once again...need no prediction that i am gonna slack through again..wahaha. Thats about it then, since dad is home now, cant afford to stay up too late or things will start flying around...lol.Oh yea, something's wrong with the music code, mei having the same problem too, oh well, life's a bitch yea?   Later people.
