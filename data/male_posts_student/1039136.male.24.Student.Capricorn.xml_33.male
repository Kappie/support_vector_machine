Going in to this whole sorority formal thing I expected to hate it as well.   I've been sleeping all day. I gag at the thought of alcohol. Why? Because I partied all last night and partied hard.  The AST formal last night was incredible. I danced. Let me repeat that. I danced. I wasn't even playing a Teen Icon or anything. John danced.  Ya know what was wrong with all those proms and crap that you hated? There wasnt an open bar. Now of course the night had its drama, because well, in case you forgot, a sorority is a group of GIRLS. Beyond the tears, the little spats, the dirty looks...i  think MOST of the girls had a great time. The food was actually good too, which is surprising. The whole thing started at 7, I drank 77's, long island ice tea's and more 77's, I sang something, danced, and brought down a funnel.   The funnel was a good time as usual, and after that came the after party. I would probably have ended up skinny dipping but the pool was closed.  We went from room to room, and continued to drink.  At some point we ended up in a room where a KDR guy stood there and gave this 45 minute speech on how he hates acacia.. Then KDR dude left and about 2 minutes later, Craig from acacia came in and gave an hour speech about how he hates KDR.  The night was just insane! I had an awesome time. Big thanks to Sarah for taking me, and AST for partying hard and hardly sleeping. I think this was one of the best party nights in a long long time and I needed it!  Oh yeah, appparently my name is Daddy Big thanks to AST pledge jenn. Who knows?!  What a crazy fucking night..words cant do it justice. The sun burned my eyes in the morning.   Must do this formal thing again. Back to not drinking for a little. :)
