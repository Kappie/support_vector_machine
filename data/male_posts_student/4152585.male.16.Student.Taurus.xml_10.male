Kerry was treating running mate Sen. John Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, to a Wendy's lunch in Newburgh, N.Y., for their 27th wedding anniversary  an Edwards family tradition  when the candidate approached four Marines and asked them questions.  The Marines  two in uniform and two off-duty  were polite but curt while chatting with Kerry, answering most of his questions with a "yes, sir" or "no, sir."  But they turned downright nasty after the Massachusetts senator thanked them "for their service" and left.  "He imposed on us and I disagree with him coming over here shaking our hands," one Marine said, adding, "I'm 100 percent against [him]."  A sergeant with 10 years of service under his belt said, "I speak for all of us. We think that we are doing the right thing in Iraq," before saying he is to be deployed there in a few weeks and is "eager" to go and serve.  The Marines  all of whom serve at nearby Stewart Air Force Base  wouldn't give their names.
