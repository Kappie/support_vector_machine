(not to mention watching the Euro 2004!!) i went to K.L. it was kinda fun. it was suppose to be a family thing but my sis had to get ready for her first day teaching and my bro had to go to work. so it was only me, my mum and my dad. my mum wasn't really into travelling. she was reluctant to go. i think my dad was also reluctant. maybe because the fact that it was just a few days before work and school reopens or maybe because of the fact that the whole family wasn't going. i have no idea. but in the end we went. went shopping, theme park, went up the petronas tower and more shopping!!most of the time my mum does all of the shopping BUT like always, i have to tag a long. luckily now i have my own freedom. i don't always have to hold her hands like when i was 5 or 6. i can go somewhere else while she's scampering among the mountains of clothes. i remembered when i was around 6 i think. i was following my mum shopping at the nearby mall. it was kinda tiring but it was all worth it when i could go to the toy's department.(although my mum doesn't allow me to buy anything) that was the best part about going shopping. BUT! like always, if theres the best part, there must be always be the bad part. the worst is yet to come!! when i have already indulge myself on the sight of all the toys, my mum will grab my hand and walk to this area. at first, i thought that my mum was buying a new blouse or a skirt. but then, when i walk around this shelf, when i got the first glimpse of it, i got the shock of my life! you know what it was?? the worst thing that can happend to a 6 year old kid. UNDERWEAR!! lots and lots of them! she had taken me to the ladies underwear section! it was like 'what the hell am i doing here??' dam!can't a 6 year boy get some space around here?? it was like stepping into no-man's land. a smaller version of the bermuda triangle. the last place a 6 year old kid wants to go. so i have entered the so called 'AREA 51'.so i tag along with my mum as i entered Area 51. so there it was; me, my mum and lots and lots of underwear. it was hanging everywhere! here, there, everywhere, underwear!! red colur, blue colur, black colour... i never knew that there were so many colours in entire life! i always try not to look at any one of them. i close my eyes. sometimes there will be some ladies there buying them(the undies). they will stare at me for a few seconds. my god! shame! so shameful! i was facing death head-on. i lost my honour, pride and dignity. so from then onwards, i went there like once a week for the next few years. it as like my fourth house. those were the days... hahaha. when it think back of what had happend, its kinda funny. hahaha. ok then. thats all for today. til next time...   ~Peace Out~    Crash
