If fate and omens play any part in this, we shall observe a second land-blown hurricane descend about our mortal ears. A tornado will peel the bark off trees and panes from windows. After such, hail shall rain with such intensity as to render roofs and walls useless, and straightline winds will sweep away the debris, the trees, and everything not duct taped down. Lightning shall light the streets with unnatural fire. And then everyone shall crawl out, those who are still alive.  If fate and omens have nothing to do with it, July 22 will pass just as quietly as it would have a year ago had the storm not occurred. Wait. That seems a bit pointless to say. Oh well.  Got AP scores back today. I took biology (and lab) as well as english language and composition. On both I recieved ........................... *drum roll proceeds* ..................... a five out of five. Holla out. I will be bringing this holy sheet of grades to Mrs. Wexler's evil chamber of doom and wave it in her direction, allowing the scent of success to waft into her face. Let her see that her english essays hath not smited my spirit! We shall triumph. (Eventually).  Manda over in Alabama is one of the coolest people I know at the present time. I will have to see her and Amber very very soon in a bittersweet reunion of our time in Memphis. And then we will flee to college and see one another every weekend.  Cheers, my fellows.
