GRACE polyclinic, any of you heard of that? i went home to eat dinner, that was around 12 i think, and the yellow flu tablets made me drowsy, so i popped straight to sleep in bed. when i woke up, i saw hui. woahh..i thought i was dreaming. real shocked to see her there. really glad she came to visit! :D :D :D. after she left, i went back to sleep till around 1, and i went to meet, yvette,cynthia, jon and hui for a movie. was supposed to be sisters, but there cineplex didnt have it so, we watched king arthur. the outfits were cool.but it has the same plot almost every action or war movie has. good guys = handsome young men who always win in the end. bad guys = ugly ol fags who lose their temper. butifit isnt like this,the audience will say its a bad movie right? so,yeh.hui was really cheerful, heheh...it was nice to see her like this. :) we went for some jap food at bedok which wasnt really that good, butstill edilble.random fact #857151-8 " iused3 packs of tissue instead of the 6 i brought". all in all, im still sick.
