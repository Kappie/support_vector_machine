Am feeling a little more human and a little less like Gollum after pilates and chatting with J.H. last night. Somehow everything looks a little less bleak.  Am thinking of going out tonight, just me, and see if i can't strike up conversation with anyone. I am a sort of social parapalegic, and really need to practice my skills of interaction if i don't want to be a wallflower(any longer) The humidity has abated somewhat, which is a godsend, and hopefully will remain out of the stratosphere. Looks like I will get a bunch of food from the garden when i see Mum and Jan this weekend, Beans, Peas, Eggplants, Hot peppers, Lemon cucumbers, herbs, collards, lettuce, swiss chard. That will certainly help out the I Hate Being Poor fund, produce is so expensive, especially organic produce. d
