Now that I've said that, I just hope this game won't suck. Fallout is one of the best RPG game series of all time, and Bethesda is a skilled developer of RPG games. (They made all of the Elder Scrolls games, which younger players may know best from their XBox/PC game, Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind; this was the best in the series.)  If Bethesda doesn't make this game live up to the expectations that are already soaring, I'm organizing a Jim Jones-esque "There are no more RPGs" cult. Who's with me?  Afterthought: I think I really just dated myself with that last reference.
