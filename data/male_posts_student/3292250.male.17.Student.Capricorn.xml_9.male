The entire ensemble was amazing, the musical direction was exactly what I would expect for this show, and the leading roles were outstanding. Bryan Archer as Pippin was a perfect match. Evie Victorson was perfect as Fastrada, right down the her shining moment in the number "Spread A Little Sunshine", complete with the choreography originally by Bob Fosse himself.  This being the second time I've seen Pippin on stage, as well as listening to the soundtrack, I really enjoyed myself. The first time I saw it was when my Middle School did Pippin as our Spring Musical. I also was part of the "War Is A Science" number during my Musical Theater class that year, so I know the words to a good number of the songs. All in all, it was a great way to spend Saturday night.
