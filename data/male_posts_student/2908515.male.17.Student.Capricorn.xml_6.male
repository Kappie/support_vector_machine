On Friday, I wanted to do something with people because of the recent actions in our school.  I just wanted to have fun because school is not nearly as fun anymore.  Not with the policemen and all.  Anyway, I assembled a crew fit for a king.  It was Alex, Ben, Ed and I.  I had not spoken to Ed in a long while and I feel bad sometimes for "ignoring" him either consciously or subconsciously.  I like Ben and Alex is cool too.  Although sometimes Alex seems inhuman because he doesn't get mad or sad or anything.  Or maybe I just don't see it.  Anyway, we went to the mall and walked around.  To make a long story short, I think going to the mall with those people was a bad mistake because I felt like the odd fourth wheel out.  The other three had things to talk about like marching band or some new video game or whatnot.  I'll chirp in a few times but...eh, I didn't get much conversation time.  I made some excuse so that Ed and Ben could go off to look for...Resident Evil soundtrack?  Or something.  At that point, I would have rathered hung out with Alex because he is easy to talk to.  I bought a megaman shirt at Hottopic.  Its really cool.  After that, we just went home.  I dropped the three of them at Ed's house after I made some shitty excuse about "I'm not too keen on going to people's houses" or "I have some other stuff I want to buy, I'm gonna be stopping at Gamestop or something".  In truth, I really didn't want to stay with them anymore, there wasn't anything to do.  And Ed has his car, he could drive them, not like he drives me anywhere.    But then, I shouldn't really complain. I shouldn't be telling or hinting at what he should or shouldn't do. Right?  ...  On Saturday, I went to my grandmother's grave with my brothers alone.  Since my parents are out of the state right now at another funeral.  It was raining.  It was dark, overcast.  What a wonderful day?  Well, I thought so until I locked my keys in my car.  Yup, keys in car, locked, in King O Prussia.  I waited about an hour and a half for my Aunt to come and pick me up after I left about five thousand messages on her answering machine.  Its times like this I wished I had a cellphone or something.  All of my car capable friends were out of town.  I thought about calling Ed but after last night at the mall, I didn't.  I need time to think about things.  Anyway, I got back home and got the key and went to the car again and drove home.  I called me work place to say I couldn't come in after I told them I locked me keys in the car.  All they said was, "Well, after you get your keys out, tell me what time you could come in."  I was a bit peeved at that because they apparently didn't care about me and wanted me to just come in and work for them as soon as possible.  Whatever, really.  It was my last day and I just did not come.  Fuck them, so to say.  So I went home and dawdled a bit online.  I still have to start the speech for social studies.  Saturday evening, I went out and bought three movies at Hollywood videos.  Bowling for Columbine made me think.  And it made me want to take some affirmitive action in some of the things I disagree with.  It motivated me.  Maybe I'll do something.  I don't know.  Went to Burger King with my brothers.  I felt guilty for eating a big ass whopper.  But whatever.  Sometimes in public places, I get the feeling that people glance at me.  Its strange in unnerving.  Sometimes in school, I feel that too.  Maybe its just me.   I went home and watched some movies.  Then went to bed.  This morning I woke up.  It was sunny outside and it definately made me feel better.  I'm unemployed and its sunny.  What more could I ask for?  Well, a lot more but thats not the point.  Enjoy every moment because the next moment will be different.  I hate Xangas that retell past events.  No one cares.  But in this case, thats the only thing that I could think of putting in this entry.  I'll try to end with some of my thoughts on stuff.  I guess.  Sometimes I feel very lonely because I do not have a person in which I could share an interest exclusively.  It bothers me to be a fox and know a little about a lot, so to say.  Well not really, but something like that.  I'm not a huge music fan but I like music.  I'm not a huge violin player (or particulary any good) but I like violin.  I'm not a huge hacky sacker but I like hacky sack.  I am not too well versed in doing some sort of hobby, but I find it interesting.  But I keep finding people left and right that have one sort of thing that they're keen on.  Some sort of hobby, craft, whatever, that they do all the time.  And they talk to other people about that interest, hobby, craft or whatever.  But when I try to do that, I can only talk about it for so long until I lose interest or I don't know anymore about that subject.  There are a few people in which I can talk to about anything in the world.  A few really.  And thats pretty cool.  But I can't help it sometimes to speak to another person about stuff too.  You know, to get a third or fourth point of view on things.    I don't know.  Whatever.
