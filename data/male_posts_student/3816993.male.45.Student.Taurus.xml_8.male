It was a lovely place to be most of the time, but one night the pastor referred to G-d by the name, “Oh, Delicious One.” I thought I would fall from my chair and piss on myself.

(actually, it turns out that maybe it is not all that secure)   (Thanks to  urlLink T.

The ordinary, done with intention and focus, is extraordinary--   (Thanks to Andi at  urlLink Ditch the raft )    Our immediate task around the world and in Iraq and Afghanistan is to bring those terrorists to justice. See, you can’t talk sense to them. You can’t negotiate with terrorists. You can’t sit back and hope that somehow therapy will work and they will change their ways. That’s just not the way it is. We must engage the enemies in Afghanistan and Iraq and around the world so we do not have to face them here at home.  - George W. Bush, July 14, 2004, Waukesha, Wisconsin   You’re familiar with the old written law, "Love your friend," and its unwritten companion, "Hate your enemy." I’m challenging that. I’m telling you to love your enemies. Let them bring out the best in you, not the worst. When someone gives you a hard time, respond with the energies of prayer, for then you are working out of your true selves, your God-created selves. This is what God does. He gives his best–the sun to warm and the rain to nourish–to everyone, regardless: the good and bad, the nice and nasty. If all you do is love the lovable, do you expect a bonus? Anybody can do that. If you simply say hello to those who greet you, do you expect a medal? Any run-of-the-mill sinner does that. In a word, what I’m saying is, "Grow up." You’re kingdom subjects. Now live like it. Live out your God-created identity. Live generously and graciously toward others, the way God loves toward you.  - Jesus, around 30-33 AD, Israel, as quoted in  urlLink The Message   [see Matthew 5:43-48]   (Thanks to Candace by way of  urlLink the christian agnostic)
