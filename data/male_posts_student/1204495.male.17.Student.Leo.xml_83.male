The freedom given to us by our founding fathers, who fought so valiently for us. The Angel Of Darkness is here. What shall we do?, run like the cowards we are? or draw our swords and prove once and for all that we are the brave ones and the Angel Of Darkness is nothing more than fear itself. We can defeat the Angel Of Darkness and destroy our fear of that one special thing in our life. The thing we hold so close to us, yet fear as no man has feared before. Yes the Angel Of Darkness is our fear of love. don't let the Angel Of Darkness win, destroy her and reap the rewards!
