Day "1"   On June 13th, 2003, I went to the airport. I have no clue what day it was in America when I arrived, but it was the 14th there.  The plane ride was 10 hours of boredom. We sat next to a raging bulldyke. It was exciting.   Jenny fell in love with this gross head steward who looked like he was 60. His name was Simon, he was British and he lived in Thailand. She spent a good portion of the flight taking pictures of him when he wasn't looking.  I couldn't sleep, due mainly to the fact that there was daylight for the whole flight.  The in-flight movies were Analyze That, The Wedding Planner and Daredevil. Other than tuning into the dubbed versions every once in a while for entertainment, I only watched Daredevil. It was shit. Not even Ben Affleck saved that movie from being complete and utter shit.  We landed. Big surprise. Customs was ridiculously easy.  We met up with Tina outside the gate. Tina is one of my absolute favorite people. She is beautiful, funny and intelligent. She even has a weird pseudo British accent when she speaks in English.  We went to cash some Traveler's Cheques. I felt rich afterwords.  We took the train to Ikebukuro for dinner. Here was where I discovered several things. a) Everyone here was Japanese. Even Chinese people stood out like ketchup on mashed potatoes. b) No one spoke English. So I could discuss anything I wanted to with Jennifer.  When we got to Ikebukuro we went for a snack at Excelsior Cafe. This place was a total Starbucks knockoff, but I discovered something totally kickass here. Japanese chocolate croissaints are crossaints with Nutella inside. Kickass. Anyways, we met up with one of Tina's friends for dinner, a gorgous Indian British person thing, who was really cool. Dinner was...interesting.  We went to Shingashi and took a cab to Tina's apartment. We slept.
