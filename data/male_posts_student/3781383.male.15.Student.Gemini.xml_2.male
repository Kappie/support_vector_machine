I got to drive on the way up there but my mom was freaking out because she was falling asleep and the over 21 driver cant fall asleep.  She got some coffee and took over.  I only got to drive for about three hours.  We also got some really good pasties from this place around the Seiney Strech.  My mom likes hers with lots of vegetables.  I just got mine with meat'n'taters...  While we were up there out neighbors, who actually own the country club down here, had a surprise party.  The Minto family was having a surprise party for the husband, Mike.  He was turning fifty.  My family are close friends with there family and we went.  They are on the other side of the lake and it was going to be a boat tour, so we drive our ghetto boat.  It is a 20 foot pontune boat that only has a seat for the driver so we have to bring plastic chairs on.  It is a lot of boat to be pushed by a 28 horse motor.  It takes a good 1/2 hour to go the three miles acrosse the lake.  The party at the house was very fun.  I started out with Mike getting home from Brook Trout fishing (which was a set up).  We had drinks and apatizers for like 20 mins and then we got on the boats and headed north for the Hoop'n'Holler.  Our boat was the first off the dock, and there were about five there.  We were going full tilt because we knew everyone would catch up to us.  When they did one of the people had a really big speed boat.  We got caught in its wake and it drove our front under.  We got to the Hoop and found out that one of our pontunes was leaking.  I chose to stay and my parents and our guests went back home.  Everyone else went to sandy beach.  It is the only public sandy place on the lake that isn't a campground.  We then left to go to a bar just off the lake that is called the Locker Room.  We had to dock somewhere and walk like 5 blocks to the bar.  Everyone was whining the whole time.  I found it refreshing.  The Locker Room is some crappy little sports bar, but the pool was free and so was the popcorn.  I got the jukebox to play for free and we played some drinking songs and a few other things.  Eventually some friends of my mom's handed me a beer, a cigarette, and put a big uncle sam hat on me and took a picture.  That went over well.  *rolls eyes*.  We eventually went back to the house and my parens and our guests were waiting there (they took a car).  The party was VERY nice.  When we go there after the tour I look around and said, "There are a lotta pretty women here..."  The oldest Minto child is a girl who is like 22.  Her name is Mandi.  She seemed to have brought a couple of her friends along with her.  I spent most of my time with them.  We talked about how highschool has changed and she noticed the sandals I was wearing.  They are the filp=flops with a strap instead of that toe thing.  They are black maroon and gold and say cardinals highschool on them.  She was ranting about how the cardinal shop never hooked them up with cool stuff like that.  I actually got them at wal-mart for like 7 bucks.  We got a new boat the next day.  It was another 20 footer, same brand, but it had seats.  It had a rear entry with built-in ladder, a tow cable for tubing, and a 50 horse/4-stroke/Merc that is really fast for a pontune that size.  We can pull a tuber but not a skier, the motor isn't THAT strong.  My grandparents came up and some meanial stuff happened.  My mom and I were alone for the last week because my dad obviously has to work.  On his last night here we went out ith his buddies on our boat.  Dad got smashed and we all laghed because he could barely stand up.  He also had a loss of short term memory.  He was fine the next day and flew out at about 11.  The trip home was about the same as the way up.  Now I'm getting ready to go hang out with one of my friends.  If one of my friends is readying this, call me when I get home.  I have a lot of summer to make up for.  Thanks for reading!  Mood-figity Music-vh1 cntry music (channel 114 on charter digital)
