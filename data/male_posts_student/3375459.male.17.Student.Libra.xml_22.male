It took me a full day to stabilize my body temperature, and I had a relapse. Mum had to stay up again, just to wipe my forehead with a wet towel. After about 20minutes, she went to bed thinking I was OK. But as soon as she left, I started heating up once more. The mattress was making things worse as it was trapping heat I generated. I didn’t want to wake Mum up again, so I pushed aside the mattress and slept on the floor itself. The floor took my excess body heat away, so cooling… I fell asleep soon after, and woke up 7 hours later with a body temperature of 36.5°C. Phewp~ at last, back to normal body temperature. Please, no more relapse…   Cough so much until sore throat, so I had no choice but to continue taking the cough syrup that taste so awful. I’m gonna rinse my mouth later. Can’t believe I used to like syrup medicine more then pills  tablet. But in any case, I rather live my life without them. I’m sure you agree with me, medicines are just so yucky. Everyone take care hor, especially with the haze around. I’m going to rinse my mouth and rest le… TaTa everyone…
