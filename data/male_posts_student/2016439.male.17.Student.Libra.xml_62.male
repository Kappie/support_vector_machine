I'm really going to miss the two people we're losing from the staff for next year.  Our editor-in-chief has been amazing: she's a golden-hearted person who's been a source of unlimited support this year; she will be missed by all, I'm sure.  The other, our sports editor, has been awesome to hang out with.  She's really fun, a bit naive at times, but cool.  It's been fun joking around with her, and although there was a couple-week spell where things were a little tense, everything worked out.  I'm really not sure what to expect about newspaper next year.  There are a couple of people I'm not looking forward to coming on staff, but others that I'm truly psyched about joining.  On top of all that, Mrs. B, our adviser, will be off having a baby when we're trying to put together our first issue (I mean, come on; having a baby, which millions of woman around the globe do every day, or getting out the first issue of the  Panther Post .  Jeez.), so it'll be hard with a sub for the first month or so.  I'm sure we'll pull it together, though.  Hopefully.  Maybe.  Oh crap.  Speaking of missing people, though, it's going to be strange going through this summer.  I mean, most of my friends and I rarely hang out over the summer because our schedules usually conflict; nevertheless, we always find time near the end to get back together and enjoy good times stress-free.  I always miss hanging out with them because, in essence, I'm alone for most of the summer.  True, I have many activities in which I'm involved (i.e. last summer's MOWW conference and the Stanford Experience), but I rarely get to spend time with people I'd actually like to hang around.  Wow, that sounded a lot worse than I wanted it to, but it's kind of true.  I love getting to meet people at all of the new, fun summer adventures, but it's never like hanging out with your best friends.  However, this summer will be markedly special because my family will be having our second family reunion (we have them every other year).  I love getting to see everyone, especially since we're so spread out over the country.  The only bad side is that due to band camp on weekdays, I'll only have a weekend to spend with my family.  Suck.  Speaking of band (man, I'm rocking on segways tonight), yes, I did manage to sneak on in into a drum major spot (haha, sort of an inside thing if you know why), and joining me will be a good friend of mine Anna D.  It's going to be strange with only two next year because this year we had three, and...well...change is WRONG, man!  It's WRONG!!!  Er...actually, no.  I'm quite excited about next year because we're going to be underclassman-heavy, which means I'll be able to exert that I'm-so-superior-to-you-simply-because-I-was-born-a-year-or-two-or-three-earlier-than-you attitude.  People with that attitude have always bothered me.  The last week is upon us.  Bring it on!  Again!
