Do you take things for granted, that you will see your friend again or do you actually treasure every single moment spent with that companion.      When you smile, do you actually realise what you are doing? You can either be making somebody's day turn from bad to good or.. You could just be cheating the person if you didnt mean the smile. People see me smile, hear me laugh, but can they be sure it is for real? Have they ever stopped to think, wait a minute, he can't be laughing at this can he?       Personally, i take the good with the bad and whatever the situation, i believe in smiling. Even if its a forced smile where i have to cram up the corners of my lips, i force myself to do so. If i really have to force myself to smile i am in fact contradicting myself but i will do so because one sad person is enough... The world is full of sad faces, take the time to look around. Enjoy the lush scenery you see and ignore the frowns. Smile and be greeted with another smile and slowly, slowly all will be back in place....      "As people age, As people grow,   They lose their sense, they make more foes.   Frowns a plenty, mostly blamed on responsibility,    Life they say, has taken such a toll.   Childish are acts which seem insensible to them,   but whose to say whose grown up when?   All one can do is smile and wait,    time will tell, chase your fate."
