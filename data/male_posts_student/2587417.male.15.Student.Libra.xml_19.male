Im in Computer Apps right now and I am sitting here listeing to people talk about trips... god it is boring... but of course, it is the ed of the year but of course, some of these could be alot shorter.... cause 15 minutes on the same place gets kinda old...  then again, Mike isn't even done with his so I guess I am lucky I am already done.   Manga + Courtney Love = ????   The hell is TOKYOPOP thinking... a Manga staring Courtney Love... not thats not Japanese, or Korean, or AMerican for that matter, that is just scary... scary as hell... but of course, it could be worse... Tom Cruise cuold be the damn starring character... not that would suck even more....  Mike thinks he aint gonna present his powerpoing project today... ha, what a moron.... and he cant even do his powerpoint presentation right!!! I need ti study for finals but /i would rather play DDR instead   I need some money!!  i need some money to buy some things... like anime DVDs... and some Manga... and god... lets see... ssome CDs... a No-Region DVD Player... um... a new computer... soem LED Fans... oh yea... bawls, lots of it.... some duct tape... ok lots of duct tape... some imported things ffrom asia... like cd, dvds and a dvd player (didn't i say that already)...
