Yesterday I finally broke down and stayed home to make sure that I didn't carry this stuff into the weekend or next week, yet my brother still seems to think that I'm faking for some reason.   At school I actually went ahead and tried to run for senior student council (or dance committee) representative for no reason whatsoever. I guess I just thought I needed some sort of leadership experience that would be good on applications and the like, but that shouldn't be a reason to do anything. The election was today, so I guess I'll see how I did on Monday. In my Precalculas/Trigonometry class I recently took perhaps the most difficult test this year (analytical trigonometry), and despite my lack of studying and my complete disorientation due to illness, I somehow scored a 95% (second highest in the class). It's sort of ironic how I received my best test score on the most difficult test of the year, and under less than ideal circumstances nonetheless.  Throughout the week I have been meddling in some various photography projects, both for school and with my personal camera at home. First, as I previously mentioned, I borrowed a Lomo Compact-Automat camera from school and shot a roll of color slide film for a class project, as well as a roll of color film for myself. Nate also went out and shot a roll of color and B film because he has been eager to experiment with a Lomo ever since he heard of them a while back. My color slide film turned out surprisingly well for my first use with the camera, but for some reason the images didn't have too much of a vignetting effect (darkening of the edges)  as I have seen in most of the Lomo photographs online. Nate and I are still waiting for our other rolls of film to be processed.   My other photo project was with my Canon telephoto lens that I had not previously experimented with. The prints from that little test also came out surprisingly well. Hopefully I will be able to put together a photoblog sometime in the next year so I can share some of my photographs, but I guess until then I can get a head-start on the whole deal by compiling as many images as possible.  Now that the weekend has finally come around I will hopefully get some rest, and possibly go see  urlLink  Kill Bill Vol. 2   with my brothers. I'll probably also continue watching some of the NHL playoff games, as I have been doing over this past week with my family. Although I haven't really picked a team that I want to win, I can't pass up the chance to see such great games. My dad was trying to make plans to go see a production of "Godspell" this weekend, but he quickly found out that it wasn't exactly the same version of the play that he is familiar with, so he decided to cancel the whole deal.
