Apparently these chemicals are not entirely broken down when digested and end up in the waste water; some of the material survives treatment and ends up in ground water. A spokeswoman for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which includes the DWI, said: â€œIt is extremely unlikely that there is a risk, as such drugs are excreted in very low concentrations and biodegraded during sewage treatment and in watercourses. I would have thought that DWI stood for Drinking Water Inoculated had I not read that it stood for Drinking Water Inspectorate. Expectorate? Perhaps I was within spitting distance of the truth.
