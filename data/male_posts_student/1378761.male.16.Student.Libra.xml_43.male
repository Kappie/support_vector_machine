I went to go get my check, and then had to get gass because my fuel light was on!  Then i had to be to work at 5:30-close, which wasnt too bad since I got to be manager and didnt have to go any cleaning! haha i left that to the lil pee-on's that work there!(eric) hehe!  Well while i was doing paperwork, talked to eric, and decided to go out and do something! OK, now remember he got out of there 20 minutes before i did! And i went home got in the shower, did make-up all that good stuff, and he was still only 10 minutes ahead of me!  Good lord it takes that kid a long time to get ready! Well, eric picked me up and we went cruising around, really just talking the whole time! -about work, life, annoying ppl- you know what i am talking about, the normal stuff!  Eric decides that i am being a bad girl and decides to take his dang handcuffs and handcuff me!  He takes me out to the lake and tells me i am going to go swimming, well bad idea! i pick up the wet mushy sand and threw it all over eric, and his car! haha it was the highlite of my day! it was freaking hilarious, he was wigging out, omg i was dying laughing!  Finally, i get the handcufss taken off and i make a run for the sand once more! BAM- more sand on eric's car!  After we both calmed down, we sat and talked! haha wat else is new, cant ever get eric to shut up!  We drove around for a lil bit longer and he took me home!  Nothing too exciting happened today! have a good nite everyone! -ash-
