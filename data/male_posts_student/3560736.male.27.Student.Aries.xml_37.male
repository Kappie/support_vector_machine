I'm not entirely convinced of this. We're always looking for the "G factor" (the Genius factor) and hopefully identifying some method of spotting it through physical observation. Einstein's brain was famously sliced and diced appart till very little of it remains today in the search for what made him a genius. Was it the size? (No.) Was it the shape? (Qualified no - more folds in the surface are also semi-correlated to intelligence.) Was it density? (No.) Bloodflow? (Qualified no - lack of bloodflow definitely leads to damage, but isn't correlated to intelligence necessarily.) Metabolism? (No.)  The interesting thing to keep in mind is that very few people could qualify as a genius in multiple fields of endeavor. Genius in one and very competent in another, yes. Genius in one and semi-genius in a related field, yes. Genius in two completely separate fields of endeavor, not really.  Psychology is such a complex science, there are just so many factors to consider and look for. Just as I don't believe we'll ever truly be able to generate artificial intelligence, I don't think we'll be able to pin down things like genius, creativity or personality. Sure, we might be able to go so far as to see how individual neurons interact with other neurons and in what manner and with what chemicals and so forth - but we'll never be able to fully understand why that particular interaction can produce a Beethoven symphony or a theory of relativity, or even the desire to love another.  And if nothing else - even if I live to be 120 or more years old - I'll never see AI or the type of understanding of the brain talked about here in my lifetime.
