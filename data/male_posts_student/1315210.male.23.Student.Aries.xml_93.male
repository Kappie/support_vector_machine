"If ya got it, Flaunt it.........."    this does not just apply to the good stuff such as a perky butt or muscular body.............as long as it is not offensive to others, why not flaunt it? so wat if you are larger than life? flaunt it~! give yourself some confidence...........live it up alittle.............  and on to my last substantial post...............i have finally found out how chickens get bird flu............i thought of it while driving home today..................there were a few trucks transporting cages and cages of chickens..............and guess what? it started to rain!!!! and the cages were not covered, so the poor chickens were getting drenched in the rain........so there u have it.............bird flu~!!!! exciting isnt it?
