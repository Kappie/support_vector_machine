After 20 minutes on the bike, I realized I could do more. I  wanted  to do more. So I got on the treadmill and ran a mile.  :-)  Fun times. I think I'm starting to nauseate family and friends with my enthusiasm.  (Check out the MP3 player  urlLink link  for some hilarious Korean-to-English mistranslation.)
