Anyways, GTA San Andreas comes out in October and if I could discribe this game in one word is "depth".  This game will be so realistic, it will blow all the other GTA copiers (True Streets of LA and what not) out of the water.  Let's get the stuff you probably already know out of the way: More weapons, but not too much, the makers of GTA refuse to add shit like lasers into the game and I agree.  What they are going to mainly focus on is fixing the feel of previous weapons and targeting.  There will be a couple new weapons though.  New vehicles of course. To correspond with the 90's LA type thing there will be many low-riders, not much has been said about that motorcyles and other two wheelers except the fact bicycles will be a new vehicle, which will probably turn out to be a very fun time.  Now for the crazy stuff that will blow you away.  You now don't have to go solo on your machines, you can recruit yourself a gang and go out and shoot the place up, also you can do drive-bys with 4 people hangning out the windows shooting away.  Interiors to houses is now in GTA, a prime part of this GTA will be breaking into houses and stealing things.  More areas to tear up.  There are restaurants to eat at which they began to do in Vice City but this is way more in depth.  If you eat too much fast food, you will actually get fatter.  People will call you "fat bastard" as well, and your stamina will decrease accordingly.  How do you get back in shape?  Just like in real life, go to the gym, and tone your body.  There will be 3 seperate cities just like before, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Francisco (different names will be used in the game).  The difference is that there is countryside between these cities.  Think about it, driving out of Los Angeles, past smaller and smaller rural areas, over a MOUNTAIN (yes there will be mountains) and eventually into Las Vegas.  You may realize now how huge that San Andreas's world will be.  There will be so much to explore, it is mind-boggling.  Ok, that's all I have to say about that, I am tired...
