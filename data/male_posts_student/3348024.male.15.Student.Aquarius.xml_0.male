Upon our arrival we were greeted by a crazy woman named Amy, who claimed to be my cousin... not the cousin I remember.. *shakes fist angrily. Our arrival time was exactly 2:34 p.m. central time zone.(The clock in our car struck 2:34 as we pulled into the driveway, and we have the most precise clock known to mankind.)  Upon arrival, this character, who I will refer to as Amy, showed us through her house and pointed out the problems that we would have to fix while we were there.  My dad made a list of stuff he needed as she pointed stuff out.  After the tour, I sat down in the living room and played the guitar that was waiting to be played.  I played that shit up... 'cept it was wildly out of tune.  I had to curb my anger and refrain from bitch slapping that guitar.  I calmly searched for a tuner because unlike Karthik, I don't have the eyes of a fox and cannot tune it by ear.  Maybe it's because the bitch never showed me how to tune w/ harmonics.  Well, I'll show that foreign kid...  I didn't find one and by the time I was tired of looking and bugging amy to find it, those Kray Z kidz(my parents, amy, and my older brother were ready to go to lowes.  Lowes was pretty boring until we started looking at the lights.  We were looking at some recessed lights for amy's kitchen when some dude, with annoyingly blonde hair and a lisp came up in our grill and asked if he could help us.(for future reference I will refer to him as Mr. Garrison)  My dad was looking at some lights and couldn't figure out how they attatched to the ceiling so he asked Garrison how they attatch to the ceiling.  Mr. Garrison proceded to take the light from my dad, lift it above his head so the light part was pointing down, and say, "It goes in like this."  Well, thanks, jackass, you've been a real fucking help.  We got kicks outta that one for the rest of the night. We returned at a quarter after five.  I played guitar for about 15 minutes before Tim came home...  Then, I played for 45 more.  Then I went to sleep and ate cookies.    Sunday was Kray Z.  On Sunday, My dad and Tim finished up a electric project and we went to play frisbee golf... We stopped by a sporting goods store to buy the frisbees for the game and on our way out we heard a tornado siren.  The weather didn't seem to be too bad so we headed over to the course.  We played about 12 holes with out any incident, but when we got the the 13th. the rain started coming down harder and harder.  It was pouring by the time we finished the hole so we started running back to the car.  We all ended up thoroughly soaked by the time we ran the mile back to the car.  We arrived home to find Amy and my mother in the basement heeding the tornado warnings.  They yelled at us saying they were scared shitless and all that jazz.  Then today was pretty boring, but I did get a couple good hours of guitar playing in...
