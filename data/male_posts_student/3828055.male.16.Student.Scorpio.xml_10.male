There was the obligatory "Hey, you're home, let's party!" partying, and some rockin' with Beermouse (we've got our first show coming up on the 19th - Masonic Temple in Oakville - be there). I saw the friends who needed seeing the most and tried to keep my Shadditudeous spirit alive. To that end I have done something, I guess. I've written down my goals for the next 6 months, next 6 weeks, and the next month. They're all pretty much the same, but different stages in the development of each goal.  I've begun talks with a friend on starting up a design firm: he has an incredible eye for design, but no business skills whatsoever. I guess I don't either, really, but Shad's taught me enough, so with that and my parents' extensive library of business literature I should be fine.  My band's starting to grow. As I said, we're playing our first show on the 19th. I plan on bringing a lot of the planning and management skills I learned at Carleton back into the band. Not the band as a creative entity, rather the band as a business. My goal for the next six months: Grow Beermouse (that's the band, folks - pure rock'n'roll) to the point where it will be a viable goal to be mothafuckin' RAWK stars by the end of high school (or, for some of the other members, the end of Grade 12 or the end of Grade 10).  As you may have noticed by either the frequency or length of the posts I'm writing, I've also resolved to write everyday. I think I posted that last time, but it's worth saying again, if only to reinforce the discipline into  my  mind. I'll have to write everyday for the Writer's Craft course I'm taking first semester, so I figure I might as well start now. Practise up  before  it counts for marks.  I've begun to run again. My time for 3.5 km: 18 minutes, give or take 30 seconds. That was the very first time, after having not done any training since early June. My time for 3.5 km at the end of last summer, after having trained since May: 17.5 minutes, give or take 30 seconds. Truly a testament to mind over matter, really (or, more proof that the universe is all within my head and I truly am master of all that I survey). This is to help towards my goal of exercising everyday in order to improve my overall physical fitness. I don't really care about how I look; if I  feel  good, then the looks will follow. Form follows functionality, afterall.  There are other goals, but they are (for the most part) boring to others and interesting only to me. Well, that's how I'm rationalizing it. They're upstairs on my desk and I don't feel like going to get them right now. Maybe I'll post them here on the next update.  Speaking of the next update, here's a sneak-peak:     What Shad Taught Me: The Importance of Failure   Ooo, looks cool, doesn't it? Knew you'd be enticed. Next time, on The Cary Show: That thing above, and I explain today's crazy title!  Buh-bye from the basement, - Cary (aka Donut O)
