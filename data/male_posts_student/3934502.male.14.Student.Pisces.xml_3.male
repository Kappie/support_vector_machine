Anyways, the highlight of the day was that my class got selected to support the Judo Championships. Our classmate Ming Xuan (or also known as Lee Jiao Lian or Mao Wang) was one of the competitors and he managed to win over his opponent! But in the end, Chinese High had the power of numbers (and flags) and we lost. Damn them! Fortunately, RJC won in the A division boys, and since that was the most important one, we could just as well take comfort in it. But that competition was a hell lot less violent then we expected, and probably more injuring.The RGS judokas literally got held down by the pure force of the weight of their competitors - you should see the weight difference! On one side were the RGS judokas, normally-built for their category and on the other hand were the elephants of the C division girls. Bam! All they had to do was lie down and the RGS judokas couldn't get up. Oh well, back to sleep... Again... Zzz...
