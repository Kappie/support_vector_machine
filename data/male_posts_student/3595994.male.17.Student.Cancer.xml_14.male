"fight" literally. the argue over.. funny things la.. things that are not meant to be argue over.. yes.. its that jealousy that brought her to such trouble ( according to her ). Jacklynn told gavin ( just as what she has told me ) , that she will leave his life forever.... yes.. and now they are "stranger". hai~!......    WHAT!!!

Y!!! y must this things happen again! y him ? y him ? she did that hurtful things to mi le... now his turn! .... hai~! i wrote a poem to say out my feeling.( though it sux la)  When autum goes, and winter comes, true friend will stay, no matter what has been done.  Those who can't stand the big wind blow, Can't withstand the rush river flow, has their heart once full of joy, turned sorrow.  Red roses turned brown, promises turned to lies. When smile turns to frown, even she turned into passer-by.  When she cares too much, it can be a disaster. It comes to a point which spells  - stranger.   -yit hann    yea! .. hai~!... ya if u wanna know abt the story ..... curosity kills the cat... ok fine, if u claim that u were never the cat.. go to his blog and see the thingy lo!     haha  ok aniway!..
