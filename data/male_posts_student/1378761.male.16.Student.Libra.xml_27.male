I had to close friday, I was only suppose to work untill 6 but the manager wanted me to stay because of some other problems with Jesse, one of the other employees working that night. So I stayed and closed, wich it did'nt matter to much because everyone was at the b-ball game against Celina so it did'nt work out too bad. I guess Jesse did'nt get down untill like 9:15, when we close at 8, on a slow Tuesday night so thats why I had to close.  I really did'nt do too much more that night. Drove around thats pretty much it.  For now, Eric
