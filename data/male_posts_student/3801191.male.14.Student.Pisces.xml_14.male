Their belongings emerge From a hidden dimension Delivered to them On a musty suspension  The little girl Stands behind the barriers of glass Seperatd from those she holds dear A tear breaks Rolling down her petite cheek  A courtroom of emotions A jury of silent witnesses In their hearts, they cry  In an instant The barriers are shattered The floodgates are opened  Reunion
