Windows is taking Lindows to court because they say Lindows sounds too much like Windows.  Either Microsoft is worried Lindows may be a formidable opponant or they are simply trying to make some extra cash.  I feel a tad bit sorry for Lindows.  But only a tad.  After all, Lindows is having a 'Hack into the X-Box contest'.  X-Box is made by Microsoft.  I find the whole ordeal mildly funny.  But only mildly.  It's almost more scary and sad than funny.  Where is the line drawn on what lawsuits can be about?  What if I get sued?   Like I said - It's funny, but mainly just plain scary.
