I called at 6.00pm (that's what time the chemist shuts) and they said they have room for me. Well how helpful. I went in and he started poking my eye, saying he 'wanted to get some gunk out of swollen bit'! PRICK! As if it doesn't take the piss enough that I have to go through a whole night of agony before I can pick up my prescription! Ah sorry. I can only see out of one eye right now. The vision in my right eye is completely blurry. All day I have just wanted to fall asleep in Mandy's arms.
