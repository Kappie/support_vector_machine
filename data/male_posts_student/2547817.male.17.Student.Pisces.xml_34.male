It'd be a crying shame if she didn't. She knows that I still love her. However she donen't wanna tell me if the sentiment is reciprocated. Wonder what that means.  I will let time take it's course. Thy will be done.  I have to stop swearing, but the more I do, the more I tend to see Christianity as following blindly what an old book says. Believing in something that cannot be proven. I don't know lah.  Think about this. Because I'm Christian, I'm saved eternally. Eternally meaning timeless. Therefore, when I go to heaven, I'd immediately got to know who made it there Coz everyone would be there already. However, for everyone to be there already, time would have to have passed for everyone to be there already wouldnt it? And even then, when would judgement day be? So is heaven still timeless. Heaven is devoid of time and space. But then, where would the roads of gold go? If they're only descriptions of whatheaven is like, then how much of the bible is comprised of mere "descriptions"?  I don't mean to sway anyone, but I was just thinking.
