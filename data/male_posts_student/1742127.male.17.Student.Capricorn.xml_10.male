LoL It first started out with all of us in the school, but of course the school looked different. Then we went to the cafe' for lunch. But we were all ticked cuz a bunch of Jr. High Graham Girls came over to eat lunch there and they kept going back into the kitchen trying to get their food and we were like DUDE WAIT! My GoSH! LoL Then we went back to the school and there was a huge storm coming! (of course, for those of you who don't know, I dream about storms and tornadoes alllllll the time....) Well, I'm trying to go home to get ready for the F-ball game that night, but my Jeep starts acting weird, like was all churning and rocking and making this grinding noise, and I hit someonme's car but didn't tell them, and my mom replaced the jeep with this new fangled neo jeep.. lol don't even think that's real, but I was ticked cuz it was uglier than the jeep. Anways, we all go to the gym to meet our new coach and work out for the new official day of school, but being the name Coach Libby I dreamed he was a girl with white poofy hair. LoL But Jodi gathered all the cheerleaders in a corner and was trying to make us figure out our poses for our upcoming cheerleading pictures. LoL It was FUNNY!  But anyways... lol.... the story of Mikey and I's relationship is a little funny. We started going out in the 8th grade up until the 9th grade.... a full year. We broke up and didn't go out or anything til almost a full year..ish... and started going out again. One day I'll count up the days. It'll be worth it. :)  Well, I'm gonna go. Later! ~ChRiStIn
