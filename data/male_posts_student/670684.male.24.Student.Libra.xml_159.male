And George Bush is doing a good job?  The  urlLink website  is slowly coming along, with the bulk of progress resting on the Essays page; if anyone is interested in seeing what I am filming as a final this semester, Daniel Abrego and I are working on  urlLink looking at whether people change once they win the money .  Interesting topic...tough to turn from abstract to concrete, but we're dealing with fun issues.  WOOT!    I'd say I am going to work on this website over the break and get more aspects running, but who am I kidding?  I'll write some screenplay, do some doc film, and drink a bit.  Maybe some RISK as well.  Everquest too?
