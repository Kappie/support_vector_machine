I've just restarted this old thing (which had previously died o' leprosy), so I'd better find something to say...  Ok, then. I was supposed to be going al cinema tomorrow, avec Mel, aber now she cannae make it, Cap'n, which is shit. Shit shit shit, with a capital fuck. But still, can't be helped. Instead, come round, all ye copains à moi, and we can play D all through the day, weeeeeeeee. Or not, maybe. Up to you. I could do with getting some revision done, as I have a German Oral on Tuesday and I have done fick alle revision. Ah well, I'll get by, I always have before (not being smug, quoting Evita).  Ach, well. Il n'y a rien à dire, vraiment. I'll be blogging more frequently now, my lovelies, Scott.
