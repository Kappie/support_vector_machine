Amazingly, at this hour I am still feeling awake and my mind is right now still whirling from the movie... certainly, it is a good movie with much food for thought. Peter Parker... the anti hero, for most of the movie, was trying to take away the part of himself which he think is taking away or sacrificing his other desires and dreams. After spending a huge proportion of the movie trying to find his own identity, at the end of it, he accepted his calling as Spiderman...  As I watched the show, I couldn't help but draw certain comparisons to my own Christian walk with God. Hmmm... how sometimes circumstances will put us in places where we never thought that God will take us to, and then, we need to make a choice whether to accept the destiny that God has placed upon us or to walk away from it all for our own dreams. It's amazing on how at the end of the show, that he get what he wants (Mary Jane) and also fulfill the destiny that he has been placed upon.   Certainly, as I was watching the movie, I coul;dn't help but remember a verse in the bible, that God has "made everything beautiful in its time". When we begin to yield ourselves to God for His purpose, He will certainly always brings the best into our lives. Nothing, can ever change that fact that God has made everything beautiful in its time, that in the right season, the blessings and desires that we want will always be given to us.
