This thing about my quest lately to smell very good, I really can't explain....I guess it can all be traced back to the first time my lil sister Nina took me to Sephora....I swear in all my visits to Lenox I never paid much attention to the store....I thought it was a makeup store or something (I was partially correct)....I had no idea of the wealth of "smell goods" out there for guys....so I decided to give it a shot....I spent about an hour in there testing smells....and I was hooked....  The first fragrance I ever wore regularly was Cool Water....Like many a weak mind I was influenced by music, I heard Snoop Dogg talk about it....I said hey let's try it....I think Curve was in style at the time....I didn't care though....I liked Cool Water....I eventually ran out of that smell and I was given Polo Sport as a gift....along with an imposter Tommy (never took more than three sprays of it and I can't even tell you where it is now)....  I quickily got a bottle of Hugo Boss and that immediately jumped to number 1....it had a nice sweet smell to it that I really liked on me....and the ladies liked it too....then this Christmas Nina gave me a bottle of Issey Miyake....I learned an important lesson from that....always let a lady pick your cologne....ALWAYS.....I swear I got more compliments from the smell of Issey than I have ever gotten before....I was hooked.....at about this time I also got into the Bath  Body works shower gels....I have always been partial to the smell of vanilla so I bought two bottles of that, a bottle of coconut, and a bottle of cucumber melon....  Recently I have purchased Carolina Herrara 212 (a good counter balance to the Issey, also suggested by Nina) and a shower gel/cologne set from the LaCoste boutique....it has a fresh smell for spring....I figure I'll use that in opposition to the Polo Sport....I also like the fact that I can be virtually assured that no one else in the Nashville area has this fragrance....nothing like the feeling of smelling UNIQUELY good....  Coming soon....another recent obsession....good ties and their importance....
