I'm not looking forward to the Air TransCRAP flight, but there ya go!  Weather has been good today! Bit overcast nowI went to Wal Mart and bought a pencil case and ruler for school! Cost me £1.50 so I was pleased!  Packed my suitcase, everything fits (thank God!). I came to work out the tax that I can claim back. THE STUPID CANADIAN GOVERNMENT ONLY ALLOWS TAX BACK ON PURCHASES OF $50 OR MORE. So I had Olivia's iPod and the fishing license recipts and thats it - $26.54 of tax - £8 roughly! Cheapskates!  So I'm off now to have the Salmon I caught on Thursday, BBQ Stylee!  **L8RS** OH CANADA!
