It's basically bands from the 60s and 70s such as Grateful Dead, the Band, Janis Jop, and others that went on a tour through Canada by train during the summer or 1970. And for 30 years since the shows, tapes and footage got lost, but recently was found and made into a movie. And a damn good one!  You gotta catch this one, man. It's hard to explain how good it was, but it made me go to my garage, and blow the roof off with guitar-solos ALL NIGHT! So, hope you feel that way too.
