Will get them up as soon as I'm free from study.  Been spending time with   Da Man   and   Nigel   over the last week. One is out of leave, which is always a momentous event with his work schedule, and the other is out on school holiday. Being a good friend and brother, I felt it was only right that I make some time out from studying to spend time with them. In fact, I was with them on the first show for the Matrix Revolutions on opening day.  Speaking of Matrix Revolution, I will need to post up my views and full review of it and the Trilogy as a whole. The critics and peer reviews have been really bad and scalding. While I do think it is a little disappointing, nevertheless it is a must see at the very least as a form of closure and a fitting end to first movie.
