Its possible my post was simply too large and the site wouldn't accept it. Nevertheless, I've decided to post it here instead, because it brings up some important pragmatic points as well as engaging a little in the queer theory side of things, which is something that has been conspicuously missing, I think, in lots of 'insider' commentary. The sum total usually appears to be 'not all of us  want  to get married!'. Apart from any other problems I, and others, have with such a statement, it is also a reductionist point of view and actually plays into the argument that an issue of gay rights (I'm still to investigate more fully the overlap between gay rights, marriage, and human rights) can be concieved within a  utilitarian  framework. Surely it is laziness and  political passiveness  that bridges the antithetical liberalist notion of 'rights' with some kind of utilitarian calculus.  My intended post to the  Write to Latham and Roxon  thread was as follows:    I have written to both Howard and Latham, though I anticipate Roxon's immunity as 'just the messenger' even at the same time I reject it.  I whole heartedly agree with Doug Pollard regarding the creation of a national, permanent, centralised GLBTI council in Canberra. In fact, the idea seems so obvious I wonder why I've never heard it before (never been that active in the gay community, though, so I'm not sure if its an old idea or not, perhaps I should look into it). I haven't been in the activist game for long, but I'm happy to do what I can for such a worthy, and needed, endeavour.  Labour's reversal has indeed left many of us wondering where on earth to send our votes, but I suggest that spiting Labour by voting Liberal may not be the most coherent response. Despite Labour's atrocious betrayal of not only the GLBTI community, but also the secular, liberal, democratic model of government we are supposed to have in this country, I still believe they are far more likely to move on the issue in the future than the Liberal party, and voting Democrat or Green anywhere but in the Senate really just increases Liberal's chance of a fourth term.  IMO, a strong Democrat and Greens presence in the Senate is at the moment our best option by far. All you need to do is read some of the Hansard debates by Liberal members over the past week to see that no Liberal Senator deserves a single, solitary GLBTI vote.  I have been meaning to find out if the Senate Committee is still going to report or not. Does anyone know?  Matt Currie - you present a relevent argument, and I believe it has merit and certainly a place in the debate. However, I take a more pragmatic, somewhat less esoteric/academic approach.   The gay rights movement itself, as you point out, is not a unified one, and what exactly the gay rights agenda should push for varies from person to person. Inclusion into �classic� heterosexual institutions, such as the �family�, are seen by some as objectives of dubious value. This is true even of the struggle for same-sex marriage. However, the legal advantages and practicalities of marriage (in taxation, government benefits, intestacy, criminal testimony, insurance, hospital visitation, etc.), as well as its capacity to translate the concept of �gay love� into a language heterosexuals can understand �and thereby be forced to reconcile� is for some reason enough to pursue it .  Conversely, some argue that gay marriage will actually contribute to gay invisibility and oppression by inculcating homosexuals into the mainstream, thereby undermining �the goals of gay liberation�  � which is in most cases a struggle for sexual liberation and freedom from the trappings of institutionalised power relationships and role conformism.  While the latter opinion is certainly still in evidence, gay men and lesbians who choose to reject some aspects of �gay liberation�, those who dismiss the liberationist�s strict repugnance for private sexuality and have personally rejected or grown out of the liberation-through-promiscuity edict of the movement, the reasons for marriage have become mostly pragmatic. Any political statements two men or two women marrying each other may convey, though capable of lessening the bitterness of past institutionalised repression, has become a secondary concern.  In this respect, and for those in favour of gay marriage, the gay rights agenda seems to have moved past attempting to indoctrinate the masses with the fact that we exist, and instead have begun to focus on the integration of the gay identity to become a less radical aspect of (dare it be said) normal society. Indeed, the integration of homosexual unions into law, where it has occurred (the Canadian and American examples are the most well known to me), has not been the result of a judicial or legislative specifically pro-gay agenda, but rather a matter of basic civil liberties extending to more of extant society in general.  To this I would add that a war of numbers has no place in a human rights debate. Even if only 1% of gay people wanted to get married, it is still a matter of equality that is worth pursuing.  I suppose, though, to be fair, you're not arguing against gay marriage, but rather are questioning the self-conceptions that wanting gay marriage may illustrate. I suppose its an all or nothing situation; can we really want gay marriage and yet be conservatively resistant to an evolution of the gay identity that may eventuate when it is achieved?  Individuality is within the person, not the sexuality.
