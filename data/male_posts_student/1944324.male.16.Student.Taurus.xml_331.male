However Thomas does not lend his name to a semi-hilarious Sports Night reference, Ergo "Erin's Coming, Hide Your Heart Girl.  JournalCon. Tomorrow at Six. Michael's House. E-mail me  urlLink here   for additional information and stuff.  PS I have  Chicago . And by the way movies and stuff need to be italicized 'cause I thought Marten wanted to go to Chicago for a JournalCon, which would be...easy, now that I know the secret entrance (Stony Island Avenue!) but expensive to say the least.   However it would be cool...  History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.
