I opened up this page Friday night, and Saturday night, and I kept on telling myself that I'd write something, but I didn't really feel in a writing mood.  Now I am.  So here's the story from A to Z.  Friday's rounds of exams were probably the weirdest yet.  I managed to do marginally better in the classes that I neglected.  And I also managed to possibly get screwed in neuro.  Not screwed per se, but I don't think I managed to get a high A.  Oh well.  Competition is on though, time to put the NY'ers in their place, lol.  It's friendly, don't worry about it ;)  My roommate and the guys all went to St. Maarten again!  I don't think these guys know when to stop partying!  If only I could write about all the crazy things they did there, lol.  I, however, was at Nitin's house for practically all of Saturday.  Nitin and I were the chef's for the evening.  We cooked some chicken wings, potatoes and some mushroom thing (Nitin's idea) for everyone (Dan, Dave, Nick, Chelsee, Nitin and I).  We then watched Spiderman 2!!  What a fantastic movie!  See it! :)  After the movie, I had a wonderful realization.  I noticed that my wallet was missing!  We scoured Nitin's house to no avail, as well as his car and surrounding areas.  Nothing.  Then, I decided to just go back to the dorms to see if the night watchman was out and hopefully let me into my room.  Luckily, he was, though when I got back to my room, my wallet was not on my desk!  It wasn't on my bed, and wasn't in any of my pockets.  At this point, I'm sweating and pretty much freaking out.  This is the last place in the world that a person would want to be without all their important cards.  Then, as I'm walking out, I had a feeling (psychosis?) telling me to go back and look at my roommates desk.  Lo and behold, my wallet! Woot!  So here's what happened.  When Nitin picked me up in the morning, he asked for a drink as we were leaving (and my wallet was in my hand).  What I did is that I set it down on my roommate's desk, grabbed his drink and walked out.  It didn't even cross my mind that I had forgotten it as I had just had it in my hands minutes earlier, and didn't even think about it until I was about to go home.  So lesson of the day, aside from not being stupid like me, don't forget your wallet anywhere ;)  Today was pretty much uneventful.  When the guys got back from St. Maarten, we headed over to Sunshine's for some dinner.  When we got there, I saw for the first time, what I have never ever seen on Nevis before.  Yes, I saw a hot looking woman, lol.  I'm sorry, I know, I know, but sights like that around here are quite rare!  Anyhow, as luck would have it, they were only serving drinks, and the kitchen was closed for the evening.  It's ok though, we anticipated it anyhow, so we went over to Mem's Pizza and I had a large pizza to myself.  Ok, you're asking how I could eat a large pizza.  It wasn't really "large".  A "large" pizza around here is about the size, if not smaller than a "small" pizza back home ;)  Well, that's about it for now.  31 days till I'm back in T.O.!  And I still miss you JL!  Ok, bye bye bye.
