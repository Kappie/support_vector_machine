Hhhanywayz, im goin to Oakland on Saturday night and coming back probly Monday afternoon. Im jus goin to c my relatives, and my mom jus likes to plan random trips, shez crazy. I might post stuff lata so...paaaaaaaaacye.  This Weekz Grade: B  Insight: All around its been a pretty good week. If school was better then i would of probly put an A but i consider myself a tough critic.   urlLink My future college and my future teammates...maybe
