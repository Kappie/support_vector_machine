For halloween I dressed as Neo from The Matrix, everyone said I looked like Keannu Reeves. After school, the shittiest halloween ever. It was horrible because Paul made it that way. He made us play football. Then he went into town to buy eggs and practically didn't come back until night time. Then we went to Jared's where we planned on having fun running around egging things until Paul meets up with Crystal and John. So Ravin, I and Nolan just left a few times and stayed as far away from the gayness as possible. I cut my lip wrestling Paul and Ravin. Then at like 9, we decided to officially leave, it was Matt, Ravin, Nolan, Jason and me. We walked all the way to Stony Brook because we had no damn clue where we were. I almost got hit by a train. God damnit if we walked the railroad tracks we would have gotten to St. James alot quicker. We finally reached St. James town and ate at Rocco's pizza where the dude there was awesome giving us free drinks and shit. Good ol' Italians, they're so happy and peaceful. Then on our way out we say some dude in the car who was cursing randomly like he had terrets. He definetly was high and drunk. He's like NEO! And I'm like WHAT! and he's like IVE GOT A PROPHECY FOR YOU, IM THE ORACLE! and I'm like WHATS YOUR PROPHECY! and he's like IM GONNA BREAK YO FACE! It was hilarious. Then he started screaming Trinity. Then Nolan's dad picked us up and brought us back to Jared's where Jared and Paul claimed they had an awesome time doing shit with girls and they made a packed...how do you spell packed...packd...pact...anyways they made a pact and that's just horrible. I hate them. Everyone hated them that night. In fact on our walk we were talking about murdering Jared and Paul. Who makes a pact like that, they don't even know the girls it doesn't fuckin matter. Then I got picked up, thank heavens! I went straight to bed, then yesterday I hung out with Dan, Pat, Gavin and Ahmad. Dan drove me to Gavin's, I was so excited. We watched Gavin and his cousin do professional wrestling on Gavin's mattress and outside. Jesus they looked like they were killing each other but half the things didn't hurt because it was mostly fake. They kept bashing each other with cooking sheets, chairs and steal garbage lids. Gavin beat the shit out of his cousin and his cousin beat the shit out of him but the best move I saw was either Gavin's 3 kicker sending his cousin across the room or his cousin springing Gavin off his legs behind his bed frame, against the wall and then down to the ground. It was godlike. Then here comes the worst yet most fun part of the day. The rest of us decided to wrestle on camera but I hurt my neck and ouch. Then we went to Chris Corby's but he wasn't home so we got Mr. Olsen to pick us up and bring us back to Pat's. Then I had to go home and go to my cousin's to see my cousin Mike who came home from college. That was fun, Britt and I watched History of The World Part I. Then home again, then bed, now today the family is going to the Jets/Giant game and Kate and Britt will be coming over randomly today and Grandma is here to watch Alison. Yes, that's it, ok bye. Oh yes, Revolutions comes out in 2 days!
