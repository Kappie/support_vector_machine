And we hear that the most humiliating thing you can do is make one Arab male disrobe in front of another. Sounds to me like it's pretty thoughtful. Sounds to me in the context of war this is pretty good intimidation -- and especially if you put a woman in front of them and then spread those pictures around the Arab world. And we're sitting here, 'Oh my God, they're gonna hate us! Oh no! What are they gonna think of us?' I think maybe the other perspective needs to be at least considered. Maybe they're gonna think we are serious. Maybe they're gonna think we mean it this time. Maybe they're gonna think we're not gonna kowtow to them. Maybe the people who ordered this are pretty smart. Maybe the people who executed this pulled off a brilliant maneuver."  The White house, of course, refused to repudiate this shithead's attack on basic human dignity.  This man is obviously back on the Hillbilly Heroin.  What other explanation is there for this?  I am disgusted beyond words that anyone would think this, let alone say it on a nationally syndicated radio show.  Human life has no value at all to this sack of shit.  Way to confirm every bad thing ever said about America.  I hope they lock you up forever, with a 300 lb. muscular  Iraqi as a cellmate.  Thanks Rush, we'll blame the first five terrorist attacks on you.   urlLink Full Story , Registration Required.
