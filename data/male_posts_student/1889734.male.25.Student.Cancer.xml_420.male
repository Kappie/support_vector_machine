The last two hundred pages were a test of endurance.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Iain Banks is an author I discovered a few years ago, and he writes very interesting hard SF with high themes and interesting settings.  This one seems to promise a more nuanced character interaction, judging from the reviews.  I'm looking forward to it.
