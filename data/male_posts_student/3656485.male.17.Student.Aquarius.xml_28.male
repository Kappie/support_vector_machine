However, I am no chameleon. I rather consider myself to be a poser. Changing myself to appear as if I am one of you. Upon self discover, I keep finding this not to be true. You and I only have one great commonality. That being the desire for acceptance.  But how do we rid ourselves of this lust for companionship? My first answer would be to have companions. Mission accomplished. Now what? This is the answer that I lack. In an effort to try something new, I've made the decision to stop following people. That includes you. I will not smoke. I will not make fun of others. I will not keep interests in things that I have no interest in. Two monosyllabic words come to mind right now which I feel very well describe my notion. Fuck it. I don't need to worry about what some group thinks anymore, I shouldn't have ever had to.  The time has come to sift through my friends. To see who is and is not worth giving attention to. Those who give acceptance without the accompanying expectations of uniformity within their clickes must truly be the kind of company I desire. However, that may be an impossible persuit... For those who still abide by others rules, I hold nothing against you. I may very well be wrong. Society might only be held together by the bonds we fashion for ourselves. Alternatively, they may be the only walls holding us from reaching a higher level of spiritual achievement. Only time shall tell as we all create our own paths in life.  God, I'd like to have a chat with you when you have a couple minutes...
