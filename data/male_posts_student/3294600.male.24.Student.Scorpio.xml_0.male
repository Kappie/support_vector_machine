I woke up early and worked more on my room and got a lot accomplished.  By noon I figured I had been stood up and continued working on my room through the afternoon and chatted on-line as well.  Dale went over to talk with the landlords to see where we stand and if I could stay another month since he was paying the rent.  Their cold-heartedness continued and they said I had to be out.  Dale and I have decided that it's fine because I can still stay here as a friend.  I'm going to write a letter stating I'm paying him $.25 per day for storage until I can figure out what I'm able to do something with it all.  About 3ish Josh signed on-line and we talked for a bit and he still wanted to get together.  So I worked more on my room (to a presentable state), shaved, showered, and drove to Burlington and picked him up.  At first we were both shy but conversation happened.  We decided to go back to Smokey Point and hang out at Dale's.  We spent time getting to know eachother amd did some cuddling (Yeah for cuddling!).    I called Dale to let him know there would be company when he got home.  I asked him if he wouldn't mind getting a DiGernio(?) pizza, but he had already left work so he stopped at a local store.  I cooked the pizza and Josh and I ate together and Dale went to the computer room and chatted.  After pizza Josh and I went to bed; there was more cuddling! :)  We talked a lot and I fell asleep in his arms.  I woke up when he went to the bathroom and then was wide awake for few more hours.  It was nice to have someone spend the night with me.  This morning (Saturday) we woke up and even more cuddling! :)  We spent most of the morning sleeping, cuddling, and chatting.  It was very relaxing, but didn't help me get stuff done on my room.  At 1:30 this afternoon we left to take him home.  Dale was stood up today by a guy (poor Dale!) and he called to let me know.  We made arrangements to grab lunch/dinner when I got bck from taking Josh home to Job Corps in Sedro-Woolley.  Josh was worried about getting in trouble for spending the night, but he didn't.  Woohoo!    After I dropped him off, since I was already in Sedro-Woolley, I stopped at Randy's house.  For those of you who don't remember who Randy is, he is the one that was supposed to get my Dad's truck and buy it from me.  Well, the phone number had been disconnected and I couldn't get ahold of him.  I knew they were planning to move so I figured I would write down the address and mail it to the address and have it be forwarded.  As I pulled up and parked, there was a car there and people in the window.  Sure enough, it was Randy.  I kindly welcomed me and opened the door and invited me to stay for a bit.  I told him I was just passing by and we talked about the truck.    He said that he never got it and my Dad's landlord sold it to someone else and kept the money, allegidly because my Dad was a month behind.  That whole transaction is SOOOOO illegal!  He can't just sell my Dad's property.  The best thing I could have done was take the truck's title, which I still have.  Randy asked me if I had a key and I quickly said, "Uh, no, I gave it to you last time I was here."  He didn't remember that at all and his wife said, "I think this is the key."  Sure enough, it was.  He said, "I was even asking around who was the quickest hotwirer to go take it."  I told him to go get it and if he has any problems, call me, I'll call the Sheriff and report it stolen and that Randy is taking care of it for me until I can get up there.  I have the title and since I'm the only person that has rights to anything of my Dad's, he had no business selling it.  My Dad's dead and his life still continues to be complicated.  We made arrangements and instead of $600 for the next two months he's going to do $300 for the next 4 months.  His wife said, "Will money order be okay?"  I tried not to laugh and said, "Yeah, that would be perfect."  We'll see if around the 18th of June if I get anything from 'em.  I came "home" and Dale and I went for Mexican. :)  I got the same table I did on Friday afternoon.  It was super yummy!  We came home and each took naps.  Our 18-year-old neighbor, Chad, was obnoxious today and knocked, called, knocked, called, over and over until finally Dale answered the phone.  Dale told him to call back later that he was sleeping.  Around 8 we finally went to Hollywood Video and got Miracle and LOTR 3 (whoopie, not a fan and haven't even seen 2).  We watched the Miracle and it was really good.  It made me miss the Silvertips so much!  I cannot wait for hockey this September!  Well, it's almost May 31, 2004 and I'm supposed to be moved out by tomorrow; that is so not going to happen.  I will stay at Joe and David's tomorrow night probably.  I was supposed to go look at a place this weekend, but Josh occupied me and I didn't get to it.  I will talk to him tomorrow an see if I can stop by on the way to Mom and Grandma's/Joe and David's.  I have two appearances to make tomorrow. ;)  I'm so popular.  I don't know where things are going to go with Josh, but he's a very nice guy, but a bit young at just 18 on April 15.  It's funny the he knows who Garret is and sees him daily.  Garret went there on Tuesday and I started talking with Josh on Thursday, I believe.  Anyway, those following my blog are up to date!  Hope this finds you doing well and enjoying your Memorial Day weekend!  Jason
