Corrections and stuff to help me get caught up.  I had to walk to school and then walk back.  Then walk back for basketball.  When I got back from doing Geometry, I noticed the door was open.  At first I thought maybe someone broke in.  Then I thought the dogs would be making more noise.  So I didn't even think more about it.  So practice was alright.  Not too exciting.  It never is though.  I worked hard, even though we had to do running because some people didn't know what a jump-stop was.  Things like that piss me off because stupid people can screw off and make us all run.  I try not to worry about it though.  Game tomorrow night at home.  I'm looking to get a win.  Night.
