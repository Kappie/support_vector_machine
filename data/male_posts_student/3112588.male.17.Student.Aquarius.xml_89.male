LoL! we ran into Mrs.Bigelow, and she and my mom talked for about 20 minutes. then, we walked around for a little while longer...we almost bought like hecka snacks at the "Primrose Bakery". dude, their cream puffs and cakes looked so great...easy to drop like $200 bucks in that place...but, my mom and i are both disgusted with our 3 lb. weight gain, and decided to resist. we went to walgreens, grabbed something to drink, and looked at a couple of magazines while waiting in line...had to tackle my mom and grab the huge package of candy she had in her hand--the lady behind me started laughing, when i told my mom she was acting like a child! LoL! after we got something to drink, we drove back home, where i forgot to ask suzy something VERY important. earlier this morning, i sent an e-mail to ariel via pablo's email...he emailed me back like 10 minutes later, and said that he was desperately in need of some people to work at camp from August 16th-August 31st. i talked to my dad, and he's really happy that i get to go to camp after all--since he DID ruin it for me in the first place. sooo i called suzy right away, and told her the good news! i couldn't believe it--WE'RE GOING TO KOINONIA YAY!! LoL! she was screaming so loud when i told her...Koinonia is our 2nd home, no doubt. but we're both thankful that only new people are going to be up there. there were some left over issues from last summer (**cough cough...dining room supervisor...cough cough**) LoL! it's OK suzy--you and i will prob be in charge, b/c the "newbies" really don't know what they're doing, pablo tells me....so yeah, we're both leaving August 15th, unless we decide to go NEXT friday, to see Kandace before she leaves. i'm not sure what is going on atm...i might miss the first week of school (only 3 days) to stay up there with suzy so that we can finish up there...we are prob going to work there over Family Camp weekend too, b/c they're always short on summer staff that weekend. so, anywayz...suzy and i weren't invited to something that was going on tonight, and we were both shocked. so, we decided to go and buy a few things to make us happy! LoL! jk...no, but we did go shopping, and i got this hecka tite polo from Hollister just for kicks! The Cowart Family took yet ANOTHER trip to the mall before the school year begins..i think that i've been shopping over 25 times since the summer started, probably even more. we had lots of fun. came back home, ate dessert, watched some TV, then i drove her home! i've been driving the freeway like all day--and i'm SO good at it LoL! it was great fun...and yes, i DO have a "lead foot". tomorrow, i'm just gonna run around town...then thursday, suzy and i are going to Bay Street and shop it up for a few hours....gotta pick up a few more shirts and pants from AF, and i have this GAP certificate where i get like 25% off my entire purchase, so i'm gonna buy like 3 dress shirts from them, and probably another nice jacket. well, gotta run! can't wait until the parents leave...i applied at "Aaron's Cratfters" today at the Village. i think that i got the job--then i heard that Kathryn Holland applied. maybe she and i will get to work together?
