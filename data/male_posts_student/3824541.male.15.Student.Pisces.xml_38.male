No, not just because of the shirtless dudes, but because I  should  be there (Well, I mean I am there, but... you know what I mean).  See the kid behind Andrew? Wait, who am I kidding? You don't know who Andrew is. Well, Andrew is the one that looks like a toothpick. The kid behind him should be me. My best friend is in that picture smiling, right next to my other best friend. Then there's Joe, who's like the coolest guy I never met, but I bet that if I did meet him, I'd think he was just as cool.  I always think of life as a book. I'm being serious for once. Everybody has conflicts just as big as mine, but not everybody can see them. Everybody strives to be something they can't, and that's the challenge of life. It's like, that's what keeps us going... this hope. This hope makes up who we are.  Right now, I wish I could be in Florida. Making-out with Brittney, talking about things that we both don't understand with Becca, Jumping in Katie's pool, talking deep with Bobby, and frolicking with Erin. It makes me so sad when I think of all that I left. I also get kinda angry at myself when I think of what I didn't realize I had. I never realized how good my friends were to me, and how much I really appreciated them. I never realized how much leaning on Bobby's shoulder helped, and how Katie just being there helped me go through life. I don't even know anymore; it's all slipping away, but I don't think that I was that great to my friends in Florida.  In the end though, I believe everything happens for a reason. Mr. Agnostic-no-religion-rebel Daniel believes that everything happens for a reason. I love everyone there: The Ross', The Seifters, Brittney, Becca, Erin, and Bobby. Oh my god. I'm so sad I can't be there.   Work without hope is like nectar in a sieve   I really have no idea how idea how that quote plays into what I'm saying, but bleh. Ok Mr. Silly Daniel, let's stop being serious. *Reads the above* Wow. It sounds like I'm writing a fucking suicide note.  Anyways, I told you I'd do two things on yesterday's list, and I did do two of them:  -Haircut - Ehh, he cut it too short. -Mike's block party - Very awkward. I was kinda stressed, and I didn't really party. I (me) was kinda boring to say the least. The party was cool though. We got to sing Karaoke which rocked!  So... about 34 pages about "The Odyssey" are written in a yellow journal in my room. 18 books down. Oh, BTW, I'm asking everyone who has ever read the Odyssey and reads my blog to leave me a few Homeric Similes and where they're found.  Thanks.  Fucking life. \m/  It's 2:55 AM and this cramp in my wrist puts me back to sleep. (Story of the year - In the Shadows [2:10]).
