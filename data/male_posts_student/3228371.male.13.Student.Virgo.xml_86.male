However, I'll try right now to the best of my ability to write a whole blog entry about him!    Let's go back in time...  It all started in the beginning of the school year. I didn't even know him then. I knew there was a guy named Nima, but I didn't exactly know who he was. I knew Katherine liked him last year but that was it. I got to know him better and better, bit by bit. It all started with... music. I guess like many people, we have a passion for music. Especially guitars. He and I were the only guitar-players in this class. Actually, in the whole grade 8, I think only Mark, Nima, Gordon, and I play guitar. I think. As far as I know, that is. So basically, no guitar players in 8Oberoi. Nima and I were the only ones who played the guitar in 8Rodway, while Gordon and Mark were in 8Sandiford. Anyways... I guess that's what got me to see him there and notice that we had something in common. We talked a lot about creating bands and guitars. Eventually, I looked at him as a pretty good friend that I could talk to. I started having relationship problems with Wilfred and I turned to Nima for help. He was the only close guy friend I had then. I didn't want to talk to my girl friends about it, for some reason, and that's kind of where it began. It was November and my feelings for Wilfred had slowly faded away, little by little. Later, I realized that I had developed feelings for Nima. Of course! Who wouldn't? ;)   I started blogging because of all this stuff in my head, practically causing it to explode. He read my blog and realized what the whole thing was about. He admitted he had small feelings for me but also Sara. Hmm, I think I've forgotten that part. Sara. He liked her a lot and he ended up with a broken heart. I felt really bad for him and when I realized I had feelings for him, I wasn't sure if they were "FEELINGS" or pity. That was what made me confused.  In December, I broke up with Wilfred after volleyball (before I left). His eyes got red, as well as his face. Seemed like he was going to break down and cry. I had to leave and gave him a quick hug and an apology. I felt really bad. Then, we got back together after a few weeks. Do you know why? Because I made the stupid mistake of mstakening the pity I felt for Wilfred for FEELINGS. See what a goofball I am?   Eventually, I realized my mistake (a lot of realization in this story) and broke up with Wilfred on February 12, 2004. I sent him an email and he got it. That was the third and last time I broke up with Wilfred. For good. He was really heartbroken. Sent me an email to ask for another chance. I said "Sorry no" and that was it. It hurt a lot to watch the guy I had fallen for go around after Sara, Shar, and Katie. But you know what? Fuck it... it was worth it. :) He clearified the whole Shar thing to me later and he asked Katie to the Valentine's Dance. It was cute. I tried my best and did all I could as a good friend to just be happy for him and stuff.   On February 14, 2004... I was on MSN talking to Jordan and Nima. Nima had to go and went offline. Therefore, I was left with only Jordan to talk to. Jordan had to go to and went offline as well. I figured they went to some arcade or the mall together or wherever so I just talked to some other people on MSN. A few minutes after that, the doorbell rang. It startled me and I went downstairs to see who it was. Nima and Jordan. I was thinking: "What are these two doing here? Damn! I'm still in my PJs! Argh!" and opened the door for them. My mom, dad, and sister were out somewhere for the whole day so I let them in. Only my grandpa was upstairs and he was listening to his radio so whatever. Jordan did his thing and just made himself comfortable in my place. Nima was polite and stuff and we just... talked. Offered Jordan some sourkeys and Nima messed around with ChooChoo. (ChooChoo = my chinchilla) I knew they couldn't stay that long 'cos my parents would be back soon so I asked why they were here and told them that my parents would be back soon so they might have to leave. Nima said that the real reason they came was to give me something and he handed me a box. Inside was a bracelet. I didn't really see anything on it since I just glanced at it... I didn't know how to react and so I gave Nima a hug and thanked him. They left and we embraced once again at the door. [UenTung unni saw us hug at the door since she was on her computer in her room, which faced the door to my house] Later, I was on the computer after they left and I examined the bracelet more closely. Tears came to my eyes when I saw what was on the bracelet. "I LOVE U".   After a few weeks, I heard that Katie told Nima that she liked him. At first, I thought that the two of them would probably end up together or Katie would do what she did to Derry. I was just worried for Nima because I didn't want him to get hurt. However, that didn't happen.  On March 3, 2004 after school, Nima asked me out. His friends were trying to make him do it. I had to go so I jumped into the car and left. After that, he called me and asked me on the phone. Of course, I said: "Sure" and that was how it happened.  He left to Iran on March 5, 2004 and he was gone for 3 weeks. Throughout those 3 weeks, I missed him terribly. Of course, he came back and now it's been 2 months since we've been together.    Nima...  Like I said, he's a great guy. He's sweet, cute, smart, funny, understanding, fun to be with, outgoing, and just... perfect! One of a kind. I love him. He's the best guitarist in the world, my favourite rocker, my alien, and my cereal-lover. Haha~ Nima, if you're reading this, thank you so much for putting up with me. I love everything about him and I'm serious when I say he's perfect. Now, Candace might say that ROGER is perfect but you know what? That's cool too. Nima is perfect in my eyes and nobody could ever replace him. I loved him then, I love him still. I love him now, and always will. I couldn't possibly ask for more in a guy. He's perfect. Nima, I love you and don't YOU ever forget that either.   Conclusion  Well, this concludes my blog entry about Nima and our history. Wasn't it fun reading me go on and on about him? Haha! Anyways, gonna go have my Sheperd's Pie now! God bless y'all!
