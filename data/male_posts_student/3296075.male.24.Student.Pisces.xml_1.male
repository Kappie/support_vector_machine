We spent two days down on the boat this past weekend.  We worked through an extensive list of repairs and took her out on our maiden voyage.  She moved with great agility and power and now it is up to us to match her in these traits.  To correct the previous post, we don't have a Hunter 34, we have a  urlLink 1980 Hunter 33 .  And now for a couple pics from the past weekend.  The  urlLink Blue Sky . A  urlLink Manatee  hangin out by the boat.
