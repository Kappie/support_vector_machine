Other than that all my classes are naptime. Ben bought the covert sniper and I think he's crazy for getting it but whatever, as long as we don't loose AEGs I'm fine with it. I managed to save his MP5 by buying it off him for $90 which is a sweet deal. Yeah so after I got the financial dealings reguarding Ben's MP5 squared away Kara came over and we hung out for an hour then she had to go to Gilroy or something to go shopping so I decided to do a little fix up work on Ben's MP5. I decided to clean the barrel by pushing a wad of tissue down the barrel then shooting it out. Well I screwed up and ended up spending the next 2 hours trying to get this tissue out of the barrel when I got a call from Kara. Aparently her friends bailed on the shopping idea so she came back out and we hung out until midnight, dang I wanted to get some friggin sleep, oh well, it was fun and worth the lack of sleep. And here I am at amost 1 AM still writing about it. I need sleep. Later
