This was the very First time I finished checking and waited for the rest to complete theirs. Feels damn great man! Most of all I didn't have to check the second floor, it feels so good standing up right on the flat solid floor to work. I haven done this much walking in weeks, seriously, I won't go walk in and out  around my house right?  So, we're suppose to be at Ubi at 1:30pm, but we turn up early and so CoFFee BrEaK!! Turns out somebody given us a cushion timing , right? Turn up at the work place at 1:50+, and we were the first group to be there. So there was the briefing and it was off to work. The way Desmond and I worked was kinda interesting, we can just switch our post anytime. High shelf where he couldn't reach, low shelf and tight spot I couldn't go, we would switch our post. So half the time I was a counter and the other half a recorder. Pick up a little trick of the trade form him, still I'm loss at some points.  WORK WORK WORK!!  5pm DINNER TIME!!!   Wahliao I just came out of the toilet after washing my hands, and caught looking retard while calling Amos to meet up. AARrgghhh... Forget it, hao nan bu gen nu do√º, i can't win anyway (nice shirt [the jersey that you were talking about?] with your nick written on it). Even having dinner with the boys was such a mess. Next time, someone has got to take down the cash transaction down, dividing the change was such a hassle. Ok, dinner's done! BAck to work.. Desmond and I did another 3 more sets, and we're done. That's not the case for Amos  Kah Loong, seems like pairing them up was a big mistake. Amos was new and Kah Loong only had working experience of just once before (me too). So they end up with bad communication and thus that slows them down. 3 sets for the whole of today, if I remember correctly. As I took a walk home cutting through the market, notice I haven been down for too long and some of the stalls has already stop opening due to the up coming upgrading. Ok, Gotta go shower now. Nitex everyone~!
