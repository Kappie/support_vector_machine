I know you've been allocated a friendship that has required you to now be signed up for things you never signed on for originally.  I am, however, realizing that friendships are just that.  If a friend isn't going to be there for me through the ups and downs of the cards we're all dealt in life, I don't want any part of said friendship.  Likewise, with your cards.. I'll always be there to help u with that hand of life's poker.  "There's nothing I could say to make you try to feel okay, and nothing you could do to stop me feeling the way I do.  And if the chance should happen that I never see you again, just remember that I'll always love you.  I'd be a better person on the other side, I'm sure.  You'd find a way to help yourself and find another door, to shrug off minor incidents, make us both feel proud, I just wish I could be there to see you through. "  "You always were the one to make a stand out in a crowd, though every once upon a while your head was in a cloud.  There's nothing you could ever do to make me feel let down, and remember that I'll always love you."  The good news is, I plan on being there to see you through.  Thank you for understanding stuff, thank you for being patient, thank you for not thinking differently of me through my faults, truths, and short comings.  Thank you for knowing that I trust you, and thank you for being trustworthy.  You are a blessing to my life.  Never forget it.  Never lose sight of the fact that I would not let you see the hand of cards I was dealt and want so much to be a part of your poker game as well, if I did not love you dearly.
