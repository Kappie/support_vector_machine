I'm just glad a decision was made. We are still gonna talk every once in awhile and stay friendly. Ironically, it was ended yesterday which was the 26th, what would have been our 7th month. Kinda funny because in my previous relationship it ended on the one month...scary...gotta look out for those month anniversaries from now on...  Evan is driving back from Wisconsin as we speak, so we will be practicing tomorrow or thursday. Then possibly off to his cousins studio within the next two weeks.   Filming is going incredibly slow for BCP, we got one scene done, and we had to cancel today due to the rain. Bummer.   Went to Livonia Drugs and put in an application, my dad says they are hiring two stock boys. Gonna keep my fingers crossed...   bye bye
