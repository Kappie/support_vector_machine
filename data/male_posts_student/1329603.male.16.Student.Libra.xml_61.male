Showstoppers is doing an American-type theme for their next show. Squeh, God knows what we'll be doing. Well, we'll be doing Razzle Dazzle and America, and some other things.  The approaching money-earning gig is... well... approaching. I'll be getting between £50 and £60 for it. But who really cares? O_O'  Have you ever noticed the lack of respect you get for being a completely commited musician?  Love, Jon Roskilly
