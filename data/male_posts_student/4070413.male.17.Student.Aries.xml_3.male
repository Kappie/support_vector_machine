Stand guard against everypassby chances. Regardless good or bad and assume everything is here to destroy n hurt you. Driven to madness by love. When will i grow up? How long must i remain as a kid? the rising sun is forcing me to move on. Where did i come from? Where should i proceed to? Where is safe for me? Insecurity is how i feel. Everybody had put on a poker face. What is real; what is fake? I don't know. I can only stay calm and analyse every single person. Not to let my guards down. Judges are unbelievable. DO humans know that people around are putting on a facad? Or have they realise and refuse to believe that they are? Or are they simple n pure? Are their sympathy real or are they there to mislead you n get you hurt again? Complex - a set of prepressed emotions and ideas which affext a person's behaviour; an exaggerated reaction(to something). I had enough of thepeople who hides their true evil self. Show yourself! Stop it! I had seen lots of fabrications. Convinced that that humans learn to protect themselves. Kind hearted is not my personality. Hatred in me cause me to lose myself again. Learned that standing in the crowd will only endangered myself but i chose to hide inside. The philosophies of human nature is profound. Ridiculous contradictions only put yourself into more confuse mindset.
