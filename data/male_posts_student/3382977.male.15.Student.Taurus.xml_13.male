The Religion Exam, on the other hand, was the longest thing i have ever done...ok, i was going along with the first page of pretty much simple straight forward multiple choice questions...and im thinking this is a breeze and that im gonna get this done in 20 minutes max...but them i turn the page and POW...there are like 20 vocab words from Islam, Judaism and Christianity ( most i knew well ) and about 15 short answers ( which the teacher usually likes a couple sentences for each )...and on top of that we were supposed to write an essay on comparing two of the three religions...so there was a crap load to be done in an hour and a half.    estimated grades for todays finals ... Bio=85% min. and Religion=90% min.    wasnt too bad....but now i gotta study for my english and geometry coming up tomorrow...
