I started to complain about that but then thought about how that would be me whining about whiners and that doesn't sound good!  People have a right to do certain things.  If the things they are doing are not morally wrong, why complain?  It's annoying to complain for the complainer and those around him/her.  But a lot of people complain about a political figure who complains about things and does nothing about them.  Yet the people who complain about political figures often don't vote or else they ONLY vote and don't support the political canidate that they are rooting for.  And yet I'm complaining about them when I can't vote and am not actively involved in politics!  Now listen to me!  I'm complaining about myself complaining about complainers who complain about complainers!  My head hurts now!
