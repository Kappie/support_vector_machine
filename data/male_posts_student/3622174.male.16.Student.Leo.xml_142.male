School  Things seem to be going quite better at school now.  Spanish didn't bore me to death (at all, actually), I spent half of the front office period outside, for both a fire drill and to change the sign out front.  Yearbook was better because we're starting pre-planning for this year.  I can't wait to get started on my section; me and Lauren have good ideas.  And then Economics was cool today because Mr. Economics Teacher basically sat there, talked about Economics, poking jokes at Clayton and Joe the whole time, which was pretty cool.  So, my day was better, for the most part.  There are a couple girls on yearbook staff right now who I am not very happy with, mainly because they can't keep their mouths shut about stuff that isn't true, and they're sitting there and telling everyone.  If it were up to me, I'd make sure they got the hard yearbook assignments, but, that's not the kind of person I am, and I'm not going to do it that way.  But, they need to learn to keep their mouths shut-- I did, and they should have to too, otherwise, they are going to form a bad reputation on yearbook staff.   Hey, look, a Hurricane!  Yeah, supposedly there's like two hurricanes heading towards The River.  One of which could be here by Friday (the 13th, unfortunately), and one a couple days after that.  Why us?  Is it some kind of Friday the 13th bad luck symbol?  Hopefully we'll have good luck and it will suddenly go north, therefore not even bringing rain of any kind to The River.   One advantage of the whole hurricane thing is that they will cancel school, but, of course, my dad obsesses greatly over these things, so it would therefore become a disadvantage.   I'm Running Out of Ideas.  Yes, folks, the great Bagel has fallen.  I am running out of ideas, and I don't want to.  So, I may take a couple days off from Blogging in the next week or so, and start thinking of some new original ideas.  So, if I stop posting for a couple days, that's because I am working on new ideas.  Note to self: Birthday is still next Friday.  Don't forget it. Another Note to Self: That day is the 20th.  And, with that said, I'm out for now.  Maybe later, I'll post about what I'm reading in The Lord of the Rings, or maybe post a picture of what I've been doing in Photoshop lately, because it truly is an awesome program.  So, see ya for now.
