We're going camping, but top-end, luxury camping with all sorts of facilities and electrical stuff included, i.e. not like crappy British camping which I haven't had the 'pleasure' of experiencing yet. Anyway, I'm taking my camera with me and since France is just so beautiful, I should come back with tons of photos. Because I have a portable hard drive, I can take over 200 top quality photos per day if I so wish, plus videos on top of that. Most of all, I'm looking forward to relaxing and not having to worry about things.  Back to Thursday - it was the day that the new version of Thunderbolt launched and I got up early and ploughed through the remaining work. It went live just after lunch and the feedback has been very positive. I'm extremely pleased with the new site and Thunderbolt as it now stands and it makes me a very proud guy.  Friday was spent working on the site, adding new content and looking for the few bugs that were hiding amongst the site. I made a little tutorial for editors and then made some mockups of the content management system so that it can be made while I'm away.  Yesterday I went to work, where it was incredibly hot to an unbearable extent. I got home and was shattered, but had to get changed and go off to a BBQ at my parents' friend's house. I arrived their in good time and the actual house was impressive to say the least. I knew that the guy had made quite a bit of money in property and had just turned 60, but this house was properly badass, ha. It must have been worth Â£2 million, easily. No-one was allowed inside, but instead we were out in the massive garden (with adjacent lake and meadow), with the three car garage as the buffet area. At the end of the party, about half of the guests slept in the garden in about 11 tents, including us. this morning we stayed there for a few hours then came back home.  On a side note, I got to try out my dad's friend's Apple Powerbook G4, which basically convinced me to switched to Mac as soon as I can, i.e. when I come back from my gap year. Let's get the holidays and the rest of school out hte way though first, eh?  Check back in a few week's time for more updates.
