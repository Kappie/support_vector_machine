Seeing as I'm not a big movie-theater kinda guy, I suggest all 3 people who still havent seen it to check it out.   That being said....  I'm trying to find ways to lift my mood up. This morning I woke up in a shitty mood, feeling angry and frustrated at what, well, at the time, was nothing. You know. One of those days. Then the whole stupid friendship lying/gloating thing from who may or may not still be my friend annoyed the piss outta me more, and it just seemed as though what looked to be a day of relaxing at home in front of the computer would be a day of misdirected anger and pent up feelings. He obviously got pissed at me, to which current extent I've lost my interest in, as everyone has a right to "One of those days". Sure that isnt much of an excuse, as it isnt supposed to be. If Mike wants to stay mad at me he can, if not, he doesnt have to. Fuck getting angry now. It's not even worth getting pissed over something like this or anything anymore, because...well...it just isn't.   I'm not going to apologize though, because I'm only going over what I'm thinking. If someone wants to get pissed about my views, then they don't have to listen to me. I don't make anyone do anything. I also don't expect, nor want, an apology for anything, by anyone, for any reason. Not really, anymore. Whatever happens happens from now on.  I have a feeling I'll forget I said that..  Well now, to ease my thoughts and calm my frazzled nerves, I got Rush playing, with the tv off and the fan on hi....trying to just calm myself down. Something got me unnecessarily riled up, and I wanna reverse it. Sure, the legit reasons I'm mad about are still there, but since I'm trying not to sweat the issues, well... Yeah. I could use a light drink and an island palace.  And a nap.
