I'm only typing them in here because felt that I needed to at least acknowledge the confusion.  Today (er... yesterday) I had lunch with Christina, who I haven't seen or talked to in SO ridiculously long.  We had a great conversation, and I played her the new Hyannis stuff along with Roo's new demo.  Thanks, Christina, for feeling like you could talk to me about everything.  I'm always here. :)  I'm heading up to NH so that I can go with my family to my cousin Eleni's graduation.  My aunt is the commencement speaker... quite a controversial figure she's been of late.  I hope the crowd treats her well.  They probably will... Maine likes her a lot.  I'm relieved that she and I don't talk politics when we get together, though, even though something inside me is always dying to ask her a question about something political when I see her.  I love and respect her, and love that she's doing what she believes is right.  I just don't believe it's right... it's a tough thing.  But I do so admire her, and that's the important thing.  More later.
