I've loved Spider-Man for as long as I can recall, and typically mistake myself for him, though thankfully this has never occurred near the edge of any tall buildings. I supported and enjoyed the first film, even with the slight creative changes that they made to his costume, powers, and villains. But damn, let me tell you, Spider-Man 2 hit the bullseye in ways I never dreamed possible.   In one film, the writers managed to incorporate plot elements that took decades to establish in comics. The action is a whirlwind of intensity, the special effects some of the most seamless and realistic I've ever seen. All of the acting has improved from the first, and the humor is dead on and frequent. I even thought Kirsten Dunst finally became Mary Jane near the end of the film (not to knock her ability, but I just didn't initially agree with her casting or the writing of her role).  This movie does to the first Spidey film what X2 did to X-Men...it blew it out of the water. It's not that the first film was bad by any stretch of the word, but this movie is Spider-Man done with a freedom that allows for true homage to the character. This film felt as though it was truly a comic book story, full of love, adventure, suspense, and tragedy, and someone decided to rip it out of its pages and paste it up on the big screen.  So now that I've given you my completely spoiler-free review of Spider-Man 2, regardless of whether or not you even care about the good 'ole Web Head, I should probably just shut up and let you go see it...if you so choose. Until next time, this is your friendly neighborhood Spi....(cough)...Dave, signing off and passing out.
