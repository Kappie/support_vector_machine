Maybe it's not a big deal, but he knows it's one of my pet peeves when someone says they will do something and then doesn't.  If he had even messages and said he was busy with something and would call later it wouldn't even be a consideration at all ... but now an hour and a half late and nothing ... ugh.  why do i worry about such rediculous things?  i cant even remember what i put in here on my last entry (even tho it was only a few hours ago [sad huh?]).  i dont remember if i mentioned my latest toy (i think i did briefly).  well i discovered today that I ran out of hard drive space for lunix (nice of it to tell me).  so now i am cleaning off some space and going to resize my partitions so as to create more space for linux ... fun fun.  then maybe i can get it working like i want.  i still have to recofigure the network every time i reboot.  i really dont like linux .. but i am learning a lot and keeping myself busy at work so its all good.  i went to see the family today.  not really because i wanted to but because they had a computer problem that they cant fix (and it seem its a doozie of a problem).  so i was over at mom's and she made dinner .. now this is a rare privaledge and treat for me these days.  chicken pot pie .... i LOVE chicken pot pie ... and my mom makes the BEST chicken pot pie ever ... and i gorged myself (is that how you spell that?!? oh well).  then i had forgot it's wednesday ... my family goes to church on Wed (and twice on Sun [we have every since b4 i was born]).  SOOOO since i was there .. and mom knew i wasn't working or particularly busy ... i had to go :-\   I don't like going there anymore.  i was sitting there listening to the sermon and realized YET AGAIN that i haven't missed a single thing in all the time i have been away.  its the same old tired stuff resaid in a slightly different way.  i ALMOST got up at the end and said something to that effect, but i am chicken and couldn't do it.  ok so now i am home ... yay ... and sooo freakin tired .... i should go to bed, but i need to finish copying data ... the ? will be if i can resist working more on linux once the copy is done ... we shal see
