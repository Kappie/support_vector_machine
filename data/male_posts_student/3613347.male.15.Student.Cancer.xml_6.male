Almost 3/4 of it is blank, the reason is because i dunno how to do... Hopefully when my cousins come over, they can help out! ;)   Started on English today, decided to leave all the summaries for later and do the compre qns only, but i was just too lazy to complete all the qns. Left 1 worksheet i haven started on it yet. Its just beside me now... i think i'll do it tonight or tomorrow then.   Maths will be left for school reopen when i shall CO-OPERATE with my dear friends and do it together. Its an online quiz which ends on 30 June, thus we have time to do it together in the library.  Chinese will be done soon too, anything i dunno i'm sure Shu Xia can help me out. I still remember u got DISTINCTION for Chinese right? Chicken Wing was so like "'wah kao' u lie to me, say u sure fail one... then in the end get Distinction". LOL So humble ar some pppl.   Well thats all in the past, and the future awaits. Will be older and hopefully more mature next week, when my birthday arrives. Yong Sheng supposed to accompany me go Liverpool FC Fan Club to buy jerseys and football, but not confirmed, maybe any of u out there also can help me do this favour and bring me there. I've been wanting to go for 4 years.   Thx, and eternal gratitude... Love ya
