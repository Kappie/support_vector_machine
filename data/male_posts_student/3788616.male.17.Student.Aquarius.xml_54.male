Anyway, i guess, most of it was regarding studies while the rest were related to my personal life lah... as usual, blah blah blah...  Anyway, i had Geog lecture today, and during the whole thing, i realised how much i had missed, how much i needed to study, certainly, there were lots of people out there that were putting so much more effort than i was! I had better buck up if i were to do well! Yup, so i am really determind to do better and so... STUDY HARDER!!! Really must keep telling myself that sia!  Heex... another thing, i am sick and tired of the politics that is happening in the CO already! Man, Lance damn it! Grow up! We all know what is going on, so don't bloody hell walk around and flaunt your damn knowledge lah! It's like, he is so full of himself at times and always acts with false modesty! it is so irritating! Wah lau, even with regards to his results, pretend he forget than slowly pretend pretend and tell you he got B, A, A, A! Yup! Definitely good results but come on lah! Don't have to 'kae si' until like that right? And that's it lah, i am washing my hands of what position i am going to take at the CO already, President, Vice-President, Secretary, anything lower? i don't want to care anymore! Crap! Just let them do my job and see how it goes lah! I don't care anymore, i'll just do my best in whatever position i get lah... oh well... my love is towards the CCA and not the damn people around me! Nor the position!  Ok, anyway, Kelly... yup... it was the thing that was kind of bugging me the whole period here... i was dispirited, sad and depressed... Certainly, i won't deny that 1 of the reason was because of this ongoing confusion as to what is it that we really have between us... but no more, i will not really want to bother so much anymore? yup, it's a question, cause, to be honest, i am not really sure this is what i really think in the end... so yeah... i am just so tired, so unsure, so confused... simply so vulnerable... not knowing what to do, whether to go on, just so... damn... drained... with an excrutiating pain of dispair overwhelming me... not, it's not Kelly's fault... it's simply my own hopelessness that's driving me to a corner... oh well, all i can say is that for now, i will simply be here for her, waiting silently and passively for her... cause, i don't want to get myself burnt to badly anymore... heex... To Kelly, what can i say, i guess in the end, i failed you... committment is a thing that i am prepared to do, but, right now, it's simply up to you... will wait for you, certainly will wait, till the day you tell me it's all over, that there's no hope... till then, i will always be here for you, a friend... or... anything and anyway you want me to be... Just take good care of yourself and keep smiling! the letter, just somethings that i wanted you to know, just in case, i lose faith in everything... yup... Be HAPPY! :p  Here's another part of my life... Jill, thanks for being a dear friend to me, forever hearing my problems and lending a listening ear... what can i say? Perhaps it's precisely these qualities that made me have a crush on you in the past, but alas, it's all gone... now, i just have a few things on my mind... Particularly studies, CCA and of course, my own, LOVE LIFE?  haha... To Cherie, let all that we shared be a little secret of ours yeah! Don't make me so super embarassed by telling everyone hor! heex... thanks for making feel so happy whenever i am with you, whether by going out as a group, messaging or by the phone calls... thanks for being a great person and certainly, someone special in my life! To the end of this all, once everything has been settled, you shall know everything that i actually want to tell you yeah! Keep smiling! And don't you dare die on me, remember our agreemement!  Take care all my friends! If you have any worries or problems, cast them all unto the LORD and know that HE is always there! Keep smiling! *CHEERS* :P
