Anyway Ive been listening to some CD that are on the school network and I just finished listening to the William Hong CD. Ok I think the guy is great but give me a brake. This is fun for the first 2 or 3 songs but then you just get a headache, he really cant finish off more than 1/2 a song so the first part of his songs are always so much better than the second.  Anyway here in Iceland we've got  urlLink Leoncie !!! Shes this Indian who believes shes the best thing since well... EVER. Shes always in some fight with somebody around here calling them racist and something like that.  Now shes leaving the country for a huge record deal (Yeah right).  Back to finance.
