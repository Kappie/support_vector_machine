Well, it's Storm from X-Men. HaHa! I am watching that movie right now. What a cool Storm! Meow moo meow!!  HaHa. The movie's just finished and Iam now eating Super's Tom Yam Cup Noodle. Good stuff, that noodle! Weee!   Okay. Today's bascially boring. Yeah. I mainly played Pokemon in the morning. Oh, did you know? I downloaded the Pokemon Sapphire ROM and played it. HaHa. I am so hooked after watching the Pokemon cartoon. Now I got a Treecko and a Taillow, and many other Pokemon too. I am a collector. HaHa.   Okie. In the afternoon, I didn't do my homework. I don't know how to do, not that I don't want to do leh! I didn't attend the lectures, and I got very confused. Sigh. At least I have some form of valid excuse. Hem hem.  Right. I did minutes instead. Ayioh. It's very difficult to cook up minutes. You have to literally put words in people's mouths. HaHa. This project really teaches creativity after all. Wahaha!  Okay. After that I played more Pokemon, earned more levels and finally went to buy dinner.   After dinner was bathing, and X-Men watching. Tada! Here I am, writing this blog. Even ducks could meow at that. Right.   I think I gotta go le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
