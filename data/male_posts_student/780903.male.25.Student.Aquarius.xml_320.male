Play  urlLink The Ranking Game , a slightly outdated application on the University of Indiana web page that lets you rank law schools based about two dozen categories that you can assign weights to.  Find fun measures -- like # library seats / student -- that put Drake University at #1 and Harvard at #164.  Or school sq. feet / student, where Thomas Cooley is #1 and Yale is #155.  Fun stuff.
