Not yet 5, he can hold seven-pound weights with arms extended, something many adults cannot do. He has muscles twice the size of other kids his age and half their body fat."  What I wouldn't give to get my hands on whatever you use to turn off that protein. This little boy - born to a 24 year old "muscular" sprinter - from a family of muscular people... Could it be evil Nazi experiments trickling down after 50 years? Or Mutation(tm) finally popping up in reality and not just comic books?  I'm in. Hook me up. And find me a phone booth.
