I wole up this morning w/ my entire body acheing and a fever of 101. So I called the Doc and went in to see what was wrong. He said I had Viral Gastrotentitis. (something like that) I @ home now moaping around w/ nothing to do. I cant start my new job tomorrow night and I dont know if I'll be going back to school on Wed. Oh well.     Everett: (This is just for you) Everett and I are going to be hanging out soon and I cant wait. He is so freakin hot. I dont know what we'll do but I'm sure it'll be loads of fun. lol
