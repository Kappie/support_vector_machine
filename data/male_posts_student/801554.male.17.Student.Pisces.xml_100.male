       
      Just got back from decorating my church for Christmas, a Christmas party, and a family Christmas get-together. All on the same day. Now I'm listening to a Christmas music radio station while I type this.   Got some gifts a bit early...some Hitchhiker trading cards from my very cool aunt, the new version of Let It Be, the PC game of Return of the King, and a very very nice chess set.  Tomorrow I have to brave the crowds to do some last minute shopping. Wish me luck, I suppose...
