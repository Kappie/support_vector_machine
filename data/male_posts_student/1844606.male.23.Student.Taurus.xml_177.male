I dislike neo-hippies.  I had great sight lines for the show because the geriatric crowds back's are compressing due to old age.  Bob Dylan thinks he's a cowboy, and no longer plays guitar.  I recognized only 4 songs, and that took some work.  I fell in love for a few moments hoping of possibilities.  I danced but did not sing and moved my hips.  Riding back on empty train, long lonely drive down dark encrusted Green Bay Rd.  Too many hours in a crampt Honda, wishing for better things.  And friends.  Went through withdrawl of caffine.  Got my fix and did a paper, ran into a girl I hadn't seen in a while and snagged free pizza and listened to the crystalized vinyl voice of mr. bobby dylan.    you got nothing to lose.
