M.Tech project is a big thing ---- solid 20 credits which have the capacity to really shake your GPA ( for the uninitiated, small number x : x lies between 0 and 10 ). Things hadn't been looking good for the past few days and I was facing an endless sea of ennui. Besides, there was this tension of not knowing whether you had a project guide after all. This Sunday brought some peace of mind. Although in IIT we do not treat Sundays with that much reverence.... because Monday looms like a storm on the horizon and the day goes by in frantic attempts to escape inquisition at the hands of incorrigibly sadistic ESB profs. What about Saturday Night? Nothing like that Whigfield number. Wathched AIR FORCE ONE after a long time. Difference : This time in The OAT. The prez. smashing the crooks out of his plane and all the rest of the now so common Mega Sale of American Patriotism . What else... nothing much... IIT is pretty boring, if you get what I mean.
