Well, i played soccer agin yesterday it was happy times. I did pretty well actually, i didn't loose nearly as much as i thought i would.i started slow, took acouple easy shots and chipped some balls but progresed and got back into ripping shots. not as fast as i used to get them but hey, its the first time i've played in 6 weeks so im proud of myself. I also played alittle goal and while im out of condition and form, my reactions haven't dulled and i was able to save a few. i still have to train like mad because although i wasn't as bad as i thought i would be, i still need alot of work. After a wearing day of soccer, i went to punkinhead's aka brians house. it was good times aswell except i drank too much mountain dew and ate too much chocolate and we ended up staying up until 5 in the morning. kindof late yes but we slep till 2 this afternoon so needless to say we made up for it. It rained all day today so me and bri listened to blind melon and watched newly weds. sorta a dumb show but its ok. We then went to soccer premeire and looked at cleats. I tried some ouma kings on and realized I WANT THEM. trying them on made me see myself in those cleats even more. i want them SO bad its crazy. Tomorow me and bri have more soccer planed...well watching it anyway, U.S vs Granada world cup qualifying. cool doritos huh? Well, thats it for tonight, good night night. love always -alex
