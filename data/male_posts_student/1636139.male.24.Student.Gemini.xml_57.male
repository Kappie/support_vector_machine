We drove to a clothing store somewhere in Sunnyvale so he could pick up a jacket but got lost upon leaving the store and ended up driving around aimlessly in some very hilly areas with lots of sharp cuurves in the roads. Eventually we found our way to downtown Palo Alto and decided to have dinner at the same place I'd had lunch at yesterday. 
  
Interestingly enough, there was a belly-dancer competition going on there when we arrived! Unfortunately, we got a table with nary a view of the whirling forms. The music was pretty decent though. After dinner we went to Fry's so I could pick up this dirt cheap 802.11g wireless router that had been advertised in yesterday's paper. However, it turned out to be an error on the part of the newspaper and I had to spend a little more than I had been expecting, although the router is still pretty cheap for what it offers. 
  
I've configured it and it works, although it turns out I can get a better signal from somebody else's open WLAN in my bedroom!
