I know I'm technically one of them. Just look at how I live, what I eat, and where I come from... but at least I realize that things such as clothes, cars, and capitalism aren't necessarily good things in our society. Nor do I believe in the general idea of a meritocractic society.  I'll never understand paying more than $25 for a shirt, buying fast cars when there are speed limits, eating out in fancy restaurants, and buy lots of  things . I'm not an ascetic monk-type person, but I simply don't get how people let the materialism and consumerism of our society affect them. I mean people buy all sorts of worthless junk, and then bitch about not having money. People eat expensive and unhealthy foods, then bitch about being fat. People buy gas guzzling cars and then bitch about gas prices. Where's the logic?  In all this they think pure capitalism is a good thing. They think that in a capitalist system, that working hard will get them to the level of Bill Gates? Nevermind the fact that the crappier jobs require harder work for less pay! Then these people criticize the poor for not being as successful as them. Nevermind the fact that you would have had to work many times harder if your parents didn't cover so many of your expenses.  I dunno... I just feel like some people are ignorant sometimes.  ***
