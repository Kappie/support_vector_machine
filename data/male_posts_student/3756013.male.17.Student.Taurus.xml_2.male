This is where my thoughts will go about what happened during the course of my day. I have a feeling I may piss some people off as the weeks go by but o well, I don't care.  Well today, or sense its rather late it would be yesterday, I didn't end up going to sleep until around 8 or 9 in the mourning. I just couldn't sleep. I tried going to sleep around 1 and for some reason I just kept tossing and turning. Well after I finally got to sleep the phone rang and woke me up...and once again...I couldn't go back to sleep...So I got my ass out of bed and cooked me some food. Around 6 my parents and I picked up Juan and we all went to Specs liquor...Very cool store, went to best buy and then to Wings and More. At WAM we watched the Astro's game. That's another thing...WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE ASTROS?!?! We need better pitching. I have been an Astros fan all my life and I will always be an Astros fan...but geeze guys...Get out of your slump and start winning some games! O -well. When I got home from taking Juan home I saw this thing about that new Movie Fahrenheit 9/11. Now that shit really pisses me off. All these damn liberal media people never give Bush any credit. All I ever hear when I turn on the news is Bush bashing! That damn movie makes the creator of the film look stupid because all the stuff he uses in there is all spliced together to make him look bad! IT MAKES NO SENSE! I hate the fucking Demanazies...O-well...Back to sports...t.u is in the college World Series...I hate the fact that they made it that far. Many people think I should go for them just because they are from Texas...but no...I hope the lose, even though they will probably win. I will give them some credit and say they do have a good team. O well, A did pretty good this year with their baseball team, but they ended up losing to LSU in the Super Regionals...o well, good year for them. Well, now that I have bored all of yall with my rambling, I think I will go now. Talk to yall later!
