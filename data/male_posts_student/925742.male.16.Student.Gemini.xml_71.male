Hmmm I feel like getting philisophical and blasphemous.  All to the  CURRENT MUSIC: MORTAL FUCKING KOMBAT MOVIE THEME.  Ok, meme: an idea (which covers grounds of religion and philosophy) that takes hold of a society/civilization like a plague.  Much like a gene, a meme reproduces itself (figurativley, you fucking dolt) and its plausibility and gusto catches many thousands/millions of people.  The idea can be as simple as Us (where "Us" is a naturally defined clan) versus Them ("Them" being another group of organisms that share different genes from "Us").  Ah, good ol' Us Versus Them.  Even in the smallest parts of the genetic world, that is played out.  Ever seen an ameoba eat another, smaller one?  Well, there you go.  Ever seen entire colonies of bacteria "go at it" in effort to take control of a dish full of ager?  I have a picture of that happening (http://www.gongoozler.com/cgi-bin/webcam.cgi, I'm Wes).  Ant colonies, ape families, and especially humans all fight because of such a simple meme.  Us versus Them.  And we have to protect our own, right?  So lets fight!  Its a perfectly natural thing.  More advanced is religion. Oh, *BOY* how I love this meme.  Religion in its simplest form uses what we fear most to make us do things that benefit it.  Death.  We all fear it.  Religion plays upon that fear by boasting it has an invisible power to give us power over such uncertainty.  Oh man, where do I sign up?!  The catch: die for us, give us your land and money, and steal/conquer that other guy's land/riches.  And don't forget to convert him!  And religion just sugar coats this message with words like "love, peace, equality, sharing, forgiveness...." WELL OF COURSE YOU'LL HAVE THESE FUCKING THINGS!!!  But ONLY when said religion/meme takes control of the world.  And, boy howdy, does that take a LOT of death.  And converts.  And money.  Which is what religion is.  Just a devious little idea that plays upon invisible fears like demons and hell with invisible rewards like heaven.  The only people getting rewarded are those that fervously follow the religion like blind fools.    Islamic extremists, anyone?  They even SAID they world conquer the world.  Such a rule by such a meme might bring a form of peace.  But after a few years, it would fall to corruption due to internal factors and faction breakoffs (barbarians.  Always there are barbarians and renegades).  Because of Us Vs. Them and Religion, world peace is not possible.  There can only be a finite ammout of "peace".  There will always be war and fighting.  The only way to have "peace" is to inform stupid religion followers that they are ignorant and open their eyes, cast down their arms, and chill.  But that would require a meme.  A meme of knowlege.  A meme of truth.    And too many people are scared of that.  So such a meme would just fail.  I DARE you to go up to a cultist or Shiite Muslim and tell him he's a fool.  No, sir, I wouldn't.  And politics like Democracy and Communsim?  Meme.  Both easily corruptable due to human nature.  But being humans, we tend to overlook such things and hope that there won't be any corruption or revolts.  And because of ignorance, those things fail.  Its lucky that some laws are just so logical to the modern man that we aren't in a state of constant anarchy.  Laws are actually good memes, that have evolved to benefit the modern man.  Now we don't have unnecessary bloodshed without penalties.  Or thieving.  But there are always renegades to fuck things up.  I mean, if we can do anything we can to keep memes from colliding or falling apart, things would be fine.  But Bush has to insist on war, and that gangster robbing your car just HAS to keep his life in control by disobeying the law.    I love how memes work... just like living organisms.    END RANT.  Tomorrow: The illusion of control and how it influences the world.  Questions?  Comments?  Well then FUCK YOU.  I'm RIGHT.  You're the blind fool.
