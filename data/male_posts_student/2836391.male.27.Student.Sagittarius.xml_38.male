Work was extremely slow and boring, although with an absence of stupid customers/questions. On that note, I have a new champion in the "What is the most ridiculous Lotto related question someone can ask me" competition. This question I thought was particularly good - "Did the guaranteed millionaire go last week?" What does one do in this situation? Do I explain the definition of 'guaranteed', or do I just say 'yes it did' and leave it at that. Much as I would have enjoyed the sarcastic option, I went with the nice one.  In other news, I found out today I will be going to Wellington for a week in September as a student representative to the Teacher's Union National Conference. This should be quite interesting.  Finally, the facial hair poll continues.  urlLink Rach  has provided pictures of the possible before and after, so head over  urlLink there  and check it out, then come back and vote.
