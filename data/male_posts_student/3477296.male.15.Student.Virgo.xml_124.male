Yeh, Im sounding hella weird, but I never blog anyways and no one but Andy blogs. Reasons for Shutdown?  1. No one but Andy blogs. If he doesnt blog = Dustbowl. 2. Our privacys out the window. 3. No one gives a shit about our blog. 4. Its a fad. Lets get over it. 5. Sitting our your ass doesnt help you. 6. Prevents us doing work. 7. We go to a "good" school. Lets pretend that we are students of such a school.  I cant think of anymore but theres tonnes of reasons. What do you guys think???  Alright, now to shake off that weird shit, heres some emphatic words.  MANLY AND MAN UTD - DO IT FOR UR FANS Go Rockets. Go Swans. Go Australia in anything. GO CHINA>>>KICK JAPASS.
