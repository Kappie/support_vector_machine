I think fighting is for neanderthals. People that fight are people who can't verbalise their thoughts, and can't control themselves. They are on a par with abusive people. Both suck.  So, anyway, this woman comes on, probably an actress, but who cares. She says 'He hit me, and said it was my fault', and this subtitle comes on the screen and says 'IT'S NEVER YOUR FAULT'. Bullshit.  Ok, so I say again, fighting is for cavemen. However, it's NEVER your fault? I reiterate: bullshit.  It is possible that she was an abusive woman. That she was a nagging, irritating, abusive cow who couldn't shut the fuck up, which is a skill a hell of a lot more people need.  It may have indeed been his fault, but it's NEVER her fault? Bull.  If you women out there want equal rights, you should understand that you are not exempt from blame for ANYTHING. It is possible for women to be bitches. Women are imperfect.  Sorry ladies. IT'S TRUE!!
