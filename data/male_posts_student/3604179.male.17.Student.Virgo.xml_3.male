Now that I am done writing school papers, rough drafts, algebra problems and such, I'm ready to sit down and write again... Interesting huh? My school year ruled, funny that I already miss it. Being at home sleeping till 12 works for me though. I got my first job last summer, my driver's license, my first car, the list goes on. This year was fun. Well the first part of summer has been cool. Laker's Suck, I'm glad they lost the finals. Hockey's over, too bad the av's don't have the cup. Oh well, The Brew Crew is off to a great start. People might say, oh there at .500 whoopee doo, but I like the fact that they are winning. I haven't seen a winning season that I can remember in my life for the brewers. Hopefully this will be the year. Well, as long as I'm on the subject of sports, I might as well talk about ultimate Frisbee(Which is a hardcore sport!) especially when you play it with 15 people. Great times. Yesterday I had my first fishing trip of the year. Too bad it was at a hatchery. We weren't supposed to catch Bass because supposedly they kill there young if you catch them when they're spawning, but unfortunately, I felt the big bite, and before I knew it, I held up a 18-20" bass which is probably eating it's young at this very moment since I put it back. Wow, aren't I smart. Well anyway, that's not where it ended. After the fishing, I got to play softball, OH BOY! Coming into the game, our team was 1-3(The win I wasn't there because of my awesome chance to play guitar in the school pop concert, which was very fun indeed) So I was hoping that I wouldn't experience another loss. Coming into the game I had went 5-7 with a double and rbi, and had made no errors in Left Center Field(For all who don't know, our league allows 4 outfielders) My dad is the manager of the team and also plays. He told me I would be sharing time with another player and would sit on the bench for 3 innings, GREAT! Well the game didn't start off too well. We went down 3-0 in the first, and a lot of controversial calls by the umps lead to some fuss. I am playing in a league full of people who range from 16-75. It can get ugly, and it did this Monday. We hit horrible, and one of our players got kicked out, and I made an error(WOW, you kinda knew it would happen eventually) You would have had to be there to believe it. We lost by the 12 run rule in the 6th, We suck. I vaguely remember the bloop single I had in the 6th inning which was my only AB of the game. It was quite embarrassing, but it's over now, and I have to let it go. Maybe next week we'll get a win for me FINALLY! Yea, I bet. Well I'm finally done writing this post which took me almost a week to do, I'm cool, I'm hoping to write more tomorrow, of course not as long. Have fun everyone, your finally done reading this.
