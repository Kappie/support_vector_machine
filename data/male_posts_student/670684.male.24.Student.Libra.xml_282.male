I think it loses much of its psychological strength in that instance.  We never forget Act I of the film while watching Act II...and the gruesome nature of Act II is just commonplace.  Kubrick shows us what he wants to show us, and he wants us to see Act II, but gives us Act I so we are distanced from the situation, as the soldiers there are.  This isn't  urlLink Apocalypse Now , where mental resolve is questioned for all characters, or  urlLink Platoon , where the operations of war are in doubt.  Kubrick is playing a psychological game with his audience, and it works.  Nowhere have I read a review that gives the second half of the film as much love as the first...most say that the second half is superfluous.  If this were two movies, Kubrick would show them as two seperate movies.  They're not.  Without Act II, the first half could be considered cliche...we need an hour of violence and other seemingly commonplace war instance to buffer the first half, and show us what it would be like were we fighting in Vietnam.  Were we fighting, we'd look at it objectively and almost boringly.  You'd have to after living through becoming a Marine.    The last bit of media to make me think this much was the video to Johnny Cash's rendition of  Hurt .  Before that, it was  urlLink Memento .   Vincent D'Onofrio's cries still haunt me.  I lost sleep over it last night.  I will probably lose more.
