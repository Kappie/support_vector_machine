When you looked at your beautiful 2nd child and now you recall,  How you knew at once that I was a special thing.  Remember when I broke my leg by stepping in that hole,  At eighteen months before I could barely even walk!  How we made cookies together and I licked the bowl.  And all those important lessons on how not to stare and gawk.  Remember when you used to pick out my cute matching outfits.  And at preschool graduation how you thought time was flying!  How I've grown up so much since then bit by bit,  And now look where were at, you're reading this and crying.  Remember all those great achievements,  My first grade poster award, the talent show in 3rd, and now debate team.  Don't forget all the fun we had on our Disney land trips and family camp-out in tents.  And the four fun years of my life being on that basketball team.  Remember when I used to have that blonde curly hair,  And when I looked like a hippie with glasses in 5th grade.  How I used to do your hair up in pony tails everywhere,  Look at those special memories we've made.  It's only 8th grade graduation, but I'll be gone before you know it,  Off to collage, marriage, and my own life.  So I wanted to take a moment to make sure you know it,  For all that you've taught me and for sticking with me even through the strife,  Thanks, and I love you!
