ARgh history and econs were slightly better , my revision was half baked, couldnt realli concentrate..still some was better than nothing.  Right now i am feeling so weird, its like i see pple that i noe, but i dun have the guts to talk to them, this is especially when i am in class, i dun seem to be talking to my classmates as often as i used to ..SOme of them, i havent spoke a word to in like a few months...BLAR I MUST GET rid of this habit of mine. DIE!!!!!!!!!! I must not let shyness overcome me, or fear or whatever $%^% that stops me from socialising.  oh on sunday got lawn bowls competition, didnt do very well against the old pple who were super pro, in addition, got sunburn on my nose again as i was under the sun from morning to about 430 in the afternoon.  Now i shall think of ways to be more open to other ppl TATA!
