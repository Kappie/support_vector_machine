Alot of weird stuff in the news recently, tuition fees - that sucks, and the Hutton thingy, shame about Greg Dyke reseigning, ah well, I don't think anyone knows who to trust really.  I saw Freddy Vs Jason last night, it was actually pretty good, but could've been alot better, its understandable how most people thought it to be a failure, but hopefully the AVP Movie won't be a repeat of this.  And it's been snowing, not that you don't know, but it's something to mention, but now it's all slushy, hopefully it'll snow again tonight, or maybe keep snowing through February, doesn't look too likely, but seeing how this recent snow suddenly appeared from no where (to be fair the news/weather did meantion it) our chances of snow have increased.
