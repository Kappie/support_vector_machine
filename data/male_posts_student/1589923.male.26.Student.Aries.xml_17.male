Spent a long time discussing all the issues at nite, thrashing things out and missing the lecture the very next day. It seems like there are certain expectations we have of one another yet we aren't aware of it. Misunderstanding of each other's involvment and role in a relationship. It's like threading in a minefield, one wrong step, KABOOM. that's it. You are engaged in a pyschological battle between the 'right' and 'wrong'. It is often frustrating. I am not sure how's our relationship is going to turn out in the future. I have seriously no idea about it. It seems like the 2 of us are getting weary and it is diluting the whole relationship. Of course, i do treasure the times when i am with her and they are one of the best memories one can ever have. I have learnt so much from her and i realised my life is so bland compared to hers. i duno know why either. Maybe it's just her personality... the catalyst of my life. At this moment, i am going to take one step at a time. Where is it going to lead me? I guess i will find out some day.
