We live in a continuum of starts and ends. Likewise, breakup and new love are on the same line, probably in an alternate order. Breakup implies that new love is imminent. Unfortunately, sometimes it might be possible that new love is not in short order.   Do we live in a world of continuum and perpetuity?
