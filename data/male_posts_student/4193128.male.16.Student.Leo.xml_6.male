I felt like I just got slugged by a hammer or Sean Denz or Mike Ospina somehow landed all of their weight on my cheek and jumped up and down.  I had just got my wisdom teeth taken out and something was wrong.  Finally at 6 in the fin morning I knew   right away this trip was not going to be the pleasant trip I expected finally waking up we reach o hare grab a McDonalds sandwich I got a mcgriddle and sausage with two breakfast burritos mmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm its so good but so bad than picking at my right cheek I figured something was so swollen way in the back by my right molar that I started picking at it with my super sharp index middle finger nail the longest one missing my tooth totally hit my swelled up check puncturing it and squishing out the most awful tasting puss I’ve ever tasted but after getting all of the puss out the swelling went down and I finally didn’t feel like Sean denz sat on my face anymore yes this is how my vacation started out I was like oh boy  I cant wait till this     vacation gets even better.  Finally getting out of the mini size airport like 1 to 1000000th the size of O’Hare air port we go and get our rented car on the way over there I noticed a newspaper with hurricane Charlie on hitting Florida and I am like oh that sucks not thinking for a minute that the hurricane would soon be going straight for us finally we get our rental car and we our pinned behind two scvs we wait for like 55 minutes just to get out of the parking lot because the two cars behind us they lost the keys too and now it is absolutely pouring down pour.  And were like great. Finally we get out of there and we get directions to our hotel supposedly on the river front. We of course get lost and have a navigational fight go left no go straight no go right go up errrrrrrrrrrrr finally getting to our hotel we walk past the swimming pool which I’ve seen Jacuzzis bigger than and we go to our room which is on the opposite side of the river facing the most ugly parking lot in the world and were all like grreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaat finally we just passed out after watching the Olympics and went to bed .
