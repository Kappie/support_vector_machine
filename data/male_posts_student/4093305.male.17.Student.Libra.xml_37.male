I really should explain the "anarchism: act-a-vision activism" thing in the corner. Its nominal definition is pretty vague and its usage in everyday language as "chaos" or something like it is bound to confuse people.  I'd consider myself an anarchist in more of the classical sense of the term (think Mikhail Bakunin). While anarchism could be considered an ideology that advocated the abolition of the state, I'm of the sort that believes it is much more than that. I probably most resemble the anarchists that have the libertarian-socialist ideals, but differ in certain areas. I believe in a more methodological approach to social change. I try my best not to let my ideals get in the way of things; I don't like to burn bridges with people, but on the same note I don't take shit from anyone. I believe that direct action is the most effective way to bring about change.  A lot of progress is hindered when people want to believe things that aren't true and subsequently, many efforts are wasted on bad analysis on all sides of issues. But, there are all kinds of things that lead to bad analysis that I won't really go into (like the absurd amount of specialization in certain fields, which leads to an abstract analysis of real life situations, and a kooky analysis that often has bad implications). So, for these reasons, I don't really belong to any particular doctrine or group of people, but I find the term "anarchist" the most fitting for who I am. I'm anti-capitalist in just about every sense of the word, but I like the work of Austrian Economists for its praxeological approach to economics.  Now I hope you can understand the act-a-vision activism I have up there. To me, it means that we see ways to make the world better and act upon this vision. Kind of cheesy, but whatever. I think it's more rational of an approach than a lot of the left offers. The typical socialist takes a while to get warmed up with all their commitees and whatnot. I'd prefer to just start working and do my job well enough that it catches on.
