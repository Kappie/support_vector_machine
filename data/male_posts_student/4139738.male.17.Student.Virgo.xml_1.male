However, under the first two clauses of the 14th amendment, people must not be deprived of their liberties without due process and are subject to equal protection of the law.  This means someone could get married to another of the same sex in Massachusetts and come to, say, Ohio, and declare their marriage legal.  This would be frigging revolutionary and I don't understand why someone hasn't done anything about it yet.  I looked it up in the massachusetts marriage laws, and a minor can be married with the consent of the parents.  Anybody want to go to Massachusetts and get married to one another?
