Met my cousin there, then we went to isetan changing room to film (i went in alone) and then Giordano coz the theme is on Materialism liddat one, so filming changing rooms may come in use...not bcoz i m a pervert...the later went to 10min haircut salon to film a little, and stuff lahz...my cousin  ditched me by then, and i had to trudge around Marine Parade alone...  hmz hope i got more ideas tomolo...needta film MRT train and advertisements...glad nxt wk only got unseen poetry lit test..dunnit to stardi one...
