I was around people I knew there.  Now, I've just got nothing to do, and nobody is online (when I'm sitting at the computer, at least).  So, before I go into things that have crossed my mind, I'll go through what I've tried to do today:   Failed Attempts at Keeping Myself Entertained:  -Movies: If only a good movie was on T.V., I wouldn't be watching the same DVDs that I watch on a regular basis.  I watched School of Rock, Spiderman, and Pirates of the Caribbean today, but, it was incredibly boring.    -TV: NOTHING is on T.V.  So that was a failure.  -Reading: Yes, I actually do read once in a while.  I started to read the first book in the Left Behind series.  Fell asleep.  -Games: Tried turning on my Xbox.  Rallisport Challenge just doesn't seem to have the same effect on me as it used to.  So, as you can tell, it was a very boring day, and I think I would rather sit and count Mr. Murray's "You got thats," but, class is over.  And I thought it would be a good thing, but now I'm just bored sick.  It's too hot to go to Universal or anything, so I'm not going to.    So...what's been going through my mind today, aside from being completely bored to death?   Alex and the Weirdo:  I must admit, I left drivers ed yesterday with a positive thought, and that was Alex faking an argument with that kid I don't like that sat behind me.  The situation goes something like this.  The kid (who shall be referred to as J.J. here), ALWAYS has his sunglasses on.  Yesterday, he left them on his desk when he went to talk to the teacher, and Alex grabbed them and put them in his sweatshirt pocket thingy.  Then, I started cracking up (because I ruin everything, and I admit that), and J.J. was like "alright, where are they?"  Well, I had moved his bookbag so that Alex could throw the sunglasses in there, and then J.J. got the bookbag, then started accusing me and Alex of taking his sunglasses.  Alex "went off" on him (acting it, of course), calling him a jackass and stuff.  It was definitely one of the funnier moments of the class.  Until Caitlin yelled at me for it.  Then it wasn't funny any more.   Spiderman 2:  I'm really mad.  I was watching TV a few nights ago, and I saw a preview for Spiderman 2, and it COMPLETELY ruined parts of the movie that I didn't want to hear about until I saw the movie.  Even so, the movie is still going to be filled of surprises.  Which is good, because I haven't been looking forward to a movie like Spiderman 2 since the first one.     The Chronicles of Riddick:  I didn't know Vin Diesel had the capability of being a good actor.  Anyway, this is the sequel to Pitch Black, and boy, did it turn out good.  I went and saw it last weekend in Ocala, and it was awesome.  Now, I just want to try the videogame (because I've still got some nerdism in me), because it's supposed to be even better than the movie.     Senior Pictures:  Appears like I won't be having my senior pictures taken until August, because my driving days for drivers ed are the same days. Oh well.  Maybe I'll have time for that dramatic change I've been dyinf for.  So, anyway, that's pretty much all that's going through my mind right now.  Hopefully I won't have to write another "Absolute Boredism" post for at least a week, but, we'll see.  Until I post again, go away.
