Little Girl has been a part of my family since I was six or seven years old. She's been with us as long as I can remember. She's over twenty years old, and this is probably to be expected...still, I hate seeing her in pain, but I don't want to see her go. I'll miss petting her, scratching behind her ear when she's looking for affection. I'll even miss when she jumps on my lap when I'm not expecting it and rips up a new pair of shorts I'm wearing. It will be hard adjusting to life without her. I'm not normally a spiritual person, but I hope for her sake that if there is such a thing as an afterlife, that she's well taken care of. If there isn't, then I can only hope to provide her last moments of life on this Earth with as much love and care as I possibly can.    Okay, that's our sentimental portion of today's blog update.  Now, on to other updates.    Still haven't gotten my paper back in Senior Seminar, meaning I'll have only a week to rewrite. This is bad, because my paper is a steaming pile of shit (unless Professor Schmidt happens to be reading this. In that case, it's the greatest paper of all time). Today I handed in a portfolio that was only slightly better. The work inside the portfolio was top notch. My resume is damn sharp, and when I get done with my page update, I'm going to post it on there for one and all to see, because it is a work of art. And I designed it! Me, mister no artistic vision whatsoever, made a damn beautiful resume. Unfortunately, the work around the resume was just kind of haphazardously thrown in there. One out of my three references wasn't asked recently to be a reference (unless Dr. Schmidt is reading this, in that case...every reference was asked and checked and there are no problems to report!). Now coming up we have to do a final presentation of everything we've learned in our years at Monmouth. This should be interesting, because we're supposed to be split up into groups, and I don't know who is in my group, because I missed class today. Note to self...don't miss class during introduction of group members. I'm sure this will resolve itself, because I'm the master of landing on my feet in situations similar to this.    My radio show is going well. So far, I haven't been thrown off the air. That's a plus. My Thursday shift has been concentrating more about talking about music of late, because none of my friends listen to this shift, so I make an attempt to actually keep the listeners who tune in. And finally, we got the Sunday situation figured out. I finally ran into the WMCX PD today, and he said he'd make sure I'm on the list this week and in future weeks so I can do my show from the WMCX studios on the campus of Monmouth University. Yay. I really do enjoy doing these shows, it's one of my highlights of the week. Editing my tapes down to only five minutes or so will be tough, but I think I can get some good stuff on there. And please, if you have the ability to listen, go to the link above and listen to my shows Thursday from 12-3 and Sunday from 3-6.    Let's see, what else...the Nets ripped my heart out. Fucking Bruce Ratner. 40% of a starting lineup that went to the fucking finals two out of the last three years...gone. Fuck you, Ratner. John Franco sucks. Hang it up, old man. You've got nothing left but your pride, and with every despicable outing you throw, you lose a piece of that too. Wiggy might be traded...that would also ruin my day. Ty Wigginton is my favourite Mets player, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. If he goes to the Pirates, I will not be amused. I think those are my sports beefs this week.    Things are also shaping up for my graduation party. The invites have been sent out, and most of the people I'd expect to be there have said that they can make it. Hopefully, I'll hear from a few others as well. This is going to be a good ol' time. I've never had anything thrown in my honour before, mostly because I've never done anything honourable. Graduating college in seven years still doesn't seem very honourable to me, but it should still be an awesome time. The party will be at my aunt and uncle's, so there will be plenty of room to commisserate, play games, some swimming...even for Joe's planned Commencement Ceremony, to take place in my aunt's backyard. I can hardly wait.    Maybe the reason I don't update this so much is because I put too much in one update! I'm going to try to make some shorter updates more often. In the meantime, please leave feedback so I know people read this. My cat is crying, so I'm gonna go make sure she's okay. In the meantime, you take care, youngster.
