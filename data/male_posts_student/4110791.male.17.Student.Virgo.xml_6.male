Then Shawn called, and he said that he wanted me to mow the lawn and clean the kitchen, but I ended up mowing the lawn, and Bill cleaned the kitchen :p  When I got done mowing the lawn, and Bill got done cleaning the kitchen, we went to an abandoned house about 3/4 of a mile down our back driveway, and shot .22's around, that was pretty fun :)  Shawn's stupid black lab Ash is going to get shot... She walks right in front of us while we are shooting :S  But, we managed not to shoot her, which is a good thing... Shawn would kill us if we shot his dog :S  Yesterday was alot more fun and interesting than today :)  I went over to Kendall's house at about 12:30, and we played Nintendo games :)  Her mom had a chance to make fun of her, and embarass her, and she did :) Kendall turned red :p I had lots of fun :)  Then at about 4:30 Jesse and I left to go back to his house, and we talked about going swimming, and so when we got back I messaged Kendall to see if she could go swimming with us, I'm very happy that she got to go with us :)  We all had lots of fun :)  Kendall and I got to kiss and make out :) That was lots of fun too :p  After that, Jesse drove Kendall home, and then we went back to his house for about a half an hour, and left for my house :)  For some reason nobody beleive's me when I say that I live a long ways out in the country :p  After I got home, I ate dinner.  Steak and potato salad, it was really good :)  After that we all watched Bull Riding, because there wasnt anything else good on, and because Shawn likes to watch Bull Riding :p  After that, it was about 11:00 and I went to bed :)  Even though I didnt fall asleep until at least 12:30... that was the last time I looked at the clock :S  But I eventually went to sleep, and had very sweet dreams :)
