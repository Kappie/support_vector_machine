I thought he vanished off the face of the Earth in 1988 when he ingloriously (if that's not a word, it should be!) dropped out of the Presidential race.  I don't know why I'm linking this article.  Maybe because my counter tells me I've had 5 visitors in the last hour, and I feel obligated to post something new.  It's an interesting article, though -- and check it out quickly... because if I come up with anything better to post today, this link'll be gone.  :)
