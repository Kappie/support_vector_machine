Like for example, people complain so much about how games these days don't have the same  replay  and  gameplay  value as back then. But thenagain, it does, not in the same way. It's what you call  online  gaming, something that has gotten bigger. Just like VHS and DVD, they play movies, yes, but not the same way... sort of the same analogy, but in the same sense, different. Remember people, it's the year 2004, not the year 1995, so if you want much of the same, your stuck playing a handheld like the GBA, or just going old school with your SNES, NES and any other systems you have from back then. But don't be looking for old school in new school games, cause apparently, these game developers are looking to move  foward , not  backward  in the gaming industry.
