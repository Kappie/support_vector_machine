I do, however, have a Yahoo account that I use from my Home page as well as Yahoo! Messenger and e-mail. I was quite excited to see that they offer much more space now, more than I've had on any e-mail account I've ever had, even when I was paying for it. In addition to the 100MB of storage, the interface is cleaned up, and I can now send messages up to 10MB. Looks like I've got a new personal e-mail address, a good thing because the move will make my Charter one unusable. I'll probably get an e-mail through SBC DSL just so the family, teachers, and College Board/Colleges have an e-mail address that doesn't proudly use the word "homo". It just isn't very profesional.  Oh, and by the way, if you haven't tried it, the Blogger "BlogThis!" bookmark thingy is very cool. I used it for this. With blogging this easy I'll be doing it day and night, not that I don't now. If you'll excuse me I've got  Blow This! ,  Queer Eye , and  Sex and the City  to watch. Bye now!
