The guys at the ticket station said only 3 of us (Out of six) could fly on Air Canada, the rest would have to cancel the flight or go on American Airflights. My dad decided to take American with 2 of my bros. My mom and my bro went with me on Air Canada.   The trip in plane took something like 10 hours (The first Airplane) and then 1 hour. I was tired when i arrived in Toronto and  even more when we finally landed at Montreal.   I`m on a not-so-good pc with a not-so-good version of windows messenger, so any questions or comments should be forwarded to lucidique@gmail.com   More to come ,believe me, i`m just really tired now.  Regards,  Zephyr
