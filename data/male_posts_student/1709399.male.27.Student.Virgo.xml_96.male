My Huge Collection of cassettes  CD's have finally found an avenue now . Now that Winter has set in Delhi , I would be forced to curb most of my Outdoor Travel and hence thought of gifting myself this player.                                                 I have always believed Philips is a Wonderful value for Money. All my previous Audio systems have been Philips and they have been very long lasting and the sound effects have also been equally impressive ( Well Sony,Kenwood Belong to a Different Category but then I don't want to spend that much money).
