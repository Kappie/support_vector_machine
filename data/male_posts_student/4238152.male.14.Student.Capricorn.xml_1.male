His catch phrase though I only heard it once, was “I know I look like a fool talking to you people on stage.” Real fascinating. And much recently, the most  respectable  Mdm. Neo joined those ranks too. Her catch phrase, “I know that even before I start (speaking) some of you will call me ‘ siao ’ but I have to do so for the sake of the class.” Sounds like a true blue PAP supporter eh? Now before I digress into PAP politics, let me make mention of Mdm. Neo’s most  commendable  speech all of which happened within the four walls with a hole in class 3 / 2. The bell was just about to go. I was as usual waiting to bid farewell being the most courteous student that I am. Today had been a most meaningful Geography lesson. Why? Because Shawn was seating with us and Bo Hui had apparently skipped the first lesson, lost count of time and didn’t even turn up for school, which, is a good thing. Shawn had served very well as my  personal entertainer  but in Mdm Neo’s undisputed opinion, he was a personal disaster. And disaster there was! Mdm. Neo took it t herself to berate the two of us. Quite simply, she stood at the OHP as she always does (because no one will think of having her near themselves) and for the ninth time looked as if though she was on the verge of an emotional breakdown, placed her marker down, glared at us (Rather contradictory, beats me too. But Mdm. Neo is most unpredictable at times) and started her little speech. “I don’t wish to say this but there are a few students who are very disruptive. They choose not to or cannot fir into society and form their own group or a delinquent subculture. They value things which society doesn’t value a lot.” Pauses to look at Shawn and I then draws some weird diagram on the OHP before continuing, “Things like rudeness and defiance,” pauses again to look at us. And so her speech goes, punctured with sporadic pauses now and then and also injected with Shawn’s cynical remarks and our laughter. Little is known as to why Mdm. Neo embarked on her highly controversial and questionable speech. Some kind souls who were most touched by her speech said that she was sincere for once. Not very credible but it’ll do. Shawn on the other hand had an entirely different opinion. “Sincerity will not melt stone.” That sounds more like my idea of the  catch phrase  of the year! Indeed Mdm. Neo must have been a sorry sight. But I beg to differ. One, we (Shawn and I) have come to a conclusion – That must have been a publicity stunt which further proves her mental instability. We don’t mean that in a bad way. All we want to say is Mdm. Neo seemed rather out of touch today like as if though she was leaving us (which I hope she would and also leave for good) and that speech was some sort of farewell speech. Two, we wish to thank her for her kindness and concern but could she please wake up to the notion of actions speak louder than words and help us ace our Geography instead? Or must she in what is supposed to be thoughtful and sincere insult us. Not that she came hard on but she played it cool with nearly 80% of her little speech directed at us. We applaud her for her subtleness but hope that as soon as  sows  learn to fly, so would she learn the true meaning of sincerity. This refers to being forthright and to the point. For example, Shawn and I were discussing the different ways to shut Mdm. Neo up. Suggestions raised included throwing the pen knife at her, flinging paper balls and last but not least, walking out of the class. Unfortunately, we were mentally sound and ran through those ideas once more and the verdict was – lets just sit here enjoy the air con and annoy Mdm. Neo. This might sound very passive in comparism to the aforementioned ideas and we can’t agree more. For now, we shall follow by example – that is to say learn from Mdm. Neo. She’s not the only one who can do things subtlety. We shall show her our appreciation by sitting together during her future lessons and see how long it’ll take before she yells at us and flings the OHP over (Now you know why she stands next to the OHP and not outside the class). Bearing that in mind, as good OP supporters, we shall declare, “That has been long enough” I know, I know, you’re referring to my article.  Nofing is still unable to get over the incident, having been influenced by Mdm. Neo’s mental instability; he now takes to drawing a flying sow wearing a cloak bearing the alphabets NEO on it. Of course we all know he’s a big fan of the matrix.
