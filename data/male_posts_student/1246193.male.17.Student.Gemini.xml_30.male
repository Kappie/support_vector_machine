I don't think she realized it but she kind of sent me into panic mode for the day.  I have issues, you all know that.  One of my "issues" is the immediate future.  Jennifer J. calls it paranoia.  I don't think I am paranoid, I just worry about things I have no control over (again the perfectionist coming out in me).  I am worried about college. First of all, where will I go.  Everyone seems to know what they want to do with their life.  I have no idea.  I had an inspiration and I told my mom.  I will spend four years getting a bachelor's degree and figuring out what I want to do with my life, then grad school getting the education that I need for my selected field.  That sent my mother into panic mode.  Primarily because I am looking at very small, very private, and very  expensive  schools.  She doesn't want me to have to pay off college loans for the rest of my life, or so she says.  I think it is more that my parents don't want to be paying for eight or nine years of college.  I try to explain my fear, but no one seems to understand.  You all embrace what comes next while I am running as fast as I can the other way.  I need structure in my life.  Someone telling me what choices to make.  Maybe I should go to an asylum.  They tell you exactly what to do, all in a very positive environment.  Hmmmmm.   I am scared of the dark that is what is to come.
