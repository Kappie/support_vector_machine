It's undescribable.  The English test itself wasnt too bad, I think I anticipated it to be much worse, considering the practices seemed to be much more difficult than the test itself.  Also, what a relief that one of the essay prompts wasnt based on a passage.  I hope everyone else felt that they did well... Congrats on surviving the AP experience.
