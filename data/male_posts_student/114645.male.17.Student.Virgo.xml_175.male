One afternoon when the President is returning from a trip to his Texas ranch, he gets off the helicopter in front of the White House with a baby pig under each arm.  The Marine guard snaps to attention, salutes, and says: "Nice pigs, sir!"  The President smirks and says, "Well, that's where you're wrong, soldier. These are not pigs. These are authentic Texan Razorback Hogs. I got one for VP Cheney, and I got one for Defense Secretary Rumsfeld."  The Marine again snaps to attention, salutes, and replies, "Nice trade, sir!"
