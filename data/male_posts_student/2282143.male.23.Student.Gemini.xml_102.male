On my vacation of all times too, so that cancels that, and not to sound mean, but I really wanted to get away and relax for the first time all summer but now I cant do that. Im very mixed on the whole thing. On one hand, she is my grandma. Thats my father's mother. She was a pain in the butt to him, but it was his mother. On the other hand, I had no real great memories of her like I did with the other grandma. She didnt like me, she didnt like my mom, and she would give the other boys money and me nothing, but of course my dad would split it up three ways cause he's awesome like that. And I think Im most sad that there was no closure like with my other grandma. We said our goodbyes and were at peace with everything. This time, it was cold and institutional. She just crashed, heart and kidneysfailed and that was it. No goodbyes or anything. I even feel horrible because I havent talked to her in a while except for briefly on Tuesday when she heard that my other grandma died. I dont think there was anyone from the family when it happened. Maybe my uncle was there, but I dont know. And I just think of the two and realized the duality of this, just like nature. Sometimes its with the ones you love and a familiar place and other times, its alone and in a strange environment. You wonder why our culture has a messed up perception on death and dying and things like that. Well, when I get home, I will burn my incense, meditate, and try and be at peace with the events of the week.  Sam had a good point. At least it was fast. No drawn out illness, no pain that I know of, just like going in your sleep. Its the only thing I could have hoped for.  Oh yeah. Funny story about dinner tonight with Kristin and Ryen. But that is for a happier blog.
