I have been a very active Quizzer right from my Schooling days and have been part of Quiz Organizations  online Quiz Groups. Yesterday I got the Wonderful oppurtunity to Host a Quiz at my office on the Topic "Social Awareness  Drive Safety Awareness". Yeah it was Quiz with a Difference . Under the Aegis of Social Services Committee , I conducted a Quiz on Social Workers , NGO's , Community awareness etc. I will post the Questions shortly on this site.                            At the end of the day it was an immensely satisfying experience to have conducted a Quiz which I hope spurred people to make a Difference to the Society.
