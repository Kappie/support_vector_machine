Well i have been studying during the long holiday we had, unlike someone ( whose name i will not mention ) i know who dosen't study at all, instead all he will do is play and play initial D ( if this is the way you spell it ), or whatever, some people have been trying to ask me to take a break and cool down, de stress, but somehow the more i try to de stress, the more stressed i get, find no logic in that though.k so i better go back any study more!! bye
