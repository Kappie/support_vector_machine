Black and White Cookie  (BAKER is behind the counter at a bakery, carefully setting out his black-and-white cookies.  He sings a little tune.)  BAKER (singing) Black and white cookies are nice and sweet Make for a fine dessert time treat All the men and women they love to eat My secret ingredient’s a half a pound of meat...  (CUSTOMER walks in)  CUSTOMER Good morning, Mr. Baker.  BAKER Good morning, hungry-looking sir.  CUSTOMER You know, I was just thinking the other day what a fine coincidence it is that your last name is Baker, and you happen to be a baker.  BAKER That’s no coincidence, sir.  I changed my name.  My last name used to be Cleans the Sewer.  CUSTOMER How pleasant.  BAKER But enough about me and how I didn't wash my hands before I baked these cookies.  How can I help you?  CUSTOMER I’d like a black and white cookie, please.  BAKER Excellent choice.  Since they’re the only things I have.  Here you go.  (he hands Customer a cookie)  CUSTOMER (he gasps in shock)  Mr. Baker, this cookie is at least 90 percent white.  There’s hardly any black at all on here.  BAKER Really?  CUSTOMER Really.  Take a look.  (Baker takes a look.)  BAKER Wow.  You’re right.  I hadn’t realized that.  CUSTOMER Don’t you use a ruler, or measure out the frosting, or some other way to ensure an equal mix of black and white?  BAKER No can do.  The Supreme Cookie Court outlawed quotas.  In an opinion written by Justice Candy.  CUSTOMER I think you mean Justice Kennedy.  BAKER Perhaps.  In any event, I can’t have a set amount of black and white frosting in mind when I start.  I can’t have a target I’m trying to meet, or any kind of system aimed at ensuring equality.  I just need to wing it, and kind of try to make sure there’s a decent mix of the two.  But no quotas.  CUSTOMER But I like the black side better, and there’s hardly any black on my cookie.  BAKER That’s not my fault, sir.  I don’t make the rules, I just make the cookies.  I don’t know why you don’t like the white frosting.  It’s without question the most qualified frosting there can be on a cookie of this type.  It passed the quality inspection with flying colors, mostly white, which I guess isn’t really a color... but anyway, it comes from very stable parents – flour and sugar, very well respected in the baking community – and it’s really well-positioned to flow through your digestive system smoothly and end up in the sewer without incident.  And I know the sewer system quite well from my last job, before I changed my name.  CUSTOMER That’s all well and good, but I like the black side better.  I want more of it.  BAKER No one told you to come to my bakery, sir.  This is an elite institution.  I’ve baked for David Duke.  You could have gone to the co-op down the street, or just gotten an apple pie at Burger King.  Or bought some cookies from the unaccredited store on the Internet.  I hear they’re getting very popular.  But if you want to buy a cookie from my bakery, you need to realize that the frosting has certain standards it needs to meet.  CUSTOMER But the black frosting tastes so sweet...  BAKER That’s ridiculous.  It’s the same ingredients.  You’re imagining things.  CUSTOMER But if it's the same ingredients... why are they different colors?  BAKER What am I, a scientist?  I'm just a baker.  Take your perplexing questions elsewhere.  I don't make sense, I just make cookies.  (CUSTOMER 2 enters.)  BAKER May I help you?  CUSTOMER 2 Yes, I’d like to place an order for some dark pumpernickel bread.  CUSTOMER 1 You gonna give him white bread instead, Mr. Baker?  BAKER No, you ignorant fool.  Everyone knows the Supreme Cookie Court has absolutely no jurisdiction over bread.   Bread's covered by a statute.  (blackout.)
