American Studies sucks more suckily than a sucking sucky suckfest.  That thing is getting old.  I need something new.  For gym, I'm taking World Games first semester and AM PE second semester.  Tell me if anyone else is taking those then.  Also, Driver's Ed first semester.  And I know that that was a sentence fragment.  Hopefully I won't get raped.  And the big chihuahua, I'm taking SECOND-year Spanish next year.  How did the Almeista manage that?  Because I'm so awesome.  Yeah, I definitely should refrain from calling myself "the Almeista."  Oh and Creative Writing second semester, I got the urge after writing my Loren short story.  Another sentence fragment.  And another.  OK I'll stop pointing them out now.  I may or may not be seeing "The United States of Leland" with Ben Ostrow tomorrow.  That whole plan is so fraught with peril, as Ms. Green would say.  In Mock Trial, I think I'm going to focus on Sherriff Barnes.  For those of you who don't know the case, it's a murder trial, and Barnes is the one who arrested the defendant.  The defendant allegedly killed the victim with a tire iron, so I draw a cartoon that showed him ironing his shirt with a tire.  Craig thought it was funny; Stephanie Kaplan did not.  That's another thing, there's been some controversy over calling some people by their first names and calling others by their full names.  And by some controversy I mean Jessica Li complained.  My argument is that certain people, such as Jessica Li and Stephanie Kaplan, are just always identified by their full names (by people like Duke and me); whereas others, like Melody and Orin, are always identified by their first names only.  That's just what they're called, and that's the essence of a name.  And now I'm rambling.
