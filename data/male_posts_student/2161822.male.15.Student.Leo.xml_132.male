Watching movies until 3 in the morning doesn't really work well. After hanging out with I-da-men and watching about 10 million SOAD videos, he has me addicted to them. They're 100 times better live. Nothin really ground-shattering to post. The past week was awesome. First week of summer. Couldn't of went better. ....Well, it could have but you know. I realized now that each sentence has a totally new topic. That keeps everyone on the edge of their seat. Jhea man. English isn't for me. Either is blogging. Screw this.  Currently wasting time and becoming deaf listening to Thursday   I hate windows media player. It never frigging works. Ever.
