Well except for the exams...but those don't count =P. Oh yes the sweet smell of freedom just around the corner. It can be mocking, yet assuring =). Just to think in a matter of a week, i don't have to worry about waking up at 730am anymore, or getting to school on time. Ahh yes...in a matter of 5 days, all I have to worry about is studying for bio and math, and playing PS2, balling, and back to my summer workout schedule...yup....and of course just chillin'. Also I find in the summer I sometimes have the best times doin devos and gettin closer to Christ. Nothing in your mind to get you off track =P.  Well for another day of school...  Today in music we had some stupid theory test. Mr. Boldt the retard still doesn't seem to understand how to write scales, so our whole class is doing it wrong. I tried to correct him, as well as some other students, but him being the old head of the Laurier music departnment, he's an idiot. Plus....LAURIER S.S....I bet an average Central student knows more about music than that guy. Oh yeah and afterwards....we used insufficient tools to clean the instruments...well more like 3 trumpets. It was pretty stupid...  Science: Studied dirt. Yup.  Lunch: Kelsey WAS supposed to come practice, but in the end she didn't really come....so I ended up talkin' to Dave Rutt a lot about senior music...well he's graduating and I'm plannin' to do jazz band, wind ensemble...you know the works =P. Sight read Jessica Winegart's piece while she was waiting for Freddy Wu...who came afterwards. Then I practiced my solo for a bit...and then left.  Bio....watched videos and did some homework.  English: Presentations.....bleh. I do mine next week =P  And then after school had to practice Niki's solo with her. That went pretty good...and then after that...well I got bored...didn't feel like busing...so went to Jason's house lol.  ....Yeah so I walked there with my l33t sense of direction and then arrived at his place around....yeah 330 or so. We walked down to Rogers Video then and rented some RPG game and also stopped by at A to end my craving for cheesebuns lol. I don't know why...yesterday @ A though...I saw cheesebuns and had a real craving for them. So I bought some today, since I didn't have a lunch today anyways and managed to munch on 3 of them before we got back to Jason's place.  Watched a episode of Friends *he has the season packs* and then started playing the game. Forgot what it's called...but it resembles Gauntlet a lot. Heh me and David played that for GC a lot so I got hooked on this game pretty quick lol. Resembles D2 more though...but pretty good I thought. Wish we had gotten NBA Ballers...but they didn't have copies *blast.* So afterwards Jason then ate two of my remaining 3 cheesebuns, and I had my final one on my way home when Dad picked me up around 6pm or so.  Then got home...and here I am now. Drummed, ate some food, ate some more food, chatted w/ Gerty, Maisie and Ju on MSN for a bit...and then...yeah....that's pretty much it. Gonna SC soon I think. I have no will to go to UCC tonight....beat tired.  Hehe cya.
