You know the world would be a better place if they'd only let you be in charge of it, and if they don't appreciate your genius by themselves you're willing to make them. You've got good hair, a secret base and an ambivalent relationship with the bishounen hero. You've got the money, the women, the best mecha and your own private army, but you  still  lose in the end to some jumped-up kid with spiky hair. There is no justice.   urlLink  Which generic anime character are you?           And for a short while today, I had admin privileges on tweedy's blog.  I took his away.  Then I gave them back.  Now I am no longer an admin.  I got a new laptop today.  Oh, the joy.
