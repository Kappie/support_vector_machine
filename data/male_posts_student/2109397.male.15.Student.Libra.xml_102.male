Do not waste your time.  Anyways, Day 4 of conditioning came and went. It wasnt too hard but it was hard enough. That stupid asshole Rob who is our "conditioning coach" showed up with like 10 minutes left. So I only heard his gay fucking ass voice once today. Tomorrow is supposedly our last day with him but it'll probably be the worst day of my life. I guess I'll get over it.
