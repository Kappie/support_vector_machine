Not that I'm a big stickler for PC stuff, but after Fez on That 70's show, I think it has all been played out. Two, it was positively brilliant to make a film about a dork and the preppy kids in high school. Never been done before or better. BRILLIANT. Three, there is a thing called "plot" and generally some "character development" in stories and movies. Both were lacking. Finally, relying on a kid's goofy looks for laughs for a full length movie gets old. I will also say that the viewing was somewhat spoiled by North Shore copycat mallrats decked in A with glowing cellphones and fake tans.   Oh yeah, I predict, if it hasn't happened already, that this will be the most quoted (rather misquoted) film for the next, let's say, 3 months. Legions of idiots who have been craving new Chappelle show quotes are now saved and will yell "Sweet" drunkenly in the streets. And Napoleon will be the "hot" Halloween costume of Frat Boys.  I hold out that this film might pull a Lebowski and become funnier on repeated viewings, but that's a slim chance.   PS  The other thing that seriously got to me about the film was the whole "80s" look.  Actually, that's not right, it is the fact that everything looks cerca 1985 but with the Internet.  Either the writers were trying to be clever with how everyone in that town is out of the loop, or as I suspect, they were just really lazy.
