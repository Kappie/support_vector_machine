As the facilitators and coordinators are not there yet, and the youths are "dancing" the bamboo dance at the pavailion, we go and join them. It is very fun and interesting and the beat goes " Bom Bom Pa " and the " pa " that beat, they slide the bamboo poles one! Wow, i kena snape once... and it really hurts... It is really fun to try with... haha, esp with fast speed... keke.  urlLink    "Their bamboo dance!! Nice nice!!" urlLink     After that, we have a small sharring session, share about my feelings and thoughts about the foster home programme. And... i represent my group [each grp one representative] BUT 4 of us allocate the parts who talk about what.... haha, i get the most easy one... talk about plucking the vegetables... [not i choose one, i left with that option nia]. BUT we still help each other, add in more details =)  Then, we are splitted into groups again to plan and prepare our stations for tomorrow's World Environment Day 2004! My Group is incharge of colouring and games... under category 4. Firstly, we start off with the planning with Kim (one of the facillitator from RIC). We have a thorough one and that's all. Whaha, no need set up anything =p Then, all of us go and help the other groups in setting up thier stations. The bad thing is that, we could not complete all tasks before luncg, so, we have to walk all the way back to our resort and have our lunch and then walk all the way back to RIC and continue.   Then, I volunteer to go around and ask for people's t-shirt size (wahaha, free WED tee leh~~left L and XL only though). Then, i followed Eugene, Kenneth and one of the twins (I think is Liang Thing if not wrong) to hunt for leech... Wow, we really walk all the way in from the other side of the bridge till the tracks are very vague. So sad, we cant find any... (we are given a time by Mr Ng and expect us to be back by that time). Then I start to help out in getting pond water and the flush down the drain. Haha, clearing the drain is a huge "project" and we call off our day in RIC with the drains -___-""   Dinner time~ and it's Joel's Birthday!! We sing birthday songs to him in chinese, english and malay!! Wahaha, nice dinner + fresh prawns and banana!! Wow, how generous is that Mrs Lim! Wow, the best dinner man~! Thanks Joel!!!  After dinner, I have my life journey. Hmm, it's not very well-planned and I have missed a couple of things... but nevermind, I have covered most of the things I wanna say and I feel really really relieved. Now think back... my life is kinda colourful and corny! Haha, sports day, primary sch teachers, primary sch dental nurse, sec sch etc... and even YJ and sabah!! If i did not choose to stay in YJ, I would not be able to come to this expedition, which allows me to experience something new, see things in different aspects, make a bunch of great friends and of course, uncover myself.... I difinately nevery choose the wrong choice!  *And got a new nickname: Kodomo
