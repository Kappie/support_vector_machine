Ryan's domain...  being the... writer and all........ so... yeah...  The first thing that everyone needs to understand is that Empty Space  is based off all the members of this Weblog, plus a few who aren't on  ::coughcough:: Cameron ::coughcough:: since he got his net taken  away... I'll bet any one of you can guess why a guy would get the net  taken away...........  Anyways, Empty Space pretty much sums up all of our personal  experiences... err, well... some extremely random experiences... for  example, when Cameron, Ryan, Kevin, and I were at Lake Berryessa the  other weekend, Cameron wouldn't STFU about 'Steve' and 'Steve's  Mother'. This was only 1 of the EXTREMELY hilarious things that  happened that weekend, off the top of mah head I can recall around 7  things just like this that happened...  Okay, that's the summary of the comic, and its origin, anyways, the  plot:  keep lookin' you won't find one of these things... pff, 'Plot', what  kind of idiot cares about a plot, this is supposed to be a 'RANDOM'  comic of 'RANDOMNESS'........ R-A-N-D-O-M, got that?..... good job.  O wellZ, the reason this Weblog is going to be used is so that we can  get feedback on, one: Ryan's scripts/Stories of randomness; two: mah  artwork for the comic... and just some of mah artwork... whenever I get  bored....... shutup, its goin here anywayZ.  Wow this post is getting VERY long, o well... im kewl that way,  muhahahaha.  The next thing I will ask Ryan to post about, is the 'Alternate Space'  (name in the worx) this is the sub-universe of Empty Space, it involves  some even more random things that happen to all of our 'alternate  egoes'. I'll let Ryan explain our....... karazy selves, all Ima say is  that im 'Jynx'... I kick ass..... you know its true...  Okay, ima go now, mah fingers hurt from typing, and im getting  hungry..... Curry time, w00t w00t.
