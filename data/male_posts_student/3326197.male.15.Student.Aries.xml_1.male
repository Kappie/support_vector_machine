We sent in our subject selection thingos for year 11 today. I also got myself outta a History assignment, now i got another week to do it! :P My left ear is burning and Mel is ignoring me on the net. Oh wait, now she started talking. Lol... She liked to 'brb' alot. OMG this arvo i was channel surfing n i saw this lil kid's show called New Macdonalds farm and it had two people (well, they werent real) and they looked exactly like Tom and Mel! It was sooooo funny. Now my ears ringing. Their names were Milly and Max it was funny. Yeah, i'm boring. I'm tired meh. Today i'm gonna bludge the arvo and not do anything. God i seem boring. I'm gonna go check out my forum now. Cyaz for now. :)
