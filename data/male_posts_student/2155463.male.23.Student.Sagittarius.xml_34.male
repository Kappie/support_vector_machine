More specific elements of this (i.e. relationships with girls, etc.) are even worse.  As I often relate about myself, "If you want to see me FREAK OUT, put me in a group of people I don't know and tell me to mingle."  Of course, I'm not all that much better with people I do know...  I still don't know why this is.  Maybe it's the early-childhood homeschooling, maybe the ultra-fundamentalist views I was exposed to early on, maybe it's just the way I am...who knows?  Of course, none of this would change the way things are...and I just am SO conflict-averse.  I swear, I'll be sitting in class and we'll be discussing something, and I can see the whole discussion unfolding in front of me and I get some kind of lock-jaw; it's not just that I won't talk, but I get very tense.  Sometimes I'll walk out of a class exhausted, yet not having said a word and not really even remembering much of what was said.  I think the answer might be to actually going back to having an opinion on things.  Because I'm so conflict-averse I tend to try to create a "educated" view which "balances" the views and facts involved; of course, this runs contrary to my true nature, which tends to create very "principled" / idealistic stances based upon generalized concepts I hold to be true.  As one might imagine, this internal contradiction can be extremely frustrating most of the time.  Ah well...c'est la vie de Mike.  Maybe things will change someday; maybe it will all just fall together and I'll wake up a happy person.  But I doubt it...
