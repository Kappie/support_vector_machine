I still have some unpacking to do but for the most part it is completed. I had a day off yesterday for the first time in a while. Zales was all super chaos, people quiting, getting sick and the rest. So I was called in to clean up. Fucking work ethics. Anyways, mimi and I went out to the Bay to Emryville to check out IKEA and fill out life with 'stuff.' Actually I was tired of working on my computer from a fucking stool and my lap. So we bought a table. We bought the table top and the legs and just built it. That was fun and it turned out to be exactly what we needed. I think we spent about an hour or two there trying to figure out what we were going to get. They have tons of super inexpensive stuff there. I was stoked. Emryville is a really cool town, all the buildings look like a cartoon.  After that we went out to Gilman St to eat at the Chipotle. Burrito! For the most part my days have been filled with putting things in their place. It's begining to look like home and I am so at peace with it all.  Another plus is a I am right down the Street from Sonoma State University and I swear, the only people that live in my new complex is SSU girls. Everywhere with their hoodies and pony tails. AHH! My eyes are going crazy. haha. Oh and I am getting DSL...woohoo. they are transfering the service so I am glad glad glad.   current mood:  satisfied current music: Millencolin - Monkey Boogie
