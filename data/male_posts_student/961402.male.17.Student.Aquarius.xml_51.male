Maps: The first three look the same at first glance, but on closer inspection I realize that Russia is a slightly different color of (red in the first map, green in the second and third) and China looks washed out in the third. The last map is just a bunch of various purples.  All three dot patterns in each row look identical.  The three ballon pictures look the same at first, but I can detect some sort of change in the left-most color of the foreground balloon (not the yellowish corner, but bellow and to the right of that), but I can't tell if any of them are red or green.  This could mean that I have double colorblindness. Boozor.
