At least I didn't get too attached. I mean this boi bought me a pair of Gucci sun glasses. These bitches are hot! I am still going to talk to him b/c he's a great guy. Just not a great guy to date. I really liked him too. But like I said, oh well. Not my lose. It's more like his. He doesn't know what he's missing. BTW: Thanx Jeremy and Danny for catching him. lol     Jayme your the best. You make me so happy. lol The way you randomly let me know that your horny. I am glad to be your fuck buddy. I would be honored. "He is suppose to come over tonight" I hope he does. He's so kewl.     My dad knows now about me and things are going great. He wishes I wasn't but he accepts. He was like "Son, you dont know what your missing out on. Girls are hot!" I was like yeah dad, girls are hot. But they are bitches. "Yeah they are bitches son but they are hot!" OMG!!!
