I think it has something to do with leaving the lights on when I sleep, weird dreams that mimick reality, daylight savings and oversleeping. I've just been really unsure of time.  Anyway apparently after disucssion with my professor, my paper's topic is more narrow. Basically more of an Althusserian / Anti-Althusserian analysis of the Motion Picture Patents Company and the judicial arm of the state.  **
