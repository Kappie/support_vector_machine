Jarrett finally brought Deus Ex over today. I really appreciate how he considers me just like him, not a little freshman, but a friend. We talked for about an hour about computers and stuff. Im probably going to be building a system with him this summer, which will be fun. Im kinda annoyed because I cant display 32bit colors when I have another monitor connected to this. Oh well, I would rather have one good quality screen than two crappy quality screens. Im also kind of annoyed because I cant seem to get my Deus Ex demo save games to the new saved games file. Oh well...Post again tommorow.
