You are not allowed to bounce it against anything, hit it with anything, or tie it to anything.    This one's  REALLY EASY .   Aristotle was famous for knowing everything. He taught that the brain exists merely to cool the blood and is not involved in the process of thinking. This is true only of certain persons.  (Will Cuppy)
