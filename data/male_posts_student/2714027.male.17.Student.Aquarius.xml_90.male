This time though, I'm more mentally prepared, although not quite so physically prepared. I have an  extremely  annoying coldsore on my lip, so I can't kiss anyone without passing an infection on to them (eww, I know). This calls for a little alteration of tactics, so tonight I'll say hi to her, but won't go chasing after her. I won't be made to look like a fool again, that's for sure. Expect a full debrief tomorrow, ha.   My camera arrived today as well and Blogger seems to have been updated, both of which are awesome :)
