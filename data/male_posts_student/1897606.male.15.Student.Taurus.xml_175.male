I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing, as I love people of all colors, but it is definitely a change from previous years. I mean, you couldn't go anywhere without seeing a guy with his pants down to his knees wearing a lame basketball jersey that says something witty like "GHETTO" or "PLAYA." Oh well. We shall overcome.  The coolest thing happened at Worlds of Fun, three times. On the Zulu, Cyclone Sam's, and the Ferris Wheel, everybody got into the whole Chappelle's Show "What, yeah, okay!" thing. You would think this would be old by now, but it's incredibly fun. Good times.  A good thing about the arrival of the black man at Worlds of Fun is the black kids. They're pretty cool. Ashlee dropped her quarter, and a black kid runs over to it and yells, "Somebody dropped their cents!" then promptly returned it to her. What a cool kid!  Spinning Dragons is an okay coaster. It looks pretty tame, and it kind of is, but it's fun and really smooth. Definitely worth a ride or two.  No DDR yet, they better get them in soon.
