Two more days of school left then it’s off for the summer.  Tonight is the relay for life thing and I’ll have to be up all night walking if no one shows up.  My English teacher is going to DJ for the one in Lowville, she rocks!    I guess this is going to be a short blog entry.... later all!  I ate your Web page. Forgive me. It was juicy And tart on my tongue.  Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons,  for you are crunchy and taste good with ketchup.
