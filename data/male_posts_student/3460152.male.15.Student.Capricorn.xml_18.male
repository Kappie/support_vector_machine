I usually hate Mondays because its the start of the week where a routine begins with school and all, but this Monday was different as I am off school for a week!  Not a lot happened really on Monday. I mean if you call 'going out' for a couple of hours something 'special' then I must admit that I did do something special, but in my eyes I didn't do a thing yesterday and was basically lazy :P  Yesterday was quite cool actually as I got to just 'chill' all day and did not have to bother with all things relating to school, but I must admit that I did do some coursework yesterday as these things don't just write by themselves you know! :)  All in all I suppose yesterday was an 'okay' day. Today I doubt that I will do anything special. I might go out with my mates but I doubt it as I am not in the mood to do so. Tomorrow I am going to see the new Harry Potter movie at the cinemas. I'll keep you posted with that!  Bye!  Stefan  P.S I will write about today (Tuesday) if I have anything exciting to tell!
