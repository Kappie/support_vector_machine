I calculated my pay, which at minimum wage($5.15/hr) at 45 hours should be $231.75 but that might be wrong because I'm too lazy to get up and look at the sheet that I wrote the correct pay on as it is in the other room. But it's about that.  For some reason I bet that I won't get pawed that much because last year I kinda got ripped off. Because the guy is my Dad's friend and all I really don't mind.
