These were two different, but very good exams, only slightly edited... Nope, not really tempted to go check those out.  I wish I was.  Sort of.  But I don't even remember the exam too well, and I was ok with my grade, and... no, I'm really not tempted at all.  But I do appreciate the opportunity.  Really.
