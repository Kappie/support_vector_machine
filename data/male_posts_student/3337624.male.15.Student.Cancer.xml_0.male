Another friend invited me to go somewhere and for some reason my dad said yes to that. SO i didnt get back until 10 where i promptly said goodnight, went to my room emptied my backpack, refilled it and left out the front door. Amazing how simple it was. Anyway the party was fun. There were 3 TVs set up with different Video games and we played magic alot. No shortage of food, drinks, or girls making out with eachother. Can't name names, but if you were there you knwo anyway, so HA. that'll teach you not to be inviited to parties. Anyway i left at 8:30 the next morning went in the GARAGE door, you know the really noisey one, went to my room and fell asleep. My parents did not even notice i had left. well that was a good time, which is why this post is labeled ROX instead of SUX, catch teh subtle change there? anyway SQUIRRELS RULE, and goodnight
