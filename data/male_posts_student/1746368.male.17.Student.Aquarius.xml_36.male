If you are expecting to see something that is interesting, you are expecting to much. My life is interesting, but probably not to many people. Maybe I should tell all of you a bit about me, that way you can possibly relate to me better or worse.   I am someone who trys to be dependable. I try to be loyal and I try to be a good friend. Now I am not one to judge if I am those things, you would have to ask my close friends and some of my family. Some of my hobbies include playing Classical piano, reading, playing video games and  trying  to have some kind of life.  I am a big computer nut and because of that I have been able to combine a few of my favorite things. If anybody cares to know, I do not like the Sound of Music, it just happened to work like that. I have a couple of websites that I plan on updating more often now that I have pretty much nothing to do. I will put both of the websites up at the end of this post. I also made a flash animation stick figure fight. It turned out pretty well and I got a lot of good feedback from it.   Well, I do not have much left to say. I will try and update this as often as I can. If you care to IM me please do I will leave a little bit of information at the bottom, but this will be the only post in which I do so.    urlLink Game Guides   urlLink Refined Reviews   E-Mail: sk8n4christ@hotmail.com AIM: nintendophreak20     *EDIT*  Well, I just saw Men In Black, the first one, for the first time ever. Yea, you guys may think I'm crazy. I fell asleep every other time I watched it. I only remember certain parts. I have seen the second one and everything. I don't know why everytime I tried watching it I fell asleep, but I didn't this time.   Mostly anyone who does not know me well and is reading this is probably wondering what I'm thinking. Well, maybe I'm mistaken, anybody who is reading this is probably wondering what I think of. I am actually very calm-minded. For the most part, I'm pretty sarcastic when I really want to be. I use sarcasim as a way to put things in perspective. People usually get upset at little things. I try not to, but I'm only human. I am pretty mild mannered about a lot of things. I will be as calm and rational as possible. Yesterday was a little different.  Last night I was feeling really sick. I do not know what was wrong with me. I had a terrible headache, a horrific stomache, I was sweating a lot, yet I was really cold. Now, I'm not one to usually get sick, and nothing was wrong with me emotionally or mentally (well mentally as far as I could tell). It did not stop for a long time afterwards. I went to bed at 12 this morning and didn't really go to sleep until sometime past 1. I haven't been feeling well this whole week.  Friday my next door neighbors left for Texas. They won't be back for quite a long time. I'm not even sure when they do come back. I thought, *Oh well, Dominique will still be here*. I don't have very many friends. Dominique and my neighbors are the people I spend most of my time with. Sine my neighbors are gone I figured that I would just get to spend more time with Dominique. She is leaving for a week long summer camp tomorrow. She gets back Friday and I won't have any sort of contact. When I found out I kind of lost a little bit of my mental stability. I have a whole week that I have nothing to do. Nobody to talk with, nobody to hang out with. Nobody to be myself with.  Dominique, I don't know if you are ever going to read this but I really miss you already. I hope you have a good time this week. Please don't change to much. I really like you and I hope that you feel the same way.  It's stupid that I even am like this. I left you for two weekends in a row and didn't go to youth one day, ending up missing three days I could have seen you. I'm really sorry and I know you are really sorry, but it's not your fault. Please don't feel bad, if it ends up ruining your week I am going to feel real guilty. I will miss you a lot.  Now that I have pretty much calmed down and let everything out, I better go in the bathroom and splash myself with cold water to hide the fact that I have been crying. This journal is seeming to serve the purpose I had for it. I am planning on using it to tell all of my friends how my life is going, but I am also using it for me to be able to unwind my day with and put everything down so it is not in my hands anymore. These will probably be short and long and everything in between depending on my mood. I don't know if there will be another entry today because I have pretty much drained enough.
