My sister also uses this one. There is lastly my old PC in my room which is currently being used by nobody.  The one in the family room is very old. Everything runs veeery slowly on it. This shouldn't be a hard issue.  Take the old PC in my room!   Of course, my dad decides instead to buy a new computer, without telling anyone. This kind of annoys me. I know he's the income of this family (though not the sole income anymore), but I feel like this is just a ridiculous waste of money and I'm not pleased with what he did.  Still, it's a very nice computer. It came free with a flat screen monitor (which are officially teh secks), and it plays Final Fantasy XI very nicel ^_^.
