But anyways, today some questions were raised (Thanks Chuckie) about my gender preferance. I assure you that I am straight. Although homosexuals are very fine people, and I get along with them fine, as Josh would put it "I don't swing that way". And people, you can give me dirty looks, laugh, giggle, gossip if you will about my open non-homophobia (not being sickened/afraid by gay people), Quite frankly scarlet, I don't give a damn. Just a post to clarify. The following do not make a person gay:  Cher (although she is "The Queen of the Gays" (another great quote from Chuckie)) Talking With Homosexuals Consorting With Homosexuals Caring about self-image, hygene, and body care (also known as metro-sexual, and no, that is not having sex with a subway or bus) (and on that note, I don't go for manicures, pedicures, spa days, etc....I shower every day, change every day, and always have clean laundry). The Song, "It's Raining Men" Cooking Baking Well, this list could go on, and lets get to the bottom line, and that is I am not homosexual.  Well, there was a good waste of a post. But if Chuckie ever reads this, I am not coming out of a closet, nor am I a closet. Also, my bosoms do not neet a closet for themselves. And a final note.....If I was gay I would openly admit it. I would not be ashamed. I applaud those gays who are open and free with their homosexuality.  And to Holly B, incase she ever reads, The Gay Court of Law is Now In Sessions, Will the Honourable Judge please flip the switches. FLIP THEM. NOW!!!!!!!!
