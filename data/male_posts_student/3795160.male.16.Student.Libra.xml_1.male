You see, this post of mine is very awkward for me. Mainly because today is the day I finally find out, after 3 months of torture, my final examination results.  You might think I'm over reacting but this is big stuff. If I fail this exam then the course of my entire future will be jeopardized. I'll have to think of a new future for myself according to my results. I could do the exam again but that would be wasting another two years. I guess I'll have to live with what I got.  I got terrible marks in the first half of the examination so everything now depends upon this result. If I cross 500, okay I might have a chance at a steady future but anything less would be a humiliation and it would be change my entire life.  Ok I guess that's enough sadness and emotional stuff for now. I have enough problems as it is with this exam and trying to remember my roll number, because that's the only way I can find out my result! The darn thing was like a telephone number! I remember 170###, the # is unknown! So I've got a lot of thinking to do.  Oh well I guess it's time for me sign out now. Until the next post, that is if anyone reads this crap, cheerio.
