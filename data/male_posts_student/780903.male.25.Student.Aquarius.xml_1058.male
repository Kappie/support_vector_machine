Nalebuff is also the co-founder of Honest Tea, which makes iced tea that isn't sickeningly sweet, and that I kind of like... and that I found cool when I first tried it and figured out it was the same guy who'd co-written the book I'd read.  The site's fascinating.  Just killed about a half hour of my afternoon reading.  The book has moved up on my list of things to read.
