Are they really so ignorant, or is it simply the nature of the liberal left?  Not that I was aware of such things back then, but I don't recall republicans clamoring for Clintons dripping heart when Nixon passed away.  If anything ultimately sways my political pendulum, it'll be asinine comments like this....
