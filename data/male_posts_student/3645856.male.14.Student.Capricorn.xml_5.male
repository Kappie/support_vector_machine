He spoke to the secret service agent standing guard and said, "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush." The secret service agent looked at the man and said, "Sir, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here." The old man said, "Okay, thank you sir" and walked away. The following day, the same man approached the White House and said to the same secret service agent, "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush." The secret service agent again told the man, "Sir, as I said yesterday, Mr. Bush is no longer president and no longer resides here." The man thanked him and, again, just walked away. The third day, the same man approached the White House and spoke to the very same secret service agent, saying "I would like to go in and meet with President Bush." The secret service agent, understandably agitated at this point, looked at the man and said, "Sir, this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to Mr. Bush!!! I've told you already that Mr. Bush is no longer the president and no longer resides here anymore. Don't you understand?!?!?!?" The old man looked at the secret service agent and said, "Oh, I understand. I just love hearing it." The secret service agent snapped to attention, saluted, and said, "See you tomorrow."  Well, i'm off to take a shower and get ready. I'm going to the bike shop in a bit and since i've been stealing my father's uncomfortable mountain/cruiser hybrid crossover bike, he's taking me to go get one... I haven't ridden a bike in like... two or three years until a couple days ago. I'm going to get a cruiser/road bike... since I ride on the backroads off of main street in the evening.. There's hardly any cars around and the temperature is always moderate and more comfortable in the evening/night... Well, i've spent enough time with with this post. I'm off.   Mood - Happy, hurried TV - TBS Music - That song wouldn't it be nice if we were older by the Beach Boys keeps playing over in my head, other than that, the last thing I listened to was someone's personal mp3s on soundclick.com  ~ George
