July 15 marked my one year anniversary -- I had meant to mark the occasion somehow, but in my head my one year of blogging started in August. Oops.   Anyway, I've scrapped Movable Type, my dear sweet web publishing system. The company that makes it stopped supporting free upgrades, essentially abandoning the community of users that made it so darned popular in the first place. They also closed the help forums for non-paying users. I could no longer get the help I needed as I was making site changes. Was more trouble than it was worth in the end. I'm using Blogger now. Unfortunately I can't (or can't figure out how to) import my MT entries. Rather than pretend they never existed, I've made them available for now and forever -- the old archives still look kinda screwed up though, I'll get around to fixing them eventually.   See the old site here:  urlLink grumblegrumble.ca/movabletypearchive/    And read the archives here:  urlLink grumblegrumble.ca/movabletypearchive/archives.html
