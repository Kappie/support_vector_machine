Anyways, I hung out with my buddy Amy, and my cousins and stuff so it was really cool. Saw lots of family and stuff. I didn't leave in a good mind though, I wasn't happy about some situations going on but I think I'm over it and stuff. I miss my friends Sharon, she's really cool... I like talking to her. Anyways, I like this girl though but I haven't seen her for a while so I dunno... but I really want to hang out with her soon. :when I was in canada I used my grandparents phoen a lot and I think I'll get into trouble when they get their bill: I really like the new Taking Back Sunday CD but I still like the old stuff better. I lost my CD though so I'm gonig to have to get it again somehow.       "Theres one thing I can do nothing about....." tbs      ~Tired of being lost.
