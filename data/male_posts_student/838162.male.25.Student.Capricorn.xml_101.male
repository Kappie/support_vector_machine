It’s been increasingly difficult to meet up with the people who run said station to discuss details. I would like to conduct it as soon as possible in order to circumvent the assignment deadlines and tests to study for that are pilling up this month. Oh well, at least I got permission to play songs by  Pension State  if I ever do get the gig. Thanks PS guys.     >    Right. I’m going to speak on a topic that would most likely alienate half of the people who read this (yes that’s the two of you). But I’ll try to bring it back onto something that would actually make sense to “normal” people.  Now everyone I know whom actually cares, have played and completed the hit PC game,  urlLink Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic . All the votes are in, the hype spread and the Game of the year awards handed out and yet I uninstalled it over the weekend to free up the huge amount of disk space that it takes up. Uninstalled that is, uncompleted.  Now this is not to say that I’m lazy in completing the games I play, I did pay $50+ for my copy of  urlLink SW:KOTOR  and I did complete  urlLink The Sands of Time . Instead, this about how although I find it a fantastic game with a fantastic story, it just didn’t capture the “spirit” of what I look for when it comes to  urlLink Star Wars .  I’m not one of those die hards that stick only to the movies in the face of all the extended material but I guess, for me,  urlLink Star Wars  is more about the characters and the actions that they did in the movies, than the whole   “universe with jedi and lightsabers and the Force”.   I would like to play/read something that not only is fully based in the  urlLink Star Wars  world as seen in the movies, but also has references to the main characters, their actions and even their future and history.  So in terms of the game  KOTOR , there are just too many things that seem different and even “break” the history that has already been establish during the movies. There are a few bright spots where they detail some history mentioned elsewhere but these are too few to hold my interest at least. I still stand by what everyone else is saying about how good it is, but while I don’t think I would be replaying it, I do have one request to the developer of the game. Give me a  urlLink Star Wars: NJO  game already and make sure there is interaction with the characters from the series and situations that took place.  Now how does all this geek goodness relate back to “normal” stuff? I guess it’s a call to take a closer look at your favorite books and television shows and perhaps play more attention to the stories and characters about why the writers make them the way they are and go through the things they do. It will be no longer a matter of who they are and what they do that is cool, but why they are that way and why do they do that that becomes the center. While it may take up more time and more interaction than normal, I’m pretty sure you will find your level of enjoyment of the series of books or show will increase. And if you’re already a fan, how can that be a bad thing?
