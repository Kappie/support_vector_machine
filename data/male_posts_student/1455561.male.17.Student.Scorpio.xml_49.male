My favourite is what people searched for to get to this website heres a few:  "lawsuite bill gates asthma" - yeah, windows crashing is enough to give anyone asthma.  "badger cianide pills" - !!!  honestly, this appeared in my stats.  i'm sure the RSPCA will deal with any badger infestations, theres no need to resort to fecking cianide.  How the hell are you going to give them the pills anyway? try and smuggle them into their food without them noticing? you havent thought this through.   CIANIDE! do you have any idea how unnecessary that is.  If you accidentally ingested some your heart would stop within 30 seconds. its like using a 50 megaton nuclear blast to light a cigarette.  "one ton cack"  - I would say this site was more than a ton of cack.  "mmcevoy blog" - worrying. someone actually tried to track me down.  "bournside school lost virginity" - *shudder* more alarming because the word "virginity" doesnt appear on my site.  Google just sort of assumed. bastards.  "jamie cullem jazz summer school" - i wouldnt bother.  "alexei sayle cack" - he is NOT cack  "crazed wolves in store a bad mistake, admits mothercare" - yep, i did type that  "cack am" - i hate the morning too.  "angry woman golfer clipart" - i think we've all been at that time in our lives when all we really want is a clipart pic of an angry female golfer.  "black forest cack" - i think you mean cake.  its not that hard to spell. honestly.   to think that all bar one of these people wanted to find something and they ended up with my site.  they must have been heartbroken.
