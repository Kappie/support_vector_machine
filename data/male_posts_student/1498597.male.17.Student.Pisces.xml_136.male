I mean, I did blog a bit  Friday  on the  Three Eye Witnesses , but those were little blogs that were sorta insignificant, that were only meant to inform the public of things to come and whatnot.  Well yeah anyway, lets get down to business.  On  Friday  at school, we had a  Renaissance Pep Rally .  If you don't know what a pep rally is, its somethin' like a...hmm...its the congregation (thats a nice, smart-soundin' word) of the members of our school (students and teachers) to cheer for some useless cause or to show support for one of our school's teams or somethin'.  Well, some pep rallies have themes, and this one's theme was the  Matrix , prolly in lieu of the recent release of the  Matrix: Reloaded .  Not only would hardcore fans consider the sorry emulation of the movie an insult, but it was just a bunch of shit and crap and more crap and a little more shit.  I guess you can at least aplaud their effort, although when you can consider how much of our tax money they spent on paper, lights, art supplies, and glowsticks and glow necklaces...well, there is a ton of stuff they coulda spent that cash on that would have been of use to the students.  That was just one of the stupid things the school did.  Another thing was that they commemorated all of those who got a "4.0 or higher",  Nick, Josh, Naoki, and Elizabeth  among them.  I think that its great that my friends are doin' good in school, but what about the other 1/2 of the students...or (lets face it) 3/4's?  We never have a rally honorin' them.  I know that it can be argued that they haven't worked to earn recognition...but they're human, just like the 4.0 crew and deserve the same things.  Or maybe this proves that these rallies are completely irrelevant.  Not only do they waste your time, but no one really cares at all.  I remember, at one time, I was one of those kids with the 4.0 and how I didn't really care that I was bein' recognized at all.  Yeah, they put your name on the wall with all the other smart kids, but who the fuck bothers readin' the damn thing?  You don't even really get recognized really.  They refer to you as "all the students who worked hard to get these grades", which further degrades the kids who didn't try hard  and  the kids who are bein' honored by reducin' the importance of individualality.  In the recent rally, there was a comparison of the school to the matrix, how it was a sorta of alternate dimension and a prison for those who reside in it and that the students who were "escaping"  or rather "the seniors who happened to get enough credits to graduate and get the hell outta this shithole and move on to yet another long, arduous period of studying, essays, tests, and stress" and how the only reason they were escapin' was that they made there own choices.  How can the school advertise "freedom of choice" when the students, who prolly would have been better off usin' that amount of time the rally took up to learn and improve their skills at somethin', were pretty much forced, in true Nazi opression-like fashion, to attend that waste of time piece of shit!?  What the hell is this crap they're doin' to us?  A form of brainwashin'?  What was the point?  Look at the contradictions!  Well, I dunno if bloggin' about this shit was worthwhile or not, but I hope whowever chooses to read this and try to scrape up whatever knowledge or meaning they can find in it takes it to heart and thinks about it.  For now, I leave you with no more words to say...expect:  More to come...!
