The novel, like other successful American Lit. novels, criticizes society through the experiences of a narrator that is a central character in the novel.  The Great Gatsby criticizes the "roaring twenties" by depicting the upper class' lifestyle that consists of breaking prohibition laws, having affairs, and murder.  Throughout the book I felt a sense of this lifestyle that I can only describe as "hollow."  That may not make sense, but it seemed to me as if the novel showed the upper class as not having a role in society, just partying and living a life that didn't have a significant meaning.    Going back to my thought on how this novel is successful due to its criticism of society, I can draw many similairities between this novel and Huckelberry Finn.  Both novels consisted of a central character that had the role of the narrator, both mocked society of the time period, and both novels a relationship between the narrator and another central character that grew as the novel progressed-both resulting in the parting of these two characters at the climax of the novel.    Maybe there are some other thoughts on this novel.....anyone?  -Pat
