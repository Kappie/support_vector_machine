Sarah and I were extremely tired from yesterdays activities.  We were so busy yesterday I didn't have to time to write about them so I will explain them now.  First we had to get up early for our jazz concert which went well.  Everyone though we sounded so good and we didn't even have the whole jazz band.  Our jazz band is hott!  Well after that we went to bay city so my brother and me could get fitted for our tux's for my sister's wedding.  Then we went to the music store and I bought my "trumpet bible".  The thing is huge and its filled with solos, duets and studies for trumept.  Its awesome.  After that we went to Walmart which is always intense.  Walmart is awesome, I don't know what America would do without it.  Well then we ended the trip with lunch at Fazolis.  We all got thier new pizza which was excellent.  Then we went home and Sarah and I decided to go up to Fairview for the Relief Sale, causally. It was alright.  We hung out with Hannah, Alecia, and her new cat.  Then Sarah and I had some awesome conversations on the ride home.  It was fun.  We watched Sleeping with the Enemy to end the night.  It was an intense day.
