Yesterday, I went to Escape Theme Park. Me and Ben met up first and went to Woodlands Interchange to meet up with the rest. Finally the whole group of 7 (me, Ben, XC, HM, EC, JiaHui and Melvin) gathered and we took the train towards Pasir Ris.    Opps, we took the wrong train. Instead of taking the train to Marina Bay, we took the Jurong East-bound train. Opps. On the train, we were talking and reading my 8 Days. Mostly, they were talking about the Star Awards Popular Artiste nominees (who will win and who will not).   After taking two trains and bus 354, we reached Escape Theme Park at around 1030. Hmm....we brought tickets and went in. Surprisingly, they did not give us arm bands to wear. That means cannot go out le. Darn.  Our first activity was the Go-Kart. HaHa! I was driving real slowly, not really that slow, but I was adjusting ma. HaHa. So scaredy-cat me. After that, we played this 3 other times. I sped really fast during these 3 times. HaHa! I even accelerated when going down the slope. I like car 19. XC and most people have trouble steering it (they crashed), but this car feels perfect to me. This got the "Most Exciting Award" from us.     After that, we played Pirate Ship. My first ride was real scary. Subsequent rides later, I felt very okay and enjoyed the rides. Wee!! During some of these rides, we would sing songs. We sang Riverside's and FuChun's school songs. Then, we moved on to nursery rhymes like "BaBa Black Sheep" and "London Bridge Is Faling Down". HeHe! After that, there was once we spilted, 4 ride one side of the ship, 3 the other. Then, we kept "You"ing each other. HaHa!! We gave this the "Ride That Brought The Children Our Of Us".   After the Pirate ship, we went to play the Panasonic Roller Coaster. It was kinda disappointing. I expected a much longer drop. Opf! We named this "Most Disappointing Award".   Then, they went onto the Cadbury Inverter. Only me, Mel and XC did not go sit that ride. Me and Mel were too afraid to go up that ride, but XC wanted to play it the last. Too bad he didn't get to play it, because that was the only time the group played the Inverter.  After that, we went on Wet And Wild, except for Mel. Me and XC were on a boat together. Woah! I was kinda soaked. XC decided to splash water on me, so I splashed back. HaHaHa! In the end, both of us were thoroughly soaked!  After that, it was more Pirate ship and Go-Kart rides to dry ourselves.  Then, lunch came. I spent about $6.40 ordering a Large Sprite and some bacon hamburger. Hmm! The drink turned out to be contaminated with a strand of hair, but i already gulped down a big portion of it. XC and Mel went to change it for me (I refused to change....drink so much already want me to change) and took the drink for themselves. HaHa.  Then, we played some slot games. XC won himself a soft toy (BumbleBear). Lucky him. The whole afternoon was spent playing Go-Kart and Pirate Ship rides. Haha! We left the Theme Park at around 5.50+. We went to Causeway Point to eat our dinner. I ate the sheng mian CQ likes to eat so much. So garlicky. As I was having a cold, I sneezed and some food was choked. My nose felt terribly blocked. Then, I sneezed multiple times and out came a stick of vegetable. How gross!   I came back feeling quite terrible. Ergh. Even with a cold, I watched Charmed. I will watch Charmed no matter what!  Today morning, I woke with a feeling much more better. Today was my Mother's off day, so the whole family is going out to Carrefour in Plaza Singapura. Except me, because WQ was coming to play.  Hm. I watched yesterday's recorded tapes in the morning. Oh god! Yesterday's episode of Holland V was so touching! I cried when SiTing and WanWan reconcilled. So touching! You know, Holland V's ending tomorrow. I can't bear to say goodbye to them! For 25 weeks, I have been watching this great show! This show provoked a lot of emotions from me, ranging from anger to love. Yeah! Can't bear to leave! I wonder who will WanWan choose. I hope they won't leave us a cliffhanger and said "To Be Continued". I hate that!!  This afternoon, WQ came lor. We played the Need For Speed, X-Men and Street Fighters. I won him in X-Men (duhz. Who can win my Phoenix?) and at Street Fighters at first. He mastered Chun Li's move (Kaikosen? Forgot the name) and kept using it. O.o! Hmm...no need to say in racing who won la. I sucks at the game.  After that, he ate noodles and played GunBound. Oh god! He was a team suicide player! He moved while he's firing weapons, causing several team members to be severly hit. Sigh!! After that leh, HE MESSED UP WITH MY RADIO! DO YOU KNOW HOW FREAKING HARD IT IS TO ADJUST BACK TO THE CORRECT STATION? F**K! I hate people playing with my radio. My perfect position. It stays where it is. NO ADJUSTMENTS UNLESS DONE BY ME! Guests coming to my home please take note of this important fact.  After that, I stayed home while the rest of the family ate dinner, due to nature calls. Sigh. WQ invited me to play 'badmintion'. However, I already promised XC to do the PAE thingy with him. Therefore, in the end, I am NOT playing 'badmintion'. Sigh. Got into yet another argment with WQ. He's so petty (must this be over-emphasized? I think the whole world knows. Or at least, those who reads my blog). He went on to blame me for something that is totally not connected to his issue. Sheez. Then, while I was typing my rebuttal, he went offline. HOW PETTY! He's so afraid of losing. I hate people cutting me off, and especially those who don't rebutt. Cowards!   Sorry for that crabby attitude. I am just too annoyed about the messing up of my radio.   I gotta be going liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog.
