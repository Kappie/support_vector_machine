I went online (and read) while waiting for Mother to come back. She returned at 10 with chee cheong fun. After eating, it was more online surfing. Meow moo!  Okay. At 11 something, I switched off my Internet connection and went to play my PS2 games brought yesterday. I know. A shocker. Kelvin stopped online surfing for the afternoon? Meow! Heh.   Anyway, I played Sonic Heroes first. Well, it was a very very difficult game. Seriously.Haiz. After an hour of non-stop dying, I don't wanna play anymore. I hope WQ has better luck with it. Heh.   At 1, I started playing my FFX. Woah! Woah! I love the game! It's so addictive! The storyline's great so far! There are much more FMVs then before, which is good. I noticed the bosses have gone harder, but oh well. The new Sphere Gird system is cool, but I haven't start customizing yet. Meow moo moo! The characters are so great! Wakka and Tidus are cute and nice. Rikku and Yuna are cute too, not to mention beautiful. Auron and LuLu are cool. Right now, my favorite character so far is LuLu. She's looks very very cool, got a beautiful face and her personality is so damn mature. Of course, my favorites in RPGs being mages contribute to LuLu being my favorite. I even changed my desktop picture from ViVi to LuLu. Heh heh! :)  Hmm. After that was not much. I went online at 5, then went to bath and ate dinner at 6 (went out to eat fried rice). When I came back, I went online. HaHa. I was kinda distracted, because I was reading debates in the MNI forums. Just now, my computer even froze on me, but luckily, I only written two paras, so it didn't really matter when I rewrote this blog.   Meow moo! I think I end here le. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
