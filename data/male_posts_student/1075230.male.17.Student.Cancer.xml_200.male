Ah, since no one seems to want to report on our nice little halloween party, I will ^^ ph34r my biased post >P   Surprisingly, my parents gave me permission to go to the party... i spent most of my morning doing paper route and checking out groups and wasting time on various games.    Then my dad came home, and I decided almost last minute to throw together a costume that i used for my last trick-or-treat thingie... in like... gr7. Oh, and that costume was also used for my criminology project, i believe. A simple detective-looking hat and trench ^^;;    Surprisingly, I was the 3rd person to arrive. And I arrived later than the 3:00 that was stated. Von and Mishi were already there... we played a bit of vids, then watched various shows that were not scary (even tho they're supposed to be). Jade came by, but left... Lynn, Keane, Aiza, and Victor came later, in that order, more or less.    By then, we were playing hide-and-seek outside, in the dark ^^ that, imo, was the funnest part of the day. Definitely something new, lol... but the people who saw us must've thought we were crazy >P   Around the time they started telling stories, I left (I'm usually first to leave ^^;; )    Anyhow, got no work done the next day (sat school + dragged to mississauga), nor the next (church + runescape + chatting). Well, Sunday was my fault, the others were unavoidable.    My brain is really messed from yesterday ^^;; so confused, umm... hoshi said i was giddy... i don't think so tho, lol... giddy's a funny word ^^   ~Chronos
