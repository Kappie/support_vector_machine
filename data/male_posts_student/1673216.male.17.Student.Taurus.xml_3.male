Yes my friends, -honor- classes. So the story begins during the last week of school. If memory serves me right (Yes I did go into mental shock after this and lost some of the memory) it goes something like this:  So, as was already aformentioned, this all took place during the last week of school. Or was it the last month? I'm sorry, but I am currently in therapy to block this memory out of my head. The last month of school however, was very warm and it was like any typical Las Vegas summer. So we are all sitting in Communications class, and apparently some people were not paying much attention. A girl, who shall remain nameless (Oh whatever, for your own safety, her name was Kenna) cranes her neck and peers out the large glass window. Meanwhile a gust wind outside is bringing cottenwood seeds up through the air as if thermals of hot wind are causing them to be airborn. Now, Kenna is looking out and sees small white things flying through the air in a quite uniform way. And what have we been taught since we were small children to associate white objects in the air as? Snow! So, loud enough so it sounds like she is broadcasting to the whole class, Kenna exclaims "Oh my god it's snowing outside! Look everyone!" I almost fall out of my chair in shock as I am thinking "No. It's Cottenwood. Sit down before I stab you." So someone says something similar to that. The only thing she has to say is "No I'm serious! Look!" And I slide out of my chair shaking my head noticing that several other people looked outside and considered believing her.  You Americans worry about your bank's being robbed... Beware! The unintelligent people  are  out there!
