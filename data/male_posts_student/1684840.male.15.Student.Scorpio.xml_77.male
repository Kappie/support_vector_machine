There was no Information Systems today due to this stupid thing about how well we did in SATs etc.  But hey, we got to miss Information Systems!  Chemistry was awesome!  We were making metal come from its ore, then Mrs. Bond made some metal explode >:D  Cooking wasn't so bad this week either.  I made Gingerbread, which turned out like Ginger cake!  Thatnks alot Mrs. Humpherys for taking it out too soon *rolls eyes*, the middle wasn't cooked properly!  Anywho, the rest of the day went alright.  I earnt a tenner off Aunty Di for installing and setting up some stuff on her new PC.  Pretty cool really!  I'm off now, cya :)
