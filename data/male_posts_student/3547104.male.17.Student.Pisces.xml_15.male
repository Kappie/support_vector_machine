I think I'm gonig to Massachusetts next weekend for a family reunion type thing. And I just recently bought a cell phone (FINALLY)... the number is 206-0767, for all of you nosey folks.  I def just got back from an evening out on the town with Loose and Dijana. I was the only person in this threesome without a huuuuuuuge rack. Oh well. We went to see Anchorman (GO F**K YOURSELF SAN DIEGO), and went to dinner at Friendly's (FORGET THE MUNCHIE MANIA... I'LL HAve SOME OF THAT!!!)  My deepest apologies to Sophia and Colleen as I was not able to join them in this evening's festivities in celebration of Marisa's birthday (I THINK). I'm extremely tired, so I think I'll stop typing now.      ...love, love me do. You know I love you. So pleeeeeeeeeease...  love me do .
