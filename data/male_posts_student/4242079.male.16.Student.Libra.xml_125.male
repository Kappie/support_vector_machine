I think I can handle another 15-25 hours a week. It's not like I have anywhere important to be. I never go anywhere important like Calgary or Edmonton. I don't really have any relationships that require a huge amount of maintenance. I think I'm going to apply at the Bay. It'd be swell to have two jobs in the same mall...so convenient. If not there, then something on the southside.
