(Well me at least!)  So anyway, whats Sophies Quest? Sophies Quest is an RPG which is being produced by a small team from around the world; although most of us are based here, in merry old England! We have programmers (like me :) graphic designers and graphic co-ordinators (like pals Lewis and Hazel AKA "Fraz"), music composers (hello Tom :) and Quality Assurance personnel, media management and so on. But thats not what you want to see is it? No..not at all  This blog is for the team to post up what they like, when they like; how they like. Over the course of the project, you'll see source code, ideas, plans, debates from the team and sneak previews. But you'll also get totally unrelated news, such as the story on how I went out and got drunk, forgetting I had to attend a team meeting later that night......  But anyway, enough of me rabbiting on! Have fun, bookmark this blog (shakes fist "bookmark it!!") and if you want to ask questions,feel free to leave comments  l8rs! Seano
