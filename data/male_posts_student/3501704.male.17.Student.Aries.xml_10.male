I couldnt contact my friend who suddenly seemed to have dissappeared, calling his phone and his house got no reply... oh well, anyway saw some of the scouts having a debrief after camp, kind of reminds me of my younger days. Time really passes so fast whether u like it or not, maybe when i grow up i will invent a time machine or something.  Oh yeah i found out that some simple msgs can have a lot of meaning, in a positive sense that is, it allows u to keep in contact with some ppl who are in other schools and lets u noe how they are doing. The power of words can really make a difference, kind words bring joy to ones soul while hurtful words bring sorrow. Oh yeah i tried to do some excercise in the evening, man i sure need to excercise more regurlarily, jogging for a while makes me tired already..  Thats all my mind can think of for now
