I think i also didn't play a good role at the begining to help them but i am just trying to saverage Peer Support as much as i can. Year End camp seems to be months away but time flies by so fast that the next moment i know i will be conducting the last camp in secondary school. Don't really want to put the meetings on a saturday because Atrina is around. *sigh* but i got no choice as many of them cannot make it on weekdays even myself thus i have to put it on saturday. Next week is the last meeting and also last Peer Support Program for the Sec 1. I can only be there early in the morning to make sure the Sec 2 and 3 are in proper attitude and so on and so for. After my E-maths mock test i will have a meeting with them till don't know what time also.   I saw her today conducting Red Cross but when i look away and walked away from the area, my heart ache and memory return. I can't forget her, i want to but i just can't. What is this? Torture to me? I don't know. But I swear that i will have nothing with the school unless necessary. I told my old friends if being a god-brother is a good idea, they don't agree that i should. Somehow i cannot be a god-brother to some people, i don't know why? I prefer to be friends with them instead. Havn't been so active online since holiday until now. I just hate the thought of seeing her nick or even have the mood to chat with anybody online in some sense. Steve and melvin are the only 2 person that i have been chatting with when i am online early in the morning and after that i won't be online at all. I think i would need to practice more and read more english. It sucks a lot but at least i am able to pronunce it properly and clearly, that was something good but there is still room for improvement. 'O' level is drawing near, but some how my mind still can't let go of her!! why!! I tried all ways but none works. It hurts further more. *sigh* *sigh*
