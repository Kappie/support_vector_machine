He was, and i stayed there the night. Benny showed up, but left.....i needed last night, so thanx fella's.  Today, or more, RIGHT NOW, i'm heading over to Somers to go work on my car with my dad.  I HAVE to talk to Lilia though, cause it's been like 3 days, and i feel like an asshole, so yeah.  I'll be back eventually...call my dad's cell phone if u want to know whats up. (224-9890)....ya, seeya...
