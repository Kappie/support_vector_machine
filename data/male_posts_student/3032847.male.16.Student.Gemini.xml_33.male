I spent last week at me nana n grandads 'cos me mam n dad were on holiday. I've been out practically every day for the last fortnight, with mates or down the town for a walk about and, the general randomness that sometimes occurs. On the saturday night (my last night down there) I was wanting to stay over at lukes, he had alcohol and his mam n dad were away too. But me nana said she didn't want me to for some reason, (my grandad has no say in things when she's concerned lmao), and I didn't want to argue or present any 'back-chat' like some cheeky young laddy...    This week, I've been out and about every day (apart from today) also. Yeah, filling the time with random trips to here and there, like yesterday we went to the beach- it must have been the hottest day of the year (about 22-24 degrees C :-O) so, in our infinate wisdom, we had a fire. And climed up some sand dunes. And generally made the problem of being miles too hot and weary a lot worse than it deserved to be. And it never rained today. And it only rained yesterday in the evening. The wind sometimes has a warm feel. Summers here! (probably)    So I'm off now, to disappear into the dark. Theres some kind of emergancy down at the hospital, some fire has knocked the power out and they only have 24 hours of stand-by charge or something. My mams on standby incase it fails and all the machines that go bleep and stuff stop working (being a nurse, like she is) so I better free up the phone line...    Good Night England!
