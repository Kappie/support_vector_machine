Well I guess this is growing up for him!) - Dammit... Or... ( Ur daddys panty line has been wearing thin, his diaper has been tight since the day he PISSED IN THEM!) - Hit or miss... or ( If you see Piss Pants, he makes me sick ,preschool's over, and he smells like shit) - if u see jordan... or ( If you could be my daddy piss pants, i could be ur daddy piss pants too, you can tell me how u just pissed ur pants, and how ull do it again) - Punk Rock Princess... lol ... also coming soon , The Dyking Soundtrack, featuring cheesy disco ham like Staying Alive - the Beejees. yeah anyways, where was i ... oh ya... we were playing in the snow and taking pictures and i did about 3 dives face first into the snow, 2 feeble attempts at ninja rolls, one horrible summer sault, another attempt at a flip , a bad try at a cart wheel , and i tried to help kayla do a handstand, which ended up in a two person dog pile and me getting my ass scratched by a picnic table.  We also had  a two person pyramid and i rode kayla down a snow bank like a SLED. Good times... anyways, Snakes a chink. And dance dance bat man is wicked. Also... we had a vicious dodge ball game against the boys today where Volleyballs should be conidered lethal weapons and only the retardedly lucky survive. Snake was probably partying with all the dancing bums on earth and i was at school getting balls whipped at me by the white men. That made me so mad.
