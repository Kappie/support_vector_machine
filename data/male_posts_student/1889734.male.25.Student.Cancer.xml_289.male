You can't read the entire article here, but you get the drift when you get to this paragraph.  "While there is no doubt that counterfeit and adulterated medicines?some potentially injurious, possibly even lethal?are sold over the Internet by unscrupulous vendors, a TIME investigation suggests the FDA's actions against Canadian imports have been part of a concerted campaign to simultaneously discredit its counterpart agency in Canada, provoke fear among American consumers who buy their drugs there, blunt an exploding political movement among local and state governments to begin wholesale drug buys in Canada and ultimately preserve the inflated prices charged U.S. consumers and taxpayers. "  Inflated prices?  Yes, it seems that Time concludes that Big Drug is gouging the American consumer.  It seems that we are striving to prevent the flow of drugs from Canada to the US, never mind the fact that we ship them to Canada in the first place.  I guess the Times discovered those vast groves of Lipitor trees growing free and wild all over the Canadian tundra, while Canadian citizens freely wander among the boughs, plucking the medication from the trees while John Lennon's 'Imagine' plays softly in the background.  Bah!
