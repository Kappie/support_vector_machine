Part of my fear of the future is the fear of lost semesters; life becoming a continuous grind, where May turns into June, into July, and August, and soon September is here, and it's no different than May, except maybe shelling out some cash for a package vacation.     Last summer, most likely the best summer.of.my.life., I was unsure whether or not I could call this post-May determination a Summer Break.  Break from what?  I have nothing on the agenda, an open dance card and nary a partner to waltz with.  What is this break from?    An unanswerable question.  As all good questions are.    Looking over the wake of my 2003 sojurn, I see a wide-eyed 23 year old, able to spread his wings because I couldn't fall; there was another year of safety net for me to fall on.  I don't feel that.  yet.  And I really need to.  I'm good when I'm inspired.  I sleep less, I do more, I'm more fun, I'm more fit, I have more to say, I have more to offer.    The last few weeks have been enjoyable; beers with a lot of folks, saying goodbye to new friends who are now old friends, meeting newer friends who I wish I had more time with, and the past two days, organizing myself for the chapter ahead.    But the energy isn't there.  And the writing...shit.  The writing is stalled out.  Doubt festers.  Kernels of inspiration pop, but are quickly consumed, leaving a dearth of sterile seed.  I cannot forget Bob Foshko's honest moment with me in 2002, where he told me of his own writing folly, and how the inability to produce work he could be proud of cost him a career.  I often feel that way.    I am supposed to leave now.  I will be late.  Can I make the time up?
