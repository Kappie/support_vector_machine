There are more of you out there. I bet not a damn on of you can give me a good, honest reason why. Anything that you can say to show me that linkin park is a bad band, I can turn right back around on you. Here's just a few examples:                         #1- LP sux because they set a bad example for our children w/ their bad words and hateful words.                                                                                         reply- y single them out? If they don't learn this stuff from a song they WILL learn this stuff from other places. And what about them is hateful? Excuse me, but is there not a war going on right now? Aren't there hate crimes going on?  Where do you think they will learn hate from? Not from these things and not from a band that they may not even understand the lyrics to.                                                                                         #2- they are only a good band because they are on MTV                                                                                         reply- You could say that for any band or artist dumbass!!!!!!    like I said, just give me a reason and I WILL reverse it! That is a guarentee. I cannot believe that some of you LP haters can bag on linkin park, yet like manufactured pop. Now don't think I am a hypocrate for saying that a certain type of music is bad. I unlike you freakin' LP haters DO have reasons for hating the songs.You want to say that linkin park sets a bad example, How about saying that britney spears sets a bad example? Have you seen a few of those outfits she has worn? This is what the nations girls idolise. An impossible image like that will make any girl want to diet, vomit after eating, and work out like a gym junkie. so shove THAT up you're ass!!!!!!!!!!!
