Anyway, I'd love to see GWB taken to the cleaners, but if there is a win, it will be by a slim margin; too bad, nothing would please me more than seeing GWB and his right wing cronies get taken to the cleaners and see a decent centre left block emerge in the US which has the balls to crush the voice of the extreme religious right by ensuring that there is a decent education system which would stave the religious right of blind ignorant followers who drool over GWB like straight men looking at a porno with Jemma Jameson.
