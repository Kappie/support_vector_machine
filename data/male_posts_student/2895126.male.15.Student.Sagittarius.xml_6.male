I thought I was done with that stuff when I got out of Assumption (where I attended elementary and middle school), but it seems that my educators still insist on embarrassing me in front of everyone else. I was very uncreative; I, being my normal rebellious self, wore normal clothes and two different shoes.  Shaun Lally, however (who has again requested a mention in the blog), wore his sister's shirt, constructed some Kleenex... uh, "breasts," and wore some other rather transvestite items. Well done, Shaun.  Quote of the Day  It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.  (Aristotle)
