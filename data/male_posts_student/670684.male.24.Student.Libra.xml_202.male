Yes, I play online games.  Just this one, and not too often, but some old HS friends play it and we have fun doing it.  Anyway, I figured I'd log on for an hour or so, get my character up to Level 30 (if you don't understand leveling, I'm not going to try to explain right now), mem spells, and get a bub or two into 30 so I wouldn't need worry about dying and going back to 29.    It started out fine, got 30, got spells.  Practicing them, I got assaulted by a goblin; I had him down, but as he was walking away, he stopped right next to two large giants.  Had I fought there, the giants would have smoked me.  So I tried to cast on the gobby, but I ran out of mana.  It was up to my pet to get this gobby from 3% down to 0%.  The gobby was casting spells on me, weakening me.  The gobby was at 1% when he killed me.  So, I went on a corpse run, got a rez, got back, hit 30 again, and as I was meming the new spells, I got another mob on me.  I tried fighting it, but I didn't have my buffs or anything memorized, so I started shouting help.  The group next to me failed to help, and I died.  For the second time.  So I got a KEI (really good buff for casters) and made the corpse run back to Frontier Mountains.  The corpse run is about 20 minutes or so, not fun.  As soon as I got to my body, a goblin was there to wipe my ass.  I killed him, but only after he had cast malaise on me, a Death over Time spell.  There were no healers in the zone (only three folks around), so I died once again.  For the third time.    Notice I didn't hit 30 the last two times.  WHen you die, you lose experience that moves you to levels.  I started the day 3% away from 30.  I ended it 17% away.  I got my body, gave Cazic-Thule the finger, and was out.  It'll be a while before I touch Chinua again.
