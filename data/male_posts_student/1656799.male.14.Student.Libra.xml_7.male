We're going to extra time and I have a bad feeling we're going to end up with a penalty shootout. I'm staying rather confident that Swindon can go through.  EDIT - Just as I posted this Rory Fallon scored for Swindon. 2-1 on aggregate to the reds! Going up!  EDIT2 - Brighton scored with ten seconds to go ... I have a bad feeling about this.  EDIT3 - Bad feeling was correct, Brighton managed to win in the penalty shootout 4-3. Swindon will not go to the playoff final now and their season has finished. :( Lets just hope I do have a good day on Saturday, I'm hoping Millwall beat Manchester United.
