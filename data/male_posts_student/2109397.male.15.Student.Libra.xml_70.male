I saw Arry Pottah (Harry Potter for those of you who dont understand a good british accent). It was the best of the movies by far, but that might be because the books get better as they go along as well. They did however leave out a somewhat big part, although it didn't affect anything important. I'm going to ruin it for the 3 of you who actually read this. They left out the whole Quidditch Cup win, which IMO was a big part because it was the only like happy part in the movie/book, and in all the other books and movies the quidditch never finished. With the new director there was a couple of differences as far as the set,scenery, which bugged me at times but it wasn't anything major. I thought the movie was going to suck but I enjoyed it thouroughly.   Im goin to play footy tomoro finally although I have already played this summer. It shall be fun. We're going over to Sweeney's house after we get finished and we r going to watch good movies. Kelly has this thing at blockbuster where she gets 3 movies at a time anytime for 30 dollars a month. Tell me thats not kool. We're watchin 28 Days Later supposedly, which will be itme number 7 but I dont mind because it RULES. Kelly hasnt seen The Shining and she calls herself a movie buff. PFFFF, I spit at that.
