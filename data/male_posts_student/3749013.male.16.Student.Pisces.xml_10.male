While the whole class next door was 'showering' (friend T), I popped in and joined in the fun. When she offered to refill the water bottles, I was still crazily laughing at (friend T)'s plight. When I found out that she had gone refilling the water bottles, I realised that I've missed another opportunity to get close to her one on one, crap... When she returned, she offer her water bottle for me to pour... I was stunned, but I accepted her offer, thankfully... Then, I had to leave for lessons, damn that Fong...  The 2nd meeting was when everything was finished for me in school... I waited with (friend K) in the library for her class to dismiss from Fong's lesson... I've got excuses of my own then, claiming that I was waiting for (friend C) and (friend T) to go for our A-maths tuition. I have, of course, the intention to catch a glimspe of her before leaving for tuition. But those two a**holes screwed up my plan, made me wait for them for a whole 2 hours, and we've got to postpone our lesson till tomorrow. Yet I saw her with her group of friends outside the G room waiting for her friends who were still taking their test. Luckily, I still had (friend K) to accompany me, if not, I'd be the odd one out there... All of you guys reading this blog should know, by now, that I'd feel bloody awkward when I in facing a group of girls, so I decided to leave those two a**holes in their test and go home.  As I'm pretty drained by today's activities, I planned to take the bus home, little did I expect what was waiting for me at the bus stop. When I was approaching the bus stop, I saw a familiar figure at the bus stop. IT WAS HER!!! FINALLY MY CHANCE WAS HERE!!!, but I also saw her friend beside her when I got closer... When I wanted to sit down, that bloody bus, which doesn't appear so readily, appeared at that bloody moment... I can't seem to find an excuse to remain at the bus stop at that split moment, so, without a choice, I boarded the bus. But before I board, I shouted:"bye bye!!!". They replied, of course. But what I did not expect was her to shout an exceptionally loud:" BYE BYE!!!". When I boarded the bus, my heart pumped faster, thinking about the BYE BYE she shouted earlier... Should I be happy? I don't know. I just want to sue SBS for their stupid service... It's the same bloody bus I took wrong the other day while going to (friend C)'s house...
