She has her own special name for me - "Soft Hands". Self-explanitory. Though I suppose it is a matter of opinion. And she enjoys the rain to the same degree I do. She also frequents Java Cabana, the coffee shop.  Morgan - younger sister of Alanna, who joins the DOY poetry circle with her extreme randomness that I envy. I wish that I could mimic her extremely random thoughts, for I find them quite hysterical. Experience her on DOY. (see the link) And, by the way, she enjoys Saltine crackers and does not enjoy potatoes. And she is an actress and movie producer. Alanna will often touch up the films for a good performance.  Laylee - a photographer who is quite talented, who often includes Becca in her pictures. She too is in on the DOY poetry circle. Laylee is quite a charming young lady, and she is extroverted and fun to be around. I regret not knowing more about her.  Johnna - another friend I met through Elise. She lives quite a ways away in, I believe, Collierville, and she also is quite a charming young lady. I joined with Johnna to observe fireworks on the fourth of July. That was quite exciting.  Arthur - a fellow DOY posting poet who lives far away in I forget where - New Hampshire. He is a cool dude, if you will excuse my obsolete speech, and he is past the malicious high school experience. He is currently out of hell, and I believe he shall proceed to college. He is also a musician, like myself!  Cheers, my fellow mortals.
