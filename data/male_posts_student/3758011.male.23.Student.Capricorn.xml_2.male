Companies set limits to the amount of stock that employees can buy, which is usually related to the wage or salary earned by the employees or it may be restricted to above certain wage levels. There may be certain conditions with regard to the resale of the stock also - such as agreeing to sell to the issuing company first until a stated period or until he is no longer with the firm. The cost of shares is usually deducted from the pay at source. Sometimes, the worker's share of profits is utilized to pay for the stock purchases. This method of profit sharing is usually applied only to managerial and executive personnel to avoid dealing with vast numbers. This method of profit sharing comes with its own merits and demerits. They merits are: 	Links compensation package closely to performance. 	Offers a way for an organization to retain the best of the employees. 	Motivates recipients to perform even better. 	Inculcates a sense of ownership and responsibility. 	Establishes importance of team effort among employees. The demerits associated with the scheme are: 	Only profitable companies can use the tool. 	Stock prices do not always reflect fundamentals of an organization. 	Falling share price could mean losses for employees 	The inability to cash in quickly can dampen the interest. 	Lack of transparency can earn accusations of favoritism. Inspite of the above associated demerits, this option is being increasingly used by companies to command loyalty in industries marked with high managerial mobility as the scheme links a manager's reward to his efficiency. Kinds of ownership The option of providing an employee with this benefit is done in two ways: Employee Stock Options A stock option is a right issued by a corporation to an individual or an entity to buy a given amount of shares of company stock at a stated price within a specified period of time. Employee stock options are options issued to employees as a form of incentive compensation. A stock option gives an employee the right to purchase a set amount of shares at a fixed price for some years into the future. Generally speaking, the rules for who gets options and how much they get are much looser than for ESOPs. In the past, companies usually gave stock options only to "key" employees. Nowadays, more and more companies give options to most or all employees. There are two main types of stock options. 1. Incentive stock options (ISOs) They must satisfy the conditions of the Internal Revenue Code for preferential tax treatment. An ISO generally allows the employee to defer taxation until the date the shares bought with the option are sold and to pay tax at the applicable capital gains tax rate rather than the (higher) ordinary income tax rates. The company does not get a tax deduction.  2.  Nonqualified stock options (NSOs) They are options that do not satisfy the Internal Revenue Code's conditions for preferential tax treatment. When the employee "exercises" the option by buying the stock, he or she pays ordinary income tax on the "spread" between the value of the stock and the price paid for it. However, the company receives a tax deduction on the spread. Unlike ISOs, NSOs can be given to non-employees.  3. Phantom stock This is another kind of stock option. This is a bonus that rewards employees based on the increase in value of the company's stock, the dividend performance of the stock, or both.  4. Stock appreciation rights (SARs) They are similar, and in effect consist of phantom stock without phantom dividends. Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), are retirement plans in which a trust funded by the employer owns company stock and employees cash out after they leave. The ESOP is the most tax-advantaged mechanism for companies to share ownership with employees. An ESOP is an employee benefit plan operating through a trust that accepts tax-deductible contributions from the company to accumulate company stock, which is then allocated to accounts for individual participants. The ESOP can acquire both new and existing stock. The trust can borrow money to purchase the stock, with the company repaying the loan by making tax-deductible contributions to the ESOP. ESOPs can be used for a variety of purposes, such as: Broadly most companies follow two models. A. Beneficial ownership Under this scheme, the company allocates a number of shares to an employee at a price, which is the 52-week average of the market price. This generally comes at a 10 to 15 percent discount over the market value. The shares are, however, held by a trust. The employee has rights over the shares only after a lock-in period of one year. After 12 months, most companies allow the employees to either sell 25 percent of their shares and pocket the difference or the employees can buy those shares from the trust at the price quoted when the shares were first allocated. Or else the trust continues. Such schemes generally extend over a period of five years. Each year, a certain percentage of shares is freed up for employees to exercise their options which are three: sell, buy or instruct the trust to hold them. At the end of the five-year term, the employee will have to either offload all the shares or buy them from the company at the original price. If the employee resigns before the one-year lock-in period, the employee forfeits all the shares. If he resigns after one year, he can exercise his option of selling or buying 25 percent of the shares. Similarly, after two years there are other alternatives and so on and so forth. Most companies do not allow the employees who have left them to hold such shares beyond five years. They have to sell them back to the trust at a price that is an average of the eight preceding weeks. 5. Shadow ownership This second scheme is offered by multinationals in India. Under this scheme, staffs are allocated shares of the parent company which may be listed abroad-- usually Wall Street or the London Stock Exchange. But here, the stocks are never transferred in your name because Indians are not allowed to hold foreign stocks in their name.
