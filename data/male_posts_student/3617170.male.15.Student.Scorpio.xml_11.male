Unless, of course, some guy with a flamethrower decided to chase me down. Then I'd be screwed.  Since I stopped writing, I picked up an Xbox. Most of the games are lots of fun, and online play over Live is a LOT better then with PCs, thanks to the voice capabilities, which allow for easily coordinated teamwork. I'm mostly playing Rainbow Six, so if you want to play me (and probably kick my ass), my GamerTag is RecklessSoldier. I've also been playing  Full Spectrum Warrior,  and it's actually pretty cool. I wrote up a review that can be found  urlLink here.   Anyone ever notice how goddamn hard it is to open one of those plastic "blister packs?" If you haven't, well, it's goddamn hard! They should use that material to make nuclear fallout shelters or protect soldiers or something. You need a freakin blowtorch to get through these things.
