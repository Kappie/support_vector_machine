Initially, me and my friends thought of going a western country but in the end, we went to Malacca and have fun at A'Famosa WaterWorld Theme Park at Alor Gajah (a place in M'sia). Aniwae all of you should try to make a trip there as it is much better than the one Singapore have at Pasir Ris Wild Wild Wet and East Coast Big Splash! Btw here are some of the pictures I took at the Water World Theme Park.         Family Raft Slide          The dinghy          Nerve-racking High-Speed Slide          Me doing the slide          Body Slide          Me and my gang(all attached already)    So who knows one day we might go there together?Any takers???
