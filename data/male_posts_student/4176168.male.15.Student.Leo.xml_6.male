I was watching the olympics...and I see China have done well in synchronized diving 10m platform for Women...I'm glad...I predict that the Chinese will also do very well in bedminton, and table tennis...they always do...well...I wish them luck...maybe I should be saying that to the Canadian team? ;)  The handbook is still missing a cover...tomorow will be my last chance...and also my deadline...and this is one deadline I intend to keep, time is running short for everyone...so I can't afford to screw up now...not that I will...I already have a idea of what I will do, just need to run it through my team and we should be done in less than 10 minutes, wish me luck.
