Coming in about a week or two, you will be able to enter the "bagel.tech Gmail Invite Giveaway."  I'm going to be getting some invites in a couple weeks for my Gmail account, and I'm keeping one for myself (I'm using the account I have now temporarily), and I should have like 3 to give out.  Get ready for it, and be sure to keep checking out bagel.tech, because it could happen at any time.  But, on to today's site of the day.  So I got the email, I went and signed up, and I was already impressed.  I tried sending a test email, and within seconds, it was already gone.  Wow.  The main thing that's great about Gmail is that you get 1 gigabyte of space.  That's about 10x more than Yahoo, and about 4x as more as the new Hotmail, which is launching in a few months.  Gmail has a nice interface, and it's fun to work with.  The only gripe about Gmail that I can find is the fact that they scan through your emails and give you text-based ads.  Not so cool.  But, once you get past the fact that they will never give out any information you send in an email, you'll realize that it isn't bad.  They're giving you a gigabyte of space, so the least you could do is let them put a couple ads.    Gmail has a nice interface, like I said above.  It's different from most email programs, in the sense that you can view things in conversation view, it's a clean interface, and, let's not forget, this thing is fast.  It reminds me of an early version of Hotmail or something.  It could be better, but, it's still nice the way it is.    Gmail is FAST.  It takes like 1/2 a second to send an email.  It's awesome that way.  You can go in, type the name of the contact (or select it from your contact list), type your email, hit send, and even on the slowest connections, it should go away quickly.  It's really nice.   urlLink    Gmail has a conversation view mode, so you can view all the messages in a chain of emails at the same time. urlLink     Even though its still in beta, and changes are likely to come to it, Gmail is one of the most powerful free email tools on this planet, and, if you happen to get an invite, be sure to take advantage of it.  With 1 whole gigabyte of space, you can't go wrong.  Gmail gets the rare score of  6 out of 5.   Remember to keep checking back, because as soon as the contest starts, there's only going to be like 3 invites available.  Look for the "bagel.tech GMAIL INVITE GIVEAWAY: GOING ON NOW!" At the top of the page, where the profile bar is.  When you see that, Gmail me at the address given to enter to win.  The contest will last three days, or one day for every invite that I get.  After you email me, I'll put all the entries together, and pick one out every day.  Whoever wins, gets it.  So, look out for it, because its coming at a time when I don't know of yet!
