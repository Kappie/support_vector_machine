"How can a facility weigh the ethical considerations of upgrading technology and replacing human workers with mechanic workers?"  This topic is of great interest to me because I believe in facilities maximizing their technology to better serve the public's as well as their own needs.  Technology can effectively replace many of the functions of human workers.  The dilemma is whether reducing human workers is better in terms of quality and efficiency.  In some cases, yes, a computer can do a more thorough job with less mistakes than a person.  The computer doesn't get tired and doesn't make mistakes.  This, on the surface, sounds great.  However, computers cannot make decisions for themselves.  They are only as good as the people that programmed and use them.  I for one believe that computers should be used by companies not to replace whole departments, such as billing or medical records, but to enhance the abilities of a few more highly trained individuals.  The goal should be streamlining.  This cannot be done without human interaction.  Technology should allow facilities to cut back on the number of support staff that they need.  This will demand a more highly trained and flexible staff.  However, the technology will reduce the amount of repetition and reduce wasted materials.  The benefits of technology are endless, however, humans will always need to be an integral part of the process no matter what it is.  Technology should be used as a tool not a crutch.  Marrying the idea of a technologically advanced health delivery facility with skilled and properly trained staff will solve this dilemma once and for all.  Any other opinions would be appreciated.
