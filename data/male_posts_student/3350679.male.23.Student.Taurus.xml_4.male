Got 3 more DVDs for my expanding colection Colatoral damage, outbreak and empire records have not seen colatoral damage yet but the other 2 are classics.  Also got the fallout collection cheaply fallout was a game that I played for hours in second years in university and am looking forward to getting back into it.  Collection also had fallout tactics and fallout 2 so I will be playing them a lot to   Any way that i snough for now   cu later
