XC smsed me at 8, with intentions to wake me up. XC must realize that I only switch on my handphone after I bathed, which by then, would be useless to send me wake up SMSes. :P I chatted and meowed online lor. I got so many things to do! Oh yes. Even ducks must come up with a list of ranks for their own Departments.   Anyhoo, I cooked instant noodles for lunch and meowed at it. Hmm, I was chatting wtih Prof Snapeluva when she said there's a chat transcript of JK's chat. Oh my my. She revealed a lot, didn't she? HaHa. Harry's not gonna die and there's no such thing as Hermione and Draco being together. How meowful!! Meow moo meow!  Hmmm. At 1, I met CQ. We are going to buy WQ's present. Hmm. I orignally lied to WQ that I was playing FFX. Oh well. I can't say where did we go, or else it would be too obvious what the present is. We brought the prezzie. I paid for the prezzie first, so the rest owe me some meowing money. Hmm. I am also bringing the present back home. It's such a mooing view. After prezzie buying, CQ went to eat at LJS. Ahh, WQ, if you are really curious, you can check out all the LJS stores' location. You will get your answer somehow. :P   Hmm. After that, we met Gloria and discusedd the plans for tomorrow. It was decided we are going to play basketball and/or badmintion. Yes. How meowful! After that, we went home lor.  Hmmm. Nothing to write. I reached home, bathed, came online and waiting for dinner to be cooked. Oh yes. You must be wondering why I am blogging so early. Well, I got nothing to do ma, so blog lor. Anyway, later at night, I am trying to do my MNI work. A lot to meow at!   Okay. I go liao. See ya tomorrow. Night blog (or rather, evening. Whatever la.)!
