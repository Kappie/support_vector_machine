Admittedly, before I really start in on this stuff, I know its going to be all over the place.  The tips of my fingers feel numb, yet I'm able to type well enough.    Here's the crux of it all.  Yes, once again, in what feels like a never ending cycle of disapointment (some hyperbolie (sp?)) I have once again found out that a girl I've been somewhat interested in, is in fact, interested in someone else.  And as always, I got to meet the guy face to face.  He seems decent enough, so long as you discount the fact that HE IS A TEACHING ASSISTANT IN ONE OF HER CLASSES.  Getting a Doctorite in Communications...interesting.  If I wasn't an English major maybe I'd have some moral or intellectual superiority to judge him on.  But I don't.  I'm just way bummed. Back to negative square one.  I've got nothing except self doubt, but that isn't very fun to cuddle with late at night.    Can't blame the girl, she's super sweet and if she digs this guy so be it.  Things probably wouldn't have worked anyways.   I feel as though I'm lying to people if I don't tell them the truth about my stomach stuff, yet if I do tell them, I fear they'd never want to be around me, especially in a romantic sense.  When the question is posed if I think that someone would be incapable of loving me cause of what I've got, my knee jerk reaction is, "No, of course not" because as that question stands, I don't believe it.  But when I think of all the subtle, latent and underlying issues of everything, it becomes readily apparent that I don't believe I can be loved, and moreover that its going to take an extrodinarily compassionate and understanding woman to understand.  I don't want to resign myself to singlehood, cause I don't dig it, but I don't think anyone could handle everything that I really am.  I don't even know what I want.  But I do know I don't want to sell myself short on a one night deal or something short term.  In addition, I also know I feel uncomfortable in any situation when I think there is the possibility of something romantic, and the lack of self confidence I have is utterly astounding.  When I was dumped or rejected in the past, one of the first thoughts I'd get was, "Their loss"  As of late, I haven't felt that and find it tougher to believe in as the days go by.    Random note:  To add to the perfection of misery, as I was slowly, drunkenly, realizing that she was crazy for this other guy, as her roommate told me as I waited for beer, "Hummer" by the Pumpkins came on and I was instantly transported to another place.  Not better, but actually worse.  "Hummer" is off of Siamese Dream and I listened to that album incesently freshman year, while as I look back on it now, I was fooling myself with the illusion rather than reality of a relationship.  Anyways, this is rambling a bit more than my usual taste, but "Hummer" always seemed to play as I was walking back from the Undergrad library and I would look to the sky, see the sun smiling back at me and I would get goosebumps thinking about the way the end of the solo dovetailed into Billy's exclamation of "I love you."  Those lines echoed and I always thought of the same girl.  And now, I can't stand to seeslashtalk to the girl that I once pictured and sadly, I think whatever window of oppritunity I had with Miss "E" has gone by the wayside.  Thought she did want me to call her tomorrow about going around as Sid and Nancy.  We'll see.  I just miss (but is miss the right word if no one was ever there in the first place) having solid female friends to lean on when I was feeling emotional/vulnerable.   I have "Say Anything" here at the apartment and I would  really love to be able to just snuggle up with someone special, (miss "e" perhaps) watch it and for 2 hours feel something special.  The closest I've come in the past few months was some incidental contact from a girl in my ice skating class whose leg brushed up against mine as she skidded into place against the boards.  Her voice was soft and she apologized for bumping into me, and I said it was no big deal.  Her hair is light autumn brown, curly (doesn't that always seem to be the case) and her eyes are very particular and remind me of Kate Hudson...damn it why do the girls I see, and are attracted to fall into distinct catagories?  Well, children, this drunken rambling looks to be losing its head of steam.  Counting tonight, I've spent about a handfull of nights at bars drinking solely trying to either a) get through the night because someone's boyfriend is there, b) drinking because a potential is showing up or c)  Realizing I'm not the one.  Can't I just have something good happen to me for once?
