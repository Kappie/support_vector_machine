Deadline, I should be able to meet it. Have screenie here ^^  http://img66.exs.cx/img66/8246/Wanderers1Screen.jpg Proof that I am working and almost done. Let's see...let's take a picture of the workplace too. The library's huge though :/ http://img66.exs.cx/img66/6782/Wanderers1Workspace.jpg  THESE STUPID F-BEEP-ING TAGS! Right, screw this direct linking, it's f-BEEP-ing up the toolbar thing on the side.    Note that the three Lyns aka Assassins who are not being slaughtered are still in the same place as in the movie screenshot above. This is merely due to the fact that I haven't done their fighting bit yet.   But I shall be back...with my movie next time...at least I hope i will...meh...
