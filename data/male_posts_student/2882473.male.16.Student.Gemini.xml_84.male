So, in the past 2 evenings I’ve done a bit more cooking, which I’m quite proud of. Yesterday I made some good ol’ macaroni cheese, which tasted pretty nice, although the sauce was a bit thick. Too much flour methinks. And then tonight I cooked a vegetable casserole thingy. I was going to do a Shepard’s Pie, but only remembered the mince after putting the vegetables in, and then it was a bit late. So I had chopped vegetables in water with an oxo cube and mashed potato on top, baked in the oven. Pretty good, but too much water.  Mostly today I’ve been playing on the computer, err... that’s about it. Also had a game of chess. And did a bit of reading in the morning, although no more than about 20 pages.  Well, tomorrow should be a better day; I’m going round a friend’s house to have a game of monopoly. Great game.  And finally, I’ve discovered some information about the final Star Wars film to be released, ‘Star Wars Episode III – Revenge of the Sith’. And a description of the film:  “After three long years of relentless fighting, the Clone Wars are nearly at an end. The Jedi Council dispatches Obi-Wan Kenobi to bring General Grievous, the deadly leader of the Separatist droid army, to justice. Meanwhile, back on Coruscant, Chancellor Palpatine has grown in power. His sweeping political changes transform the war-weary Republic into the mighty Galactic Empire. To his closest ally, Anakin Skywalker, he reveals the true nature of power and the promised secrets of the Force in an attempt to lure him to the dark side.”  Sounds good doesn’t it?  Well, that’s all for now, Ta ta.
