(It was about ten girls and me, I did not actually sleep over; I left around 10:30, you perv.) Some of my friends were ferociously angry with me before tonight, but for no apparant reason they have taken it into their heads to forgive me. Not that I'm complaining. Things are looking up, but, knowing me, I'll screw it up soon enough. Better enjoy it while it lasts.      This is my first web page I have ever designed (for myself) and today is its maiden voyage. Maybe the date is an omen to how this site will work, but as long as at least a few of my friends read along, it will be worth it. This section, if you didn't notice yet is my online journal, where I talk about me and what I think is important. Live with it. Everyone else does.      Sorry there wasn't much to say today... maybe tomorrow something either so horrible or so great will happen that you will care about this section at all. Haha, leave a note under "comments" if there is anything worth talking about in this first entry.       -Hunter M.
