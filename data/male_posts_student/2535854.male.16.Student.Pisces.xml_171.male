Well after like being called a million times by Afandi,he finally found my house.Cehlamak went for futsal in a limo man..haha..his one..heh...So got to Unlimited at like 12:30 something..lent Afandi 10 bucks so he could buy socks...and he lent me a pair or his futsal shoes in return and will still pay me back.nyeh nyeh!  So I was starting keeper..we played some guys named blue ( or is it silver) wings which is zainuls cousins team...damn fucking rough ppl...but their play is well organized...and their shots are blistering...I let in a hell ton of goals...  well fast foward the crap and ill write the more interesting parts here.  1.My best saves were like catch this thunderous shot from 2feet out with no problemss....but the shot was so hard it caused my fingers in my left arm to start jammin up and stuff....and my best save of ALL was like diving in front of some guy and the ball seemed to take eterntiy in the air and it came off my hip and the ball went flying safely wide of goal.Whew!  2.Got angry at the teams defendign specially in the middle of the court..very bad!  3.Adrian was like being manhandled by one guy and we were like trying to calm him down on the sidelines.Lingesht had 1 guy cari pasal with him for accusing him of scratching him and saying Fuck at him.  4.Lost eventually 14-12.so close!Oh yeah Zainul all of a sudden fell down with nose bleed...damn..hope its not serious...but he didnt bring his gk jersey 4 me so stuck wearing my sleevless dri-fit jersey for basketball :p.  5.Zainul owe me 35rm now!He needed 15 to pay but I gave 50 cause I had no change and hes suppose to pay me back soon!  So after Futsal at like 4pm,went with Afandi to his grandmas hse in Kenny Hills...damn..Lambo there...house is huge and nice..his phones kool 2 :P  Then saw his condo...then he and his driver sent me back to my place..heh.limo.haha.  had Pelita 4 dinner...did hw...online..sleep...dunno what else :p.  ok if u wanna know more,ask me!im so lazy now..this entry is damn short if you ask me!So in contrast with my previous mad blogging craze!!!!!
