It was totally wrong but I read the description of the country at the bottom and realized how true it was. Then I looked at the flag and thought wtf? It doesnt mean anything good anymore. All it shows me is a buncha invaders into a country and needless citizens dying for another country's people in a horribly poorly planned out "war" for no reason. I see a stuttering bafoon leader, someone who cant communicate with his people, and can't even stand up for his decisions. I seee abuncha crapped out politcians slowly degrading our quality of life. Our freedom is eventually evaporating, we have no leadership all it is is politicians talking about other politicians when neither one is suitable for the job.  IMO, President Bush used to be a President. But where the fuck is he. He's never in the White House. Never has been relay. He's always been in Texas or Camp David. How can you call yourself a President when you arent even working in your country's capital. Sir, you took an oath, and you have broken that oath. You aren't doing your best to preserve, protect and defend, you just want kids to read and you want to get rid of weapons in another country. Your not preserving the Country when you are sending uneccssary men to another country to die, when "all major combat has ended." I didn't think I could see anyone in office besides you, but if I had a vote, I would change it.   Woah I totally just thought of that by myslf.
