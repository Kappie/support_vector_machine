I checked the voive mail and called her back. We had another nice talk, I love talking to her and I love listening to her voice. She told me that she had a really hard decision to make. I asked her what she was talking about because I knew that she had already decided that she was going to talk ask Dan to be with her. She asked me how could she just decide on one of us when she loves spenging so much time with each one of us. My  friend Kristina (lab partner) thinks that I am crazy for even staying with this as long as I have. I just cant help it. When I think that there is something worth fighting for (though I an not doing all that much fighting) I hold on to it. Even with all of this Andrea makes me feel special.  .
