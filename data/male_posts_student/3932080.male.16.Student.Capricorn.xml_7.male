We've have testimony going on for months now in baseball, and we've had athletes admit to pre- Olympic  steroid use in the past. Even star outfielder  Gary Sheffield  outlashed against the extremist speculation going on, pushing the message that neither the fans nor the players are enjoying the whole scandal.    The Question:   Why is the drugs-in-sports issue such a big deal? Steroids have been around since the beginning of time-how the fuck do you think the tortoise beat the hare?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    The Deal:   Yesterday in  Houston, Texas,   Michael Jackson  surprised mall shoppers by showing up in a toy story after “business” (according to a publicist). Jackson went on a shopping spree for toys and stuffed animals, but ended up signing autographs for young fans and their parents.                        The Question:   Why didn't Jackson's media team advertise the toy store trip so that more fans would show up? Oh, maybe the Houston mall didn't want to publicly announce that  "Michael Jackson Will Be Cumming Today ."
