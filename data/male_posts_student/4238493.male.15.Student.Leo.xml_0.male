This is so thanks to the evil queen (talk about originality!) who reigns over the land. Man are often sold as slaves and are termed "Dumb Bells". Yet there is a prophecy who foretells a man, The Star Of Rex, who will take the holy sword Excalibur and vanquish the Evil queen. (Yawn)  Review: Take the effects of The Matrix, the backdrop of The Lord Of The Rings and finally the storyline from any fairy tale that has an evil queen and voila! You get Twins Effect 2. Despite it's almost lack of originality, it is a great movie! Slow-down effects (called Bullet time in Matrix) are placed well and weapons blend in along with the storyline, but still the effects need to look more natural. Having The Twins to act in this movie might be the only attractor for this movie. I personally think that the character of The Star Of Rex does not suit the style of Jaycee Chan's acting. The storyline seems interesting, everything is there  but in the end it isn't the sword that saved the day but LOVE. No offence against that but... They didn't mention LOVE in the prophecy! Charlene fufills her role very well as the naive, stubborn and childish natured, 13th Young Master. Also, Gillian does a above average job as the stern but trying not to be stern, Blue Bird. Guest stars vary from Edison Chen to Jackie Chan. I personally feel that Jackie Chan shouldn't be roled into the movie. The ending is horrible. Queen dies, Star of rex runs off to have fun leaving the kingdom to Charlene and husband who later gave birth to twins... Thinking that this movie is all serious? NO! There is a comdey side to it some parts are quite funny but they could be improved on.  Effects: 7/10 Good effects and not to mention cool but needs to be made to look natural.  Storyline:8/10 Strong storyline but lack developments in few areas.  Sound:6/10 Nice music that blends into the surrondings but when things get HOT the music is forgotten.  Overall:6/10 Twins' fans, watch this. While the rest watch it only if you want to spend your weekend time.
