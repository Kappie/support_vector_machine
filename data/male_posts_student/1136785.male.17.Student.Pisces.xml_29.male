Maybe I could do my homework in the afternoons, and not skip breakfast and a morning shower to do it.   That's crazy talk - you crazy.   On the plus side, I know a lot more about tax law and the ins and outs of a  urlLink 1023  form than I did a few days ago. Now to just make KC area business see things my way. (Hah, linking directly to a pdf file. What a rascal)  I miss  urlLink home .   And, continuing a trend, I  urlLink fear money . Funny thing is, the Germans tried the same thing with the Pound.  Gotta eat sometime.
