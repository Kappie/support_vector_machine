It'll be my art place and stuff, and my new blog ( Thanks Blogger for the nice services you provided me with .::. Deconstructed .::. ). Posted to news to the ones who see it important, and so I don't forget because I'll see this in one of my posts. e e' Yup. Nemui Kosetsu will be what you would call a Art Studio! It'll have pretty much nothing on any of my other " projects ". Ah, anyhow. I'm gunna fall asleep at desk if I dun get off.   Ja, ato de.  !!
