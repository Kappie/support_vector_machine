Yesterday evening, I drove up to Kelso to watch the  Sounds of Summer  Drum Corps competition. It was pretty amazing... The Division 1 corps were especially phenomenal. The Blue Devils and Santa Clara Vanguard were flawless and played so loud it made your ears burn. Those two corps are very entertaining to see and I highly recommend everyone to go watch them if their tours bring them to your neck of the woods this summer. The Mandarins are Chinese themed, with complementing uniforms and guard, making them look like a bunch of warriors in a Chinese army from centuries ago. They too were awesome and I enjoyed the different style. The Oregon Crusaders have much improved since I last watched them at PGE Park in Portland a few weeks ago. I know a lot of the members in OC since most of them come from Skyview HS. I was definetly pleased with their performance and got to talk with some of my friends who are on tour with OC. The Spokane Thunder were on the verge of terrible... many problems in many categories. But they are a first year corps... maybe a little forgiveness for them? All-around, the show was spectacular and definitely worth the hour drive and $22 ticket price.
