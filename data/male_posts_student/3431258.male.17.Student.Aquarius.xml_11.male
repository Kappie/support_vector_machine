Writed by Emeagwali in 2003. Trough the basic of a "Prediction of the future". Emeagwali explain a bit on how will technology works in 50-60-90-100 years in the future. Some of the stuff he says appear to makes sense, some of it does'nt. Something striked me tought.   As Emeagwali describe that Computers and the internet can only be viewed from a physical point of view (The internet is 10,000 kms of fiber ropes that interconnect all computers in order to facilitate Human communication). He put emphasys on the fact that computers, in the future, interlinked with the net, will form a kind of Brain. Considering the fact that in 100 plus years, computer will be a lot more faster, everything will work extremely fast. Also one thing to be considered is the electronic implants.   "In 300 years, I believe that the Internet will remain a spherical network as large as the whole world. However, because it could be a zillion times more powerful, faster, and more intelligent, I believe that in 300 years the Internet will evolve into a SuperBrain as large as the whole world."    this sums it up a bit. There is more.   "Without realizing what we are doing, we are determined to redesign ourselves. Our compelling urge to redesign ourselves is deep-seated and will remain so. We have embarked on a self-propelled evolution in which we are both the creator and the created.   Already, we have imbedded our consciousness and intelligence into computers. Now that we have implanted our intelligence into computers, we are now figuring out how to imbed our computers into our brain. That is, how to imbed inanimate intelligence into animate ones."   This is were it gets completely logical, in the end, we survived since pre-historic age as a team.Still today, everyone is linked in society.   He explain that at some part, everyone will be linked as 1 Brain.   "Unification implies that we will become one people. With one voice. One will. One soul. And one culture. "   "We will understand that we are not human beings that exist separately from other beings. Instead, we may come to believe that we are small and separate beings that exist within a Super Being."    "I began by studying the interconnectedness between millions of computers configured around the Earth. I learned that interconnected computers do emulate one supercomputer. I then inferred that we could use that knowledge as a metaphor for living entities, which we also know, are interconnected.   Therefore, I have inferred that interconnected animals and plants do emulate one Super Being."    Ok it's a bit long, but i suggest you have a read.  http://emeagwali.com/speeches/immortality/my-search-for-the-holy-grail-of-immortality.html  Regards,  Zephyr
