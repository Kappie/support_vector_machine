I really hope there is a project Echelon (google it) cause at the point I'm about ready to FLY MY METAPHORICAL JETLINE into the TWINTOWERS that is the PLACE THAT I WORK. Christ almighty. The shooting, it is unpleasant you see, but it must be done. Fucktards to the left of me, Jackholes to the right, and here I am, dear readers, stuck in the middle with you.  Nana bread is good. Try it with Chocolate chips. Thank you Ms. Giffin.  Now iTunes just came out. For Windows. This has had some ramifications on my life in several ways. One - in things not related, I'm more cheerful. Yeah, you heard me, a fucking software program is actually making me more happy in my everyday life. Everytime I sit down at my PC there is a comforting interface waiting with a FUCKTON of music hidden behind it's XML driven sheen. It's a bit of a bizarre happenstance, 90% of my music is duly pirated (fuck you RIAA and CCC); But... BUT that figure is shrinking. My god. Not only has Apple made me want to listen to music more, They've made me want to buy more.  Not this pop-y nonsense that goes around like the clap, but actually music. It's been heavenly.  Of course the frequency with which I download music has gone up as well, so maybe that number's there to stay. Needless to say, an interest in music has been kindled, or rekindled and I have apple to thank for it. An iPod shall be purchased, believe you me. Woo.
