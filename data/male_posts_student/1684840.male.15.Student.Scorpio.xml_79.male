During the time the site has been down, I have been ill and mum has gone to America for two weeks.  Last week I had 2 Science exams, they werent that hard, but they were quite challenging.  My chest is still a bit bad; everyone seems to have this cough and cold, it's probably the weather again.  Chrismas is less than 4 weeks away!!!
