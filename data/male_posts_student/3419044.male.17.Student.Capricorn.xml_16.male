English30A, which I wrote on Monday was lengthy.  Only about 5 pages long in questions but I wrote 6 pages of fullscap.  This consided of... 2 essays I think.  Perhaps 3, it was a week ago.  My other exam was Math30B.  This was a departmental, meaning I had to write a test made by the Saskatchewan government.  This was a 50 question multiple choice. Thankfully, it was multiple choice because there was a few questions I had no idea on how to complete.  These questions, I eneded up guessing on.  Both these exams took nearly the full time to write.  Just under 2 hours and 30 minutes for each.    Then, once I was done Wednesday at noon, I was officially ready to ride the SV!!  Well, I shouldn't be riding her yet...  Doctor said I can't ride until full recovery.  But I am thinking what is a couple of months?  I can't possibly miss my summer and not ride.  It's been hard enough so far.  So I made it once I was done riding exams, I would start riding again.  If I was to ride before exams, I knew I would not study a minute.    I have been riding nearly everyday and love it!  The first ride, I was worried I'd forget how to ride... not the case.  Sat on the pony and it all came back to me!  Just like that!  I guess it's like riding a bicycle, you never forget how to ride.  The SV looks so god damn gorgeous!  I will post some pictures on the new modifications and other happenings with my baby...
