At the first one we came to, there was a big box of Halloween costumes. We ended up buying these dress/tunic type things, mine green, Chris black. Then things got a little out of hand and we added masks, a bunch of watches, and plastic baseball bats. Long story short, my mom pulls up and me and Chris start banging on her windows with the baseball bats, yelling "Respect! Respect! Respect!" This story didn't really go where I had planned, but that's ok.    There was an Xbox thing tonight but I didn't go. I just didn't have the patience to sit through four hours of bad jokes while starting at a little TV in a hot room.    I went to Troy last night, with Chris and the Hobster. Except Bryce ended up actually seeing Troy and Hobie went to Van Helsing. I don't know why this happened, but me and Chris were confused about Hobie's actions. So we wrote an as-of-yet untitled song about Hobie.    One reason I will be happy when school is out is that I am really sick of seeing everybody every day.    I got this really awesome 35mm camera today for a dollar. I think the lady gave me a discount because she called my tunic a dress. Chris got a turntable.   I need to clean my car out and wash it. We were going to do that today, but you know, the tunics and the bats were too much fun.   I like going places with Chris because he connects with people almost everywhere he goes. He seems like a real person to them. Even Schilling likes Chris. I think the only people who don't like him are elitests who think they are better than everyone.    I don't like people who keep their disdain on the inside.    Next week is the last week of school. Only problem, I've got that Gatsby essay to write, and I have no idea where to start. I'm pretty sure I have a high English grade, so I'll probably just slap something together on Thursday night and cross my fingers.   Did you enjoy music this weekend? I know I did. I always do.   I,I,I,I. Always about me.
