Ever had the feeling of rejection? Acceptance? Joy? Sadness? Fear? Anger? All these feelings all make us feel differently somehow. Some hate to be rejected while others are used to it. You know what I'm talking about. Feelings sometimes hurt. Sometimes it's a good feeling. But there's this feeling that outshines all of these feelings... It's being with you. It's irreplacable. I can never get tired of being with you. You make me feel special. You're an angel here on earth. You're a blessing. I can never trade the feeling of being with you for any other feeling. And I know that this feeling within me is true.    I love you Angeline.
