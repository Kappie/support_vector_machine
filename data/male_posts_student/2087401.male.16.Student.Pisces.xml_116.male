Second: The "Is Sophia my girlfriend" report: No, but we are having a not-so-secret secret affair.  Third: My romantic history: None of your dram business.  By the way, I'm Jonah.  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
