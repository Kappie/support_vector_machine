Night Shyamalan is a film genius. He knows exactly what shots to use, what lines to say, what mystery to reveal. He sprinkles his movies with little hints and clues, just enough to make the audience scream, "I knew it!" when the final twist occurs.  His movies make you think. And that is what I love about him.  The Village is his most recent venture into the world of horror filmmaking. It tells the tale of a utopian nineteenth century town that that was settled in a valley many years prior by a group of people known as the "elders." Life is perfect. There is no money, no violence, no hate. But there is one thing: fear. The small village is surrounded by thick, dense forests. And in these forests reside terrible creatures of myth. The people of the village are taught never to enter the woods, for fear of disturbing these creatures.  The plot of The Village is very unique and creative, unlike any movie I've ever seen. But The Village's strongest quality is found in it's cast of characters. Actors like Juaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver play major roles in this film. And all of them give excellent performances. Also making her film debut is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays a young blind girl named Ivy, who is infatuated with Lucious, Phoenix's character. Adrien Brody is also excellent as a mentally disabled young man who's only playmate is Ivy.  Though The Village doesn't quite live up to such films as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, or Signs, it does have it moments.  Shyamalan tries a few new techniques, such as suddenly switching the focus of characters from Lucius to Ivy halfway through the film. Though most directors would fumble clumsily with a transition like this, Shyamalan does it in such a way that I didn't even notice until the end of the movie.  And of course, as a Shyamalan tradition, the film has to have a twist at the end. I do believe this is one of his best plot twists yet, to tell you the truth. My mouth was hanging open for a full five minutes before I realized. And though The Village is a sufficiently scary film, it lacks some of the thrills of the other films.  But I will admit to the fact that I did scream like a woman at one point in the film.  The Village is by no means a disappointment on Shyamalan's part. I would recommend any fan of Shyamalan or horror in general to go see this movie.
