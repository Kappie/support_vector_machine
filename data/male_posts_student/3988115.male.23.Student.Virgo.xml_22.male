For those of you who have never dealt with Meredith, let me give you a little example. I pick this example only because it is the most recent:  The other night Patricia was discussing with Meredith the idea that we should count people who go through the wrong side of our entrance/exit gate using a stat-clicker. Meredith then says, "oh yes, and we should add 25 to that count for the Junior Players who come through the back door and never go through our gate." So Patricia says, "ok we'lll start our daily count at 25", and Meredith then says: "but its easier if we just get someone to walk through the gate 25 times instead of adding it to our count." ... ... ...  So apparently its easier to walk through a gate in a circle 25 times than simply adding 25 to some other number. Right...
