My parents would drop me off at the day care center every day until I hit first grade...Then the bus took me...To school...(sigh)...So it begins...  In Irby, I barely ever saw the classroom for more than five minutes. I sure did know my way around that office though. I was up there everyday! I was a very very bad kid! I still kinda am! I've improved! My paretns would pick me up from Irby everyday and most days they walked into the office and saw me playing computer games cause the nice lady let me...It was so embarrassing to them. I shouted at the teacher! I never did my work, I could never concentrate on one thing. I always had to be doing something with my hands or feet. My parents took me to the doctor and he diagnosed it as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).   Well, just because they knew what it was, they never really knew what to do. I had a serious learning disability. It wasn't dyslexia or something that serious but it still stopped me and other students from learning. My parents made a final decision to put me in a private school. They put me in Chance Charter School. I spent 2nd to 4th grade in three mobile buildings in a public park in a small town. It was tough and harsh, I had some good times though.   There was Anthony, he had serious temper problems but they never resulted in violence, just a whole bunch of yelling and screaming. His brother Charles was kinda mentally handicapped but he was cool at times. Anthony was really cool, but he wasn't my best friend at Chance, my best friend there was named Mark. I only knew him for like a year but he was a really good friend. When he left, I was left with Anthony for two years. Then there where the Garrets. Jackie Garret was the principal of the school and her three sons went there. The all had serious anger problems, but the two youngest, Jake and Josh were addicted to wrestling. Me and the two brothers got off at a rough start. They always beat me up all the time. Everything I went to Jackie, she never believed me. I got so used to getting beat up by the two that I started to notice the tactics they used to do it with. I observed the types of different punches they made and different types of dodges. One day Jake pushed me down. I got up and pushed back, Josh got behind me and I turned around real quick and pushed him down too. They got up and started to tackle me. I bit and punched and kicked back until Josh, the youngest, backed off, but me and Jake were still goin at it.finaly Jake stood up with a bloody lip and said "I always thought you were a pussy, Karl."  I wanted to tear him limb from limb. But I didn't, I nodded with pain and stood up and shook his hand. My parents never really noticed any of my bruises, since we never really hit eachother in the face or anything. But I think if it weren't for the Garrets I would of stayed a pussy, ya they were jerks and they beat me up, but everybody needs a bully in their childhood, I had two. The scary thing is that this all happened in 2nd grade.   I toughened up and got rid of the little "I'm so cute" thing and put on a new attitude. After school ended they held an after school program to babysit the kids until their parents could pick them up. I always out with Jake and the guys to explore the old park. Right behind the park was a big field, and the field had an old steel tower that was about 45 feet high or so. Me, Jake, Josh and Anthony were about 7 years old when we climbed that ladder. It was the scariest thing I've ever done. But I didn't complain. The only person who complained was Josh. That day I officially grew balls! I wasn't a little boy anymore. I might of looked like one, but i had the brain of a little idiot!     I met some other people at Chance, someother people who set more of a positive effect on me. There was Mrs. Ponder, who looked past the ADHD and the attitude and saw the bright young boy I was, she took me out of the 2nd grade class and put me right into her 4th grade class. Yhe reason she did it was because i had a 4th grade reading level and she decided it would be best if i learned at a faster pace. Mrs. Ponder took care of Earl, Earl was Autistic. We all had to take up some responsibility when we took care of Earl. There was Antonio, he was the coolest kid i ever knew at Chance. When I wasn't hanging out with Jake or Anthony or Mark, I was hanging out with Antonio, He was like me, he didn't really have a mental problem, he just had ADHD and couldn't concentrate in a normal classroom enviroment, just like me. And geuss who else I met up with at Chance Charter...Micheal! We asked eachother all these questions and then we realized that we went to the same preschool! He didn't cry all the time like he used too...I swear to god that he was a real slow learner though (mabye it was the fence...)Me and him became freinds. No more bitter rivalry...  I also met Freddy Lambes, well it turns out that Freddy was just sick of his old school so he just went there...thats what he says!And finaly...I met the Zimmermens, they were an elderly couple that taught at the school. They where my favorite teachers. the summer before 4th grade was my first first summer at o2b. My parents took me out of Chance in the middle of fourth grade (during that time i was attending the after school program that O2b was having)They realized that i was too good for a private school. A couple of months later, the county shut Chance charter School down...Jackie Gerret was a complete idiot, a lunatic as a freind of mine put it. She threw away the F-cats, she never paid the teachers, most of the funding she received from the ounty she used for herself, she let the kids walk around the park unsupervised. She was real real lucky she didn't go to jail. That was another reason my parents took me out. And it was convenient because we moved into the city and right down the street from our house was Talbot Elementary.
