Highlights situations when, - missing events may cause an error - events occuring out of  sequences  Can take into several form -simple form -standared -status indicator form  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Completeness Prototype Version  - built as Initial Prototypes - same prototypes should be grouped together  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Applying Necessary Controls  - thru formal examinations to get correct performance of the proposed system - involved not only systems analyts, but users managers, internal auditor and person responsible for the project management  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Controls Prototype  - when study is complete, a full sets of controls analysis form will have been produces - includes the revisions, this is call the Control Prototype, with the deatails of controls included in the systems  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Computer Systems  - made up of a series of major sub systems. - each programs have difference task  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Completing The Physical Design  2 final steps  - design of physical database -completion of design of the computer process  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Optimising Prototype  - can be issued as a new version - user interface should be exactly the same as previous - changes should be transparent to user
