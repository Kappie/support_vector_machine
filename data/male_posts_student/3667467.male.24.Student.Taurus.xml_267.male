But the best part of the show is that it's totally bourgeois. Everyone is ugly and poor, just like the rest of us! I mean, they'll dress up to go get their prize in Los Angeles, but their home videos make them look really really bad. I guess we all wear ratty clothes when we're around the house, so now I can feel better about myself.
