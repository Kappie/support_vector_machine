Long out of print and amazingly hard to find, you took the initiative to share what may be the best one-off side project of the 90s. A shame that no one else has heard of them. Tonight, after searching for eight years (!) I finally have the music in my hands! Thank you, thank you, and thank you again. Who else wants a copy?
