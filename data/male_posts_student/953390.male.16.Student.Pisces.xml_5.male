I honestly think I got the grade needed. (Mainly because my friend Rebecca Remington and I had a little 'sharing ring' going on, but... it's survival of the cleverest.) My math teacher was one of the most cheating-obtuse people I've known, and due to serious lack of experience, I am not a good cheater. Besides, it was only like 10 problems out of 60... I feel a tad bit guilty, but she should have left us a  professional  teacher instead of some sub who resembled Cheri Oteri's wacked-out druggie character while she was gone, oh, I don't know...  half the semester!  This time, the ends  so  justified the means! It feels no different being a Junior. I guess that'll change later on when school starts again. (Yuck, don't make me even  think  about it.) I just know I have a butt-load of summerwork for AP Psych, AP Language, and AP United States History. [sigh...] As you know, I was invited to the Worth County 4-H Awards Banquet, and I am most certainly going. It's tomorrow evening. How exciting!
