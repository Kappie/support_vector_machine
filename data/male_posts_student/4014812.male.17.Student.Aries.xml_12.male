But he was too lazy to come, but thats ok cuz i wasnt even awake at 11 cuz i wasnt feeling good last night.  Yeah... the rest of the day i installed World of Warcraft and The Suffering. Both are awesome games but World of Warcraft has its problems!...  Yeah i played this games for a little while then James came over and we went swimming... Ashley and Steph decided to join along this time... Glad they did cuz i finally realized something about both of them, which will soon come into effect.  Yeah.. after the swim me and James left before them... cuz we kinda just didnt care anymore..  Gave James his copy of World of Warcraft... He was all happy joy... And then i sat here and made some food to eat which im eatting now.  Oh yeah.. also learned that Christian is coming over on Thursday which will be good :D... He's also coming back another week sometime but i dunno when yet but thats ok.  Anyway, im gonna go and watch THE AMAZING RACE now.. cuz its like the reality show type thingy ever.  **EDIT**  I forgot to update my blog yesterday... all i had to put in yesterday was a picture of my friends!... heh anyway... hes a pic of Mir, Kris and Aly    (Mir is on Left, Kris in Mid, Aly on Right) Mir says they look grubby.. but whatever.. its only a picture lol  I have another super picture... which was taken on our super party night... but i wont post that cuz dont really want too lol.
