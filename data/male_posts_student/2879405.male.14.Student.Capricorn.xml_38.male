It's so nice to be back there, in my class room, those cheerful faces of those. I didn't exclude teachers. They are also the ones whom we once again, meet. It feels good to once again, learn those nice facts in the classroom. I never grumbled about leaving the holidays for the Term. In nicer facts, i was actually looking foward to it. But 1 thing, i might get sick of school once again, when the exams are looming. i hope the spirit of new school term would stay with me, forever till i leave school.
