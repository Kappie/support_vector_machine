I've been thinking. I've been thinking about abortions and gay marriages (both of which Bush opposes, I might add).  I'm not 100% for abortions. We are thus far uncertain as to whether or not the fetus can be considered alive at any given point and time, and, even though it probably isn't conscious, I'm still against killing in general. Now let me get to my point, even though I'm not an avid supporter, I don't think it's up to me to decide whether or not a woman can get an abortion. I don't think it is anybody's choice but the woman's. Not the president, not the fucking Pope himself. I say let women at least have the option. Whether it was rape, accidental, or they just flat out don't want to have the kid, then at least let the option be there for those who want and/or need it.   This is North America for fuck's sake. I thought this was the land of freedom and liberty. Operative term: THOUGHT.  Now on to gay marriages. When a man and a man, or a woman and a woman love each other, how is it any different from when two members of the opposite sex love each other? The love I have for my father is that same as the love I have for my mother, is it not? Marriage is not about what is right or what is wrong, it is not about what is sin and what is not.   God doesn't care if two homos love each other. There's nothing he can do to stop them. Why should the church care if God doesn't? All love is universal. And that is what marriage is. It is the sacred, undying bond between two people who love each other very much. In God's eyes, we are all equal, are we not? Why should hetero couples be considered more equal than others?  People just can't fucking handle anything that doesn't fit into their definition of normal.  Humans are naturally inept to change.  Oh, and the church is fucking full of shit. Doing everything in the name of God to change the world into what they want it to be. I'm sure God was just overjoyed with the religious crusades in the middle east (that last to this very day, I might add). Or how about the slaughter of both the native americans and their beliefs. They did all that in God's name, too. Oh, then there's all those "witches" they burned back in the day, during the Salem witch trials. Oh yes, they most certainly were heretics. All 500 of them innocent villiagers. And I certainly am not sarcastic in the least.  If I were God, I'd be fucking pissed of at the Catholic church.  Marrying the one you love is a sin?  Not going to pile of bricks every sunday is a sin?  Having sex with a condom is a sin!?  God doesn't care who you marry.  God doesn't care if you worship him every damned day. He doesn't need us to worship him.  Using protection to stop the sperm from entering the woman's body is not murder, ya catholic dumbfucks.  And have you even READ ANY of the bible!? The New Testament is like the polar opposite of the Old Testament, not to mention the bible, catholics everywhere, and the church contradict themselves and their religion all the time.  And the stuff in the bible! Hooee! It's like a friggin fairy tale. Get this, in the beginning of time, God creates this dude, Adam. Adam gets lonely, so god takes a few of his ribs and makes an enitre new person out of them, a woman, called Eve. What. The. Fuck? Not to mention, the entire time Adam hangs around with a talking pig!? And then a talking snake tricks Eve into eating some crazy magic apple, in much the same fashion as Snow White, I might add. Oh, and in Revelations, there's all this jazz about giant sea beast and land beast thingies from hell that are supposed to destroy earth when the apocalypse comes.  First off, are they just making crap up!? It's likea fairy-tale!  Second, the only apocalypse that is EVER going to come EVER will be of our own doing. And the only beast I can think of that will destroy this world happens to be from Texas. The number of the beast, you ask? It is not 666, it is W. Or, rather, "dub-ya."  And did you ever read about the rapture? Apparently, the rapture is some crazy thing where God takes all of the pure people up to heaven, then destroys earth or something like that. The pure people include young children (they are born innocent), and devoted church-goers. Certainly God would not spare the Buddhists, whom devoted their lives to selflessness and helping others. You can be a gay-bashing son of a bitch, but still make it into heaven if you praise God. Yes, the don't even care that you make gays everywhere feel like shit and kill themselves every day. Oh, and lets not forget that killing yourself is a sin, and that you go straight to hell for that. What a load of crap.  Ahem, ok, enough religion-bashing for now.   I've been wondering, what would be worse; being born without an arm, or having one ripped off?  Either way, you end up without and arm. So really, it is up to preference.  Scenario one, you are born without an arm, either through some birth control defect, or perinatal complications. Say, for the time being you are right handed, and happened to be born without your left arm. So, this way you can at least go to school. You go to school, and the first day, all the little kids see your lack of an arm, and, being as harsh as children are, taunt you for it. They call you "flipper boy" and laugh and beat you up.  Scenario two, your arm is ripped off in a horrible car accident. Every other part of you is fine, save only your left arm. Again, you are right handed, so you go to school with the other boys and girls. You get, there, they notice your lack of your lack of an arm and your wicked nasty scar. You are both feared and reveared with an aura of mystery. Was it ripped of by a psycho? Did he cut it off? Lose it in an awesome BMXing accident? None of them want to say anything because, since you once had it and knew the joy of it, it is a tragedy. Nobody teases you.  Is loss characterized only by having something and then losing it? It would seem so. Ha!   You know what I don't get? I get less respect than a piece of steel or a tiny insect.  A piece of steel. If I walk into a room and demand the respect and obedience of everybody in that room, there is a very good chance that it will not happen. Walk into a room with a little piece of steel that has a trigger and little lead things inside of it, and they will fear and repect you.  A tiny insect. With the whole west nile "epidemic" floating around, people are more afraid of mosquitoes than they are of getting in a car accident with a drunk driver. Some people see mosquitoes and run. Others do not leave their houses at certains times of day. Others smother their bodies with harsh chemicals to ward of the winged little demons. It is a fraction of my size, and it get's more attention than I do.  What-evar.  I didn't sleep afucking wink last nite.  Summer sucks shit. It's half over and I haven't done fuck all.  I've been going to the gym for the past 2 months and I have no fuckingresults.  Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
