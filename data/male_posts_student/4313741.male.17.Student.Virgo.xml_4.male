I've been extremely sick for the last two days, i register for college tomorrow, and i turn 18 in in 8 days... yay getting older... ahem i'm gonna buy lottery tickets and porn! well... probably not porn... but definately some lotto tickets. i think it would be great if i won big on my 18th hee hee hee
