I've recently realized that I haven't had the motivation required to keep a blog going, and that my posts have never been very personal, thoughtful, or interesting in any way. I have been trying to run a blog for the wrong reasons, none of which were actually for my personal reflection and growth. I have recently been spending far too much time on the computer, getting absolutely nowhere with the development of a new blog, when it was actually my current blog that needed help. I guess that I just need some time to do other things, and maybe along the way I will develop some great ideas and find some motivation. Anyway, thanks to my family and those few other people for reading. I'll be back in due time.
