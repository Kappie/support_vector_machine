Ah well, maybe I'll just turn off my brain this week for a while and let everything come to me, gently. :)  Monday... I have to get back to work on Tuesday. Damn, and to think I was so relaxed whole this time. Seems like everything must have an end. And so it does.  Tuesday, over Wednesday, Thursday and Friday... Just a lot of stress and fucked up situations, waste of time and energy reserved for happiness... When will people realize what life's all about, when will someone finally understand what it is I'm constantly all about?  Saturday... I'm in bed, maybe with someone I love, maybe I'm happy, maybe I'm not thinking about anything, maybe I just know what it's all about!  Sunday... Can you see me, feel me? Do you know me anymore, did you take the time needed to get to know me? No? ...I thought so...  C'ya!
