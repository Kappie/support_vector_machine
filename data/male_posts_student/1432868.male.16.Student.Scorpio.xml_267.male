The answer I put down for the short answer was....microarrays are used to locate small aliens... seems right? I dunno I blew that question pretty badly. God damnit, the year is almost over why the hell aren't the teachers winding down. Why is Loughridge the only teacher who is done for the year.  oh yeah and rediscovered my old fear of needles today
