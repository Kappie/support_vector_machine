Me and Charli had an arguement last night to which was my fault, I over reacted and she hung up, so I got pissed off eventually that got sorted at like 1 in the morning then she said "Is there anything else you want to tell me" and recently theres this girl I kind of have a tiny crush on so I wanted to be honest so I told her and basicly from there everythings gone to hell, 6 months of the happiest days of my fucking life just thrown away because I had to open my big stupid fucking mouth! This went on until like half 3 when I eventually turned my phone, off, phoned her this morning and things were better, we'd both calmed down and we agreed to meet up and talk but Im extremely fucking scared cause I just know something bads going to happen... you know, 6 months I've been with her and not one day have I ever regretted except today, I wish I could take all of it back and just not said a word cause now phone conversations are screwed up, when I think of her I have this sick feeling in my stomach and I just know things arn't going to be good today. Im sorry everything yet I cant take any of it back because no matter what I do or say she probably wont trust me, I cant say anymore, my minds a total blank anyhow I got to go cause my tutors here soon not that Im gonna take a word of what he says In, I wish I had someone to talk to, someone who could listen to me but Its stupid because these days no advice given can help things arn't that simple, you cant walk around and live a normal happy life because the next fucking corner you turn is going spring something new on you that will totally fuck up your life! Enough ranting time to get mathical. Bye
