It rained, it poared, and I couldn't plug in my computer for fear of lightning, when the rain finaly subsided, I couldn't connect to the net. So I waited. And waited. And waited. So finaly I said to no one in particular "Damn, I wish the net would work," and then my little bro came screamin into my room and yellin "It's back on, it's back on," apperently he had been sitting trying to get to google the whole time.  I have come to the conclusion that I have psychic powers or something. Today has been the freakyest day EVER. I wonder if anything will ever happen like this ever again. I did get alot of reading time in though.  An hour ago I made some progress on my desktop, now when ever I double click somewhere on it, it will hide EVERYTHING. If I can find some good webspace I'll upload it for you. (gonna have to come up with some version numbers, I'v been working on this for a while)
