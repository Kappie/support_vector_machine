But anyway, we went for a meal on Sunday and it was really nice. I had some chicken-bacon-cheese thing! Yemate!  I have also finally set up my tank. It looks really nice but half of the equiptment doesn't work. So I'm gonna have to get replacements.  I had a job interview. It was only my second ever and it was really nerve-wracking. But luckily the woman who interviewed me was really kind, and she kept writing down answers to questions I didn't know! Hopefully I'll have a job by weekend...
