Anyway, I started playing FFIX again today, for what other reason than: I'm bored. *Dodges a pewter statue of Cloud Strife* -and that Final Fantasy is unrivaled as the greatest series of games ever created and the people of SquareSoft/Square-Enix are gods among men and anyone who believes otherwise should be cast down to the depths of Hell to burn with the likes of Hitler and whoever was responsible for "Temptation Island."  Happy?  Got the "Best Sessions" DVD set of Cowboy Bebop today, too. 6 more episodes in no real order or continuity, but screw it, it's more Bebop.  I suppose that's about it for today. *Gets hit in the eye with a Moogle*  ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE OF YOU THREW THAT!?
