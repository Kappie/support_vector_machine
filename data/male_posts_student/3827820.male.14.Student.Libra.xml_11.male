Luckily we reached there early, so that we can aviod the lunchtime crowd for Teppanyaki! (Of course, not to mention, my mom did a very plasure shopping for her cosmetics!)  Went to Sushi King for snack at 3pm... really tired of shopping and eating and walking! *Phew...  Bah, read the same old programming books in MPH... came across some Maths question which reminds me of my unfinished Maths homework (still bothering me when I'm doing shopping!), aw!  Went to Aunt house at 4.30pm, younger brother playing PS for the whole evening, forcing me to play he old time game Scrabbel with my bored dad. Mum had a great time chit-chatting (crapping?) with my Aunt...  Aunt's family and my parent went out for dinner, leaving me and my brother at aunt's house. Bored, duh!  Teddy-O-Ted, bored to death!  *Tips of the day - When you know your mum wanna buy cosmetics, please choose a crowded time slot so that she can't buy a thing (which makes her leave quickly!) Haha!
