I haven't done my chores I said I'd do last night, and I'm looking at another week of school including Mrs. Saum and her plan to curse us with the damned creative writing project. ::beaten down with proverbial writing project stick:: arg!!  Last night was dull contrary to what I was predicting, sort of. But hey-who knew? Damn I need to go skiing soon-I've been snow deprived since Winter Break, and its not fun when you have perfectly good skis sitting on the porch beckoning you to go to Afton Alps. Sounds tempting, huh? Yep.  I've got this strange feeling that this week is going to suck even more than the last, which is near impossible considering having to get up at 6:30 for the first time in a few weeks. I nearly forgot my locker combo too-fun. At least there isn't choir this week, and there's always Jazz Band (yay).  Now its 9:30, and I'm going to bed, without doing my chores.  I'm outta here, Brendan
