As I discovered it last week it really had me thinking of why anyone would want to use a traditional email client to read their GMail.  Once you pull your GMail off the server your right back were you started.  The idea behind GMail is the features and the public space of 1GB, non of which are available once you download all your mail.  Why a POP3 program for GMail?  I could see this program being extremely handy if you ever needed to convert from GMail to another service provider.  You could simply download your email from GMail, and you're done.  No reason to login to GMail any more.
