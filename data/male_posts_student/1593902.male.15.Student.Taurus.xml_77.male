If we must die, O let us nobly die, So that our precious blood may not be shed In vain; then even the monsters we defy Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! O kinsmen! We must meet the common foe! Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, And for their thousand blows deal one deathblow! What though before us lies the open grave? Like men weâ€™ll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!                                      Claude McKay, 1889-1948
