I have no idea what was going on, something having to do with assertiveness.  But they wanted words describing situations so this is what I came up with.  awesome, cool, fearful, beautiful, sweetheart, drunken, slayer-ific, sweet, hard core, ass, gastrointestinal, infusion, satan, nightmare, screaming, turkey, presidential, bullshit, gone, pompeii, mondo generator, wailing, mcDonalds, driving, bananas, cancled, thanksgiving, leaving, hug, much love, yelling, exercise bike, hooters, creme pie, gas station, thin lizzy, snow, family, egg nog, feces, dogs, hunting, pickuptruck, phone, ignorant, ignoring, beer, jailbreak  I'd like to see what that brings up when they do the study...particularly slayer-rific...
