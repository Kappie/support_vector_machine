"You make every show by virtue of being male" I recall that thats why you stayed with it, simply because you can get a part sans actual acting ability.  No insult to yours, but you really don't improve it by such low standards, so shut your trap about how your program sucks.  Ooh, looks like you just got served.  Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.
