Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has said that Ratzinger feels that,  "A Catholic would be guilty of formal cooperation in evil, and so unworthy to present himself for Holy Communion, if he were to deliberately vote for a candidate precisely because of the candidate's permissive stand on abortion and/or euthanasia. When a Catholic does not share a candidate's stand in favor of abortion and/or euthanasia, but votes for that candidate for other reasons, it is considerredremote material cooperation, which can be permitted in the presence of proportionate reasons."  Many liberal mouthpieces, such as Andrew Greeley, have run with this statement claiming that this implies that Catholics are free to vote for whomever they choose, including John Kerry, if they find other reasons to do so.  In his July 16 article in the Chicago Sun-Times Greeley shows his true colors by making a cheap stab at the Bishops who have defended the Eucharist by stating that, "The few bishops who excluded Catholics from communion if they voted for Kerry didn't know much traditional moral theology."  Individuals like Greeley are entirely political and have no desire to educate the laity. In the same article Greeley then suggests that the bishops could better act as beacons of light if they would "more noisily oppose the Iraq war and suggest that Catholic politicians who support the death penalty are not following the teachings of the Church. "  By simple consideration of the numbers anyone can see that abortion is taking more lives than capitol punishment and while we cannot forget about capitol punishment, abortion is clearly the dominant issue of our day.  However, it's worth analyzing whether Ratzingter's alleged point is truly applicable, or just ammunition for more useless palaver. The question is: What are proportionate reasons? How often do they exist? Are we really faced with such a situation now? Despite Kerry's liberal positions on life issues are his other beliefs enough to render Catholic support of his campaign "indirect material cooperation?"  Allow me to quicky opine . . . I virulently reply "No!" Simply research his incomprehensible voting record. I could continue but would rather leave it to everyone else to discuss.  What are "proportionate reasons?" Many American Catholics are now using this arguement to support a number of questionable politicians.  Could they be right?
