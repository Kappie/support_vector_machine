How we first met was really quite amusing, I was on work experience at his dad's work, Nexus. The job itself was pretty boring but when I met him I was like, wow, these kind of people really exist. I was squealing inside with joy. Later on, after I'd left the workplace, I e-mailed him to soon find out that he was also gay. The result of his reply was a huge grin on my face for the next two days :D.  I'm now going to a post-exam dinner with chris, his boyfriend, grace (the "crazy lesbian") and a whole bunch of other gay guys and girls. I think I've finally found my place in the world, I haven't had a 'bad' day since. I feel kind of strange because he and all his friends are 17/18 and I'm only 16 but they all seem really nice, and in the end, that's what counts.  Oh, another thing. Last night at latin dance a guy came in. Brown and beige shirt, first 3 buttons undone at top, silver necklace. Bleached jeans at the front and black formal shoes. He had blonde hair that was 'oh so very gay' :p Turned out that he was checking me out for quite a while when I was dancing with kate, or so Bridget tells me. He was very cute but I think a little to cute for me.  LIFE IS GREAT!!!  Can't stand life without dance at school, quitting foods and swapping back to dance instead.Latin comp is coming up soon at wrest point casino, it's gonna be really big.  ~Paul
