I searched for a proper definition of blogging, and I found this:    A blog is basically a journal that is available on the web. The activity of updating a blog is "blogging" and someone who keeps a blog is a "blogger." Blogs are typically updated daily using software that allows people with little or no technical background to update and maintain the blog.    Well, i guess it's just too bad that what I saw was something more like this:  " sleepiness  work was so long today omgod and i sewar people like to come in at 10 right when we close... jeez, stayed till almost 1045 cleaning.. and i can't sweep.. BLAH i dunno how to sweep, then raymond mopped teh floor for me, so i washed the dishes bleh tired"  Wow, how interesting, that really contained so much information! You know what? I'm gonna start writing about every single thing I did on a normal day, jackass. Jeez, what's wrong with all these people?! oh well, here's my version   Today  Today I woke up, and my ass hurt. I got out of my bed and my ass hurt. I had a shower but my ass still hurt. I didn't have lunch coz I couldn't be bothered. So i just said, bleh, whatever, can't be bothered. Then I went to sleep again, coz I couldn't be bothered to keep my eyes open. Bleh. Wtvr. Cant be bothered.  Heh, I swear, u guys are just slowing search engines down, delete your shit off the internet, don't leave waste around! The funny thing is that these guys actually get comments aswell, which sound exactly the same. Anything else..? Oh yea, the perfect example is  urlLink here .
