 I planted trees today. Woo-hoo. It was actually kind of nice, except for spreading the manure. It looks pretty scraggly now, but who knows, maybe I'll come home next summer to a... less scraggly hedge. 
 I'm getting a little antsy for some sort of adventure. I want to roam somewhere at night again, with a couple of friends, or go Camping or something. If anyone is interested in going camping somewhere for a couple nights let me know. We can go to Saltspring, or up island a little ways.
