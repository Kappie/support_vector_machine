Really need to work on that.  Tomorrow is my 'taster day' at sixth form, I haven't applied to anywhere else so if I don't like it then I'm in for a bit of bumpy ride really. If I do then that's excellent. Let us hope for the latter option.  So tomorrow I will be back; back without a Caramac.   [Yes that was a cheap excuse to get a rhyme in but I do have a Caramac at the moment which is lovely.]
