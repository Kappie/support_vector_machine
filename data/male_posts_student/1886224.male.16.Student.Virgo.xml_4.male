After waking up around 10:30 this morning and helped my parents with work in the back yard, I went to the North Babylon High School today to play handball with a few of my friends.....for at least 5 hours. It was hot and very tiring at the end. We went to Adventure Land in Farmingdale tonight and there were some pretty hott (or bangin') girls there. My friends and I talked to a few and messed around with each other but nothing big happened. Anyways, I just got home about an hour ago and I'm ready to go to sleep. I'm still waiting on the picture I sent to myself through email of us playing handball. I'll post it up when ever I get it. Until later, pe@ce out!
