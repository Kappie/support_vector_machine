(anagrams peeps anagrams, you know rearrange the letters…) (i.e: William Joseph Kraft is makeshift pillowjar) A turkey and a pillow jar… *shuggs* Damn you know we are odd. And, btw you are so not fat!  I swear these gay men and “I am so fat” thing.  Boi, please I weigh 3 pounds more then you and I’m a mere 6/7ths of a inch taller then you!  A question of the origin of banana, that is, the word banana. That would be the etymology of banana, right? Just wondering if that person had their mouth stuffed with them and someone asked "What are you eating?"  [Snakes] 	An old tale my grandfather told to my stepmother when she was younger.  My grandfather was an uneducated man that learned hard life lessons because he had to.  Although never graduated from high school, he has knowledge beyond all realms of reality. While he was alive, I barely knew him, but he is in fact a man that I greatly admire.  He was a man that deserves recognition.  Life is education, not necessarily school.  Not to say that schooling isn’t important but life itself can teach you amazing lessons.  So, here is his theory: 	Three snakes are crossing the road.  Along comes a truck and runs over one of those snakes.  Now one snake is going to stay behind and the other will finish crossing the road.  What one of them are you?  If you are the one to stay behind, you may have a heart but you are sidetracked way too easily.  The other snake that finished crossing the road may have looked over his shoulder, but they know that they have a purpose and they know that they need to conitue on.  Neither one of them is bad, it makes you think don’t it?  What what one are you?  *trumpets blare*  Every evening, pastels of twilight slowly glow Awaking dreaming, spots of stars begin to show   All alone the drive was long He was singing with the sound  While finishing his favorite song  He pulled slowly into town  The seminar would start at five According to the invitation Before checking in he would drive And try to find the right location  In the darkened square at night Offices and shops were closed  But beyond there was a light  Glowing treetops were exposed  Blue then green the aura changed The driver’s eyes were opened wide A farmer’s field seemed rearranged He pulled up slowly along its side  “Quick now, men, ease it down There’s a car quite near the field Someone might just hear the sound My hope is we won’t be revealed.  Put her down beyond the shed They might see our engine’s shield A few more minutes here, instead All evidence must be concealed.”  Forcing the phone between his knees The governor’s aide let out a sigh Fifteen calls in thirteen days Regarding something in the sky  At a peaceful, placid lake Ducks were bobbing, half awake Exploding suddenly to sky Squawking, screeching, flying high  Believers in their cozy rooms Never thinking thoughts not given Without a thought, never assume  From sofas, movies and easy living  Florescent midnight basement light Assembly rooms, white coats and tools Circuit boards and miles of wires Naïve, unsuspecting fools  “That ignoramus Einstein fool A century of unquestioned laws Science built on information Gathered from equipment flaws   And here we wait within this field If discovered, you know the plans By your oath you are duty bound Our craft not pass to other’s hands.”  The businessman was filled with awe Weaving among the stiff corn stalks Recalling the strange light he saw The aura gone, but still he walks  “Call the base, he’s getting close Tell them that we might be seen We’re ready for the Exit Process Self destruction with auto-clean.”  Screaming tires down Highway nine A large truck pulls into a lane  Lights ablaze, siren wailing Farmer Jones says, “How insane!”  “Out, sir, now!” the bullhorn blares “Environmental Problem Team!” The businessman jumps out and stares Uniformed staff swarm the scene  “Leave the work to our patrol, Mr. Jones, go back to sleep The situation is in control We’re gathering data we must keep.”  The hotel bed comforts his thoughts Of living now among the norm The water parts, the crew returns Recalling fearful oaths they’ve sworn  Every dawn, twinkles of mist amongst the dew Awake the dreaming, a lovely scene observed by few
