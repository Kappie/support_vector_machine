That's the most time consuming. I have yet to see someone who still had a neat suitcase when they came back home; usually there is a roughshod pile of debris crammed into one side of the case while the other side has some layers of clean clothes mixed in with random souveniers, as tectonic shifting has caused the folded shirts to mix with, say, the socks or a snowglobe. All clothes, whether worn or not, must be washed. Clean clothes may have been contaminated by close location to the "dirty clothes bag" and a lack of fresh airflow. Then comes the cleanup of miscellany: receipts, brochures you kept for no reason whatsoever, camera film rolls, that hotel card key you ended up not having to return to the front desk. Those don't have to be washed, but you have to find them first. During the trip you have excercised every one of the 13 pockets in your suitcase for the sake of convenience, and now you can't find a thing. Don't tell yourself these objects are useless, however, even though they are. If not cleared away, you'll be in Orlando finding cough drops you put in your bag in Washington three years before, look at it for a second, think "what the hey, why not," eat it and die of pneumonia a month later. It happened to President Harrison, you know.  Q: "Heigh ho for our Cape Cod, Heigh ho Nantasket, Do not let the Boston wags Feel your oyster basket." -Original verse to "Yankee Doodle"
