Ha, she went to the neighbors house and had her little sister Natile, run up to ring the door. What a dork lol. We went to McDonalds. I got my cap and a hashbrown. I love there caps, so does alyssa thats why we went. So that boosted my day up. I left school after lunch. Josh didnt go to school so I figured I did'nt have to either. lol. So today nothing really happend. We went to Taco Bell for lunch today. After that we had to swing by to pick up a cap for me and Alyssa and apple pies for Josh and Luke. Yes, Josh came to school today!!!!!! I think  I am addicted to caps. I dunno what to day. I just love caps!! Today nothing really happened else today. I had to work. We were busyer than hell!!! I need a break lol. But thats about it.  Untill the next blog session comes, This was another episoide of Eric's Life, Staring...Eric Brown (AKA Hacker)
