(my best bet) you  don't  want to know.... after the concert i went to starbucks with allison and claire... there we met a black guy named courtney (from aurora).... i dunno why ... but he knows mike pavis (one of the coolest people around these parts)... so im cool....and we were sitting there and claire began to tweak out ... she was going crazy...... the way she usually does when the opposite sex is around.... then we finished up and now im here.. and i think i will go to bed... goodnight....
