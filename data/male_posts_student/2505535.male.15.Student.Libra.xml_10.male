So I'll try not to waste my last day of the holidays, today I've already watched 3 hour long American TV shows: SG1, Farscape and Angel, it was kinda cool, I'm planning to go play some Mario Kart DD now that Dave's awake. Already got Toad + Toadette, w0o! pwn3d.  Yesterday I ordered tickets to see SiKth, in like 5 places there was only 1 left, took us ages to find a place where there were at least 2, eventually wayahead had some, w0o! damn lucky, I think all tickets are gone now.. or as good as.
