BM.. then Physics.. and BI.. then history.. during history i asked my friend.. 'what time woi.. sien ar.. when's the bell gonna ring?'. 'fuck you look at your own watch.. ' he said.. i forgot.. my watch was on my wrist... who cares.. just glanced through my watch.. saw the time.. and continued listening to my teacher. talking about boring parliments..   wait... what was the time again.... it was 11:11am.. i looked back.. from 11:11am it changed to 11:12.. for the second time.. i didn't care much about what time it was.. the only thing i knew was 48 minutes more for the last bell to ring.  i reached home...in the car.. asked my mom.. 'sometimes.. 11:11 really caught our attention yeah? '11:11 that's the only time with 4 digits the same.. 22.22 are hard to see... you don stay up that late.. and.. there's no 22.22am? as there're 11.11am and pm.. you see them more often' she replied. 'but.. you see them don you?' .. 'yeah.. last night..' she answered.  after supper.. i switched on my laptop.. connected to the internet.. and surfed the net.. went to.. of course  urlLink www.house-o-celebs.com  to check if there's any updates.. and cnn.com.. and so...o..  there's this site.. explaining crop circles.. and there.. i could feel.. like a cube of ice.. ran behind neck in 0.1 seconds... and the wated from the ice dipped on both my hands.. cold..
