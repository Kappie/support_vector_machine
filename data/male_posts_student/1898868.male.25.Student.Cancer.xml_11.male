So I think it would be interesting to set someone up and see what they'd do if you asked if they'd watch something for a minute (like a bike, or whatever), walked away, and then had a friend go over and get on the bike and try to ride it away.  Also, I was riding my bike by that bar on addison where people play board games.  I thought it would be funny (or maybe lame) to walk in and try to intimidate people by wearing a three-piece suit, pocketwatch, and monocle, and challenging people to a game of monopoly.
