I saw animals with blood and intestines strewn across the highway, and at one point, I saw this huge patch of blood and muscle but no carcass.  2. I need to go to a big University, that melds well with the surrounding city.  After seeing the huge city rise up out of nowhere, and only part of it actually being the college, I was amazed.  3. I can't go to school where it's cold.  Nuf'said.  4. Lauren getting sick in the middle of the night, is not an excuse for me to shit my pants.  If you've been following my life, and know who Lauren is related to, you can understand why I was so panicked when my parents left the hotel at 11:30 at night.  5. Black Liberation is not a game.  It's not.  Syracuse has a horribly depressed Black Community of townies.  The student run paper "The Black Voice" is insane.  I seriously shit my pants a second time when I read it, and it's a weekly so Lauren has to send me them weekly.  It's great stuff.  Especially their seven point program.  I NEED to go to a school with angry black people like that.  Since I can't keep that up forever.  6. Tire tracks are scary as hell.  I saw some skid marks, well I saw alot, but I saw this one pair that scared the shit out of me, and made me glad I didn't have a permit since my father would have made me drive.  These skid marks went from the left lane, all the way to the ditch on the right side of the road.  You knew their was a crash there, but the world had just as soon forgot it.  Scary shit.  Especially because I knew it was a popped tire.
