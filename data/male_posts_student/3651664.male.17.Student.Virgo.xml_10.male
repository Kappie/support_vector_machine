He said that Obama's vote against a bill that would have outlawed late-term abortions violates the rights of the unborn. This man is a pioneer. Back before the Civil War, the opinion of the white male slaveholders towards their slaves was that they were nothing more than property -- and that the slaveholder should be able to treat his slaves however he wants. This is the Democratic position towards abortion. So an irresponsible 17-year-old girl gets pregnant, but the child that is the result of her irresponsibility is worth nothing -- it's just the girl's property. Now Keyes, instead of demanding reparations for the treatment that his ancestors suffered, has turned around and tried to get unborn children the same equal rights that his people fought for. What a great man. Barack Obama's response? He suggests that Keyes is outside the moderate mainstream of state Republicans. The same man that stood up in the Democratic National Convention and told the American people to vote for John Kerry -- the most liberal member of the Senate -- is saying that Keyes isn't right for the senate seat because he is too conservative. Hmm...
