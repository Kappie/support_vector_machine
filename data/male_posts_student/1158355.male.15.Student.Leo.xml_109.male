Paul kept thinking he was a woman god and kept stepping away from reality by trying to "do stuff" with random 18 year old girls. We went back to Ricky's and played Halo. Then everyone seperated. Now I'm tired and I'm just hanging around my house by myself and going to bed early to catch up on a shit load of sleep. Later.
