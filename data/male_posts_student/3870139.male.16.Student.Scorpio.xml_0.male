Well, hard for me to resist but honestly, i'm just carried away. Bet you take it as corney and a cliche-type, but for me, it is worth piercing to the hardest entity of our human emotion. I myself who is proven to be numb(numbing me?!) got carried in every scenes especially the last excerpts of the movie. I find it inspiring to live the life to the fullest as what am I doing now. It gave stresses my point of "Life no matter how short or long is still life, love is the element that prolongs and shortens our finite life".
