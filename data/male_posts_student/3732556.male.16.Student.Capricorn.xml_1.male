At the same time, Holland had to face Latvia. The thing was that Germany was 2nd and if they beat CZE it'll be Germany and CZE in the quarter finals. So already we wanted CZE to beat Germany. Holland would have to beat Latvia and become 2nd to go through to the quarter finals as only the 1st and 2nd teams go through.     At first Germany was equal during the match 1 all but CZE being a good team undefeated beat Germany 2-1. This was perfect as it meant that either Holland or Latvia would go through. The goals came flowing in from Holland ending that match with 3-0, goals from Ruud and Makaay. As a result, Holland were through to the semi-finals to face Sweden.
