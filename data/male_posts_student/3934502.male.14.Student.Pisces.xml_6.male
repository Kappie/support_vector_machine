Today, Miss Peh (Math Teacher) made us present our findings on the application of linear graphs in everyday life, which was much to our horror and surprise. Of course, few of us actually did it and in the end, only two groups were prepared while another two made impromptu presentations and the majority of the class ended up not having done a single thing. As a result, those who had not presented at all got a definite 0 out of 9 marks for their presentation. Then I keep forgetting my work again (punishment likes me - but I don't like punishment), so I got scolded again, and again, and again. Nothing much really... Hehe. Eve Online rawks, but the only problem is buying a code for it... Sigh. Any way, this is my first post, so stay tuned for more updates!
