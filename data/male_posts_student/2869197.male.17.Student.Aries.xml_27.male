These words strike disgust in some, hope in others, and others just start loading their automatics. This tangled web is a great problem in my phiosophical life. I so dearly want to agree with those who support "love and free will" mongst the same-sexers, yet still hold to the biblical truth so prevelant among the heterosexual clan.   Let's begin at the beginning. Homosexual sex is wrong. We can get that from a couple verses in the Bible but let's focus on Romans 1:18-32 since its New Testament (so as to escape the Old Testament "burn the defilers" rhetoric), applies to both men and women, and seems quite straightforward to me. In effect, God gives the evil peeps of our world over to their sexual impurities, and they "commit indecent acts with other men". I hate this verse. It is the anathema of all the never-hurt-a-fly God and anti-brimestone speaks I've heard. But it is there, glaring at me, dispelling doubt even when it was a beautiful cloak to protect me from the world's eye. Homosexuality seems to be a trap, a snare the wicked fall into. But more so. God seems to be laying the trap! The saving grace is God only acts this out after they replace God with a lie, Creator for the created. They don't walk into a hidden snare, but walk off the lighted, guide-railed highway into the dark and forbidden.  The system is down. All that is good and wholesome is being lost to replacements, and sickening ones at that. Standard marriages lost to same sex ones, unmarried sex replacing good old married sex. Some would say it is a sign of the times. I like the path I have. Why leave it for something less?
