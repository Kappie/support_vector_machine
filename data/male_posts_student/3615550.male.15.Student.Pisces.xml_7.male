Practically every rapper out there has been arrested for drug related crimes, or at least has been involved in drug related crimes, and other crimes among rappers are not exactly a rarity.  Why do we let these creeps continue to influence the youth of America?  Let's just send our kids to visit a maximum-security prison and have them buddy up with some of the prisoners; then at least the rest of us wouldn't have to listen to their profane music.    These rappers steal, do drugs, murder, and delight in fornication, all the while they are singing about it and telling America's kids how great sin is.  What are the kids doing listening to that crap?  To borrow from Bunnie Diehl, I believe that rap (of the variety that I have just menioned) would definately qualify as "craptacular."  Actually, that's an understatement, considering that the term "craptacular" does not even take the sin or the glorification of sin into account.  The kids of America are horribly irresponsible.  That really gets on my nerves.  Unfortunately, the reason they are irresponsible is because their PARENTS are irresponsible.  Parents let their kids listen to such blatantly evil "music," watch horrible movies, and then put their kids on Prozac because they can't figure out what the problem is.  And don't even get me started on ADD...  When a Christian society and heritage collide with such anti-Christian values found in rap and many other areas of our culture, something's got to give.    To paraphrase: "All that is required for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing."    Be blessed, everyone.
