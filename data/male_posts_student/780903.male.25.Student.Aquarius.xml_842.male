Notes on flipping through my Corporations casebook ("Business Associations" by Klein/Ramseyer/Bainbridge -- Bainbridge has a blog  urlLink here , incidentally; Ramseyer is the professor I've got for the class):  1. Great introduction ("if a case is no fun, we omit it") "Lean, we think, but not mean."  We'll see if that holds up.  2. From the Summary of Contents, there's a section on "Grabbing and Leaving."  Sounds like a unit on sexual harassment.  "Short-Swing Profits" hopefully has to do with baseball.  "Freeze-Out Mergers" take place only in the Northeast in winter.  3. Winning the "double letters" award is the case of Hoddeson v. Koos Bros.  4. Winning the "case that sounds like it took place a long time ago and will be a pain to read" award is National Biscuit Company v. Stroud.  5. Winning the "case with potential for a funny footnote" award is In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants Products Liability Litigation (which is not, unfortunately, in the "Grabbing and Leaving" section).  6. Case name that gives me the chance to riff on something else for a few sentences: Springside Nursing Home.  Why are all nursing homes given sunny names -- never Cloudy Village retirement community, Stormy Night senior center, Autumn of Your Life homes and condominiums.  "Springside."  Right.  Although I have a friend who went to a Shady Side High School.  Shady Side.  Unbelievable.  Where's the drug problem in your town?  Over in the Shady Side schoolyard.  Gotcha.  6. Funny names in cases include: Humble Oil and Refining, Paw-Saver Corporation, Gay Jenson Farms, Flying Tiger Line Inc., Elf Atochem North America, Van Gorkom, Wheelabrator Technologies, Basic Inc. (couldn't get more creative than that, Mr. CEO?), and Sharon Steel Corporation (look, honey: I named my steel corporation after you!!).  7.  This casebook's got "Analysis" and "Problems" after the cases.  Not again.  Why don't they ever have "Summary" and "Explanations" or "Wrapup" and "Simplification" or "Answers" and "More answers" or "Exam hints" and "Fun irreverent facts" or like Reader's Digest, just stick some jokes down there if you need to fill up the rest of the page!  "Humor in a Dark Conservative Suit"! :)  8. There's no appendix.  My Con Law book had this neat section in the back with the names of all of the Supreme Court Justices, perfect for a quick and easy Supreme Court "We Didn't Start the Fire" parody.  (Check the  urlLink index , you'll find it.)  Here's there's nothing.  No list of shamed Enron executives or anything.  Aw, nuts.
