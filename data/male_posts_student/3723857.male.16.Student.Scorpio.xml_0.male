This time I'm really in hot soup..  Haha if you've known a girl for 2 months is it a bit too quick to ask her out? My bro said yes.. and I'm starting to think that its true too..but no choice cos she's really too nice.. how many girls now are that nice? Its not just a pretty face that matters you know..but now I don't think she'll like me already ~>.
