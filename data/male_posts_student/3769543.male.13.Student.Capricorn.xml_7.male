If you guys want me to lend you a video of it, I'll be willing to do so. It's hella funny. Going to see "The Terminal" with Anna 2 , Kii, and Heidi. Funs-ville.   [After the show]   Wow! That's all I have to say! Great cast, great performance. You guys all rock my world! Watched Spiderman 2 after it. Man, that's a good movie. A lot better than the first. Doc Oc kicked major ass.  [SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING, DON'T READ BELOW!]                 I wish Doc Oc didn't die. He was awesome. He really wasn't evil, just the tenticle-things wanted to carry out the experiment. That's why you shouldn't trust things with A.I.  Like in "I ROBOT" with Will Smith. That looks good, I want to see it pretty badly. Anyone want to see it with me?
