I attempt to look outside and see that the windows are completely frosted over.....and I quietly think to myself....."I have to walk and drive in this weather....I think not" Then I calmly role back over....bury my head in the pillow and wish it was saturday.  But alas I am being beckoned by the siren call of the evil alarm clock.....in a feeble attempt to disable the beast I pound mightely on the snooze bar...it drives the beast away for a time..but it returns with a vengence. I pound mercilessly on it agian....and yet it returns to taunt me. I in somewhat desperate straights actually look for the incredibly small of switch, the only breach in this evil beasts armor, I am successful...the hellion has been neutralized....just as I am about to role back over and claim victory...it occurs to me that the first class I would be missing is creastive writing taught by Sister Luke-murder-me-in-my-sleep-if-I-miss-class.   oh well.....time to get up I feel compelled to write. The problem is that I am not really sure what to write about. I have doubts about whether there is anyone even reading my blog... let alone that is of any use to anyone. But it does give a forum in which to spout my vast quantities of wisdom. (that would be sarcasm boys and girls...or as Will will know call it "the tearing of flesh").  Something that I have been thinking about recently.... I really need to connect more with my friends.  I see the evidence and fruit of the long-term friendships around me and realize that I have never had that. I really long for that type of friendship... and yet it is very difficult for me to open up or find people to open up to. Because of the life I have led before I find I still hold people at arms length... I tend to be too judgmental of people that frustrate me... even though the people that frustrate me the most are the ones I have the most in common with. There are times when even when I am with my “friends” I still feel like an outsider looking in, like I really don't belong there...like I am just tolerated because "They have to be nice to you". This causes me to push people away. The thing is… I know this is wrong... I know I have people in my life I can trust. Why are the lies so easy to believe sometimes? Well I have probably been to open about things here but... I don't know maybe there are some of you out there that have the same feelings... if you do...you are not alone. Someone has just very kindly got me a coffee from the vending machine. I then, (as I always do) transferred the coffee from the crap plastic cup into my mug. I took a sip. I turned green. My mouth was filled with the grimmest taste, like how I'd expect pure mould to taste, slightly bitter with a vomity undertone. It was clinging to my teeth and I could feel it's thick pungency overloading my tongue.  Because I'd just eaten an apple I wondered whether the sweetness was affecting my taste buds. You know, like the natural sugar and fruitiness wasn't lending itself to the fine Brazilian blend. So I asked two other people to taste the coffee, they both agreed to its mingingness. Just before I phoned reception to let them know that the vending machine was buggered I went to pour the coffee away. I then realized that when I had transferred the coffee between mugs I had done so without looking. I then remembered the wild mushroom soup I'd had mid-morning. I then remembered that I hadn't finished it. If anyone ever, ever, ever tries to make you drink espresso mixed with mushroom soup. Hit them. In the face. Very hard. Twice.  So here I sit with a bottle of Excedrin, a glass of water, Pepto-Bismol, and a pack of cigarettes. My head feels like there are gnomes inside it with pickaxes. My breath could burst into flames at any second...I'm almost scared to smoke. To top all this off, I've gotta go to school and my stomach is doing back flips.  Nah. Simple fact is, even with the list of phone numbers I've accrued and the beds I have waiting in a few seperate states and counties, I'd rather have have love. I'm sorry it didn't work out nothing does for me.  So, love is something I will try but I will do it differently.
