I planned to study Welsh a bit every day, and even planned to throw in Afrikaans, but even when I planned only about 15 minutes every day, it honestly is too much sometimes.           Work is mind numbing, and it is virtually impossible to stir it back to life after returning a la maison. I usually study Welsh each morning before going away to school or work, and sometimes even that time is better spend sleeping.           My Welsh is not improving much, in other words. In fact, no intellectual endeavour that I like to practice is at this time.     Reading     - writing - programming - language.  Full glottal stop. The splendour of a vicious circle.
