Their debate is not entirely based on fact.  While employing some fact to back up their argument, they supplement it with pure venomous vitriol for our war-time President.  This is not the way to have a mature debate.  The issue du jour with most liberals, and I suppose the entire nation, is Bush's execution of the war in Iraq.  I will always entertain the oppurtunity to have a lively discussion of issues, so long as they are pertinent to the debate.  Not "Bush is dumb" or "I can't believe he drug us into this war".  Where are the facts?  They sweep the facts under the bed like a child trying to make his room appear tidy.  The facts are this.  Bush is not dumb.  You are ignorant if you think that he is.  Plain and simple.  The man is educated from the posh prep school of Philips Exeter to Yale to Harvard business school.  Calling Bush dumb would be indicting these schools of educational malpractice.  The knee-jerk liberal reaction is to say that he only was granted admission because of his family name.  Fine, but if he was dumb how did he graduate?  Or why didn't both Bush daughters go to Yale and not just one?  I am sure that Jenna could have dropped her name to gain admission.  Liberals were always evasive about reports that supposedly Bush had better grades than Al Gore during their times in college, but I never hasten to make that argument because calling someone smarter than someone else is a regression to the Neanderthal argument that one can pitch a large stone further than the other.  Liberal knee-jerk reaction #2:  Well, if he isn't dumb why does he talk dumb?  Bush speaks in the parlance of the average American; the average American who doesn't use the word 'parlance' nor does he care to.  President Bush, like many Americans, believe that vocabulary doesn't make the man, but what makes the man are the decisions that he makes when they count most...which segways nicely into the next counter-intellectual argument that liberals make: the Iraq war.  "Bush drug us into the Iraq war!" they always say, usually alleging some sort of conspiracy to get their oil or calling this payback for the first President Bush.  Let's talk about the truth, for a change.  The truth is that the intelligence that Bush had was the same that President Clinton had before him.  This intelligence stated that Saddam had WMDs.  Bush presented this intelligence to Congress, who overwhelmingly voted to go to war based on said intelligence--Senator Kerry also supported the legislation.  No one ever talks about that.  Liberals like to say that Bush did this without any regard for anybody's opinion and just lead us senselessly into war.  Which is not true, because he sought and received near uniamimous approval from Congress...so I guess it wasn't just Bush that drug us into this war.  Now the liberals get nervous, because they know that you have them in a tough spot.  So they resort to the war for oil diatribe.  If the war was for oil, where is the Iraqi oil??  Why does it cost me $30 to fill up my Volkswagen?  Again, they get flustered.  "Well, it was just to get back at Saddam for the President's dad" they angerily say.  Again, wrong.  Bush 41, although not publicly against the war, dispatched his advisers like Scocroft and Fitzwater to speak for him against action in Iraq.  Now, the liberal is really mad.  "I hate Bush!" they resort to...  Now you have won the debate because their hate has defeated them.  The liberals let their hate erase things from their memory...9/11, pre-Iraq War, etc.  Argue the facts, don't argue emotion...it just isn't mature.
