Amazing how he can really do that even when theirs a ton of distractions everywhere in the room! but ne wayz! i got alot out of it! hmm after we left i was following Kayla and her mom! and people started flyin by us in the right lane! so i pulled over in the right and went from 45 to 50 and passed by Kayla and her mom and then that person in front of me idk if they slowed down or wat! cause i never went above 53 i no that for sure! and aught of a sudden someone named Kayla lol thinks that im really really speedin and thinks im tailgating a person and i didn't really! lol mean to ne way! it was that persons fault! lol! but ne wayz! then i went by my church and hung out for a lil while wit Josh and all! then i came home and now im here! which Kayla and her church are doin some lil trip thing idk wat it is about or ne thing but it sounds very interesting its called connected and its during November idk wat it is or ne thing except for wat it says and it barely says ne thing! like idk if everyone that was there know what the word Socket means i have no idea! idk but its a wed. thru sunday thing and im pretty interested! idk if im gonna go tho its 45 dollars if i turn in my registration before sept. which i dont even have that much money so idk! and i wouldn't feel right i guess if i went and i was with people that dont even wanna get to know me! i really dont understand people these days i wish people would be givin more courtesy! i mean if u dont no someone and their sittin next to u and they seem alone talk to em get to know their name and stuff! dont let them feel hated! Which everytime i go up to CWBC i feel rejected really cause noone will sit by ya if they dont no ya! and noone will talk to u if they dont know u! u wanna know how many people said hey to me today 3 the entire time! and thats cause they no me! but its 3 people that i dont see eye to eye wit 100%! i mean i sat in the middle of the room and was rejected noone sat around me! but it ended up being a very good thing cause i got alot out of tonite by that happening! But i mean c'mon guys lets not let people feel rejected all the time! BUT NE WAYZ with wat i was sayin! also See you at the pole is on Sept. 15th i believe! and theres this big Saw you at the pole thing at hinds comm. college and i wanna go! but i mean idk if it costs ne thing or not! and that sucks if it does cause im poor lol! i wanna go on both things! CONNECTED and Saw You At The Pole both sound really good! idk the bands that r gonna be there but the way people got hyped up about em they must be pretty good! Kayla says they r too! but idk! I jus dont like goin places that i dont know ne one! or when i do know someone but they dont wanna keep u from being alone and they dont care! but w/e i mean u all can do wat u want! i know what ive dun and im going to continue doing tho! well ima go now i guess! im bout tired of typin! and ive thot about it i might start openin my bible randomly and each day put one verse on here! i have quite a few people that read this and if i can jus get them to read a verse of the bible! even if its in this it will make God happy! idk if im gonna do this or not but its sounds cool to me! well ttyl! ALLOW GOD INTO YOUR HEARTS!!! L8erz Brent
