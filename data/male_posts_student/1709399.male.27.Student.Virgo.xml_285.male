" City of Dreams" , " City that never Sleeps" the epithets are abound about Mumbai and the city perhaps deserves most of it.Despite the crowds,the Infrastructure  vibrancy of the city amazes you.                                                It was great to meet most of my old friends after such a long time.The weather was great with mild rains and I made the most of my stay by traveling on the Local Trains and the BEST buses.Whatever people might say , this city bristles with life.
