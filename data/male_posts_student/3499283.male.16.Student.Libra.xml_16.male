After Sunday school I washed my car and shop vac-ed the sand and crap out of the seats and floor mats.  It looks a lot cleaner now, but I'm sure it won't take too long to dirty back up again.    Once again today we got a group of friends together and played basketball and beach volleyball at Stonebridge park, though today we didn't get ambushed by 5th graders.  They did make an appearance, but didn't come very close to us.    I have a feeling we will all be getting together at that park a lot this summer, and with all that basketball we should be ready for an IMBA debut, lol.  It'll be fun. Still need a name though..  I just saw Hugh Jackman shaking his arse in tight gold pants and pelvic thrusting on the Tony Awards..Yeah I can never watch X-Men again.  kelkey119: how's your night been? chadicus7: just fine, ive just been watching television and just ran to the bathroom to throw up when i saw wolverine pumping his pelvis on the tony awards kelkey119: i love hugh jackman! chadicus7: yeah NOW you do   I should work on more hw because I keep putting it off.  Peace  Chad
