I have been managing to handle life as it comes which is kind of surprising at times because they get kind of hairy.  I have summer classes all planned out.  I'm moving home for the summer and then maybe for next year.  Trying to get my life under control.  Start working out.  Stop smoking.  Just function like a normal well adjusted human being.  Ohh well.. FInals will be easy.  The semester is almost done.  Just looking for a nice little bit of rest.Hopefully it will come but you know what they say no rest for the weary.  Ohh yeah..  I'm about to buy a Car too so whats up..  Zeke has freedom of movement.  And then on to Formal this friday.  Open bar is such a great thing.  Ohh yeah and Aaron is coming down today so it will hopefully be a good week.   Hope everyone has a nice Cinco de Mayo, "La vida es muy confuso. "
