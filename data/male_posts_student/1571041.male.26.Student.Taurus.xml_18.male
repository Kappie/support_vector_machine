I write out some info on how they came about, but when I try to send them, nothing? I try to restart the whole thing and nothing again. I'm thinking it might be server problems, and @ worst, this computer I'm using.  So, I end up downloading the "Jesus Walks (remix)" from Kanye West featuring Mase. This isn't too different from the original, but they switch it up somewhat. I like it though. I'm not a church going person in anyway, but the things talked about in this song and the belief he shares with it is downright inspiring to me. I also like how it's somewhat militant too, but with a different message other than militant aggression. I seem to look and find I have a lot of Jesus songs or god songs, but also a lot of other songs too. Last I looked, I had 21 gigs of mp3's to work w/. Probably a lot more by now though, but I'll have to double check.  I would like to post those writtens up here, but things get too complicated in trying to do something like that. I like knowing where my works are being shown and who's seeing them. But, if you would like to see some samples of what I have, just email me @  urlLink windreamer@nativehiphop.net  = Subject:  What's up w/ the writtens?  Other than that, I just want some rest before things get started for tomorrow and I'm dead tired from not enough rest.  I got my Contacts in (The new prescription).  It's weird, to me, seeing everything in clear sight.  Usually I'm squinting around trying to read something, or just see it.  The crazy thing is, I have to use them on a fire, or mop up as it was today, instead of going somewhere or visting someone.  I'd rather have "good" eyesight to spot someone out of a crowd, or checking out something new to buy that was previously hard to see.  Also, I'm starting to yearn to see my li'l nephew now? Actually I always do, but most of the time I just pass it off as, " he'll be around sometime ," and try to work through it. This time though, I'm just wanting to hold him and try to make him do something he hasn't done before, or just see the things we don't get to see. Stupid work though, only giving me one day off a week, and stupid rest that is needed to be caught up on on my one day off. I think I'll have to make the 2 hour journey needed to see my neph neph at least for some hours, or even a day?
