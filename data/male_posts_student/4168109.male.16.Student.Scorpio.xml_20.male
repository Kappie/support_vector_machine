I caught myself twice about to utter the contemptible words--"I love you"--and stopped myself. The words just cascade out of my mouth when I'm talking to her. I think the only thing that can help me now is shock therapy. Maybe sending a shudder of electricity to my brain whenever I mutter the word  love  will fix my problem. But then what about  glove, all of, luff, belove ...will those words be lost as well? Shit--my acting career will go nowhere without those precious words.      I finally watched  Once Upon a Time in Mexico --the third installment in the El Mariachi series, perhaps Mexico's largest (and only?) movie franchise to make it in our Great Country. Johnny Depp loses his eyes and says "fuck-mook", and Mickey Rourke practically strangles a chihuahua through the entire movie--so if you haven't seen it, it's well worth the five bucks to rent a copy.      In other news, the Discovery Channel is sleazy and distasteful. I was watching a program on squids early this morning, minding my own business [ urlLink 1 ], and this "scientist"-guy (probably just some male whore the Discovery Channel hired to wear a lab coat) was talking about squid mating habits and such [ urlLink 2 ]. According to whore-scientist, within the male squid's ten tentacles, one of them is, well, the squid's  trousersnake  (I mean, uh, tentaclesnake). When the male wishes to reproduce, he basically slaps his thang in the female and releases sperm stuff and the female has her babies or whatever [ urlLink 3 ]. So, this guy is talking about squids and how he found one--dead, male--in its peak of squid puberty. Now for the horrifying part. This creep then proceeds to pick up the squid's dong and (here it is)  squeezes  it, thus forcing squid spoogies all over the motherfucking table. That's only the half of it! After this "scientist" force ejaculates this  dead  squid, he up and puts his hands all in the  squid sperm ! [ urlLink 4 ]      [ urlLink 5 ]         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...
