I had always thought that Kevin's mother was scary and that I will not have that much to talk to her about.  You know, one of those feelings one gets from an adult that one isn't too sure of.  She scared me as an overly sarcastic person as well as a critical person too.  When she said once "Oh, look at Dennis driving.  Isn't he so cool?" it was weird.  Also, whenever I needed a ride from any place in the past, I heard Kevin re-enact his mother with an exasperated tone such as "Fine, we'll drive him home." and I always felt like a burden and bad for not having a ride in the first place.  But anyway, as I was travelling around, trying to get my little brother to sleep, I decided that it wouldn't hurt to give Kevin a visit.  Well, Kevin was out with his father shopping or something and Mrs. O'brien and C.J. were the only ones home.  C.J. was funny.  Funny kid.  Anyway, Mrs. O'brien inquired why I wasn't at the prom.  Well, I've been telling people that I couldn't go because my parents weren't home.  And I left it at that.  Well, "Where are your parents?"  They were in California. "Why?" My mother is going to work there for three months.  My father just went over to help her get settled. "Oh."  Yea, my mother has half a mind to move there.  "Oh, thats too bad.  Dennis, you're not allowed to move."  Well, I told my mom that.  If we do move then I'm not moving.  I'm staying here because this is where my life is.  "I understand.  I like it here too."  Blah blah blah.  "You know Dennis, if anything I think you'll have no trouble finding people to stay with if you parents move.  I mean, it'll only be a few months as you're gonna just finish your high school year.  I'm sure there are many people who would be happy to have you with them."  Yea, I might live with my Aunt if we do move although I don't like her that much.  C.J. said something like, "He could stay in our basement."    "Yea, we just cleaned it out" said Mrs. O'brien. "It'll only be for a few months.  You're not allowed to move across the country."  Well, I said something about it being weird to live with my friends.  The relationship with my friend once I move in with them would grow on a more personal level and some parts of that makes me uncomfortable.  I barely have any personal relationship with my family as it is now, I don't know if I would be too willing to have a personal relationship with any of my friends.  By which i mean, with all of my friends I have a good relationship.  With some of them, I can trust them with my secrets and vice versa.  But if I do live with them, I'm sure they'll know all of my secrets which makes me feel defenseless, you know?  Its like when we were kids and we had a "secret place" where no one knew about.  Were our imaginary friends resided and we had all the time in the world to do whatever and catch bad guys.  I think secrets are like this "secret place".  Once I share it with someone, it'll no longer be a secret place.  It'll be a shared place.  Which is entirely different.  But I'm sure it won't be too bad.  I hope that didn't sound too offensive to anyone.  Seriously.  Anyway, I don't know if my mother would want to move anyway.  I don't think she would.  She likes this house too much.  But what Mrs. O'brien said to me, it made me feel good and wanted.  I had always had a kind of aversion to her, but now its almost completely gone and in its wake is the warmth of acceptence.  Well, maybe not acceptence or anything like that, but its a nice feeling nonetheless.  So I stopped worrying about the future.  What will be will be.  And if worse comes to worse, I'll have one good option to look into.  I don't care what Kevin says, his mother has the final ruling.  Ha.   Other than that, nothing much.  The book I'm reading right now is titled Complications by Atul Gawande.  I have a feeling he's Indian.  Anyway, its such an interesting book.  You know how sometimes mystery novels or action novels make your heart race and you want to read as fast as possible to find out what happens?  This book is like that only that its non-fiction.  Dr. Gawande describes how his first day of Residence went.  He had to place a line in a large aretery near the heart using a huge needle through the chest.  The specifics aren't clear or understood by me but I got the general gist.  Anyway, it was nerve wrecking for me but more so for him.  He had to hold a large needle and drive it in a patient's chest and draw blood to confirm he was in the right place.  He had no x-ray to guide him.  He only had a demostration earlier.  He utlimately failed and his supervisor took over.  However, he does bring up a good point:  Medicine is a Practice.  Nothing in medicine is book regulated and perfect.  Its mostly a guess then check.  When a person is wheeled into an emergency room, the doctor doesn't have enough time to go to a text book and check what he should do.  The doctor has to act now to stablize the patient then check to see if he did the right thing.  If not, fix it or learn from it.  A real good quote for doctors, especially surgeons: "You can be wrong, but never be undecisive."  Although I'm not halfway through the book yet, it just confirms why I think Medicine is such a wonderful area.  Its the action and the adrenaline that makes it so worthwhile.  And its the gratitude of the patients that makes it sweet.  I'll read more and tell you what I think.  Thats all for now, I guess.  I don't think I have anything more to say.  Oh yea, I took $60 from my mother.  I don't think she minds.  She did ruin my Junior Prom night.  I do love her though.  My dad just remembered that I'm going out tomorrow night to see bands and he offered to pay for it.  I told him that I already did years ago and he said he'll pay me back.  I told him it was okay.  I kinda felt guilty for taking out $60 from my mother, but I'm sure she knows already since I did tell her that I was going to.  Hmm...whats a teenager to do with $60?  Maybe I'll by some weed.    Nah, maybe a good CD.  Happy Trails.
