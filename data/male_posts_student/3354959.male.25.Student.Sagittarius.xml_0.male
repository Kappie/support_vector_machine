Of all the guys they could have gotten, is he really the best one to make people want to watch hockey? The sport is floundering, people. The league might not exist next season. Is a spot featuring Bill (or was it Ted?) really going to sell a bunch of skeptical Americans on the fact that hockey is a legit sport and should be considered so? I realize that Keanu is Canadian, and as such, he commands a certain innate respect. But is he really the best Canadian for the job? Was Alanis Morrisette too busy? Were the Barenaked Ladies on tour or something?  urlLink Here's  a whole list of other people who could have done the job.   I think the next step is to get Trinity to do some spots for women's soccer.
