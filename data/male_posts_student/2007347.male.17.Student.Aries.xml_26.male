You owe me 5 fathings say the bells of St. martins when will you pay me say the bells of Old Bailey When I grow rich say the bells of Shoredich. When will that be say the bells of Stepney. Im sure i dont know says the great bell at Bow.   Here comes a candle to light you to bed. Here comes a Chopper to chop off your head chip, chop, chip chop. the last man's head..."  There a game to this song, which I cant remember. I can't expect anyone to know this rhyme.. Its all about London church bells...
