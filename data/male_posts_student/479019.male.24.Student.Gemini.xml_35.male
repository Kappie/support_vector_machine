Still no word from UCSB. The anxiety is killing me!  I also have to do 3 papers by next next Monday. 2 two page papers and one 5 pager. I might have to do an addition 5 page paper in 2 Wednesdays, but it depends on what I get on my last paper.  Finals is also coming up. Life is mighty stressful right now. Hopefully I get to get out and have some fun tomorrow.  *
