Awesome job by Tank with his "balls" joke and calling that guy a girl.  Then after the assembly the fire alarm got pulled so everyone didn't have to go back to class.  Then in 3rd period there was no test like there was supposed to be so they just played a game and Tyke was the LEADER of the game and he made his own rules and was a Nazi about enforcing them.  In 4th period Purdy helped to get them out of class 15 minutes early without the teacher knowing so Tyke, etc. went to Burger King for a nice long lunch.  It was great.  5th period was nothing and 6th period was pretty good.  After school Tyke stayed after to help put up decorations for the Senior Class' hallway.  It was pretty fun even though he got yelled at 2ice.  First by Ms. McGinnis and then by Ms. Foote because he had the key to open all of the doors to the school and probably wasn't supposed to.  BUT IT WAS SOOOO COOL!  Haras was hanging up decorations and stuff too but unfortunately she and Tyke didn't really talk much.  Mainly cuz Tyke and Purdy left early and went up to Farget's.  It was cool just hanging out and shopping a little.  Then Purdy went home and Tyke came home and did some cleaning and played Madden.  Then Macaroon, Amed, Flamingo, and Skippy came over and they played Halo and Madden.  Halo is still so much fun to play.  Halo 2 with 4-player cooperative is going to be perhaps the coolest thing ever.  And then 16 person online will be sick too.  But so would a really cool girl to hang out with.  That would be very cool too.  Like maybe Tina.  Her senior picture is soooooooooooooooo good.  It is on Tyke's monitor and it really makes him weak looking at it.  She is so beautiful and angelic.  So sweet and innocent.  So perfect.  But that is not possible.  Perfection is imperfect.  And hopefully Tyke isn't just hoping that she is the girl he wants her to be but who knows right now.  And really it doesn't matter because right now there is nothing between them so there is nothing to worry about.  Life is good.  Goodnight all.
