It has finally began, and therefore I won't go into my reasons for why they should or should not do, I have been putting off writing them as a matter of fact. And frankly it doesn’t matter anymore now.  What matters is to pray for the fastest and best resolution to this situation. May God watch over those who are involved, on both sides and  especially  the ones caught in the middle.   May God forgive us all.
