I in no way, sahpe, or form, take credit for this entry, all i do is keep a "back-up" incase the other site goes down for some reason.         The Seven Deadly Sins 	 	  Hello, new people! There are quite a lot of you, so greetings and salutations. Don't be strangers.  I have been making huge, thoughtful entries lately. So, today, as per scathedobsidian 's suggestion, I present you with the fun instead of the cerebral. I give you:  The Seven Sins of Blogging     1. Thou shalt not post quiz results.  No one cares. It takes precious time to load those images and there are only about 1.5 souls in all of Livejournal that give a crap that you are a pervy Ewok fancier. If you must post quiz results, stick with the small image/short blurb ones and put them behind cuts. The long answers inevitably paired with drawings that look like they were done by a 14 year old who mainlines glitter like heroine and masturbates to Lady Cottington's Pocket Pressed Fairy Book, the answers which masquerade as content, are punishable by a week in the stocks. We all take them. But don't inflict them on others, public torture is against the Geneva Convention. It's nice that your true heart is made of crystal. Mine is made of angry, angry iron smelted by large Russians who still believe in the Workers' Revolution. We will crush you.      2. Thou shalt not mangle the English language.  OMG! LoTR iS teH sHIznIT! I hereby declare holy crusade against you and will shortly arrive at your door eager to get Byzantine on your ass. English is a beautiful language, spoken by kings and poets, pioneers and monks. Do not treat it like a cheap slut you can impregnate with your mewling bastards. Capitalize only proper nouns and the first letters of sentences. Discover the spell check option. Control your instinct toward acronyms. The words are "boy" and "girl." Ever is not spelled with an A. T and H are very good friends. They want to stay together always, and make mad consonant love whenever they can. Do not insert E, the nefarious vowel, into their pure and holy love--it belongs at the end. If you are, in fact, 12 years of age, try to cover this fact by writing in a way which does not make anyone older than you cram a barbecue fork into their skull and scramble their eyeballs like Sunday eggs. Expressions of fannish joy placed within asterisks (*squee*) are a subset of this sin, and only acceptable when used in moderation--but when coupled with a hot pink layout and icons featuring Legolas, incure the sentence of death by pressing.     3. Thou shalt not post IM conversations.  No one cares. Remember when you last smoked pot/got drunk, and you thought you were saying some really amazingly deep things, plumbing the depths of universal truths with a sense of wit and humor to which Falstaff himself would doff his cap? Yeah, you didn't. You told your mom's book club buddy that her legs were the word, and she should spread the word, then vomited all over her turquoise Kathie Lee Collection pantsuit. Your IM conversatons are only interesting to you and the other person involved. We do not know you all that well, much less do we know who CraKHed756 is, and why you would feel the need to discuss the ramifications of the current socio-political situation on ferrets. IM conversations are private. Keep them that way, for the love of god. If there is any erotic content to said conversation, this is an especially apt warning. Do not forget the Angry Russians.     4. Thou shalt not post large pictures of thyself or others without using Ye Holy LJ-Cut.  Yea verily, a whole group of sins involve not indulging in the magnanimous LJ-Cut (or equivalent linking technique, for non-LJ blogs) when it desperately calls out for use. Large pictures of your vacation, your mug, your dog, your mom, the turquoise pantsuit, your boss schtupping the security guard in the Comedy/Family section of Blockbuster, your house, your goiter, George Bush in amusing poses, or any other image larger than a gaggle of icons have no place outside of the LJ-cut fence. Not everyone has delicious and nutritious Japanese broadband access like I do. They take precious time to load, time which brings us all closer to death. Multiple pictures only compound your sin in the eyes of the Almighty Server.  5. Thou shalt not under any circumstances, post poetry without a cut.  Particularly if you are the sort of manic little howler monkey that feels the need to cross-post a poem to several communities, for the love of all that is good, please LJ-cut your six-part epic on angst, death, tears, self-cutting, and how black is the dawn when Daddy won't buy you an iPod. Even if your poetry is good, it angers the reader to have to scroll through it a dozen times. Poetry is longer than prose, because it's in a column. It takes up huge amounts of room if it's posted once. And I, humble reader, will let you in on a secret. 95% of readers scroll right on by the second they see a column. You will get less comments on a poem than on the Ewok fancier quiz, even if the poem is brilliant. A blank entry will get you more comments. So posting it in full does nothing but annoy. It does not force people to read your Slytherin limerick fest. Cross-posting will only make anyone who might have told you what you wanted to hear stab their screen repeatedly. An LJ-cut will make you appear considerate and mature, which will entice a few to read your opus. A few is about the best you will get. Embrace cuts. Cuts are your friends. You don't want to hurt your friends, do you?     6. Thou shalt not get creative with font colors.  This makes me feel like I ate bad mushrooms at a chili-cook off hosted by Pennywise the Clown. If it sparkles, dances, or magically changes color in mid-sentence, I will find you and break off your hands at the wrists to use as lawn ornaments at Christmastide. The human eye can only take so much before it spontaneously liquefies. If I feel an epileptic fit coming on and my golden retriever runs for the leather bit to keep me from biting off my own tongue as I jerk and gibber in the magenta light of your neon words, you will find yourself beset by karmic locusts within the week. If the subject matter of your Rainbow-Brite text involves boys, the unfairness of your parents, or Orlando Bloom, they will be joined by biting red ants. You're not making your site more visually interesting, you're making yourself appear color blind and/or severely retarded.     7. Thou shalt not act like an ass.  You are not the next Napoleon. Just because you have 150 friends-of does not mean you are well on your way to world domination and cultural saturation. Your personal turns-of-phrase are not on the brink of common use on MTV. You are not going to grow up to create Plato's Republic on an island in the sea. You are not Joe Cool. You are not the lord anyone's god. You are a very small person with sweaty hands and a prescription for Paxil clutched in your prehensile toes. Neither are you Edgar Allen Poe or Tom Paine, William Butler Yeats or Jack Kerouac. Your goth statements of Dark Glory and Destruction, Political Commentary for Those Who Already Agree, Epic Poetry on the Subject of Your Bitch-Monster Ex, and Edgy Sex Adventures just make you a slightly frog-like creature who spends too much time online, not the next Great Man. Telling others of your majesty will not help. Standing up in your blog and shaking your Kong-like fists at the virtual sky while hollering I AM KIROK!  at the top of your cyber-voice might scare a few wandering Google robots into your burgeoning fold, but the rest of us will yawn and belch in your general direction. Blessed are those with perspective.  We've all done most of them, at some point or another, to some degree or another. Sinning is the Official Past-time of Humanity. Thusly, I say unto you, O Pilgrims, have ye never sinned?
