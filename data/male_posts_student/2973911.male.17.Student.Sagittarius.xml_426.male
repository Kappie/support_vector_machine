The thing is, there are alot of Flipz (slang for Filipinos like me), albeit asians as a whole, in our area. And coffee starts off our social morning. Now about Tullys, the only Tullys I know of is a merchandising/wholesale store just like Walmart.   Rox,  I know of a way of downloading mp3's without downloading those Ad-infested/virus infested  I- Mesh or Kazaa Mp3 players/dls. The problem is, it isn't a website, but a program. but still, both the program  mp3 are free (at least I think it is). You can even download animes such as Dragonball  Ranma if you're really diligent... Generally, a song has 3-6 megabytes to fill ur disk drive, so u better have decided if downloading songs is what u really want though. But I think you already have your own mp3 collection. I tell ya, I got addicted in downloading mp3's up to this day. Though anyway, wouldn't it be cool if you a bought a portable mp3 player to fit in ur pocket (u can transfer mp3's from comp. to the player). So much for piracy, hahahaha. They can't stop me, Mwahahahaha!!! Dammit', I'm so rowdy.   Miah,  When are you supposedly be online? I wanna talk to mi amigo sometime.
