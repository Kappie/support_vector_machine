One little girl said that grass is definately green. The teacher then corrected her by saying that dead grass is brown, and thier is also kentucky blue grass. Another little girl said tthe sky is definately blue. The teacher then corrected her saying that the sky is gray when it rains and black at night. The finnaly a little boy asked if farts were chunky. The disgusted teacher replyed no. And then the little boy said: Then I  definately  just crapped my pants!
