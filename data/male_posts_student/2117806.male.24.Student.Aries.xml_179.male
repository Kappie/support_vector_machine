It's starting to make me feel kinda old, y'know?  I'm starting to feel restless again.  I want to go somewhere, be somewhere else.  Anywhere but here.  Dunno how I'd get there, or what I'd do when I got there, or how I'd afford to take a road trip at this point, but I have the urge to leave this town and not return for a while.  I'll probably just go home and play video games instead, though.  I've already got those.  In other news, I'm hungry, 'cause I haven't eaten yet today, and I've been awake since 9.00 am.  Good thing I get off work in half an hour.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Neil Young, "Are you ready for the country?"
