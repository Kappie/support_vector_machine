Maybe I should pop a half dozen or so ambiens and hope to be knocked out til noon, at which time my dad (who got in last night by the way) is wanting to go shopping for barstools for the new townhome. Grace said she'll be driving back up tomorrow morning since they got to see the fortune teller a day early or whatever. Apparently this mystical being knew her boyfriend (that would be me) was born in 1979, looks like his mom, and has been having trouble sleeping the last few weeks. Lucky guess. I also love her very much, am going to be very successful, and will be having back problems if I don't watch it. Oh and I'm kind of lazy right now and need to shape up. Sure whatever. I think it's all just a bunch of tomfoolery (heehee that's a funny word) but at least Grace is happy now, knowing that her boyfriend does indeed love her very very much (hey the guy said it so it must be true). God I'm such an ass  .      I tried to call Tay again earlier tonight. Honestly, why do I even bother? I wish I could step inside her head for just a few seconds to try and understand why she's acting and feeling the way she is. I just don't get it. I know I said some hurtful things a while back, but how could she just completely turn her back to me? How can she not realize how much I'm hurting right now and that I really need my friends and family. I don't get why she can't talk to me anymore. We've been through so much together..who else has been as close to her the last few years? Yet now she says she can't talk to me and that she needs her space. I have my own ideas as to why she's acting this way, but I'll keep them to myself. Right now all I know is that I miss her. I miss her a lot. It's like suddenly losing your best friend one day, and not knowing why. The other day I saw some pics of her out dancing on bars and hanging on guys. I guess this is the new wild and crazy Tay. I admit those pics made me a little jealous, but only because of the fact that those guys actually got to be around her. I'm supposed to be the best friend, yet over the past several months there just never seemed to be any time for me.      I can't wait to see Grace tomorrow. Sure I'll give her shit for "leaving me" to go see that damn fortune teller, but I'm so glad she's coming back a day early. It's pretty sickening how much we miss each other after just one day. I can just imagine everyone gagging right about now..and rightfully so. Fuckers. It's been nearly two years and yet it's like we get more and more disgustingly in love as each day goes by. But the real sick part is the fact that I don't think that's ever going to change. Yea we're sick bastards. Ok, t  ime for another ambien..
