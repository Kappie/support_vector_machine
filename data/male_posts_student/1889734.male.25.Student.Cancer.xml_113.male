Don sent me an email this morning that I'll get to shortly, but in it, he mentions that he has been reading Shogun since May.  I couldn't resist mocking him.  I recall the TV series in 1980, but my memory is fuzzy.  I recall it being good, but it was made in 1980 and I was 11.  So I probably wouldn't want to watch it again.  I confess I've never read it, but I do have a copy in my collection.  Maybe I'll dig it out sometime.
