The question is, which side is right?  How about neither?  We're locked in a war on terror.  A global conflict between the United States and those individuals and groups around the world that wish to hurt either America or its allies.  Of course, Bush has a little convoluted view on exactly what is harmful to America and what isn't.  Afghanistan was the first logical choice, as it was the last known 'resort' for the world's leader in terrorism at the time of the September 11th attacks, Osama bin Laden.  But, that witchhunt wasn't just a witchhunt, it was a full-on invasion of a sovereign nation.  The basis for these attacks: to limit terrorism and its supporters around the globe.  But, invasion of a sovereign nation without due proof that it is involved in any offensive strikes against the nation is imperialistic plain and simple.  Implementing freedom on that populace from a oppressive regime is all well and good, but don't do so under the guise of terror.  Do it under the guise of spreading freedom and democracy to the world.  There is a large difference between the two.  Now, fast forward a bit to another very similar instance: the unprovoked invasion of the sovereign nation, namely to oust the oppressive dictator Saddam Hussein, accused by the CIA and Russian president Vladimir Putin as having "weapons of mass destruction", and harbouring terrorists.  Once again, this is all well and good when you have the proof.  Unfortunately, the United States, and their cowboy president George Bush, did not.  What we do know is that Iraq  had  "weapons of mass destruction", having acquired them through various means through his two-decade-plus rule.  The United Nations aknowledged the fact that they had them, and after a resolution, ordered Saddam Hussein to dismantle and destroy them in a timely and safe fashion while providing proof of this.  Hussein of course claimed he followed the orders of the United Nations resolution, but why did he fail to offer proof?  Hans Blix and crew soon rolled into Iraq with their little convoy of Landrovers on a tour of the country in a search for these weapons.  Periods of time past, and still no weapons were found.  The weapons that had definitely been there had suddenly disappeared, and with no trace as to where they went.  George Bush wasn't as patient as the United Nations.  In rushed the United States military, claiming once again that they were routing Iraq under the guise of "terrorism".  Once again, a sovereign nation was under assault by the most powerful country in the entire world.  Supporters cried out once again that they were "liberating" the country from the grip of "dictatorship", but the truth was, the United States was taking care of unfinished business from over a decade earlier, and removing weapons that were  potentially  hazardous to their allies like Kuwait and possibly Israel.  The war raged on, and lies spewed forth from its opposers.  According to them, the United States was in a quagmire.  Indeed, a quagmire so quick that within months the Iraqis went from oppressed to trouncing through the streets, defacing the remants of Iraq's former dictator.  But, like every country that had ever been converted from an authoritarian regime to a government based upon the principles of democracy, Iraq would take time.  The crime rate rose, troupes of Saddam supporters continued their defensive combat for the country, and people discounted the prospects of democracy in Iraq.  All the while, the military failed to find these "weapons of mass destruction".  Sure, there were evidences of Saddam's disregard for the U.N. resolutions like SCUD missiles.  Now, the majority of America is opposed to the war effort in Iraq.  It started as a much smaller movement, led with a front of pacifists and neo-hippies.  But, the support for the war has floundered, dropping little by little each month.  Now, according to  urlLink this article  by Channel NewsAsia, an international news website, "fifty-two percent of Americans believe the Iraq war was not worth fighting."  Not a large margin, but still a majority.  But, one fact has still been with held from the general population, in light of the 9-11 Commissions findings: the fact that two cases of "weapons of mass destruction" were discovered in Iraq, as evidenced by  urlLink this article  by WorldNetDaily.  The story, which has gained only minimal media support, is actually rather damning to the cries that this war to find "weapons of mass destruction" was misguided, and that the American public was lied to.  One of the attacks was a bomb explosion in which the bomb contained sarin nerve agent; the other was a mustard gas shell used as part of a improvised explosive device.  The shell is believed to be one of the 550 of the like that Hussein failed to account for to the United Nations.  So, in all of this, where does the blaim lie?  How about blaiming both sides?  The truth is, even though the United States, with president Bush at the helm, was write about "weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq, and possibly these sketchy ties between Hussein and members of Islamic-extremist terrorist groups, the United States has failed to show in any remarkable way how Iraq was a "terrorist" country, and was in any way going to participate in an attack against the United States or its allies.  If the United States is going to route this mindset from the region, and remove these sadistic murderers, they need to focus less on the sovereign nations and focus more on the cat-and-mouse tactics for finding the real enemy -- the terrorists.  War between two sovereign nations is a much different case than one nation tracking down those responsible for the murder of almost three thousand individuals on September 11th, and those responsible for numerous other barbaric murders around the region against "infidels" such as Jews, Americans, and even now a Korean.  But, on the other side lies the political slant and media bias in America towards the Democratic view of things.  The Democrats are outspoken against this war, and anything that appears to be going bad in it will undoubtedly help their presidentail candidate, John Kerry, in the upcoming elections.  The fact that the major media and news networks overlooked or disregarded just about everything pro-America and pro-war both in Iraq and this country, coupled with this dismissal of blatant illegal chemical weapons in Iraq proves just how far they will go to put their man in office.  So, to finally tie this thing up, I suppose the only conclusion I can give any of you is that neither George Bush, nor John Kerry deserve your vote.  In fact, I can't find one candidate who would serve this country well.  But, like I plan on doing with every one of these posts, I'll provide you with both a thoughtful and related quote, this one by Henry Steele Commager: "Men in authority will always think that criticism of their policies is dangerous. They will always equate their policies with patriotism, and find criticism subversive."
