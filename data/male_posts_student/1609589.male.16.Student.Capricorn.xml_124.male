Well, it's long enough.  Disclaimer- These were thought of over the course of a month, so none of them are related. The entries in quotation marks were not said by me. Some of these thoughts were just for me, some were inside jokes, but i think you'll get a good number of them. here you go- random thoughts, month 1.    -I think Cap'n Crunch promotes destruction of property.  -I don't associate myself with people that tYpE EvERy woRd LiKe ThIs RoFl StFu!!!!  -I like jazz music, but I can only take it in small doses.  -Buttered toast = happiness.  -Canada.  -I can't be a Blue Man because I don't smoke.  -"Sometimes I say 'Shit.'"  -My brother's friends know to stay away from me. ~backhands palm~  -"It really doesn't say much for the human race when the transsexual is the best looking woman in the room."  -Canadia.  -Boom...

End.
