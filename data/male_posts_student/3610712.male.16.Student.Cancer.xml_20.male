Sarah got back from Lake San Antonio on Friday night, so naturally we were going to go have some fun the next day. Yesterday we went to Eric's, where we played like four Tool songs, before ending due to hunger. Then we went to Subway and Mr. Taco, followed by Cindy's house to eat. After we ate, we went back to Eric's to pick up equipment and stuff. Then I drove Luke to his hotel and he got ready for his quasi-date with Yamina. So then I drove him to Yamina's, then we drove to the beach. Sarah and I walked around while Luke and Yamina sat in one of the enclosures at the train station. After awhile, we went to Southside. Sarah and I drank Italian Cream Sodas while Luke inquired about what it takes to gig at that venue. After that, I took Yamina and Luke home. By that time it was about 9:15, so Sarah and I decided to go see "The Village." It was pretty good overall, I think. And that is all for now. Goodbye.
