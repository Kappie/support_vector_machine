Sleeping: 9pm ~ 3am Waking  : 5am ~ 2pm (explanation: one day i could sleep at 9pm, the other maybe 11pm or maybe 3am... same for the waking time...)  my sleeping and waking time varies too much liao... and when i could get a proper... i would always woke up cuz of external factors... something like raining (yesterday), my bro playing com (the day before...) or mosquitoes...  and wat's worse... i'm actually feeling sleepy as i type the post...  (P.S.: i'm planning to buy a notebook soon... anyone got a good suggestion... ?)
