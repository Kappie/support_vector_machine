Â¿wAdEvA~!  at night went to stay over at yiyong's hse 2 watch e final of euro. 13ppl and his brother stared at e flickering tv screen at an unearthly hour to watch 22 men chasing after a ball; things jus could not get more exciting than this. and everyone's heart sank xcept me and wei xiang when angelos charisteas nodded in e winner. we could hear all e cursing arnd and e most upset was bryan in his portugal jersey, stoning in front of e tv. but 4 me e wierd part of e nite began jus b4 e match.  sumhow while we were talking trash, e topic came to be abt ghosts and e supernatural. premunitions was one of e things discussed. remember when sum1 seemed 2 haf said sumthing b4 and u jus noe wad he'll sae next? or e time when u jus noe where ur frens would sit at a table, jus like e way u saw in a dream? well, after e match we all went up to yy's room to crash. in e middle of our sleep, i received a msg frm my fren saying sum shit bout e match. i read it and deleted it. but e thing was tt when i woke up at arnd 8+, i had a new msg. e exact same one frm my fren. as i'm quite a light sleeper and my ringtone would prob wake everyone up in e room. so i was kinda freaked esp since i remembered readin and deletin it. maybe i remembered wrong...
