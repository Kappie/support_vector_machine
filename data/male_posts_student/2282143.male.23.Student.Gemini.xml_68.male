Basically, our department head is cutting management and taking over motor safari.  Jullee was offered a position, but would not have any say whatsoever in the management process.  There are many other reasons for leaving, like health reasons, but I dont blame her for leaving.  It just sucks that after 25 years of loyal service to the zoo, it ends like this.  Welcome to the corporate world, huh?  Mariann also got booted to admissions, reduced to counting out cash boxes after the day ends.  I came back to the zoo for them, and now my reason to be there is gone.  Therefore, I am gone.  But this doesnt mean right now.  Jullee leaves the 17th.  Everyone else is boycotting this move and plans on leaving when she does.  I am with them.  Although, like I said, not right now.  I still need a job until I get out of school in June.  Then, Im off to start my living as a full time CNA at a hospital (instead of part time CNA, part time MS).  Who knows where yet, but mid-May after I get my official certification, I will start job hunting.  That just blows though.    Secondly, I think my black belt certificate is a fake.  I have my reasons, but I also dont want to make wild accusations.  There is just so much shit going on at the international level.  Head honcho of the WTF got busted on corruption charges in Korea.  Getting to be way too political.  But four years of my life wasted?  But I think of the physical and spiritual gains I have made and it makes me not give a damn about a piece of paper.  Oh well.    So my life has fallen apart this past week, and Im only anticipating it getting worse.  Happy Good Friday.
