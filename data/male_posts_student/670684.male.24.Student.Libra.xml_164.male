So I'm here at Spiderhouse Cafe,  urlLink writing a review  of a documentary I just saw,  urlLink Hecho A Mano:  Tres Historias de Guatemala .    Between outbursts of gainful work betwixt hours of grabass, Clare, the sound engineer on my first short project about debating, mentioned a Johnny Cash cover of Nine Inch Nails' HURT.  Cash has been a favorite of mine since 1997, when I first listened U2's  urlLink Zooropa  (he provided lead vocals for  The Wanderer ) during make-out sessions with Melia Woods.  The love for Melia was short-lived, but I still go to bed with the Cash man on a nightly basis.  This love was reaffirmed when Stig Nielsen, Centenary's greatest drunken Danish exchange student, sang three Cash songs at a talent show in 2001.  This was before he fell through the ceiling of Cline Hall after exploring the attic.    So I hooked up to  urlLink launch.com  and had a gander at the video.    I was floored.    I think Cash is a great singer in the many genres he has surfaced in.  But this song's simple refrains and chords turn into such complexities when Cash provides his despondent, soulless vocals.  Cash looks less like the hunk he was known as in Dukes of Hazzard circles and more like a modern-day Kirk Douglas, which accentuates the difference between the Cash then and the Cash now.  I wish I knew more and had the time to really talk about this, because it is truly amazing.    I heard the song before I saw the video.  I loved the song by itself.  With the video, it is more than incredible.    Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor.  Me and little brother shared my empire.  of dirt.     MORE:  Who knew MTV would be a  urlLink source for Johnny Cash news ?  MSN.com's usually poorly-written urlLink Slate  magazine talks about Cash too.  And a  urlLink blog reference  that is better written than anything I'd produce.    FYI, I've spent the past two hours looking at this and listening to Hurt.  I don't know who doesn't know about this, but it is one of the most amazing songs I've ever heard.  And it is a cover.  Incredible.
