Movies galore, but stayed in his room most of the time, so there was in reality one movie.  Well, for me anyway, because I left early.  Is it my fault I would like to pretend to be studious once in a while??  It makes me feel important and speeecial!  Hope the rest of you peoples enjoyed the rest of the night!
