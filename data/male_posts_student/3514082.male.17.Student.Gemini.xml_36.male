Very geeeky, and just me tim, sean chris and jake but it was great (sam is away round beckys). Havent really done much else today apart from things around the house. I only woke up at about 1300 today after Hannah's party last night. It was a cool party with loads of sheringham blokes there who were all quite nice chaps. I think there was one Sheringham girl there (shows Hannahs priorities). Anna got with someone, what a surprise! (i give it a week that seems to be the average with her). got to go some one is awake   alex
