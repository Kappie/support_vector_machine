I then found out that i didn't have practise today. by this time it was too late to alter or make plans with Chloe :( i was bummed out.      I then went to my room and played Eternal Darkness, with the sound on FULL BLAST !!! it's such a cool game ! Then i played some other games, came downstairs to find none other then flashy looking Jimbo Medd at the door, looking Fine in Brown. It was nice to see him as i aint seen him in a while, he couldn't stay long .. we was just popping over to pick up our Demo C.D to be posted to Mercury Records.      Then i had tea, BBQ ! (That caught on fire) .. I then ended my night comming on the computer while watching Big Brother (Stu And Michelle, Rumpy Pumpy) .. and staying on the Big Brother chat room trying to get Ahmed to answer my question .. WHICH HE DID !!! here is a pic link : http://www.whahay.net/pubaccess/AHMED.PNG      Can't wait to see chloe tommorow, feels like i havent in ages.
