I will not dispute the quality of the music on the CD as great names grace the production such as Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses; I do dispute the encumbrances that the record companies have thrown onto the CD.  For those not aware, this CD has a copy protection mechanism embedded in it.  For those light on the technology, I will keep things simple: "you cannot make mp3's from this CD".  That's right, you can only play in your CD player just like goodie-goodie consumer the record companies want us to be.  Have an IPOD, guess what, you are SOL.  What's that you say, you want to play the music you bought on another device such as a rare thingamajig called a mp3 player  ( scoffs )?  Well, according to the record industry, you better get a Itunes account and pay for another copy cause you are also SOL.  What's that, what if you dare encode your music in another format such as  urlLink ogg vorbis , like myself ( scoffs twice )?  Well you are totally f*cked cause the intent of this copy protection scheme is to halt that type of use.      You might ask what can the 4 people who read Jack's BLOG do about this?  Very simply, do not buy copy protected CD's such as the current Velvet Revolver CD.  Buying these CD's is an endorsement of the death of fair use of the music we buy.  If there is appropriate consumer backlash, the record companies will cease its use.  If the current trend of rampant consumer acceptance of such technologies continues, copy protection will become the norm and consumers will have to buy one 20 dollar CD for the car, one 20 dollar super audio CD for the home, another 9 dollars for buying the 2-3 three actual decent tracks from a digital music vendor so we can play the music on our PC's and mp3 players.  People, this is the ideal market model for the record companies, if we do not speak up with our wallets now, they will be significantly lighter in the future.
