Went to Physical Environment class 1220 pm on Friday because the professor said that he's going to teach something that's going to be on the test, but it's not in the book! It was about adiabatic warming/cooling.. really easy bullshit. Then was sociology of gender.. he posted the grades, but me and a few other students grades weren't on there so i emailed the professor and i haven't got a response yet..  i'm about to open up a can of whoop ass because i want my fucking grade .. then at 330pm i had a calc 2 exam on chapter 8.. techniques of integration.. i'm placing bets that i got an A on it.. i actually think i got over 100% because of the bonuses. I didn't finish the exam until 520pm.. but after i was free to do whatever the hell i wanted...!  Ate dinner with the guys at about 6pm and we all decided we were going to chalk our IDs and go to Paulies.. At about 7pm we get a call from Josh saying that he wasn't allowed in.. Josh's chalked ID is a quality job.. apparently Paulies and the Post were going to be raided that night so they were being stingy with letting ppl in.. Plan B.. BEER AND LIQUOR RUN.. Jeff makes a few phone calls and finds a hook up.. We make some more phone calls and develop a list.. a huge list of liquor and beer totaling at a little over  $200 worth.. this would be the most expensive run in the history of runs up here .... this kid mike went to the liquor store right before it closed at 9pm and then picked us up to get the beer so me jeff and erek got into the car and head over to Hannaford.. i told the guys that we can't go in with mike because they are all going to ask us for ID.. but they didn't listen.. we all head over to the beer section and start packing a shopping cart full of beer. i run off and pick up some toiletries and when mike goes to check out the clerk said he saw mike walk in with other kids who need to show ID.. so we left Hannaford and went right across the street to Price Chopper and did it right this time.. we drive back to campus and meet 5 other people in the really shady part of the parking lot.. i stuff my 30 pack of Busch into my blue duffel bag, we all take what is ours and make a run back to all our dorms.  $200+ BEER/LIQUOR RUN COMPLETE.  to celebrate me, jeff, tom, erek, and kev crack open our bottles of beer or liquor and start drinking immediately!! a couple beers later i head up to 21.. where the entire floor is partying..  i literally had 4 suites to choose from to party in .. i played flip cup with people i've never met before.. we all introduced ourselves but i can't remember their names if you paid me.. we had some karaoke action in one of the rooms and i was singing something i can't remember the songs i was singing but i was sipping on two beers at a time, one in each hand.. then i go back into erek's room and supposely RA's (Residential Advisors) are on the floor busting people for open containers and being loud.. a few people got written up but not us.. what the fuck why were the RAs being such dicks that night i don't know.. i didn't get written up for shit so i'm fine. everyone quiet down for a little bit.. and everything after that was swell.. i got really drunk.. i also took a couple hits of the bong.. i was fucking spinning in my bed that night.. i slept well too  Woke up Saturday afternoon at about 4 pm. i felt well rested.. so i felt really good.. took a shower and got dressed and went to the campus center for chartwells over albany.. while me kev and erek were eating we notice these two girls on the line who were definitely on something... this chick was touchy touchy and laughing with a lot of people and then she got all scared and her pupils were dilated and she wouldn't stop laughing..  she was on SHROOMS .. it was very amusing.. as previously blogged when we all got back to the dorm  we all suffered from food poisoning      : (    i felt like shit.. and nothing would make me feel better other than BEER...!!! Started drinking at about 7pm.. sometime in between kevin from the 20th floor blazed me up and then i drunk more and we all played beer pong and battle pong.. it was a pretty dry night because a lot of people went out and a lot of people were shaken up for being written up the night b4.. oh yeah.. club 21 got written up SATURDAY MORNING.. RA's walked in and saw open containers everywhere... Josh's friend Dan from Cornell told us that he got 20 hours of community service for smoking trees.. up here in Albany we get 3 warnings before they do anything.. anyway it was a fun night...  Woke up this morning at about 3 pm.. showered got dressed and kev, erek, jeff, and I drove to the mall. We went into American Eagle and i couldn't help myself.. i was only supposed to get sandals but i ended up getting a couple shirts too.. I also put in an order for my SMUT hat.. i gotta pick it up tomorrow. it was so much fun.. i'm so used to being in college with kids about my age all their for school and drinking and whatnot.. i haven't been out in public like that.. like the mall in a while so we were all loud and rowdy.. i was also "cracked" out from the previous night so being in public kinda freaked me out. i miss having a car and driving around.. but i love the college lifestyle.. we only have 5 weeks of school left! i really am going to miss Albany and everything this place is about! i feel privileged to be going through this experience there are so many people out there whos lives really suck ass... my life is nothing but studying for easy bullshit classes and then partying like a fucking animal.. it's crazy  i am not taking this experience for granted i love every second of it .. truely the best 4 years of my life.  I am done for now... have a smutty day as always...!  - R w L super SMUT
