A gay and happy man will say, "Its a heaven my friend"; But his sad, depressed friend will say, "No dear, it is hell"  None really knows this world, Its is just a place  Where we have come to spend A few days , as a guest. Lets us just live In peace and love Lets just move on..... Towards fate and luck Lets just move on.....
