It was really funny also. Like when she stabs her ****** and shoves her mom into the bloody you know what. Also, when the girl throws up all over the priest and the best part was when she made her head spin all the way around. Genna and Amanda were freaking out, Matt and I were laughing. The only freaky part is when she rises from the bed with her blue eyes when the priests keep yelling "THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELLS YOU!"... you should of seen the young priest. They must of said that over 20 times, I saw the young priests face. He was completly sick of chanting out meaningless crap. Oh well, it was fun. After Genna's, Matt and I went to my cousin's for his birthday party. We played a few games and stuff. Well, the next thing I knew I watching Howard Stern and waking up to the sound of Tom (Matt's Brother) yelling out "DAM DAM DAM" to the Super Smash Brothers game. Thomas was Kirby and he defeated me, how miserable. Ya you like it Justin, Kirby's puffed up cheeks. Yes, good old times. Later on we went on the computer and saw this scary thing where you watch all these optical illusions and in the last one, it kind of looks like the shape of a head and out of no where comes a demon YELLING! Haha it was funny yet spooky. When I came home... I relized, the vacation is over. No more home. Homework and school. Misery. Ah wtf we have 1 more day! Let's all make the best of it!
