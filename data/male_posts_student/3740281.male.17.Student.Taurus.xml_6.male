Friday and Saturday I'm going to watch my little cousin play in his All-Star games, saturday night we're celebrating my Aunt's birthday, we're goin Cosmic bowling so that'll be kool i hope. i better get a tan sometime while im there...it's starting to fade...all the damn cloudy damn weather in SD sucks right now.
