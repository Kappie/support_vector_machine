It was a good day though with sunshine most of the day,except for the last fifteen minutes where it tipped it down and we had to retreat to the food tent. We saw a particularly funny sign while at the show and so took a photo on someones camera phone, but i have yet to get it sent to me, so when i do have it it willbe posted here. It was a large sign on one side of a cow pen with a rather large black cow within. The funny thing was on the sign it said "Tuck into roast beef!" which was particularly funny when the cow popped its head over the fence. Unfortunately the cow might not be seen very well on the photo because of its blackness but you will get the gist. Within this hour that i have  got after the show i've got to prepare myself to go to a concert. Yes Nicholas McMullin at a concert. Its by a guy calledbrian ferry and he seems to be quite famous to the friend i am going with's parents. Should be good, and it is a treat seeing as though im not doing much on my birthday. Oh well i better get back to that preperation i was talking about (and practise that nike ole game so that ii can beat toddy. grrr) Toodles         Edit: Unfortunately the show has been cancelled, laringitus or something, but im still going to my friend toms house. It'll be good whatever we end up doing.
