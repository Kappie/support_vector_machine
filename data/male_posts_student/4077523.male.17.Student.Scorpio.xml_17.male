Here I am trying to go out with a girl and if that doesn't work try to find another one who I think has great qualities (alot of them I know are more Christ-like than other girls I have ever known, while in the process they are the most beautiful than others which is hard to find). I have found alot of girls I know have great qualities and had a "crush" on some of them. But, God has spoken to me telling me that It isn't about the Girls, just get your relationship back on track with (God).      Recently I had a big let down with someone I know and it got me down for a while. However, I now realize that all this trying to go out with and thinking about girls has brought me down in my walk. I need to get back up and remember that God is all that matters, He will provide the desires of my heart when it is time.      I know that you probably have heard this alot, but if you really think about it and try to comprehend or understand what it is God is telling me to say you won't be let down. And if you are trying to get a girl friend because of how You feel or what You want or something about You which is the reason that I wanted one, then you don't really love the person you have a "crush" on or think you like. In 1 Corinthians 13:5 it says that Love is not Self-seeking. And think about it, if you are doing it for you to feel better by trying to make someone else feel better or just so you could feel better about you then you don't really need to think about dating until you get your life straight with God.      And don't worry about the question "Is this who God wants for me?" In my opinion He will let you know, so chances are if you have to ask that question it probably isn't the person. Well anyway if anyone finds anything wrong with this post let me know, but I just felt the Holy Spirit leading me to say it. Well C-ya. -Fly With Christ
