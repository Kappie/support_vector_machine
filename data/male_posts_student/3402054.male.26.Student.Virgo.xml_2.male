My logic is that the old saw "you are what you eat" applies to how you consume items of thought as well.  If a child reads more challenging material, then he will outperform the child who consumes information from television and junk magazines (I recall the old Wall Street Journal advertisement.)  "You are what you eat."  I started the South Beach Diet three days ago, so if I am what I eat, then I am doing better than I ever have.  But if I am what I read, then... BarBri?  So the first posting of substance on Hollando's Blogspot is a dull protein performance drink.  Though I have had no time to read for pleasure, I have been reading.  I have been pouring over two of  nine  books that have been sold to me as part of my review for the Texas Bar Exam.  BarBri, the most commonly chosen review course at Baylor, is a master of overkill.  These nine books together weigh thirty seven pounds.  Everyone tells me with great confidence that I need not read all the materials provided.  With the Bar just a month and a half away, I lack that confidence.  But my de facto reading amounts to some smattering of pages from the day's assignment and my reading of lecture materials while I fill in blanks.  Taking law school courses during BarBri was not a wise decision.  Nor have I been successful in juggling four capstone projects and an externship at the local District Attorney's office (arguably a fifth capstone).  I graduate on July 31.  How will I complete all of this work?  My plan of attack is to read the full assignments going forward and to review the lectures we covered.  Then, if time allows [insert laugh track], I will read those seventy-page daily outlines from the last two weeks.  As MBE practice test approaches on July 26, I will try my hand at a few practice tests.  What do my readers think?  Post a few comments and advise me.  I am the first lawyer in my family, and I am flying blindly.
