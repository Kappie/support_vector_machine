Some say I write good poems, I'll take their word for it, but this won't be thought out, I'll just put down whatever comes to mind.   -UNSCATHED   Feelings, thoughts,such confusing topics,  especial for the simple adolescent mind.  Like fireworks a euphoric explosion sends you upward,  But the hope is suddenly destroyed with a fiery explosion.   One knows that everything comes to an end,  But why? It never started.  The chance was evidently never there,  However, hope and emotion blocked the evidence,  As in shrouding it in a cloak of darkness.   Hate doesn't exist,  Only confusion, frustration, unable to understand.  How is the game played? How does it work?  Questions no one can possible answer,  Only answers can be experienced.   Many styles, strategies,  Not a single alike, everyone's different.  As a flock of birds, many look identical,  Yet all different in evident ways.  Each does what it needs to survive.   friendships begin, but don't end,  Nothing like it on this earth.  Life is only similar,  Life begins, and ends on earth,  But the end is only the beginning in an unknown paradise.   Each bump is only temporary in the road of life.  A wreck can be fixed,  But only to an extent.  Petty things don't matter,  I'll go through the flames unscathed.   -zack g.
