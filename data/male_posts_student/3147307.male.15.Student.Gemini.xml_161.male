Friday evening is out for me (movie night) - anything else works for us Harts. Since nothing exciting happened big today this'll be my post of the day.   urlLink So Cold - Breaking Benjamin  - watch the music video  in its entirety  and tell me what you think! its interesting. Come on - especially if you have DSL or cable it'll only take like 5 minutes of your time and its a very interesting video.  Marge: Homer, the plant called. They said if you don't show up tomorrow, don't bother showing up on Monday. Homer: Woohoo, four-day weekend.  And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. Genesis 2:21 (I won't have a verse tomorrow for the Other Twenty-Three  I'm on a creepy theme today.  urlLink here's a story by famous short story writer Shirley Jackson  - I ask you to take your time to read this as well. it's a weird story. comment about it as well. Most high schoolers read this for school before they graduate.
