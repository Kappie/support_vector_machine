Although Forest Gump has a different, hilarious speech pattern, there is also a great deal of 50's and onward pop culture and history incorporated, and although the apex of the class is already behind us, viewing FG historically is an alternative and equally entertaining method of watching enjoying it.  Secondly, I want everyone's opinion on prom... the good, the bad, the ugly- and I don't mean Kolkmeyer's dress (JK Kolk, you looked hot and I love ya).  Would you want it at Union Station again?  Any feedback you can provide will help make next year's prom as ridiculously perfect as possible.  Congrats to Clark on her new job, but we'll miss ya next year.  Love Rob
