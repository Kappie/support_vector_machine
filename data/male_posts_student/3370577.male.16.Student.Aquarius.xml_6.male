Enterview Rating:  6.0  Description:   In the near future, as a result of our pollution of this world's environment, the polar ice caps will melt. As the ice caps melt, they will send billions of gallons of fresh water into our oceans. Because of this, there won't be enough salt in the water. And because there is no salt in the water, tornadoes, hurricanes, tidal waves, sub-zero temperatures and mad wolves will occur... WHAT?! Exactly. I'm not the most scientifically inclined person in the world, but I'm pretty sure the world wouldn't end if there wasn't enough salt in the ocean.   But that's exactly the plot of Day After Tommorow, the end-of-the-world disaster flick from the director of Independence Day (which wasn't a very good movie either). This movie is so chock full of cliches and stereotypes, I had trouble trying to find any hint of originality. There's the troubled scientist (played by Dennis Quaid) who also happens to be the only one who knows about the end of the world. Also, he's the troubled father who's gone on business all the time and the relationship with his son is suffering because of it. Two stereotypes in one character? I know, I had trouble believing it too.  Day After Tommorow is by no means a bad movie. The special effects in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen. Seriously, they're amazing. The shots of frozen Manhattan were so hauntingly realistic, I got the chills while watching it. But I think that the special effects were the only thing that kept this struggling ship afloat.
