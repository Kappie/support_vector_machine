Managed to snatch alot of balls. >.  Here comes the best part. It was Chem make-up lessons cum mini optional test. We did tutorial in LT2 and after a period of fun, peace, laughter and joy, Mdm Koh wanted to start the optional test. I persuaded her like fook and after 10 mins of persuasion, she gave in! Winner! In the end, the mini test became a homework. Lol. Love the way this teacher treats me. 2gd4me.   After that, I went home and decided to go and buy a pair of shoes for myself. Lol. I walked from my house to Shaw to Mustafa to United Square.At least 5km of walking. -.-" Finally, I bought a pair of Adidas Superstar at US. Then I made my way to St. Michael's where I fetched my brother home.   Talking to the 2 fags now... Gotta return to the conversation before they start f-ing me up. Looking forward to tml, meeting them + chilling in Orchard + watching 'i,robot'. It's gonna be fun tml. ^^   Darius, I believe you can get over it soon, just like me. >.
