There's so much group as well as individual work packed into each day that it's easily 2 am before I go to sleep. The last week was particularly hectic, and this week seems almost equally so. So I get about 5 hours of sleep at night, which is a little less than I would have desired. But so far, I have always felt fresh in the morning and while attending classes. But after lunch, the effects of sleeping late are felt and I take a nap of half an hour in the afternoon. I don't like sleeping in the afternoon, but I don't have much choice.
