The weather sucked, the scene I like doesn't really exist there, the weather sucked, and one of my best friend(the one I was staying with) realized that we had grown too much apart, and no wild sex( :  So i'n the 2 days that i have been back, i allready spent about 2 times as much on fucking batman comics. But since comic are one off my hobbys, i'm pretty thrilled about it. i bought some real Batman must haves. i also had to work today. can you believe this. i come home from work and the make me work all fucking day. so that really sucked. but on the plus side. i did get to see allot of hot chicks at work. and i started to make up songs and lyrics. but i didn't get a chance to write them down, wich is shitty because i really liked them, but now i lost them again.  Well i'm gonno go read again. and tonight im gonna dream about all the hot chicks i have seen in the last 2 weeks. but alas i can only dream, this is the fate of the weird guy who gets real shy whenever he sees a hot chick. :
