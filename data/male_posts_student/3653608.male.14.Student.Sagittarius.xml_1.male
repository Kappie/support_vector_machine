I only had a couple of Archers Aqua, a couple of beers so I was ok. I love Archers Aqua. Its sooo nice! I must have been a little pissed though, because In a game of spin the bottle I got off with 3 people, two of which were girls.  1. Kathryn, as in mrs Squeers (who is a great kisser) 2. Jenny (who is a baaad kisser) 3. Hector (I didn't get off with him properly though)  I feel grief for him, I cannot seem to help it, I wish to do more violence  I love angel, and Illyria. It doesn't help that it was the last ever Angel on saturday. Lame. Poor Wesley.  Gotta go to lameass registration know *bangs fists* See ya xxx
