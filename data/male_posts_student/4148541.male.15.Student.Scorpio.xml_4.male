First my mom dropped us off @ the Luas Line the Train that runs around dublin  which took us right to St.Stephen's green which is right next to the BIG shopping plaza. I went and looked @ digi cameras. My dad might buy 1. So yay!:)  Some ladies were checking me out....or laughing at me I couldnt tell. But they looked @ me twice. At least I am "of interest". I found a place I might be able to work its a gaming cafe where you can pay to play games on computers for Euro's.  I have to work under the table though. Anyway it was fun. I saw an adult toy shop (didnt seem like one at first) it had samurai swords and misc cool stuff and there were other kids inside so it obviously didn't look like what it was.   My bro saw the yugioh movie and was wowed by it...how suprising. My brother is such a dweeb. ERGH!  Peace
