I told him that this was what it's like to be friends with him. He said forget about the friends stuff. We hung out the whole day and I helped him in his quest to find a job. It was pretty fun. I left school early that day to see him and its nothing different. I always leave now to see him. Well at 5 P.M, we went out seperate ways and I ended up in Brooklyn cause i took the wrong train! i got home at 6:45. My new friend, who is my ex, who is still to me my significant other, called me. I was happy, but i didnt wanna make it look like i was waiting because i wasnt waiting for his call. I told him that i didnt even get a hug from him and he says that i didnt deserve it. he's  planning to go to Rhode Island for college. He didnt wanna say anything cause i might get upset. I said it was ok, will work something out. Then i brought up the part when he said forget about the friends stuff. He said it because he didnt want to talk about it. I took it the wrong way. i thought it was because we were back on. My heart dropped, but i shouldnt be suprised, hes not like anyone else, and i like that about him. He is taking his time. He tells me my whole life is infront of me. Thats true, but i want and wish he was there with me as everything flashes and doors open. i cant believe i mistook what he said. i felt so stupid. one thing that really puzzles me is that, why wont he let me hold on to him?    "I'm finding my way back to you and everything i used to be and waiting is all that i can do until you find your way back to me"
