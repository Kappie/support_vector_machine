It rained the whole time we were there so we didn't get to go to the beach. That's about it. We stayed around the house. I'm really tired now. I had gymnastics tonight at 7 and my hands are killing me. I ripped the side of my thumb on the high bar. I came home from the ride today and went straight to my computer here. I think I was on around 3 hours and before I knew it we ordered Chinese food (I had that chicken stuff) then I headed off to gymnastics. So what I'm trying to say is the day went fast. Good thing too. I can't wait to sleep in my own bed. The house will be quiet. Rachel is in Maryland and Reid is down the street at a friends. I love the quietness!
