What really hurts me here is the quote by Edward Norton.    But the hits continue. In April, Edward Norton said of Bush: “As an actor, I know in my mind, watching him, what a low-quality mind he has.”   Fight Club is one of my favorite movies, and now when I watch it I can't escape the fact that both Norton and Brad Pitt think I am just another moron, incapable of deep thought.  Boo hoo.....
