I am secluded in my social activities, undisciplined, and failing to bring up discussions that truly matter and in their stead bring up meaningless drivel and refuse to fill my faults. I have never started a conversation with the most forward of intents of giving my testimony, my reasons for Christianity. I've debated, ironically enough, the means and doctines of my faith, but never taught, never truly listened. When I spoke to one debater at camp, I was left with a cold feeling, a cruel loss somehow. I felt empty, spent, in need of a frappe or some form of rejuvenation. All of my discussions of God have started and ended wtih that feeling. All of this was true before today. I had a conversation with Emily that I can only hope to repeat with others again and again until I die, and that with a smile of accomplishment. We spoke of God, of Jesus, of man and the forgiveness of sin. We learned of each other's faith. And I told her my dearest secret, which I dare put in writing now:  The night after my Profession of Faith (a Christian Reformed spiritual event that means I am inducted into the Church as a full member), I was filled with joy. I walked the path and was pleased with the path I walked. I was a Christian of my own accord now. My parents lead and taught me, but this was my move, my choice, without any discussion with anyone. I prayed to God and reconfirmed my vows to him: to worship him alone, to love and plead for only his love, and to serve him and others through him and him through others. Then something happened. I know God has tended to use less direct confrontation in these waning years. He rarely sends angels and visions, and those that receive rarely see. But something happened that night; God spoke or at least sent a thought into my mind. Some may say that that thought was my own and I imagine it was from God, but I can state unwaveringly it was sent from above in the truest sense. It said. "Don't worry, Dan. I am with you." That's all. No, "Don't worry, Dan. I am the God you have followed all these years. No "Become a missionary, Dan, and teach my ways to the world." These were spoken to God in my promises, the ones I mentioned above. I say that this thought felt familiar to me, like I knew this God, as He knew me very well indeed. That is why I am a Christian. This God did not say he was Allah or Brahma or any other relgion's God. I am certain he is the God I have worshiped all these years.  A great question occured in my mind as Emily told me of her faith and incounters with God. How can God, if he is the God of the Christians, also reasure Emily in her choice of religion? Emily freely admits that she believes Jesus to simply be a man and nothing more. Calvin, I'm afraid, in all his brassness and straightforward speak, would say that Emily did not truly hear God or somesuch. I don't think that is true. I could hear truth in her words, and that was a bittersweet true. I don't know what to make of it. I must prayerfully consider this all, treasure it in my heart. Hope may come later.  This was the up. The down occurred in the debate we fought after this talk. It went painfully. Firstly, we dueled against a total novice, and a second-year. We bungled several arguments, ran things that we should not have run, didn't run things that we should...and so on. I fear to speak to Emly about all this, even in lou of our discussion. I hate critizing people, especially friends and even moreso partners. Even postive critism is a massive pain to produce. *sigh* If you read this, Emily, and feel you can accept a humble man's foolish thoughts, ask me of it.
