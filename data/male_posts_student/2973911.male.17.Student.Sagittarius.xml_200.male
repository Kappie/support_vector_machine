I just feel like getting my little lengua the heck.  It's something ridiculous and maybe painful.  But I really like getting my mouth bleeding bad.  Anyway, I was only being sadomasochistic.  I'm really happy today; sorta'.  I am getting good *bleep* performance at school.  Um, okay, not that good.  I'm going to have my first midterm tomorrow (Saturday) on PE 4.  It's Badminton.  I also have a delayed project for that subject.  I don't know if it will still be accepted.  Then, there are two other computer-related projects.  One about Computer Generations and the other about Modern hardware and software.  Plus bio of Bill *bleep*ing Gates.  Who wants to know that guy's history?  Anyway, I need em both on Monday.  And I haven't found anything useful.  Dear beautiful and lovely Rox, I really, really implore you to change the earlier lines on my work from "fourth grade" to second grade.  And I think I learned to say *bleep* than say (*bleep*) so may I suggest you change my cuss words to that *bleep* thing.  It's far more...moral.  And also, you can bother to place my name to the Anonymous thingamajig.  I don't care.  It's either I'm ready to face criticism, and I would rather tell the truth.  This is me.  Know me.  Please judge me for drying out loud.  Tell the world who I am!!!  Or maybe I'm totally losing it and I'm ready to face the gun barrels of the fathers of the girls I mentioned.  Bring it on.  I didn't say anything immoral.  I have nothing to be embarrassed about.    And, boys, when I say "fantasy" I'm not talking about the ones where you get your jollies, okay?  It's literal.  Like unicorns and faeries fantasies?  I'm the kinda guy who thinks like a child but processes like a senile and ridiculously old sage.    Ha, there.  I've said every living trash in my nervous system.  I guess I can probably reboot now.  -------------------
