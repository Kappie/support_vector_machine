I started Shemnue today, it's such a magical game, had alot of fun playing it, I think it's for the best, I'll be able to play Shemnue 2 after.. with the same save!! *gasps*  I'm gunna get a nice long lie in tomorrow morning, then play lots of shemnue =D  Just watched "I'm A Celebrity.." quality watching time, I recorn Lord B or Kerry should win, that'd be cool.  No one's online, well, I say no one.. no one I talk to, my toes itch
