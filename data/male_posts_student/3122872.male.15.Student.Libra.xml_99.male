I have  not  managed to get a life yet, although the nice lady at the mental hospital said I could have a bed in about 6 months) I suppose I  could  fill you in... but that would be too much bother... awww who am I kidding, its not like I have anything else to do... *sigh* Here goes...  First of all, I've got a girlfriend... and before the multitudes out there think its the end of the world... I don't know how either... so don't ask me... (that includes you phil :P )  Second of all... I'm in Canada, or Canadia depending on your sexual orientation... staying with my aunt... and a 2 year old cousin who  will not stop following me  > :| )  Bah...   (no phil... you cannot ask questions...) I wish I had proper titles to my posts like emma... but I just can't be bothered...  Meh...
