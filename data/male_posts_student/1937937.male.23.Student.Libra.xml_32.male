What Sarin? ... just trying to provide a little spectrum after that damning Sy Hersh article -- which, you'll notice, Safire completely ignores: "We flagellate ourselves for mistreatment by a few of our guards, who will be punished." After reading the article, tell me -- do you think that you're a defeatist?  I think I'm a defeatist: what the fuck are we doing in Iraq?  Can somebody just answer that, instead of telling me the reasons why we shouldn't say no to going to Iraq?  If we're there for human rights, then we should maybe look at our relationship with China.  Too idealistic a thought process?  Could be.  If we're there for oil, then why does it cost $2.07 to buy 87 grade gas?  And if we're there for terrorists, well:  what  terrorists?  Osama?  Osama who?  Are we always kept in the dark like this?  I'm just a kid: 23 years old, I don't remember 'nam or Oliver North, but man, what a strange country (world?) this is.
