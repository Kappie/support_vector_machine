Work and school have been beating me down like Moe's head under the letter press while Curly is twisting the top and making poor Moe's head want to explode. Sorry, Three Stooges reference. Deal with it.  But yeah, I'm likely to be busy for the next couple of weeks too, with finals week rapidly approaching. Ah well, c'est la vie.  Later.
