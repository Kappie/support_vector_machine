I'll post it later because I'm at school right now.   Christmas presents abound, though no Jenny yet. This is most serious. :P  This is probably the most casual Christmas for me ever. I haven't even really thought about what I really want, a total contrast with my typical material desire of practically everything. Maybe I could be Buddhist.  I'm cutting 4th for Claudia. I'm horrible. And yet super-sweet at the same time. I contradict my own mind. Help.  I can now watch End of Evangelion without subtitles. I know the whole movie. Except that stupid 2 minute scene in the Mayor's office with the freaky pendulum where they talk about boring crap. Meh.  I want a Kaworu plushy. Love me.   I'm not sure I ever made a post when Tristan and Claudia broke up, but I think this is what's being addressed in the beginning. I still don't know that one part of End of Evangelion.
