Doesn't it make you want to eat lye?  I read the beginning of O'Reilly's book tonight while I was smoking.  He says that if you drink a lot or smoke crack (because they are the same things) that you shouldn't have his book.  He actually says, although jokingly, that if you are in any of the preceeding categories you probably stole the book and should give it back.  I have done lots of acid, and I am reading his book.  And I watch his show every night, although I make sure not to buy any of the products advertised during the broadcast so that the purpose of the show doesn't snatch me.  I don't know whether or not he actually believes what he says.  I don't know what is worse.  It's the same way I feel when I listen to preachers on TV at 2 am.  I am not sure what is more reprehensible, believing in greedy nonsense or pretending to so you can make a buck or get some fame.  Oh well.
