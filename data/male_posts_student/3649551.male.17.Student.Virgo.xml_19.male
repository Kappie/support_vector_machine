Imagine a small sea of hippies: bearded, tie-dyed, pierced, stoned, drunk, stinky, stoned, drunk, and ugly as sin. Now imagine these people doing Snoopy-dances song after song. When I say Snoopy-dances, I'm talking about the dancing in ... oh what's the title ...  Merry Christmas Charlie Brown ? I think that's it. Anyway, the characters do  one  dance move which is then looped for a long period of time. Did I mention that one move is absolutely ridiculous? That's what the hippies were doing. For a  long  time. It never really got old. These people were just spinning around, swinging their arms, jumping up and down, happy as could be. And drunk, in most cases. As a matter of fact, there werea fewrequirements for joining in: one, you had to be drunk, stoned, or mentally retarded. The place reeked of body odor and alcohol. Two, you had to be way too old to be dancing. Well, you didn't  have  to be, but it seemed to be the norm. Three, it helps if you're gay. Two very overweight lesbians were dancing in a very disturbing manner. Very lesbian. Very ugly. I shudder to think ... Ok, I call them hippies, but mainly they were just freaks. But they were having fun. And I do respect the fact that they were comfortable enough to dance like that. Whether or not they had reason to be comfortable with themselves, I won't say. But they were a happy bunch. Oh man, were they happy. I wish I could get that much enjoyment out of reggae. I like it and all, but ... I guess I'm just not a dancer. I can recognize that and refrain, while others ... never mind. I think alcohol really adds to the experience, though. And marijuana, but I didn't smell too much. Mainly it was the booze. Here'sthe halfshell in a nutshell: people you don't know and would rather not see, andpeople you do know and would rather not see. Other than the people I was with, I only saw a few people that I was happy to see. Like two. I saw a  lot  of people that I don't like, though.  I do love living in a small town. You just can't escape charming personalities. Charming, in this sense, can be interpreted in any way you please.
