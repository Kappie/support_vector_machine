For all the crap people give him, his music is calming and pretty much sums up all teenage emotion into song form. Man am I gonna get crap for that.  But on to other things.  I really want to go for one all nighter with friends before the summer is out. Driving around the city in the cool summer air. Visiting different locations and walking under the stars, joking: "Your momma..." We will run foot races in the sacred ninja training grounds (at an undisclosed location) and walk the streets of uptown. We will scream random lines out of movies at the sky and wait to hear it answer back. We will sit at coffee shops until we get kicked out. When we do we will find another one. We will go bowling. We will go to waffle house at 3:24 am to see if it really is open 24 hours a day.  dance with kings and roll with pigs  I was wondering, "what makes someone a hopeless romantic?"

A growing presence. As it grew he realized it was not the presence itself that was growing, for it had always been there, but rather it was his perception of the presence that grew. He felt a warmth from another source other than the sun. He felt it all around him.  kafoobles.  He vanished into the mist almost as if he was the mist.
