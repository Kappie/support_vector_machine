Yes my friend brittany is by far the best bumpyat ever! ;)  Ok, so today was very very good. I called work and faked sick so i didnt have to work today. Then later on ryan picked me up and he paid me the $20 he owed me, so we went to exclusive and for the first time ever i found Alkaline Trios selftitled cd and maybe ill catch fire. They were just sitting there in the front of all the other cds. So instinctively i bought them. the total came to $20.98. thats not bad for 2 very kick ass cds. Man, those guys are so good. If you havent heard them then go listen to them and you will discover why they are my favorite band!  haha brittany and vanessa came over and as usual it was a fun time. brittany left early because she was down and we wanted her to cheer up so she went home. so it was just me and vanessa. Hahaha we beat the crap out of each other for about an hour straight, i mean there were wedgies, slapping, kicking, punching, pinching, and licking. yes folks licking. hahah we were licking each others faces and it was very salivaish. After a little while i pinned vanessa and i found out where she was ticklish! haha i used that to my advantage, haha she couldnt get away, i was on top of her just tickling away. she was squirmming so much, i dont think ive every seen anyone squirm like that haha. it was very hilarious.  i realized i drink alot of mountain dew. and i got to thinking, what if one day im enjoying a dew outside and i accidentally wonder onto a set of train tracks and i get hit by a train. Man that would suck. I bet i would crap my pants mega tons because when you die you poop your pants and i mean come on, getting hit by a train would make anyone shit bricks.
