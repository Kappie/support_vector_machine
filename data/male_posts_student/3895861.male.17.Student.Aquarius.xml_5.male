Does anybody really think that these men are in it for the ppl of this land? Do you really thik you are rich enough to vote? Do you think it mattered that the last election was decided in a courtroom? What a sham. These men are in somebody's pocket. Anyone worth a damn is in somebody's pocket. They are not out for the personal interest of you or me or Bob or Jill or anybody that doesn't own a multi-national corporation. They only want a few things. They want us to maintain internal peace and order. The ways to do that? Go to war every few years, or at least have military activity every so often. 1910s-WWI 1920s good economy, at least if u were well off. 1930s-depression 1940s-WWII 1950s-good economy for the rich, and those who fought were ok, too 1960s-Space race, cuz we cant nuke the ruskies if they can nuke us back 1970s Vietnam- this was fun b/c ppl were shot on TV and so Merika says "What? were killing ppl? good innocent ppl like u and me? We are fighting for something they dunt believe in, but we want democracy for all ppl? What?, All they want is money? 1980s-Iran until good economy,then on the heels of recession 1990s persian gulf then good economy 2000s 9/11 terror, Aghanistan, Iraq (WHY?!?!) and by golly gee the econmy is doing good again. What's next? Korea? Mars? (did somebody drop a hint that there was oil there? [NASA aint dumb]). Honest, inelligent ppl that i know are not only voting, but for these ppl. Who gives a shit who sits in that chair? Somebody owns them. And not at half-life, either. To all of you patriotic imbeciles i say: OPEN YOUR EYES! LOOK AROUND YOU! READ A BOOK ON POLITICS! Read one. One book that is of a semi-political nature will tell at the very least that the system is corrupt to the very core. Anything left wing will, anyway. 6 corporations own the communications of the planet. They will do what it takes to maintain this order. If you own the communication, you the ideas. But mike, if they own communication, then how come there are so many books and articles and tv shows out there about how the system is corrupt out there? I will tell you. You will read those books, you will watch that TV, u will read articles in the news, and u will not be fighting. You will be calm. You will be shamefully appeased. You will believe the government was made by the common man, you will believe that the common man benefits from it, and you will continue to live in the system. American history is wrought with class struggle(before mass media). You didn't know that? You didn't know that there was a socialist party in the united states until all of their leaders were sent to jail for speaking against the war (WWI)? You didn't know that speaking against the government is illegal? They sent ppl to prison for sedition for that. You still got an A in history? I bet you did. They taught you other things. They didn't lie, they just didn't tell the whole truth. Did they tell you that there used to be a huge, inter-industry union? Did they tell you that they were sent to jail for the same reasons the socialists were? That sux. Maybe you wouldn't have bought in. Or maybe...  you would have anyway. What can you do? What can a person do without organizing? What can a person do without making himself known? Maybe you would be important, right?, a real history maker. Or maybe, you wouldn't make it into the books at all, other than one more person for president? Maybe you would become an unperson. The people who were supposed to know who you were might be made to forget, or remember it without significance. Then your family would die, only recorded with birth and death and marriage and military service certificates. That is all that matters to them, you know. You get born, you get married and make more proletarian, you get shot at for a cause you wouldn't believe in if you knew anything about, or, even if you did, you would shoot to keep from dying. Then, the last part, you die. Did you die of ignorant bliss? Did you die reasonably appeased? Did you die bent and broken by a system designed to do just that to you?   What does it all mean? Does it mean I will make a run at the system? No. Does it mean you should? No. Is there anything to be done? No. Am I happier to know what I know? Fuck no. I wish i was dumb as a rock. I wish I loved america like a 3 year old loves it's mother. Mama=good Anyone against Mama=bad. But I can't. I can't feel that way. What am I going to do? I am going to carve out my menial existence. I am going to have at least one wife and at least 3 kids. I am going to find a nice house and drive a nice car and I am going to go to work and support my growing family. Then, when I retire, I am going to keep living until I die. Sound like fun? It's all you get.  I think that's all I got. I am still angry, and I will be for a long time, but I am still going to do what they dont wasnt me to do. I am going to drink to get drunk, I am going to smoke to get high, I am going to be critical of the gov't which will not be overthrown, but best of all, my favorite part, I am going to let ppl know something. Laws are paper. They are only as valuable as that which they are written on PLUS the value you give them. Live life how you want to live it, and don't take any shit, and life will get better for ppl. Show your indoctrinated brothers in the police and in the military that they aren't fighting for what the ppl want, even if they get violent. Hack the ruling classes support among the poor (us) slowly to pieces. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. We may trip, we may fall, one person can be silenced, but a movement, an undercurrent, a suffocating swath of people fighting cannot be supressed.   or maybe it wont happen at all, but it is worth a shot
