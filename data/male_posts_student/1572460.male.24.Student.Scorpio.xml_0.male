It's no longer a question of staying healthy. It's a question of finding a sickness you like."    - Jackie Mason, US Comedian    December 29, 2002 - 5:45 am IST   I woke up, almost startled, and it took me a few seconds to realize that Gulf Air flight GF-52 was preparing for landing at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. I was experiencing a throbbing headache for almost half of the 30-hour long journey from Denver, Colorado to Mumbai and was tired like never before, with stop-overs at New Jersey, London-Heathrow, Abu Dhabi and Bahrain, the last one being just a technical stop. Now you know, 'long journey' will perhaps be an understatement. This was the most grueling journey of my life and just never seemed to end. I hate air travel, yes I do. Not that I am someone who has done a lot of flying-around-the-world thing, but whatever little I have traveled by air, I just did not take a liking to it. The continuous high-pitched whine of the aircraft engine (perhaps more appropriately associated with a jet propeller engine) makes me numb after a while, and my efforts of finding solace (maybe 'comfort' is a more decent word) with typical on-the-plane activities like listening to music and reading, usually prove unsuccessful. Not that there is really anything else to do except for smiling (I am not a 'talker') at fellow passengers and peering through the small windows for brief glimpses of the outer space which initially seems to draw your attention, but as you move on, drives you to boredom. Worse, the 7 of us from Colorado State, who were traveling on the same leg throughout, from Denver to Mumbai, were spread out on the plane, as we did not manage to get the seats booked together. So our plans of having whatever little fun we could with each other's company were already busted.  I still spent most of my time listening to Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler solos - my newly found craze for Classic/Progressive Rock, thanks to my dear cousin Shailesh, alias Bhushan -  urlLink http://bhush.tripod.com , and affectionately called 'Big B', who first introduced me to his music. Many thanks also go to Siddharth, a.k.a. Sid -  urlLink http://hawkeyejo.blogspot.com , good friend and roommate at CSU, for allowing me to access his MK collection! As they say, Sachin Tendulkar is God's gift to Cricket or God Himself, and I guess Knopfler, the 'Sultan of Swing', draws similar comparisons when it comes to Classic Rock. Interesting fact being that, Sachin himself is a tremendous fan of Knopfler! The man is God when it comes to guitar playing. The guy is phenomenal. I am not a connoisseur of Music or Guitars, but my hats off to him! Nikhil, a college friend of mine in India who plays the guitar, and is a 'jammer' himself, once said that if you learn the guitar chords (what they call as 'chord progression'), understanding and appreciating Knopfler's amazing work becomes even more obvious. As a matter of fact, Bhush and I share very common music interests and he was also the one who hooked me onto another GOD, of Indian music this time, none other than ARR (A.R. Rahman), some 10 years ago. I do not wish to digress too much, so I intend to write separately on ARR and Knopfler sometime later.  I had managed to get very little sleep in the past 30 hours of a physically and mentally taxing journey. Now, that perhaps could be an overstatement. Here I was, on the way to my home country, for the most awaited one-month's vacation of my lifetime, and there was really nothing I could crib about.  We got off the plane at Mumbai with an immense sense of relief, and fortunately, it took just 30 minutes for immigration, baggage claim and customs clearance; unusual scenes at a place, which is teeming with people all year round. My patience had already been tested to the limit in the last 30 hours and last minute hiccups with customs/baggage would have made matters worse. It was smooth sailing (or should I say 'flying'!) for us, when it came to these 'worst fears' associated with air travel. Pheeew!  Once outside the terminal, I instantly spotted my mom and my dad and waved. This wasn't exactly true with them. They spotted me mostly because of my 'CSU' t-shirt, and according to them (especially my mom), I was almost unrecognizable. Ofcourse, they attributed this to what they thought as unimaginable weight loss. And although this was true, I wasn't even aware of the fact that I looked shockingly different from my old self, when I had left for USA 18 months ago. Since my parents were the first and only people who were seeing me after such a long gap, they were obviously alarmed at my physical condition. To be frank, I guess I looked pathetic and completely worn out. I do recall friends at CSU saying that I looked much leaner of late, but their reaction was not really as serious as my parents'. Understandably so, since my parents met me after a span of 18 months, and they noticed the change more easily than my friends who were used to seeing me everyday. We pushed off for Pune; I was thrilled to be back in my homeland, but completely unaware of the fact that I would be in for a rude shock the coming New Year.   Here, I would like to add something, which my dad revealed to me later, after I was diagnosed. My dad has been a Type-II diabetic for the last decade or so (more on the technicalities of diabetes later), and he was well experienced to sense that something was wrong with me. An hour or two after we met at the terminal and were in the car on our way to Pune, he was the only one conscious of the fact that I drank two big bottles of water (almost 3 litres) in the space of an hour. Drinking water in such proportions is not only unusual for any person (perhaps true with very few people in extreme cases, as in sportspersons who constantly consume fluids to keep themselves hydrated), but my dad's fear that I might have 'diabetes' grew even more, when my weight loss was backed up by my 'unquenchable thirst' and the 'dry mouth' syndrome. He kept mum about his feelings during that time, and must have hoped that eventually he would be wrong.   December 30, 2002   The first couple of days (December 29-30) were pretty busy, meeting family and friends, answering phone calls, and catching up on some well deserved rest and sleep. By this time, my apparent weight loss and worn out looks had become the focal point of my conversation with anybody who met with me in person. In spite of the fact that this 'issue' grabbed so much attention, I (and others around me) was/were, still absolutely unprepared for what was in store a day later. I shrugged off this issue most of the times.  The truth of the matter was that I had lost a whopping 20 pounds within the last 6 months, more precisely, starting June 2002, from whatever analysis and comparison I could draw from my photographs before June and after June, and I had no fundamental explanation as to why this had happened. Another fact that was hard to be not noticed for all of us was the frequent runs to the bathroom that I made. Again, something which I now find surprising myself, I was the least bothered about this in the last 6 months, and like the other two symptoms (thirst and weight loss), I was completely ignorant of the fact that I urinated once every hour. I am not sure if this was the case every day, since June, but in the past three months during the Fall semester, I can recall myself waking up thrice in the night regularly to urinate. Drinking bottles and bottles of water (and then urinating) became a routine thing for me, and I even remember having a laugh or two on this, with my friends. Worse, I had even joked once, that I might have diabetes. Diabetes runs in our family, and I was aware of some of the symptoms associated with it. Ignorance is bliss was my motto for a while, and since I felt perfectly fit otherwise, I did not even care to discuss these things with my parents on the phone. I kept telling them that I never felt better ever in my whole life and was doing alright.  	 In reality, my pancreas was losing its fight inside my body over these months. (Note: I plan to discuss all the gory details of diabetes in the next few chapters, so forgive me if some things seem unclear at this point). The beta cells or islet cells (also called the 'Islets of Langerhans', named after Paul Langerhans who discovered them), which produce the hormone 'insulin' in the pancreas were battling to survive against my body's immune system.  urlLink Merriam-Webster  defines an immune system as: 'the bodily system that protects the body from foreign substances, cells, and tissues by producing the immune response '. In short, the immune system, which normally battles to keep us alive and healthy, was instead, gradually destroying and wiping out the islet cells that produce insulin, the hormone essential for converting sugar, carbohydrates, starches and other food into energy (metabolism) needed for daily life. The  urlLink American Diabetes Association (ADA)  describes insulin as the hormone that "unlocks" the cells of the body, allowing glucose to enter and fuel them. I was a victim of all the 'classic' symptoms of Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus.  In the meanwhile, my dad's fear grew more into concern and impatience and he suggested that I check my blood glucose levels using his glucometer, before I go see our family doctor. A glucometer is a device used to measure a person's blood glucose levels, and my dad used it to check his own sugars once in a while. Glucometers are still not very well prevalent in India; my cousin, Milind, had brought one for my dad from the US a few years ago. It's an extremely convenient device (these days more of a 'smart' blood glucose monitoring system) to check one's blood sugars at home, without having to visit laboratories to submit blood samples, and then (anxiously) wait for the results. Glucometers give results within seconds, and moreover, do not compromise for accuracy. More on glucometers later... The only thing that turns people off when they see a glucometer is the idea of pricking your fingers for a blood sample. Now, this is actually a much better option, than getting a blood sample using a painful needle and syringe, since these lancing devices use a thin needle to prick (or lance, as they call it), and most important, the person can use it on his/her own, independently, without somebody else drawing the blood for you. This particular glucometer was pretty obsolete by current standards, and did have a fairly thick needle as compared to the one that I use at present. But since I had seen my dad regularly using it, I had no intentions of making a fuss about pricking myself. The seriousness of my symptoms was starting to bother me too, and I thought about getting over with everything once and for all. This was really no big deal, I thought; perhaps only because I had no idea I would have to do this atleast 3 to 4 times a day in the coming months (and maybe for the rest of my life), which I must say does get painful at times, and if not painful, extremely frustrating.  I pricked, drew the blood sample from the tip of my finger with utmost difficulty (a case of cold fingers I guess), dabbed it onto the meter's test strip, and inserted the strip into the device. I remember very clearly, my mom, dad and me, staring at the glucometer for almost 20-25 seconds, which seemed like a lifetime, and I could sense the tension in the air. To our dismay, the glucometer showed an 'Error'. I tried using another blood sample using a different test strip, but the result was the same! However, when we consulted the glucometer manual, we concluded that the reason for the error was nothing but a blood sugar level so high, that the glucometer went out of range!  Although we failed to get an exact blood sugar reading, I was pretty much a confirmed unofficial 'diabetic'. It took me a while to really understand what was happening. There was a short span of time when nobody spoke. The rest of the evening and night was a time spent in long discussions with my family, and the only thing left to do now, on our part, was to visit my family doctor and get a confirmed official diagnosis. There was still a feeling that we would be proved wrong, that my case would turn out into something called 'Pre-Diabetes' (temporary high blood sugar levels which can be brought to normal again). I was myself ready to accept the fact that I might go on some medication for a few days, and things would be back to normal once again.   December 31, 2002   Early morning, my dad and I set off to visit Dr. Anand Gokhale, our family doctor for the past 30 odd years. For Nulkars, Dr. Gokhale is someone who is not just a doctor; the mere mention of his name in the Nulkar household is enough for us to be rid of any sickness in this world.  There are two standard blood tests that are generally carried out to test for diabetes:    I) Fasting Plasma Glucose:   The fasting plasma glucose test is the most preferred way to diagnose diabetes and requires atleast 8 hours of overnight fasting. A single blood sample was drawn at the doctor's clinic and sent to the laboratory for results. Normal fasting plasma glucose levels are between 70 and 110 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl).   II) Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (GTT):   This test is performed after the fasting plasma glucose test. I was given 75 grams of glucose in a sweet tasting liquid (or water). One or more blood samples are then taken two to three hours after this test. The morning of the test, a person should not eat, smoke or drink coffee/tea, and should be in a fairly healthy condition (no cold or flu). The oral glucose tolerance test measures blood glucose levels several times over a period of 2-3 hours. In a person without diabetes, the glucose levels rise and then fall quickly. In someone with diabetes, glucose levels rise higher than normal and fail to come back down as fast. A person is said to have a normal response when the 2-hour glucose level is less than 140 mg/dl, and all values between 0 and 2 hours are less than 200 mg/dl. In my case only one single blood sample was taken, 2 hours after the GTT.  By the time I left for home at 11:30, I was utterly famished. Incidentally, another common symptom of a Type-I patient is increased hunger. I did experience uncontrollable hunger at times; but it did not reach alarming proportions like the other symptoms did.   I was supposed to know the test results by evening, and could hardly wait. In the evening, Dr. Gokhale had bad news for me. My results came as a shocker for everyone, including Dr. Gokhale. My Fasting Plasma Glucose was 260, and the GTT was 340, way higher than anybody expected. (That explained why the glucometer conked off the previous day; I was definitely above 400, atleast!!). There was no doubting the fact that I had developed chronic diabetes, and this was a classic case of Hyperglycemia (the technical term for high blood sugar).  Although I was prepared for the worst, it took some time to sink in when the news actually hit me. Things had happened fairly quickly over the last couple days, and for me it was impossible to fathom what exactly had gone wrong. I tried to think and piece together all the information I had. Like any other patient who is newly diagnosed with a disease/sickness, I was dumbfounded.  In spite of tremendous research on Diabetes - its causes, symptoms, and treatment, doctors still are unable to confirm whether a diagnosis is Type-I or Type-II with these initial results, unless a person suffers from many other serious complications, in which case definite conclusions can be immediately drawn. Before going into details about the types of diabetes in later chapters, for now, simply put: a Type-I patient is insulin-dependent, i.e. he/she needs insulin externally (shots or pump) in order to survive, whereas a Type-II patient can be treated by taking oral pills to control the blood sugar. Since an insulin treatment is considered 'intensive', and has its own initial risk factors, Dr. Gokhale decided to begin with a short 10-day treatment by prescribing some oral pills for me. In the 10 days to follow, if the pills worked in controlling my sugar to normal levels, then I would essentially fall in the category of 90% of diabetics who are Type-II patients. Eventually I would learn that the pills had absolutely no effect in controlling my blood sugar.   January 10, 2003   On January 10, exactly 10 days after I went on oral pills, I was officially diagnosed as a Type-I patient. This was again, based on the blood sugar tests done on the glucometer. Following were the exact readings I got on the three days prior to my confirmation as an Insulin-Dependent Diabetic.  January 08 - Random Test: 372 January 09 - Fasting Plasma Glucose: 237 January 10 - Post Breakfast (2 hours after breakfast): 378 January 10 - Post Prandial (2 hours post-lunch): 277  The results showed that the pills did nothing to achieve any sort of control, not even the slightest of improvements in my condition. The reason being that pills work only in the presence of insulin in the body, even if there's a small amount. The fact that the pills failed was proof enough that my pancreas produced no insulin, or extremely insignificant amounts of insulin, which the pills could not use.  In the meanwhile I underwent several other tests, to check if my diabetes had caused any other physical complications. This is important, simply because prolonged high sugars if gone un-noticed, may result in life threatening long term complications, and it was essential that I undergo a through medical examination. The history indicated that my diabetes was actually 6 to 8 months old, assuming that was the period when I began suffering all the symptoms, and hence this exam became even more important. Most of the tests fortunately turned out to be normal, namely: Sonography of the pancreas, ECG or Electric Cardio Gram test (detection and diagnosis of heart abnormalities that measures electrical potentials on the body surface and generates a record of the electrical currents associated with heart muscle activity), Kidney and urine tests and a whole lot of others, which can only be understood by medical technicians or doctors. However I had a close call with two other tests. My case was borderline, or slightly over the normal mark, on the 'Thyroid' test, luckily not alarming. And when I did an eye-check up at Dr. Sachin Kale's clinic, I found out that the spherical distance of my right eye had increased from -3.25 to -4.0, and the left eye's distance had gone up from -3.25 to -3.50. Even though my fundus (the part of the eye opposite the pupil) was normal, I was at a stage wherein another few months of high sugar could have resulted in possible retinal damage, a common diabetes complication in older patients. For the time being, I was fortunate to have left the clinic with nothing but a slightly thicker pair of glass lenses! :)    In a sense, when I look back, I think I was extremely lucky to have got diagnosed at the right time. I cannot imagine the physical complications I would have experienced if my condition had gone un-noticed in the USA, i.e. if I had not planned my India trip in January. The creepiest thought that immediately came to my mind when I slowly began to learn about diabetes and its complications was about a condition called as 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis'. Ketones are the acids or toxins that build up in blood, produced when blood glucose rises in the absence of insulin. Large amounts of ketones in the blood can cause a life-threatening problem called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA IS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, a serious condition that can lead to diabetic coma (passing out for a long time) or even death. I know a person who had sugar levels above 600, and at one point, found it difficult even to recognize people! Ketoacidosis may happen to people with Type-I diabetes. Ketones can poison the body. They are a warning sign that your diabetes is out of control. Ketones mean your body is burning fat to get energy. My urine tests did not indicate ketones, but that could have been just the beginning of why I was losing weight even though I was eating much more than normal; I was essentially burning all of my fat!  Moderate or large amounts of ketones in the urine are dangerous. They upset the chemical balance of the blood. Ketoacidosis usually develops slowly, but when vomiting occurs continuously, it may turn serious in a matter of hours. The other symptoms generally are: increased thirst/dry mouth, frequent urination, tiredness, dry/flushed skin, nausea/vomiting/abdominal or stomach pains, hard time breathing, paying attention or utter confusion. I was already experiencing half of the above symptoms. I also realized that the harsh winter in the USA had added to my dry skin problem even though it never bothered me, and as for tiredness, I remember having a hard time concentrating during my classes at times; even dozed off on occasions. In the end, managed to perform well though! ;) Moreover, I am still bewildered as to why I considered myself 'fit as a fiddle' even after knowing these symptoms.   To me, whatever happened during those first two weeks in India seemed a miracle, nothing short of a bad dream, a bad dream that would eventually change a lot of things for me, albeit positively. Those two weeks were nothing but sleepless nights and frustrating days at the doctors' clinic, and spent largely over 'Diabetes Education  Awareness' as well as with retrospection.  In the next chapter I plan to discuss more details about Diabetes and the beginning of my new life as an IDDM patient.  >>  urlLink [Chapter 2 - The Disease]  >>  urlLink [Chapter 3 - The Sweet Legacy]
