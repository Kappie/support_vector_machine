Timberwolves stuck it to the Lakers last night while I was at work...barely! Come on guys, defeat the Lakers!    I need to take more English courses and hopefully by winter I will be on the college newspaper. Then they will see what it looks like when an adult writes, not a bunch of kids writing about happy meals and other waste of time subjects.   Keep Hope Alive....For me winning the lottery!
