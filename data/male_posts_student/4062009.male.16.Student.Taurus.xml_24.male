And because of that, she didn't come to the classroom while I was there which means I would have been late to my Homeroom if I didn't leave when I did. How great is that, right?  Anyway, today wasn't so bad. Though it was a bit boring and I was dozing off in Physics today, it wasn't to bad. The school computer dude finally got our logins working so we can now get in to the school network there and do some actual web design work. Plus, I have some homework that is not due until Monday which means I get a free day in those classes tomorrow, Yeah!  Besides today, tonight hasn't been bad for homework either. I managed to type a really good, or what I think is really good, essay for class tomorrow. (I'm one of those last minute doers... lol) So i hope i get some good comments about it and a good grade. Otherwise, I am screwed! LOL! Anyway, I am going to go now. Later!    Wolfwood
