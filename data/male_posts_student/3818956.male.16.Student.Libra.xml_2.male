It's basically my way of saying "remember me" to all those people I don't see anymore or won't be seeing cause of things like college or work or something.  Okay so, today, although just as long as every other work day, seemed to go pretty quickly. The sunburn did put a small damper on my chipper mood (you know, from waking up at 5:40), but I got over that, because I had no choice.   (Holy Random Part Batman! I just turned on TV Land and guess what show is on? ALF! Yes, Gordon Schemway himself is on TV. Great stuff.)  Ok, back to my day. Basically all of it was work, work, work. However, I did go to Burger King and used my Spidey Sense to win me a free small hash browns. Whoopie.
