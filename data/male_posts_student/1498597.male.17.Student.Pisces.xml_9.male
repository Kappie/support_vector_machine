That means I will be leaving soon so that she doesn't get to the corner and think that I forgot about her! Ha ha.  Today  JR  is coming over to my house. We are going to take some pictures for this blog, so it will be REALLY cool! Yay! I am going to teach him how to use HTML (the image portion). That should be fun, it will be something to look forward to this afternoon. Yay!  Now, lets get this day started!!!! :)
