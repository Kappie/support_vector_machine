It is better for the reason that it isnt a wagon but the only thing i hate about it is that it has 2 doors. 2 Door cars are so damn annoying. The plus to having this smaller car is that i cant lug around 9 ppl in my car anymore coming home from firework showings and passing about 13 million cops with a fear of being pulled over everytime. All in all i am very pleased with my new car the only thing i need to put into it now is a CD player and i will be set. I also want louder/better speakers in the car so i can really blast my music and make myself go deaf at a much earlier age. This is Dr.SMUT saying " GO FUCK YOURSELVES SAN DIEGO"
