The students there were held there for hours until they were let go from the lock down.  Unfortunately, there are no signs of Anthony Castellanos, the suspected murderer. 1     I wonder how it felt to be in the midst of that kind of person.  Knowing that at any moment, Castellanos may burst through the door and start shooting.  I was only in Mark Keppel for a week, so I was lucky; but all of my friends weren't.  They were terrified, but now they're back home, safe at last.    They recalled first hearing about the shootings at Columnbine, of course they were scared also, but nobody had actually experienced the feeling.  I really hope Temple City will never have to.     1  Pasadena Star News. URL:  urlLink  http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/Stories/0,1413...
