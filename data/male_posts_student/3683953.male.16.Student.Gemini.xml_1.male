Then I got on the internet and just started talkin to Mike and Charlie. I had very nice conversations with both of them.  Then Charlie came up with this idea that I should call him. Now see, here was the problem with that, he lives in Arizona, so that would've meant I was making a LONG-DISTANCE CALL. So i was like oh f*** it, and just called him anyway. It was pretty fun. (THE TRUTH: I was so nervous. I was pacing back and forth in my room the whole time. I think you could even hear how nervous I was by the sound of my voice. AHHH! That's the only thing that gives away my nervousness (LOL), my voice.) So that only lasted about five minutes, but it was pretty fun nonetheless.  Let's see , then I continued chatting with Mike and then Brad came online, so I talked to them both. I didn't even get enough nerve to call my cousin that lives in Cleveland, I was so scared. I mean, I haven't seen or spoken to they guy in like 6 years, so how would that look if I all of a sudden just called him one random day?    (Day turns into night) Then it got dark, and I was still bored. So then that meant more internet. YAY! Luckily there were people online to talk to. I talked to Richard for a quick second. He said his brother totalled his car, and that really sucks. But hey, at least he gets a new one, so that's not that bad. Then Mike came on, and I started talkin to him again. It was pretty cool. I've never had two conversations with him in one day. Hehe. Then.........(dun dun dunnnnn)...my mom came in my room, and told me to start lookin for plane tickets for our "supposed" vacation. And I'm all thinkin in my head " Damn! I was havin a good conversation with my friends, and then you just barge in like that. GRRRR! " Ya, considering I'm "not out" to the rents yet about my sexuality, they'd have my head on a platter if they knew that I was socializing with gay people. That's one thing they told me not to do, and I do it anyway (oh well, f*** it). My mom (especially) is the one who stresses on it the most. Here's an example: one day she just barged in my room, grabbed my cell phone, and started deleting all my friends' numbers who   she   thought were gay. That got me really mad, but of course I couldn't say anything, so you could probably imagine my reaction in my head.    Anyways, ya, plane tockets. OMG, that took forever. She made me look for tickets to Niagara Falls and New York City. She was so damn picky with everything. Ahhh! (And Mike, if you're reading this, I hope you didn't think I was ignoring you, because I wasn't trying to, it's just my mom, she.....ya. So sorry about that.) And then in the end, when I found a really good deal on both places, and had everything ready to be bought for, she didn't buy them. So that pissed me off, cuz it was like a total waste of time, because the prices change with every hour.   Oh and if you guys are wondering how I'm feeling, I still feel the same as yesterday. It's just so hard to forget about him. He's constantly in my mind and that just makes the whole situation even worse.  Song of the Day: UNWELL - MATCHBOX TWENTY
