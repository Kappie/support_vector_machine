Then after waking up, having to listen to them argue like children-and this occurs on an almost daily basis. I could shut them up by telling them they're behaving like children instead of adults but I'm too tired to. And anyway it seems insignificant to what's happened this morning-yeah Eddie's mum died of cancer this morning... it'd be nice if you ppl could pray for his family in their time of need.  mmm i betta go bak and *try* working.
