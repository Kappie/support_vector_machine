I've got something to day, I raped your mother today, and it doesn't matter much to me, as long as she's spread, sweet, lovely death, I'm waiting for your breath, please give me one last caress.  I've got something to say, I killed your baby today, and it doesn't matter much to me, as long as it's dead, sweet lovely death, I'm waiting for your breath, please give me......oooone last caress one last caress, one last caress.   An...uhm... interesting  song by NOFX I thought I would share with you all, Have fun trying to interpret it in your own ways.
