I see: My computer screen, with this window and my buddy list and a Notorious L.O.R. chat and part of my direct on which PJ commented. I need: Oxygen, nutrients, air pressure. I find: That I am a little thirsty but not at all hungry. I want: I'll save this answer for more to-the-point questions. I have: Several things. I wish: I don't really wish.  I plan. I love: Things- food.  Places- Boston, Cambridge, North, my room.  People- again, I'll save this for later. I hate: CompuUncoolGeoGorge, at times. I miss: One of my choices, when I learned that choice was otherwise occupied. I fear: Not much.  I just have concerns. I feel: Your mother last night.  Yeah, I know, that's kind of plagiarizing Loren.  Apathetic but a little jolly. I hear: Music. I smell: That kind of air smell that you smell when you're a little sick.  Hard to explain. I crave: Teriyaki chicken. I search: For academic performance and for some chickens.  Chickens...get it...chicks... I wonder: About my future in both spectra.  See above. I regret: The HMUN thing.  That's the only thing that comes to mind.  When was the last time you ...  Smiled: An hour ago, when I was with the New England Retired Decorated Salamander (acronym). Laughed: Then. Cried: Not for a long, long time.  Speaking of which, I was watching "L'Empire Contre-Attaque" on Quebecois TV in Vermont the other day, and in the beginning they were like "Une age longtemps, tres longtemps." Bought something: A few hours ago, for the French people. Danced: Eighth grade. Kissed someone: Many years, if you're talking about that kind of kissing.  This was back when I was a playa. Talked to an ex: Not really applicable, unless you're talking about what I was just talking about. Watched your favorite movie: I think like two years ago. Had a nightmare: Last night, but that doesn't really count.  We had to write a bunch of paragraphs during class for English in my dream, but then the teacher was talking and I wasn't writing that much and then the period ended.  I was just a little apprehensive.  A last time for everything ...  Last book you read: If you mean last book you finished, then Black Boy.  Right now I'm slowly reading "Rise to Rebellion" about the American Revolution and if I read it slowly enough I can bring it to France and flaunt my Americanism. Last movie you saw: "Paycheck," a few hours ago. Last song you heard: "Sit Down, John," from "1776." Last thing you had to drink: Coca-Cola.  I just wrote "Coca-Coca" by mistake and then fixed it. Last time you showered: I bathe... so not in a long time. Last thing you had to eat: This ice-creamoid dish.  Do you ...  Smoke: Not likely. Do drugs: Not since I had whooping cough, which I didn't. Have sex: Um...with other people?  Just kidding.  Not ever. Sleep with stuffed animals: No. Live in the moment: Not really.  I plan things the day before, but I still take the initiative when the time comes, even when it's unnerving.  Wait a minute, if you say "unnerving" shouldn't you say that you're "unnervous"? Have a boyfriend/girlfriend: Not yet. Have a dream that keeps coming back: No. Play an instrument: I used to. Believe there is life on other planets: Yes, there is probably life on at least a couple of other planets.  But in my opinion, it'd probably just be like one-celled amoebae that aren't very interesting. Remember your first love: Yes. Still love him/her: No.  That was a looooong time ago. Read the newspaper: Only the comics and the "Ideas" section in the Sunday paper. Have any gay or lesbian friends: I know people who I think might be gay. Believe in miracles: No.  Stupid Jesus. Believe it's possible to remain faithful forever: Yes, regardless about what you're faithful to.  But not if it's a change from something else. Consider yourself tolerant of others: Pretty much, if you're talking about race and ethnicity and sexual orientation and stuff.  But that doesn't mean I don't dislike people. Consider love a mistake: No.  We gots to propagate the species.  Go humans! Like the taste of alcohol: Does anyone? Have a favorite candy: Yes, Hershey's, but I haven't had any in a while. Believe in astrology: No.  Not by a long shot.  Bill Nye and Carl Sagan agree, it's a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that they make really vague so you can't disprove it.  That's like saying that God is the Father, the Son, AND the Holy Ghost.  Pick one and stick with it. Believe in God: Well, yes and no.  I'm a pantheist, which means that I believe in God but basically think that the universe is God.  I'm also a humanist. Pray: Jews don't really pray in the Christian sense.  Except Christianized Jews, like Reform Jews.  Daniel Waldinger, I'm looking at you. Go to church: I'm...Jewish... but I go to synagogue on holidays and I follow all of the stuff. Have any secrets: Not...really...not that is unique to me. Have any pets: Yes.  Go Hanne. Do well in school: Fairly well. Go to or plan to go to college: You bet your sweet diddy.  Whatever that means. Have a major: I'm in high school... but it's probably going to be something like pre-law or some historical or writing-related thing. Talk to strangers who instant message you: Nope.  Why do people have SmarterChild on their buddy lists? Wear hats: No sir or ma'am. Have any piercings: Those are so stupid.  Even for girls. Have any tattoos: Not by a long shot.  "You've spent more money on temp tattoos than on gifts for me!" "But Marge, it's worth it, check out the Taco Bell dog! What the?  Here boy!  Here boy!  Aw, it's gone." Hate yourself: Never myself specifically. Have an obsession: Not right now, but I have them from time to time. Have a secret crush: Is it secret if six people know? Do they know yet: You do realize that this category started out with "Do you..." so that makes this full question "Do you do they know yet."  Anyway, no SHE doesn't, you can never correctly use "they" when talking about one person, even if you don't want to be gender-specific.  But according to Kevin, "There is no change without action," so she should know by Monday the 12th. Collect anything: Non, as they say en France. Have a best friend: Like Loren, I don't really have a best friend, but I have a hierarchy of friends with a few top friends. Wish on stars: That's almost as bad as astrology or Christianity. Like your handwriting: No, but I like my signature. Have any bad habits: As Loren said, that's just being a guy.  I have some habits that are probably not ideal but they work for me. Care about looks: My own?  Somewhat. Boy/girlfriend's looks: Not...applicable... but I care about the looks of potentials. Friends and other people: No, not really. Believe in witches: Only that those Goths think they're really cool when they say "I'm a witch!  That's why I don't know how to dress!" Believe in Satan: I'm Jewish.  Not by a long shot. Believe in ghosts: No, but according to my reasoning, we have like a 30% chance of reincarnation.
