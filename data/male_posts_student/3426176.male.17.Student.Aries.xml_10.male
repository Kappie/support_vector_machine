Usually completing a final would be something to be excited about, but I knew that when I finished the exam and the bell rang I would never see most of the seniors ever again, for today was the senior's last day.   It was strange to see so many empty seats in physics class.  Most of the seniors didn't have to take the final exam.  A few did though, and for them it was just another physics class period.  Talking about the Sox, talking about movies, talking about college, talking about nothing in general, and making jokes was all that happened.  Oh yeah, and something about a final, but no one really paid any attention to that.  Yup, same old, same old.   The rest of the day went on as planned until 7th period ended.  I was walking back to my locker where I saw my good friend and lab partner Michele.  I knew this would be the last time I would ever see her so I made sure I gave her a nice good-bye.  She summed it up really well when she said that she would most likely never see me again and she wished me a good life.  It was a hurried good-bye because she was going one way and I was headed another.  I guess that could be perceived as a nice symbolic ending to a friendship.   So there I was in trigonometry class.  I was ready to finish the final, but not the class.  Over the past months, some of the best times of the year were made in that class.  The best part about it was I contributed to the good times.  Usually I'm just an observer who watches the good times, but I made many of them happen in this class.  I was known as "weird kid".  Never had I been known for anything in any other class.  It really felt good to open up and be noticed.   So there I was at my desk working hard on the final.  With about five problems to go I looked at my watch and it read 14:10.  That's 2:10 pm if you don't speak European.  So with only 10 minutes left a thought came to me.  In 10 minutes I will never see most of the people in this class ever again.  It's a harsh reality when you see them everyday for nine months and suddenly they are gone.  In fact, I've known some of them two or even three years.  It is naturally hard to say good-bye to so many people you have come to know and grow close to for so long.  It will be even harder next year when I have to say good-bye to everyone I know, good friends and all, not just a select group of people that I knew from a few classes.  But as I like to think, the hard times in one's life can not be stopped.  They will come.  It is how you handle them and get past them that makes you who you are and makes you better.  When the bell eventually rang and I turned in my test and I went back to my desk and just stood there and took one last look at everyone for the last time.  I guess this really was it.  I wanted to say bye to everyone, but most of everyone was still taking the test so I didn't.  I wish I did.  I did give Bux a good handshake and "man-hug" so I felt good that I at least did that.   That was that.  Good-bye to every one who made going to class a lot more enjoyable.  Good-bye to everyone who made homework, tests, and grades a little less of a burden.  Good-bye to Kate, Michele, Jon, Kevin, Bux, Steve, Amy, Kris, Andy, Missy, Blondie, Chris, Chuckie, Rocky, Brandon, Bond, Dana, Magpie, Gina, and everyone else I shamefully forgot to mention.  However we knew each other, whether it was from soccer, to physics, to math, to other subjects or activities, thanks to you all.  I don't know if you feel the same about me, but you all made life a little bit better for me for that short time we knew each other.  Thanks a lot and good luck to you all.   Now I have that damn Green Day song in my head.
