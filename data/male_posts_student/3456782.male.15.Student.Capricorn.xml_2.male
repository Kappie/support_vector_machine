Even though I won't actually be driving for several years. but that's not the point, the point is not that I'm driving, it's that I'm driving age. Pure cool. Hmm, seems like such a waste.    I remember once, when Amir was over at my house, his cell' phone had an internet connection, so we were at  urlLink Pick the Hottie , and we were discussing whether or not we should stay up all night. Amir asked what time it was, and I told him that it was six o'clock in the morning (I didn't actually say, "in the morning" because I think he realized that it was already the morning). He replied, "Everyone's going to come through here and make lots of noise and wake us up in two hours anyway, so we might as well stay up." I replied, "OK," turning back to the phone, "which one is hotter, first or second?" There was a pause. "Amir?"  That isn't the first time that happened either. Once, he and I were discussing how to go about writing a certain algorithm for a 3D engine, I asked him a question, and he replied, "Let me think with my eyes closed." Pause. "Amir?"  That's Amir for yeh.
