But some things...well...with friends I refuse to be selfish, to talk about myself when there's better things to talk about...but...sometimes I really feel like   I want people to know things  , and yet I don't want people to know, and at the same time I want to prove to myself that I can actually do something...that's why I turned to poetry. In poetry...anything to   make the poem sound nice .  I don't know...   I spent about 45 minutes talking to Alex Miramontes after tutoring. I never imagined how so many people I thought I kinda knew -- or at least who I thought   had direction in their life   -- are stoners/boozers/sluts/whatever. And all I worry about is like, finals and spring sports.   I take things for granted sometimes  ...One thing I learned about myself today is that I'm a listener. I don't mind hearing people talk...as long as   they want to say something, I want to listen  . If anyone has anything they need to talk about...I don't know what people think of me, but I would be happy to help people out any way I could.   Being the speaker, I feel like I'm wasting people's time sometimes, but having someone talk to me and them knowing that someone would be willing to give up some of their time for them, that's what I'd rather do. And if they need help or whatever, I'm there to give it. Honestly, I'd bend over backwards to   smash a spider that's 10 feet away   just cause it scared a friend. That's me, I guess. I would put you guys first any day. Even at my expense. I could be kinda low and down, but if everyone else is perfectly   content and happy with life  , that's my reward.
