It should be an interesting summer at the very least....there are some of the usual suspects....the girls with bad attitudes....the guys who plan to pull all the females....and now I have this new role as the Teacher....yeah...I'm teaching Math to these undergrad rascals....like i said...should be interesting....  So I just got back from eating Indian food with Beth and Jylana....Jylana was driving my dream car....all I could think about was changing the color to that cold ass grey and keeping the drop top down....dinner was good although we were left in questioon about our "non" (unclear about the spelling)....they brought out some tortilla like substance and we were like "surely they jest"....after a while they brought out the real "non"....I enjoyed the meal and the company :-)  Well I have another long day ahead of me tomorrow....
