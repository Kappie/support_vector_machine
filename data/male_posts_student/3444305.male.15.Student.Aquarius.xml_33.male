Yesterday all I did was go to Vacation Bible School, go to peoria with my mom, sister, and brother, get godfathers pizza, and then eat it, and then watch "O". That was really about it. Today, I got up, went to Vacation Bible School, got home from that and did... absolutely nothing. I just sat at home. I walked up to the pool because it stoped raining and it was actually pretty warm, but it was closed. How stupid is that. The pool is getting worse and worse with this new managment. First the picture IDs and now this. They are killing me here. So after that I took my dog on a walk. She is sycko, i don't think thats how you spell it. But she would like run all over the place and almost choke herself to death on her leashe. I think she would finally get the point that she can't get away from it. Even with bitting it. Wow freaky. Then I got home, and just did nothing. After that me and my family finally decided to go get a movie. Well by now it was storming like crazy. And my mom felt like going to the Dollar General to buy some cheap stuff. So we drove her all the way down there, and my dad wanted to go trade in his change jar for money. So we go to Cefcu. And by now it was crazy crazy outside. And I mean crazy. The roads were like rivers. But, its pooring down rain, and my dad goes to go to the bank. Well he runs to the door, and he tries to open this automatic door, and it won't open, so he runs back. By now me and my brother are just dieing laughing. He is soaked from being out in the rain for just like 30 seconds. But we guess the bank just closed randomly. There were other people there, and they were doing the same thing. No one knows why it was closed. I guess it was just one of lifes mysteries. Even the drive thru's were closed. Freaky. But then we go back to get my mom, she bought an umbrella there and so she used that to walk the litterlly 2 feet she had to. But if she wouldn't of, she would have been drenched. Then, we went to 2nd Cinema, and just my luck, all the movies I wanted were out on DVD and even Video. So yeah, Brent didn't get a movie, but Nathan, my mom, and my dad all did. So that wasn't cool. So I come home and burn 15 CD's because I'm goning to reformat my PC tomorrow and I don't want to lose my 110 music albums I have on it. So yeah, I burned many CDs. Then I just talked to KLT on the phone, and looked and hilarious college quotes. I showed them to Andrew and we both got a kick out of them. But when I was on the phone with KLT. She proclaimed God is a Cross Dresser, and is sexists. But then she says she thinks God is a girl. She is one crazy lady. What would I do without you KLT. But now I am just watching Jay Leno, Vin Disel is on. He is one muscular guy. He could break me like a stick. I should be in bed by now, but oh well. I have to get up tomorrow like at 7:00 then go to church, and I have to do the Response Sorial Psalm. And watch little kids. Wow, not gonna work well. But oh well. Well, I need to at least go get ready for bed. This girl on Jay Leno, I can't tell if I think she is hott or just looks to hott which could make her ugly. It's wierd. Well I really need to go. Nite
