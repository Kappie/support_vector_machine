My oldest brother took his computer so I had nothing to do (lacking cable and a decent stereo) so I just sat around bored for a few hours untill my mom got home from Los Vegas (of course, she was bitching about getting money from my aunt...). So, after comign home and getting bitched at for being born, I sat at my compute for a while and got reallybored again. I decided that Debbie (the best friend) and I should go out and see a movie. It was already kinda late, but we made plans and Debbz had the great idea of inviting Brittney so I did. Well, everything went downhill from there... Debbie and I got there 10 minute late while Brittney got there 10 minutes early. Franny ( a friend of my who works at the show) told Brittney that I had already come and gonefo no apparent reason. I talked to Brittney on the phone for like 12 seconds in the theater, but either we got disconnected or she hung up on em (probably the latter). It's now a bit after 2 and I'm giving up on her calling tonight. I wish she'd get her cell back so we could talk like we used to. Oh well... good night... to the millions of non-people who read this
