I am new to this so it will take me a while to find new cool additions to post on my blog, but for the meantime, what you see is what you get.  I will post stuff about whatever I want.  Rants, random observations, news, personal stuff, and anything else in my slightly deranged mind.  I will try and post pictures as well.  I hope you will enjoy it.  Tell your friends about it too.
