The pain of knowing that you are no longer here hurts me up to the fact that I didn't get to know you very well...  You left without even saying goodbye and I hated that...  I wanted to know more about you but I was denied of the chance...  Damn it!  Why haven't I done anything to prevent it...  Now you are gone and I could never see you again.  I thought that we'll remain in contact with each other, no matter what but distance really drew us apart...  Now all I could do is reminisce about what happened between us and daydream what might have happened...  Damn you...  How could you have such an effect on me, I met and saw so many beautiful women and girls in my life that it shouldn't even bother me anymore but you really left this hole in me...  Your beauty, your kindness, the way that you initiated a conversation with me, you always gave me a hug while most girls just don't notice me at all or basically snob at me...  I should hate you for that but I don't...  I keep on loving you because you were the one that gave me this happiness of having a girl finally noticing me despite my appearance...  The fact that you noticed made me content with who I was, despite the fact that I will never be good-looking or that I never deserved such a happiness as to have met you...  You talked to me...  You've given me so much while I haven't given anything at all...  You, who were so generous as to have given so many experiences and happiness, deserve to receive so many beautiful things in this world...  I should have been able to give you something for your work but I was too selfish...  All I could do now is contemplate about what I have done wrong and that I never gave you anything, only idiotic things, what a fool I am...  Please forgive me for what I have done, you never deserved such mistreatment but I gave it to you...  I'm so sorry.  I want to make it up to you if ever we meet again...  Whether it's this life or on another...  I will recompensate anything that I am able to just to see you as happy and content as I was when I first met you when you gave me a truly memorable hug...  The hug given to me by the most beautiful girl that I have ever met in my whole life.  The one that I keep on dreaming to see someday again...
