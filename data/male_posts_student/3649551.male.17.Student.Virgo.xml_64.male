Get this: this paper paid $50 for a 13-inch story, which is about 500 words! Fifty freakin dollars! I've written somewhere around 20,000 words on this blog. Divide that by 500 and you get 40. Multiply that by 50 and you have $2000. Too bad I don't get paid for this - I'd be rich. Richer at least. Like $2000 richer. Which is a lot of money compared to what I'm sitting on. Child support money isn't so bad, though. Free money. Ha.
