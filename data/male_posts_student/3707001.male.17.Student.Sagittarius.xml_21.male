Or maybe my slightly sprained ankle had something to do with it. Anyways, 7:30ish, I was at my comp... I opened an email from a special somebody but didnt reply to it yet... I wanted to save it for later when I was fully awake and was missing her even more. O ya... 2:30 am send time...? Very disappointed...jks    Hmm... Matt came online and we talked about tmr... I'm really looking forward to our date!!! I mean... uh... :$... hahaha, jks. 11... EB... I'll be there ;) (I hope I dont forget those games!) Hmm... some1 else came online and we spoke for a lil bit... then they both left me alone on msn. That's when I replied to that email, when I missed her the most knowing that I coulda spent an afternoon wit her >.   This friend is my 23 yr old friend from work. Hes really cool, very down-to-earth and open-minded. He's also the one who was seeking guidance in his choice of UTSC or work. Well we decided to go to... arghh... forgot the name. But it was (something, something) of the Nazerene I think. Well the "Nazerene" part or some other form of that word was in it and it kinda worried me. I had no idea what to expect. My friend said that the name of the head of the church was Pastor something, so that comforted me cuz it reminded me of Forward. When we arrived... the church building itself was very nice. It has very white walls, stained glass windows on the side and a large cross on the front. The parking lot was VERY large and had been freshly painted. My fears of looking outta place were also subsided as I watched a brown family and some azns walk in. As we walked through the main glass doors, I noticed that the church from inside the foyer was very small... well not that small... cozy. As we walked into the auditorium (I guess its called) I noticed that the layout was similar to ours. They had a very large projector screen on the back, a drum set, an organ or piano, a podium, and some mics and music stands for the singers. As I sat down I noticed that they had nice cloth seats. Sorry to say but they are alot more comfortable than the wooden ones at FBC. When the service started, there were only about 3o ppl there. It was very empty but at the same time it gave me the feeling that I was part of a close family rather than a congregation. The pastor there was very upbeat, he always had a smile on his face which. My friend described it like he looked like he won the lottery the whole time. Well God's glory, salvation, grace, etc. is worth SOO much more than that so I'm sure thats the high he was on. The pastor also had soothing voice... like something u'd hear on the radio or one of those relaxation tapes that you listen to while u sleep. He also had a very full, booming singing voice to go with it. Unfortunately this voice started to annoy pretty soon, at the end of the song he would repeat the last verse or the chorus EXTRA slow... like he wanted to show off or something (not that that was what he was doing... he wanted us to "reflect" on the song and what we're singing)... and I always felt like he was screaming into the mic.    LOL... funny thing... after a few hymns and a prayer... a lady went up to the front and asked for all visitor to stand up and introduce themselves. So one lady who was already a member introduced a family whose father was a pastor from Guyana... and he told everyone that when all else fails to put all ur faith in God. Then some1 else introduced their nephew and some1 else whoI believe was going to church for the first time. I was hesitant to stand up before but how could I follow those 2?? Well they asked one more time for visitors before finally saying, "Well for all those SHY people **stares at my friend and I** welcome to (name of church) and I hope (something, something)" hahaha, like she literally stared RIGHT AT US!! Well more at my friend but we're a group so its still us. Anyways, after that some1 preached a message about parents leading your children to Christ. Even tho it wasnt meant directly towards me, I still got some encouragement. But it was the fact of being in God's house which get my feelings up. Not that I was feeling particularily depressed, just that God brightens my day like nothing else!!!    At the end of the service... I witnessed as a few ppl accepted Jesus for the first time. That makes me feel so warm inside, that some1 elsehas just receivedthe same hopes and joy as I do. Then we sang another hymn and the Pastor invited all the visitors to proceed to the back after the service and get our pics taken. Well most of u know how much I hate pics of myself, and I had no idea why they wanted one. My friend wanted to go but after he spoke to the guest family from Guyana, in particular the Pastor/father. He asked him the differences between catholicism, baptism, and "Nazerenism" (haha, prolly not real word). He didnt really gimme a satisfactory answer, he said that his faith his a "holiness" faith and is based very much on confessions and something like that. I already can see the dif b/w catholics and baptists/Nazerenes but I couldnt decipher the difference between them and us. O well, Christianity is all the same ^.^    Today was a very good day...    Tmr is gonna be great too... ya Matt!!!  See ya later  Missin ya alrdy   Warren    [18]
