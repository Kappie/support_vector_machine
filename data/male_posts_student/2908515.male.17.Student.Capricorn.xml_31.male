We planned to do Xanga reading. Which I thought would last longer than it did. It only lasted a few minutes. Ten or so. I didn't have that many Xanga (Xunga) entries about him that were too interesting. Unlike here. When we were done, it was kinda awkward. I was so nervous and I felt embarrassed kinda to have him in my room. I don't know. A room is where a person goes to get away from it all. And its weird. In a good way. A totally good way. I tried to show him stuff in my room. Which was fun.   We then decided to go to the farm park to do some hardcore discussion. Which I was also nervous about. We arrived, he drove. We sat on a park bench. And it was silent. This is the bad part, actually. The worst part of the day.  You know how people believe in karma?  How for there to be good there will have to be equal?  Newton?  Keep that in mind.  Anyway. It seems that we switched sides. I said that I no longer thought it was so wise to get involved in anything. And he thought it would be cool to get involved in something. And that was where there was a silence. Friction. Which I felt bad about.  I mean, I have always wanted to be something with him. And he has always been anti-that. Which I sorta accepted. So I expected him to be firm on his beliefs. I mean, thats what I predicted. And he would agree with me since I took so much time to try to change my point of view. Painfully. But it wasn't like that. At all. And he was sad. I hated that smile he has when he's dissappointed. And he kinda pouts and acts weird. Which is very bad. Bad.    I guess now that I think about it, I really wanted to be sure that I wanted something with him.  I thought that if I had "tested" this out, to see if Matt really wanted and felt strongly about wanting a relationship.  I certainly didn't want just a fling or a "sex" buddy.  Even if we're not going all the way.  You know?  Its like, I intended to say the complete opposite of what he was saying.  Because I wasn't sure of many things.  I wasn't sure of how much he wanted a relationship.  I wasn't sure of how much he felt for me.  I wasn't sure of all that.    But it showed that he felt a lot of about me.  And he wanted this relationship badly.  Proof.  His face was so sad and dissappointed.  Like he couldn't have something good.  And that showed to me that he really really wanted this relationship.  However, at the same time, he didn't force me at all.  He accepted what I had to say and cares about me enough to trust me to make my own decision.  He cared about me enough to suppress his feelings and act "okay" which i felt was really sweet.  Although painful.    Matt, if you're reading this.  Well, when you read this, I have to say that I am very sorry what I had put you through.  I just didn't know you well enough.  Well, I did but I didn't.  Strange, huh?  Well, our relationship is strange.  I am sorry for making you sad.  I am sorry for crushing you.  But I had to do it to be sure.   We  had to look at the bad side of things, at the "No" before the "Yes." and that was essentially what I was doing.  Although I didn't clue you in on it.  I just felt that maybe if I told you, you would act differently.  But I see that you really wanted this bad and that you really care about me.  And I appreciate that a lot.      I have no problem seeing myself in your arms for the rest of my life.  No problem at all.    Anyway...  We went to the mall. Plymouth Meeting. To look for mood rings. We found some. But they didn't have the correct sizes and the correct style. I mean, they had my size but they didn't have matching styles for the both of us. So close yet so far. But all the while at the mall, Matt was sad and smiling. Which I didn't like. I wanted to hold him. Or have him hold me. Or something. To make things better for him. I care about him a lot.  We had pizza. I said he had nice eyes. Which made him uncomfortable. Well, he was staring at me. And I had no choice but to look into his eyes. And he really did have awesome eyes. I could stare into them all day. And by this time, I was thinking that maybe something with this guy wasn't so bad. Not so bad at all.  We got into the car to go home. And I just let it all out. Forget what I said. Forget I said that it wouldn't be so wise to be anything. We're going to get hurt anyway. Which was his reasoning. If its going to hurt anyway, why not? But I didn't like that. Not really. I wanted something. I wanted something. I made him promise that we can break this off when he leaves and we can "resume" it later. I made him promise. We can resume it. Later. Which was what I wanted. You see, at first, I wanted to wait until we were older. I still do. But I want something now too. And it was the best of both worlds for me. And hopefully him too.   Well, he accepted.  And he took my hand.  And it was good.  Karma.  For  you.  I love you Newton.  He was so happy. Which made me happy. I was also happy because I had an awesome guy. I had him. And I was so happy. It just cannot describe it. Beyond Happiness. Beyond.  We went back home and we talked. Unfortunately, we couldn't hold hands or anything. It was my house. We made a list of the things we should do in the future. And we got to number 10 until we decided to take a break and read those hypothetical questions from a book I have. And that was fun. My parents left so I had to wait until my parents returned until I can go somewhere more alone with Matty. And that came in due time.  We decided to go to a park near my house. Walking. We sat near a stream. And it was silent too. But a good silence. I like this silence. It was awkward since you know, we're together then. "Officially" but I didn't know what to do. I was nervous. Flushed with tons of emotions and feelings. Eventually we started to talk and have a good conversation. We moved closer. Held hands. Hugged. I love his stubble on his chin and side of the face. I love that. So much. So much. And we just turned our heads. And kissed. It was so awesome. And it was everything I wanted. He tasted awesome. And good. And awesome. And his hand reached down to my crotch. Although I wanted that a lot. I didn't think it was so appropiate at that very time. I mean, it was public. I wanted him to touch me. And it felt good when he did. It felt awesome. But sometimes you just gotta say no. In a nice way. We will do that in privacy next time. We will. And he understood that. I knew he had an erection. I wanted to reach there too. You know. To feel. But maybe in private. No. We will do it in private. Touching. Sweetness.  karma.  Too much goodness.  I really want to go to his house on Monday. Maybe I will. My parents liked him. Which was good. They said he seemed nicer than all my other friends. Which was good.  I love his chin and his side of the face.  Um, he seems to have a better recollection of things. I mean, yes, I do remember everything that goes on. And I did leave a few things out. Like getting scared when people walked by our spot where we were sitting very suspicously close together. But I didn't think that was too important. Maybe I'll add on more someday.  Anyway, onto a discussion. I think its awesome that we have a relationship. Its amazing. I wanted this for so long. And I finally have it. However, its a bit weird since we're both guys and I don't know who has the role of what. I guess we just take turns. But I will tell him that I do not want him to call me "Baby" or anything. I mean, "Honey" is border line. But I don't want a "Hey Baby" everytime I sign on. I don't. It just feels weird. I like guys because they're guys. I don't like guys because of cocks, although it is a very good bonus. I want him to be as natural to me as possible. You know? Although I love sappy stuff. I like that mushy stuff I don't like to be called "baby" or "doll" or "sugar" or anything. That is it for this particular subject.  Okay. Next. I don't know if I love him. I really really really like him. And as time goes by, I'll think about the rest. Or maybe I shouldn't. Since it will end. I am sure. When he leaves. Maybe I'll like him now and love him later. That seems like an awesome plan. As long as I get to spend more time with him. And kiss. And feel his face.
