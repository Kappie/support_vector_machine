Honestly, that may be the correct answer for some people, particularly those who came to have a relationship with God by examining those arguments (like C. S. Lewis).  My answer is different, though, and I suspect my response probably ought to be along the same lines of most Christians.   The reason I don’t appeal to any arguments for the existence of God is because I did not learn these arguments until much later in my Christian life.  In other words, I clearly believed in the existence of God prior to discovering cogent proofs for God’s existence (and, yes, I believe there a numerous successful arguments for God’s existence).  When I was six years old and committed my life to Jesus, I am certain I did not even know there was a cosmological, teleological, axiological, or any other “-ological” argument for God’s existence.  I would say that I knew God directly.  No argument, no logical proof, no Bayesian formula.  Scripture tells that God, through the work of the Holy Spirit reveals himself to us in a complete way, which gives us assurance of our faith (Rom. 8:15-16; Col. 2:2; 1 Thes. 1:5).  So, how do I know God exists?  I know there is a God because he has revealed himself to me through the Holy Spirit, and through that direct relationship with God, I am aware of his presence.  It is important that I mention a caveat or two about this answer.  First, I don’t expect to use this inner testimony of the Holy Spirit as a convincing way to explain to others why they should believe in God.  Most non-Christians would find such a response to be comical at best.  Second, this does not mean there is no place for the arguments of God’s existence.  The arguments may be useful in showing others powerful and compelling reasons to embrace the Christian worldview (Col. 4:6; 1 Pet. 3:15).  Moreover, these arguments can confirm the inner witness that the Holy Spirit has given Christians.  My point is that these arguments have a lot of good uses, but for me, one of them is not convincing me to believe in God.  The Holy Spirit does that in much more powerful way than any argument can.
