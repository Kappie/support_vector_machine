For starters, I'm picking up some new Paintball equipment, and I need a new goalie mask.Other then that, check out this list of releases-  -Doom 3 (PC, August 3rd) -RB: Black Arrow (X-Box, August 3rd) -Madden 2005 (X-box, August 9th) -ShellShock, Nam '67 (X-Box, August 24th) -Half-Life 2 (PC, September 1st) -CoD: United Offensive (PC, September 14th)  And probably a lot more stuff I can't remember.    Anybody in the market for a new spleen*? How about a kidney? Anyone?     *Spleen only available in the contiguous 48 states and Canada
