For that type of money for a ticket, I expect some serious champaigne...and a hooker to sip it off of.  Second,  it looks like I'm on my way to becoming a 9-11 scholar.  I'm reading "White Noise" right now, and the irony of the main character dreaming up the "department of Hitler studies" is not lost on me.  On Sun. I photocopied the works I will use in my paper and today I went to visit my professor and he had them all laid out on a desk where he and a collegue both stood anaylizing them, there eyes a-glow with the intellectual possibilities.  It scared me a little.  And reminded me why I don't think I could be a "serious" literary academic...cause it ain't that serious.  But if I could get published, that would be way cool.  Saw the Matrix pt. 2 and then 3 two hours later.  3 is better than 2 in my book, but nothin can beat one.  Got that?  I'm off to sleep and rest up for the big day of psych lecture and ice skating.
