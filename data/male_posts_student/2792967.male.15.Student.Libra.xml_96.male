I notice a lady walking next to me, and she askes me for the time. I give it to her. I keep walking and she askes me what a kid is doing in that part of town alone. I guess that I had strayed away from the touristy area. She tells me that I shouldent be around there, and asks me if I needed a tour guide. I told her no, and turned the corner in the direction of where I had started. She then started asking me if I had any money. For some reason, the only times I have coins in my pocket, I have alot, and those times, however infrequent they are, people ask me for money. I give her a few coins, and she says she hears more in my pocket. By this time I had deduced from her slutty cloths and mannerism that she was a whore. I gave her the rest of my money and she finally walked off. Now, normally this would be something to look back on and laugh about, but for some reason it has really unsettled me. I have been uncomfortable all day since that happend. I dont know what it is, but it keeps going through my head, and Im scared. Please help me...
