Then it got contageous, and Karma got depressed. He said he was leaving. And Chi got it too, and he left as well. Then I decided to hop on the bandwagon and threatened to leave as well. I never can tell when we're being serious, but hopfully they'll all be coming back. =/  Anyhow, not going to be around tomorrow. Anniversary thing. Hurrah.
