Here's a really short summary of what's up, but I have to go soon because my dad's being a bit of a hardass about me getting to sleep and justifiably. I've only gotten like 18 hours in the past 4 or 5 days, I forget >_  Anyway, I'm in Watertown (a small city next to Boston) now and I just got back from playing pinball at my friend's place in Cambridge (Right across the river from Boston), which is about 6 miles away from my house. I had a great time, he's a really cool dude and I'll write a nice long post about it and my other adventures tomorrow morning. I wrote a little draft post for myself to remind me of what to write about so I guess that'll have to do for now.  Sorry again for the Sleep-Induced Delay.  That is all. -- Feanor
