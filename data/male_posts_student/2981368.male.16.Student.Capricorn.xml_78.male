Also...Saturday theres the Bristol City game...and then Sunday (or maybe Friday. Or maybe both) a load of badminton. FunfunfunFUNFUN!!!  Today was mostly good. Geog, didn't do ANYTHING of any value. Apart from laugh at Greg eating what looked like crunchy dog food. Hmmmm. History, again, didn't do much. Mostly just sitting back, laughing at feeble attempts at last year 11's N. Ireland cwk. English, wrote a really funny speech about nothing in particular. And despite sitting next to Lucy B, it wasn't too bad a lesson to end the term on. Mostly random jokes, Blackadder impressions, that sorta thing.  Then *dun-dun-duun* orthodonist time! Got to miss Maffs and Science (ha-ha everyone else) just to drive all the way into Bristol, have someone poke round my mouth a bit, then go on a quick job hunting spree. So far I'm stuck between Wyvale GC or Almondsbury GC...any input from anyone would be useful.  And now, I'm gonna go watch s'more quality British comedy. Goodbyeee!
