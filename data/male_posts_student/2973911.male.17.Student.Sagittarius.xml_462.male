Can't the real accountant do the accounting of the questions?  Why am I passing the responsibility anyway?  Why don't you ask with your numbered questions anyway?  Have you visited my site?  www.geocities.com/daem0n_faust  Am I being ridiculously iterative?  Please?  Is it a good server (gmail)?  Should I get one?   Okay, I am happy now.
