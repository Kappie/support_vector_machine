Board decision  It supports some educator's arguments that today's schools are actually as segregated or even more segregated than ever. Segregated for a variety of reasons: huge discrepancy of wealth, economic gap, culture differences, community separations, and continued racial problems and misunderstandings. This culturally, economically, and racially segregated school systems in turn shows up in the huge differences in the "standardized" testing scores. This problem really boggles those "No Child Left Behind" testing conformist's mind and is a threat to their "everybody conform to the same standard" ideology.  I would like to hear everyone's arguments and opinions on this issue.  Thomas Chen
