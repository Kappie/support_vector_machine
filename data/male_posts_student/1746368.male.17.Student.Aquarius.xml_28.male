    
       Well, my mom is playing a game called Golden Sun. She can't get past any certain part of it and keeps asking me for help. It gets annoying after a little while. Also, my teeth hurt for some odd reason. I don't think I did anything to them, they just hurt. I've probably said this before, but my computer needs to be taken out back and shot. It gets on my nerves constantly because it won't stay working for longer than a couple of hours. Unless, I'm not there next to it, then it has no problems what-so-ever.  Dominique still hasn't come home  yet, but I hope she does soon.   My computer is starting to act up again. It whistles (no, not as in a melodic tune; it whistles one continous note and doesn't stop for about 10 minutes), and bugs everyone in the house. Even if I restart my computer, it doesn't stop. Oh yea, it will stop while it is rebooting, but then it starts up again; just when you think it's finished.   Well, that's it for now. Have a great rest of the day. I shall return later with more news (or lack there-of, whichever way you want to look at it).
