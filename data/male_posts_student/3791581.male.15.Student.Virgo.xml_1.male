Oddly enough, as much as I hated it here when we first arrived, this place has grown on me.  We've really enjoyed the community we live in and the wonderful people we've met here.    We're about 90% moved out now.  We had to ask for an extra day to clear out and the Leasing Office Manager has agreed to allow us to turn in the keys on Thursday before end of business at no extra cost.  Whew!  It's amazing how much crap we've accumulated in the past four years of our life - considering we left Toronto with really just our clothes, a handful of Jessica's favorite toys, and a few kitchen necessities.    The goodbyes have been pretty sentimental.  Our friends from church presented us with some really nice gifts for us to remember them by.  You should have seen me - I was one crying mess. I don't do well in the goodbye department.    Earlier this evening, Jay played one last game of ball with his boys.  Our complex has a pretty sweet clubhouse with an indoor basketball court.  After the game, the guys presented Jay with the ball they've been playing with.  I thought that was really sweet.  Jay has invited them to play in Toronto one weekend when we're more settled.   So life on the American side of the border is over and we re-start a new one in our home and native land.  But damn, if the Referendum goes through and the Bloc Quebecois come into power - we're screwed.  And we're packing up our bags and heading south of the US-Canadian border faster than you can say "au revoir".
