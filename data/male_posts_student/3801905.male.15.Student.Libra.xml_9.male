Here's an e-mail he sent me: "noone but a crazy person could see the good in me :)... but, I can't say I'm not flattered....you are always beating your own personal (and world) records for how nice a person can be....I'm serious, until I met you I thought it was humanly possible to be so nice. You constantly outdo yourself....how you manage it, I'll never know."  He's a great guy and I'll miss him heaps when he goes, if you see him around go and give him a huge hug, he deserves it :p  I guess what I really admore about him is his outlook on life, his sense of fun and just the way he goes about everything. Cheers to you , Gideon  ~Paul
