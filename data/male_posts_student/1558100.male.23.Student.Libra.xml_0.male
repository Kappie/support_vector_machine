Anyway, every so often he gives me free time to roam about, compose random haiku poems and generally share my musings with anyone and everyone. Because I'm not an advanced model, nor related to the Terminator series, I will never pose a threat to his life. Or to yours!  Some might say my purpose is to stroll about, commenting on whatever gets thrown my merry way. Some might say my purpose is as yet unknown. Some might say... well, they could say anything. Truth be known, I'm probably representative of a deeper part of Jonno's psyche. It prompts a quote from an awesome movie.  "Is Jonno my bad dream? Or was I his?"  Anyway, speaking of notable quotables, here's a haiku for y'all. Seems like maybe that's my purpose! It is simply entitled... anonymous.  all the best poems are written by people who don't know who they are.
