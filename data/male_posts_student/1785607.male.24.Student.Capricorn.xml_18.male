We were in my car and we turned the radio on, they were playing Jewel's Standing Still...  I was a little down at the moment and it did hit hard... I was thinking of my previous relations and it just fit... So I said to Becky: "it must be a little too hard to live asking that, isn't it?" .... She said something so true, and yet it made me feel more sad than I was, she said: "in a relationship, there's always one that needs the most" ...   So who am I, the one who needs the most...?  Let's say, I've been thinking about this episode a lot since Thursday... and I've been down.. down.. down... so blue.. I just don't know why... yesterday I was all afternoon in my room, laying on bed, thinking, and thinking, and thinking... I cannot do my homework anymore... I just seem unable to concentrate...  Later at night I was on the net, msn with my very special friend, and at the beginning I was just giving him the cold shoulder and that's so not who I am... I kinda got in the mood more into the night.. but still... maybe is just that I am just a drama queen... now I see why I try not to get my emotional defenses down... I get sad so easily...  Now if u read this later, and I don't get the chance to talk to you in person about this, then here it goes:  I'm sorry if I seem pushy regarding the relationship stuff, I think now that two years in the single mode took its toll. Also, sorry if I seem so anal on the net, u are working and want to have a nice time... and I'm just too serious. I'll try to be more easy going... All this because I don't want to jeopardize something that could be SO good ... And as I once put it on my msn screen:    For of all sad words of tongue or pen,  the saddest are these, "It might have been!"    John Greenleaf Whittier    And believe you me.... Is not the first time this words would have haunted me... hope this time they won't...
