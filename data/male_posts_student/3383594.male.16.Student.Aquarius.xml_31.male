It's much betta than juz using the com or not doing anything at all. Although I still hafta admit tt I slack quite alot as well. Hehe, but it shld be 1 step at a time rite?  Well, in the evening, around 6:45pm, I met my pri sch fren. Haha, I've using the term "pri sch fren" for almost every single entry when I talk about him. Well firstly they're not diff ppl, it's juz the same person. Secondly, I'll refer to him as Lix frm now on. Yea, so Lix and I went to Pizza Hut to haf dinner, chill and simply relax. We stayed there for like an hour. The bill was like $33 and i dunnoe how many cents. We were basically talking about anything we could think of. Our main topic was Euro 2004. Haha, he predict tt France will emerge as the champs, but he wants Italy to win. As for me, I haf no idea who will win, but I hope tt Portugal does.  We went to West Mall after tt juz to look around. I saw this game on "Troy" which cost onli $9.90! Cheap Original Stuff! Haha, but in the end I didn't buy it although I dunnoe why. Haha, I think tt I'll probably buy it on another day when I get there. I was basically lookin for a Piggy Bank! Yea, u heard me rite! PIGGY BANK!!! Hehe, well I want it cus I want to keep excess money in it and probably use it on important stuffs. For example, b'dae presents, gambling, special ppl, clothes, games and so much more. Well, although there isn't much in there rite now, I hope to accumalate much more. It's like a rectangular shape container made of metal. It was a spider-man mechandise and it cost me $5.90. Pretty cheap rite? Haha, there's a lock and 2 keys too! Wow, I can't wait to save all my money in there! Hehe.  I reached home like 9:30pm and juz chill. I was chatting wif quite a number of ppl on MSN earlier on and watching Fear Factor. Haha, anyway after this entry I think I might writing another entry on "Choices Part II"! Doesn't tt sounds exciting? L0L! Alrite, I gotta go do tt rite now! Cya!!! =]
