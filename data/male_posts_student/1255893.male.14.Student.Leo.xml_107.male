I could keep goin on like this  but it'd be better if i gave you a lil background on why i feel like shit.   around 5 or so i got a call from ave askin if i could go to hometown buffet.  Of course i HAD to go since it would be my last chance to see her till december.  It was so kewl. I got to meet her friend's franny and divina... ( i hope i spelled that right ) . they were kewl, i had fun until the ride back home, thats when i realised ave was crying. i don't know how i held my tears in but i somehow did. when we got to my house we got out and i jus couldn't bring myself to let go of her. i think that's about when my waterworks turned on. as they all got back in the car I walked up to the front door of my apartment and stood there waving goodbye until i could no longer see the car. well, I got to thinkin after that and realised.......... its only 4 months. but then i told myself.... wait...... thats 24 weeks... 168days!!!!!!! so i basically made myself feel worse. Im gona miss you sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much!!! :'( i keep thinking im gonna see you at school...... then i remember im not goin back to 8th grade.. im movin forward.......... that sounds so final doesn't it? you do realise i have no point right?? LOL! jus remember that when ur down u can always call me. send me pics too cus i nno wanna miss a minute of u growin an movin on w/out me.  I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! buhbye FOR NOW!
