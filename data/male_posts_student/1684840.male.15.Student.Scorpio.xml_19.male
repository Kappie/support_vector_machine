We took off from Manchester Airport about 11:28AM and I got a window seat to take some great pics (I'll upload some tomorrow :D)  The attendants came around with drinks and pretzels and they showed "Chicago" on the projector.  The view outside the plane was phenomenal.  We were supposed to be flying straight over the Atlantic but we took the scenic route, across Greenland and Iceland and Canada, and then finally into America and finally to Atlanta.  Getting through Immigration was like watching paint evaporate.  Sheldon got straight through because he was an American Citizen, but we had to wait for about 50 minutes, making us miss our connecter flight to San Antonio.  We finally got through and we left our luggage with customs, made our way through the metal detectors and up to the departure lobbies.  We took a shuttle train to Lobby C only to find our plane had left, so they assigned us another.  We made our way to Lobby D and waited for our new flight to San Antonio on a smaller commercial plane (the US equivilant of the UK's train system lol, well, you couldn't say in the UK, "Hey I'm just gonna pop down Stoke on the plane" lol)  We had no in-flight movie this time because the flight duration was only about 2 hours.  We arrived at our final destination at San Antonio Airport which looked like a bomb had hit it (It was currently being refurbished).  We made our way to baggage where we had a horrible feeling that our luggage had gone astray..  :o  We found it in the end and a helpful airport man came to whisk our cases to the entrance where Sheldon's freind was waiting to pick us up.  We drove through San Antonio City, full of bright lights and littered with advertisments.  There were hundreds of fast food restraunts everywhere!!  We drove to a shopping place where we spotted a drive-thru pharmacy, yes you heard me right, a drive-thru pharmacy!  I've seen it all now lol  We waited in the car listening to Avril Lavine and then drove to Sheldon's house.  It's currently 10:39 CST, and I imagine about 4:39AM over in good old England :D  Keep posted for pics of the flight, they're awesome!!
