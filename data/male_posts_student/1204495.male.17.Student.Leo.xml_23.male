Then I can use it in my exam or something. Thank you dear. Here's the start for you...  Alone and forgotten beside the stairs of a disused library, the war memorial stands. A ghost of the past, the only object to remind us of the deaths of our proud men. They thought that they were fighting for the good of humanity, but no one visits anymore. They are all too busy living their own lives; lives which are only possible as a result of the brave actions of these men. But one, just one man still comes back here. He hasn’t forgotten, he feels at one with the statue. Old and lonely, yet strangely content. Sitting by the side of the statue, not moving, only thinking. Just as no one cares about the statue, no one cares about him. He's a skeleton of a man, a life gone wrong. An empty shell in a human form....    There you go dear, I'd be so grateful if you would finish it for me. Hey, it'll only take you a few hours. This is what I did in around 5 minutes. I'm sure you'll have as much fun as I did. =) For some strange reason I'm thinking that you wont do it..  P.S. It doesn't need to be interesting, it's just a nice place to keep your thoughts.  P.P.S. My picture does work. You're just jealous coz you can't do it. =P
