It's kind of like those pesky telemarketers. I recieved a spam email from somebody trying to sell me valium. So I sent a reply email to him saying: Dear Spam-face, I would like to thank you for offering the great deal on valium. Factory price sounds great, however, I have to decline. I would much rather have diazepam rectal gel, as it gives me a tingling feeling in my anal area. Though I may take you up on your offer next time I am on the phone with tech support.                                                                     With Love,                                                                            Christopher Wells   I then took the email address and went to as many sites as I could think of and signed him up for every newsletter I could find.
