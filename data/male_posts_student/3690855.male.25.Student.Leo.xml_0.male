I worked Friday and Saturday nights, thus eliminating any semblance of a weekend, although I did spend part of Saturday at Joe's watching the Mets/Yankees game (we must be good luck together, as they won.  Every game we go to at Shea together they also win.  Good things happen when me and Joe are together, I suppose).  Sunday I did nothing.  That I can blame solely on me choosing to be a lazy bastard.    Monday I went to the Phillies game with my friend Jeff.  It was my first trip to the new ballpark, but I still had the sense that I've been there before.  See, people criticised the multi-purpose stadiums like Riverfront Stadium, Veterans Stadium, and Three Rivers Stadium in the 70's.  "They're cookie-cutter stadiums," people would protest.  And they were right.  They were built so teams could play football and baseball in the same stadium, yet were enjoyable to neither group of fans.  Now the new thing is building the seperate stadiums.  Football stadiums seem to all be the same.  I don't think there is any difference between them whatsoever other than the name brand on the front of the stadium and the colour of the seats.  Possibly the cuisine too, depending on geography.  The baseball stadiums are a little better, but they still all have a similar formula.  Improved sightlines and "cozier" atmosphere - Check. Super huge scoreboard - Check.  Barbeque stand run by former major leaguer - Check.  Major restaurant chain in left field - Check.  Expanded clubhouse shop full of gimmicks for the team to sell - Check Some sort of "History of the Franchise" exhibit that the old stadium couldn't be bothered with - Check.  Camden Yards started this trend, so it gets props for originality.  And sure, most other fields have their own little quirks to them to make them different.  But really, there isn't a huge difference between the Cit, PNC, Camden Yards, etc.  Of course, those are the only three I've been to, so I'll just have to assume that the rest are like this.  If I'm wrong, feel free to leave feedback for me.  I have yet to receive one piece of feedback, so I have no evidence whatsoever that people are reading these.  So if you're reading this, and even if I'm right on my theory that all new stadiums are the same, just let me know somebody is reading this.  I am a pathetic soul, I am aware.  Anyway, what's on tap for this week?  Tomorrow is a "WCW" day.  That stands for West Coast Wednesday.  The name came because I used to go to my friend Jeff's house late at night for PS2 playing sessions, often arriving there at around 11 PM.  Because they started so late, around the time West Coast baseball games would start, the name "West Coast Wednesdays" was given to the events, whether they took place on Wednesdays or not.  Now, even the events that take place at 8 PM on a Thursday (as most of them have been) are called WCW.  I suppose another name could be given to them, but at this point, why bother?  Thursday is school and the radio show (www.wmcx.com, the link should work this week, last week we had web technical difficulties).  Friday I work.  Boo.  Saturday I'm going to Mets/Yankees at Shea Stadium.  If you're there, look for the fella wearing an authentic Ty Wigginton road grey jersey.  And Sunday is the 4th of July, where I will be spending at least part of the day at work.  Double boo.  At some point this week, perhaps Thursday during my seven hour break between class and my radio shift (you read that right, seven hours of time to kill) I'll probably check out the new Spider-Man movie.  Perhaps I'll even do a review here or on the radio.  And maybe something unexpected will come up.  I doubt it.  Anyway, that's today's update.  Hopefully better ones await.
