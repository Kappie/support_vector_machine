It seems that all those things I wanted to post on a blog, so that I won't forget them, have vanished from my head. What an irony; I start a blog so that I can recall the idea's which i get from time to time, and so that I can improve upon it, after sometime, with fresh inputs, but when I post on a blog, I don't even remember what I wanted to post. Very well, what I  have forgotten is now the past. Atleast I have started the blog. Now all I have to do is wait till those ideas comes back to me, or else till new ideas storm into my brains and make the grey cells twinkle and flash like the 4th of July (Which incedently I have seen only on the screen).
