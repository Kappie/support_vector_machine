I'd give it up for one more day I'd give it up so you could stay I'd give up everything so we could be together.  Sometimes I think your here beside me  Watching me write everything I never told you Yeah the days get longer and they colder But it wont wear down on me as long as I think of being with you.  I'd give it up for one more day I'd give it up so you could stay I'd give up everything so we could be together.  I'd give it up for one more day I'd give it up so we could be together I'd give up everything so you could stay Because I couldent take that as our final goodbye.
