Orton, Batista and Flair - and even the sledgehammer - tried to interfere but Goldberg turned the tables and beat them down with the sledgehammer until he decided he doesn't need it to eliminate Triple H. A spear and a jackhammer later, Goldberg was declared the winner, retaining his title.  In other matches, the show opened with Team Lesnar vs Team Angle. Within a few minutes three members were eliminated. Cena and Benoit ended up the survivors after Cena FU'ed the Big Show. Yes, that's right, Cena got Show in a fireman's carry and turned him over; Molly Holly kept her women's title by defeating Lita. Not a bad match, but usually the women perform better; The ambulance match was next with little wrestling and a lot of hard stuff. Shane hit his usual high spots, including a coast-to-coast off the top of the ambulance. Kane was on the receiving end of a sick shot to the head from the ambulance door with no protection. Kane tombstoned Shane on the concrete to finish him off; The Basham Brothers managed to keep their titles as well after Chavo hit his uncle with a shot to the head while doing a spinning DDT. Shaniqua received a frog splash form Eddie and some spanking from Chavito during the match; Team Austin vs Team Bischoff followed with HBK stealing the show sporting a crimson mask while doing his thing. HBK had the match won after Austin stunnered Orton but Batista interfered, did a tiger bomb on the former champ and Orton covered as the unconscious referee came to his senses. After the match Austin said goodbye in a cool TV moment. Oh yeah, he also beat down Coach's @ss; The final match before the main event saw Undertaker losing the Buried Alive match vs Vince McMahon. McMahon bled from the first 5 seconds of the match and lost tons of blood. Just sick sick sick. McMahon got pounded during the match until it was time to get buried, when Kane came out from the truck after an explosion. Kane then beat on 'Taker and McMahon dumped the dirt in the grave site to get the win.
