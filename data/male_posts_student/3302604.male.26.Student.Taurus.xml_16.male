In fact, the only reason I'm here now is that I've been asked to talk to some inspectors about the maths department so I can tell them what I think. After that, the only thing to do is hope that the notes I got through the term are good enough (as you don't expect me to have read any of them yet) and revise like mad.  So, it appears from some government research that one in twenty kids have ADHD, or attention deficit disorder. Now, call me cynical if you like, but in recent years the number of kids diagnosed with this has gone up quite remakably. Now, some may argue that this is because more is understood about the condition by experts and they can treat it better, but it seems to me that at least part of it is that the condition is more understood by  parents  and so they can use it as an excuse not to be able to control their kids. Anyhow, it doesn't really bode well for having 1-2 kids like that in every class you teach. Aargh.  Went out to see the new  urlLink Harry Potter film  yeaterday. Cue groans here. But, evenb though the three main kids are considered slightly annoying (but looking at it dispassionately you can see they are good young actors) the thing that I certainly didn't appreciate is that the rest of the cast are made up of the finest British actors there are, and so each and every one puts in a fantastic performance, making it an exceptional film. I'll probably even go to see the next one.  Also yesterday I bought a few DVDs. I got the  urlLink  Open Range  and Bad Taste. The first is a good story that I saw earlier this year at the cinema. Kevin Costner was born to do westerns and since I'm a bit of a western freak, I loved it. The other is the funniest and grossest film I've ever seen. Words can't describe it. Really. If you haven't seen it yuo haven't lived.  Jack
