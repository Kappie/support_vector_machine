Haha.. that is IF none of my friends were there. Yeah.. I did manage to go to the library alright, did some of my work.. BUT I just can seem to get all the points out of my head and put it into words that I'm supposed to write.. gosh.. In NeeD OF ENgLIsh TuItIon man! LoL.. at least still, I got some of my stuff done ;) tonnes more waiting for me to accomplish.. gosh.. speaking about studies! Ugh.. my physics teacher by the way sucked totally in teaching! I couldn't keep my eyelids up during his lessons.. argH! early revision proved to work for me though... FOR NOW! Anyways.. at least today I still had some of my work done.. ;)  I really need to get this out of my fucking soul..! OMG..! Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban, GOSh..believe it or not.. the much anticipated sequel SUCKED! ya heard me! spelled S.U.C.K.E.D..! they din show the full quidditch match.. some scenes were cut out from the book..! and the movie's just about merely 2 hours compared to the last 2 prequels which is obviously more than that..! There's nothing we can do but to blame that bloody director, Alfonso Cuaront.. Obvioulsy we can't blame the actors rite? They all just look too damn good..! Shrek 2's my next target on the big screen..I just can't stand people talking about Shrek 2 knowing that I haven't watched it.. hmmph.. aRGh! just can't stand the constant naggings behind.. need to get ready for bed or else I'm toasted.. literally! Signing Off~!
