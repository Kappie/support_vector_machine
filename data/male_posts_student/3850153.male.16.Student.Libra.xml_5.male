"I think a large percentage of the general population will agree that there is a definite void of Christopher Reade on the net right now" Reade said today from his home in Huntington Woods. Reade hopes he can keep up with the large volume of things Christopher Reade is involved with on a daily basis: "Christopher Reade is no lazy man. Far from it"
