I give you this promise The promise to try, I give you each breath And the tears I cry.  I give you my past My future and now, I give you my thoughts My hope and this vow. To give you my voice, And the music I sing, I give you forever, I give you this ring.  I give you my world, All the pain and strife, I give you my hand Learn to share my life. I give you this kiss And these words I say, "I'll cherish you always As of this day."  I give you my faith That these words are true, For today, I swear, To spend my life with you.           isn't this poem nice? someone who is declaring his/her love for someone, this poem makes me remind of someone who was there for me most of da tym...  anyway, da past few days were all soccer stuff... due to da euro 2004, i haf been slping late  lyk 6 in da morning, u all can see me as, Marcus aka Panda liao le, hahaz  France Rocks, Sweden too... hahaz i gonna die already, cus doctors say tat if a person who doesn't get enough slp, why burst a few blood vessals...  hahas, i tink not only me will die those singaporean soccer fans will die too, hehehe, evil ar me only Alex, da cat hehehe, will understand how it feels to not haf ur beauty rest hahaha...  i am gonna go to gym to go workouts, after tat i gonna go swimming 36 laps, hahas tml u all will see on da newspaper,  SOCCER FAN, ONLY 15 DIED IN DA POOL, FILLED WIF BLOOD AFTER BURST OF BLOOD VESSALS... hahahaha, ok la... i go slp liao le or not realli gonna mati !!!
