Oh well, at least her parents are finally loosening up about us being together.   The park was huge, biggest I've ever been to.  The lines werent all that bad, but everything down there we really expensive.   The weather did manage to stay nice until about 10:00pm yesterday night, then it started pouring, but we were ready to leave by then anyway.  I also just went and saw 'Without a Paddle'  It was pretty sweet, I couldnt get ahold of Kari to ask if she could go, but her parents probly wanted a chance to see her themselves anyway.  Maybe She'll be able to do something again before school starts up.
