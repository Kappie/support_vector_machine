First musician you remember hearing in your house: Ok, this is debatable in my memory.  Sonja listened to a lot of music.  She often played NIN's Downward Spiral album,  They Might Be Giants Flood album, REM, and some other bands (I even starred in a music video she made in High school,  with U2's  End of the World song, and me eating a pizza slice and dancing).  For a fact, I know that the first music video I ever saw was  Megadeth's 99 Ways to Die, on MTV, talking about gun violence and all the kids with guns.  So I guess Nine Inch Nails?  I really don't know.
