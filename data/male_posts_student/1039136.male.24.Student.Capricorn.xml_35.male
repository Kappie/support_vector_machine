In the email, she apologized for alot..she sent me the lyrics to a song which applied to her side of the situation. It meant alot to me because its always nice to get an apology and ontop of that its REALLY nice to feel appreciated for once.  I do or have done so much for so many people in the past, but have receieved little appreciation at all. At times in the past i've been a sap..i was too nice. I've corrected the problem though...i dont spend to much time mending anyone elses life anymore..hell i've become pretty self centered. I just want to make myself happy anymore. Sometimes that means I have to do things that arent "right" or things that may hurt other people..and so fuckin what, right? I mean..it's my life, i'm not here to make everyone else happy. I'm here for me, and like Ice T said...there's no way in hell youre going to be able to make everyone happy. So i make me happy. And i am happy. I have some really good friends that i consider blood.  I'm in good health, I have fun. Maybe if i were rich..that would help..but hey..money isnt everything to me. I know i'm rambling..i dont care I lost my Ecard and had to blow 15 bucks on another one. I'm such a dumbass sometimes.  I had what i would call a pretty shitty day yesterday but it ended up being good after i got some work done and talked to some key people...who totally turned my day/night around.  aside from those parts of my life...  WRESTLING MAY 2nd SEE ME FOR TICKETS THIS COMING WEEK and..visit  urlLink The Teen Icon Zone  and  urlLink WBzoo.com  for more info.  GO..or dont ever talk to me again!  Peace
