Ya, so, I told Keli yesterday that I would talk to her today no matter what, even if I had to drive out to her house, and so that's exactly what I did, I drove out to her house just to say Hi, and if anything else happened, well, that would been kool too, but it was actually just for the purpose of saying Hi.   I wish I wasn't such a nervous bastard*sorry, bastard seems to be my word of the night..I'm saying it about everything.  Either way, I, whenever I'm around girls*especially girls that I like* become a nervous wreck, and am barely able to do anything....seriosuly anything.  Like at the movie, I was too nervous to go and get a frickin' pop, and i have no klue why, why can't I have higher self-esteem...DAMN YOU SOCIETY!!!!!  Either way, it's 12:30 in the morning..and I'm sleepy as hell...seriosuly..I don't kow why I'm this sleepy...I need to sleep, bad..and so does Steve.....wow...I just started talking with an irish accent, and I'm scottish...what the hell is wrong with me right now?!@?!??!?!?1  I want to sleep...and so does Steve, because he's ranting about how he wants his interview, because I said I would interview him about his time getting hit by a helicopter...in the PS2 game Downhill Domination..it was funny..this helicopter seriosuly just popped out of a solid rock wall, and hit Steve.....god that was funny..he doesn't get a damn interview, I'm too sleepy.  Instead, I'm gonna go to sleep and dream about Keli, god she rox... Sweet Dreams and Peacec Out!  Spense
