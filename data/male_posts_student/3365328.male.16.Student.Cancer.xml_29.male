After about a minute of non-moving bus, I realised there was a problem. One of the women had given the bus driver half a 'saver' ticket, (which suggests a used ticket - the driver rips off one half, usually) which had been refused. She then got into an argument and started swearing alot at the driver, who promptly started radioing the next driver to tell him not to let on the offenders. Listening to the irate conversation, I heard one of the women say such witty retorts as: 'How old are you, ninety-twelve?'...  And they say people aren't as good at maths as they used to be...
