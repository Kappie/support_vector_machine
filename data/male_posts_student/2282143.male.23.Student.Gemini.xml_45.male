Pain just shoots all over my body.  Is this normal or at least temporary?  I felt a bump on my right forearm.  No idea what the hell that is... yargh.  I joke with my mom and tell her its cancer.  I know Im only kidding around, but it kinda sits in the back of my mind.   what if?  I guess that death is just part of the way of things, but there is still so much more to experience in this life.  I think that is why I sometimes wonder what TJ would be doing now.  He would have graduated this winter and I could imagine that probably now we would be doing weekends down in St. Louis or hanging out down town Chicago.  Just hanging out.  Laughing.  Talking about how the Sox and the Cards are going to the World Series this year, grumbling how much Duke sucks for beating us and how much it sucks that we shot ourselves in the foot in that game, playing darts, shooting pool, and thinking of mean things we could do to Pop once he passes out.  Sometimes, I just wonder...  Life just isnt fair...  So that just makes me want to enjoy every moment Im here.  Frank Zappa was a very wise man.  Unfortunately, he too was taken away from us too early from cancer.  But he said that "We're all just bozos on this bus" and you never know when your stop will be...  Anyways, enough depressing myself.  I felt best when I was running around tonight.  For some reason, my knees were feeling ok, I was very weak, but very loose.  Oh well.  Maybe some sleep will help.
