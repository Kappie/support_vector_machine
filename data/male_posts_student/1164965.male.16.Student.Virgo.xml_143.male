Personal relationships are what have the most influence on peoples' lives, no matter how much pop-culture goes into an assembly.  So this weekend be safe, sober if possible, but if you do choose to drink, remember to have a plan, and that drunk-driving is NEVER the best alternative, or acceptable at all.  Once again, great job AVA, have fun but be safe!  Love, Rob  OH, by the way, Thomas mentioned some independent reading?  Could anyone fill me in on what that will entail?  And while I'm having after-thoughts, good luck to everyone that's taking their AP History tests tomorrow.  Happy Review!
