Except for the fact that there really isn't much to do unless you want to go outside and freeze your arms off. Well according to weather.com, it is 5° out but feels like -13°. That's just great. I can imagine if we had school today all the kids that have to wait for a bus. Half would be frozen to the ground and the other half would have pneumonia. (I killed the spelling on that) But now I find myself asking why am I up at 10 on a Friday when we have no school? Oh well. Chicken boullions are disgusting by the way. Who would take one and eat it plain? That's just wrong. Why do all these blog posts take me 30 minutes to write? Maybe because I start writing, lose my concentration, go watch TV, go play the guitar, come back, write another sentence, repeat whole process.. I should become a writer. It would only take me the next five years to complete one chapter, but hey. Everyone likes a challenge.  Listen to H.I.M.
