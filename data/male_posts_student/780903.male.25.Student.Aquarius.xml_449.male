So it's opt-out, not opt-in for the bundles).  After carefully scrutinizing the lottery details they provided -- schedule timeslot blocks, maximum and minimum credits per semester and per year, limit of one seminar during pre-registration, 3L priority bumping, lists of traditionally oversubscribed courses -- I ranked my top 24 choices (just couldn't come up with a final 7), and ended up, happily, getting pretty much everything I wanted.  I'm 38th on the "priority wait list" for a seminar on Literature and the Law that I ranked first -- rising 3Ls get two full rounds before us, so it must have filled up then.  In fact, I talked to a rising 3L who ranked it first and didn't get it, so it filled up real fast -- but it's a class of 15, so the chances of 38 people adding and then dropping it is pretty slim.  Other than that, I got the classes I wanted: Bankruptcy (fall) and Secure Transactions (winter -- a 3-week mini-term where you take one class, for three hours every day), both with the awesome professor I had for contracts in the fall, Local Government Law (fall), a seminar on Behavioral Law and Economics (fall), and a class on Jewish law (spring).  My one-liner on that is that I'm taking it to meet a nice Jewish girl.  You think I'm kidding?  :)  Also yesterday: the Office of Career Services' Fall On-Campus Interviewing kickoff meeting, letting us know what we'll have to do over the summer to get ready for on-campus interviewing in September.  I think I've got 800 words in me to talk about that, so I'll save it for tomorrow.
