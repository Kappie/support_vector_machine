Why do we all have different favorite colors, colors that stand out to us more than another color. I think color, a favorite color, says allot about someone. How they think, what they enjoy, or don't enjoy. My favorite color would be red, followed by orange and then green. I say this for several reasons. Red is a color that stands out, it is a contrast to the surrounding world. It contrasts inself to the green grass, blue sky, and yellow sun. Orange has the same qualities as red, standing out. But the one element that can claim orange as it's color is the setting sun. I love the setting sun, because it's beautiful, but also because it's a sign that even though life is closing in one part of the world, it's just beginning in another. And I like green for an entirely different reason. Because green blends into the earth. It's so mellow, not jumping out at anyone, yet what would the world look like without grass or the green on the trees? It wouldn't be the same. In order for one color to stand out, another must blend in. As christians, we stand out because Jesus blended in for us on this earth; an earth full of hate, lies and deception. He chose to come as a child, blending in, bringing the news. We are to send out the news and contrast the world we live in. He was the green so we could be the orange and red.
