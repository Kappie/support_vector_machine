I keep trying to convince myself that it's for the best but everytime I do, tears come out of nowhere. Right now, it feels like 10 family members have died. And there's nothing I can do about it. And there's nothing I can do without her. But I do know we are going to be good friends. She told me she wants that. And I want it too. I think I need her company just to remain slightly sane. She also told me there is a chance for us in the future. That really does give me a bit of hope. Anyway...  I just went to my half-sisters uncles aquarium (how confusing?!). It's cool there. I decided to rebuild my own fish tank, so I cleaned a massive bag of gravel this morning. It took so long. I'm gonna set it all up properly tomorrow. I'm too tired right now and I have way too much on my mind.
