There is no restriction on what one can post, but one must have the some considerations in mind as all the post will be open for general viewing.  I am trying to creat a chronoligcal list of blogs(about events and life at IIFM) so that our juniors,or any one can see that.  For more info and getting the user id mail me at    urlLink san1378@yahoo.com
