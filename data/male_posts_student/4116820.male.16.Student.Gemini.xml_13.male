Yes, thats right another shitty shark movie. More money wasted so people can have their false fears about sharks exploited. Sharks almost never attack humans, and even then it's because you smell like blood or look like a seal, and hey if you look like a seal we don't mind because you're ugly. On another note John Kerry, sissy Democrat (What would possess someone to be a democrat?)still sucks. Vote independent or write yourself in for president.
