It just sounds like the perfect game, a game I can get into easily and that'll keep me interested for months and months. I can't wait.  Thoughts about universities and the future have also been floating around in my head as well. Sheffield and Nottingham have become hot favourites over Reading, although I can't really make much of a decision until I go and see them in person. I've also been thinking about some really simple things like Thunderbolt's postal address and so on. Little things that I don't really need to worry about right now.  My driving's coming on okay, I just need to get some more practice in and book my theory test. I'm just worried that I'll have to get like 30 lessons and it'll cost a bomb. It's already enough with the insurance (don't even ask about it!).  At the moment, I feel like I've got too many things to think about, like I need more time. But I don't really, I'm just confusing myself trying to do everything at once. Not good, and I'm going to try and rectify that soon.
