GOD PEOPLE YOU WOKE ME UP! ITS ONLY 11:43AM. if i find you people im going to kill every child you ever have so i can take away every ounce of happiness a person deserves. let this be a warning.  with that said. i got an awesome bad religon poster from lis last night and a whole bunch of stickers, i have no clue where im going to put them all, but they, i will find a place. i just got the strangest urge to make corn and i dont know why. but yeah, im out. i may post later i may not. be happy with what you got haha.   i want to see how many people read this, so if you stop by then please post. thanks, adam
