Theres a force, humans have... and theres a force of earth. one can manipulate the other, and vice versa... humans have willed that there is a god, karma, and hell, so you will be affected by these.... its prolly about 60/40 in your favor as to what you will believe though... that perfectly axplains all the "Miricles" performed by jesus... and all the other things that we call "magick", so long as you believe, its possible.....
