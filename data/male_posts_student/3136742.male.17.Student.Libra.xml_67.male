As I've learned to hone my musical skills I've picked up some rules-- rules that musicians should follow to ensure their musicianship is at its highest quality: -If the line you are going to play can't be hummed by a listener, or get stuck in someone's head, it isn't worth playing. It is forced and insincere. -There's more than one way to say what you want, but there is always one BEST way. -Be concise. Only play/be concerned with what is necessary. Intricacies are meaningless and only impress the na√Æve. Dmdim^6sus9 does not matter. It is simply Dm. -Just as a bike, a bus, and a car are all different means of getting to a single destination, technique is just a means of saying what you want to say. It should not dictate the music that you play... You drive your car, the car does not drive you where it wants to go. You control your music, do not let the rules of your music control you. -There is no breaking tradition, there is only evolution. There was a point when tradition wasn't tradition. There are people who want to keep it bebop, but at one point bebop wasn't tradition. People like Dizz and Bird were really streatching it. -People ask "How can I learn to improvise [better]?"-- They don't realize that they most likely improvised that question. They werent thinking nouns, pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, etc. You say what you feel, but it's because your vocabulary is big enough that you have a lot to choose from, and you can actually make sense with what you say. Improv is about building a musical vocabulary so large, so well, that you con't have to think about what you're trying to say, you just say it. When you do think about it it's like walking; when you think about walking you trip. (I could go on and on with this)  Music is a language, as any other language. From being a musician, from following these rules, I am able to find my voice. I take this same approach to my other native language, English. When I write (and talk, in most cases) I try to use English the way I use music. I try to be musical. The most important thing is sincerity-- Am I saying what I truly feel? Am I saying what I truly mean?-- Without sincerity all other skill, all other conventions are useless. Speak from your heart and hit them in their soul. With music you can't just go back and unplay what you just played, nor should you if you could. It's about the moment, as cheesy as that sounds. It's about how you feel and what made you feel that way, right in the context of then and there. That is why 90% of all my first drafts end up being my final copies. I may go back and change words but I still try to keep the exact feeling I was shooting for in the first place. There is a place for eloquence and there is a place for absurdity. For instance: A jazz concert is no place for the sazophonist to get up and take a stand-up comedy solo. However, there are instances where what you say or write can and should be [terribly] out of place. Doing this can work to accentuate or reinforce what you are trying to say. It's like how many heavy metal bands incorporate acoustic guitars, and even orchestras, into their music. It makes for a more profound effect. Finally, and most importantly (to my style) is my use of grammar and punctuation. Almost always, I will say something a certain way (ie use a specific word, or use a certain conjunction) because I mean to do exactly that. You'll find lots of alliteration, repetition, and odd/unconventional comma use (among other punctuations) in my writing, and it's usually there because that's exactly how I want it. It makes things sound rhythmic and adds a tasteful melody. But, I never intend to sound lyrical, only musical-- melodic, rhythmic. I picked this up from jazz pianist/composer Dave Brubeck, who used words, names, and lines of speech to write melodies for his instrumental songs. Just like in music, every word has a timbre (colot), but that color can depend greatly on the words/notes preceeding it and following it. Each word has its own feel-- a staccato, a crescendo, a cascade-- it's all a matter of finding the right one for what you have to say and how you want your readers to feel.
