Then my mom picked me up at 12:45 then i went to Dr.Darling.  He did X-rays and moldings and stuff.  I ran into Robert Aron at the orthodontist.  Then i came home and went over to Jaime and Jakes.  Came home then went to go get Spiderman 2 (the titest game ever.)  Been playing it forever and been talking to toniann jessicka and sum other peeps online. Im suppose to go eat lunch with Kimmy,Toniann,and Jessika tomorrow after Jcc since they all go there.   Peace out,     chrisb
