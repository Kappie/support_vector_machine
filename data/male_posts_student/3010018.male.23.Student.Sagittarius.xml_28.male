Yea i changed the site again.. not because i didnt like the way it was before but just because i wanted to see what it looked like if it was like this...i like it this way....seems more elegant...if that means anything...  the director of the CIA George Tenet resigned his position a day or two ago for personal reasons....now this is not all that surprising or newsworthy but yesterday James Pavitt the deputy director of the CIA resigned and a CNN.com article(  http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/06/04/tenet.resigns/index.html  ) states that Pavitt planned to resign a month ago...which of course is very convienent for the CIA and of course the political agendas of these two men...I am wondering, what happened at Langley, Virginia or in DC that is so horrible that the two men who run the Central Intelligence Agency have suddenly resigned within 24 hours of one another ? It strikes me as odd that these two men would resign in such close proximity...it makes me think that something really bad as happend or is about to happen and they are getting out before the crap storm hits......they want to get out before anyone can lay blame on them for the failures in intelligence gathering prior to 9-11 and the poor intelligence used to justify the war in Iraq....of course some one must be responsible.....maybe these two guys were going to be the scape goats....I dont know what really happened or why they resigned, i doubt we will ever know the truth but realize that this is no coincidence, this is th e result of a catastrophic shake up in the political roster of Washington DC that will claim more people's jobs and hopefully bring in a new President.
