Wandered around the City Hall area after my paper, went to check a few things out, windows shop for a bit...pretty boring...  Was kinda looking for something fun to do...I mean it's just after exams so it's only natural, but on top of that I only have a small window of time for R before I jump back into the fray with that project due early May. Kind of worried about it. I barely have two weeks to do it and yet it counts for like 90% of my marks for that module. Worse of all I have no idea how to start it. Looks like I have to contact my lecture and throw him some questions.     >   Once I get through that however, it should be an eventful month. Lots of new stuff coming out and I intend to start a new hobby.     >   Got a call from an old friend, RthCk , just before the exams. Haven't heard or seen her in a long time...more than a year I believe. Hope to squeeze in some time to meet up before she leaves on a business trip in May. I tell you that girl is always busy. Another old friend I need to meet up with is  SLyn , very fun to talk to her and get all nostalgic about our primary school days.    >   Well time to update the links and layout...
