This pretty much sums it up: Readings by computers (391 titles)  Its hard to imagine Microsoft Sam doing justice to a novel. Maybe a Franz Kafka book would do well read by a computer, but I'd be hard pressed to imagine anything else sounding remotely decent.  It  is  free though, so I shouldn't criticize. I read somewhere that around 400 books (text, not audio) are added each month, and that they have more than 10,000 books.  Maeve what happened to your site?
