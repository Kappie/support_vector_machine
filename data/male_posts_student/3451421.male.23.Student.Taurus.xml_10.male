The purpose oof the e-zine will to be to discuss King’s works and how they affected us. 13.	I would like all Stephen King fans to read this zine, as well as fans of literature in general. 14.	I would like to cover most, if not all aspects of his writing, fiction, non-fictionand his writng done under psuedoname. 15.	I hope to encourage people to read more King if they haven’t already. 16.	I would publish about once a month in order to keep changing the artiucles. Also, I would publish a specail article if King came out with a new book.
