In 1995 almost PHP 2 million were given to the Aetas in Capas by the United Nations for livelihood development.  Unfortunately the money went to only a few government and tribal officials with a majority of the Aetas not seeing a single centavo due to mismanagement by government officials and Aeta tribal leaders.    M.O.A. went off without a hitch. Leadership classes are scheduled for later this month to go over responsibilities of loan agreement.    Guerilla activity in the location I'm going to. There are several factions of the NPA. The most active being the New People's Army and the the break off faction the Prolitariat Revolutionary Army.    The older and more stable is the NPA and in the process of winning 'hearts and minds' in that instead of robbing people, they ask for donations, ie. revolutionary taxes. The PRA is rumored to be funded by the government and that they extort money from the local population. Because of their mixed ideologies it's not uncommon for both groups to clash.    A few months ago about 100 NPA were in the Aeta village we're travelling to. For the most part the encounter was peaceful (the NPA were in the village looking for potable water). The tribal chief requested that the NPA leave which they did.    The military came looking for them 2-days later. 20 people died along with 5 civilians.    Also in the area are bandit groups that extort money from the local barangays. The military was dispatched and drove the bandits away but were unable to catch any of the bandits.
