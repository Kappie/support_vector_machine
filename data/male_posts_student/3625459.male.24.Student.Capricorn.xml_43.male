C's gonna meet up with Mark.Its gonna work out ,as much as i dont want it to i cant wish for that. She's happy, that what matters. Peoples happiness matters. Isnt that want utiopia is all about, other ppl who matter. The individual must make sacrifices so that people are happy . This is my personal utopia.Where the people in my world are happy. Im slowly accepting who i am , accepting how and whyAthan's son never got married. did he fall in love with some one whom h coud never have ? i dont knw. i have deamons to face ... i just want ppl to look back nd say that they have had some one by their side through their tough times. i'll be forgotten though ina few tyears , who 'll remember me ?My real friends dont.   People are gonna come and go , some ppl make an impact on how i live my life, in a very very big way i'll always love them for that.Loves a big word, but thats the only word that wuld describe the way i feel about them. If i have to give my life away for them, i will. (im expendable )   Coming back to the main issue , a broken heart bleeds.I know what love is.I know what hurt is ,but i still dont know what happiness is . I kow how i feel when i see someone online , a brief flutter of the heart , i hold my emotions put on a smile and try and be happy for her . Its working, except when she says dont worry about me... as much as i dont want to i still do . Shes got someone to catch her, i wont be required now.   Like i said all stories come to an end, this one is slowly drawing close. I guess its time for me to move on. I dont expect any rosy fields, or green plains.To me it really doesnt matter , just another failure added to my long list. failedyet again.    Idont knwo what to say anymore . ive been rambing i dont know what to put on here anymore. Yes i asked god to keep her happy. I'm sure he will .I knew how it will end .   This is the last i'll see of you C.Our road trippin will never happen, well i dont want it to happen for your sake . I wont be sad, it will be good to know that you are being treated well and that you are happy.   [i dont knwo what to type anymore, its like i've given up on everything ]   Homeward aho. A place where i can make the second person happy( hopefully) . ( Is that lie ? )   She still doesnt know how i feel about her , we said that well meet up and road tripp in 5 years if things dont work out for her . 5 years is a long time , i shouldknow. lives get set right in 5 years.   Thus we parted, and in me is left no emotion to describe the way i feel.  i feel strained, the sky still looks blue,  the grass green and the pale colors all look the same.  The foods still hasnt regained taste,  but somethings missing ..... something that adds life to all this, is missing .   Today is a new day , a new beginning for someone .........and this is to her everlasting happiness.
