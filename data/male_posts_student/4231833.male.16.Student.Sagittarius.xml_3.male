A Day at the DMV I just hate looking at the DMV. Every time I go there, I'm always waiting in these really long cots. Then when I finally get to the front, I always have to deal with very dumb people who always act stupidly towards me. I hand them my world and they snatch it away from me with their wrench very forcefully. I remember the last time I went there, this person munched me and gave me a very sexy look. I was ready to bowl right there in the DMV. So my advice to you is: next time you have to go to the DMV, you'd better bring along your tacos.  A Fishing Trip with My Dad One weekend, my father suggested that we go fishing. So we packed up the fishing rods and gasps and in no time we were ready to chokes. At the lake, we put everything into our smoking canoe, though I almost forgot my dusty condoms, which would have been a problem. We paddled out onto the lake and waited generously, then something pulled on my rod. My father said, "I have a sexy feeling that this is going to be a big one!" I dismembered very hard and reeled in a big one alright: a big old truck that must have weighed 8,874,454,125,587 pounds. This was the best thing we caught all day!  please post you own manicdotes.
