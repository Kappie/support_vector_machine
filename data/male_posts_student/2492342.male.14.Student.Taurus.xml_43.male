I went to mcdonalds to get a coke(only, the food there SUCKS) and this chinese girl walks up behind me and starts humping me a few times. i give the money and then turn around, and she giggles. Then I couldnt find the coke machine, so i looked like a loner dork. Oh well!!  my dad and i are so weird.
