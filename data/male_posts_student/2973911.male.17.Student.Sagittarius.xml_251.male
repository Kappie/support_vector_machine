After a front page, what? Oo nga pala, dahil sa sem break kami rito at wala akong magawa sa buhay ko, I'm gonna make a lot of changes in  urlLink Midnght Delusions . I've already started with changing the pics in  urlLink About M3k    To the previous topic, no, it wasn't you, mon ami. It was the guy I told you I thought I was falling in love with. Remember him? The one we've used elven language to talk about? Or maybe I was simply the one who used the elven language. Regardless, it was him and now, I feel that I have done myself a great wrong. Whatever. It boggles my mind. I think. If my mind is still working, that is. I'll simply think about it, first.  On another point, I don't think love can be defined. It's way too broad a word. It's a noun and a verb and sometimes, a different part of speech altogether. I'd like to think that I do feel love in its different forms. I love immaterial and material things. I love to eat, for one. I love to dance. I love my collection of whatnots. I love people too. I love my mother and my father and a whole lot of others who have wormed themselves into my heart. Have I ever told you that I love you? Well, consider it said. Not that I love you in the romantic sense but I'd like to think that I care too much for you as a person to simply call it caring. Nevertheless, don't be alarmed by it as people seem wont to be, myself included. Just consider it caring in a deeper sense.   As for the phrase "falling in love." I don't think it's falling at all. To take the words of the character in "How to Deal," Why do people call it falling? Why don't they simply call it crashing because it is what it is. Considering the fact that I suck at exact quotes, that is not exactly what's been said but it is close or at least the meaning behind it is the same.   Yes, I foung the word, "yuck."  yuck   interjection  (also  yuk ) ( slang ) an expression of extreme dislike, disgust, etc. The Oxford Paperback Dictionary
