Jerry lauds the truck stop just past the Pennsylvania border, and that made us another hour late.  Megan forgot her purse; that's another thirty minutes.  Jeff is not in the room right now so I'll just say he's been really mean to me.  He won't let me touch the radio!  Anyway, pics tomorrow when we meet up with Ed, who for some reason needed silverware at 3 in the A.M.
