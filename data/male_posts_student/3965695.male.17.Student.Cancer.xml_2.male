Along the same lines, I can now see R rated movies without a parent. Woo hoo. Yeah for being 17.       Another random thought. As of right now I wear boxers, but I am considerating the switch to boxer briefs, allowing more support without being too constricting. I am afraid that I would miss the freedom of boxers, though. Perhaps a blend of both would suffice.       Also, a little story about today. I woke up around 330 in the afternoon because of my tiredness from the trip, and learned that I would be helping some old folks get rid of their vinal records at 415. So I go up to their door (I have already helped them out before) and some random old lady appears and I, being polite, had their newspaper in my hand. She grabs the paper, and without a word begins closing the door. So I explain that I thought that I was supposed to be getting some records, and she yells down to Mrs. McComis that I was here, and finally let me into the house. I am still not sure who she was, but I then spent 45 minutes putting a heck of a lot of records into boxes and carrying them out to my car. I didnt know those things were that heavy, but I guess carrying about 300 at a time will do that. So my little car is full and riding about an inch lower, and I need to take them and some other stuff to Salvation Army sometime tomorrow.  That was an interesting experience, and its kinda sad because the McComises have lived their their entire married life (they are early 70s) and now have to pack up everything they have accumulated over 50 odd years and move into a retirement community.    It is a little early in my life to say this, but I really dont think I want to be preserved by medicine when I am getting up there in years. It seems more than a little useless to me to have my kids paying for my health care when it only prolongs my life ( which by that stage is poor in quality) by a couple months, not to mention the massive costs of medication for old folks, and the strong probability that medicare will expire when my generation needs it. I understand that kids want their parents to live for a long time, etc, but look at something like Ronald Reagan. The guy was decimated by Alzheimers for a decade before he died. He didn't truely live for over ten years. I really do not want to live like that. So  go live your life to the fullest, cause you only got a few years. Don't waste it sitting around watching tv or doing something that you don't enjoy        "Well, I don't really think that the end can be assessed as of itself as being the end because what does the end feel like? It's like saying when you try to extrapolate the end of the universe, you say, if the universe is indeed infinite, then how - what does that mean? How far is all the way, and then if it stops, what's stopping it, and what's behind what's stopping it? So, what's the end, you know, is my question to you.
