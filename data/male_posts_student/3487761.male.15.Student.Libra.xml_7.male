Is it to be gaining knowledge or is ut to finding jobs or even to please our own parents?  What is civilisation? It is actually settling down of human but it appears it is false in present decades.  What high technology? It is sophsicated knowledge develop by us to serve ourselves, however it is suffocating our motherly planet.  What is of war? It is to be fought by the heroes to protect justice, on the other hand, it is started by the greed and selfishness of the apes. Some huge wars are fought to end all war, but it didn't take much longer for a human heart to fall into path of greed once more. So another misery surfaced to the world again.  A pathetic world indeed......
