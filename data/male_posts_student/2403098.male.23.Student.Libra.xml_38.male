Thankfully, the problem is easily (through effort) solved.  For a split second (and by split second I mean throwing up last night until 6am because I was so anxious) I thought I wasn't going to graduate!  HAHAHAHA.. whew.  Glad that's not the case.  Now it's time for a little siesta.  Then it will be time to start the living hell that will be the next two months of my life.  Pure, living, academic hell.  Care to join me in my white-hot-tormented end of the semester?  I'll save you a seat.
