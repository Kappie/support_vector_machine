I mean, come on, corporate America is trying to americanize Asia." True. But also: 1. This guy was a dumbass, you had to be there 2. America IS corporate, sure there's bad people in high places, but the root of America lies in the fact that people work for themselves, therefore forming businesses. Some would call this capitalism. Hence, a corporate America. 3. Asians don't have to go to McDonalds. The communists aren't shoving French (oh, freedom, sorry) Fries down their throats. 4. This guy thought he was cool cause he was hanging around Eastman/Java's. Hope he gets hit up by a beggar. That's what he wants, no corporate America, just lots of people begging for stuff. No corporate America, but he definately wants money to be cool and hang around Java's.  rrrr.
