I'm not going to get into what I wrote though, I guess it's just between Safari and me.  Lately I've been looking for an Apartment in Ottawa, it isn't easy- but it isn't that hard either.  I have my little eyes set on one place- it seems decent and isn't all that far from school. Next thing on the agenda is to get a laptop for school... it's expensive, but things are working out.  So now I just sit and wait (and try and save money) and study.  There just is not enough time in a day to accomplish everything I want to do.  So cheers to July!
