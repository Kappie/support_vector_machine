What I want and what I fear- Joan Didion    Song of the Moment :  Sailing  (yes the one by Rod Stewart, but performed by the London Symphony Orchestra)   Movie of the Day : With Honours (This is one of a few movies which I truly like)  Rambles: Ha, I did a lot of insight today; listening to Santana does that to me for some odd reason. I’ve been a fucking jerk for the better part of my life, and by better part I’m not talking about a majority of years, I’m talking about my life in the past three years or so. Before those years, I was a sorry sap of a person, and hell, I maybe still am, even if I don’t feel it.   I won’t go into my history, that is a bore which no man should rightly endure, or woman for that matter. People believe you should keep the past at hand, this only works in some cases.   FOR EXAMPLE, do we keep pictures of things we want to forget around?   No, in most cases, because we’d rather not remember some stuff.   I keep pictures of the first time I went out with Murti, along with Krystabel, because I considered the time fun. I keep pictures of me with Kristine, simply because I’d like to remember I knew somebody as quirky as here at some point in my life. Even the time Arty came late by hours was provided a great time.   I don’t keep pictures of Jessica, and though this seems cruel, my whole life around that time sucked more balls than a poor whore addicted to crack. Even in my mind, I’ve erased almost all events that happened that one year, save the good times I had with Fudge, Christina, and William.   I think everybody does this, at some subconscious level or another, and those who don’t end up psychopaths. I know this is rather silly sounding, but most of those people simply don’t outgrow such bad memories, and have them playing 24/7 in their head. I know that feeling well, and its shit, imagine having that going on day after day, week after week, and so forth.   I would honestly fucking hate it.   Well, despite knowing that my recent life has been rather gifted, I tend to disregard this fact just like I used to neglect people who I thought just called themselves friends. Some people do just get off calling you a friend and leaving you, but some of the people I know I doubt would do that. Better give them the benefit of the doubt at least   Anyways, back on the matter at hand. I have two great brothers (Both of them seem to like hanging around me now, even though when they were younger they stayed away), an alright sister (she hasn’t stabbed me in the back yet), a great dad and mom (Ha, yes my dad gets pissed off with me for silly things, but hey, parents do that. Get angry at parents at the time, but never keep it, doesn’t help one single bit). I took like 50 pictures yesterday just of my two brothers while they were playing outside, and while I did, I couldn’t help but grin and laugh. Its funny how they can be so annoying or so cute when they choose to be. I wish I could get the photo blog thing to work, but my net is fucked up. I swear, those two kids used to be the death of me, now they’re the reason I smile at all.    My friends are fantastic, even though I take the piss out of them regularly. In the past year or so, I’ve had the time of my life practically doing nothing with them. Just hanging around them not talking is great, since they amuse me even when I refuse to admit it. I don’t think anybody understands why I stay silent when I’m around them, but I feel its easier to remember moments when you’re just an onlooker, and some day in the future, you can just bring them about again even if you haven’t seen them for years.     What I guess I’m trying to reach at in this post is a universal thank you to those around me, something I could never do myself without thinking I’m a general idiot. As well as thanks, I’d also like to ask for forgiveness. This may be too much to ask of most people, but hell, whatever. I won’t go into personnel things about each person, but here are some things I could apologise for.   - Over-reacting (Ha, this is true whenever I really like somebody, I can’t seem to just deal with shit normally)  - Being over opinionated (Dear me, this is something I’ll never be able to help, but what the hey)  - Being a general arse (I can’t be screwed to stick in every single bad things I’ve done so I’ll just classify it as a general arse =D)   How many people read my blog that actually know me is less then five, I think. Probably one in fact. Maybe not even that. I doubt anybody reads, but in a way, that’s why I quit xanga. People I knew read it, and it bugged me just because. I think the only reason I use a blog instead of a real journal is because I can’t be fucked writing by hand xD  I’m off to Puncak tomorrow; get the bracing mountain air into me and whatnot. I love the mountains. Ideally, that’s where I’d get married, which I plan on doing when I’m thirty-so xD I think people rush too much, and it fucks shit up. I know these two people who are already engaged and they’re only a year older than me at most. Fucking silly I thinks, considering they’ve never met in person. Don’t get me wrong, they’re both great people, but I think talking online and talking in person are two different things. I know this one from experience, heh. Back to the subject, the mountains. It’s just so much fucking better than the beach, because for one, you don’t get a fishy smell. I hate fish. I hate seafood for that matter. And you don’t have to deal with sand (This comes out of irritation of having sand stuck in my underwear xD).   My new camera is a blast, I got it for 2 million less then I originally could have, and this includes a bonus bag to carry it in, and a memory stick worth 256 MB. That costs around 1 mill itself. By carrying it, I’m developing hand muscles xD I swear, its like holding the lightest barbell in your hand, and depending on how long you shoot for, you could probably develop muscles.    Anything else I need to cover? No, not really. Actually, I’d like to state listening to Rancid’s  She’s Automatic  (Love this song) and then listening to Marvin Gaye’s  When a Man loves a Woman  certainly sounds odd. Now  Jungle Boogie  by Kool and the Gang is on, don't ask.  I listen to the oddest mix of stuff. On my Winamp playlist, I have music from Athlete ( You got the Style ), MC Hammer ( You can’t touch this ), Johnny Clegg and Savuka (Surely you know the song  Dela ), the London Symphony Orchestra (James Bond theme), Aerosmith ( Crazy ), Daft Punk ( Digital Love ), Iron Maiden, Barenaked Ladies ( One Week ), Coldplay ( Yellow ), Earth, Wind, and Fire ( Dancing in September remix ) and this is just off the top of my head xD   Well, that’s it, I’m off… Later on.
