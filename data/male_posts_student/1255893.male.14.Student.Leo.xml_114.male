So after school I met up with kaitlyn (my ride) and Cathy. We walked over to where her dad was. Along the way though I heard this really loud honk from a car.... It was cathy's dad. I honestly think he hates me. Kaitlyn too for that matter. Cathy's parents are WAY too over protective. After gradation me, Ave, kaitlyn and Cathy decided to go to the mall...... And cathy's mom tagged along! I feel so sorry for her :( its okay .... They'll learn soon enough Cathy.  Well after that we found kaitlyn's dad (he's awesome, probably the only dad of one of my gurlfriends that likes me ..... If that came out wrong then who cares) We all talked about John Ritter on the way over there. It sucks that their making a comedy about his death. Well once we got there me and kaitlyn went to the air hockey, but before we got there ..... We found my dad. I got really scared. He just dropped by to ask me some stuff( don't ask) Well anywho after he left and after winning at air hockey we ordered some fries. During which time Roy arrived. It was kewl, he needs to shave though. A few minutes after he got there jenny came. YAY!
