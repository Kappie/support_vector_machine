I'm the luckiest guy on earth, she makes bad days feel better. today i felt so comfortable lying next to her, to use a cliche, like the stars had alligned. its for real. and in these moments i am content, when i'm lying there,i like just to look at her, watch every little movement she makes, not wanting to blink in case i miss something. so this sounds a lttle stalkerish, but you know what i mean.  wrote a song. this is for any girl who feels like they've been used. or any guy whos in love with a girl whos been used. you'll get it.   can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, she's running off steam from a girlfriend, Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,  Your best friend is her plastic expression, but maybe I'm not sure about your intention, and your fake but she'll keep you guessing, A thousand more and she will cave in,   can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, She's running off steam from a girlfriend, Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,  Your always best left in the tension. do you love her or are you just pretending, just make sure you know where shes going, a thousand more and maybe you'll cave in  can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, She's running off steam from a girlfriend, Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,  you dont deserve her at all stop everything put it all away, you don't deserve her at all drop your tools take off your coat, you dont deserve her at all your a lush so dont work again, you don't deserve her at all drink and drink another trouble,  (you dont deserve her at all) can you take the hint about a u-turn "sorry" the windows tint as you yearn feeling useless around a dead end, She's running off steam from a girlfriend, (You don't deserve her at all) Can you feel it about a moment, i said a hold on as you ferment, i said your fake maybe like a poser, put a poster up looking at a girlband,   see? get it now? well gee, have fun evrybody. i love you.
