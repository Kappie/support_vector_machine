Discussions are great, as long as people are interested in talking about a book.  I personally recommend everyone to read "Fountainhead." Every time I come back to reading this book it elevates me to a totally different level of understanding of life, it's so crazy, it's like a philosophy book but the only philosophy is in the lives of the people that are in the book, I mean it's just great! You have to read it, there are no words of explanation for this masterpiece.  People "die with every day that passes. When you meet them, they're not what you met last. In any given hour, they kill some part of themselves. They change, they deny, they contradict - and the call it growth. At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there had never been an entity, only a succession of adjectives fading in and out on an unformed mass."
