G o stumble out of the room crying like the pansy you are. Fuck it, you'll be right back tomorrow ready with another rabid wombat to shove up my ass. Stupid whore.  If one knows the slightest bit about me, than its quite easy to figure out what I am frothing about - Footloose. Thats right, you've fucking heard it, the beast is slain. Michael himself has come down from the heavens above to slay the seven headed monster, by which I mean a musical based in the 80s. And you know what? Despite all my best predictions, the show actually came through. It took Mr. Foley crying in sheer confusion over how to help them, but those fucking idiots figured out what to do. Except for the Trio. They tried harder than anyone, made the most improvement, but sometimes bad casting cannot be overcome. Sorry girls, my heart goes out to you.  Shows always make me feel wistful, at least they have this year. I'll admit that I'm an attention whore, like most actors, and that being carefully shoved backstage isn't really conducive to my needs. But I can take it. I know that without me, this damned show would have ground to a halt, and without this running crew, it could have been disastrous. Do I get any thanks though? From Mr. Browning and the other 'actors' when they're forced to acknowledge me. But, really I don't care. I can manage to go out into the lobby after a show, and merely stand in a corner why everyone is pissing themselves over hugging those with even the most worthless parts. At least its a musical, so don't feel as bad not playing a part.  But you know what I can't stand - other fucking whiny 'actors'. Actual thespians these people apparently are, with an entire one show underneath their belt. And all they do is whine and bitch about the chorus, complain how their parts are tiny and full of teh magical sux, and cynically scoff at the mere existence of the musical - but once the show is over, their just as ready to soak up everyone's compliments and thanks. Looking for that damn 'adrenalin high' acting apparently gives. Afterwards, they complain chorus shouldn't be their at all, that none of the "non-actors" should be there, that its not for them. What the hell! How fucking conceited are you not to share your miniscule spotlight with a few damn others, just cause they normally don't devote their entire lives to shows, but have this strange ability to sing and do sports instead. I know chorus didn't work that hard, that they pissed and moan, but to take the words from another "Chorus is what makes the big show." If they didn't finally get it through their acorn sized heads that they had to do something, it would have been terrible, rather than above average. So stop fucking bitching about how terrible your life is, forced to share everbody's attention with a few more people. People who are "too cool" to act, "too cool" for drama, yet not "too cool" to have you not expect to lick your fucking boots after a normal show. Shit, how addicted can one be to acting - and I have to wonder if they could survive the "withdrawal" I've gone through. Do you know what fucking happened to me? I loved to fucking act, its was some of the best times of my life, and I loved to be on stage. And the year started great with the one acts. But suddenly, for the fall show - nothing, left out in the cold. Worse than that, I was stage manager - so my job was to come to rehersals every damn day and watch people slowly learn to act.  Fucking watch.  And I also wasted sixty hours bulding your fucking sets, not that you could help. I did more work for these shows than you could imagine, but only now that you've ticked me off do I truly complain - moving from joking to fucking pissed.  And so day in and day out, I was relegated to being Mr. Browning's aside, to watch the slow fuckign realisations that acting may be tough come over your damned faces. I busted my ass so you could come out after a show and get thanked by your adoring fans, all the while I watch, remember what that used to be like, and than feel bad. So shut the fuck up you stupid fucking whores. Jesus Christ.  Damn I'm emo. Llook what you've done to me. You've made me all pissy and moany like you. I need to feel good again. Baby, I never hurt you again, you can trust me. Baby? Baby?
