Thief About!' further reading informed me that some lost soul is going around there stealing... not really a criminal mastermind who ever they are.  The actual optician was a finer guy as any - had a wonderfully dark sense of humour which I admire in anyone, especially in people such as him. 'We'll give you a free trial, come in after a month and we'll sort out payment, assuming you’ll make it back!’  Sadly I couldn't begin decorating today... hopefully tomorrow...
