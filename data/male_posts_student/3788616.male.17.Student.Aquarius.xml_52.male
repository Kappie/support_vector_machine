Well, what's the disappointment? it's about Kelly lah... just, yeah... had a chat with her and found out all the answers i needed to know, so yeah, guess with the disappointment, there is no need for me to point it out right? but, it's so easy to guess... oh well... to be honest, i am not shocked, just that, i didn't realise that i meant so little after so much... but, who can blame her? who can blame anyone but myself... i guess, the only person whom should be sad for me... is... me... no one else is at fault, except me. The pain though, is so very raw, one that i can't control... simply feel like crying, yet i can't... haha... ooh the irony of it all...  Anyway, thanks Kelly for letting me know all that's required. It certainly eased off all my confusion and uneasiness that i felt. Pain came but it shall go, life it but like that, a repetition of events and feelings at times, happiness and sadness... sadness and disappointments come and they will go... eventually, this feeling of pain would go, but, it shall leave a mark, reminding me of all the good times that i've had... but leave the bad ones aside... so yeah, if anyone is worried about me, don't worry! i will be fine... remember this, i have a motto, live life to the fullest! i won't be down so easily and i certainly won't be out so easily... guess, from this however is that i can embrace a set of feelings that i've had for... more openly and without much worry... but, i shall not dabble in that so soon, as the pain is still there, my heart still throbs with pure unspeakable sadness... but... it shall pass... in time to come, and then, i shall revert back to the Colin that everyone knew with an optimistic and everlasting cheerfullness is life...  So yeah, Kelly, don't worry about me... there's really no reason for you to worry about me... i shall be fine... however, though i may be detached and just simply not as friendly for the next few days, please forgive me... yup, but i shall be fine within a few days...  To those that know the other information, not regarding this but the other secret i have... i guess, this pretty much settles the fear that some of you may carry yeah? yeah well... leave me be and give me some room to sort out the rest of my problems 1st, i guarantee that i will bounce back better than ever...  Thus with this, it's the end of but another chapter in my life... Cherie, now hope that you understand what i mean by there is so much to live for, like you, i have gone through much disappointment but i am NOT letting it get me down... hope that you too don't let anything get you down, cause... i think you know why...  Take care everyone! Smile on behalf of me 1st ok? Live Life To The Fullest! (",)
