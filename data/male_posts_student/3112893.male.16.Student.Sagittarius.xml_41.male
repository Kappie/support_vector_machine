Well, it's been like 6 days since my last post, which is, if not surprising to anyone else, is at least surprising to me because this week hasn't been terribly busy, which means that I have like no excuse for not writing anything. That last sentence was run-on, I know. I feel terrible about it.  Anyway, as usual, nothing's happened. Not even any epiphanies. This was quite possibly the most boring week of the past 3 months. I say three months because, for one I can't remember much further back than that, and I remember there being an extremely boring week right around that time where I didn't do anything except work, work, work on a boring project that ended up turning into nothing. I think it was right around that time that I had just finished one of my math textbooks, and whenever I finish one of those things, I take a week-long break and end up spending the time either playing guitar or StarCraft or something, something boring. Random thought of the moment: Halo is fun.  Random thought of the following moment: Smarties are really nasty after two years of being left out in an environment that isn't dry or cool. *choke* *cough* Try to avoid learning that the hard way.  Not that anyone would care about this particular bit of information, but I've had to go to the bathroom for the past 2 hours, but I've been debating whether or not to actually get up and walk the whole 20 feet to the bathroom because of a number of stupid things. One of the few stupid things is the music that's playing. iTunes happened to give me some really good songs in a long list with Shuffle and I haven't wanted to take off my headphones to get up because I would risk missing yet another good song on my list. Another reason is my e-mail. I was working on this one reply for 25 minutes and I worried that if I got up, it would ruin the flow of the message when I came back to finish it up. When I finally got it done and I thought I might have an excuse to get up, another message deserving of a long reply came! After spending 15 minutes replying to that one, I thought "alright, this is it. I finally have no reason to sit here anymore. I can finally go." as I lifted myself out of my chair... but then I heard the sound of doom. *Big drum pounds dramatically* An incoming IM from a certain someone who manages to always get on my nerves after 5 minutes of talking, but I still manage to leave unblocked on my buddy list. Plopping back into my chair, I respond as if nothing is wrong and I have no reason to leave the computer... ever. Acting on this stupidly given cue, she types and types and types, but she doesn't just type statements like she usually does. She asks questions this time. Lots of questions that need answers and fast. Now, this personality of mine is set up such that I can't just leave questions in open IM windows unanswered, so I spend the time to answer her questions. Now, this part's kinda amusing. I'd been holding it for so long that I'd forgotten that I had to go. Then I started this blog post and wasn't reminded that I had to go until I mentioned it. Now at like 2 hours and 20 minutes of having to go, I think I'll try and end this post with something interesting to think about.  I've been thinking about this one for a while and actually wrote a post explaining my thoughts at the time on the issue, but for those of you don't want to read back right now, the question goes something like this: If you believe that god is infinite along every dimension, which can be proven "logically", then why did he create angels? I'm too lazy and I've been holding it for too long to explain the whole background to the question so either read about St. Thomas Aquines or read my thoughts on the subject which contain a brief description of the whole story in my post "Toast" written in early May. That is all.         -- Feanor
