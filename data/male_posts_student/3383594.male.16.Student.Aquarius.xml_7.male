I was juz so sick of it man, even if I get gd results, it was still the mid-yr exams and not the actual 'O' Lvls. So like *yawnz*...  The first paper juz had to be Chinese! *rolls eyes* Haha, didn't expect a pass at all, but I actually did not bad. My paper 1 was 43.5/70, now it's been a long time since I last got such a gd result for paper 1. My paper 2 was shocking, I didn't expect it to be the lowest, I got a 18/80 ... And because of tt I failed my Chinese by 2 marks. Damn! My oral was 19/30 and listen compre 7/10. So it total up to 48% ... But this juz proves smt to me, and tt is I can actually pass. OMG! Haha.  Den came Physics and Chemistry. For multiple choice, I got a 23/40, disappointing shitz! For Chem practical, I got a 3.5/15, not surprised at all. For the Physics Section B  C, I got a 37, which was actually not bad. As for the Chem Section B  C, I got a 37 too, but this was disappointing as I expected to get higher than Physics. But well it's still alrite I guess. So far, my total mark is 100.5/185, there is juz the Physics practical left, which I noe I'll get below 10, so nvm about it. I mean I still pass rite? ... RITE?  The next paper I got back was English Paper 2. Quite surprising results, I did pretty well. Tt was way above my expectations. Haha, after receiving it, my moral was increased by quite a lot too. Hehe, 47/60.  Well, Food and Nutrition was next. Of all the papers I set for, this was my hopeful one. But the results were simply too shocking. I barely pass, 51/100. I was definitely disappointed, shocked and juz had too much emotions. But I still got a 62.5% wif the addition of my coursework, so I guess it realli wasn't tt bad at all. Haha.  After school, I went to the hawker centre wif a few frens. I felt pretty left out in recent times, noe wad I mean? It's like I'm in a different frequency and stuffs. So, yea, I juz kept quiet most of the time cus it wasn't gonna make a difference if I open my mouth and talk. *Sighz* U won't noe how I realli feel inside ...  Haha, I'm not gonna describe my journey home, cus I dun wanna see some1's harsh actions. Well, I went home and tried to study Chinese, but I guess I was juz too tired and there were juz too many distractions. So, I didn't realli manage to get a lot into my head, but at least I tried. Some1 forced me to cum online juz to d/l songs for him! He even said tt I wrote bad stuffs about him, even though I dun remember writing any bad stuffs about any1. Ppl, u all shld've known by now tt everything I write in here is pure truth! So, pls dun over react to it. L0L, I think tt I'm realli gonna bad real bad tmr. But haf no fear cus I'm the One! Shawno OUT! =]
