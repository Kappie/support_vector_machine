In the 70's, Robert De Niro played a crazy taxidriver (I have seen the f***in' movie, so if he doesn't play a taxidriver then you figure it out) who made punk rock history and shaved his head to a mohawk. They just finished filming, Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah star in the film. It comes out in December 2004 or Janurary 2005.
