No, I haven't got a PC with a WaveFinder hooked up to my telly - I own a Netgem iPlayer, a Digital Terrestrial Television STB with internet capabilities. Its capabilites certainly don't match up with those of a PC, but at a price of around Â£100 I think it offers great value for money compared to other less capable STBs.  Shortly, I shall probably blog on the iPlayer's features - and some of its problems.  Nighty, night!
