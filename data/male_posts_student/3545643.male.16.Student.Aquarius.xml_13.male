Maybe I could catch up to her, where ever she was. I started to wonder around the school to try and find out where she had gotten to. Then I remembered her locker number. “216...” I said out loud as I turned and bolted in the opposite direction. 216 was on the other side of the school and I had to get going if I was going to get there before recess was over.  I took roughly 15 steps then it occured to me. Why was I trying to catch up to her? Why was I so focused on talking to her? Just as I had stopped to think, the bell rang and I was late for math... Again...  I made it to the class room around 10 minutes late for class. Great. Math was never my best subject. every one said so, and I knew it. To tell your the truth It wasn’t that I was bad at math, It was that I never really tried. Most of the time I just use to stare at my teacher, and undress her with my eyes. They realize how gross that Is and start to draw. But still.  I noticed that she was in her regular spot at the back of the room, drawing as usual. her hair over her eyes and face.  “miss Jaina, do you think that you can just draw in my course and expect to pass?” Every one turned and looked at the back. There were wispers, snickers. Im sure that she could feel every eye in the room burning into the top of her head. She slowly lifted it, pushing her short redish-brown hair back and just peered at the teacher. There was a long and painfully pause, then “I have the highest average in the class, and probably know more they every you, in this field. So we are at a dilemma, here. Should I keep drawing, and let you get on with your little lesson. Or do you want me to teach the class?” She replied. A smile slowly stretched across her face. All eyes flashed from Mrs. Willies to Jaina.  “GET OUT! NOW!” Mrs. Willies screeched Still smiling “Ok miss, if thats whats you want” With a little chuckle she grabbed her stuff and walked out the door, and I know that every eye was fixed on her as she gave a quick look back at the class as the door closed.  I sure as hell had to pick my jaw up off the desk...
