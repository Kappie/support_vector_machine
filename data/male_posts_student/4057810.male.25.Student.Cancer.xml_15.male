Maybe someone in addition to myself will find them interesting, uplifting, or thought-provoking.  "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence is therefore not an act, but a habit." -Aristotle  "Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow." -Ronald E. Osborn  "Your profession is not what brings home your paycheck.  Your profession is what you were put on earth to do."-Vincent Van Gogh  These last ones I recently found in a book I'm reading,  urlLink By the Sword , written by Richard Cohen.  His words struck a chord with me, appealing to my sense of romance where swordplay is concerned.  He quotes John Keegan on swordsmen throughout the ages, "for whom fighting was an act of self-expression by which a man displayed not only his courage but also his individuality..." and writes about the history of swordsmanship, "at once graceful and brutish, fiercely competitive and technically beautiful, life-threatening and life-enhancing".
