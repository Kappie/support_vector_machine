I freaking slept until 2 in the afternoon!! 14 whopping hours of sleep.   My mom made her yard sale rounds this morning and got some sweet stuff.  She found the Lord of the Flies official CliffNotes which is awesome, though I just finished the book two days ago... I'll sell it to a sophomore next year I suppose.  She also bought a kick butt CD player bundle that came with headphones and a cassette adapter for the car.  BUT SHE GAVE IT ALL TO MY SISTER!!! ahhhhhhg, my cd player doesnt even have anti-skip and the only thing it displays is the track #, not even how long the song has been playing.  ARGH, well I snagged her cassette adapter for my car because it's a lot nicer.  This gave me the idea of experimenting. I brought my cd player and my sister's into my car along with the cassette adapters and found out that the only thing wrong with my sound system was my cd player! I blasted some Yellowcard and I was overjoyed - No cracklin' speakers.   I checked out the Crimson and Veridian rooms (shockwave games) that Dan V. has in his blog, and they are pretty awesome.  I beat them both and only needed one or two hints.  Their only downfall is that sometimes what you have to click on is verry small and you'd never know to click on it, but other than that they're pretty sweet - check em out.  Chris and I drove around town today.  I got sick of sitting in the house so I drove to his house and picked him up after he finished his work at Waffleshop.  Raz and Jesse were working on their chem project so Chris and I didn't really know what to do, so we went and checked out Goodwill since it was close.  The only stuff we found was crap, except for a Disney Princess computer game I might just have to go back and get for my sister.    It was around 7 and I still hadn't eaten dinner so I drug Chris along to Burger King and I got the new Spicy Tender Crisp value meal... IM SPICY!! Oh man did it ever hit the spot.  Dry with ideas, we decided to go back to my house and play some driveway basketball.  The hoop was only about 6 feet high so it was kind of lame, but still fun. When that got old we went in and decided to watch a movie on our home theatre system SHAZAM! The 1990 version of Lord of the Flies came today from NetFlix so we watched that, we are sooo awesome.  The only cool thing about the movie was getting a more visual representation of the book.  It was pretty much just showed muddy kids running around in tattered tighty-whities.  After da mooovie  I took Chris home and cleaned my room.  GAAAHHHH wow I'm going to throw up, my cat dropped a major deuce and its poisoning the house. I should probably go take care of that.   Peace  Chad
