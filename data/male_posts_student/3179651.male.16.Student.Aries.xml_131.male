I told my Mom I'm not doing it unless they knock me out. Oh God, this is going to hurt.  My mom is also bitching me out BECAUSE I'm CLEANING my room. She's afraid i'm going to take the color out of the carpet where the dog peed. Hmm, you wont lemme shampoo it so i'm putting pet stain remover down bitch, like it or not.  I'm off work again because I can't work 9 hours... I told him I'd work the Lunch Shift.
