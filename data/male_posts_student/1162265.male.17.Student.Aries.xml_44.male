Where did I leave my soul? I want to show you what's inside! Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Not in my country, because I was not from here. But then Where!  Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Austria? No. France? No. Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Brazil? No. Hawaaii? No. Oh! Where did I leave my soul? Alabama? No. Manhattan? No.  So, where is mine? I want to show it to you. So, where is mine? I'm sure my sparkles just as brightly. So, where is mine? If your soul is beauty, what am I without one?  Where? Where? Where? Where is my soul?  Oh! God where is my soul!  I guess I turned the anger into sadness, but I lost my original message.
