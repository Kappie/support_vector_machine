And you reverse and you start to drive.    I'm hitching two nights at a staff cabin at Camp Daniel Boone (affectionately known to  urlLink Centenarians  as Camp Big B, even thought Big B doesn't work there anymore.  His brother does though, and his brother is Daniel, so Camp DB still fits.  This place is a usual summer employer for about half a dozen Centenary students, mostly from the TKE fraternity, though looking over the spread of Gent alumni, there's a bit better mix right now.    The drive was quick and relaxed...I love the lack of pressure in a driving situation.  Years ago I would forecast my arrival, letting my friends know a distinct time to expect me.  Not once did I not arrive within 10 minutes of my forecast, most times closer to five minutes, and several times I was perfect.  It was fun and a silly ego boost, but on the longer trips, it chapped my ability to meander, to stop at flea markets, look at potted plants and fruit stands, drive a little slower, think a little more, conceptualize a script.   My best drives are the ones where I conceive ideas during the trip.  I first started this with Will Kordsmeier in 1998, as we drove from Morrilton, Arkansas back to Shreveport.  We came up with a script idea where the world was a television show, and God, Satan, and his angels were the executive producers of the show.  I remember little else of this idea, except that it was pretty poor (it was a cross between Defending Your Life and The Truman Show, except there was a Diner where a lot of the action took place...I think I was hungry for Citgo brand Tater Babies), and Will and I loved it.  I think I found my script for this semester.  It involves Benny Mardones, as well as an idea I've kicked around for years about a guy who wants to be an artist but isn't any good at art.  It's a coming-of-age story.  The goal is to either make it The coming-of-age story, or a coming-of-age story unlike no other.  I would kick myself in the face if someone said it was 2003's  Sixteen Candles .    Asheville is beautiful and rugged.  A cosmopolitian flavor, but in the wilderness outpost fancy.  Lots of friends of mine have passed through or stayed for a while.  I can see why.  People are fit, art abounds, and showers are discouraged.  5 out of 6 men have beards, and the sixth probably just doesn't grow facial hair.  The climate is 15 degrees cooler than the rest of the state, and rent is extraordinarily cheap.  And I think there's a lot of sex going on.
