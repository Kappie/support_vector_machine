I'm not on the road to recovery from drugs or alcohol or sex--no, I'm recovering from this bitch:     urlLink     The splenderous Mary    Getting over a girl is probably one of the hardest things a man can do. Especially this whore--just  look  at her. The hardest thing about moving on from a girl is that there's not much you can really say to encourage yourself. At least dope and smack addicts can tell themselves that by recovering their drug addiction they will become healthier and live longer lives, but being in love with someone who doesn't love you back isn't necessarily unhealthy. And who's to say she doesn't love me? I mean, she loved me at one time, why can't she still? But I guess she wouldn't have made out with someone else if she really loved me.      But enough of that dumbness. I'm broadcasting my recovery to anyone who reads this--which will probably only be  urlLink Zara , since she's basically the only person I can trust to not tell Mary about this blog. Of course I'll publish other shit about me as well, but the main purpose of this blog is to record my hurdle over Mary Hill for future generations. Or for Mary and I to look back and chuckle about when we're married. Which won't happen.         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...
