I have several hobbies(mechanic, welder, demo cars, paintballing, computer geek, electronic freak, and anything i can do to get my hands dirty) i am also the co-editor to the yearbook at my school, speaking of that i need to work on my advertising example.  I also have a missile sitting in front of my garage, not many people can say that, i have many ideas that i am going to work on in this comeing year.  of which include, putting an engine on a shopping cart, and a remote controlled car powered by a weed eater engine.  I am an extreme paintball player, i play on a team, the name is Paintthinner, we just play in my friends backyard but its fun as hell, i have no commitments except whatever idea i am working on at the moment, then that is all i will do, everything else gets backseat.  I am rebuilding a 1986 Ford Bronco, it is going to be sweet when i finish it, i have rebuilt the engine and put a tricked out intake, exhaust, carb, cam on this baby, it also has a 3 inch lift and has 33 inch tires on aluminum wheels, only been working on it for about 2 years, i cant wait to hear it start up, i got the dash put back in last week and my brother is going to come and wire up the sound system he is putting in before i finish the rest of the interior.  then after this thing is done, i have a 1970 MG Midget that i am going to start on, it is a convertable 2 seater, we are looking for a small 6 cylinder to put in it because British parts are so expensive, I just ran a demo car a few weeks ago and for my first run i think 14th out of 26 cars in the feature isnt too bad seeing as how i only died because the inner finder pinched off my gas line. Well i reckon i will head out, i have some sleep to catch up on, its only 2:30 in the morning. i'll write again soon.
