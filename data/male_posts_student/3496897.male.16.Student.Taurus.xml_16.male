It's a bit small, and Once I get a clearer idea with it, I'll probably add more.  *Update* Added More ^_^   A New Age: Part Three   Each sees the world with their own eyes...  A point of view it seems... To which we all shall live our lives... and gaze into our dreams...  An uncommon sight exists in this world...  A vision owned by few...  A side of life with truth unfurled...  a Side you never knew...  Some say the world is a beautiful place...  Others say it's hell... Except for those who've seen this face... There is no way to tell... What is the truth about our ways?  Are we Savage and cruel?  Or is peace closer day by day and everybody's cool? To knowhow to solve the riddleyou  must seek these people out...  To findfolks out there like me too see what this is about... Find the "losers" of society who won't give up the fight... With open hearts they'll let you see Just whats inside this light... To see this world another way...  To look through troubled eyes...  And see this world is not so dark... Beyond Cerulean Skies...  Even when we reach our prime...  There are courses we won't understand...  but few of us will take the time...  to stop and try to comprehend...  What happens when we go and decide?  Take the path and see it through...  What future have we cast aside...?  Few if any will ever construe...  The other choice they might have made...  Be it good, or be it bad...  In most people's minds the thought will fade...  And forget the influence that they had...  To change this world with what they've done...  Really big or very small...  The difference between the whole and the one...  Who will open his heart... and in darkness... stand tall...
