I have no friends...sure I've got people to hang around with but no one to trust.  I realized that a few days ago.  Everyone back here is still living like its high school.  I've grown up and moved on.  I have more fun hanging around my brother and watching tv than going out.  I'm looking forward to Mondo Generator and hoping it doesn't turn into an event as all things around here seem to do.  I'm in the process of writing a letter trying to get the Techno Kids kicked out of the apartment complex.  And for some reason it isn't going so well.  I've been sleeping a lot this week and not looking forward to going back to school.  Although this week has taught me how much I should get serious about finding a job cause if things suck now, they're gonna be that much worse after graduation.   For lack of better things to do, I found out my WPM is around 65 w/o mistakes.  WHOO
