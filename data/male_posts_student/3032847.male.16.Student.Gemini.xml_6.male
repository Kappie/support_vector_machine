Her old one was nicked outside Millhouse Baths, - spent ages figuring out what wire was for what :-0   Just watched the Parole officer  (channel 4 film) , its gotta be one of my favourites!  Me dads been on a 35 mile walk for charity today... meeting people at 7AM, walking at 8, home by 10. And I think I'm more knackered than him. Shame I didn't raise Â£200 for it :-D
