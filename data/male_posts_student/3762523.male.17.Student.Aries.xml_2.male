Political pundits have twisted various words throughout the years, defacing some and redefining others, though alwasy incorrectly. They choose to ignore the truth about what something might specifically be, and instead label the term horrible, and attach it to all forms of things they despise.    I think the most prevalent bastardised terms have to be "conservative" and "liberal". The terms have been adopted by both the Republican and Democratic parties to describe their own practices, when often it is nothing of the sort. But, they've also turned into derogatory terms when used by those of the opposite persuasion. For instance, the term "conservative" has been twisted by the Republicans to support such things as the Iraqi War and anti-homosexual marriage legislation, when in fact both issues are directly contradictory to the word itself. True American conservatism was established during the period around the ratification of the United States Constitution. It developed from those opinions held by the Federalist party, and eventually came to mean an emphasis on smaller, though strong, government, semi-isolationism (only interventionalism in extreme cases), and strict adherence to the Constitution. Now, while conservatism correctly stands for less or smaller government, the Republicans and their self-labeled "right-wing" policies have planted the notion that "right" on the political spectrum means less government, which is something wholly incorrect. Often times Republicans will claim they are the party seeking smaller government, all the while enacting new legislation to restrict marriage and set laws such as those in the USA Patriot Act in action.    Equally misused is the term "liberal", having been connotated with "left-wing" policies by both sides. Classic liberalism was based on the doctrines of less government is better, often emboldening minarchism, and social progress. But, only one of these is correct about the Democrats who use the term for themselves, and the Republicans who slander them with it -- social progress. But, even in the world of social progress, the Democratic Party takes a much different route then a true classic liberal in that rather than taking the power from the government, they place more power in its hands, thus going against the other principle of liberalism. They want Affirmative Action in place to "help"  some  minorities, when the truth is, the only way to make minorities less like minorities is to through of the concepts of different races in the United States, and accept everyone as part of the group. As long as they continue to place blacks or hispanics away from the rest of society, the large the gaps will be between those peoples and the rest of society. Another example is the issue of homosexual marriage. While I feel homosexuals should have the advantage of being married like every other couple out there, I think the underlying fact remains that marriage has no place in the government anyways. It is just another right that the government has  stolen  from us, only to give it back to us in bits as a privilege. The fact that these "liberals" support government control over marriage in the first place is contrary to actual liberal thought.    Of course, those are most definitely not the only terms highly misused. Another prime example is that of Communism. Back in the mid-nineteenth century when Communism first made its appearance to the world through the  Communist Manifesto  of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels it was a much different entity than it is now. In 1917 when Russia first started its transformation to Communism under the flawed concepts of V. I. Lenin and his Communist Party, a trend was started that would carry through for many decades in many different areas of the world. Powerful revolutionaries with flawed concepts like Lenin's would spark governmental overthrows that would all eventually fail before true Communism was ever accomplished. Rather than a true Anarchist society like Marx prophecised about, the powerful revolutionaries did not dissolve their control, and instead ended up creating horribly oppressive, totalitarian states ruled by the iron first of the Communist Parties. But, rather than recognising these failed attempts at Communism as the oppressive, totalitarian states they in fact are, the term Communism was still applied. An entire philosophy of socially progressive political science was tainted by the acts of these new dictators and the millions of people they massacred for their "causes".    Or, how about libertarianism, the term that has been dictated by the American Libertarian Party into something that it's not quite. True libertarianism is extremely close to classic liberalism, and is pretty much established on the same belief that less government is better. It even stretches to the extreme of outright Anarchism. Libertarianism, being one end of the Libertarian-Authoritarian scale of the political compass, is affected by the Right-Left scale of the political compass as well. Thus, both left-wing variants, like those of Noam Chomsky, and right-wing variants, like that of the American Libertarian Party, exist.  Of course, the extreme of Libertarianism, Anarchism, has become one of the most -- if not the most -- bastardised political terms.  What started as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's term for a stateless society has now morphed into some sort of lawless chaos -- something that most definitely not intended.  The term, which describes multiple political doctrines spreading the Left-Right spectrum, is much different to the many dictionary definitions it has acquired over the years.  Anarchist societies in theory are very orderly and free, not chaotic and repressive.  Anarchy, what has become the term for absolute lawlessness, is much different than Anarchism, the correct term for an orderly, advanced society operating sans state run control.    So, what does all of this mean?  Well not much if no one cares.  Most people will still be content with using incorrect terms and definitions, and revel in their horrible diction because it might help them slander one another, or support their point a bit more.  It's easier to debate "Communism" when you use the false definitions and practices of brutal dictators rather than the ingenius social structures invisioned by Karl Marx.  It's easier to combat "liberalism" when it has been adopted by big-government supporters with fancifully retarded ideals, rather than the fact that true liberals want less government and more freedom.  It's easier to take a moral high ground behind the term of "conservatism" because it stands for small government and Constitutionalism, when in fact you are for just the opposite.  I guess Emma Goldman was completely correct when she said, "The political arena leaves one no alternative, one must either be a dunce or a rogue."
