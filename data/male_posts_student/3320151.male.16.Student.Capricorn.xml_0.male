Had geog supplementary today, then band, phototaking, alumni, and lastly a nice chat with a few good friends. Geog.. voting day! Seriously.. if the choices they make are wrong.. we can be in for a VERY screwy 2 years.. and i really hope that doesn't happen. =P well.. band on the other hand.. was pretty much the same.. she even came up to tell me she saw me on tv! when i realised what she meant.. i was like >.
