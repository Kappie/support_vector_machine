Yanou - Heaven (CandleLight RemiX)    OoOh...Thinking about our younger years  there only you and me we were young and wild and free Now nothing can take you away from me We've been down that road before  But thats over now You keep, me coming back for more....  Baby you're all that I want When you're lying here in my arms I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven And love is all that I need and I found it there in your heart It isn't to hard to see were in heaven....  OoOh... Once in your life you find someone He will turn your world around Pick you up when you're feeling down Now nothin can change what you mean to me There's alot that I can say just hold me now Cause our love will light the way....  Baby you're all that I want When you're lying here in my arms I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven And love is all that I need and I found it there in your heart It isn't to hard to see were in heaven.....  I've been waiting for so long  Something do right Love to come along Now my dreams are coming true  through the good times and the bad I'll be standing there by you.........  Baby you're all that I want When you're lying here in my arms I'm finding it hard to believe we're in heaven And love is all that I need and I found it there in your heart It isn't to hard to see were in heaven.....  OoOoOoOhhhhhhhh......... OoOoOoOhhhhhhhh.........  We're in heaven.................................   This song is how I think romantic love should be. All you need is eachother....
