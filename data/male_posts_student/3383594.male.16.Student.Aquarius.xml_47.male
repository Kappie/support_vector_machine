In school, some realli fucked up things happened, I can't tolerate such arrogant behaviour man. When some1 finally gets the chance to take a photo wif u, u can't even smile 1 sec. U think u're some sorta superstar and shitz. Like WTF man, u obviously dun noe wad it means to others. Well, screw tt. When I got home, I was feelin kindda ill, so I took a nap. I also had some relationship problems wif certain ppl, but screw tt as well. I slept till like 7:30pm. I woke up for dinner and watch The Amazing Race at 8pm till 9pm. I refused to reply sms or calls till it was after 9pm. I didnt want to due to certain reasons. I started doing some work for lil' pig and b4 I knew it some shitz happened. My parents were arguing bout' who knows wad and somehow I got myself into it. Well, it was crap and I dun feel like talkin bout it. Luckily, there were ppl who I chould talk wif and they did their best to cheer me up. I told my problem to some ppl, but chose not to tell the rest. Well, I this point of time, I realli dunnoe who actually cares bout' me, so I'm juz making a wild guess and hopefully I'm rite bout' it.  Well, as for today, my main objective was to be happy. I had a choice of being sad or happy, it was totally up to me. So I chose to be happy and I did a pretty gd job to do so. I 4got bout' wad happened yesterday and moved on. After sch was the time to talk bout my situation yesterday. I went for lunch wif Mal at the hawker centre and had a talk wif him. Soon, Derrick and Anwar came and we decided to go and play pool for awhile. Derrick played 2 games onli and left as he had some other stuff going on. I continued playin wif Anwar for 3 more games. I feel tt everytime I'm wif him, it's like so much betta than being wif many other ppl. We get along well and I juz find him to be a realli close fren to me. Well, at least there's 1 person out there. Haha.  When I got home, I uploaded some pics and videos to my com. I sent them to some ppl already and started bloggin. I juz realised tt I hafta complete some stuff, so I guess I'll hafta end here for today. Alrite den, cya soon~ =]
