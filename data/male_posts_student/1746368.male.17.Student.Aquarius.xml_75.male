Some may look to sports. Others may look to books. Still others may think of music.  My inspiration is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. Nobody can take it away. It cannot become weaker, only stronger in time. It listens to my heart and watches over me. It delights in good and always triumphs over evil. It is patient, It is kind. It is always there. It is forgiving. One cannot see It. One cannot overcome It. One can only believe or not believe. It never fails. If you know what I speak of, you would know "It" is not an "It" at all. Rather a whom.  "A 'life' without God is hardly a 'life' at all."
