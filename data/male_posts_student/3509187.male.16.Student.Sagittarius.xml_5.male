Accually I'm leaving a little earlier today so that I can go to Wegman's and get an application.  I hear that they were advertising for part time workers.  I've heard its a pretty good job with great pay.  I'm really hoping to get a job at Music Mart but I haven't gotten a call back yet and its been almost a week.  I also put in applications at a couple of other places.  Where else can I get a job that's like Music Mart? I don't think Robert M would hire me, they have college + people and they seem like "career people."  I guess I should have asked at Rainbow and Alley Cat, maybe I'll do that Firday cause I'll be back in town for the day Friday because of my last day of On-Road... WHOO. I'm eligable to test for my license today, but I'm going to wait until Friday so that I can test with the school cause I've heard it's a lot better to test with the school.  SO what else? nothing? well thats interesting...  Yeah so people keep coming in and all the computers here are being used so I kind of feel bad about using one for something as useless as this Blog... but then I think whats so important that they need to use this computer? and also there are somepeople in here that I have a feeling are not doing anything useful.  Well then... Let me see... Hmm well I've been working on my arts fest Duck Tape Usables... Also I made a pair of sandles... they aren't the best but I like them. I'm going to be one heck of a duck taped kid at the arts fest.  I'm going to wear my RHCP visor, the sandles, a tie, a belt, and who knows what else I will come up with in the next week....  Wow its only a week away and I have to get on this making thing.  I want to make another 4 belts, 20 flowers, a few visors, another hat, some wallets, ties, and who knows what else... yeah I've got a lot to do but then agian it doesn't take that much time, I probly spend more time chosing a CD to listen to then I do on each item.  Time to go bye...  -Dan V
