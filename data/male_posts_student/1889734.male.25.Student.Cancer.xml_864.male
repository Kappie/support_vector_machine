Bush. 02/15/2000, at a debate in South Carolina, et. al.  Truth: 64.4% went to the top 5 percent of taxpayers. 7.7% to the bottom 80 percent.  urlLink Source    Now, Mike: Is it insufficient to say  "Bush lied!"  on  this  one? I think to proove that this is a lie would simply be restating what was above. To cover my bases, though, I'll try to proove there's a lie here before questions arrive:   Here's Bush's quote again: "By far the vast majority of my tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum."  Now, let's look at the facts: Fact 1: The top 5 percent of American taxpayers are not on the bottom end of the spectrum. Fact 2: The majority of Bush's tax cuts went to the top five percent of American taxpayers.  I suppose if you interpret "the bottom end of the spectrum" as "those earning less than the top 1%,"  then  you might have something. Besides a mathematical intellect of Arthur Anderson bookkeepers, that is.  The economy is improving, eh?
