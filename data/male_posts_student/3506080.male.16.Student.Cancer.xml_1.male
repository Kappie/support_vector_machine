I don't really feel like making them read it, so I won't. I'm mostly a passive person, and my favorite hobby is a quiet and peaceful one. I am an impressively good gamer. I am currently working on Halo, and Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, both for the Xbox. That should be enough of an introduction, so...  Right now, i'm listening to my favorite Musicmatch Radio station, Alternative Rock. My girlfriend might be coming over in a few hours, after work. I work at the same place as her, our local McDonalds. It's not bad work, pretty easy, and the pay's not too lousy either. We just got off school, our sophomore year. That's about all I have to say on this post, but i should update often, so keep reading, ok?
