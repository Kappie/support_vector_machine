Ill start with the show, I like shows.  And Im excited about this one.  The people at Youth Go say that a lot of people go to this thing.  That will be good, its gonna be nice to play in front of people we dont know, because its nice to play for your friends, but the name of the game is getting stuff out there.  Frankly, it would be nice to hike on out of Oshkosh for a while and play shows wherever, but you gotta build, and refine, build and refine before you can take the show out to take a shot...I just wish it didnt take so damn long.  I want that new corvette now.
