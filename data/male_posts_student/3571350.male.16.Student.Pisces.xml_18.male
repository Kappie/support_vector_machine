They are acting really immature right now and not a very good example for me. To get away from it all i played tennis against the school wall which is a block away. It helped as I was just focused on playing and not my parents plus I guess you could call it in a way therapy but it doesn't feel like it. Why cant they just STOP THE FIGHTING and go to therapy like I am or just talk it out instead of screaming it out time and time again!! I can't say it enough i am sick and tired of it and I need to get away from this! The fighting is making stressed 24/7 and it needs to stop, someway somehow it needs to stop. On Another topic i love TLC :P I love trading spaces and alot of the shows on there even if my mom doesnt. She doesn't like anything I like which is okay since I want to be almost the opposite of her really. Gonna go now BYE
