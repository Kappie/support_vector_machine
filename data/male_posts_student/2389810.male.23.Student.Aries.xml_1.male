Where there is love there is inevitably hate and evil. That is the dichotomy I went with. I have shown how corporations and lies can jeopardize our health and well being under the mere defense of ignorance. I've also illustrated the lies and agendas that propel people to kill and no I'm not equating the two figures shown. I've also shown the discrimination under the guise of righteousness and the people we have lost to that discrimination (see top right corner). The good and love side is more subtle but has some things youâ€™ll have to find on your own! urlLink
