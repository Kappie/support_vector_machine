Have you even checked through your bag yet to see if anything is actually missing? Maybe that'd be a good idea.   3. Its not called having ones head up anothers ass, its called Bish getting you back for "5 years of bullshit". When Bishop isn't either hyper or generally being annoying he isn't so bad.   That phone thing was funny, and so is the thought of Phil Harnett going skydiving, then realising someone has conveniently removed the parachute cord. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAhem.
