It's mostly smooth acapella singing with a harder rock feel to a few of the songs.   The audio post below should lead to me saying something into a phone between sets inside the bar they were playing in.  On a completely irrelevant note, my dad revealed to me this morning at the doctor's office that our last name (Gould) may not actually be our last name. From what an older member of the family says, it was changed from a Polish/Russian surname that sounds something like Reichoff (pronounced RIKE-off). To hell with my heifenated last name, Nicholas Reichoff sounds much more manly.
