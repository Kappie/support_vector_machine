Either post the number of movies from the list you have seen or list the titles. You have to have watched the whole movie (doesn't count if you rented it but didn't watch it, watched 5 minutes of it on TV, etc.). I think between everyone we might have seen a big chunk of these movie classics. I'll start off, I have seen 17. They are: #2 Casablanca; #4 Gone With the Wind; #6 The Wizard of Oz; #11 It's a Wonderful Life; #13 The Bridge on the River Kwai; #15 Star Wars; #25 E.T. The Extra Terrestrial; #34 To Kill A Mockingbird; #40 North by Northwest; #42 Rear Window; #49 Snow White and the Seven Dwarves; #60 Raiders of the Lost Ark; #62 Tootsie; #71 Forrest Gump; #72 Ben-Hur; #78 Rocky; #86 Mutiny on the Bounty. How many of the other have you seen? Oh and by the way, I've seen the movies in which 11 of the top 100 songs are in, the movies in which 14 of the best 100 heroes  villains are in, 7 of the top 100 romantic movies, 14 of the top 100 thriller movies, and 7 of the top 100 comedies.
