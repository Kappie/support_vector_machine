We got 5th out of 10...stupid Greensburg Salem has to go and take it all away from us.  I still got a medal.  A gerund is a verb used as a noun, and Romeo's last name was Montague.  And the hypotenuse was definitely the square root of 864.  Stupid quizmasters.  Oh well.  It is time to go take a nap.  I'll be back later...maybe.
