They toppled the Giant, known as the LA Lakers, to end a series that was about as one-sided as NBA Finals series get. They took it handily, 4-1, and if they had played their cards right in Game 2 (by fouling Kobe Bryant before he could hit a ridiculous 3-pointer), it's very possible that they could have swept. No one saw this coming. No one gave the Pistons a chance. And that's why it's even sweeter.   On a side note, I love that Kid Rock and Hank Williams, Jr. were at the game sitting next to each other, Kid Rock with cigar in hand.
