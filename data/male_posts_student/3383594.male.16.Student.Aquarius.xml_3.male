I became to realise wad I've been missing for the last couple of years, and that is fun. U brought to me joy and happiness. U always tried to get to noe me betta and juz communicate wif me. At first, I didn't know if u were a genuine and sincere sort of person, but I soon realised tt u were. Wow, time realli flies doesn't it? Look where we are at now. Although we might haf onli know each other for 1 or 2 years, it seems tt we haf a lot to talk about. My feelings to u are genuine and sincere too, I juz like u the way u are. There are times when I made sacrifices for u, wif or wifout u knowing. I realli haf no idea about how u feel towards me, but I juz wish tt it's good. I admit tt there are times when I got pissed at u for a thing or 2, but I never took it to heart. U are the reason why I smile every single day, even when I'm down or out. I care a whole lot about u, honestly, more than my veri own sister. I juz hope u do care about me too in one way or another. Although I do not feel tt care and love frm u, deep down in my heart I know tt u do actually care. Do u still remember the time when I got back my terrible results? U were there for me, there to comfort me. There are oso times when u surprised me wif ur strength, concern and so much more. Honestly, I was shocked by all of it, because I didn't think for a single second tt tt was ever gonna happen. I haf no idea how long this relationship of ours will last, but I hope tt it would last while we're still together rite now. I hope tt u won't forget me if we go to separate schools eventually. But whatever the case might be, I want u to know tt u haf become part of me now and tt I'm extremely proud to haf got to know u."  These are my confessions to u*
