Very funny.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  The knights rush into a cave, huffing and puffing, to take cover from the vicious onslaught of the Killer Rabbit.     Arthur: RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!  Bedevere: Okay, how many did we lose?  Arthur: Well...Gawain...Ector...and Bors.  That's five.  Bedevere: Three, Sire!  Arthur: Three.  And we can't risk another try, that rabbit's dynamite!  All: Hmmmm..  Robin: Maybe if we attack it, it will get confused, and make a mistake!     (pause)     Arthur: Like what?   (longer pause)  Robin: Ummmm....  Lancelot: Have we got birds?  Arthur: (quickly) No.  Galahad: (brightly) We *have* the Holy Hand Grenade, Sir!  Arthur:  Of course!  'Tis one of the sacred relics that Brother Maynard           carries with him!  Brother Maynard!  Bring out the Holy Hand Grenade!  Monks: (Chant)                      Die Jesu domine,                      Dona eis requiem.                      Die Jesu domine,                      Dona eis requiem.     (Pause.  Arthur examines the hand grenade, turning it over in his hands.)  Arthur: How does it....How does it work?  High Priest: I know not, my leige.  Arthur: Consult the book of Armaments!  High Priest: Armaments Chapter One, verses nine through twenty-seven:  Brother Maynard: And Saint Attila raised the Holy Hand Grenade up on high                   saying, "Oh Lord, Bless us this Holy Hand Grenade, and with it                   smash our enemies to tiny bits."                   And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the                   lambs, and stoats, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and                   lima bean-  High Priest:  Skip a bit, brother.  Brother Maynard: And then the Lord spake, saying:                   "First, shalt thou take out the holy pin.                   Then shalt thou count to three.                   No more, no less.                   *Three* shall be the number of the counting, and the number                   of the counting shall be three.                   *Four* shalt thou not count, and neither count thou two,                   excepting that thou then goest on to three.                   Five is RIGHT OUT.  Once the number three, being the third                   number be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade                   to-wards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff                   it.  Amen.  All: Amen.  Arthur: Right!  (pulls pin)          One!          Two!          Five!  Bedevere: Three, Sire!!  Arthur: Three!  (throws hand grenade at the Killer Rabbit)     (holy music)     KABOOM.
