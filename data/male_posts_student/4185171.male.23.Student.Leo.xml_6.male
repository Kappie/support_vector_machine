A few people mentioned they couldn't open the journal attachment I sent out via email a few days ago, so I will attach them here as the first entry into my world of blogging.  7.29.04 12:56pm, somewhere outside of Des Moines  	I handed Dad the wheel of the Mazda about 15 minutes ago after we stopped for lunch at Rube’s Steakhouse (the “Original” grill your own steakhouse.  Is this even health code legal?)  Des Moines seems like a reluctant city.  The good people of Iowa probably decided a long time ago that they needed at least one “metropolitan” area and nominated Des Moines.  Seems logical to me.  	How much corn can one state produce?!?!?!?!   This is ridiculous.  And I grew up in central Minnesota.  I’m sure it’s only going to get worse as we progress westward.  I’m going to poke my eyes out with 6” ceramic gnomes.  (If you don’t know about the gnomes, know only that they are our faithful travel companions on our journey to the Golden State.  They don’t have names yet.) 	Aside from my music collection and my adoring and wonderful father there is only an Ikea catalog, a Rubik’s cube, and some crossword puzzles to keep my mind off the over stimulation that the scenery is providing… I really like that bed in the catalog.  Not that I have anyone to share it with at night.  (Single tear)…  Rubik’s cube is such a frustrating endeavor.  Who invents something like that.  I want to solve it so bad. 	Thanks Dad for pointing out there doesn’t seem to be any birds in the air.  Creepy.  Oh wait, I just say one… and another… My Dad is a liar.  But he is currently demonstrating his vast knowledge of state birds.  He says the state bird of Iowa is the goldfinch.  I have no choice but to believe him even if he is a liar.   	Omaha is still 84 miles away.  2:29 pm, Omaha, Nebraska 	I’ve never been to Nebraska before.  I guess my life is complete now.  Dad was impresses with Rosenblatt Stadium, home of the College World Series.  Well, maybe he wasn’t impressed with the stadium as much as the fact that I new what it was.  I watch a lot of SportsCenter. 	I was pleasantly surprised with the remaining part of western Iowa.  The hills were quite lovely.  I’ve been told that Nebraska doesn’t offer the same kind of visual relief.  My dad says the state bird is the meadowlark. 	There is something unnerving about hearing your own father sing along with Outkast’s “Spread”. 	The thermometer says its 91 degrees in Omaha.  What a shitty city.  At least to look at.  There is a water tower shaped like a coffee pot.  That was cool for this city. 	Dad is upset that he hasn’t seen any fields of sunflowers yet.  I hope it doesn’t turn into bad karma and all we see for three straight hours is sunflowers.  I like sunflower seeds.  I hate playing baseball though.  Mainly because I’m really bad at it. 	I think the gnomes are getting nervous that we’re bringing them back to their previous site of detention, Kansas.  Thankfully this isn’t the case..  I currently favor the names Dextrorotatory and Levorotatory.  They could go by Dex and Levo. 	Ooooh, time for a pit stop.  Flying J, here I come.  5:41 pm, 70 miles east of North Platte, Nebraska (I can’t believe that’s a landmark) 	After getting out and taking care of business at the Flying J (including a photo op for the gnomes) I got back behind the wheel.  I couldn’t tell you how long I drove for.  The time sort of melted together.  I think I passed the same patch of corn 73 times.  But the map says we’re further west now than when I started driving.  It doesn’t look any different.   	There was a giant arch over I-80 in Kearney, Nebraska.  I giant arch was the best they had to offer.  Don’t these people know that they should really be making a bigger deal of historic Fort Kearney?  It was an actual fort in Oregon Trail!!!  That’s something to take notice of. 	There are telephone wires on the right side of the interstate now.  They are some of the most interesting things I’ve seen in hours. 	I’ve noticed a lot of Nebraska license plates are numbered oddly.  They have a few numbers, one letter, and then a few more numbers.  Make a decision.  Numbers or letters.  Stupid flip-floppers.  Who are they, John Kerry?  JK, vote Shrub out of office! 	I’d like to think that the USA wouldn’t have taken in the central part of the country if they hadn’t wanted the West Coast so badly.  There’s no other reason for this to be in America. 	I’m going to try and do some crossword puzzles now.  I like to do them when my Dad is around because he usually knows the answer.  I guess that’s the same reason I don’t like to do them while he’s around.  6:26pm, I don’t even know where we are…  	Things have really picked up in the last 40 minutes.  Okay, 10 minutes.  But I’ll take what I can get.   	First of, I didn’t make much progress on the crosswords, but while working on one the Mazda was brutally assaulted by a piece of wood.  I think it came off of a semi somehow.  I just heard the noise and caught the tail end of the attack.  It appears that the Mazda has escaped without harm.  She’s a brave auto. 	Next, we saw our first road sign for Denver.  284 miles.  It sounds like a lot, but it’s a start.  At least it can be thought about now.  Not that I wasn’t praying for it to come sooner before. 	Thirdly, and unfortunately, lastly in exciting news Nebraska has some hills.  I saw them in the distance and as I write this we have actually gotten into some of them.  It turns out the hills are part around North Platte.  Dad actually remarked that it was “very pretty around here.”  I told him it was only pretty by comparison. 	Now we’re past North Platte.  Thankfully the hills have gone away again.  Whew, I thought they might stick around and ruin Nebraska’s good name.  6:55 pm or should I say 5:55, still somewhere horrible in Nebraska 	We have entered the Mountain Time zone!  Flat as a rock though…  6:45 pm, heck yeah we’re in Colorado. 	There is an instant change in scenery upon entering the Rocky Mountain state.  The land here is very rolling and quite rangy in appearance, as Larry (my Dad) puts it anyways.  Me, I think I eloquently put it as “less agriculturally” than Nebraska.  I’m retarded.  Dad keeps saying that this is what he anticipated Colorado to look like.  I expected mountains.  I’ll show him.  I know that there are mountains here somewhere.  I saw them when I was in that damn Denver airport four times in a week and a half.   	Jon and Dan remained in front of us all day.  They did start three hours before we did, so I guess they can win this round.  It’s okay with me.  I had a kick-ass night before I left, so I wasn’t in any hurry to get out of St. Paul this morning. 	I really like the vibe I’ve gotten from Colorado so far.  It’s got a definite kick-ass frontier feeling to it.  I like that in a state… I’ll be honest; I haven’t gotten out of the car yet in Colorado.  I could be completely wrong about it. 	Dad is confident that the state bird is the Mountain Bluebird.  9:25 pm, Guesthouse Denver Stapleton Hotel 	This place takes a long time to check into.  But I’m glad that we’re finally at a stopping point for the day.  My back hurts, and the gnomes are getting crabby.  There is a pool here.  They should like that. 	Can you have a dog in a hotel?  That lady seemed to think so.  It didn’t look like a seeing-eye dog, either. 	Denver kinda smells funny.  A little like wonderbread if I had to put my finger on it.  Also a little like a donkey. 	Uh-oh, they gave us a room with a king-size bed only.  Dad is going to throw down.  I’m sitting in room that I’m not going to be sleeping in typing.  I should go find my Dad.  Personally, I could probably just crash anywhere tonight.  I’m so tired.  11:11 pm, Still at the hotel 	I thought that I could have plugged into the internet at this hotel.  Turns out to be not true which is frustrating.  I would have liked to send out an email update.   As it is I’m going to watch The Entourage on HBO.  Itt a new series produced by Mark Walberg or something… I know he’s involved somehow.  7.30.04 12:09 pm, just inside the Utah border 	I took the wheel from Denver to the Utah border.  It was a good four hours journey through the Rockies.  There was some very pretty scenery.  (Even the gnomes approved.  I think they finally believe they are not being returned to Kansas.)  Driving in the mountains was kinda fun.  A challenge, but fun.  I wouldn’t want to be driving a Uhaul and towing a Ford Escort like Jon and Dan, that’s for sure.  They again started out much earlier in the morning than Dad and I did.  We haven’t caught up to them on this trip once yet.   	I can’t express how much I love the song “Love Isn’t Always on Time” by Toto.  It’s playing through my ipod right now.  What a good song.  Maybe my favorite to sing along to.  Dad and I have been singing quite a bit this morning.  He’s not very good, but I love him just the same. 	I’m a little disappointed with Utah.  Not the scenery, which is very cool looking.  (Imagine what you think Utah would look like.  It looks exactly like that.) No, what I’m disappointed with is their “Welcome to Utah” sign.  You know the signs that every state has like “Welcome to Nebraska.  It was probably a mistake that you came here.”  I really believe that Utah is missing out.  They are still celebrating their hosting of the 2002 winter Olympics.  That was two years ago.  They are missing out on a huge opportunity to cash with “Welcome to Utah, home of Ken Jennings, best Jeopardy player EVER”.  It should be even easier now to get that sign up with him between Jeopardy seasons to get him to pose for the sign.   	For those of you that don’t know who Ken Jennings is I’m not going to take the time to explain.  Just Google his name and see what you’re missing out on.  Plus, if you don’t know who he is I’m very disappointed in you and a little glad I’m moving away from you.  JK BFF… 	Dad doesn’t know what the state bird of Utah is.  2:42 pm, somewhere in the depths of Utah 	I will hand it to those Mormon’s.  If anyone has the fortitude to settle such a barren land then by all means they can have it.  It really looks like another planet here.  The landscape seems to revolt against itself in large upheavals of rock.  It certainly is beautiful in a sort of postcard fashion.  I can’t believe that anyone really lives here.  I don’t even see any animals.  This only enhances my opinion of Ken Jennings.  7:23 pm, The Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas 	I took over the driving with an hour and a half left in Utah and got us into Vegas.  Things ran fairly smoothly, although there was a brief gas shortage scare.  We had to backtrack through a few towns I’m pretty sure shouldn’t have existed to find a station, but we made it.  Once we got back on the road we didn’t stop until we hit the City of Sin. 	Dad is checking into the hotel now.  I’m sitting off to the side people watching and writing in the lobby.  Nobody really looks like they know where they’re going.  Everyone has a kind of dreamy, curious face on. Dan and Jon are at the Fairfield Inn in Vegas somewhere.  They’re going to call when they are ready to meet up.  It’ll be good to meet up with them after chasing them this whole trip. 	It’s never really being a strong desire of mine to go to Vegas.  I don’t mean to sound like I don’t want to be hear.  I just figured I’d lose a whole bunch of money and pout about it when I did come.  I always figured I’d get here sometime in my life.  Now seems like as good as any.  Maybe I can get good and drunk in front of my father.  That actually is more of a personal goal… I’m hoping to just take in a bunch of things in this city and be a good ol’ tourist for a while.  7.31.04 9:17 am, Hotel Room in the Sahara 	All five of us on our way to Los Angeles went out on the Strip in Vegas last night.  Good times.  Vegas is definitely everything I thought it could be.  Dirty, hot, and overly stimulating.   We started out at the Sahara buffet.  Something was quite satisfying about getting a chance to eat at one of these memorials to gluttony.  Once is enough though.  At dinner the five of us made our plans for Saturday, such as how, when, and where we would meet up in Long Beach.  Dan, Jon, and Dale (Dan’s dad) had to take off from Vegas early this morning.  Thankfully Dad and I don’t take as much time to travel in the Mazda as they do in a Uhaul.   After dinner (Can I even call it that?) we took off down the Strip to see what we could.  After gawking at some of the more extravagant hotels Dan, Jon, and I found a $5 blackjack table in a crappy, err, not so glamourous, casino.  They only reason we went into the Boardwalk Casino is that they advertised $3 tables.  They had one, and it was full, so we saddles up to the “high-rollers” $5 table.  Jon was out of $20 in about 7 minutes and 13 seconds.  Dan and I had more luck.  While I was happy to turn my $20 into $45, Dan managed to turn his into $100.  Lucky Bastard.  I shouldn’t complain though.  I am happy to leave Vegas with a shirt. I hope Dad comes back from the pool soon.  I’d like to get on the road soon.  So would the gnomes.  They think the Circus Circus casino clown is after them.  8.3.04 10:31 pm, 1532 E. 2nd St., Long Beach, CA  90302 Apt #13, my new home! 	What a frantic few days the past few have been.  We got Southern California in the late afternoon of Saturday after a few stops along the way from Vegas.  Most importantly we stopped at the In-N-Out Burger in Barstow, CA.  Many other people had this idea as it was quite packed.  Barstow is really the only resemblance of civilization between L.A. and Vegas.  It’s really not even all that big, but the fact that something is there at all makes it stand out distinctly against the Mojave Desert and Death Valley. 	Dan and Jon had arrived several hours before Dad and I had and had taken care of some Uhaul business beforehand.  They had reserved a room for us at the Motel 6.  It was a thing of splendor.  Anyway, when we got there they had all of the local newspapers out and were desperately seeking a living arrangement suitable for four recently graduated men.  This proves to be quite a task in SoCal.  We never found a place that had four actual bedroom that we could live in.  (For those of you wondering why we were searching for four bedrooms there is actually another Hamline alum coming to school down here that we had planned to live with.)   After minimal success we managed to contact a management company that had a bunch of available apartments that we might want to check out.  Dad and I went to grab the listing.  While we were out we got sidetracked looking at potentially available apartments.  It was during this time I realized how difficult our dream would be and began thinking it might be easiest to find a single apartment and let the others find a three bedroom closer to where they will be going to school and working in the OC.  (Heck yeah I picked up some local lingo.) Dan and Jon thought that this may be giving up a dream too fast, but I was fairly confident that this would be easiest for all parties involved after I had spent the next day wondering the streets of Long Beach dead dialing any and all available properties I came across.  After a full day of searching I finally came across a studio apartment that I felt was compatible with my desires for a new home.  It’s 2, count them 2, blocks from the beach and about 10 blocks from the train station I need to get to in order to ride it up to USC.  After living all four years on campus at Hamline I’m officially a commuter. The past two days I’ve spend getting my ducks in a row so to speak.  I signed my lease.  I’ve got two crazy landlords.  I think they’re a married couple.  Dad had his doubts.  Helen and Henry.  He goes by Hank, I think… Anyways, I believe she is the crazier of the two.  She showed me a few of her available apartments.  About 10 minutes into the tours her zipper on the back of the black pants (I usually think zippers that are not placed on the front of the pants make the pants really attractive.  Helen managed to dispel this thought however) had come undone and her pants started to sag a little few inches lower than God ever intended.  Nothing horrible, but in a way it was all too horrible.  She also brought up odd subjects of conversations such as West Nile Virus (She really seemed concerned about this) and the Muslims taking over Minnesota and turning into an independent Islamic state.  I have no idea where she got this tasty bit of information.  I told her after 22 years in the state I hadn’t heard of this.  She was convinced though.  If not Minnesota, then Wisconsin she said.  Dad convinced her that it was one of the Dakotas just to get her off the subject.  Hank more or less seems to be Helen’s henchman.  Nice guy but more of a grunter than anything. After I got the keys to my new place in hand we unloaded the Mazda.  I’m amazed at how much stuff I crammed into that car.  We then drove up to north Long Beach to pick up a mattress.  I didn’t mention it yet, but I definitely have a Murphy bed in my apartment.  You know one of those mattresses that fold up into the wall.  Well, mine doesn’t go into the wall, it swings into a closet, but it’s the same general principle.   By this time Dan and Jon had found a place that would work for them.  They came to visit me at my place before they went to sign the papers for their place.  The two of them, my Dad and myself went to grab some dinner at La Fuente restaurant.  The Mexican food here has all been really good so far.  Jon got a burrito called the King.  It was the size of a carp.  I’m not kidding.  I’ve never seen an entrée that large.  It was such a marvel that I had to get a picture of him with it.  It was like eating a forearm. Today I took Dad up to USC.  Except that I got a little lost along the way.  We got off on the wrong train stop and ended up walking an extra 4 miles through south central L.A.  Builds character.  We did eventually find USC.  I picked up my relocation check and changed my personal information with them.  We then went to the bookstore so that we could pick up stuff to outfit my family in USC Trojan apparel. On the way back to my place we picked up a bike for me that we had shopped for earlier in the day.  It’s a steely baby blue GT combination street bike.  I’m glad Dad was there.  He knows a lot about bikes. After another run to In-N-Out Burger for dinner (this time in Seal Beach) and another run to Target for more apartment supplies we came home for the night. Dad has been a lot of help on this trip.  I’m glad he’s here.  I have a feeling I’d be in a cardboard box if he wasn’t.  Tomorrow we’re going to Ikea in Carson.  How pumped am I?  Quite. I should also learn what the state bird of California is so that I can learn to appreciate, love, embrace, and hunt it.  Well, maybe not hunt.  8.5.04 12:02 am, my apartment in the LBC 	Ikea is so sweet.  Dad and I spent the afternoon there.  When we got back I spent the rest of the night putting together the stuff that I purchased.  I gotta say I really like what I got so far.  I say so far because we’re going back again tomorrow to indulge even further with a shelving unit.  I really like this desk… 	The funny thing about Ikea is the same funny thing about Las Vegas.  The whole place made me feel disoriented and totally off task.  I didn’t really know where I was supposed to be or what time it was.  I just knew that I was having a really good time.  And in the end I guess that’s what any good place should make you feel. 	I like living alone so far.  At least setting up to live alone.  All the decisions are mine.  No one else’s opinion matters about the way things look or how much they should cost.  It’s up to me and I like that.  I’m such an independent spirit.  Maybe not, but it doesn’t matter. 	We’ve been on this crazy journey for a week.  I probably shouldn’t call it a journey because it’s really a more of a destination.  Plus the word journey is used way too often in reality television, to the point that it makes me hate the word.   	The poor gnomes have been cooped up in my apartment while Dad and I took care of business setting up my apartment.  They still have dopey smiles on their faces though.  They’re such good sports.  I should take them to the beach soon as a reward for their excellent behavior.  8.6.04 (my birthday!!!) 7:08 pm,  1532 E. 2nd St, Apt #13 	Today is my birthday.  Because of the situation it’s a lot different from my past few birthdays.  Which is to say that there aren’t a ton of people and mass quantities of alcohol being consumed.  It’s been pretty low key.   Dad and I went to the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach.  We both figured if I didn’t go in these first two weeks I would never go.  It’s probably true.  It was a really nice aquarium, and I’m glad I got to go.  Way too many kids for my taste.  We ended up leaving when   This is Dan.  Kiah left his journal mid-sentence when Jon and I arrived.  I’ve never written in somebody else’s journal before.  Can I share my thoughts?  Seems like I should reserve those for my journal.  Happy Birthday Kiah.  We got sick of them.  Then we went to a nice seafood restaurant because that’s what I was in the mood for after viewing all those fish.  Jon and Dan are here.  Time to rip up Belmont Shores.
