Something about the wee hours of the morning with computer parts sprawled across your lap and bed that makes you feel really...hyper.  And I have to get up early in the morning =\  Oh well.  I haven't published much, but that's because I'm lazy.  Mhm.  I really should update more often though.    More to come later today.
