Teenage ninga turtles was a favourite. Yes, another corperate demon, but its one that worked.  one had to admit that the plot was predictable after a while. And theres only some many times one can see shredder get his arse kicked. poor Wang bastard. But indeed April was hot. another Favourite was He-man. Not that new shit. But the old school HEMAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. The way of the true jedi. i even can remember entire episodes. but there was a similar complex with this one; it just got repeditive. But it was alright for a 6 year old who liked familarity in that fucked world of 1992.   Transformers. Thomas the tank engine! THOMAS! Ringo Starr. Ringo was the life of thomas, he just was; goood. as a result i seem to automatically biased against the other beatles. yeah Lennon! At least ringo didnt get shot you sook! Yoko this *Finger*  i was an avid television watcher, i think i even learnt how to use a VCR at the age of 7. yes, Record too! I grew up on Tv. in london there isnt much esle to do, and i already had a habit when i came here. television was my friend, but i outgrew it. i hardly watch any tv. i feel, that the television now is for another age. the cartoons today, are not like my childhood ones, with the galent hero, or heros. Flash gordon! Batman! Spiderman (though he came later) Superman (i never liked superman) the phantom (he was cool sometimes) X-men! (that came later, 1995 but i think i watched almost all the episodes CABLE HAS MAD SKILLZ) but today's pokemon, digimon etc, are no attraction. theres something sissy about sending an animal to protect you. Fuck off! i prefer a big long sword instead. power of the cards eh Yugio? how about  the power of Erternia!! although Yu-gio is pretty cool. Ruff from Dennis the menace is way cooler than gofuckyourself-mon.  i still follow these craze tv shows and so on, i dont know why, i just seem to have a basic knowledge about them. and thus i can always connect with the young boys. (6-12) cause i can speak their language.   It was an era. an era that resurfaces when the stations dont have the next seasons of the new stuff. and i feel glad that kids fall in love with the same stuff that i did. because then it creates a bridge between generations.
