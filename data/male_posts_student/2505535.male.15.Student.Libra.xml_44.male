Friday was really cool, me, Dave, Matt, Luke and Wellsy went to Adam's, we spent most of the time out of the house. Adam lives in a proper village where everyone seems to know everyone, quite a nice place. I dunno how much I can expand on that, but I might explain it in person (or on msn) if *you* ask me.  Saturday was tiring, I wasn't feeling too well, and there was the routine clarinet lesson and lazing around. But I played alot of Warcraft and tried to avoid the internet, and my Dad came back from Sweeden, apparently the country is 3/4 times bigger than the UK but has a population smaller than London, almost no-one no-where, like looking out into a city center and seeing 2 or 3 cars parked and a few people at max. Apparently houses are much much cheaper there aswell, but high taxes due to the electricity, gas, water etc.. having to spread so far.  Sunday wasn't so fun, didn't go to Alice's in the end, but I did play alot of Civ3 - I have relit my addiction to that game.
