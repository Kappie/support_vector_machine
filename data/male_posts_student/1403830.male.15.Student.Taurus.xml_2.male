There are things I want to do.  I just don't know what.  I think that this is the problem.  I feel empty, like I'm in a holding pattern, or I'm out of the loop, and then I wonder why I'm not motivated to do anything.  It's probably that I don't know what I'm doing, so I'm not going to see the end goal.    I had a fight with my mom yesterday.  I was at Steve's, watching a movie with him and Eli, and she said she was going to pick me up at 9:00.  Too early, but I try to make it easy, she's the one doing me the favor.  Steve's street is set up so that there's a place that has his same address but it's a block up.  Long story short, she drove around for an hour looking at me from 9:00-10:00.  I don't know why this woman hates me.  Hold on, let me clear my throat.  I do.  I am -not responsible -lazy -irresponsible -lazy -not responsible -bad -spoiled -lazy -irresponsible  in her eyes.  Why don't you do this and that is all that she tells me.    She wants her little boy back,  I want to come back.  But I can't, because everytime I make peace with her, I end up making things worse, and feeling like I'm wasting my time. So, here I go, off to try and meet your demands again.  Let's see how long it lasts.  -scs
