I guess for a lot of people graduations are supposed to be a huge thing, they're supposed to be one of the biggest days of your young life. for that reason, due to all the hype surrounding it, that i became excited about it. And although I was also MC i wasn't nervous at all. but it came and went (with me barely paying attention to any of the people speaking and being caught off guard when i had to go up). The most memorab;e part of the whole thing though was when my partner the mistress of ceremonies, after having been told multiple times that the mics were still on and picking up what we said close to them, was trying to put on her hat and grew frustrated and said right into the mic "screw the hat". It was more embarassing to her than anything else.  later on that day, after the limo ride, was the banquet. Sadly the speeches at the banquet i actually listened to and with the exception of the salute to the students, they were all a disappointment one way or another. the tribute to the parents was impossible to hear, the reply from the parents became a little boring at the parts that you could hear. And, like i predicted, the class historians was a roaring failure. I've seen class historian done successfully only one time, unfortunately these two didn't seem to have to ability to get the communication with the rest of the graduating class that would actually make it a good speech. Oh sure some people thought it was great, although tey fail to realize that they were among the minority that the speech catered to. But it's over and a speech is just words right? but all in all the whole nigh was great, to bad it's over and i'm technically supposed to get on with the rest of my life. Psht! screw that, i'll live at home forever! i'll show them...wait a minute... -Matt
