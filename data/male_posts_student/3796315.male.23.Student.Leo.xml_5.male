The whole house is more lively with the 2 girls around. I had home cooled dinner for the past few nights, yumyum.  Couldn't access the net till now, using my neightbour's computer. It's my 1st week here and i am enjoying myself. Watched the Euro 04 at a pub and qhat a surprise, the Greeks won!!  Another 2 friends(jeremy and angchor) joined me on the 5th for a 2 weeks holidays. We went to Byron bay to catch the sunrise, it was freezing. But the scenery was nice, saw lots of dolphins and whales at the coast at it is the migrating season.
