This latest release in the America's Army game series continues to focus on the critical, specialized role of the Army's Special Forces within the U.S. Army as they fight the Global War on Terrorism, but expands the scope to include Stryker vehicles, and the M136 AT4.    New Weapon :  The M136 AT4 (the Army's primary light anti-tank weapon) is a recoilless rifle used primarily by  Infantry Forces for engagement and defeat of light armor.    Stryker Armored Vehicle : This version of America's Army introduces the Army's new Interim Armored Vehicle, a.k.a. the Stryker. The Stryker vehicle is currently implemented as a stationary vehicle with a fully functioning .50 cal turret usable by the player. The Stryker turret zoom in/out keys are defaulted to the MouseWheelUp and MouseWheelDown keys, however they can be changed through the settings menu.  New RPG and AT4 3D Ironsights with Adjustable Range Settings: Both the RPG-7 and the AT-4 have new adjustable 3D ironsights in this latest version of America's Army. These weapons both have the new functionality of 'adjustable range settings' based on the distance to target. The RPG/AT4 can be set to the following ranges: 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 meters.    New 'Tournament Mode' : This version of America's Army features new tournament mode features, which are accessible either via the command line or a GUI interface. These include an adjustable pre-match warm-up period with an in-game notification that the match is beginning. The time remaining until the  tournament start is also displayed on the score screen, as well as in-game reminders, and a final 10-second countdown.    New Demo/Kiosk Mode : New in this version of America's Army is a Demo/Kiosk mode. This 'Demo Mode' allows for the game to run demos either at the press of a button or after a customizable set time limit. This demo mode allows for the gameplay to be demonstrated without having internet connectivity. Player created demos can be used in this demo mode as  well.
