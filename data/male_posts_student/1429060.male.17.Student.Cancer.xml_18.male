A wondeful site, I should say. But be wary what you find there. Your mind might split like a cantaloupe.  Second it is Becky Becky Becky's blog because I told her she needs a blog and who cares that she doesn't have anything to put on it? Go there now lest I smite thee.  urlLink Becky's Mind . hehehehe everyone really is on a blog these days.  I saw the crew this afternoon turning south onto White Station. Specifically, Laylee and Becca. Cue the twilight zone music. Actually, it was in mid-turn that we saw each other and waved frantically. It was fun.  Cheers, humans.
