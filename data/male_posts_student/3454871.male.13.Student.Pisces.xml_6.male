Jordan Knox was in there getting his business project ready. He had candy and I was begging but... he's a jerk and refused to give me any. First hour we took notes and read out of the book. It was quite boring. Second hour we made a Chilly Peanut Butter pie which we will eat tomorrow. During third hour we got an extremely easy assignment because it's on the fun dot paper. Fourth hour we got ready to watch the birth of a baby tomorrow. How gross is that? Very if you ask me. At lunch I ate but was really quiet because my PMS was getting to me. Outside I kept trying to do cartwheels but I just can't do them. Sixth hour my MCs really got excited so I had to go get aspirin from my mom. Then I got sick so I didn't have to do any singing. In gym I had a mini breakdown. It wasn't fun at all. I got to go up and talk to my mom and she straightened it out with Mrs. B and it was all good. Seventh hour we watched a movie. It was so boring. After class I had to stay late because I missed the vocab quiz and I needed to take it. During social studies I finished my test and watched a movie. That was boring too. But whatever. It's way better than having to learn stuff. After school I came home, did my homework, went to McDonalds to eat (saw Madeline B and her mom... I babysat Madeline with Kirsten), then came home and did more homework. I did homework until 9:30. That's how much homework I had. ITS NUTS! I bet you're gonna see the time on this and go but it's 9:06 while shes typing this. Well now I need to go so I can do my Social Studies.
