My route today was awesome...didn't realize I could bring a hottie along, stop and go swimming, do other naughty things, and still get home at my usual time with a full evening for getting bitten by ants while rolling around at the airport. Oops! I guess it wasn't all perfect. Such is life, but dealing with it as it comes is the best way to attract everyone in life, so fuck it. I can't stop smiling...    What's on the Alpine?
