Well, rest assured, fellow citizens: Jim Labs is working around the clock toward a foolproof solution to all of these problems.  AND YOU CAN HELP!              Funds transfered to Jim Labs Offshore Holding Account have no guarantee of being used toward ending the universe.   "How," you ask, "could 'Jim Labs' possibly be able to pull off this amazing feat?" you might also ask: "Isn't 'Jim Labs' just you and your crappy computer in a sewing room with poor lighting and lots of dirty laundry?"  To the latter question, I would most likely respond with wit and cunning, something to the effect of shouting "YOUR MOTHER!" or curling up into a fetal position and crying like a little girl.  To the former, however, I would simply say:  "Destroy the Universe."   To which you would most likely respond by bludgeoning me to death with the nearest heavy object before my horrible horrible designs could be unleashed upon existence, or, possibly, screaming, "ARE YOU INSANE?"  Sanity has nothing to do with it. We here at Jim Labs  (allegations of Jim Labs simply being Jim McGee in a sewing room with a crappy computer and poor lighting and dirty laundry are completely unfounded and repetition of these slanderous lies will most likely end you up in a federal penitentiary with a 250-pound cell mate they call 'The Shredder')  believe staunchly in the righteousness of our cause, and are working day in and day out to bring an end to the failed experiment known as 'Existence'.     One of Jim Labs' many state-of-the-art Research and Development facilities across North America    SOME OF OUR CURRENT STRATEGIES:   Elimination By Logical Contradiction and/or Paradox    Our most ambitious effort, the Jim Labs Paradox Division has a specially trained team of mathematicians (volunteer precalculus students), along with physicists, engineers, and our esteemed Project Director, Dr. Emmett Brown.      MATHEMATICS:  Prove that 1=0. Existence=Nothingness. Maybe while the seams of reality are unraveling around him, my math teacher will finally admit he graded my midterm wrong. That'll show him. Or maybe we could divide something by zero. Or trick the universe into taking the square root of a negative number. We're not really sure... most of the staff has been busy studying for midterms.   TIME TRAVEL:  Doctor Brown has a vested interested in this project, being the inventor of the world-famous Flux Capacitor. Armies of our staff are presently engaged in traveling backwards in time, in order to have sex with/kill their relatives before they are born. Sickening, but all's fair in love, war, and toying with the fabric of space and time.  (The brave employees of Jim Labs who attempted to travel back in time and prevent the Big Bang from occuring came back with nothing but failure. And really, really bad sunburn.)   PHILOSOPHY:  We've put two monkeys trained in basic language skills and metaphysics, in a room with a stack of bananas, with the axiom "I Think, Therefore I Am." And we're not letting them out until they disprove existence.    A Really Gigantic Bomb No, really. It's Frickin' Huge. Enormous. Immense.    Nothing much more to say about this strategy. This explosive device will have the destructive capacity of one hundred bajillion gazillion nuclear bombs. There won't be much left of the universe except for space cockroaches. If they exist. Which we're almost certain they do. And then, the Really Gigantic Bomb Mark II (it's Destructarrific!) will take care of them.   We're starting with some firecrackers and bottle rockets, and working our way up. That is, if we didn't use them all to blow up frogs.  Um. Next strategy.    Waiting for the End of The Universe    This is our fail-safe plan. Modern cosmological theories indicate that the universe will eventually die, whether by collapsing in on itself or expanding into nothingness. It works, but... we're impatient. And bored. So shut up, stupid.    Pretending It's Not There    Some scientists have stated that things don't exist unless we observe them. So, Jim Labs has started a grass-roots and major-media campaign in order to organize the entire populace of the world to Ignore Reality.   What's YOUR strategy? Comment, and you might just have hit upon the perfect plan. The lives of 7 billion people hang in the balance... let's end it now.  End Transmission.
