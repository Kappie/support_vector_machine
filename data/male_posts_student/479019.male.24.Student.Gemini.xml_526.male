All I can say is that shows at Chain Reaction during summer never disappoint. There's something about a hot sweaty venue and crowd that makes for a crazy sort of energy. I'm actually not a big fan of hardcore, but the energy was amazing. I only know a few Rise Against songs, but it was enough to keep me going for the fucking intense 30 minutes set in 100+ degree heat in there. I was drenched when I walked out of the place.  I'm fucking hungry... time to regain the weight I sweated off earlier.  ****
