At first it was gonna be a normal day, seeing as we were getting our asses kicked through excersize and streaching ( the splits = ....PAAAAAAAAAAAAIN!!!!!!!!). then the master surprised us by having the class split up into 2 groups of 6. We had to do ..... *drum roll please* ..... KOREAN WRESTLING!!!!!!! What made it even better was that I had to face my sister. A little bit of an uneven match,  but still cool. for those of you who need a little insight as to how that works, what korean wrestling basically is is 2 people hold on to each others belts and try to take down one another.  So after my team won, the other team had to carry us around the dojo. I felt really sorry for the poor kid that had to carry me, but oh well. L8R people.
