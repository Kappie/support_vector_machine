Yet it shows up fine in Blogger, as it does in my Page Editor.  I tell them this, but that doesn't matter.    I'm beginning to think I'm censored.  I was censored once before, Spring of 1999 at Centenary.  On my homepage, I made a whimsical reference to offering porn through my webspace, which linked to a picture of a clothed President Ken Schwab holding a dog, in a picture taken from the 1997 Student Guidebook's famed discourse  The President's Pen .   The page was up for months, and at one point it drew praise from the President himself, before he knew me as the KSCL mercinary.  Two days later, however, the site was down, and the webmaster told me that it was  unprofessional  of me to have that up.  Whether that was the case, I said, it didn't matter...I had freedom of speech on the webspace.   Oh,  she said.  well, there's a copyright infringement with the photographer.   I didn't press the issue.  Today I would.    Joseph Arthur -  Honey and the Moon  is rocking me.  I've got a bed, decked out in red comfy sheets.  It's a twin, which might cost me a sex life, but I'll save money on condoms and sheets, as Twin sheets are ridiculously inexpensive.  And maybe I can turn that savings into enough PBR to convince the girl that sessions on my dorm-style bed are worth the sacrifice of post-coital comfort.    I'll be up late tonight.  The room's getting to where it needs to be.  It is my room now.  I can write in it.  I can keep the TV off (if The Practice or NFL Football isn't on), throw on some music, and work on the screenplay.  Or the blog.    It comes back to the honesty, folks.  To produce art is to expose honesty in all facets.  The blog sucks when I'm not writing about what I want to write about, because I don't want some people to see it.    Tonight, after viewing  urlLink The Match-Factory Girl , a movie I thoroughly enjoyed but my screenwriting mates did not, Tripper and I got into an argument about the scope of the film.  Tripper thought it was throwaway bullshit...he didn't see a plot, said he could tell the story in 10 minutes, never cared about the characters.  His rhetoric was so goddamned arrogant that I struggled to begin counteracting it...when I'd mention that it was a character piece rather than a plot vehicle, he'd say the characters were one-dimensional at best.    In a very base way he is correct, as we only learn what the director wants us to about his characters.  But foreign film is an extremely different beast from Hollywood, and the cultural schema of these works relates to their audience...which would be their country's folks.  Tripper spoke as if he assumed Hollywood film was for the world, and foreign film was only meant to breach a local audience.  If he's right, it's only because foreign audiences are willing to learn American nuances, while we are not willing to give foreign cultures the same respect.  I'm not an expert on Kaurismaki's work, or Finnish culture, but I'm willing to give the work respect, even if there is no dialogue until the 12th minute.    After Tripper experessed his all-knowing views, I told him I hoped he would say the same thing to Mitko, our screenwriting professor who said we needed to see this film.  It was the only barb I could really throw, and in that it was the most scathing barb...I knew of his presumptuous bluff:   Of course I'm not going to say that to Mitko .  Even though Tripper thought the film was a waste for us, because  Hollywood types would never read that script , he won't express his concern in class, instead sitting quietly while Mitko and I and probably Dave Hahn talk about the strength of Kaurismaki's characters.    I've missed out on several lucrative opportunities because I don't eat ass.  But I've lived an almost constantly happy life.
