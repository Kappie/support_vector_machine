I don't know, but why can't they just make it open in a new window?  Either they assume you're not on a form page or they assume you don't want another window open.  Sometimes I wish AIM would just got to hell and we could all have and open standard like IRC for chat.  Better yet, a peer-to-peer IM system would maybe be more efficient.  No one likes to look at the AOL ads on AIM.  Hell no, I don't want 3000 hours for 3 months free.  Don't you already know  that you sent me 4 CDs with the latest version of AOL on them?  Who's the guy that works for AOL that's in charge of sending out these CDs?  I want to find his home address and start up a site to have people send all those CDs to his doorstep.  Wouldn't that be a crack-up?  In any way, shape or form, I don't think people want to hear about how many free hours they can get for AOL.  I have a feeling my mother is going to yell at me and tell me to go to bed so that's what I'm about to do.  Song of the moment: "Going to California" by Led Zeppelin  Good night.
