Especially mine, so many troubles and problems poping up everyday. You know, every morning I wake up with a hope that this day might bring some light, it might do some thunders, but it hardly happens, you see..!! Its nothing like that Im disappointed or something. Its just one's patience has its limit, yeah...!! The night before, i badly needed to talk to someone, and to my luck, there was no one i could speak to. So i signed in on internet and looked there, had few peeps but they were either in good mood or were busy in something important of their own, so I left it unsaid. I spend the whole night staring my roof, wondering what it is made of? Frankly, I have no idea what i am putting down here coz its just so aweful. Leave no comments here ok?
