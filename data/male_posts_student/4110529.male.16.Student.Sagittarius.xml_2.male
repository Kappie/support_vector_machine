I usually speak to them in English, as they all have at least a very functional vocabulary specific to a few things, including buying lunch.  There are certain assumptions that one must make for them, including that they will want small a brown bag for their forties and a paper bag to put the six pack in, and, since the whole exercise is so very routine and rote, the exchange is usually not noteworthy.  Today, however, a customer of the hispanic persuasion bought lunch and, upon my giving him the change thanked me with "Gracias."  I responded reflexively with "De nada", and thought nothing of my choice of language, polyglot that I am.  However, I mentioned the exchange to a colleague from Spain whom, do to his fair features, customers not at all unlike the one with whom I had earlier exchanged call "Gringo."  So now I wonder if I was being a condescending jerkface when I said that.  Comment time!  Returns Ladies and Gentlemen of this beautiful country of ours, I stress to you that if you do not intend to purchase something, please, please, please do not take it to the checkout counter with you.  I know that you thought that the milk was sour before you picked it up to put it on the belt, and I know that you had no intention of buying you child the "Finding Nemo" sippy cup, and I know that you had checked how much money you had with you and had heard of sales tax before you came in, and that you already knew how expensive the grocery store where I work is, so why can you not take the forty five seconds to put it back where you found it.  None of the cashiers really shop at this supermarket; it's too expensive.  We shop at Shop Right, Stop  Shop, or The Grand Union.  We don't know where to find the things you picked up and dropped in the returns bin like an unwanted baby on a church step.  So I, with my very limited and not at all specific knowledge of the store layout, nonsensical signs and very contrived and bizarre distinctions between genres of grocery items, set out to return a full cart full of rejects.  The character of the rejected item is, usually, not that of the staple item that you actually write down on your shopping list.  It is unnecessary and thus to be found at the very bottom or top of a shelf, or on the ends of the aisles, or some such.  The quest lasted over an hour, as I have been historically bad at seeing what I am looking for in plain sight.  Another way to consider the plight of the returner is to consider how long it would take you, knowing where you found the item, to replace it, add time it would take the poor, doe-eyed clerk to find its place, and multiply it by about fifty.  That's how much I hate you, you lazy, inconsiderate fool.
