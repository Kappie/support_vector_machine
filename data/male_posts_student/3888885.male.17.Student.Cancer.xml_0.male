Jez failed my recent tests... but guess i cant do nuts abt it. i'm a mat.  ok fine mayb i'll jez write abt wad's been happenin 2 me dis past june.  hmm where do i start?  june wuz a rather bad mth 4 me. Evrything bein thrown at me simultaneously. ok fine so i deserved the blasting my vball senior gave me for comin late for practice and bein in improper attire. damn i forgot those shorts. but wad happened after tt... Freakish.  Soufiyyah (or simply, Yah) is my cousin. for e past mth or so, she had been suffering frm e effects of a disease so named the haemophagocytic syndrome. A very rare disease (4th known case in singapore) which affects the blood and bone marrow. platelet count, blood count were all down. seein all those needles pumping alien substances into her body... i felt sad. wish i could've done something for her too. well, god has saved her from her suffering. she left us on the 6th june 2004. overcome with great grief. I could do nuts. i'm a mat.   Still sad about what had happened. No mood to study liao, even tho i wuz gearin up 2 chiong 4 dose upcumin tests. started doin simple sums b4 e passing of my late cousin, peace be upon her. after that, i jez cudnt do anythg. she wuz such a gd girl. 11 yrs old. so young. so full of potential. e world had so much 4 her. but i guess what we cudnt give her, god can now bestow upon her 2 no end. i'm happy 4 her tho i'm sad 4 the family. a mat is full of emotions u noe...  ok mourned 7 days. still didnt feel like doing work til finally, i decided i had 2 put it bhind me. wounds healing right? well it reopened with the loss of another loved one. My gf... I loved her alot. she was the one who would always pick me up when i fell down. if not for all her encouragement and positivity, i'd not have been where i am 2day. my o-levels wud've been far mediocre than it had been. my world wud've been bleaker. we shared plent of happy memories 2gede.   well she sed she luved me too... tt wuz til 21st june. she had just returned frm indonesia tt time, and did alot of tinkin over dere. it wuz den she decided tt she didnt noe if she had indeed luved me or jez lyked e feelin of bein luved. n she also didnt noe if she wuz reali ready 4 a relationship. i felt hurt, but i knew i cudnt hold her back. i encouraged a break up even though she didnt request for it. anyway, she accepted it. again, i'm grieved. my fate fails me.  I tot i cud recover. apparently not. with the opening of each wound cums e memories of old. it jez piles up u noe, waitin 2 topple. so anw, i'm left with no mood to do study anymore. also, had been skipping vball practices bcos of e lack of mood, frm both incidences. no training, no study. jez rotted at home.  Took my tests without mugging much. needless 2 say i did VERY badly. e o o f. cant even form a word w dose grades. disgusting. pathetic. i'm a mat i guess...  Also, cos of ponning all dose practices, i had been approached by my captains 2 quit vball, 2 make training sessions easier 4 e trainer 2 cope with. evry1 increased greatly during e holiday trainings, and with such a level of difference, e trainer wudnt b able 2 deal w me too well... fine, i got kicked out.  my life at present is a mess. bad mth, failed tests, no cca. bad enuff? we'll c.  i'm a mat. a mat is a failure of society. i'm a failure of society.  Mat Rai out.
