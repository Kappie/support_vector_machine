I was very proud of myself. I get 20 pages in to a very short book, and I go back to play games. I need to shapen up before I crumble at the base. I don't even know what's going on anymore... I don't have any incentive to do anything -- homework, socialize, play games. Its all starting to lose its feel to me. I tried drawing today, and I put my pencil down 5 minutes later. I hope I can find something to do, because this modern lifestyle is driving me crazy.  Screw this, I'm going to play Subspace.  >
