A muscle strain it seems--whatever.  I got a chance to see   urlLink Bringing Out the Dead   again. The first time I saw it was around five years ago when it was fairly new. At the time I didn't know that it was a Martin Scorsese film, but I guess that shouldn't change anything anyway. It's very different, sometimes unsettling, but I like its style. Basically the movie is three nights in the life of a burnt out paramedic who is haunted by the memories of people he was unable to save.  The fact that there is not really a plot supports the fact that the character's life has no direction; it's just an endless series of the horror he witnesses.   Directly after the ending of that movie I went to see the Farrelly brother's newest movie,   urlLink Stuck On You  . It's probably one of my favorite Farrelly movies at this point. I liked the way that they explored the bond of brotherhood and embraced people's disabilities rather than rejecting them. It was, of course, very funny, but also kind-hearted in its approach.
