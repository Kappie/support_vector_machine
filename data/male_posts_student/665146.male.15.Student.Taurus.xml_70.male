'Darkness Falls' is the worst horror film I've seen in my short life, and I've seen both 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'.  To avoid typing because of my poor dexterity, I'll just copy and paste the summary plot from some movie site:   "A young man (Chaney Kley) fears that an evil spirit lurks in his small town taking on the form of the Tooth Fairy, but no one believes him except his childhood girlfriend (Emma Caulfield) and her younger brother, who may turn out to be the spirit’s next victim."   Ok, you know what?  That didn't really work, here's a better one:   "For the past 150 years, the legend of Matilda Dixon, the Tooth Fairy, has hung over the town of Darkness Falls like a dark cloud. After being unjustly accused of a heinous crime, the kindly old woman was savagely slaughtered by a mad rabble one night, and there are those who say her vengeful spirit hovers over the town, just waiting to pounce on anyone who sees her in the dark. It happened to young Kyle. One night he saw Matilda and, though he managed to escape her evil clutches, his mother was brutally murdered. Or was it just a hallucination? Haunted by his painful memories of that night, Kyle has never allowed himself to be in the dark since. One day, he is summoned back to town by his childhood sweetheart Caitlin, whose nine-year-old brother Michael is having the same nightmares that drove Kyle to the brink of madness. When he returns, however Kyle realizes Matilda's evil spirit was no figment of his imagination. She is real and extremely dangerous. And if she catches him in the dark again, her horrible, scarred face will be the last thing he ever sees."   (So far I've barely had to write a thing.  That's what most of this blog is, lots of stolen material pasted and italicized in order to make it look like I've been writing a lot and spend all my thought and dedication here because no one ever reads the dates on these things.  I do this because I can.)  This movie seemed like it had a good plot, it had various quirks that fit with the story and it unraveled in an interesting manner.  However, it, of course, had a lot of problems (said the overly-dramatic teenager standing on a soapbox).  First off, let's start with the sound. It seemed like when we were first learning about the Tooth Fairy entity, it emited different sounds.  The sounds you ask? It resembled if someone had dropped a microphone inside a large, saucy vat of Kraft Mac and stirred at different speeds.  Later in the movie, the Tooth Fairy's screeching was nothing more than stolen tapes of the raptors from Jurassic Park.  Next, the Tooth Fairy itself just seemed like a piñata with talons, covered in ash, and given fighting lessons from Gary Coleman.  (By the way, I'm really getting tired of typing the words "Tooth Fairy" so from here on out, I'm copying and pasting.  Just thought you should know.)  Now, everytime the Tooth Fairy (See?  Copy and paste) attacked anyone, they were, of course, in the dark, and had a flashlight pointing in the wrong direction.  Hence, when she wrestled them to the ground, it resulted in a horrible fight in the dark. Sure, this is necessary for the feelings of panic and fear, but they just went overboard.  They would show a really quick flash, followed by a shot of some veins, claws, blood, more veins, and BAM!  The flashlight hits the camera and the audience goes blind for the rest of the sequence.  Repeat that 2 more times in that sequence alone, and 30 more times throughout the rest of the movie and the seizures just come running wild.  Further gripes will be posted at a later time, until then, here's a preview: Actors - Had no idea what they were doing, very little character development, and no sign of epiphany or help.  They were running blind.
