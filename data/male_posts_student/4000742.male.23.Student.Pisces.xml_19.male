By background, he is a chemical engineer and has done his M.S. and Ph.D. from the US. His complete grasp over the subject shows in the way he goes about his preparation. Although the engineers in the class have studied statistics, probability distributions, etc. earlier, our interest is sustained very well. The professor comes in at the exact time and leaves at the designated time, not a moment of delay or dragging of the class. The slides he has prepared for each class contain excellent animations to make most concepts very easy to grasp. He also makes these slides available through our internal Classroom Online (shortened to 'Claroline') site, so we can download them and go through them to revise the topic. In the 1 hour, he solves peoples' doubts and answers questions, and also solves problems on selected topics   After the mid-term, hopefully we will have him for the Operations Research part of the course too.   And also, he pronounces Tadatmya perfectly.
