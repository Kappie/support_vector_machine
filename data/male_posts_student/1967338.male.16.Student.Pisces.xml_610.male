Marten and Michael are both flagrantly abusing their admin powers because they're mad at each other, because this is childish and immature, I'm taking away said powers.  Do I really have that power? No.  So if any of you think I've judged in error and give the powers back, I will except that I was wrong and let it stand.  If you guys agree with me, then leave their powers off.  I'm not mad at you guys, but when we made the "Everybody's an admin" rule it was not so you could be petty and immature.  And I don't care who started it.   I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....
