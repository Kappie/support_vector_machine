My stomach is growling from hunger!).  I ate cuttlefish with fish slices porridge. O.o My parents ate prawn mee and curry noodles. We shared a plate of carrot cake between us. After eating, we went to the market behind. We brought some  kak , those small little orranges. A pair of them for 80 cents. We brought 5 pairs, so that's $4. Next, we went to AMK Ave 5. There's supposed to be this wet market, but 9it was under renovation, so the vendors moved to this empty space near the building to set up stalls. Yeah. We brought some incense and altar thingys for the family altar. Yeah. Moo meow meow.  After that, we went to Woodlands Central (O.o We are going 'Central' today). They want to go Sheng Shiong to buy stuff. They said they aren't gonna buy much, but hor, they always buy a lot de. Today was no exception. Hmm....we brought more prawns and cuttlefish for steamboat, and crabs for tonight! YaY. We also brought 2 bowls of sharksfin soup (made out of shark cartillage) for me. Ha. After the shopping, we went to eat lunch at the nearby food center.   We came back at 1+. I read the New Paper and watched Dad clean the altar for awhile. After that, I ate sharkfin and came online. Frankly speaking, after eating so much sharkfin, I am getting sick of them. Surprise surprise. HaHa. No way man! I am not gonna eat sharkfin until CNY, when Mom is gonna cook it herself (with REAL sharkfin). HaHa. I went online till dinnetime. There was a short power trip, caused by a fused bulb. Hmp!   Hmm...dinner was some steamed century eggs. Then, I bathed and came out to watch TV (and read my book). Then, tada. I am here. HaHa.  Auntie Linda always sends us a CNY greeting card every year, and we always send them back one. Auntie Linda always spell my brother, Edwin, as Alvin. This year, she managed to get it right. HaHa. For so many years, she actually thought my brother was Alvin, until Mother corrected her last year. HAHA! Well, interesting tidbit for ya.   I am analyzing WQ and his lack of interest in romantic stuff (like appreciating love quotes). Hmm..Due to privacy issues, i cna't post my analysis here. However, friends of his can easily guess la. Yes. It's THAT easy.   I gotta end blogging le. Chilli crabs are waiting for moi (I can smell the rich chilli frangance!! Meow moo!)!! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
