Brittany, her friend Mindy, and I were talking on the phone, and a lot of revelations came to me, including the fact that I was not even sure who the real Brittany was because I kept unintentionally trying to "change" her. I'm not going into all that went wrong because of the privacy of the other two involved, but Brittany and I are okay, and just fine with being friends. I am finally laughing and smiling, and actually innocently flirting with some of my friends that are girls... ML (Mindlessly Laughing.. the Colinism replacement of LOL... I guess the sugarfree version- for the non-hyper) not with guys I hope!!!   Anyway, I'm going to change my  urlLink Unkymoods  now because I am no longer heart-broken. My heart is prepared to move on, and it's finally okay. It will always have a large place that belongs to Brittany, but it's a friend sized portion indefinately, and we're actually okay. I'm finally happy and finally doing good.  Here are the song's lyrics that have been helping me with everything, giving me a way back to the great realtionship God and I used to have and how to get parts of them on MP3 (Also,  Willing to Be Weak  and  To Know Him , also by  urlLink Charles Billingsley  have been good too):     Settle Me Now , Charles Billingsley :  urlLink MP3   I find myself so far ahead of you My minds racing When I think about all I could do for you Anticipating What's beyond the door that leads to tomorrow Oh my heart is weary, and I feel so uneasy  CHORUS Settle me now - Don't let me miss this moment You've got so much to show me And I know, I know I need you Settle me now - Oh Lord please draw me closer Let me feel your presence Reach beyond my doubt and fear somehow Oh, settle me now  So here I am longing to know your will And I keep praying I know you know it's hard to be still But my heart keeps waiting You'd think by now I would've learned to just trust you Oh, but I've been so busy, that's why I'm so uneasy  REPEAT CHORUS  BRIDGE So many times I have appeared to be the strong one When deep inside I wanted to run and hide And Lord I've always looked to you for all the answers But it seems today I've got a fragile faith  REPEAT CHORUS   Anyway, please comment me! Blog ya later! Keep praying! Thanks for all your words of encouragement and love! God bless!  In Christ, Mike >
