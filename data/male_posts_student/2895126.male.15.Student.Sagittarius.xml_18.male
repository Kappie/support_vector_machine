This doesn't sound bad, but here's a blow by blow account:   1) I arrive at work, opened the door to  urlLink Marian Hall , and the fire alarm automatically goes off. (It's so horrible, the sound.) I assume it's a drill; that's happened before.   2)  I sit and find out that there actually was smoke. The alarm panel shows that there's a large amount of smoke above the stage, which is near the elevator.   3)  I find out that the elevator has stopped and that there's someone stuck in it. I say a few  urlLink Hail Marys  (being the religious kind of person I am) and sit and wait until about five  urlLink firetrucks  appear and take an hour to sort things out. I almost die of boredom.   4)  I find that the trapped person is poor Sister Rose, the 90-year-old or so nun who helps me out with dishes and always leaves me a snack. I feel horrible for her, with the smoke, firefighters, and being stuck in an elevator.   5)  I get to work, amidst firefighters and them airing out the elevator shaft. It takes an hour, and I finish at 8:00, an hour past the legal time for me to be there.  I had work today, and it was fine. Everything was back to normal, and Sister was frankly unshaken but told me how horrible it was.  Just thought I'd share.
