'twas a baddd day today..there was actually a soccer matched planned. but we had to cancel it because of some WUSSIES said that the field conditions sucked and Sh*t like that.. i mean peeps...WHAT THE F*ck is wrong with you all?? "don't wanna dirty my soccer boots"- YOU WANNA KEEP IT CLEAN ALL YOUR LIVES!!  moreover, why are you people so POWER-CRAZY. and so "Kiasu".. is this what our background has brought us singaporean children into.. the age where the society degrades till the values of ours are disintergrating.  i'm so tired of the rigid, regimented and seemingly robotic lifestyle i'm leading right now..
