It's got 12 tracks and runs for 40 minutes. She's moved away from  Complicated  and  Sk8er boi  to a new edgier sound that reminds you off  Losing Grip . She's probobly number 1 this week. LOL if she does hit number 1, Usher will be back on top! Ya Usher's  Confessions  is the shiet so don't hate on it.  No song or poem it's just an opinion log.  *Final DaY oF the 3 DaY WeEkeND, WhaT DoeS 2DaY HaVe In StoRe 4 mE?*
