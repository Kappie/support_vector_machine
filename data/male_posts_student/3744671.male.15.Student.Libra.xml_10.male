It's got the typical Tarantino violence that I've come to expect and love from his films, plus comedy, cool stunts, good acting, great writing, everything about this film is good.   The basic story of Kill Bill is about the lead character (called "The Bride") trying to retire from the assassination business, but her boss Bill won't let her, and ends up hiring assassins to kill her and her family at her wedding. However, they don't kill her, only hospitalize her, then Bill shoots her in the head when she's in the hospital which sends her into a coma. When she wakes up, she sets out to Kill Bill like the movie title says.   This movie is the first part in the series, and the second part is coming out soon. There have also been rumours of a third Kill Bill film coming out in a while, but nothing has been confirmed to my knowledge.   If you like action movies, comedys, or Kung-Fu this film will appeal to you, hell even if you don't you'll still apreciate this film. Go check it out.     Rating:  4/5
