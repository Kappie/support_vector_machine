I admire the leftists in this- they are never at the front of storm and they get what they wanted. may be they r true bunch of cowards. They have led to a crash of another 230 points and off gone Rs.50,000 Crore, may be they dont knou hou many zeroes are there in a Crore. I doubt they might know.After all they have been counting the number of " ". They have stalled the Power reforms in the name of "Redistribution of Poverty". I wonder why they should distribute Poverty when that energy can be used to create wealth to all. May be their world view is so negative to even see that. Its time Leftists understand that r else it would be too late for the country.
