I also gave not unconsiderable thought to how capitalist bastards are destroying hippies like myself. Admittedly I have only been a hippy for 3 days, and I don't smoke, or chain myself to trees, and casual sex... well, I just don't get the chance. But anyway, I was thinking about how we could make the insurance cheaper, and I have had the following idea, assisted by my wonderful mother. What we do is: Designate 2 drivers, and I would go for Vicky and Bri, since they are learning to drive even as we speak, but also because they have less insurance to pay because they are female, and also by the time of the trip they should, with care, have a few months of no claims too. Then we get my mum to by the insurance in her name, and nominate Vicky and Bri as drivers. We are not sure if this will work, but it might, and she has lots of no claims. This should lower the price considerably. Then, we divide the cost between everyone concerned, and life is good. After that, I may be able to foot the bill for most of the van, since this years EMA was mostly going to be saved up for a car, and a hippy van is far better. If anyone else, such as Penman actually manages to find a good job and wants to go parts with me, that's cool. Very few people could have thought this far ahead in the space of 2 days, so kudos to me for being obsessed  and  bored. What a long post that was. Apologies to anyone who this doesn't concern and just came here by accident, the rest of the blog is far more interesting, so read that. Cheers.
