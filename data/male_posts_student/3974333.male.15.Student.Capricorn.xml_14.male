I come from the land down under, yes that's right, I'm Australian and damn proud about it. Music is probably the biggest component in my life, I'm single, I'm male (Yes ladies, send your pictures :D), I listen mainly to hard rock and alternative, though sometimes some slower music is kewl aswell. Well I'll stop now cuz I dont know what else to write about so, umm yer, enjoy my gutless rabblings.
