Now, i must warn you...it's like 12:23 right now, so the typos are just begging to come out, i apologize.  anyway, this is how the day turned out...in my last entry, i proclaimed my admiration of the gym by, well, going to it.  Stayed there for about 2 hours.  Now, today was different though.  when one dosn;t go to gym for a while, then does it again, one must re-work back to the same level...well, you see...i hate that.  I couldn't do anything! i felt like such a weakling, aww man, and when i mean weakling, i'm talkin WEAK! well, ya, i got through it though, nothing big...did a 2 mile run on the treadmill...a shit load of lap-pull-downs, sum bicep curls, seded, hammer something somethings, then some other thing....the usual.  and like aways, everyone is always looking at me.  now, i know what your thinking, i must be full of myself right? WRONG. there all looking at me for my elf ear.  ya. thats rights, my elf ear.  for those of you who don't know, my left ear has this, sorta, bump thing ive had since before birth, which, makes me look like an elf....or a   urlLink vulcan.  (except, it's not THAT bad, it's juss like a little bump thing.) anyway, while were on that subject, lemme juss say, i have NO bad feelings for ever having it. sure, during the early parts of my life, i literally wanted to kill myself for having it, it cause me nothing but pain, humility, and overall suffering.  but, what it also did was TEACH me about all those things. it was a blessing. it made me into what i am today.  because of it, i am no longer that SERIOUSLY shy boy i used to be, i love the spotlight, i love the people, i love the bump, it's incredible...anyway, near the end of the gym session, i was obviously tired...so i stopped alittle early and had dinner (trail mix and gatorade) and waited for my dad to come pick me up.  While i was waiting, i juss roamed the gym, having nothing to do...since my muscles were useless.  BUt, on my epic waiting adventure, i got to check out all the ladies...and OH MAN were there alot of ladies.  Usually in the afternoon is when u catch the REALLY nice looking ones, but today, there were a buncha them, and it was like 5 o'clock.  as always, i think some of them are checking me out..what can i say, when i dun have my glasses on, i see alot of thing that PROBABLY aren't real, but what the hell, it's good to dream alittle.  but my dreams completely EXPLODE when i realize i could never be with ANY of these girls...not cause there outa my league (which they are) but because i'm 16...sure some chicks dig that, but no of them know my real age.  it's crazy man.  but, omg, theres that chick gina, OMG, she works right after benny....jesus, she;s amazing.  what i would give to be with that girl....prolly not alot...but still, she's soo hot. pretty nice too. but anyway, ya, thats all my thoughts about that.....maybe i'll rant about my misfortune with girls some other time...maybe the next time i get depressed or something.  well, after that, i came home...it was about 7:00, and i was gonna head over to robs at 7:30.  but, because my dad was pissed, and my lil' bro randy was hungry, i had to wait until 8:10 before i could get there.  well, anyway, i got there, and yea, it was pretty cool.  Rob showed me his newest DVD, and me, him, and hernie discussed the OHS Mole stuff.  After that, we watch the      urlLink Celebrity Mole: Yucatan  finales.  Rob ended up being right on his predictions of the mole,  urlLink Angie Everhart,  and the winner,  urlLink Dennis Rodman.  Good job to him...anyway, after that, we played acouple games of Kareoke Revolution, and thats about it.  Lemme juss tell ya something...Hernedez is a great guy man, love him, but man o man is he full of himself....there, i said it, thats all i wanted to say, hernie, if your reading this, sorry, but thats the way you come off atleast....someone had to say it (or type it) so here it is.  well, ya.  After that, hernie gave me a ride back here, in which on the way, i discribed my hatred towards weed.  anyway, ya, so thats brings me back home.  THere was alot of details i skipped, but thats only cause i want to go to sleep, i have a big day tomarrow.  I'm suppose to be going to the gym again with sabby, my cat comes back from the vet's, we go to jones' for the LAN partay...and i start my HW, due in like 4 days in counting.  So ya, until next time, wtyl....
