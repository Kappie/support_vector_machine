Thursday   I simply hate some people who want to play soccer yet they themselves do not want to take the initiative to just get out of their beds and just come out to play. Don't think it's that much of a hassle isn't it? Asked 10++ people out to play soccer in school...ultimately only 4 turned up(including me). Yeah, it's really pathetic. we played 2v2 and were tired of it just 30 minutes later. It was really exhausting 'cos we were running our heads off in the blistering heat.   Ah well. popped up at coro later and played an hour or warcraft 3(first time in 2 months)..lol. Couldn't help but get thrashed by the professional. hah. Went hien's house to slack, both of us were insistent on watching "breaking news"..but the movie wasn't showing at west mall..so we had to go all the way to west mall. He only wanted to go 'cos Vincent was going since he said watching with another guy was too sian. Took the MRT all the way to orchard...damn...my injured tailbone was hurting even more.   We were late for about 20 minutes..lol..but well..still managed to get 3rd last row seats...and found out that those seats weren't that fantastic after all. The show's really quite captivating, there's non-stop action and a beautiful actress. hahaha..teetered to borders later...vin and hien checked out comics while i trudged towards orchard emerald. En route i inadvertently saw michelle chia(just in case u didn't know she's the actress cum model for lux or sth like that). she was doing some promotion or something along those lines...or perhaps just signing autographs. Didn't have a good glance, but i don't think she's that pretty.hah.  Ah well..had tuition till 10++, really tired after a long day...  I don't think there's anything worth mentioning about Friday...so i'll just give it a miss...   Saturday   I'm sure even a toddler would know when he's playing with fire, right? But well, incidentally a 63-year-old Italian sure has proven his ignorance concerning the matter. Actually i'm not sure bout his exact age..lol..but well..the guy in question is Italian national team manager Giovanni Trapattoni(otherwise known as trap).   Geez. I don't think there's anyone as foolish as him. He's really as dumb as a dodo. Anxiety really built up towards the commencement of the Italian-Swedish encounter, since the Swedes thumped the Bulgarians 5-0 in their opening game. Mr. Francesco Totti was clever enough to clear his throat at a dane, hence i guess u could say it paid dividence. He's banned for three matches. Oh well, turned on the tv and saw del piero and cassano and gattuso giving 101 percent on the playing field. And woah. the italians were playing the best football i've seen in a long time. They put up a prolifically astute performance, defending with outstanding purpose and tenacity, attacking with real aggresiveness and willpower. They were playing free-flowing football, the sweetest a football fan could ever enjoy. hah. I almost woke up everyone when cassano scored...lol..i was exhilarated...going at the top of my voice "hurrah italy!!!"   Italy simply looked to be an impregnable force, with Nesta and Cannavaro marshalling the defence, and probably the best goalkeeper in the world Buffon in between the posts. But well, anything is possible. TRAP took off Gattuso, well i understand that 'cos he was yellow-carded..and he himself wanted to be taken off. But he took off Del Piero and Cassano. Three of the best players for Italy were off! Three other players were on, giving substandard displays of football. My heart was in my mouth when the Italian defence was exposed time after time, subject to intense pressure from the Swedes who seemingly had 4 strikers. This paid dividence. Italy seemed to have lost the drive to go forward, with Vieri still in poor form, and not the most creative midfielders on the pitch. When Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored, i was surprised my jaw didn't drop to the floor. Oh my god.. it was a simply sensational goal...both nesta and cannavaro fell flat on the floor 'cos of previous challenges made, and the ball was in the penalty area bouncing out of control. Suddenly Zlatan just leaped forward and back-flicked it, and the ball flew high into the air, dipping down just beneath the crossbar and above vieri's head into the goal. OUTRAGEOUS. Italians tried to go forward again with the ever-impresive zambrotta, but Isaksson wasn't gonna let anything past him. So it ended 1-1.   Crap. This means that Italy definitely have to win Bulgaria by at least 2 goals, and they have to hope they receive some help from their Scandinavian rivals, Denmark and Sweden, and hope against all hope that somehow they match does not end up a high-scoring draw (2-2 and more). Otherwise all Italian hope of getting further in the tournament will be washed down the drain. With cannavaro, gattuso, zambrotta, and totti all suspended, it will be a tough match, and the bulgarians will not go quietly into the night without getting anything from the tournament.   Geez. Just read soccernet, gattuso defended trapattoni, saying he would have done the same, and he supported the substitutions that he had made. oh god. Are all italians the same? I seriously hope otherwise. However, it's good to hear that Sweden's coach assured the Italians that they'll go all out for the win. Hopefully either Denmark or Sweden emerge victorious and not end up honours even.  Ah well, that's too much rambling for soccer i guess..haha..well..went for pool yesterday with jon...can't believe it. I got the white ball in together with the black ball for 3 times...otherwise i would have thrashed him upside down..urgh...ah well..doesn't matter now anyway.  Dear nephews and niece came over to my place last nite for the last time during their trip, haha...they're darn cute...forever trying to offer food to people..and for some unapparent reason i always seemed to be in favour...haha...but damn..i've got to do some babysitting when i accompany them to "Wild Wild wet" on Monday...crap..i haven't completed my homework yet...  Just gotten news that Germany drew with latvia!!!ahhh!!! luckily i didn't bet with jon..otherwise would have lost 10 bucks...lol...but well i was right that czechs would win netherlands!!! haha...goodbye advocaat and ur dutch team!!
