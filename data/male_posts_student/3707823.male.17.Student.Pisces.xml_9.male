Thank god I'll be working in the evening instead of the middle of the afternoon.   It's funny in Florida you can't sell any fireworks that shoot into the air. The only thing you can sell are sparklers, fountains, and smoke bombs, but people buy a ton of those.   The funny thing is, we have to start selling the fireworks starting on Saterday the 26th through the 4th. No one even comes into the tent the first 2 days. Then more people start to gradualy come in leading to the 4th. But the funny thing is, most of the fireworks are sold on the 4th, in the evening. You would think people would buy most before then but they don't . They all wait until the 4th to buy everything. Also, after people shoot off their stuff on the 4th they come back to buy more so we have to stay at the booth late into the evening. We don't get out of there until about midnight.  One good thing about all of this is that this year I'm suppose to be working with two cute girls.
