Played soccer before NAPFA, then proceeded to the hall, took a piece of result recording slip, which could only contain 8 names, Aaron, Ding Hui and Xuan Ren had to find their own groups. Then we proceeded to the inclined pull-up station, which Hai Gay could not get an A, only B with 25 pulls. Hao Yuan is an exception(you know his weight). I did  30 pulls , then just gave up since already got A.Then we went for sit-ups with Poh Mah See. He was humourous. The only thing was that everybody was trying to sabo Gary...we pushed the back-board nearer to him, his result lousier =X. The only thing shocking was Hao Yuan, with his huge spare tire, he reachedout to about 65cm, with everybody pushing his back actually. Poh Mah See also can be easily cheated, LoLz. I got  52cm(sit and reach)  with my personal record, some amazing A i got. (they also push me a little). We then headed for Mr. Ganesh, where we all were rude to him, esp jia yuan...1st attemp any how jump... So 2nd try i got  215cm(Jump) , just nice for an A. Then OrJiao so funny...225cm also cannot get A, short of 1 cm ONLY.(He is 14yrs). We proceeded to the Shaw Hall for our Shuttle run, after getting a drink from the canteen. We heard from Wei Jing that he got 8.86s. So we all went to that station. I actually fell in the 1st attempt XP. My second attempt was also my personal record, in which i made some stunning  9.42 s.  Jia Yuan also not bad la, he got 8.6s leh...Hao Yuan also got some good result by getting 10.68. We carried on to our final station, the Sit-Ups. Paul Leong penalised Gary for doing wrongly... I did  48 Sit-Ups , then stopped since it was an A, and my jerzy number =Ãž. I went straight home after that and all these ended my happy Day
