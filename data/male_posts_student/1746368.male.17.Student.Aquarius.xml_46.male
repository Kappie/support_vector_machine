I am already getting tired of it, but I can endure it until this semester is over (I change classes around then). Well here is how my day went.  Quiz Time: We had a small quiz in math today. Quite simple, yet I still know I messed up. It was pretty funny, because I finished the homework for the day before he even handed out the test. I than read for the rest of the period. Quite an easy, yet relaxing, day.  Movie Theatre: Well, in english today we did absolutely nothing. It was ok I guess, but I would rather have felt that I accomplished something. We watched "10 Things I Hate About You" and Dominique got upset with me (more on that a little later). I only halfway paid attention since that was about how much I was interested. Only halfway today. I kept on reading the same book as in math.   Social Butterfly: Okay, that was more of one of those names that is really the opposite. You know, like calling a skinny person "fatty" or a tall person "shorty". I pretty much only talked with the regular group for the time. I kind of zoned out a few times. Liam said something about his theory of the end of the world. I pretty much turned it down with my theory of the return of Christ. He said it would take trillions of years for the earth to die. I said it would take only less than a thousand years, with the way we were going (*NOTE* This is only speculation on my part, I don't know when the return of Christ is, and quite frankly only one being in existence does: God). That is when I kind of zoned out. People kept talking, occasionally laughing, and I realized that if God came back now, I would be the only one gone in my group. That is, I hope I would be gone. If God raptures the church, I hope he takes me too. Anyways, that makes my mission even more worth doing. More on that when it actually happens.  Social Butterfly Part 2: This time I was a bit more social. I went to lunch with Dominique, as is now tradition on "B" days (again, 5, 6, 7 and 8th period for all you "Matadors").  I told Dominique what I did in english (Movie Theatre), and she got upset with me since I didn't pay attention. She said it was a good movie. It probably was, but learning about the Rapture was just a bit higher on my priority list. The only reason I got really into the Rapture was because of the books I am reading. I am in book two of the "Left Behind" series. Well, after we were done ordering at Subway (well, after she was done, I just took her drink; I don't like Subway), we went over to Carls Jr. and ate lunch with Grant and his dad. Then we left, and I left them at Granada.   Paying Much Attention?: In Biology I didn't really have to pay attention, she was repeating things I pretty much already knew. I think that I was pretty assured since I was able to finish all the homework without her explaining it. Anyways, yea.  Home Time: Sometimes I wish I lived closer to my school, or maybe even closer to Granada so I could go to Granada, or get home faster. I don't like my school or the positioning of my house (although it makes it convienent to go to CCC [my church]).  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is hotmail. That's where I got my email account. Very nice. I shall be talking with all of you on and off today. I plan on doing a bit of "light" reading. Remember, don't use me as a role model for your daily lives. Make your own path in the walk of life.
