Evidently LGCC helped start BAAYF 10-15 years ago, but pulled out a few years ago over a debate about speaking in tongues, and just re-joined BAAYF this year, making it so that the class of 2005 managed to get through without going to camp. Previous GAVE/LGCC youth "generations" had gone to the camp rather (ahem) religously.  At the leaders meetings Craig and Sharon repeatedly asked us to go, but in general the response was tepid because people had various plans made for the week  They asked all GAVE/LGCC youth members to go, and as far as I can tell the response was also lackluster. Furthermore, Craig specifically called me to ask me to go two days ago, and I said I'd ask my boss about it--I didn't really want to go and I had been more or less saying that I couldn't get off of work when I had never broached the topic to my boss, so in a way Craig called my bluff.  Now that my boss has said that I can go, I'm still deeply ambivalent about going. That's a sophisticated way of saying that I don't want to go.  I like making lists so I'll list the reasons I don't want to go. I'll even write little explanations of the reasons.   1. Hatred of nature-- I have an aversion to camp in general. I dislike pretty much everything about going to camp (different from camping, which I also dislike). I dislike bugs, not sleeping in my own bed, having to share a room with other people, having to share a bathroom with other people, not having the freedom to do whatever I want, and not having a telephone or a television. Usually the water at camp isn't as good as the tap water at home.  More importantly, going to camp is a lot of trouble. I dislikepacking up clothes, towels, and toiletries (this is also why I dislike traveling far away on holiday). I dislike organizing rides and having to be courteous to whomever drives me. If I drive myself, I dislike driving far on my own because my car doesn't have air conditioning or FM radio so it gets boring.    2. Sloth-- I desire to stay at home, go to work, and relax. Maybe it's because I'm an aristocratic, elitist city-slicker, but I like being at home. My house is 2800 square feet and I have my own room, so I have a lot of freedom just being at home. I have a Netflix account, so I can watch a DVD-movie pretty much every day. The refrigerator and pantry always have a lot of good food in them, too (thanks mom).  This probably wouldn't be true if I had a real job, but I like working at Lockheed (LMSAL, actually)--measuring sunspots is pretty easy and I share an office with several other people so there's usually an interesting conversation going on.  In general, staying in Los Altos Hills-Palo Alto during the summer is very appealing to me because it's a comfortable existence--a relaxing one, even.   3. Closed-minded obstinance-- I am a reactionary, and am lazy too. I am a fundamentally conservative person. I'm not conservative in the political sense (soon I will be a card-carrying member of both the ACLU and the Sierra Club), but rather am conservative in my resistance to trying new things. In other words, my default response whenever anyone asks me to do something I haven't done before is the negative. I resisted going to summer camp three years ago; I resisted going to winter retreat until last year; I resisted going to youth group for over a year; I resisted going to the newspaper convention;  By default, I am resisting going to BAAYF.  I touched on this earlier, but the reason I am conservative in this way is that I am fundamentally lazy--it's a lot of trouble to talk to my boss about going to BAAYF, to tell my parents that I'm going, to pack for BAAYF, to write the ($300) check for the fee, c. when I can live perfectly comfortably at home.   4. Greed-- Going to BAAYF would cost me $600. They say that BAAYF costs $300, which is true; the fee is about $300 depending on when one registers. But to a contract worker like me who gets paid by the hour and doesn't get any paid vacation or sick leave, the actual cost of going includes missing a week of work, or about $400, so the total cost of BAAYF for me is upwards of $700. It's actually a little less because of tax and donation to LGCC, but the figure is at least $600.   My reasons for not wanting to go to BAAYF could potentially sound really bad--I don't want to go to spiritual growth and wholesome Christian fellowship camp because of hatred of nature, sloth, closed-minded obstinance, and greed, but I still stand by my reasons. I suppose I could attack BAAYF and Christian camps in general by saying that they promote elitism, don't necessarily promote spiritual growth, and focus too much on fun and not enough on God, but I won't because those statements are as much a charicature of BAAYF as saying that my motivations for not wanting to go are fundamentally based on prejudice, vice, and closed-mindedness.
