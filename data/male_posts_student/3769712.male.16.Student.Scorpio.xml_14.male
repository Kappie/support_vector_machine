The world needs to be(I cant believe that I am going to say this) unified. But yet separated, like if the U.N should take over but of course America kicks ass. This was all inspired by the movie Peacemaker..................hahahaha. LIVE ON "HIPEYS with your PIPES of PEACE". The two best things that came out of the 60's were hipeys and the other is the "Beetles".                                                 P.S. I feel so free man. Like an eagle                                                  man. Feel the wind. Take your clothes                                                  off and be free man, BE FREE(damm                                                  hipeys)
