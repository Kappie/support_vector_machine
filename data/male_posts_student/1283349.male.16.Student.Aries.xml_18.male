As promised, we have part 2 of Caleb and Delebar: The Early Days  So, Young Caleb was hacking it up with the best of them whenever the cons came to town...but he found his hobby somehow lacking. A few cons a year and the odd RPGA meet wasn't enough steak and potatoes for this young Hackaphiliac, no no. What he needed was some good old fashioned weekly meets with a regular group.  An aside: I swear, I'm going to switch back into the 1st person tense sometime, I just slipped into this nasty "Young Master Caleb" business. My bad.  So, he set about to do some rabble rousing. With his proficiency in Diplomacy, he got several of his school buds to join a game with him (damnit, me) as the DM. Everyone gathered round the old kitchen table, got out the polyhedrons, and the hacking began. While I (YES!) was still a green DM, I'd like to think that I gave them a campaign with an excellent Hack Factor. It was my own campaign world, Arboria (They stole it from -me-, I swear), with its own pantheon of Gawds and whatnot. Fun stuff. But the players didn't seem as adamant about gaming as I did, and gradually they drifted away from their trusty dice... and so the first attempt at having a weekly game rotted on the vine. But I continued going to cons, visiting the comic book shop, reading all I could, even doing some meager online gaming. A MUD or two would slake my thirst for a while, but it could never reach the lofty heights of slinging dice.  Then, something extraordinary happened... the hallowed 3rd Edition of Dungeons and Dragons was released! O happy day! O glee! O rapture! It was pretty badass. I gobbled it up during the summer of 2000, and something even more extraordinary happened... the grand, illustrious Brian (*coughKillerDMcough*) started up an old game, converted to 3e of course. Skulls Teeth. The most vicious, tooth and claw, survival of the fittest that was ever dreamed up...in a single dungeon level of the Dwarven Citadel there are more death magics and pit falls and horrifying, mind warping beasties than Gary Gygax can shake a stick at (or a 10 foot pole). He made it into a monthly tournament, and at the time, that was my sole source of hacking. Plus, it was the best hacking...EVER.  I think I have tried nearly every power gaming strategy out in those Sword Kingdoms that was ever conceived. Then, my good pal Joe began to see the light and returned from the shadow of death...Mage Knight. He bought the rulebooks, and seeing what he liked, began to scheme...began to plan...for nearly the most devious (On a scale of one to two, with almost two somewhere in the one and three quarters range) campaign setting EVER... Oceanus, Tropical Paradise, World Under Fire, On The Verge of Archipelago Anarchy.  More later! SUSPENSE!  -Dice Squirrel Lengthiest Squirrel EVER
