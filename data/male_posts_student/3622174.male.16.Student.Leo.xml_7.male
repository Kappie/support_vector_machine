Today's game of the day is Trivial Pursuit on Uproar.  While this one isn't a multiplayer game like Family Feud, it's still a very fun game to play, and very challenging to boot.    While it may not have the looks of Family Feud or other games that I've reviewed so far, Trivial Pursuit still does have a nice interface which is easy to use.  The real winner here is the sound in it.  The sound has never sounded better in any online game that I've ever played.  The music stands out from the rest of the web games, in my opinion.   urlLink    Trivial Pursuit has a nice interface, but too many ads. urlLink     In Trivial Pursuit, the first thing you have to do is pick which game you want to play.  The 5 different modes include "Genius," "Silver Screen," "Music," "TV," and "1980s."  Genius mode is obviously everything put together into one big super game.  Your goal in Trivial Pursuit is to get one of those little triangle piece things for all 6 categories, depending on which game you chose before you started playing.  For instance, I played the TV version, and had categories like "Daytime," "Children's TV," "Drama," and more.  Once you collect all six pieces, you'll move on to the Winning Question.  Answer it correctly, and you'll win the game with a high score.  That score is then converted to iCoins, and you can use those in Uproar's auctions.  Sound cool?  Yeah, it really is.  Now, in regular Trivial Pursuit, the board game, you have to move around a board, if I'm not mistaken.  Well, this online game eliminates that.  You no longer move around a board, and you just answer questions.  In my opinion, if they would have made it a multiplayer game, and also put the board in there, this game would be much better.   urlLink    Finish the game with a high score, unlike me, to get extra iCoins! urlLink     Trivial Pursuit isn't the best game out there, but its an incredibly fun game to play when you get bored.  I give Trivial Pursuit, on Uproar.com, a fair  3.5 out of 5.
