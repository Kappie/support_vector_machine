Partay at my house tomorrow! Woo! I think we need to watch "South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" and "Cannibal: The Musical". It'll make my life complete, cause Terrence and Philip are sweet.  Today at lunch I plan to orchestrate a four person performance of "What Would Brian Boytano Do?". Wish me luck.  Link is sexy. As an adult. Actually I think he becomes like 15. But they call that "Adult Link", what the hey is up with that? Anyways, he grunts whenever he jumps, so I just jump around a lot and wet my pants.  Weekend! How come the shorter the week is, the more unbearable the wait until the weekend is? It's one of those things that you feel like you know the answer to, and then you realize you don't.  What's with everyone wanting comments back? You all see me like every day anyways. And plus, my e-mail and Instant messaging screen names are listed right there. See them? I'm like always online too, remember that.  You all suck.   Naturally I lost the comment war.
