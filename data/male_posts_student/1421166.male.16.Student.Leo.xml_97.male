Sigh...I just don't know what to say about it. I mean, now, my life is just so bland, without all the peace and joy and all. I guess, I'm just spending too much time thinking about myself...and burying myself in activities that attend to my own interest. I even try to seek attention at times...sigh...(I associate myself with seeker not for this reason) I'm self-centered...Music Ministry was into that Others-centered thingy over lunch. I guess it'll be just so great if we never got distracted by our own desires. But because of this, I guess all the more we are dependant on God. Either way, it's best to be God-centered.  Holidays have started. But I wouldn't expect this holidays to be a great one. There's so much homework and band practices. Even if I don't do my work and just enjoy, I won't be able to totally lift that burden. Anyway, I don't have many plans for my holidays. It's like there isn't really anything I want to do, and there's no one to go out with. I just want to spend time with certain people. People I love so dearly and mean so much to me. It's like it is just the presence that matters.  I saw Melissa and Michelle praying together yesterday, and I was like telling Jiashu that it's so sweet. And he told me that I could do that too. And I'm just totally shocked. If I'm not wrong, I only prayed once with one of my sisters personally. At least that's all I remembered. And it was when I accepted Christ into my life. Sigh...just realised that my family so rarely spend time together.  I don't know how to end this entry. Maybe I'll just leave it hanging.
