Well, I'm not using this just to vent--I have a mind into which to vent. No, this shall not give ye shocking things to hear and then to relate. It is possible, however, that you might come to know me a bit. You see, for I am going to publish writings and thoughts of my own on this blog. So...  Transcendence
