That's why I want to do Park marching band first, so I actually know what the heck I'm doing when I go to Chops drill camp. Yeah, so I'm biking for another year. whoohoo!  Speaking of biking...I went out today, and geez that wind is strong. I got up to probably 35 mph on Lincoln going with the wind, which happens to be flat ground. In highest gear, on Napolean (lol, my sister came up with that name for my white bike, so don't ask), with a cadence of like 100 rpms. It was great. Damn stop signs...yeah, they're fun to run too.  I really hope we get severe weather today. We need rain, and I love watching storms...especially when they hit the school. lol. Its getting hazy again, and this morning nothing happened. Stupid storms aren't forming. Oh yeah, and there's tornadoes north west and north east of here, and guess what? WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY!!!!! AND I CAN SEE THE STUPID STORM NORTH OF HERE!!!  Hm...what else did I do today: 1. Went to church 2. Road my bike around town a while, went to Buddy's house and Jamie's house, only to fine neither of them home. Continued on, and found Jamie and Becky up near Cottage Square Mall, and I they convinced me to start chops next year, and to do Park Marching Band this year. So next year I won't be the only rookie-Becky'll be one too...yay, I won't be the only idiot not knowing what they're doing. yeah, no homework, no chores, and no music yet. I'll save that stupid english web quest for tommorow.  I think I'll feature the song that Chops sang last night, and the weather's great today anyhow.  "I see trees of green, red roses too  I see them bloom for me and you  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world   I see skies of blue and clouds of white  The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world   The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  Are also on the faces of people going by  I see friends shakin' hands, sayin' "How do you do?"  They're really saying "I love you"   I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow  They'll learn much more than I'll ever know  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  Yes, I think to myself, what a wonderful world   Oh yeah"  -Louis Armstrong.  Hehe, I can do a pretty good impersonation of him too...
