We got the video from the library and watched it, so we understand it a lot better. And then we started just other bits. Oh, and I typed up my beast of an essay. And... Uh. I watched "Pulp Ficiton" again today. That is like the best movie ever made.   I had McDonalds twice this weekend. Glutton city. I larve it though. Fuck is this a short-ass post. One thing before I click "Publish"...  "Fuck you Lance!"  Classic.
