News (WPFS):  urlLink Cemetery Fight Haunts Some U.S. Soldiers    The most chilling thing I read all day was the last article there. The operations being conducted in such close proximity to the shrine of Imam Ali are risky business. It seems almost inevitable that something is going to happen to the mosque, and supposing it's even moderately serious damage, we'll have a whole new wave of Jihadists on our hands.  Which reminds me of another disturbing point. Moqtada al-Sadr's men are not necessarily "terrorists" or "insurgents" but something entirely different. What the Mahdi Army has become is a symbol of the Iraqi resistance -- by Iraqis,  for  Iraqis. For all the talk of foreign extremists fighting the U.S. troops over there, it seems weird not to take into account the incredible power (particularly in areas such as Najaf, Falluja, and the Sadr City slums of Baghdad) of this kind of movement. We won't be able to merely kill our way out of this; there's a lot of Shi'ites out there and I don't think we're ready for genocide just yet!  ADDENDUM: New violence in Najaf,  urlLink perhaps the big offensive ? Hopefully we'll know more by the morning. Goodnight, world.
