I have my suspiciouns as Daniel and Ryan are both awake when my alarm clock is due to go off.... hmmm  After rushing to school I was nearly suffocated by Chris, Craig, and James because for some bizzare reason they suddenly decided to jump on me!  Anyway, stupidity out the way, the first two lessons were moderately boring, English better than French.  Mrs. Audoiun did a striking performance of the masqued ball scene in Romeo and Juliet with her desktop stationary.  HB Pencil Romeo and HB Pencil Juiliet (also with a rubber on top!) had fun jumping around on the desk whilst a dodgy figure of some cloaked Dracula like thing acted out Capulet.  T'was funny...  Biology was okay.  We had it in Mrs. Bond's room because it's soooo spacious :D  All the way through Shardae kept shouting out... argh!  "MISS SLOWWWW DOWNNNN", "MISS I DONT GET ITTTTTT", "MISS THIS IS CONFUSING MEEE SO MUCH", "CRAIG MOVE UR HEAD GODDDD"... etc.  Geography was hilarious.  Me and Steve had been moved to the opposite side of the room to sit next to none other than Kylie Bridger.  Mehhhhhhh Whatsup Doc'?  A lot frankly.  We discussed our new coursework which involves walking along the A449 and looking at aspects of the area etc.  The lesson was nearly at an end when Mel and Kylie set of a rape alarm!  I'm sorry but what the hell would Mel want one of those for.  It's isn't as if she is going to be raped... lol!  It remided me of one of those annoying car or house alarms that stay on for ages and ages and ages that dig at your head and give you a headache within minutes.  Games wasn't practical (The whole dept. has gone to Wales *sniggers*) so i went along.  We were in Wibbo's class and we drew stuff and I did a bit of English work.  Maths was... Maths basically.  And funnily enough, there was a bit of a rumble in there!  Charlotte was caught with her phone out and Mrs. Lawley demanded it off her but she wouldn't give it her.  She used the excuse that her mum was gonna ring her... oh purrlease!  She went out in a right huff slamming the door and everything as they do.  Mrs. Lawley swiftly following to deal with it.  Everyone went hush to listen to the row further outside lol... t'was funny!
