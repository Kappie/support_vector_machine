"I wouldn't have thought that I'd leave Manchester United. But to be where I am now and to be playing the football I am now and to be happy...I had so many happy years at Manchester United and now I've had a happy six months in Madrid and, I hope, a happy few more years there........ But he's [Michael Owen] a Liverpool player and as long as he's happy there and scoring goals, then he'll stay there."  But is he happy?   that was yesterday, now today. ____________________________  After trying out 'happy', David Beckham reverted to his tried-and-tested favourite 'good' in a post-match interview with Sky Sports on Wednesday night...  "...we played some good football at times. They've got some very skilful players and we've had a good workout. It's another good result really - but the important games come in the summer. We played some good football..."  Good.
