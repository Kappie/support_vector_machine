I don't know how to write the last big question which account for 9 marks out of total 25. I think it will be lucky to get 2 or 3 in the last big question.  Anyway, if you just want to pass the exam, you will feel much better. But if you require yourself to be excellent, that's really hard and really tired. Probably, I should adjust myself and try to be better than myself instead of others.
