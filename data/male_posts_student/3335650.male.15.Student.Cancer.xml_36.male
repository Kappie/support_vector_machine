But luckily, I've got insurance :-) In the end, it wasn't actually needed, 'cos I've got the required TORX 8 screwdriver, and I could fix it...  I got called a mummy's boy today, by a girl in my year, 'cos I had chores n stuff to do and couldn't go skating. Am I a mummy's boy? I don't think so! Seein as it was me who was out tooooo late (btw, i think i might be forgiven *phew*) and it was also me who was "marshmallowed" (it says somewhere in the blogger help to put this instead of ****** to make your blog "mom friendly"), I think mommy's boy's the last thing  anyone  can call me!  Anyways... blog's been a bit quiet today... guess it's 'cos it's sunday, or something... Does any one have any idea how to add a hit counter to this blog? I'm one of those people who like looking at numbers :P Guess that's why I'm doing maths GCSE... Couldn't have anything to do with the fact that it's compulsory could it? I'm also doing french, but I'm nooooo good at it :-( Oh well... if anyone fancies lending me the part of the brain that's responsible for languages I'd be willing to buy you an ice-cream :P Anyway, I'm off to have my bath... See you later!    urlLink The Pencil Case
