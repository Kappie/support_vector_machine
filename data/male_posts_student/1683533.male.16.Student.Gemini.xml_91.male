What is your life rated?    lol, I am as suprised as you are...trust me, it is barely R, like if a couple scenes were deleted my life would be PG-13...  so yea, not much happening...my uncle moved in with us completly which is cool.  He has a PA system and a bunch of guitars.  He is also extremly anti-Bush.  He went to an anti-war thing the other day, and in a couple months he is gonna do some sort of march to DC against the war.  We got to talking politics and guitars and stuff, and it was pretty cool.  Just want this damn week over, and stop snowing agh! lol I opened my sis's car door today and all this snow came on my head :( I wasn't happy.  Oh yea, and I went to Kate's on Tuesday and me and her and her sis and her mom played Scrabble.  It was really fun, and I think I won (I am a Scrabble veteran cause my grandma is like a scrabble junkie and it affected everybody, she knows all the two letter words and shit.  Like "xi" yea, xi is a word, it is a type of sloth.  She is nuts, I tell ya).   Kate was very proud of her add on to my "tan" to spell "satanic" even though it only got 10 points lol.  Good times.  that's all for now.  "I'd never want to see you in the raw and searing flesh." -The Lawrence Arms
