It is a wonderful summer afternoon at Wrigley. Interleague play has just begun.  Bagel has invited me to the game along with Chairman and Sendlak, (whom I just recently saw in court).  Greg Ruthless also has tickets along the first base side right next to the White Sox bullpen with my sinister Uncle Fred(named so for the pencil-thin mustache he has groomed since before there were pencils).  Around the 6th inning, myself and Bagel move down to GR's seats to visit for a half inning, and White Sox reliever Carlos Castillo is warming up in the bullpen.  Bagel begins some good natured heckling, getting a chuckle out of GR.  Castillo responds in no manner to the heckling initially even though Bagel is about 15 feet from him.  Castillo doesn't even look over in Bagel's direction which leads me to believe A)Castillo is deaf   or B)  perhaps Castillo doesn't understand English.  Bagel has now continued the heckling about Castillo's Earned Run Average, (or simply ERA as myself and Mr. Stava would call it), for far too long.  Shouting what is your ERA, CASTILLO, 5.50, What is it Castillo...5.50.  After about the 5th time Bagel asks What is your ERA Castillo, 5.50, Castillo catches the ball back from his bullpen catcher and looks over at Bagel and says........5.50?  That's about what you make an hour, right?    Vintage Bagel.
