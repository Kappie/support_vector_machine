Force gems should  be ruppies but they aren't money so maybe they shouldn't. I always am the HERO OF DARKNESS and its kind of cool that I won a game with that title once. Tingles tower has a new meaning to all you Wind Waker fans out there and its this awesome mini game place. So far we have 2 out of 12 I think and the 2 we have are still really fun and they're suppose to get even better along the way! Hammer Tag as James saw on the web site is the next one and just the name makes it good. Were stuck on Death Mountain level and I think Collin Nik Jeremy and I all hate the bomos medallion part cause "I was trying to protect him!";) part is pure evil and that's only the first level of 3. More coverage on game in future.                                             urlLink
