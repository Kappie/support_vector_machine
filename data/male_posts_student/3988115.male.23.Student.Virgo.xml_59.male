I went over to Kevin's house earlier because he couldn't get his laptop to communicate with his desktop over thenetwork and I'm still puzzled about it, but I couldn't get it to work. Maybe Jason's luck has passed on to Kevin while he's away being ass-kicked at bootcamp.  I'm also still kinda freaked out about the weird French guy trying to kiss my hand at work too.  Check my next post for some crazy library lore...
