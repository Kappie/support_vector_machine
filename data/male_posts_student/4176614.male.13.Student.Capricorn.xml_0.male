In Mid School, a kid's history, however unimportant the details, is brought into daylight and analyzed by cold hearted peers. Compare that to politics. Every vote, every speech, anything the candidate ever  says  is brought to discussion. Just like in Jr. High. The only real difference is that Mid Schoolers haven't voted.  In Middle School, A kid has to watch what he says and does in the present day. If he says anything which can even be misinterpreted in a strange way, he is made into the local idiot, the clown, or a few explicit insults which I wouldn't care to repeat. This blog is from a kid in the trenches, a Jr. Higher who has to go through this brutal torture for about 1/4 of the year.  I know that there is a way out of this: To wait until the roster of winners changes in late High School to early College. But that changes nothing. I still must go through this gauntlet for three more years.  Until another day.
