I have never really had so much bottled up rage towards anyone, maybe it's my desire for independent thinking in all my kids doesn't get through to this guy.  Maybe it's because he doesn't talk about "intelligent" things.  I have Jacob talking to me about TV shows, and his friends.  Then I got Eli talking about his Parents......... I better stop with all this detail.  The thing is, I need a way to deal with this.  So today, I was on the Gnostic sub-forum of the Occult forum and it made me think.  As much as I'd like to use some Thelemic Ritual and upon a Gateway and have him dissappear, I realize that A. I don't have that amount of belief. B. I think it's impossible.  C. Even if it was possible, how many people can actually do that?  So then, the Gnostic thing pops up.  I did this before, I tried to clear my mind and hopefully have my mind deliever me an answer.  Bad idea though!  I swear I heard a voice last time I did that, and I've been pretty scared of doing that since.  Especially because I haven't heard a straight answer, and have been trying to assume it was my psyche talking in some overly Jungian fashion.  So, I may sound like a tottal freak, being a dabbler in the Occult, and actually believing some of this mystic garbage to be real, but I don't know.  I really see a moral problem with turning to the Occult to solve minor problems while others talk about Astral Death, Terrestrial Disturbances and all that good stuff.  So maybe I am insane, maybe it's the fact that I'm tired and stressed because of a brat.  Who knows? Me? "Seek and ye shall find" Maybe I'm afraid to seek? Whatever, I'll sleep and be better in the morning.
