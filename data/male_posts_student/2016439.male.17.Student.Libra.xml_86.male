That you stifle me with your clammy hands and hazy eyes makes me want to run into the house and vomit (that and your dear friend Heat Exhaustion). No amount of water is enough to quell your lust for my sweat, so I have no choice but to hate you for wanting to take my life. Only Winter can overcome you. Winter is my homeboy.
