Memorial Day Weekend begins tomorrow and I hope all of you have a fantastic holiday three day weekend. Be safe. Don't drink and drive, but drink all you can!  To leave you on the eve of this holiday weekend, I give you all an American flag I thought you would all enjoy!     Have a good one, we'll talk to you all real soon!
