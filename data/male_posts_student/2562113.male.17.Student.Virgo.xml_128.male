If all girls were as cool as her there'd be no famine...well, yes there would be but still. Anyway...oh how I wish I had a bigger mouth than I do so I could say somethings that I shouldn't but I can't and I won't but oh how I wish I didn't and could and I don't think I've ever used this many apostrophes ever....going to eat dinner now..."Ciao" as the Italians say ;)
