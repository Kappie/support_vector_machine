It's been a rough couple of weeks, and I honestly don't think things are going to pick up anytime soon. I hate feeling like this. I really do. My head hurts, my mind's in constant disarray, and I'm just physically and emotionally spent. Everyone tells me not to look at my depression as a sign of weakness, since it's a "chemical imbalance"   that's out of my control. But I just can't help but feel as if it's my own fault for feeling this way. I can't help it, I can't control it..but I should be able to, right? It's not fair that I'm unable to control the way I feel, the way I perceive the world around me.. The thought of having to rely on drugs in order to "stabilize" myself for the rest of my life just sickens me. My doctor compared it to people suffering from heart problems. They can't help it, and they too have to rely on meds. But I just don't see the connection. This is my mind we're talking about. This isn't a fucked up heart or thyroid or whatever..this is my fucking mind we're talking about. I should be in control dammit. Chemical imbalance or not, I should be able to dictate how I feel, how I act.. Being a slave to my own mind is so fucking ridiculous. One minute I'm okay, the next I'm feeling like complete shit. I hate this. I really really fucking hate this.       The last few weeks have been one hell of an eye-opening experience. Aside from my oh-so-wonderful stay at Green Oaks, I've been exposed to the harsh realization that concepts such as love and friendship can be so meaningless, so trivial. Never in my life have I ever so desperately needed the love and support of those closest to me. Yet in my darkest hour, the one person who I thought would always be there - who would always love and care for me - turns her back to me. I know I said some things that I shouldn't have, and that I should have expressed my feelings in a more calm and rational manner. But I can't control the way I feel. The emotional outbursts, the sudden breakdowns, the seemingly unrelenting pain..I don't want to feel this way but I can't help it. Why can't you see that? Why can't you understand? I know you're hurting from some of the things I've said, but why can't you just be there for me? No matter how confusing and difficult life gets, you don't turn your back on those you love and care about. You just don't.      Through it all, the lone bright spot (yes, there's actually been a bright spot) has been Grace. I know this hasn't been easy on her, but she's done nothing but love and support me. No one has ever loved or cared for me as much as her, and for that I'm eternally grateful. Without her, I probably wouldn't even be here writing this longass blog. Yea I know I bitch about not being able to see her as often as I'd like, but I really am thankful for every second I get to spend with her. God I love her. We recently had our first baby. Not a real baby of course, but a six-month-old kitten we adopted from the SPCA. The kitty formerly known as Benita (no offense if your name is Benita, but what the fuck kind of name for a kitten is Benita?), is now the super-hyper, oh-so-curious, sometimes naughty sometimes nice Bitsy. Betsy thinks she's named after her, but nahh I just thought Bitsy sounded cute. I tried to snap a few pics of her but I swear she has ADD. I managed to get a couple decent ones after a few dozen attempts. I'll post them up when I get around to it.      What else..hmm well my hard drive fucking took a shit yesterday, forcing me to waste even more money buying a replacement, I've been sitting on my ass chatting with vpatel and Jon all day long, I've actually stuck to a somewhat consistent workout schedule this week, my diet's been complete shit (fried chicken and indian food..I'm such a fucking pig), Betsy's in New York, I still haven't started studying for either micro or genetics, I tried ginger ale for the first time ever and actually liked it, laughed my ass off watching Harold and Kumar, had my fortune told by a freaky romanian tarot card reader at Grace's friend's party last weekend (seriously freaky shit), endured hours of mindnumbing karaoke in addition to overpriced food at Tay's party, discovered my garage door is fucked up, and uhmm did I mention eating? Ok, Grace should be here any second with some kfc (seriously) so that's it for now.
