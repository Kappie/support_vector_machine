       
      Here, during my weakest hour, I grow fearful with the idea that the feline beside me will grow hostile against me. For the reason that I am pulling his moderate lengthed, black furred tail. I grow weary with each several minute.   The time as of now is a quarter to four AM. Viewing my brother constantly watch his rerun apon rerun of  Seinfeld , and notice him blindly stare into the seperate computer reading up on  Comunist Manifesto , and literature based upon national socialism is painful. Though, his opinions grow stronger, more sensible, and more against the topic, it still concerns me when those various subjects arise in our day by day conversations.  The night grows dim, so I debate with my wondering mind if I should remain in my constant state. Which now and always consists of roaming through various forums and web sites. Or shall I retire to the couch nearly three steps away, that my trust worthy St. Bernard lies upon.   I believe I shall regain my strenght. Tommorow shall be a long, pain stricken day.  Farewell...
