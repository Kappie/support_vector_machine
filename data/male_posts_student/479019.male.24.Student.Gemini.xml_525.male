I fucked up a batch of dough today... eye balling ingredients when you're exhausted and hungry isn't a good idea...  -Work went by really fast today.  -I did a little bit of writing, but not enough.  -I need to return 2 books tomorrow.  -Need to pay the library a visit between noon and 5 PM  -People who dig art are cool, especially if they know their shit. Some people like art, because of the cultural capital of liking art. But, you should like things because you actually like it and not because it makes you look smart. So when I meet someone who knows their shit, I'm impressed. That's not saying I'm an expert on anything though.  -I dwell and worry about things I shouldn't... it's my obssessive compulsive side.  -Stephanie still owes me $13.  - I should be less lazy.  -The Dropkick Murphy's  Blackout  is a great album. I've been listening to it a lot lately. "Bastards of Parade" is perhaps my favorite song right now.  -Binghamton, NY seems like a distant memory.  -I want to see another show.  ***
