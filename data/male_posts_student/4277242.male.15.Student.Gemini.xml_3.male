It wasn't a nice surprise.      Ages of experience dissolved into layers of sedimentary wealth of my mind told me. When you saw those two people at the same time, you usually don't get to talk. (Most of the time, they talk) We are under one roof, in two different bubbles: Me in my own, them in theirs. Homework suddenly takes up a large part of my concenteration. (That or whatever book I am holding when the demonic self-enclosement strikes.) The day passes as hand and brain make painstaking progress through the maths assignment. Geesz. I hate linear laws.      So that was the title.      The first pingpong event today is painful to watch. Li lost! If not for everyone's animal desires (i.e. to eat), we would have fasted for three days. Where nationalism is least expected, it comes and knocks everyone off their chairs; Julie begins to hate Koreans! Ah all the stories about her tearing up the pic of Kim into little pieces and crying whole night...      The worst was not over   until I got insomnia and did not sleep until 5 in the morning.
