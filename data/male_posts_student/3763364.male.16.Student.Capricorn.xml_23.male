I'll probably post again in another hour, but hey, a chance is a chance, right.  I chance is a chance...Can I throw away my chance?   Whatever.   I've been thinking about college. I've been thinking about the future. OK, so college is in a year or so. I'm going to major is psychology, minor in philosophy or somethingorother. The required admission average is 81% percent right now at the U of C. I want to go to the U of C. If I do, I can live here at home and save thousands. The admission average will probably rise and rise. I will need to achieve academic excellence to attain my goal. Right now my average is in the mid-70s. I've got some work to do. If I fail, I won't get into university, I won't get a career. I figure I'll just go on a killing spree if that happens. For now, we'll call that plan b.   I hear a lot of university students change their majors at least one throughout the course of post-secondary. I fear I may suffer the same fate. Do I really know what I want to be right now? Right now? Right now? Right now? Fuck. My future isn't going to go as planned. Not one bit. I know it.    I wanna meet some people! I wanna expand my horizons! I wanna have a number of friends that extends into the double digit range! I wanna have someone to turn to if I need it!   Haha, funny thing, damn near everyone on hear is chinese or japanese or spanish or whatever. I need somebody that speaks english! ENGLISH! I WANNA MEET SOME WHITE FOLKS! Haha, just kidding about the white thing, but some people that speak the same language as me would be nice.   And what about the fucking lingo in this place.   Hey pplz, so mee an mah homz went 2 da mall 2day, dat wuz whack. neways, mah bf an I r havin sum truble. I dun kno wat 2 do. do i talk 2 him? I jus dun kno wat 2 do.   or   WTF, ROFL, LMAO, LOL. LOL. LOL!!!! Laugh out friggin loud!   There. How can they get their there's confused? The desecration of the english language that occurs on the internet is unruly. I crave some intellectuals to talk with. Ones that can spell. Ones that take time to think about what is coming out of their mouths.   I guess that's the obsessive compulsive in me.     I'm going off my rocker.  I saw her sitting on my couch today. She's three thousand miles away and I saw her sitting on my couch. I walked up to her. I smelled her hair. I touched her face. She didn't say a word. I turned away and she dissapeared.   That seems to be the way it is with most anything.  At what point does like turn to love? At what point does love become obsession?  Arielle. I think of you all day. You swim in my blood now. I must have you, Love.
