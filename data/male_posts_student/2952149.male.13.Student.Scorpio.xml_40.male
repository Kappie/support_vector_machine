On the way to third period this kid had a big Ziploc bag and he ripped it down the side and (with my sick imagination and all) it kinda looked like a Klan hood. So I took it and I drew eye holes in it and it lookes awesome lol. In third period I found out that both me and Jon got perfect scores on our DRPs! I was like so happy cuz for a sec I actually felt kinda.....smart. So nothing else really happened....everyone was pretty happy for the most part and I realized how much I am gonna miss being with all of my friends and pissin off the teachers. And Stacey, for the last time I wasn't having an orgasm! lmao (dont ask). So today I was in the car and I told my parents a racist joke and my mom was like "Ryan, you don't really mean these things when you say them right? You are just kidding?" I was like "Um...yeah...sure mom..." My dad who unkowingly taught me the tools of the trade was lookin at her like wtf are u talkin about lol. I didn't wanna say nothin cuz then she would just start sayin how tim is a bad influence on me and alla this other shit when he has nothin to do with it...so I kept my big mouth shut for once lol.
