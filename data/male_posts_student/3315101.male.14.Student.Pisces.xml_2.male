It was fun i guess u can say.   walked up a isle, got some sort of papper i could use for the fireplace, walked down the isle, done.   Only one besides Ben that was completely dressed up.   Kinda made me feel/look older by another 10 years (cause i feel like i'm 23 already).   After that i got bored/depressed and spent the rest of the after time in the car with top down and music blasting.   9 years of school on a mountain with an ocean view wasted, now a whole new lifestyle will errupt.  Now I'm with the big kids, screw all the people I can talk to after school, now its like walking through costco just that all the shoppers are jocks and sluts.    After that we went to Double D's, best sports bar grill evar!  Coming down the hill was....hmmm.    I saw like 5 people from my school on the highway all going to dinner.   3 on the freeway, 1 came onto the same street as us, and i saw another walking on the sidewalk.   Sure thats what highskools gonna be like, but we haven't even entered it yet.  back to the restrant.  We watched the Lakers game...though i was like the only lakers fan there, everyone else was a Pistons.  Though my mom's friend wanted those cussion seats instead of a chair, so we switched tables.   I was like WTF, we are right in front of the bigass screen tv and you want to trade to a 20'x16'???   Then she and my mom drank a few beers wich threw this thing all down hill (i dont mind it, but when you gotta drive your children, stay off the fucking beer).   After that we were goingt to get a game but her friend saw one of her friends and went talking to her untill about 15 minutes before that store closes.    So we had to go speeding down the highway to that store (remember the beer).   We made it just before they closed, i mean just before, they were at the door locking it when we came.  Got the game, yippee.   But still, kinda pissed me off cause whenever my mom brings her friend, she try's to include us (me and my brother) but then...she tries.   Come to graduation, please, but dont forget, its my day, my dinner, my fucking bigass screen tv.  Well i've been playing that game all day, pretty fun, computer kinda sux with it tho.   Now i dunno what to do.   perhaps sleep, tomorrow is a bday party.  After that i'll see no1 until weight training.     btw, i'm staying.  no highskool in florida.
