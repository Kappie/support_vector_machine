Fuck the fact no-one's going to read it, Sam's not going to know about it, fuck everything (not literally) I want to let the soul of the internet know how I'm feeling. For Christ's sake. All I want is to get it out.  Somehow I miss her like FUCK ALL ELSE. Part of the feeling I believe will be drowned tomorrow, to come back one time in the near future. I love her. Screw everything. Get that out and I can live for another damned night. Why is it so arsing hard to accept this...
