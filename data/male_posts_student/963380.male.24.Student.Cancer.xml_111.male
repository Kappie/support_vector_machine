Next Gen had an altogether different feel - thank you Jeff for convincing me to buy something I simply wouldn't have otherwise.  Ever start to feel a little out of place and realize that it really is something or someone you miss? That sucks.  On the upside I'm spending more time with the rents. That's pretty highend. Dad and I are looking at getting bikes after we take our test. I'm thinking a Suzuki 650. I was thinking of a 250 - but apparently it's just not enough to get me around.  I've had some bizarre dreams of late. I don't think I've woken up in the last week and understood where I was or what was going on for a good minute or so. It's rather discomforting. A rebellious brain simply isn't kosher. I glance at my desk and see bottles for apple juice, cans for iced tea, a plate for pasta, some luncheon meat wrappers and some husks of some peanut butter cups. All consumed before bed. Perhaps this is not the best sort of snack. Water and fruit before bed from now on. Also, clean this mess the fuck up. Christ. Cesspit does not begin to describe the mess that is my desk.  Work has been... well... interesting for the past few days. My boss is about to become a dad - I think he's like 26 or 27. They induced his wi... er... girl fri... er... I think they've married.... I'm not sure yet though. But they induced her today. As much as Steve can be a bit of a jerk from time to time, he's a good guy, so I hope things turn out well for him. I took Thursday off and spent it with my dad. It was productive and fun. Plus we looked at motorbikes and god damn, they're cool.  The weather is finally lightening up (I love when people refer to the natural electrical phenomenon as "lightening") - it was actually *warm* today. Not californian warm, Canadians in shorts warm. So about five degrees.  We're a rather fucked up people.
