Even though I grieved weeks before I became single there is still a lot to get used to, a lot of things I miss. michelle broke it off with Kyle, for that I am proud of her, it wasn't an easy thing for her to do. At least she has someone to comfort her. Moving on takes time... I can only wonder if we'll remain friends. I certaintly hope so, michelle is my best friend, that's a lot to loose. She alone knows things about me no other soul on this world has ever heard.  There shall be others, I can only hope... that statement doesn't bring much comfort right now. I can only wait until I am ready to chase that rising sun once more.
