On the way into town he saw a group of people carrying two bed sheets which read, “You give us 10 minutes, we’ll give you eight years.” He asked the engineer to stop the train and then gave an impromptu fifteen minute speech to the delight of the assembled crowd.  Starting to love this man more and more every day...   Not a whole lot has been going on lately.. soooooo... alas, not much posting.  ~ George
