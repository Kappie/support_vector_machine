I watched One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time last night with Heish. Heish was super-pissed with Nurse Rachett, reminded me of my reaction the first time I saw it. God Damn! What a great movie that is. It's got to be the best movie I've ever seen, at least my favorite now. I'm listening to The Beatles now. I think it's hilarious how within the last year they've gone from the band I HATED the most to probably my favorite band. I think I just finally get them now. I used to be such a dick, thinking that there was actually  good  and  bad  music, and the only music that was  good  was music that exhibited supreme instrumental proficience (which at the time, to me, meant speed and complexity). Lennon and Harrison weren't shredders, McCartney didn't write fugues, and Ringo didn't play like Max Roach, but I'll be damned if that means they're not a fantastic group. ok... gotta pick up Kris  NP: The Beatles - The White Album  Big Country - In a Big Country (mmmm. NewWave-Rock) Downloading some Elton John
