Nevertheless, I  had a great time really.. nothing more to say on that matter.  I  want to learn how to program in c#, I really do, I did a basic program  just for practice saying "hello world". Now that I'm back home I don't  know what to do, I'm making legs for my "Gai sensei" pic but i can't  draw his feet :,/. Tomorrow's the 18'th, or well, its past 12pm so its  technically the 18'th, and my girlfriend comes home in 10 days.   I'm still taking situps each night, i don't want to rot here, I  figured, I'm always so inactive i have to do something to keep myself  from getting too fat. I watched 3 top gear episodes today, which all  rocked(I mean, duh, of course they did..). I haven't really done  anything today, besides gotten up at 3 pm,  had my mom come pic me  and my computer up from the lan, taken a shower, and relaxed. I guess I  should finish "Gai sensei"s feet before i go to bed..
