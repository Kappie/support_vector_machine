As usual, WenJun reformatted the com, deleting the whole of C Drive, which had my Diablo II saved game!!! I had just gotten my Iron golem! And my Civilization III!!! I just discovered OIL!!!  Secondly, the first victory is that WenJun installed WIndows Professional, as i had lent the Windows XP cd to Chee Hong... And now we also have Office 2003.  Thirdly, as i have predicted, Owen will score, because i am Owen. And Portugal will win Euro 2004, noone can stop them. Owen did well, but if i were there with Owen, we would have won it.  That's all i'll write today.  Chee Hong, bring my cd on Sunday! Zhi Yang bring my Diablo II Cd on Sunday!
