The hardest thing I believe we do as humans is admitting to ourselves that we have real problems and faults, and accepting our faults and other's faults. We put up so many defense mechanisms, rationalize so many things, and go to extreme lengths just to have a reason not to admit to yourself your problems, mistakes, or faults.  And then accept them.  And accepting them is the hardest part. I can easily name out many of my faults, but accepting them and working through them is the hardest of all. We so easily Judge others constantly to make us feel better about our faults.  Constantly.  For us as human beings, its impossible not to.. Its in our nature, but once you let those judgments become either apart of you, your life, and your  actions  is where the trouble begins. I've come to affirm to myself to try extremely hard not to judge others because I've realized so much that  You can never really understand ANYTHING until you experience it for yourself.  Again for I believe this is emphatically important, You can never really understand ANYTHING until you experience it for yourself. You can never really know about something until you feel it. Until you've felt what they've gone through.. Until every being of your soul cries out to that person for their hardship whatever it may be... Whether they're going through that hardship now, have, or will. For me, some very important events deeply altering my view on life or not life I should say made me come to realize this, and I feel this will be the same for anybody reading this.  For this statement in itself is Rhetorical.  What I mean is, you can't even TRULY understand this statement, until some life altering event makes you see it so, but maybe this'll help, or maybe its just my rantings. So as I've said before, in truly understanding this, I've affirmed to try as I might to not judge others, but what do You the reader care? For we only truly want whets best for ourselves eh? So then, I leave you tonight with a charge to though you may not understand or care what I'm talking about, Keep it in the back of your mind that the unkown is there. That you Don't know what other people have gone or are going to go through, so be nice to them. It may make all or part of the difference as it did mine.  ~CQ
