RBG is cool even without me sporting it.  School was pretty cool today, I held myself together pretty well, considering I had lost my lab, but I figured it was in my locker, and yes, good lord, it was.  I tried out for FNL yesterday.  I think it went pretty well, being a minority automatically makes me more funny then Seinfield I guess, but that's not exactly saying a helluva lot.  It was really fun though, I really do hope I got in, but as has been proven worrying proves nothing.  I will either get in or will not get in, either way is what is supposed to happen and since I don't have any control of the situation, I'll be glad with either one.  Haha, Cop Shot just came onto my song list.  I'm gonna post the lyrics, it's so funny, yet so addictive to listen to.
