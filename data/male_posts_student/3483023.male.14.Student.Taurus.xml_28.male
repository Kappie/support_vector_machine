I Really Needed To Clean The Bathroom, It Has Needed To Be Cleaned For Like The Past 4 Months, LOL, It Is Clean Now... That Is All That Matters! I 'Tried' To Play With Silver, But He Keeps Biting Me For Some Reason, I Think I Pissed Him Off! Earlier I Watched Last Years Brickyard 400 (Nascar Race), I Watched It Because My Favorite Driver (Kevin Harvick) Won That Race, And When You Know Your Driver Is Going To Win A Race (ReRun Or Not) You Just Can't Stop Watching The Race! Know I Am Watching Last Weekends Race At Pocono (Nascar Race), I Know Jimmie Johnson Is Going To Win, But I Missed The Beginning  End Of The Race, So I Am ReWatching It! I Think Studio 7 Comes On Tonight, Yeah! I Know Alot Of People Said That 'Studio 7' (Show On TheWB) Was Stupid And Probably Scripted, I Actually Really Liked The Show And LOVED The Trivia! Its Nice Watching A Trivia Game Where You Know Some Of The Answers! Ok, I Might Post Another Entry Later In The Day If I Do Something Else, GoodBye World!
