Today I had to tear down a tree, then mow lawn. I got the tree down easy...it wasn't too big. Then Jadie and I started to mow lawn. We got one part done when I decided, hey lets go inside, so we did.  We made a very drawn out attempt to put an air conditioner into a window (since we dont have central air). That went great. It should have taken about 20 minutes tops...it took almost an hour. Then I had to fix the squirrel cage fan, that went great. I couldn't find the stupid right size socket. Then I got it done...after getting mad over stupid things.  THEN, I had to go with my dad to change a tire on a hay rack (with the hay still on it). He was taking it somewhere and the tire ran out of air (just sorta deflated). We had to jack it up and put a new tire on. That took a few "hail Mary's" but we got it done. I let down the jack and saw the tire was low...but didn't say anything. We got it to its destination...then it exploded...so my dad got very pissed...  We got home and had to go bail some more hay, about a mile and half away...so I drove the tractor with the hay bailer along the high way. Some asshole (pardon the language) thought it would be funny to SPIT ON ME! So that made me happy...not.  I tell you...people suck!
