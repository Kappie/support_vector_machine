I'm not proud of what I did to receive them." -John Kerry, who now claims the experience he gained from four months of combat duty in Vietnam qualifies him to be President of the United States.  "I'm a Christian. I've read the Bible and I know you can find the clauses that go both ways (on gay marriage)." He's wrong about two things here, 1. He's not a Christian 2. The Bible is 100% against gay marriage.  Kerry says that we shouldn't depend on gas in the Middle East, yet he is opposed to drilling in Alaska.  "We need to disarm Saddam Hussein." Only smart thing he has ever said in his life. But he now goes against his earlier belief.  Vote Senator Flip-Flop Even Democrats know that John Kerry is a world-class two-faced, flip-flopping dope.
