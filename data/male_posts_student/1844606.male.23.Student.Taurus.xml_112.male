With that said, as soon as I could after shaving, I donned a black turtleneck and preened in the mirror, exacting my BC like moves to perfection.  Its striking how much I can immitate that man-and how glaring a white head is on a black turtleneck.  Before the 'hawk went away, it was captured (hopefully) in its full majesty on film-rocking out.  All I can say is that it involved rock poses, candlelight and simulated sacrafice.    Later my roommie and I got the brilliant idea to take pictures with me and various records.  It went like this:  -Black sabbath behind, me contemplating Ride the Lightning  -Miles Davis behind me as I read Kerouac  And the stopper  -Lets Get it on while "reading" my human sexuality text.  The bald pics are priceless as well because I make fun of BC.  I won't say how, you'll just have to see.  Maybe I can scan the things, find a way to post them.  I don't know, might be a lot of work, but worth it.
