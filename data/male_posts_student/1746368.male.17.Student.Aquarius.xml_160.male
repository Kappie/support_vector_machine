My fingers (well, finger) already hurt to begin with, and now my palms are all scratched up and the skin on my hand is peeling. Fun!  I went over there at around 10 in the AM and I started playing Risk with Chris, but then his friend came over and Chris kinda desereted me. So when we finished the game, I returned the favor by wiping him out.  There isn't really anything to do right now, so I think that I am just going to try and find Castle Risk on the internet. Yeah, that'd be great...well, that's all for now. New  urlLink  SB e-mail!
