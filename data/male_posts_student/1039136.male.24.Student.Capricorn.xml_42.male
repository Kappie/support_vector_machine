After reading Radio Matt's away message, I found it amusing that Bam Bam Bigelow would open an ice cream parlor in NEPA..I figured it was some kind of joke. Somehow though, I crossed that thought, with another thought. A few weeks ago I was at tinks on a saturday, which by the way will forever be known as DRAMAday, and someone said to me that Bam Bam Bigelow was there. Finally tonight I read my cousin Pat's away message and it said something about going to Bam Bam's. I decided to hit google up some info, and in return I got several articles revealing that Bam Bam Bigelow, the beast from the east, Dirty asbury park NJ native, has, In fact, opened an ice cream stand in Hamlin,PA appropriately called Bam Bam's. To steal Radio Matt's heat,I wonder why he didn't call it Greetings from raspberry park.  Now..makes me wonder, was he at tinks?  I think if I saw him in person, I would call him a flamer..he has tattoos of flames on his head, but in his drunken state, he may punch me, and then..i would sue and take over the Bigelow family fortune and Ice cream parlor.   My life has been pretty calm this summer...it's almost disappointing. It's just my life taking its usual course though. It's an incessant waves of ups and downs...or calms and storms.. Right now..i'm in the calm on the rise..which is rockin. I've been getting bored lately, which isnt usual for me. In one months time though..school starts again..my official last year..its gonna be one hell of a storm.  The highlight of this weeks social calendar is Volch's 1-week late birthday bash...i'm making the jello shots..should be a blast.  Work has been crazy lately, and alot has been stressin me about it. This is for two main reasons. One is because the future of the company is basically on my shoulders and second, the play and the work don't balance out right now. I try to keep things in balance in life overall, like the ying yang symbol. Chaos in ones life is caused by an imbalance of one thing over another.It seems i'm working too hard and not havin enough fun on the weekends to compensate..its really paying a toll on me. Lately i've been overly edgy, especially when i drink..i'm always tired..i'm just beat overall.  Speaking of the upswing pattern, I gota cell phone, which is awesome. I won't have to send carrier pidgeons now to contact someone. So call or text me :)  I'm not even sure what to expect for this last school year. Everything I expected the previous 2 years turned out completely different. I'm just going into this one without any guesses, just my balls and alot of beer, and i'm ready to tear shit up.  On another subject..this has been my first single summer. I can't say I miss the aggravation of having a g.f, but there are other little things that I miss, like everyone. Maybe this will be the year that I find love, and maybe it won't be..who knows?  I think this post is lacking because i'm lacking anything entertaining to write about..so i'm just gonna bounce.  Peace, Love, and lots of wild and crazy sex. ~Oz
