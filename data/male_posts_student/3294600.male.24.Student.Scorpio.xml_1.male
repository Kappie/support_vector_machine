Jackie and I figured it would be a trick test with some stuff to read carefully before.  She had given us strong hints it was one of those read everything before you begin type tests.  Well the joke was on Ilona because she forgot to print the last page with more questions and the "Don't answer questions....if you already have it's too late."  It was funny.  I think I did alright on the test, but will have to wait until Wednesday to find out.  I worked in the computer lab most of the day on batch files for class next week.  Unfortunately, I'm having problem getting the day thing to work now that I'm not in the Windows 2000 OS.  I'm going to spend a lot of time on it Tuesday since I have 2/3 classes.  I'll just go normal time to work on the batch file in the lab.  Dale met someone last night after dinner.  I guess they went and had coffee and hung out.  I'm glad to hear they hit it off well.  He's still going after the early 20's.  This guy is into older guys though, we'll see.  I stayed home and worked on homework and packing.  God I have so much of both to do.  I have a little room on homework and need to focus on moving, but really want to get the homework done as well.  GRRRRRRR!  Today (Friday), I got up and worked on my English paper and got it done about 12:10 and rushed to get ready so I could deliver it to Holly by 12:50.  The rain was horrible on the way and seems to be worst here in Smokey Point...weird eh?  I got it to her and talked for a few minutes.  She reassured me everything for class would work out.  It was helpful to hear, but doesn't make it any easier.  It felt good to get the paper done.  After I left talking with Holly I went to the Post Office Box and picked up "my mail."  I say, "my mail" because I have yet to receive anything for ME at that address, it's all been for my Dad.  That's fine I guess.  I'm going to need to start using it more after Monday since I don't really have an address after then.  I'm still going to be friends with Dale of course so there is no problem getting mail after school or whatever.  I went to Mexican for lunch here in Smokey Point.  It was super yummy, but lonely since it was just me.  There were other tables, but nothing interesting to eaves drop on.  What do I expect for Smokey Point?  After lunch I went to get boxes to move and they told me at the licquor store there are none and to check back on Tuesday's.  I was like, that does me no good.  So I don't know what I'm going to do about boxes.  I wish Dale would have gone like I had asked him to.  I also hope he's going to bring boxes from his store tonight like he said he would.  So packing and homework will be my Memorial Day celebration.  Joe wants me to come over and have BBQ with them on Monday afternoon/evening, but we'll see.  I'm living life on the seat of my pants right now and quite frankly the road burn is a pain on my ass.  If anyone knows of affordable apartments in the Marysville/Everett area, please let me know! :)  Hell, my luck I'll be hit by one of those funnel clouds or whatever spotted all over Everett, Snohomish, and Mount Vernon today.  Later!  Jason
