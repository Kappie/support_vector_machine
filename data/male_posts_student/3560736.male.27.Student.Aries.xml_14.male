It seems like he's tired of it and has simply had enough. And I can't really blame him. The constant attacks from the opposing party and from the press would be enough to wear anyone down.   In fact, I'm a bit surprised that anyone would want to get into politics on a national stage in any form. The constant criticism by one side or the other, the constant need to defend/attack - it just seems all so constant and petty. I don't care if you're a democrat, republican, libertarian, green, independent or whatever - you have to have some seriously thick skin to be able to hack it on the national stage, and a healthy ego.  The worst part of it all? It's only going to get worse from here. Baring a revolutionary and dramatic turn-around in the political zeitgeist things are only going to get more and more partisan for at least the foreseeable future.   UPDATE:  Jeff Jarvis seems to be thinking the same thing, but he has yet another perspective that is really  urlLink quite ironic in context .
