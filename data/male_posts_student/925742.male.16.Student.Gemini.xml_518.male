Which is acutally quite a good escape.  I have the HL2 beta, and its nothing to get sticky pants over.  Its nice, but buggy, as I may have said before.  Now Adam has ut2004 and we're probably gonna keep playing till he gets good.  Thats gonna take a bit.  Gimme gimme gimme.   I want some more.  Gimme gimme gimme.  Don't ask what for.
