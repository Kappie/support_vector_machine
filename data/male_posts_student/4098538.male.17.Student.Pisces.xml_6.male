So we were walking around town looking for an open cinema but we didn't find any. So we ended up buying two10 packs of Fosters and going back to my house. I got just a bit drunk but we had a really nice night! I miss her now. I never thought she would show any kind of interest... shows what I know. Anyway, today is Christmas day! Hangovers on Christmas day suck. My little brother woke me up at about 8.00am. To be honest I wasn't expecting too much. I got some nice stuff really. A really cool digital camera (which I was gonna buy with Christmas money anyway!), about Â£130 (upto now!), loads of art equipment, some gift vouchers, a wallet and some other random useful things! Not bad really! Just finished Christmas lunch and I can't breathe due to stuffedness. I'm gonna sign off now. Merry Christmas!
