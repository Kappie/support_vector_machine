I really miss her. I wish I could spend more time with her. Anyway, she had her University interview today! I hope she got in! She'll be so upset if she doesn't. I can't wait until next week. Mandy told me she wants to stay here for a few days to make up for the lack of seeing her this week, so that's gonna be amazing! Wow, my dad just said he likes Sublime. Aw yeah. Anyway, if you're reading this Mandy, I love you! xx
