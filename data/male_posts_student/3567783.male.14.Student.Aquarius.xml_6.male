I wonder if there is anyone in this world that will go through dangers and risking their lives just to get the one thing they love.  Watched School of Rock a few days back, and American Pie. School of Rock is fun, especially all the music in it ^_^  American Pie, however, is full of sexual stuff (there's even a topless scene involving Shannon Elizabeth). It's about 4 guys making a pact to get laid before school prom's over. I tried watching American Pie 2, but the PS2 region lock made me can't do it -.- Hilarious comedy, anyways :D  Went back to kampung this morning to get my hair cut before the school starts. Meh, school sucks =.=
