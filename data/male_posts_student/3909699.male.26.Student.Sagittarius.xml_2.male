I feel pretty secure here - more secure than I've felt in a long time, and, I know, a lot more secure than I'm going to feel for a long time to come. So i think i'm going to stay one more day, one more day than I wanted. I'm just so bloody tired. Seeing old people from school (foreigners, read 'high school') over the last couple of days, people I haven't seen for anything from two-and-a-half to four years, was pretty uneventful. Things were the same as they were eight years ago, following a pre-set pattern now. A lot of people live in London, with partners. Everyone except me has a job. We are engineers, a solicitor, an actuary, an accountant. But we play football and I still cannot play football, and everyone else can compared to me and we fuck about in a park and go back and watch cricket. There's less drinking and no drugs now, more eating, but we still separate along the same lines: me, John and Jamie end up going out in Welly on a Saturday night and go to the Vint, which has completely changed, so that we only stay for one drink and head home to my house where John plays Tony Hawk's 4 on my iBook for an hour while me and Jamie watch, then Jamie goes back to John's house where he's staying, the same pattern we've followed in fact for ten years. There've been subtle evolutions in that time, but seamless. It makes me sentimental.
