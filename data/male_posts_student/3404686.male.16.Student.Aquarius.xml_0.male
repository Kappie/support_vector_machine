Anyway when I got to school and started my first exam, it was so easy. It took me like 45 mins. tops, everyone else took almost an hour and a half. Then in my next exam, I was done in less then 30mins. Their wasn't another person done for like an hour. It was suppose to be the hardest exam. I almost laughed at how easy it was. That was pretty much how it was for my last exams today too. So I guess all that studying was a waste of my time. I could have been working on my website, or something. O well, can't change it now.
