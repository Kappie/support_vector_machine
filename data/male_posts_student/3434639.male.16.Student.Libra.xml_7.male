Time is money and the time spent doing laundry should be spent on brainstorming ways to conquer the world or become the richest man in this side of the solar system.(if you dont know what the solar system is then i suggest you tie juicy pieces of steaks to yourself and jump into a lion exhibit druing lunch hour at your local zoo!!)  2. It is inefficeint because after doing your laundry you have the tedious tasks of hanging your clothes out to dry and doing ironing, folding and storing them. More time wasted on pointless tasks.  Someone out there should invent clothes which are water proof, stain proof, stench proof, tear proof, bullet proof, air proof, moss proof, cat proof, and so on and so on(make sure they are not human proof if not we cannot wear them =P), you get the idea.I would have done this earlier but my superior intelledt is being called by more pressing issues ( doing homework- stupid college).
