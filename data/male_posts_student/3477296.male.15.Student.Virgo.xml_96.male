"i feel" and "i have a weird feeling..." in this case does not refer to loving someone...but obviously you wouldn't know what its like to love someone now would you? *glare ^__^* i'm also questioning whether jono is human - being moody is natural when someone feels sad or depressed and it is only when it occurs in excess and to an unbearable extent can it be classified as PMS. "[feelin] regretful" is also another  human  quality which jono obviously lacks. pfft.  jono...you are clearly bored --- i don't think playing so many games of DDR, watching Mean Girls, followed by soccer training was beneficial to your brain whatsoever.  LMAO. aiya...bored malaysian jono...*sigh* you have no hope.
