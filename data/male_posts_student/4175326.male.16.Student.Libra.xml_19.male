Pretty much all thats left of the once original and innovative scene is a bunch of Hot Topic look alikes who bitch about their wealthy upbringing. Fuck them, they are total bullshit. I'm sick of hearing Good Charlotte's singer whine about how he misses daddy, and about how bad his parent's divorce was. More than 1/2 of America's  married couples get a divorce, get over it. My parents are on the verge of leaving eachother, but am I trying to make some money off of their marital troubles? Hell no, because unlike these preppy posers that are so popular today, I don't make music for money. Do you think Johnny Rotten would bitch about how hard his Irish working class upbringing was? Hell no. Could you imagine Sid Vicious rummaging through Hot Topic looking for some over-produced  Simple Plan t-shirt? Hell  no. If you're gonna call yourselves a punk band, get it right guys. Make you're own clothes, be rude, be politically incorrect, be outragous, spit on people, be loud, be original and DON'T BE GENERIC.  All the great punk bands had their own special thing, The Sex Pistols couldn't play a note but had amazing stage presence and really got the fans to go crazy, the Clash were influenced by reggae, the Dead Kennedys had an awesome surfer sound, the misfits rambled on about alien invasions, rapeing mothers and killing babies. Good, original shit. And what do Simple Plan, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, Bowling for Soup, Sum 41, etc... have? The same old recycled pop shit. They harmonize about girlfriends and how being upper middle class is so hard. Fuck you  preppy bands, you got me all pissed off now. I'm gonna go spray paint all the stop signs now, just because you got me all worked up.... assholes.
