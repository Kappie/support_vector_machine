Ohhhh no   I will leave the grudge bearing to my loyal armys of highly trained mindless drones who will gladly spend the rest of their otherwise pointless lives hunting down and (as they say in scientologist circles) Exteriorising those who have displeased me   Anyhooooo now i've gotten that out of the way   I have been asked to recommend the admission to this Blog of Mr Ben MacDonald  and even if not him then maybe some other new people would be a gud idea   all that remains for me to say is quite simply... GO FLYERS Y'ALL GO KICK SOME SORRY ASS DEVILS ALL THE WAY BACK TO NEW JERSEY   EXPERTS SAY THAT THE DEVILS WILL NOT REPEAT THEIR STANLEY CUP SUCCESS  GO FLYERS!!!!
