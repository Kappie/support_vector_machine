I tried - but they wanted cash.  ==================================================  A child's greatest period of growth is the month after you've purchased newn school uniforms.  ==================================================  Don't feel bad. A lot of people have no talent.  ==================================================  Don't marry the person you want to live with, marry the one you cannot live without... but whatever you do, you'll regret it later.  ==================================================  You can't buy love . . . but you pay heavily for it.  ==================================================  True friends stab you in the front.  ==================================================  Forgiveness is giving up my right to hate you for hurting me.  ==================================================  Bad officials are elected by good citizens who do not vote.  ==================================================  Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired.  =================================================  My wife and I always compromise. I admit I'm wrong and she agrees with me.  =================================================  Those who can't laugh at themselves leave the job to others.  =================================================  Ladies first. Pretty ladies sooner.  =================================================  It doesn't matter how often a married man changes his job, he still ends up with the same boss.  =================================================  Real friends are the ones who survive transitions   between address books.  =================================================  Saving is the best thing. Especially when your parents have done it for you.  =================================================  Wise men talk because they have something to say; fools talk because they have to say something.  =================================================  They call our language the mother tongue because the father seldom gets to speak.  =================================================
