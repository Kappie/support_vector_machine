It was an outcry voiced by some 250,000 people, right in the heart of Melbourne, and was repeated all over the world. Together, millions of us expressed our grief at the plight of our world: specifically, the violence that would now sweep Iraq and possibly more of the Middle-East, and the fear and hatred that had entered the minds of those millions who supported an un-justifyable war. This unified expression of grief and anger did not go unheeded on the international stage.  What if, a few weeks before the impending US Election, posters begin to appear for another rally. These posters state something along the lines of: "On the day the US Election is decided, we will rally in grief, or in celebration." If Bush is re-elected, the world erupts in a series of synchronized protests - a simple, powerful message to the Republican government: that the world is far, far from happy. If Bush is denied a second term in office, we rally anyway... We hold a big fucking party in the streets.  Most likely, this news will be mourned or celebrated by the individual - by small groups, organizations, and families. I just think, wouldn't it be nice, if we could  all  come together and deal with this, whichever way things turn. Bush's antics affect us all, so why not respond to their continuation or end on a global scale?  And I guess that's the end of my hypothetical.  --- Hillary
