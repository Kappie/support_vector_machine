Busy with poetry taking a break  As i look up at the sky today I feel a greater good staring back at me Fills me up and makes me wonder Are my dreams being shared with someone else?  The songs stuck in my head playing over and over Taking sips from my iced tea I'm pretty laidback Chillin around smoke myself a pack Walking to my room Fall on my bed all feeling sleepy Slip in some CDs volume's full blast  I stare at my ceiling Sounds from my system fill the air Filling up fast The sounds forever they last
