I wore my suit to work today - it's a new suit, silk lined, which my mother told me in no uncertain words "looks like a bag of shit". Yeeeowza, thanks' mama. I showed her the spot on the jacket where the seam had begun to fall apart (I've had this suit number in months) and she promptly seized the jacket and proclaimed (I shit you not, this was some serious proclaimage) that it was going back.  I hope I get some say in what I get in exchange. Not bloodly likely though. Didn't something like this happen to Norman Bates? (incidently, as a child under the age of 12, wouldn't that have labelled him Master Bates? Isn't that reason enough alone to become a serial killer?)  So today at work, I get there, sit down with the BodherRotor and we discuss. We chit chat about clearance. About Glennis. About the little things that make work work. Conversation over...  Oh and, by the way. He pulls the fucking Columbo on me. I'm gobsmacked as he then details that first interview for the SMD program is *tomorrow*. Say wha? Yeah. That's right. Tomorrow. Here you go - the Management resumé - fill that fucker out (Darcy's been working on his for a few weeks - I get one night) and, oh yeah, I need you to fill out this SMD Evaluation and Recommendation form as well, we'll compare it to what I have tomorrow. Gad - fucking - zooks.   So I sat down, converted the pdf into a doc and typed away - I'm not into the whole "Handwriting" thing - it's so very 20th. Worst part is, I'm completely self-horn-blowing. Not really in the business of telling people "yeah, I'm good, here's why". Meh.  We crushed target again tonight - that's always nice.  Then there's the big fat man who tried to steal things. I'm doing my rounds and Dave's there. He looks freaked. He says "Dude, the guy behind you just stuffed about five camcorder batteries down his pants". I turn around. Tubs and Crocket is standing there and he's at least 325lbs if he's an ounce. Black sweat pants. White high tops. Dirty white leafs shirt. Black Mossimo hat (go Zellers!). He's carrying a basket in which we have a single camcorder battery. A quick glance to the display shows a missing set of batteries, about four in total. I attach myself to his hip. Through the store I follow him, he's aware I'm doing it too. He starts to remove batteries from his pants. Disgusting. He's got all of them out and tries to walk out with the basket. One of the girls intercepts him. He goes to pay with a wad of cash, not even counting he says "oh, I don't have enough, I'll be right back, goin out to the car". I follow him outside. He stands outside, in the rain. His phone does not ring. He pulls it out, flips it open and without hitting a button begins a loud conversation. When he is done faking the conversation he turns to face me. I say "Do you have any other unpaid merchandise for which you'd like to pay?". He says "Are you accusing me of theft? What's your name. I want your card. Do you have a card?" To which I reply "Of course I have a card. I'm certainly not giving it to you. Name's on the tag, write it down if you have to." He steps right up to me, his 6'2 to my 5'10. I don't even fucking flinch. The rage is boiling right now, but I'm Kwai-Chang-fucking-Calm. Staring down at me and sweating he says "Are you accusing me of theft?!"  I have a zen like moment. Inside the butterfly in Peking of my right eyelid flaps it's wings and the veritable tempest of laughter nearly erupts out of the New York of my gut. I smile. "Perhaps you're hard of hearing. I asked you a simple yes or no question. Do you have any other unpaid merchandise for which you'd like to pay?"  "You can search me"  "I'd rather not. Yes or no?"  "No."  "Excellent. Have a lovely day. Feel free to come back anytime. I'll be sure to look for you." I stand fast. Fire clearly burns in his piggy little eyes, set so deep in his skull you can barely tell they're blue. His fu manchu moustache quivers as his lip flicks. He's searching desperately for a comeback, neurons firing like batteries of missles over the persian gulf... but... nothing. He squints, rolling the fat of his face together obscuring his ocularies. He turns. He strides off at an impressive pace for a waddler and answers another non-existant phone call. The drizzle falls. I return to my fortress of solitude.  We won. It's a beautiful thing, a phyrric victory sadly, but god damn, it felt good.
