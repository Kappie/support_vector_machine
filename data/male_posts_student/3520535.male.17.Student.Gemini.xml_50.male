The man who sat in the back corner of the room was as much a part of his surroundings as the dusty lamp on the table or the paintings on the wall. This symbiosis was shattered as he rose to answer the persistent knocking. As he opened the door, a man with a noose hanging limply about his seemingly broken neck walked in. “Ah, Death. Good to see you,” the man greeted him, “but don’t you think that you’re being a bit over the top? I mean, this is just too Masque of the Red Death for you.” “Point taken,” said Death, as he took a seat across from his host at a table, “but this is the form in which I present myself to you today.” “A hanging?” He asked. “No,” Replied death, “look at the quality of the noose. It’s obviously home made.” “Oh! A suicide. I see now. Are you trying to get me to kill myself then?” Inquired the man. “You got it,” Said death, “we’ve been friends your whole life and I’ve shown you many things; how to keep yourself company, how to hurt when no one cares. This is just one of your options that I, as the embodiment of Death, am obliged to offer to you.” The man sat across from Death looking more comfortable than most would in this situation. He leaned back and smiled. “Now why would I want to kill myself?” Death took this opportunity to slide out of his chair and begin an overly dramatic stroll about the study. He began to speak, gesturing at the room he walked through, “This room is the room of your mind. You come here to feel safe. In your body you are probably not feeling as safe as you appear here. I know you aren’t.” He paused and looked at the man in the chair. “You know what I’m talking about. I’ve met very few as genuinely self-destructive as you are. You have problems in your life, everyone does, but you get so pushed around by them. Don’t you think that it’s time to let go?” “I’m able to handle it,” defended the man. “Well,” Countered Death, “perhaps you haven’t kept everything in perspective. Your girlfriend moved. You’ve said yourself that things won’t be as easy with anyone else as they were with her. Oh yes, you know there will be others. But you know there will be problems. And you know you don’t fit the molds they have ready for you.” The man stood and began a pace similar to that of Death. He composed himself and then began to counter, “I’ll be able to make it work. We will. And I’ve been comfortable with other people. And some I want to make work.” A smile flickered across Death’s previously blank façade. “Oh, her. Well, you know how that’s going. Need I remind you of all of the conflicts? What does she want? You don’t know but you know that you can’t give it to her. And as for the other you are referring to… well we know where that one’s going. Both ideas. They’re from different worlds. You are here a little too late. Or maybe too early.” “Ok, that’s true. Things were always easier with Sarah. Even in that regard. But you know that we could try…” The man’s voice was becoming more wistful as he lost himself in the objects in the room of his mind. He was toying with a small flag at a stand and wondering what it was reminding him of. Red, black, yellow lines crossed his eyes. Death became more confrontational. “Look, we can’t keep milling on your relationships and relationships you won’t have. That’s the stuff that teenage angst is made of. You know that you go beyond that. Take for instance the problems with your family, your future, and most of all your two private pains. Why do you hurt yourself so?” The man lost his composure for the first time and ran his hands through his hair, turning away from his old friend Death to hid his pained expression. He walked over to an old photo album and leafed through pictures of his youth, pausing at the changes through high school. “You know the answer to that. Here, this is your answer.” Death walked over to the album. “Senior year? Well, yes, I suppose that was your goal. But it hasn’t happened yet. It doesn’t have to be that way. There’s the healthier route. There’s that way. And then there’s simple death. I’m always here waiting for you.” “I can’t do that. I may not have much to live for but I’ll not take my own life,” The man declared, a new sense of purpose resounding in his manner. Death chuckled. “And why not? You and I both know you have nothing to loose when you check out. Nothing you’ll pay for. No afterlife to worry about. And it beats the hell you put yourself through.” “My pain is my own,” the troubled man stated, “Just because I do it myself doesn’t mean that I’m pushed to it. I know the consequences of my actions.” “But what of those who you profess to love? How do these things affect them?” Death asked, “You know that when they find out you’ll only be killing them.” “Yes Death, old friend, but my own death would be worse. And my own optimism is what I have to live for. I know now why. The world was made for people like me. To seize the reigns, to have what is ours. And optimism is not a failed philosophy as you’ve told me all these years, I’ve found a way of reminding myself of that.” He was holding a picture now, a photo of a girl who was smiling next to him on a bed. “This is one last juncture in my life that I’ve past. I think it’s time we both leave this room and get on with our lives.” “Very well,” Said Death, “Until you need me again.”
