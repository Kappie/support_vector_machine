This morning I woke up and felt a huge sigh of relief as on Monday and Tuesday I had some exams at school and this morning felt like a huge weight had been taken off my shoulder!  School was pretty boring today. We had an extended tutorial first lesson (Where we did a lot of stuff about our 'Yearly Reports') and that was quite boring, while second lesson we had to sit in silence and write essays (Which lesson am I talking about? English of course!). Third lesson was quite boring as it was science; my least favourite lesson. I went home for lunch and had time to 'chill' then I went back to skewl for my fave lesson I.C.T!  After having two hours of I.C.T I went home and began creating this blog! Not a lot has really gone on today - what a suprise, but I hope that tomorrow will be more exciting.  I have nothing planned tonight. I might go out but I doubt it as I have a lot of homework to do, but I keep putting it off as half term is next week! I dont really have anything planned next week. I might go to the movies and see the new Harry Potter movie if I can be asked too. I will talk more about it when the time comes!  If you want to know anything more about my 'exciting' day then go ahead and ask. I doubt you want to hear any more of my 'exciting' day lol so I am going to sign off now!  C Ya!  Stefan
