Although, I have been thinking a lot lately............See, there is this person that I like, I mean REALLY like. For now, lets call this person randomperson1. So, I've liked randomperson1 for the majority of the year, but every time I think about asking her, I find out the next day that she has a boyfriend. It is so crazy. Oh well. I'm just gonna get back to my crappy homework, and my drawings which are also crappy :).   later, bradleyJ
