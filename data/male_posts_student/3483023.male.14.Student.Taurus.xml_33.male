If You Can't Tell I Kinda Did This Last Weeks Monday-Thursday Blogs Today, I Just Changed The Date So It Would Appear I Wrote Them On The Date On Which The Events Occured. I Come Home To Find We Have New Neigboors On Top Of Us And They Are Being A 'Lil Loud, Ok, That Are Being Way To Loud! I Only Got 49 EMails From When I Was Gone, I Figured I Would Have 100 To 150! My Gerbil (Silver Ryan) Surivived The Week W/ Me Being Gone, I Was Happy To Find He Survived, But I Know Deep Down He Would!
