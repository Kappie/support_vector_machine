But at least, now, i've more or less made up my mind.  However, 1st of all, i would like to thank all those friends out there whom have helped me and giving me advice as well as criticised me.  To Michelle, thanks for being a great friend and simply for giving me advice that made me think and made me realise that i had to be more down to earth and stay grouned to reality. Thanks especially cause i guess, we've not being talking as much as we used to.  To Nartz, thanks for being there and just for listening to my problems, your presence and lively deposition in much appreciated. Yup, and relax girl! You are like, super stressed! But thanks anyway for being a friend.  To Wan Yi, thanks for offering that listening ear, but remember what i told you before all these happened? Yup, believe in that, cause i guess, that's the decision, but keep it to yourself 1st yeah. Take care lah! Forever getting sick one you!  To Shawn, thanks for being my cu qi tong, letting me let out my negative energy all at you. It was much needed and you couldn't have come at a better time. Thanks.  To Yong Xi, hey man, thanks for being so down to earth with me too, keeping me sane and giving me sound advice whenever i needed help and simply for noticing my mood swings. Xie Xie Ni.  Ok, back to business. I've thought much and i guess, with Kelly and Cherie talking to me after that, i've sorted out more or less all that i feel i needed to with regards to this problem. Sure, the decisions and ideas were really hard, but i had to make it, didn't want to hurt both of them in the end. However, i've kind of made my decision for serious lah. Heex... and i guess, i am contented and happy with it, though there is a part of it which hurts cause of that decision. Alas, that's life ain't it?  I wish i could really choose both of them, but, it's not possible is it? Besides, i am pretty sure no one would like to share that other person with another would they? Kelly, i know that i've been a jerk as to what has happened so far, but i guess, it's to late and it doesn't matter anymore right? After all, that's what has been said between us so frequently and so recently right? Haha... i wish that was true though, it certainly did matter to me with regards to everything, but, i guess, i just had to respect whatever decision you made at that point of time and hope that it was the best for you and you would be happy in it. Wasn't it our agreement that at the end of it, so long as we were happy with the decision or with what we did, than everything was right? haha... sad ain't it? I am not entirely happy with the idea, but, i don't find it to be entirely right either, but i guess... nevertheless, it has to be this way, i am still waiting, waiting to know what is it you really think and feel... but i guess, with you saying that it doesn't matter, i would never find out will i? oh well... Just wishing you the best in everything that you do and that you'll be happy with everything then... i guess, that's how it's going to end right? i don't know, but, it's up to you...  Hey Cherie! Thanks so much for being there for me, and most of all... for believing in me, you certainly are special to me and i hold you close to my heart. thanks for being everything that you are to me. thanks... Take care of yourself ok?  Well, that's all i can say now, other than that, i'll tell the consequences and the truth to everything when the time is right i guess... till then... everyone, take care and keep smiling! :p
