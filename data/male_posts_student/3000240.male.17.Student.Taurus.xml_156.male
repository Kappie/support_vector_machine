Enough with the commenting on the corporate influence -   this   is what they intended amidst their devious ploying:  gossip and more gossip  within there gospel.    Why however, am I talking to youupon such an early hour, within a vastdry writing season personally speaking. Well, sleeping never really got back to basics, so here I am.      BuBz Diet Update      Moderate/good since our last dialogue, need to curb the nocturnal munching somewhat, and I reckon that with the array of cuisine shrinking by the day, this diet won't be as hard as I presumed it would have been.      I think in the last few days, I must have pataken in more high/hippy/with a large transparent townie front drugs session. I've done bong, week, skunk and after a while of doing it, as usual with activities I join in with when I gather a certain confidence in myself, I take a huge liking to it, and so that's why at 3am on Saturday, I could just barely catch a glimmer of coud 9 as it sailed past Jen's living room window. Anyway, I shall reveal more of recent happenings at a more excessive/mentally accesableperiod. Ciao . . .
