Laura called and confirmed we were leaving and a couple minutes later (after Cindy prepared a meal for herself in the microwave) we left to get Linda.  Her new place is down on University and Goodman, a nice huge apartment complex.  We made our way to the inner loop, 490 and finally 390.  We traveled what seemed like 60 miles north to the lake, and we took exit 27b like the directions said.  However, we should have taken 27a and we ended up doing a U turn on a highway.  That was fun:  Luke: Hold on! Passengers: AAaaaAaAhaahhhhh!!!  Okay, maybe nobody was screaming or maybe I was screaming, I tend to forget.  But we got to the beach and Luke had already cooked the kabobs.  He put my hot dogs on and we ate great food and talked about a half hour.  We went and got ice cream (thanks Cindy!) and walked along the lake, eventually making our way back to where Linda was sitting and reading in the grass.  We played frisbee for awhile but Cindy wanted to go so she could do homework.   urlLink    Laura and Luke, cooking on the grill  urlLink    Laura choking Luke  urlLink    Me, from above, my best angle :)   Linda and I hung out for an hour, watched Newlyweds (such a funny show) and then I took her home.  She is deathly afraid of cats and would scream when Ashley would look at her.  I kept putting her in the other room but Linda said to let her in cause she was whining and scratching the door.  Blah.  That wasn't fun.  I came back, burned a couple DVDs, watched TV, cleaned a little and went to bed.  I woke up to a pile of garbage all over my doorstep.  Completely gross, it smelled and was nasty and wet.  Thanks whoever did that.  The entire day dragged on, but I managed I get quite a bit accomplished.  I'll have to tell you more later.  I'm really looking forward to this weekend, so much to do and Cindy is coming along.  She wants to meet my mother's horse.  Garry is out Friday and Monday.  It's nice when people take so much vacation.  I'm REALLY looking forward to my 2 weeks off in July.  I borrowed two more DVDs from the MMC.  Hopefully I won't run these over with my bike.  Oops.  The guy knows me by name since I go get DVDs every day now.    Ugh, I skipped the gym twice this week due to lunch dates and appointments.  I am going to go in a couple minutes to make up for it.  I don't like working out in the evenings.. it takes away from me time.  I'm so selfish.  Oh, and apparently monogamy is in our genes.   urlLink Click here.
