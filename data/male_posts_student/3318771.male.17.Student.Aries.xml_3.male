Its so peculiar, I hate Totti for his guts for his arrogance and mostly for his behaviour. Maybe he is just 1 of those supporters who support Lazio for the sake of supporting but at the same time he follows other teams in the EPL and SPL. As for me, I am only dedicated to Lazio, everyday of my life, I follow Lazio. How? Through the best site in the world  urlLink http://www.laziofever.com where all the Laziali in the world unite from Asia, to Europe, to the Middle East, to the South America and to the U.S., amazing website, and its all thanks to them that I am now a huge Laziali and being able to follow them everyday.   Why not EPL? Why S.S. Lazio? A team which is on the verge of losing their entire squad, on the verge of bankcruptcy. Because I have feelings for them, not just for the sake of supporting, I will wake up 3.30 am Mondays just to watch them play. I will cry when they win and also I will celebrate. I am never through a day without reading about Lazio. Lazialita is in my blood and it will never run out. Forza Lazio  Time to recall some memories. The most recent: The Coppa Italia victory against Juventus. Final score on aggregate 4-3 which was a fantastic result, winning 2-1 in rome and drawing 2-2 in Turin which was a fantastic result. I was speechless on that day, I was on the verge of tears, happiness was in my eyes, and most importantly, we won our 1st trophy since 2000. Some wonderful moments, Cesar dribbled his way through from our half to Juve's half and on the way, juggling over Thuram, simply amazing, not many players can do that. But sadly he may leave Lazio this season, something which I hope will not happen but then again, nothing is forever, if we get a good offer for him, w\he would be gone, right now, only Lazio is important, not Cesar, not Nesta, not Corradi and not anyone else.   Right now, I am in the Computer Lab typing this entry, I finished my work quickly at about 11.30 pm and ever since then, I have been slacking. Oh well, there's this new chapter on tables, which I would like to learn more about and thus enhance my website in a whole new way. I wore shorts to school, because I don't have any available jeans and I am not going to wear that cargo pants which looks so ugly. What is there for me to say? I wanna talk all day long about Lazio, but with so much uncertainty, so much clouds, so much mist, what can I even say? Speculation would just end up in disappointment, so far now I shall maintainmy calmness and tranquility until Lotito announces our new coach.
