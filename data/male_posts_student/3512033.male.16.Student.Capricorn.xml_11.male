A: omfg i am leaving this subject...  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  anyhoo... i think i did alright in my exams today...  but no matter how easy the exams are, they still involve at least the energy to sit up in my seat, let alone small amounts of brainpower... therefore, i am gradually getting tireder and tireder.... so looking forward to my goal of 15 hours sleep on friday night...   i think thats enough for today... i have so much else to talk about, but i think i'll keep you all in suspense... hehehe, stay tuned for the next episode of nonnahs mail... same bat time, same bat channel...
