But as I lay in bed trying to go to sleep I could not help but want to cry. The summer is over the fun will slow life will become real again. In my heart I can not help but wish life could become more surreal again. I do not want to deal with my senior year. I think about it and cringe because of the fact that Im no longer in school with the people i know. There will be no more pranks on each other, no hangin out at lunch. I will probably choose not to go to my Prom cause i see no point. I will probably not even get to see my friends graduate. I know that as this school year begins it also must end and that is somthing i do not want. I will truly be alone after highschool. I will go to college(or art instute) and probably never see any of these people again. I cant even say oh well there will be a ten year reunion cause for me there wont be. I'm so scared of not knowing what im gonna do. As i start my last year of highschool I cant even say that ive figured out who i really am. Im a stranger to myself and most others and i dont know how im gonna survive. Some would say trust in God, but ive taken this to him and ive gotten no response. I feel as if in the time that it turns out i most need someone, there is no one. Even in this though I will hide from everyone my sense of lonlyness. It is none of any of thems concern they will go on and continue life while in My heart and mind I try to run from it. I pretend to be just a big kid so that i dont have to really think about whats going to happen latter i can just live in the now. I used to look foward to the future and as i thought about things last week decisions were easy to make but now that I can see the time for those decisions to take effect I cant see myself going through with them. all of this is made worse by the fact that this time next year alot of my friends will be gone and i will have no one to turn to for any kind of comfort. But there lives must go on and so they shall while i watch from the side lines wondering if I will get over my fears.
