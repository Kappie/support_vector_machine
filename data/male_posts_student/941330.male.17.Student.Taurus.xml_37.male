We aren't exactly coached well.   Moreau kinda disappointed me. Sure, they're all rich and Catholic and uh..."powered by God"...but for $3,000+ a year tuition, they had a pretty lame team, track, clothes, etc. Except for this one guy who's nicknamed 49 because of his 400 time...I had what, a 69, and he ran a 52. Still damn impressive. Jason Koide's legs are just motors, he was awesome today. Good weather too. It's gonna rain soon though, damn...I'm actually kinda excited about our Saturday meet...yeah, I'm weird like that.  Rough draft due Monday for Lott? Mother...fucker. I dunked hella people in PE today...Adam, Parisa, Ahmer, Jason, Anna, Sarah, Kristy, Parisa, Anitra...a who's who of dunkees. Alex really got me good though. I couldn't get Ankur, he interpreted my attempt in a...different way. (Haha, Parisa's sandals were comfortable!) And boy, Richard is one slippery...boy.  Who's taking AP Bio?
