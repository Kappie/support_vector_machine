In related news, I read about 250 pages in my summer reading in about 2 hours to finally  finish,  and now my mind is  fried.  All I got to do is write a short little 5 page report and I'm done. There's the matter of the test on the book I never even opened this Friday, but I'll just cheat or something.  ...don't get me wrong, cheating is bad, it hurts more than it helps, education is important, and all that jazz, but sometimes you just don't  care.  Apathy's never a good thing, but I don't feel like stopping it anytime soon (see how vicious a cycle it causes?).  On second thought, I think I'll just resort to good old fashioned cramming. Nothing like a good cram session to wear out the brain and make sure that I won't remember anything in the book ever. I'll read it eventually...just not now.  I feel like adding a drawing to this because...well, I feel like adding a drawing to this. I don't really have any sroties for today since most of it was spent reading and sleeping, but I'd feel bad for not including something. So, here's a picture of The Punisher I drew in MSPaint (as usual) for Moon Kitsune, if I remember the screenname correctly. This was for a MSPaint request thread I did last week; I could have done better, but it came out ok considering how fast I went.     Although MSPaint's fun (really, it is), I need to start using good old pen and paper more often. Maybe if I can actually find a place to put my stupid scanner, I can make use of it. That is if I can figure out how to make it stop saving 20 10MB files at a time...
