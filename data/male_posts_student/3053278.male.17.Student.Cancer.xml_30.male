There is a topic I wanted to adress but the only reason is that it's related to one of my dreams. About 3 weeks back I was awoken by a dream...well now it seems like a nightmare. I was at a fencing meet and everything was going well,it seemed we were winning and who we were fencing wasn't important. All of the sudden I noticed that I was getting ready to fence. This is where I did something I had never done before. I had just been hooked up and I was bending over to tie a black piece of cloth around my leg. This scared me because I would only do this if I was honoring someone I had lost. What was really strange was that marcus was there cheering me on and in uniform so it couldn't be next year. I was confused and I started fencing and then woke up. Thinking about it later I realized that I was the only one wearing the cloth so it must have been someone close to me.  About a week and half later, I got the scare of my life. My grandmother(father's side) was diagnosed with cancer. The dream I'm afraid might have a connection. I hope she fully recovers and the dream was just a warning not a prediction. The surgery she went thru was seemingly successful and we don't get the results until at least monday so I hope for the best.
