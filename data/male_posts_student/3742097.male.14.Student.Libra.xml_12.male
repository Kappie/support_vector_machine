There was one exibit in particular that I wanted to see, it is a letter a guy wrote, and I didn't see it so I wasn't too happy about that. And I forgot my camera, so I didn't get to take pictures. And then, lol, I went there with $41 in my pocket. I spent $61. Thank god I have an ATM card. Wait, thank god my dad has an ATM card for my account that I hold. And I am not supposed to use the card for stuff like that, but he won't know it. So I had to take out $20, and I was telling my grandparents this. And they were all dissapointed that I spent that much. So my grandfather, Daddy Warbucks, gave me the 20 I spend back and told me to put it in the bank. And I will, oh I will.  Today was the fourth of July, the birthday of out country, John Sterling (Yankee radio broadcaster), my cousin Bo (who will be here this summer YAY!) and the infamous George Steinbrenner. Queue Empire Theme from Star Wars. And no I am not going to go on a rant about the Yankees payroll and how it is justified and helps the game.  We had a picnic at my other grandmother's house. The one whose husband, my poppy, passed away in August of 1998. At the picnic I saw my cousin who I haven't seen in a while. His name is Tyler and he just graduated from High School. And in a couple of months he is enlisting into the Navy. It was great to catch up with him and see what he has been up to, but I really didn't talk to him and I found myself avoiding him. But he is still a cool guy. : )  So my grandfather died in 1998, when I was only 8 years old. And back then his death didn't effect me, at all. I just saw it as someone who I would not see again, someone who went on a permanant vacation. But one night of last school year I was online talking to Julianna and I remembered something. After he died days after I went with my grandfather and my cousin, Megan, to get ice cream. It wasn't a special trip to make us feel better, it was just the norm. And I remember we were on a bridge that runs over the railroad and Megan pointed a cloud out to me. And I looked at the cloud and I said, "That's poppy." It looked like a man sitting down against a tree fishing. And my grandfather loved to fish. Back then I didn't really care I just thought it was cool that there was a cloud that looked like my grandfather. But that night on the computer I remembered that cloud. And I guess then, almost 6 years later, it hit me, he is really gone. Now, you are probably laughing at me right now. Good for you, you can now click the X at the top left of your browser. And in my computer chair I did something that I didn't do in my life. I mourned over the passing of my grandfather. I cried my eyes out, I cried like a two year old who just had its toy taken away. And Julianna helped me through it. And that was the best, I had someone there to help me through it. Then my dadc came in and yelled at me for being up at 3 in the morning. But the very next day at breakfast I asked my mom, "Are we going to poppy's grave this year." She said, "I don't know, why are you asking." I simply said, "I want to go." And I said it demandingly, like we are going and I don't care if you don't want to. And my mom said, "Okay, we will go." And I don't know what will happen the day my grandmother, my mom and I make the trip up to his grave. But I can count on one thing, my eyes will not be dry. And my mom might understand. But it doesn't matter.  I will try to keep posts more joyous, but I had to get that out. Ahh, it's 12 and I am playing tennis with my dad tomorrow, early. He has the week off. So I am going to be very tired at the end of the week from all of the tennis I will be playing. Goodnight everyone.
