Whether its the first or the 50th, each year together is a triumph.  APPRECIATION Let him know how much you love and appreciate him once in a while. He may know it already but hearing it from you is always better.  Butter him up once in a while. Guys like to be reminded of their strong points.  BEST FRIENDS Make sure he's your best friend before you think of getting engaged. The strong bond of friendship will help you through tough times.  Be best friends, preferably even before being boyfriend-girlfriend. Take time to know each other so the relationship is a deep one. Tell him about your crushes, your dreams, your problems. Cry to him if you're going through a personal crisis. You'll be surprised how good his advice can be.  BOND Make it a point to spend time together often, but leave enough room so he doesn't feel smothered.  Spend time alone with each other. Individuals can be involved separately in their own projects or careers and at the end of the day they share their experiences.  CHANGING EACH OTHER Don't marry an asshole. Once a jerk, always a jerk. You'll never change him. Really wait for the right guy.  Don't get married thinknig he'll change for you. Its unfair to get involved with someone when you're thinking of doing an overhaul on them.  COMPLIMENTS always compliment each other. This will prevent feelings of resentment and thinking that one is being taken for granted.  DATE Keep doing things that you both enjoy, and do them together. Watching movies, playing badminton, people watching, reading and more. When you do things together and when these are things you both enjoy, how can you not have a wonderful relationship? Take note, this doesn't mean you have to do everything together. Shared pleasures is just one of those things that most couples forget.  Make time and continue to date to keep the romance. Look good, smell good to maintain the physical attraction.  DIFFERENCES Celebrate your differences (personality, upbringing, religion, mental ability, earning capacity, etc). Never force your ideologies down his throat, or vice versa. You both need to retain your individuality.  Give up trying to turn your partner into you. Accept your differences and learn to appreciate them.  FIGHTS Fight with the aim to resolve the issue. Don't endlessly go on trying to outdo each other. The longer you extend the fight, the more chances you'll say something hurtful that you don't really mean.  The world will not end if you both go to bed mad at each other. Forget what your mom or parish priest says. Trying to resolve big fights late at night is impossible, especially if you both have to go to school or work the next morning. In fact, sometimes an uncomfortable night of madness is just what you need so you see things clearly. As mad as you were last night, this is still the guy who laughs at your jokes and thinks you're hot, despite all the petty fags who go by. Go to bed mad at each other, and you will wake up feeling more strongly that you want to make up.  Respect and trust each other. Even when having an all-out brawl, be careful not to cross the line with your partner. Or if you do, take a deep breath, suck it in, and apologize (but never get physical).  When you fight, hear each other out but don't dig up old issues.  Be careful what you say in a fight. You cannot take back hurtful, insulting words.  Choose your battles: Make sure the fight will be worth it and that something will change in the relationship as a result of the fight.  Don't be afraid to talk, discuss, argue.  FLAWS Know the perfect guy does not exist (thank God I found someone pretty damn close). The sooner you realize this, the easier your relationship will be. Know that just as there are things that you love about him, there will be things that will drive you crazy. No matter who you're with, there will always be something. Just like you, he's only human with his own flaws and foibles. Lighten up and enjoy life. Try to shrug off the petty annoyances. In the long run of life, they don't matter a bit.  FUN Have fun together! If you're going to be stuck in each other's company for the rest of your lives, the least you should do is enjoy your time together. This means keeping the fun and spontaneity that was there in the early days. Driving out for midnight snacks when the craving hits, talking till morning (even on a school day), running off on impromptu trips, having monday morning errand and breakfast days... whatever strikes your fancy. Nothing kills the fun faster than too much planning and too much scheduling. Ugh!  Allow yourselves to get silly. Shower together, pee with the door open, wear your ugly undies. The more barries you break physically, the more you break emotionally.  Enjoy being silly. Being able to make each other laugh and see the lighter, crazier absurd side of life is the best way to get through all the differences in personalities, adjustments in lifetyles and opposing viewpoints that exist in all relationships. Plus there's added bonus of keeping a happier perspective on things!  GOALS Make sure you have similar goals as a team. It would be difficult to keep your bond intact of your views are complete opposites.  GRUDGES Quit tabulating grudges. Le off steam when something's pissing you off, discuss it, then trash it. Dnot recycle it.  KEEPING IT HOT Keep it hot by travelling to different places together. A new setting can do wonders.  KISSING Make time for a real kiss at least once a day (and go wherever that takes you). I'm not talking about perfunctory pecks. I'm talking about taking a deep breath and just kissing him, at least once a day. At bedtime if you like, or before you each go to school or work. If the mood escalates, you can go with the flow, but you don't have to. Just kissing is intimate, romantic and relationship-strengthening in a very special way.  KNOW EACH OTHER Learn about each other's interest. Be it cars, fashion, art, gadgets, books, music, sports, etc. It truly keeps the conversation flowing!  HONESTY Don't lie or hide things. The problem will only get bigger.  HUG A hug can be far more intimate than a kiss.  IDENTITY Don't lose your personality. Thats why he fell in love with you!  Don't lose your identity. Work, study, hang out with your own friends.  Have separate interests and activities to keep your individuality; and to be able to contribute more to the relationship.  INTENTIONS Wish each other well. Some couples, when they begin to dislike each other, they wish each other the worst! This is rather stupid. His success is yours and vice versa.  ISSUES Speak up about the awkward stuff now, like money and sex. The earlier, the better.  LISTEN When he talks to you about his problems, don't be too eager to solve them. Just make it a point to listen.  Listen, listen, listen. Hear each other out, especially during arguments. This will also keep you from saying hurtful words. Its not about getting your point across, its about comprehending each other's feelings.  LOOK GOOD Exercise together. It doesn't have to be three times a week or anything like that. Maybe you could have a gym date instead of a dinner date. Or jogging around sanlo park or have sex. Whatever it is, it has to be physical and at least once a week. When you keep in tune with your own body, its easier to tune into each other's bodies.  Mind your appearance! Stay fit and healthy for each other.  LOVE It all boils down to your love, chemistry, and respect for each other. Your relationship can't really be planned or strategized. There are no fail-safe solutions or advice. MOTHERING Never mother him. Be his partner, not his mother!  MIND-READING No matter how long you've been together, the Golden Rule is: Do not think he can read your mind the way you can read his.  NEEDS Remeber to be good to yourself, then be good to him. That's what love is about, after all. Will this make him happy? Will this make him sad? Will he enjoy this? Consider his feelings. This doesn't mean you should forget about yourself. But he should be right up there too.  Be very attentive to his needs, that way he learns to do the same for you.  Be sensitive to his needs, physically and of course emotionally.  PRIORITIES If one says its important, then it is!  Prioritize each other over friends, extended family, or work.  PRIVACY Have personal space. Allow each other a private moment or two as needed.  RESPECT Create a strong sense of respect for him and yourself. That way you will always treat each other well. That should never change from Day One.  RIGHT REASONS TO BE TOGETHER If you can picture yourself growing old with him, then he's The One!  You can't bear being apart from each other. You want to grow old together, have children, and be the best you can be for each other/ You want to make short and long term goals togetherm or you want to fulfill each other's dreams or just make each other happy!  SELF-ESTEEM Work on your self esteem. If if you're ok with yourself, you will deem your partner as ok too and that improves the relationship. When you bring  whole person to the relationship, you have more to give and have less emotional needs.  SEX Be sexually adventurous. Make each other feel comfortable sharing your sexual fantasies and frustrations.  Lots and lots of sex! Being physical really keeps couples interested in each other. Make an effort all the time!  SPACE Give each other space. Even couples who seemed joined at the hip need theit time to themselves. Have dates with your friends and give him is dates with his friends as well. If you can't trust each other with this, don't be together.  SORRY Be able to say sorry when you're wrong.  SURPRISES No matter how long you've known each other, be open to surprises, both good and bad!  TALK Communicate through dialogue. This is an essential ingredient in successful, long relationships. Goos communication is almost a science as entire seminars have been devoted to this topic. Dialogue lets you tackle issures by sharing your feelings without judgments or criticism, active listening, then working up to a discussion for problem solving. Its not easy. It takes continuous effort and learning.  Tell each other stories. Life goes by pretty fat, and it's easy to see how easily couples can grow apart. Whenever something funny, scary, exciting, or juicy happens to you or someone you know, tell him about it. And have him do the same. Keep each other in the loop of life, even by e-mail or phone talk if you have to.  TEAMWORK Think for two and work as a team. Consult each other before making big decisions because everything will always affect the both of you.  Strengthen couple power. In many cases, we have to decide based on what is best for the relationship in favor of our individual selves. No need to fear losing out individuality when we do this if our self-esteem is intact.
