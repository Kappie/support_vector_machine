It's a great magazine as it always has been except for what I've noticed recently. For one, there has been a major cut down in the size of the magazine and second, the magazine seems more based on technology companies rather technology itself. None of this has been immediate but a gradual stepdown to what seems to me, a lower quality magazine. I've pulled out all of the Wired magazines I own (except for the ones my brother has stoled and is keeping in Tempe), dating from January 2000 to the latest, June 2004. The issue  Millenium-Free Zone  (January 2000) has a page number count of two hundred forty-eight but the issue  Fast Forward  (December 2000) has a page number count of four hundred eighteen. In two thousand two Wired got a make over in an attempt to appeal to a larger crowd. Dave Weber, who runs the Management of Technology program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests Wired "may be guilty of 'jack of all trades and master of none disease." Wired's own Chris Anderson said "Wired has become less evangelical, less political ... less about looking at the subcultures and more looking at technology's effect all around us." at a redesign promotion. No more twelve page articles on the idea of growing massive amounts of ocean plankton with the vitamin Fe to solve the issue of global warming or pushing the acceleration on a roller coaster from zero to eighty in one and eight-tenths of a second. Today, I'm reading articles on Peter Jackson, the director of  The Lord of the Rings , and what the great features of Google are and how to use them. There are exceptions to these issues but Wired just isn't what is used to be, it's not "out there." Will my subscription be renewed? We'll all see in December.  Oh by the way, in the words of Ryan Adams I say "Note to self, don't die."
