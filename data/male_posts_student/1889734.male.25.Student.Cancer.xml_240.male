It seems he blasted Cheney for his 'secret' energy meetings, while he has a history of holding the same sort of meetings while Governer of Vermont.  I'm not surprised.  The point isn't secrecy.  It might be appropriate for both Howie and Cheney to have some secrecy in these meetings, to protect the participants and allow a free ranging discussion of policy with no limits to what might be said.  But of course, a charge of hypocrisy will never stop a devoted Leftist from bringing down a republican.
