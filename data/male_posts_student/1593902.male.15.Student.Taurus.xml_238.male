Cait and I were alone in the kids section of Barnes n Noble, and she finds some lush of a turtle hooked on some book and a lonely cat and introduced them, quality. Cait and Michelle acting like morons, forthose of you that don't know them is like having like 9 natalies around ya. (attractive too!)  So me and Kurt act like we don't know them while reading ( Sports Illustrated).  So while thier acting like a zoo and we're reading a litte kid who's like....4? comes up to us and goes, football! (he's wearing a canes cap, like me-for ahir reasons bleh) tw'as funny, he notices michelle and cait and sits down to listen to them (so they go from going i'm dead sexah for a tutrtle! to kindergarden language, then some little girl sits down, this was the enterainment for a good half an hour till we go see the movie.   The terminal was damn good. Me and michelle fucked around the hole time (and Kurt and Cait). Then the damn women turn on us, I whisper some rude comment about C. Zeta Jones in Kurt's ear and Mich busts out with "AWWWWW what a cute couple!" for the rest of the night we got called gay by some guy behind us. So kurt, being the CAit pleasing foo that he is ;p HOLDS MY HAND, right in front of the dude as we're leaving. Class jokes followed after that including this exhange:  Cait: Awwwwww Kurt: Shut up turtle Franco: I feel abused and wrong Michelle: Why are me and caitlyn intruding on you boys. Kurt: Look it's the green pussy connection   After that movie, me and kurt argue. Why? Because we went to the bathroom in two's to make fun of the two girls, and i stupidly go you and cait should date. he gets angry (and all the erason goes to him) Cause hes liked cait for years, and yet me and her dated, and hes trying NOT to cross that line of "dating best friends ex". Then he dropped the bomb on us, While we're eating at Johnny Rockets ( I pulled a Brandy and snuck a couple of fries off of Cait) and a milkshake, he tells us he's moving to Broward.  Fuck, there goes that then.   Me and my boyfriend have broken up shit.  Kurt, Cait shut up lol  Damn, that means it's gonna be a lot more of Aventura mall for me.   Whic is awesome cause i've been annoying you people for like a year to let's go hang out at the rain forest cafe thing over there  anyways, i had fun, the ride back was awesome, cait didn't fit so she lays down on all three of our laps, and we all hold her and tickle her, woman almost pissed herself and her dad kept shooting me and kurt "DON'T YOU DARE!" looks the whole time. Her sister was screaming o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o sexy! (she's 11, why does hse soudn like me!) for like 5 mins.   I love hanging out wiht these people, the only time i don't feel like the third wheel is with them, i mean look at the group, my ex, another ex, and my longest guy friend (cait shush lol).  **thinsk about michelle and her turtle turtle deal**  Twas a good night.   Shayan- I'm not gay.   Seriously.  Cait- shut up.
