If you wanna have a look through my favorite pictures, just go straight to  urlLink this  link.  I had taken to being a little strick on my favorite pictures/icons/etc, but I decided not to and to just get basically everything I liked favorited. So, if you want to know what kind of stuff I like, just go through and check it out. I haven't gotten to go through all the catogories, so I might never get to some since it's so large a site. I'm not currently subscriped, but that doesn't matter. I might start posted some of my digital camera pics on there.  Anyway, that's all. Back to reading my book and working on the church site ( urlLink www.firstbaptistdayton.org )
