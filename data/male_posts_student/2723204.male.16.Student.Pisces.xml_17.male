I went for a camp, and I just came back. It really has taught me alot. Not the programmes or anything, but because one girl from my class got knocked down by a van, she's ok now, no internal injuries, it is mainly superficial, fractures in the arms and pelvic bones mostly, and pretty major fractures, i must add.  I saw the whole process, the whole process, everything. I did not dare to go see the state she was in when she was on the road, but all i could feel that is she was in immense pain, immense............the worst part was that she was conscious too. Her friends were crying, her close friends....................tabby, lin, clara.......and i must add, even though I hardly talk to her and all, i still do feel something..............to see my own classmate get knocked by a van.....................Here's a poem i composed for her...........    The strongest girl who ever lived      The scent of jubilance saturates the morning air,  And the birds, their chirps, based on a major. I saw you, quiet and reserved, just as ever. Up the bus you went, not knowing what a fate it might deliver All this while, a love for you, in our hearts it hid For we would never have realized how much you mean to us, till the day, the van, it sped.  But I hope you realize our desire,  Our desire to share this burden with you, to lessen this pain for you Our love we no longer want to hide, For all we want you to do is to continue to fight.  Our class would never be complete without you. Our hearts will forever exist a vaccum only you could fill. For we know of your bravery, we have witnessed your courage. We know you do not want us to shed a tear for your sake. But we're sorry, this wish, we could never fulfill. Please be strong, Lynette, please get well soon. For only with your return, will our hearts keep still..........
