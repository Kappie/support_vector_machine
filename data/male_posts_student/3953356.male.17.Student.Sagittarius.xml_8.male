Over le weekend I had two weddings to work at! The first one I was there for 13 hours till 4 in the morning!!! And it went ok. The cake tasted nice!!! And I found a sobre Irish man!!!!! RARITY!! Although he got drunk about 5 minutes later!!! Second day I had to stand in the ceromony!!! The only wedding I've been to and I didn't know anyone there! And I swear the groom was gay because he was the biggest ABBA fan!!!! How could you marry that? Anyway that cake wasn't as nice. A fruit one. I met a few Polish people, one called Mya and she was manly! One called Bart, he was funny! And one called something but he looked like Marco from BB!!!!! It was so funny darling! Anyway I must reply to a message I got from the scuzzyness that is Lauren! TTFN
