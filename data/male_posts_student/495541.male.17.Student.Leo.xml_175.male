The second half of the day I spent reading a complete chapter in my World History book and typing notes on it.  By the way you can print them off too because I'm super nice and I posted them on my site.   urlLink Chapter 18 Notes   If you're the kind of person, like me, who waits until the last second to study for a test... Or doesn't even study at all, I wouldn't suggest just scanning these notes.  From what I see on the study guide, the test doesn't look all that easy.  I think it helps to reread the chapter and make your own notes.  But that's just my opinion.  But other than that, mostly today was nothing big.  I did though, watch a bit of C-SPAN on TV.  It's interesting the things they talk about and what they talk about.  I was watching the House talk about authorizing naming a post office building after a post office employee died.  May sound boring, but was interesting, I think.  Maybe tomorrow, I will actually get homework done the same way I did today.  Lets hope so.   Listening to:  - "Coldplay - Trouble (Live)"
