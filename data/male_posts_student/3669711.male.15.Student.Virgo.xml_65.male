Yesterday, i went over to my nephew, BJ's, house. We had planned to go to Rogers to rent a game or two, and right when i got there, i was greeted by him and his mom in the driveway, waiting for me to go to Rogers.  We casually walked into Rogers and found two games we liked (well, one he liked and one i liked) and they were Summer Beach Volleyball for the PS2, and Kirbys Air Ride for Gamecube.  Then we wanted to go and buy pizza, but his mom was in a hurry, so she gave us money, and then drove away.  Well, the pizza place wasn't open yet, so we waited around for a while... and it still continued to be closed.  We got tired of waiting and walked to the nearby Mcdonalds and got lunch there.   After we walked back to his place, we played the volleyball game for a while and then we headed over to his friends house to watch Eurotrip.  Eurotrip has to be one of the funniest yet dirtiest movies i have ever watched.  I laughed so hard at some parts, but was discusted at others... parts i wish i hadn't have seen.  Nothing i can do about it now.  You might wonder: Whats your favourite part?   Well, i was thinking and my favourite part was right at the beginning when Scotty got a new email from Mikea and his computer told him this by saying "Mail fo the f*cker" in a distinctly "black" tone.  All of us cracked up, and then we all said we wanted alerts like that.  It was great!   Anyways, after we finished the movie, we went back to my nephews place, and played some Turok: Evolutions (worst game ever) and some Air Ride (another bad game) and ended it off with some volleyball (fun game ^_^ and not just because of the girls).  And when we were in about the 3rd out of 6th tournament in volleyball, i had to go!   I also watched 007 James Bond: Live and Let Die, and i can positively say that that was the WORST Bond movie that i have EVER seen in my entire life.  Well, atleast i can say now that i've seen them all ^_^.   Today, besides go to Church in the morning, i played some more Metal Gear.  I am on the second disc right now, right after beating Sniper Wolf for the second time.  All i can say is that i hate the lava in the... hot place... can't think of it's proper name...  too bad.  Well,  i think this is long enough!  Blog ya later (that was endlessly corney...)  Lates
