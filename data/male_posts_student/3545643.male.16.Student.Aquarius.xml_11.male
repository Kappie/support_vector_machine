If you have some suggestions for what should hapen in the future, feel free to speak up, cuz i dont know where the story is going.   Red on black  Chapter 1  She always was the smartest, and the best looking, though she tried to hide it. I can remember, if I can remember correctly, she use to sit in the back of my math class, alone. She rarly spoke, and when she did it was only to answer a question or proving the teacher wrong. Hah she was quite an interesting girl.  When lunch came around she would always sit alone at the table near the window, drawing. She would wear her thick, beautiful redish-brown hair over her face, trying to hide it I guess, and I could never figure out why she did. If you could catch a glimpse of her face the first thing tha catches your attention is her eyes. Ho man she had probably the most beautiful eyes you have ever seen. Almost impossible to descripe, for hours on end I have tried to figure out what colour they really are but never have. They are like a golden green, but its not that simple. He skin is perfect, absolutly perfect, she has the right emount of colour, and yet still is not too dark, just.. wel perfect. Then her lips... When you see her lips you think of yours touching hers, clear right then and there. Always forming a small smile, like she has just been told a joke that isn't funny, but still smiles.  She truly is stuning
