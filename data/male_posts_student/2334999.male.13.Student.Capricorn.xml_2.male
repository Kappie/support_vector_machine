At first it hanged cos i was cheating then after I changed the settings back to normal, everything else did so too :D But I still cant belive that my video card (ATI Radeon 9200) is SOOO bad that I have to play PT on 640x480 settings... Of course I changed it to 1024x780 at the expense of some lag but I was using night vision goggles most of the time so there wasnt much of a difference. Then I went to play Condition Zero online...The first time since I bought it in April (or was it may?) Not much of a difference actually. It was the same as 1.6 but you could pick up grenades in this one :D And the maps and weapon models just looked different. Oh and the sound too. Overall, it was THE SAME!!! Played that the whole afternoon. And now (its @ nite now), im talking to roderic. Hes being an ass (as usual) spamming and talking crap. A'well, gnite... Im gonna watch The Simple Life in like 15 minutes.
