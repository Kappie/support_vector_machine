We played some pool and spent a lot of time shouting at people and other random crap. It was a good night and I had a good time... laughed a lot! This morning I had a raging headache but went straight to Mandy's and spent the day with her. It was such an amazing day. Sunny and clear, we decided to go for a walk through this really nice countryside(ish) place. Really enjoyed that. And now I am sat at home listening to Hanson! Hahaha! But this song is having some kind of effect on me! It's so uplifting and the musical harmonies are incredible! A lot of people are gonna be shocked at this! Ah well. I am kinda getting used to my hair now and I really like it. I am glad I cut it. It was hard to do but I have no regrets. There are some pictures at  urlLink www.faceparty.com/slow_chemical  =)
