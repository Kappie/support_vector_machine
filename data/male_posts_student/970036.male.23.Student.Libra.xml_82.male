Upon returning home from work this afternoon, I'll be diving head-first into an Anthropology of Religion take-home final exam/paper, which is worth an impressive 40% of my final grade in the course. My experience with Sociology and Anthropology is that Anthropology has turned out to be what I thought Sociology was about, and Sociology has turned out to be something resembling  quantum mathematics  and  infinintesimal algebraic theory . While enjoying both, it tends to be with Anthropology that my literary skills of bull-shitism and wild, unfounded, and imaginative declarations vexes the instructors into assigning me a high grade.  Having said that, though, I had a uniquely unexpected experience before writing a final exam this morning. As the professor was handing out the exam, he brought up the grades for our term project (the one I handed in on Monday after staying awake for over 30 hours) and was polite enough to announce that I had received the highest grade  and  received a  monetary  award for my proficiency! Never before have I received money from a professor for a job well done; bribes tend to flow from student to teacher, as I understand it. It was also unsettling, because it took a good 10 minutes before my elation cleared and I was able to actually focus on writing the exam at hand.  So, as I type this in the confines of Nicole and I's new, unsettled apartment, I'm enjoying a cold beer on the patio and pat on the back for continuing the reversal of a post-secondary education that was formerly beyond abysmal.
