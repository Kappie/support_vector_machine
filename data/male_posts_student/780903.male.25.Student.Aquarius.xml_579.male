Too obvious, but I have to start somewhere.  We pay them for power, they didn't deliver.  An open and shut case.  2. The government.  Under the takings clause.  They took my power away.  So there.  3. McDonalds.  If people weren't so fat, they wouldn't need as much electrical power to cool their extra-large houses with extra large door frames, to power their extra-large microwaves, to light their extra-large bodies, to run their extra-large clothes-stretching machines in their closets.  And because McDonalds is the cause of obesity, they are clearly liable here.  4. Class action suit against the news media on behalf of African-Americans.  Why the heck is it called a *black* out?  Everything bad is always Black.  Black plague, Black Monday, black eye, black lung, black market, black sheep, blackout.  Whiteout is a helpful little paint that covers up mistakes.  Blackout is a calamitous loss of electricity that causes all sorts of crappy things.  We should sue the news media for perpetuating this racist term.  5. Microsoft.  My computer was running about a dozen different Microsoft programs when it crashed, including a few I'm sure I've never even heard of.  Clearly there must be some connection.  (And, besides, think Deep Pockets!)  6. Paul Newman.  His salad dressing went bad in my refrigerator.  Why can't he make shelf-stable dressing?  Bad man.  Bad, bad man.
