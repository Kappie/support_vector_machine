It was over one month late, but at least it was Christmas quality snow; nice and thick, like you can roll it into snowballs.  Talking of snowballs, one of our teachers was telling off some 12 year olds for throwing them at each other, saying, "I don't expect this behavior!". I just thought, "What? You don't expect 12 year olds to throw snowballs at each other on the first day in like 100 when it's snowed? Get real!"  Well I'm feeling  really  hungry right now, so I have to go otherwise my stomach will implode or something. Maybe.
