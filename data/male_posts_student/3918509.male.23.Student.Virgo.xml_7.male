America is now joined by another major world player in refusing to buy into the UN's lie that Kyoto will reduce global warming.  Russia and America recognize that Kyoto will cost billions in lost economic growth while having a miniscule impact on global warming.  No one is even sure whether global warming is man-made or simply a trend concurrent with the end of the last ice age.  Kyoto is global governance clothed in junk science.  Michael Crichton (author of such books-turned-movies as Jurassic Park and Timeline) recently spoke on the subject of religious environmentalism in a  urlLink speech  delivered to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco.  Crichton correctly observes that for many urban Americans environmentalism has become an emotionally driven religion built upon a bundle of myths with no scientific basis.
