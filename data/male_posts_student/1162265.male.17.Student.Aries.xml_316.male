Julia, I hadn't actually meant that incident in particular (because it was a drop in the pond) but hell I already talked to you online.  Hard to express in words.   Worked fuckin' 7 fuckin' hours today.  Cleared out a damn house.  I try not to have any anger at Lauren for being at all involved in the closing on this house, but it's really pissing me off.  It's bad enough she's taken an 'extended vacation' from school, and her boyfriend/fiance/husband's family is where her life is now, but the least she could do was help clean up her own damn stuff!  Maybe I'm just tired.  Song just changed to KRS-ONE's "Get yourself up".  'How you think you free when you act like property?' Great line.  SATII US History is a must take for anyone who took the AP US test, it'll be a sinch.  Speaking of AP US I have my work cut out for me in that class, not to mention my letter for Robles this weekend, and Lit. Journalism for McGrane.  If it's the end of the year, why do I not feel happy?  Song changed again.  Askari X's (Soldier X) "Ward of the StateII" one of my favorite songs.  "...and the tears that I wiped away from the eyes of my mother and my woman every time they cried.  When it's they finally said goodbye at the end of my visit, and I wonder what is it, that keep a young brother like me...."  Oh, good news though.  I got money for working, 10 dollars an hour, but besides that I have more money coming in! I got the job at the summer program, 2nd year working there.  Hopefully I'll get stationed at Cameron, because it was awful odd being so young and the only guy doing the preschool.  Although now that I'm seventeen (and can 'legally' buy games rated M and see NC-17 movies) I somehow feel like I'm sooooooo much older, even though I'm really not.  I don't even have a liscense!  So, I guess that managed to brighten my day.  Okay, I could recollect, or I could ramble.  Samone has lime disease,  que triste .  I realized I really really really can't stand black religious people.  I can deal with it in church, because it's a place where the disease (too much Snow Crash!) is actually spread and I need to spend my own time resisting it, but at lunch for example:  Frosh:   Anyone want a Velocity [magazine]? Dan  Greg: Nah, don't have any money. Me: Hold on sounds interesting... Dan: Here we go again... Me: How much is it? Frosh: One dollar.   Here you go.    Me:   Bad grammar... Too [tree-hugging] liberal... Dan: Can I see?     See I agree with President Bush on the gay marriage thing but I'm still a democrat.  WHY THE HELL ARE BLACK PEOPLE SO BLIND!!!!!!! This guy has watched Lesbian pornos before, what guy hasn't?, and he has the nerve to say 'Being gay is wrong'.  I couldn't even bring this up, I wasn't trying to hold back the urge I had at that moment to bore half (actually more then half) of the Christian garbage (granted not all of Christianity is garbage, but that's true of all religion) out of his head with a broken snapple bottle.  Actually that's not true at all, but needless to say I'm dumbfounded by how powerful Christian evangelist (which is the polite word for zealots/fundamentalist) can actually think (do they think?) these type of things.  I better back down.  I'm no atheist myself, nor do I see any wisdom in being one.... I'm so religiously confused I guess I just gave up.  Sorry to all the really Christian people who read this.
