But i will have to cope.   Sooo, whats new.  i dunno.  the other day, I was put in this group with a girl on exchange, so i ask where she is from, holland.  oh, from rotterdam? yea.  Oh, do you know wieteke? oh, of course.  maybe its normal over there in europe, what with all your inbred erasmusness, but it was quite a surprise for me here in Canada.  So, I undertook it as my civic responsibility to show her around the city.   I went out with all her exchange student friends and... lets just say you are lucky you didnt come here on exchange, haha, they all seem like losers. except for a few of course.  but it made me think how lucky we were to have such a great group of people.  really.   I wonder what the current batch of girrie cookies look like now.  Adam - eagerly awaiting pictures.  Everyone else, by the way, please put up some fotos from your home country, It would be great to see where everyone comes from.  If you want to its pretty easy, just send me an email for instructions.    Well folks. hoped you were all thoroughly bored by my post.  i dont know, there is something kinda theraputic about this isnt there?  anyways, gotts ta go, see you later amigos  Walker
