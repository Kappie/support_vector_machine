I really do, but when they have absolutely nothing to do for days at a time, other than pick fights with each other and ask me the 3 same questions over and over and over again.. 1) Can I hold my hamster?! 2) Can I hold Matthew's Hamster? 3) Can Matthew/Laith/KiKi/Jenna come over? (all asked in rapid succession). Arrgghhh!! I'm signing the boys up for fall soccer on Saturday and then signing them up for July "Pal's in the Park". Pal's will get them out of the house MWF's through July from 9-12pm. Soooo maybe that will help them. Jamie had a really good week last week because he had soccer camp and he was pretty easy. *Crossing fingers* Sunday is Jamie's birthday. He'll be *gasps* 7! I can't believe. His party is Saturday night. He's invited some of the neighborhood kids over to watch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets with him. They are all supposed to come dressed as their favorite character. He's invited 7 children, but 2 of them, so far, aren't coming. That's because, Ellie, gets very scared. When Jamie said what he wanted to do, I knew that she and her brother, Dawson, probably wouldn't be able to come. Hopefully, though, the rest will show up. Unlike last year when only 2 kids out of his 24 in his classroom showed up for his party at Chuck E Cheese. It was really sad:( But, thankfully he didnt really notice or if he did, he didn't let on.  This morning, I was getting the kids dressed and fixed Sarah's hair and brushed Matthew's. Well, Jamie has a new haircut. We went to the beauty shop the other day and he went through 2 THICK hairstyle books looking for his new hairstyle:) It took him a good 30 minutes to mull over the pages and find just the right style:) Our 7 yr old now requires hair products (gel) for his hair! Oi vey.  Anyway, back to this morning... Jamie has now decided he will be sporting a mohawk:) His hair is longer on top so it's very easy to do it up down the center and well.. he did:) Melia teased me saying, next thing I know, he'll be wearing all black and coming home with piercings!! NOOO! *sighs* I called Paul and he said, "I don't think so":):) And so it begins....:) I think I'll post a picture of Jamie's new 'do'. He's got allergies or something because his eyes are all puffy and squinty. In all of the pics I took of him this morning, he looks either drunk or is blinking. Anywhoo:) Here are some pics:)    urlLink    Matthew urlLink      urlLink    Jamie mohawk urlLink      urlLink    Sarah urlLink     take care ~kat:)
