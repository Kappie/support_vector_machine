Anyhoo, I will skip this morning. It's quite boring la. I went online, after that ate lunch and watched TV.  Yes. I am late in meeting Gloria. VERY late. How can blame me? I am..er...clearing my bowels. Too much info, I think. Yes. Then I spent 5 minutes finding my pants!!! My pants were put in my brother's closet!! Ergh! I rushed to meet Gloria, the the rest at Woodlands.   Yes. Me, Gloria, Joyce, CQ, Hann and KS are all going to KBox at Lot 1. Heh. We met Yih Fei's group in Lot 1. Yes!  KBox was meowing and mooing. Well, I sang relatively few songs, and I sang badly. Yeah. I spent most of the time walking round or staring at people sing. I once slept there. Until they woke me up that is.   Hmm. Quite meowing la, I must say. I paid $14.60 for the K Box. So +++=$4.60!! After that, we went home. I ate instant noodles for dinner then I went online. Actually, that's pretty inaccurate. I ate dinner while online.   Hmm. There was an conspiracy. Ayiah. Cannot reveal here. See what happens when your blog has a huge readership? You cannot write a lot of stuff. Heh.   Right. I gotta get going. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
