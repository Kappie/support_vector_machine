       
      My work is dull. It's not that I dislike my job, I just wish it wasn't so boring. It feels like when I'm working my mind can just go away for a while, go read a book or something while my body does the tedious job of putting books away.  But I don't work again untill Tuesday, so I'm good for now. And now I'm going to dinner.
