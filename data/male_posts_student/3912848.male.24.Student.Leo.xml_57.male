Hopefully I'll be able to adapt to the new format without too many SNAFU's.  I like the plug for mathematics up there on the headliner.  Once the Big D joins the fun, you can add laziness.     Lately I have been listening to a lot more talk radio.  Whether the topic is sports or politics, the switch on my receiver has been lodged in the little used AM position.  I guess that I am getting fed up with hearing  Slow Ride  and  Black Dog  all the time on my classic rock stations.  One can only listen to those same tunes so many times.  Talk radio offers something fresh every day, and helps to keep me awake while I'm driving to and from Birmingham (where I teach my calculus course).  Here is a brief list of programs that I have been tuning in to.     urlLink Jim Rome , 1-3PM.  Rome is a nationally syndicated show that runs from 9:00AM-12:00PM PST.  My local station only carries the last two hours.  Rome is fun to listen to as he'll work in other aspects besides sports into his show.  The best parts of the show are when he is off on some soliloquy about an issue or certain e-mails that fans have sent.      urlLink Bill "Huge" Simonson , 3-6PM.  Huge is a Michigan sports guy whose show operates out of Grand Rapids.  He has about seven affiliates across the state, and his popularity is growing.  He also works current events well into his show, and he is pretty conservative.  Huge tells it like he sees it.     urlLink Rush Limbaugh , 12-3PM.  Y'all know who Rush is and what he's about.     urlLink Michael Medved , ???.  I discovered Michael Medved on the way to teach in Birmingham.  One day I was falling asleep at the wheel, and I found his show while scanning the AM band.  Medved, a hard line conservative, mainly gets callers who disagree with him, and he takes on their questions.  He usually has really good rebutal to anything thrown his way.  The debate always wakes me up and makes sure I live to see the next day.  He's a real life saver.  That's all that I really listen to.  Sometimes I catch Sean Hannity, but not too often.  I also will listen to this liberal Italian guy on Detroit radio every once in a while to hear what liberal radio sounds like.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I always enjoy a good radio show.  Please, no suggestions for NPR.  I already get enough goading for that from my buddy from Germany.    Good to be on board here.
