A few historical events: crusades, inquisition, holocaust, bombings in mideast, September 11, and there is more. b) hypocritical: religion is very contradictory, especially Christianity. Christians supposedly believe in tolerance, yet they oppose gays. The Bible says "thall shall not kill" yet there were and are many wars going on. Jesus preached forgiveness, yet nobody forgives anybody. Who forgave Clinton for getting blown? It is still an issue. Clinton, if you're reading this, which i doubt cause I'm not getting many hits, I FORGIVE YOU. MOVE ON   c) impractical. Religion does not fit in today's world. I'm not against believing in god, I'm against wasting your money on corrupt, child-molesting priests, and on a system that is old-fahsioned and political. d) censorhsip: this one pisses me off the most. All these self-righteous religious groups are preaching about morality and decency. If you want decency: FUCK OFF. Take some responsibility and teach your kids. Howard Stern is not to blame if your kid is fucked up: YOU ARE. And Janet Jackson's tit slip was blown out of proportion. I mean you see tits in biology books. What's the big deal? ALL CENSORSHIP IS WRONG      In conclusion: all you religious INTOLERANT groups out there can kiss my "immoral" ass. It is up to US to choose OUR path in life, not yours. so fuck off.
