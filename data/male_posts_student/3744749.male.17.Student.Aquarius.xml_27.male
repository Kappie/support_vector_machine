The events of last night are beginning to fuck with me, which wasn't helped by mind numbing boredom. I have been so bored all night I am stooping so low as to turn to posting as a form of entertainment. I forgot books and can't think of anything to draw...smek. I need me some funning. "Funning" and "broughten", the literal manifestation of how bored I am. Ugh...I suck. This blog thing has gone too far.   I spent the last 45 minutes sitting in nearly complete darkness watching unknowing dinner party goers pee while listening to a barely audible Looney Toons theme song loop endlessly. Its funny how much noisier people are in the bathroom when they don't think people are in earshot. Yeah. I'm creepy. Chortle.  My codemnation to this wretched place is due to my mother's recent doubt in my ability to be out in the late hours of the night and NOT get arrested. At dinner, I was forced to leave the table when conflicting views of pepper, and to what foods it is appropriate to be applied to, clashed. I don't really blame my mom for reprimanding me. Although it is somewhat of a blow when your mother thinks you are a delinquent, which isn't entirely untrue...But thats not the point! The point is not being able to do anything ain't cool. I'm not sure how much longer i will be branded a crimin-imi-NAL that habitually breaks every law humanly possible. Actually I really should be relieved the expected tsunami of rage never came. Wow. I am not learning my lesson at all. Can you say "repeat offender". Hello federal pound me in the ass prison.
