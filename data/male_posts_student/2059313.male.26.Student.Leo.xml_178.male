He wanted to know if I was interested in Designing one of the shows.  Of course I said, Yes.  Unlike my designs in the past, this one will be the first that I'm actually paid specifically for.  I'll be getting a designer's fee on top of my pay that I get for being the Master Electrician.  Very exciting times! Very exciting!  The summer is too far away.
