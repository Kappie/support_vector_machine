I got to be with my dad on his birthday and I also got to have lunch with 3 old friends from my first high school whom I had not seen in about 4 years.  ["Tequila Sunrise," Eagles, 1976] It's just amazing to me that despite how much we've all changed we all continued to act around each other the way we did at Krum, horsing around, making fun of each other, and having a great time. ["Pink Moon," Nick Drake, 1994] Will McKnight is actually living in Fort Worth now. He recently bought a house and is now working at Lockheed Martin. I was really glad to hear that he is living so close, I had no idea before this weekend. Krista Wright.....er...Roseland is living in Killeen and is anxiously awaiting her husband's return from Iraq. She is working in the speech therapy program at an elementary school. Krista was the one who gave me my first bit of motivation to apply to TAMS, something that literally changed my life for the better. Nicolle Bowling is engaged I think and is working in accounting/marketing for the Farmers  Merchants State Bank in Denton. She is full of so much energy. Her and Krista are really the life of the party while Will and I just kinda look at each other and shake our heads in laughter as we watch the hilarity unfold before us.  ["Harvest," Neil Young, 1972] Another test this wednesday, so I'd better be going. September 11th is coming up again. Where were you when you heard the news? I was coming out of physics class at Duke returning a page I had gotten from my dad. My dad never usually pages me during the day, so I knew something wasn't right. He told me on the phone what had happened and I quickly joined the hundreds of shocked students in the Bryan Center as we looked at the tv screens in disbelief.   Recommended song: "That I Would Be Good," Alanis Morissette, 1999.
