When I first got there, Mary was in a meeting and Laurie told me that she wanted me to paint a wall in the hallway leading to her office.  But I was only to paint up till about 7 feet high.  I panicked a little on the inside, since painting is a big gig and you can't just go and ruin someones floor, or lightswitch, or wall molding because ur not careful.  But I got over it, painted the wall without a hitch, and I cleaned the brushes and wrapped up the plastic floor covers and removed the tape from the wall moldings and whatnot.  Then a few minutes later, Mary came back from her meeting and before she went to her second meeting she said, "Oh could you paint these two as well?  Good job!" It was at this point that I learned Lesson #1: Don't pack up the paint materials unless you're absolutely sure that you are through painting.  So I painted the two other walls and it looked good.  Then Mary and her co-worker came back from their meetings.  They commented on how much better the walls looked and debated whether I should do the top halves of every wall.  Mary won, and I was to paint the top halves.  Now, these walls are easily 13 or 14 feet high.  So that meant I had to lug a 10 foot or so ladder into this cramped ass, hot hallway.  The top halves took me quite a while.  I was sweating so much.  On my third to last wall, once I climbed to the top, the ladder started to slide closed!!!  As the latter legs slowly inched together, my mind started racing.  First I decided to be very still and hope it stopped closing.  When it continued to close, I started worrying about falling and then Mary thinking I'm incompetent.  Finally I decided to climb down really gently.  I did that and luckily I didn't fall.  It was at this point that I learned Lesson #2: Make sure that your fucking ladder is opened all the way before you climb up the bitch.  Anyways, I finished my walls and cleaned my brushes and shit  around 3:00--time to leave.  Mary's been warming up to me, we joked quite a bit today.  Emily also called her mom today, who is Mary by the way.  After that phone call, Mary called me downstairs and she was with a couple of her colleagues.  They told me that they had heard that I do good impressions, and they made me do a little--tres embarrassing! :-\  But it was funny.  THANKS Emily.  Anyways, my job is fun as hell, even if it takes a lot of finesse and heat endurance.  I don't want to see paint again for a long time.
