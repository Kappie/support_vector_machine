I felt that the characters weren't very interesting. They were bland... but if it wasn't the intriguing story that Dumas wrote... it would have been less than alright. I wouldn't say crappy, because, for whatever reason, I can't hate historical fiction / period movies. Something that crossed my mind was how someone that I was telling Laine about last night really wanted to see that movie... it's funny how music and movies can really place your memories on the timeline of your life.   Man... I helped someone with their article and I didn't even work on my paper today... well technically I did if you count the early morning...  I think I'm gonna get cleaned up, get another beer and get to work on my paper.  ***
