I rearranged the storage closet, in actuallity, I was searching for all the parts to my low-rider manual scooter that I started ages ago. It must be at the father-in-laws casa where the vespas are stored. I did a little painting, I am low on supplies and broke so painting will have to cease for the time being. I can make due with what I have.  I totally abandoned my good eating habits, lots of beer I don't need. It's almost just something to pass the time. I keep thinking, i can go for a jog or ride my bike around town. No matter how many times I want to be alone, I also want to share everything with at least someone. even a jog. I have another appointment with the junior college conselor tommorrow at 9am. I will find out if the classes will transfer to the local four year university and also plan out my semesters. I guess I did do something productive. I started hunting for another job, no tech stuff, just a better 'job.' I sent alot of resumes out for bank tellers, loan officer/processor, customer service rep, medical lab assistant, etc. Maybe something will come around and i can pull my self out of this finacial hole I'm in. Leatha just told me that last night, around 2am, some people were walking back to their apartment and some dude came over and took a leak right under her window. ROFL!!! wow. Musta been drunk.   current mood: geeky current music: The Panthers - Snakes in the Soundsystem
