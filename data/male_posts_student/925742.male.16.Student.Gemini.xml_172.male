He still is a major in the USAF and now Derek's gotta drive him to work in Bellevue almost every day.  Derek's getting an SKS out of it, though.  Derek.... still sux at soul calibur.  Me, I've been playing Jedi Knight 2 as I have never played it before (on the radeon) and I just beat Shadows of Undrentide (the perfect expansion pack!).  Did I mention that I hassled with Qwest for a month to get internet?  Christ!  Sonja's getting married next year.  Eleanor's art gallery (Akar in Iowa City) is getting to be well known in the states and other countries.... she also will be giving me her car.  Which reminds me that I need my permit... I'm so lazy.  I think people will just drive me places..... well... I need to drive myself places.      Like titty bars.
