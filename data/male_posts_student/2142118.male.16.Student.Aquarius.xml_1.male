Only A  OR  B can be true.  in conclusion, there must be absolute truth.  therefore, anyone who preaches that one can reach salvation through more than one path (religion) is a liar.  God is the only way; there can be no other.  Christianity claims to be the only way; it only remains for one either to accept it or reject it.   i have more to say, but it would just be too much... anyone who wants to know more can mail me through the link below... click on my name...
