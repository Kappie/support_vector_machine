I'm guessing you are a lot like me. Perhaps a Good Charlotte hater? I hope so. An inspiration to us all, continue being you!

You have a deep soul. Many people call you mysterious but they just don't know you. You are often alone but shine hope on every one else. People look up to you and call to you for advice. You have been betrayed but you have forgaven them. Your faith in life has made you an inspiration to us all. You are intelligent, quiet, beautiful, and kind. You will become very sucessful.
