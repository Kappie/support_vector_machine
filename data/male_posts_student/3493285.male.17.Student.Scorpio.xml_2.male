It's been 3 hours and the only thing i really have going on today is a 2 hour soccer practice. and then i will probably come back to you. I was mad because all i was doing was watching. I was distraught by the fact that, that is a lot of tv watching. But then i realized something it summer vacation and lounging around watching tv is really what summer is all about. Thank you TV for your entertaining ways. Oh the irony. -Neil
