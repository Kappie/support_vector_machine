So, what it comes down to is which would you prefer. Not which one is better or worse than the other, but which you would prefer. Which would you choose?  I would choose the death of ice. Slow and unrelenting. A soft sleep. Uncomfortable, yes, but euphoric. The thing about being close to death, is that it is a feeling unmatched. There is nothing like it; not cocaine, not heroin, not morphine can top good old death. I choose ice, as the ice will kill you just the same, it will kill you slower. You will spend a greater amount of time lingering around close to that precious light at the end of the tunnel. Ecstatic.    You know...Even this place here is full of hurt.  There are two women. One is 40, well, 39 exactly, but it makes no difference. The other is 35. They are both very sad. I tried to help them. How can I help them when I can barely help myself? Haha, perhaps this is what I've been put here to do. I am a Guardian Angel, aren't I?  The first one, she is quite the exceptional poet. As a matter of fact, most everything she says is so poetic, so melodramatic.  The second one, a victim of the "once bitten, twice shy" syndrome. She made a mistake, and now regrets it more than anything.  It would seem dire straights for the both of them.  This world is so full of hurt.  I have to stop it. How?
