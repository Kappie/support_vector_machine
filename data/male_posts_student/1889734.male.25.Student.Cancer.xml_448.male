Global climate shift would seriously jeapordize our nation, so it is good to know that those who are charged with our defense are ready for it.   As an aside, I do think that it was jsut such a climate shift that was primarily responsible for the collpse of the Roman Empire. Also perhaps for the terrible plauge that thwarted the Byzantine emperor Justinian's attempts to resote the Empire.
