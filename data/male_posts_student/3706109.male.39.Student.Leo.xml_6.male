As I understand it, artificial life is the creation of computer basedentities that attempt to model the biological processes that we experience in our day-to-day lives.By programmingthese computer based entitiesto act /react to cetain behaviors, we can model the possible outcomes ofactual biological elements.    So, what does that mean? Well, Let me try to explain where I am coming from. While I am not ascientist, or a computer geek eitherfor that matter, I am going to try and apply my own little spin on this and hopefully work to explain where I am coming from.    I did a paper at ClarkCollege a couple of years ago that discussed the Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO's).As we all know, GMO's are those little foodscreated in laboratories to make certain elements of the food more attractive, tastier, drought resistant, etc..While doing my research, I found that a big part of this industry is the computer based modeling of certain elements of these food items.By using computer based models to mimic the actual biological growth processes of certain entities, scientists have found that they can eliminatelarge numbers of unlikelycombinations without having to spend the time todevelop thereal-life elements. This saves years in the research process and drastically improvesoverall success factors.     Where did it start and w  hat is the "Game of Life"   Whatever the "Game of Life" is, I'm sure that it started the day I was born and I got one of the crappy versions of the game.    That said,according to information I found at math.com, the "Game of Life" was invented in 1970 by a mathematician named John Conway. After reading through the information provided by the site (  urlLink  http://www.math.com/students/wonders/life/life.html   ), I still do not have an understanding of the purpose of the game and, for me, is probably just Conway's idea of how patterns develop in mathematics and the infinite possibilities that arise as we apply differnt patterns to different situations.
