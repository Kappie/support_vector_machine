She sits there in her skimpy dress, Hair unfurled and in a mess, Only there to impress, With her sexy silhouette.  A youthful boy, of all the guys, Would catch a glimpse of hazel eyes, And suddenly, to no surprise, “Perhaps you'd like a cigarette?”  “If you insist,” a reply would be, “But have a seat here next to me.” An eager face would let her see, His thoughts of her in love.  She'd inch closer, to feel his heat, And slowly make his red heart beat, And there they'd stay, in the lonely street, With voyeur stars above.  She'd bat her eyelashes, and giggle delight, Whisper lovelies in the night, Lightly nibble and gently bite, And promise him her flower.  For thirty minutes, the games they'd play, In that lonesome bus stop sleigh, Until, at last, she'd slowly say, “It's two-fifty for an hour.”
