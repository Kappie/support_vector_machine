Today, school was normal, except that Mr Wong didn't come, so read my book. completed 2 chapters today! There's a sense of satisfaction now. hehe. Also talked a bit with Nat during recess today, ya...got to know some more things about him. And today after school, had sectionals. Wah...very tiring, cause long time didn't practise. Then after sectionals my SL talked to Yiz and me. He say the Sec 3s have to work together now...then he say he's going to pump the Sec 3s clarinetist, cause my silly junior went to wash the clarinet!!!Oh no!!! I'm done for. Just hope he don't give us too much. Haiz...so many papers next week. Hope i do well this CA.
