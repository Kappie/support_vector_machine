So, anyway, they asked me to take them computer shopping. I just love spending other people's money! I set them up with a fancy new HP. This thing has more bells and whistles than I've seen recently and it has been a while since I've even touched a PC so it was an adventure. Windows XP has moved all the controls to places I couldn't find but we eventually got everything going. About 25 critical updates later we had a working machine... I think.   It passed the ultimate test: viewing of  The Matrix  lobby scene. Superb.
