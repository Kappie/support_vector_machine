You know I've never been to a suprise birthday before that? Happy birthday Chris! Oh yeah for those of you who don't know my birthday is on the 26th of this month. *wink, wink* Well I saw this survey on other people's blogs so I figured I'd put it up.   1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says: it doesn't say anything actually it's a manual and it's a blank page right before the next chapter... 2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. wow look at that my arm's in the living room but I'm in the library. 3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?: The TV Guide channel lol :)  4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is:9:45p.m.  5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 9:38p.m.  6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?: P.O.D.'s "School of hard Knocks." and R.C. Sproul. Augh! What's he doing in my living room! 7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?: This afternoon, I was watching Gael wash his Beemer.  8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?: www.efavata.com/CBM its a comic book movie website. Woot woot!  9: What are you wearing?: Jean shorts and a CWSC t shirt.  10: Did you dream last night?: I don't remember.  11: When did you last laugh?: Like an hour ago while watching Daddy Day Care.  12: What is on the walls of the room you are in? A corkboard and bookshelves.  13: Seen anything weird lately?: Kinda, Cortez was like freakin out after he got his bath today. He was just runing and runing in circles it was pretty funny.  14: What do you think of this quiz?: Pretty good.  15: What is the last film you saw?: Daddy Day Care. Ha ha Marvin's the best.  16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: "Guns lots of guns." just kidding that was for Chris. Either a bigger house for my mom or a porsche carrera GT. grrrrowwr...  17: Tell me something about you that I don't know: Ummm... I can't really think of anything. If I think of something I'll have to post it on here later.  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: George Lucas would have done a better job with the Star Wars Prequels. I mean come on "Attack of the Clones"? It's like the night of the living dead or something. Either that or I could use the force. Yeah that would be cool........  19: Do you like to dance?: I would say so. Now the question is "can I dance?"  20: George Bush: is he a power-crazy nutcase or some one who is finally doing something that has needed to be done for years? He's not a power crazy nut case, and he sure as heck is better than our last president plus a few others we've had.  21: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?: Either Mara, Leia or Jaina.  21: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?: Corran.
