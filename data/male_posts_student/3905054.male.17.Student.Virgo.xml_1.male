The salesman said, "Sorry, we don''t sell to blondes."       The next day she came back as a brunette. She asked the salesman how much the TV was. He said, "Sorry, we don''t sell to blondes."       The next day she came back as a red head and asked the salesman how much the TV was. He said, "Sorry we don''t sell to blondes."        She replied, " I came in here as a brunette and a red head. How do you know I am a blonde?"    "Because that is not a TV,  it''s a microwave."
