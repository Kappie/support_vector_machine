Evelyn, Sam, and Amanda are across the hall. Shira, Caroline, Jackie and Nancy are down the hall. When not in class we've been mostly chillin. Done a bit of swimming in the athletic center but that's about it. Hopefully I can get some tennis playing in while I'm here although I'm the only one who brought a racket. Later all.
