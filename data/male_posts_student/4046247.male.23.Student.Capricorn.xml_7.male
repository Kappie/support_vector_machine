I spent part of the weekend working for congressional candidates, to whom I shall give a brief introduction. Mike Fjetland is an independent running against Majority Whip Tom DeLay in Congressional District 22, and his website is  urlLink http://www.fffe.us . John Martinez is a Democrat running against Rep. John Culberson, DeLay's protege, in Congressional District 7, one of the most conservative districts in the country and the seat formerly held by Bill Archer, once chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and, before Archer, by none other than George Bush I  (c'est Ã  dire, par ce premier grand et illustre souverain! ). John's website is at  urlLink http://www.martinez-district7.com/ . I also held a sign up for John Dougherty, who is running for state representative in a district currently held by Martha Wong. See  urlLink http://www.jimfortexas.com/ .       I'm happy to help Mike and both Johns because they are good people who are making honest runs against entrenched candidates. Their opponents (I'm thinking of DeLay and Culberson) are among the worst and most avaricious politicians. Tom DeLay, the architect of the mid-decade Texas redistricting and the most effective opponent of public transportation in America today, is particularly intolerant and closeminded. I can recall how, a few years ago on the House floor, he punched a Democratic member with whom he had had a disagreement over policy.       Indeed, when Mike and I went blockwalking yesterday to pass out flyers, you could sense that, despite his overwhelming victories, DeLay's arrogance is nevertheless resented. One man called to us after we had placed a flyer on his front door, and yelled: "You have my vote! I'm not voting for Tom DeLay!" He was an upper middle class white man with graying hair, in a residential subdivision where I've met quite a few oil industry workers (people who, according to the demographers, elect DeLay). He wanted a word with us. He wanted to say NO MORE DELAY.       Talking to that man -- and getting honked at or "thumbs-upped" by passing motorists (one of whom, named Ted, even got out of his car to chat and learn more about Martinez) when you are holding up a political sign and you begin dancing with it to grab people's attention, right by the intersection of Richmond and Mandell -- makes you realize the importance of putting yourself out and running for office.       Consider this:       We live in a world in which we are automatically isolated from other people, aside from our friends; we move about our cities in routine patterns in cars or in buses, which are bubbles and security cordons in which we ensconce ourselves physically and mentally. In Houston especially, people rarely walk the streets just for the sake of it (they let the heat and the city's expanse win the war). My neighborhood can seem like an uninhabitated ghost town. People don't know how much there is to visit in their own city: the Mexican restaurants on Murphy Road south of Beltway 8, the enormous China town on Bellaire, Hermann Park, the Arab and Indian communities on Hillcroft . . . .      That is why, in my estimation, the writer and the politician, maligned though both may be, at times, for reasons that can be sound (some might say that the former is effete and the latter is corrupt), are unique and important catalysts for our time, who, when sincere, breach the anonymity of modernity and post-modernity. I have to get out on the street, and do something like juggle political signs, for the same reason that I have to go to Panama: the alternative is boredom and a prison of my own making, the prison of routine and sediment, calmly settling down.
