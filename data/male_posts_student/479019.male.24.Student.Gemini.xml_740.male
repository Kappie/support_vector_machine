I paid for the beer at the bar then walked off to the bus stop... I patted my pocket and realized I couldn't find my wallet. I checked ALL my pockets and it was no where to be found!  Then next think I know... I get out of the shower and see my wallet lying on the floor of my apartment.   WTF! this is so weird.   *
