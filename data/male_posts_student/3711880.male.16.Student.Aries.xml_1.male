The first fights were awesome, but now they've turned ugly. And we have the seiyuu's... they suck. Really bad. Aya's voice is creepy, Shin's sounds like a pig, and Bunchichi... let's not talkt about his seiyuu. ANYWAY, the opening really rocks, and I still haven't found the full-version of it.  											I'm going south and then to germany in a week, together with my family. I'm not really in the mood for this, so lets just call it a day. 											 Oh! Great 's the best!
