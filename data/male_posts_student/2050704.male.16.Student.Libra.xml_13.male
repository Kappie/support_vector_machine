So the TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS are leading the ottawa "sucky" senators 2 games to 1 in the best of 7 series. And Eddie Belfour has back to back shutouts in the series, and 4 shutouts in his last 5 games (3 of those against Ottawa). Now with numbers like that, and when your getting shut outs with 37 shots on you in one game, you would think your skilled right? But there are still the goons out there that say "Belfour sucks, hes garbage, the Leafs suck, they are lucky" blah blah blah.  Its simple.  To be good you have to be lucky, its true, its true. And I personally would just like to know how Ed Belfour can "suck" when the guy has like 10 shut outs this year, he is one of the leading shut out leaders of all time, one of the most winningest goalies in the history of hockey, AND has his name on the Stanley Cup. So please find something to convince me otherwise ... BI-ATCH!  Leafs in 5, GO LEAFS GO!
