On top of that, I am hungry and I wont to leave work now but I can't until after 5 o'clock when the next computer room worker shows up. Arrrrrgghh!  Lakers vs Pistons tonight!!!!!!!!! Go Detroit!!!!!!!!!  So I think I will just forget about the extra credit. I don't think I need it anyways. After I eat something later, I might feel up to it.
