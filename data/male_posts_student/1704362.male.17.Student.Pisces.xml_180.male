       
      I really need to find a focus here. I need to find something to write about.  All the really good blogs, they're all  about  something. All I've been able to determine is what this blog  isn't  about. It's not about my life... I really don't see that my life has any discerning qualities to seperate it from other lives.   That, of course, doesn't stop the millions of other people who go into great detail about their incredibly boring, normal lives - but I'm stopped by my obsessive need to be "original." I just wish I could write authoritarively on something - anything, besides these meaningless, inane rants on the nature of this-and-that.  Jimtopia isn't really about anything. That would imply that it's about "nothing," but I can't use that either. (Damn you to the blazes of hell, Jerry Seinfeld).  It's not even about me. I don't feel that this site accurately represents me, as a person, by any measure of accuracy.  On that note, I leave you.      info.link:  urlLink http://zapatopi.net/mindguard.html  how i died today:  urlLink mistaken for a homosexual by rabid lunatic   [Listening to: House of the Rising Sun -  urlLink The Animals  (04:31)]
