If by chance you should disagree with my take on these subjects you are welcome to  shove it  discuss them. I'd like to create a  one-party socialist state  atmosphere conducive to open debate and, as you might have guessed, try not to take things too seriously. That said, I'd like to thank  urlLink Johnny Walker Red  for inspiring this blog, though hopefully my readers won't take him to seriously either :)
