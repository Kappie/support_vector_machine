My eyes are feeling kinda fruity also. I'd like to apoloigise to all those I have confused over the years. many in count. It is rather windy. windig as the germans would say. listening exam tommorrow. i can't listen well. so it should go well. I was supposed to go to town, but i didn't. now i am bored. see you soon.
