I was planning on going to church with my mom, but she didn't come home until 5:00 this afternoon. I don't know where she was. I don't really care though. I was supposed to go out to lunch with Casey today, but turns out we didn't. Molly and I didn't hang out either like we had planned. Turns out, Melanie called and asked if I wanted to go out with her tonight. Carrie, Melanie, Chris and Kendall get here and we leave. We went and just hung out for a while. We took Chris home around 9:00. As soon as we dropped him and Kendall off, Carrie started being a major trick to me. For the past 3 days Carrie has done nothing but be a witch to me. I don't even know why. I know I called Chris a trick on Friday, but I thought we resolved that. I guess not. I don't think I wanna hang out with her for a while, especially without Melanie being there. Melanie is leaving for some kind of dance thing tomorrow. I'm going to miss her a lot. I don't know what I'm going to do without her for a week. Hopefully I will get my license this week and Melanie and I can hang out. I know for sure that Josh and I are going to be hanging out a lot. I love him so much. I know I write that every time, but I don't care. I do love him a lot. I wanna spend the rest of my life with him. I am hoping to take my written test tomorrow. Im kinda excited about getting my license. Well, I'm tired. I'm prolly going to lay down. I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo this week. Well, Later.
