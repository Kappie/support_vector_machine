It wasn't so boring once I got to his house—we watched Along Came Polly and 50 First Dates. That second was was actually kind of sad, but they were both funny and good.  Today I went to the book store on the way to the doctor (for my Dad) and bought a copy of PC World, which I forgot to subscribe to many times before. Then I went to the skatepark ( yay ). I learn something new every time I go there. I can't wait until I get a good job and I live alone—then my parents won't bitch about how I always want to go places. I could just drive myself and some friends up to the skatepark everyday, bitch-free! Oh well, that's probably gonna be at least six years away.  Well, it's about time to go play Counter-Strike and kill some team members!
