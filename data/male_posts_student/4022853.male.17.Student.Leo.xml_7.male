I think im beginning to really care for this person but how to tell her?  I plan to see her friday.  If there was an opportunity to tell her it would be that day.  I still dont know how to tell her.  There's also, the rejection factor.  I've never told someone i've liked them unless i was absaloutly sure they liked me back.  This is different becuase im not sure.  I feel i should wait to tell her how i feel but if i wait too long i might miss the opportunity.  Perhaps i should wait to see if feelings grow stronger between us.  Maybe she doesnt see the connection now but she might see it later.  I dont know.  Everytime i close my eyes i see her smiling face.  I start making up scenarios in my head about friday and i know none of them will happen.  Its still nice to think about though.  I really do wish she likes me back.  Just talking to her makes me feel flushed.  Im afraid though.  If she does like me back what then?  We become boyfriend and girlfriend but still...what then?  I see her a lot...we play guitar...I dont know.  Things may get boring between us.  I dont know.  Maybe things will fall into place.  What if she doesnt like me...and i poor my heart and soul out to her.  What then?  Perhaps this is a friendship that should remain just a friendship.  Perhaps i shouldnt ruin what we've got...but if there is the chance of success...should i take it?  I dont know.  I suppose i should distract my mind if i can, after all this is just another night where I cant sleep.  ...but what if?....
