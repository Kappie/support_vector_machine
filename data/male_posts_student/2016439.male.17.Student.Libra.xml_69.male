It was...um...er...eye-opening?  No, I think I'll do okay, but not stellar (wow, I hate that word).  I'm glad that I at least buckled down and studied for  one  night, but I should have done more.  Oh well.  It's the end of my Junior year and senioritis is already starting to settle in, but do I care?  Way, way, way deep down inside, probably, but me being the superficial person (;-) that I am, I'll just say that I don't.  Wow, 20-page papers in newspaper aren't fun.  Waiting in the library for pages to print out while an impatient librarian paces around the library waiting for you to leave is even less.  I'm glad we got the Colossus completed, but we're really going to have to work on getting the admin., to get off their rears and get us a new computer.  Isn't that within the awesome range of Captain SterLo's powers?  I think so, my friend.  I think so.
