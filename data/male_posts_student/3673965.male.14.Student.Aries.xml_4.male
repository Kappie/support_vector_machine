For those whom don't know what iRO is, it's the asian MMORPG, that asians are currently addicted too, same with the whole world. If you want more information on iRO, here's the link to the urlLink  offical iRO site .  Onward into our discussion, let's go to the whole 3-1 ordeal~!  3-1, also known as Advanced Job Class 2. 3-1 has been recently released to the public, and won't be coming onto iRO and kRO ( Korean Ragnarok Online ) for a long time. The new classes are : " Lord Knight ", " High Wizard ", " High Priest ", " Snipers ", " Whitesmith ", " Assassin Cross ", " Padalin ", " Stalkers ", " Professor ", " Clown ", " Gypsy ", " Champion ", and " Creator ". What I've read on these new classes, is that they will be a complete bitch to become. Let's use Lord Knight as an example for our table. Novice > Swordsman > Knight > Rebirth Novice > Swordsman > Advanced Knight > Lord Knight. This is the part that got me lost, " Rebirth Novice ". In order to become 3-1, you must become 99/50 as a 2nd class. Once you get to 99/50, you apply for becoming a 3-1 job class. They then turn you back into a novice, and you go back to leveling like becoming a 1st class again, then to 2nd. Once your 2nd yet again, you must get to 99/50 and then, finally! You have now becomed 3-1!  It's all confusing, I'm still working on some charts on how to make proper builds before this comes out for kRO, even. I'll list out some nice links on places you can find some nice information and help on 3-1 class.   urlLink Link 1 ( don't know who created it )    urlLink Link 2 ( Master Fu Xui spreads the information to the iRO community BBS )    urlLink Link 3 ( Pictures of the new job classes from the official kRO Site )
