The characters name is Lennie he is a mentally retarded adult. Well the class was laughing at the way he acted and this made me extremely angry. Normally i am a very pacifistic person but this made me border on physical violence. I finnaly calmed down and realized why this is. I am a very sensitive person when it comes to the mentally retarded. From third grade through fifth grade i worked with students at a local school for the handicapped and during this time I learned that people with those kind of disorders are the sweetest, kindest, most loving people in the world and I do not like it when others laugh at these pure people. Now just to make it clear i am not accusing anyone in my class and I apologize if I offend anyone in my class but i am just expressing my feeling at the time.
