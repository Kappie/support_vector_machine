Is it really their fault for not giving me the proper resources such as time, books, learning aids, a half-stable house for eight years, or was it just my lack of creativity? I certainly can't say anything about the opportunities that they've provided. Those, admittedly have been amazing, but what good are opportunities if the resources to take advantage of them? I'm probably just passing the buck.  That is all.         -- Feanor.
