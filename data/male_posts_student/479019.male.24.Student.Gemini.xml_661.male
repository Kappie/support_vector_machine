Orion's aligned now Turn back the time The California Sky  -  Unwritten Law 's "California Sky" from their 1998 self-titled album.  That was the song on my mind when I woke up this morning. I don't know if I've mentioned it here before, but I usually wake up with a song in my head. Yesterday was Del Shannon's "Runaway." Today it's Unwritten Law.  I've been so fucking tired. The cold really drained me. I'm expecting a long day today.  I could use an energy boost of some sort.  *
