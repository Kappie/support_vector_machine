Also, SQL is so powerful that every database task can be done using it. As All major databases support SQL,knowing it can allow you work with different databases.  As a coding novice, I'm learning SQL too. The four basic statements, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, are very easyto master. Now I am able to do basic database tasks such as retrieving database table records or inserting new row into a table.  Just use SQL itself isn't very interesting. But when SQL is combined withserver-side programming technologiessuch as PHP, ASP.NET, it becomes a powerful tool for web applications development. So any programmer should at least know the basics of SQL.  By the way, my polling system is finally complete. Although a large amount of time is spent on testing stored procedures, the development process is stillsmooth. Now I have a complete pollingcomponents, andI can use it on my web site. But unfortunatelyASP.NET 2.0is still in beta stage, Icannotpublish my web site. I hope my web site can be hostedby next year, after the public release ofASP.NET 2.0full version.
