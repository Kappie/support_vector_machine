I get like this everytime, and everytime I promise next time will be better. I promise next time will be better. I never change though. And why should I? I guess the feeling is less now than it used to be, but still. I want to be with her.  She says I never enjoy myself, that I'm always too quiet. But where was the last place we went? Chads? When was that? Right after I got my wisdom teeth out....hmmm...when was that?  dissapointed? read my poems.
