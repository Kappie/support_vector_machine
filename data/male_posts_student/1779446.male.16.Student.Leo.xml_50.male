I went to North Rocks Computer market, bumped into David Siow and Ray. Looking for a cheap graphics card I can run Halo with. Right now I'm using "integrated" technology. I got a paper and some minced beef. I also wrote a song today using ancient monster movies as inspiration. Basically the song revolves around monsters destroying suburbia, a city that unleashed the beast.  Right now I am listening to Sixpence none the Richer's cover of "there she goes" by the La's. It's proabably one of the better covers I have heard. They do a pretty sweet version of "don't dream it's over". Who said Christian bands sucked? They do, but Sixpence rock. I need their album. I've had a shower, now I feel so clean and comfortable.  Onto the topic of my title. Why do I need flowers? I have no idea. Maybe because I am ever-so-slowly going queer, with brownies and sixpence none the richer, but then again, the world is, ever-so-slowly, turning gay. It is a sad fact but the "macho dudes" of yesteryear are a dying breed.   Cheers,  Colin
