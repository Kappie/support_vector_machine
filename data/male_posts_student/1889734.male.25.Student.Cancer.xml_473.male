DeMint asks: 'How can any free nation survive when a majority of its citizens, now dependent on government services, no longer have the incentive to restrain the growth of government?' DeMint's fear, that dependency produces 'learned helplessness,' echoes Tocqueville's warning about government keeping people 'fixed irrevocably in childhood,' rendering 'the employment of free will less useful and more rare.'
