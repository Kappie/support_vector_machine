Well...we start selling lunches at starbucks tomorrow. Wooo. No, its not exciting, it just means more work for me. Oh well. The good news is, I never have to leave the store. LOL. Because, you know, the two minute walk over to Einstein's to buy lunch is sooo rough. Gah.   I have no news. At all. How sad.   P.S. I still need a boyfriend...someone needs to hook me up. :)
