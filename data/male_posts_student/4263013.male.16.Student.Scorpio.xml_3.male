"good morning my baby, let me light up your life.. dont leave me be so i wont cry.." then, the baby lost his heartbeat.. at this moment, his parents cried but his brother still kept on singing.. "good morning my baby, let me light up your life.. dont leave me be so i wont cry.." suddenly, the baby gained back his heartbeat, his purple colored skin slowly turned back to normal.. everyone in the room got shocked and told the young boy that, "sing and continue to sing Micheal.. sing the beautiful song to your brother so that he may be happy.." at this moment, the baby has his skins color back to normal.. then the baby gained conciousness and started to cry..  we may think that a simple song may not make a person bring back his life but the prayer that comes with it is the reason of the miracle.. God is good and he will give you what you want if you just pray..
