I'm still getting used to my relationship with Lisa.  I really don't know what it is now.  I am so confused.  I wish I could just go sleep and wake up and things would be great.  Right now I kinda wish I had never met Lisa so I wouldn't have to deal with all this.  Not because I don't like her but because I do.  I just wish I could understand what is going through her mind right now.  I know she is a flirt, and I know she likes one of the guys who runs track at another school.  And lately I kinda feel like I am being dismissed.  Like right after she told me she thought we should change things she made it seem like she wanted to forget me.  I know I am probably paranoid but what can I say?  I am so tired of feeling like this.  I hate it.  After not talking to her since Tuesday I get to talk to her for about half an hour and I don't get a single thing out of her.  She said she might not come to YG because she hurt her feet.  While I understand that, I don't understand how she can go to school and still go to practice (which she said she was at today) but not come to YG.  Then tonight I get online and I say Hi, she says Hi.  She goes away for 3 minutes.  Comes back I get to say 3 sentences and then she says she has to leave.  So our total conversation was about 5 minutes.  I was looking forward to seeing her today but Steph's meet was cancelled.  So Kevin and I hung out.  I need to ask her sometime tomorrow if she knows where the meet on Thursday is.  I really don't know what kind of answer I'll get.  If I get the feeling that she doesn't want me there then I'll know I just need to forget everything.  I won't mention that I want to bring Kevin.  I really feel like crying right now.  I just hate how I feel.  I want things to be better but IDK when that will happen.  Thankfully I get to work all day tomorrow.  So I hopefully won't have to deal with how I feel till later that night if at all.  Kevin and I were going to go to Steph's meet today but it was rained out.  So instead I brought Kevin to my house and we played ping-pong for a bit.  Then I took him out to dinner.  We ate at Chili's.  The waitress there made us feel like little kids.  She kneeled down when she talked to us.  Aside from that the food was excellent.  But I get even more confused about my life when I talk to Kevin.  Cause he and Lisa talk a lot and she tells him how she feels, much the same way I tell Jill.  So he has these little interjections that make me wonder if he is teasing or if he knows what he is talking about.  But all this being miserable about my relationship or whatever it is with Lisa has left me feeling pretty depressed.  I don't think I realized how much she meant to me.  I mean it feels like I lost a kidney or some other vital organ... say a heart.  I almost feel like asking Lisa to level with me on everything but then again if what I think is right I don't really want to know.  Right now without knowing much of anything this is what I think.  And I could be totally wrong and IDK if I want to be wrong or if I want to be right.  I guess I feel that Lisa still likes me and that she didn't like where it was going.  That she doesn't want me to know that she still likes me because then it would cause me to act differently.  Like I said I don't know what I want right now.  I wish I could just disappear and come back in 5 years... maybe 10.... heck why come back at all.  I wish I knew what to do.  I know I haven't said it because I don't want to start something or cause something to happen that shouldn't but I know I still love her.  I don't know if she knows this but it is true.  Everything I said to her online and on the phone and wherever I meant.  I think she is very unique and I truly love her.  Altho I can say that I'm not the only one.  I really don't know what to do.  I don't want to date her (again) because it would probably end up killing everything this time... but I do want to be around her and be the one she looks to.  Oh well.  All this makes me feel pretty empty.  I almost feel purposeless.  Oh big long words I know but hey.  For the longest time my life was devoted to making Lisa happy.  I know I probably shouldn't have let it become like that but it is true.  Lisa was and IDK I guess still is the highlight of my day.  It is hard and not a whole lot of fun right now.  No one really knows how I feel.  I've been able to hide this from everyone.  I haven't even told Jill.  As far as everyone knows I'm happily single.  And don't let me get myself wrong... I know I need to be single right now, I know I need to be concentrating on things other than girls... (namely one) but I can't do it right now.  It is seriously no fun.  The only good thing about being so depressed or angry or IDK what I am is that I am getting to be a giant.  425 pushups since Friday.  At this rate I should have done about 1000 by YG this Friday.  Fun isn't it.  I'm also running more and I'm getting in better shape all around.  Pretty soon I'm going to be unstoppable.  The only bad thing about being in good shape and being muscular is that unfortunately most of the time the other sex is attracted to it.  Allissa who came to YG a total of 3 times maybe and who've I've talked to online very little lately talked to me yesterday.  She told me she had a crush on me and it was pretty evident that she still does.  I just don't want to deal with relationships anymore.  I wish I could just stop thinking about Lisa and I.  I want to be the old me.  The one who didn't care about who liked him.  Was that ever me?  IDK.  I don't know what I want.  I want to be happy I guess.  But that might mean giving things up that I care a lot for.  Life... grand isn't it?  Well I'm off to do a couple hundred pushups or so.  I think I am going to aim for 1200 pushups by Friday.  Which means that I need to get cracking.  Only 4 days left.  With 775 pushups to go I need to do about 200 a night.  Maybe I'll pop my shoulders out of their joints and be able to not think... wouldn't that be nice.
