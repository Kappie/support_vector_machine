He gave me, as you can probably tell, a great deal to write about.  He lived in the countryside on a hill that had a small but fairly busy country road alongside it. Anyway, I was at his house but it wasn’t his house: there were a number of different people, and even another family living under the one roof.  This wasn’t even a very big house.  I thought that he had a large amount of lodgers but hey, that’s his life.   The longer I stayed there though, the more I thought that it was more of a collective than having some lodgers due to the freedom that they all had in the house i.e. no rooms designated to different people just a house with lots of people there.  But I still just accepted it.  He owned a field: that was cool  At one point he left me in the hall whilst he talked to his mum, along one side he had it covered in photos, so I looked at a few: the normal family shots.  But then my eye fell on one that has scarred me to this day.   It is a beautiful sunset, he is sitting at the bottom of the field on a gate and his brother is sat next to him with back to camera facing the sunset.  Normal ? Not when you are naked.  Not when you and your brother are absolutely bollock naked sitting on a fence in a field that has a road alongside it. Not on a hill.  HOW? WHY? WAS IT A BET? IS IT SOMETHING MORE SINISTER? IS HE DEMENTED? COULD THAT JUST HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT?    HES 15, TEENAGERS DON’T DO THAT, 4 YEAR OLDS DON’T DO THAT.  PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE CAMERAS ABOUT.  I was scared. Panicky even. Was I, at any moment, going to be invited to join them and their perverted fun? Was I going to be cut up into tiny pieces and used to grit the roads?  What do you do?  What do you do when he then invites you to a Christmas disco at a youth club, knowing that due to his lack of social skills if you decline he wont accept it but keep trying to persuade you and work out a way for you to be able to be there.  i agreed. i thought that at least it would be a youth club with lots of people who might be fun and may be equally scared of him.  but this was of course assuming it was a YOUTH CLUB, a club for any youths that councils set up to stop us burning things.  but no, it was a an organisation youth club i.e. like cubs, scouts, young badgers of westminster etc.  more specifically it was a club full of people like him  my biggest problem with it was that upon arriving and being met with teenagers, happy to see me, shaking my hand and hugging me, they all formed a circle put their hand in the air and started chanting something along the lines of being related to trees and being full of love.  then leaflets were shoved into my hand about the "club" which bore the logo that "dominic" had refused to speak about.  it was called "the woodcraft folk" or woodies for short. no one else seemed to understand what that is a double entendre for.  suddenly it struck me: the happiness, the joy, the nakedness, IT WAS A CULT.  was i going to be cut up into tiny pieces and used to grit the roads? was tonight the night of the ceremonial killing  the disco kicked off, i sat at the back scared.  do you know the music from blade at the underground club at the beginning? and when it gets to the climax the blood pores from the sprinkler system and they are all vampires. shock horror.  that exact song was played after about an hour, and looking up i could clearly see a prinkler system  i headed for the door.  it turns out it is just a youth club of deeply evil people  if by any chance you are in the woodcraft folk or founded it or something, no offence, but you really dont represent the nations youths and are a bit scary, particularly when someone arrives expecting a youth club and finds a collection of bizarre characters who  - from the chant you did - are closely related to trees.  we didnt keep in good contact after that  but there is an even worse side to "dominic" - whenever anyone, months after i last contacted him would say "i wonder what dominic is doing" that very day i would see him. and just seeing him really scares me.  yesterday i was in a restaurant and i thought i saw him coming into a restaurant: i almost choked, broke into a cold sweat and started shaking  even worse i keep hearing things about him, he apparently spent 9 months in spain, has been riding a unicycle round town, went to circus camp to learn to eat fire and maybe will be going to sixth form and doing his exams at my school in the near future.  i dont know what i will do to get over my phobia if this is true.  although i hear good things about cianide
