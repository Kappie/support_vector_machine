I plan to see both since they both look pretty good, but i never thought id see this....critics hated  urlLink Half-Baked  (which was pretty funny), disliked  urlLink Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back . They did love  urlLink Dazed and Confused , but i dont know how much you can consider that stoner  humor .   JBUS
