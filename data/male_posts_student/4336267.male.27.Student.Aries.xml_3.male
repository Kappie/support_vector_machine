What's the problem with sending voice packets? This is easier said than done. Lets explore some of the problems with communicating voice packets over wireless data networks.  Data transmission relies heavily on error free reception.The exising wireless standards such as the 802.11 series are optimized for sending data. Thus if packets are lost over the wireless link, they will be repeatedly retransmitted by the sender, till they are successfully sent, or the retransmission limit is received. The delay caused due to these retransmissions is hardly of concern for data transmissions. On the contrary, voice communication emphasizes more on being delay free than error-free. Speech codecs do have some level of proprietary error concealment, which can make up for packet losses. However, delays in receiving packets are undesirable, as those who've been subject to such delays in long distance phone conversations would agree. The ITU specifies a limit of 150ms for end-to-end delay for voice communications. However, equipment manufacturers often stretch the limit to 200-250ms.  The delay in the wireless link is just a part of the problem. If we have a phone which sends voice packets through the access point, and thereafter through the internet back-bone to another phone, the delay and jitter issues associated with VoIP systems are added on. The good news?. For one, the IEEE recently ratified a new MAC standard named the 802.11e. One of the significant features of this standard, is that it prioritizes packets. Thus voice packets have a higher priority, as compared to data packets. This is just a part solution, since more needs to be done to limit the large number of retransmissions due to packet losses in the channel. certain companies such as Spectralink and Cisco have already come out with Wireless VoIP phones. The Spectralink phones have been charged with tweaking the 802.11 MAC by reducing the contention time (which is the time each wifi user waits before he can transmit). And while equipment makers and standards bodies keep arguing about the nature of such a thing, the phones seem to serve the purpose.  Some of the proposed methods focus on adapting voice over wlan focus on avoiding packet losses due to bit errors in the channel and collisions. These include 1) Using link adaptation (i.e feedback from the receiver to determine the quality of the wireless channel and adapt transmission accordingly) 2) Transmitting multiple copies of the same packet so that even if one copy is lost, it doesnt have to be retransmitted. This introduces additional overheads but reduces delay due to retransmissions.  There are a whole lot of issues associated with different aspects of voice over wireless LANs. Skeptics may wonder about the long term prospects of VowLAN, given that VoIP systems are being deployed only now. Voice over wireless networks still holds a lot of promise as a cheaper alternative to cellular communications in the long run.
