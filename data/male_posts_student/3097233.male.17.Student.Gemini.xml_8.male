Just a note to self, do not rely on your girlfriend to be a friend and expect her friends to accept that YOU ARE DATING their friend and that they should be understanding of that atleast. Anyhow, I'm done with [**insert female dog here**]ing about that so enough of that. I am finishing up a writing and to the readers of my blog here is the website it will be off of:  urlLink  My homepage (www.geocities.com/blhcorp/ )   It will be in the Writings section of that, and I believe that I will make a post of the writings here too, but you never know with me.
