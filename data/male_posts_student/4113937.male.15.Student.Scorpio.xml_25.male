The Sotong and Crabmeat with bacon was really very nice.  The Grass Jelly become the Glass Jelly, haha..        After that, went to the MRT station to top up ez-link for my uncle but the quenue was still very long, no choice but to quenue up, but come to the my q was like the faster, less than 5min i reach the machine while the q next to me was like still waiting at the middle.  After that took bus 51 back home, on the bus look at the picture that we just take at the place.. reach home around 11.35pm like that, everyone was asleep when i reached home, and no one scolded me.  hehe..      Yesterday afternoon, asked her one more time whether she still want to the firework a not, but the answer was negative, she decided to go to her friend place for BBQ.  So what can i do,  actually wanted to go see the bag that she mentioned that one of her male friend going to buy for her.  but the flash and splash was closed when i go to the Citylink.  Damn sianz, hope the guy don't so fast get for her. haha..       Today, woke up at 8am.. my throat was still very painful, just don't know why forever, when i get sore throat, my flu and cough will all come together.. haha.. later going to ikea to see things.. hope can get what i wanted! haha.. Shall end here.. see ya tonight when i update again!
