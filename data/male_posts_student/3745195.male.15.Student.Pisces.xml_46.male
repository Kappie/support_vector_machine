Life is just kinda normal right now [normal? who can really determine what normal is] well anyway nothing really dramatic happened today. Woke up went on a run and then called anisia [high point of the day except for the fact that i woke her up {sorry}] then mowed my neighbor's lawn, ate lunch watch "Chariots of Fire" [running movie {surprisingly good}] and now I'm here posting [also talking to nicole and anisia {Yay}] Oh and listening to usher [both remixes of burn are awesome]  Catch you cats on the flip flop later
