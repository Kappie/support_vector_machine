But please excuse me if I feel like informing you on weird or out-of-the-ordinary things I do on a daily basis. And from now on, you can kiss my ass if you don't like my post. That said, I now move on to my next subject. --- As I now have a job, it is difficult to have a social life on weekends. For instance, this Saturday Jesse is having a Blue Man party, but I have work until 9:00pm. This also intervenes on my band practice. Point being, my weekends are fucked, and that pisses me off. --- This school year is now coming to a close, leaving me to ponder some things. One thought I had today is "Why are there so many non-band members joining the flag corps?". Scary, isn't it? It really gives me a reason o call them flaggots (flag + faggots = flaggots[this name suits them so very, very well]).   I was forced to return my Tuba to Mac today... Rolling a tuba in a tuba case across Macarthur is not an easy task, I might add. It makes you hot n' sweaty!!! --- Boston in two weeks...   *note    whenever I place a '---' that means I have just changed subjects. Just thought I would let the readers know.
