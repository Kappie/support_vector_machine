What it comes down to is a matter of choice, wether you have it or not, wether the options are good or bad...  - Do I stay purely Filipino or adapt and mix it up?  Somewtimes we don't have those options and we're forced into a path we can't escape...  - Convert or die?  - Steal or starve?  When we're allowed a choice then we become empowered because we become directly involved in the decision making process. We no longer feel trapped because we have a choice, because we have control.  And it is this aspect of control in our lives that improves our opportunity and perceptions of our sense of 'quality of life.'   7/11/04 "Back to Angeles City..."  (Just some quick thoughts on the trip back.)  So I just remembered this, but why the heck is it important for Filipinos to learn English so that U.S. companies will feel comfortable coming to the Philippines? I'm sure I'm reading too much into this (the conspiracy theory nut that I am) when the assistant U.S. Amabassador gave a speech about how the U.S. hopes Filipinos keep learning how to speak English so U.S. companies will interested in working with the Filipinos (LOL, what type of corporate imperial dogma is that?). Anyways, found it ironic since I'm trying to learn about Filipino cultural identity and heritage and none of the speakers talked about that and mentioned that Filipinos should learn English.  Some quick addendums: * There is actually a location in BRGY. Maruglo for cell phone service. It's located near the front entrance, just before you get to the water buffalo.  * Bummed that Secretary Dinky is no longer the Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare (she had to resign in order for the Vice-President of the Philippines to take that position ~ something about the position being traditionally held by the V-P). So much for having someone qualified for the position and instead being replaced by political nepotism.  The ride back was uneventful...  1) Stopped by a 4x4 competition which seemed odd since I usually view that as a very 'red neck' thing and very American...  2) Stopped by Nepo Mall. Again, Filipinos love their malls, gives them a chance to socialize and this (like the ones in Makati) was packed.  3) I get asked two questions over and over... Am I single and am I married? LOL! ;)  7/12/04 "The situation in Sitio Calapi..." (Very depressing situation here, tons of environmental issues, where's Ruby when I need her, this is her field of expertise...) ;)  Very depressed village with numerous public health dilemnas. Most problems are enviromenentally related due to internal and external factors:  1) Located near Clark Airbase (BRGY. Marcos Village), a source of a lot of air pollution from jets as well as the former U.S. military presence,  2) Waste management of both human feces/urine as well as standard garbage (tin, plastic, etc...) and not having a centralized location and as a result, the waste being spread all over the place,  3) Questionable water sources such that the deep water well's water integrity has been compromised by a possibly contaminated stream and that the current water source is a sediment filled stream higher up the mountain,  3) Increasing respiratory problems in the form of asthma from 3 known sources; a) air pollution from Clark Airbase, b) air pollution from burning refuse in the village, and c) prevalent smoking of adults among youth and infants.  Education is also a matter that's needs to be addressed as the educational committment at Sitio Calapi has been dwindling over time with the parents of the children complaining that their children aren't learning anything (the teachers are there intermittently and then only for a few hours). Currently the school supports up to grade 4 education.
