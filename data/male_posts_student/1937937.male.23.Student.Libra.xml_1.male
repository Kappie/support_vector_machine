His long dark hair is cut short above his forehead; his dark eyebrows give way to a face shadowed by an oversized nose.  He is shivering this cold, dark morning, walking slowly to the chambers of  urlLink Queen Christina of Sweden , where he will tutor her in mathematics.  It is the winter of 1650, and  urlLink René Descartes  is not accustomed to the morning hours.  He is a gentleman.  It is his custom to rest in bed through the morning; a habit leftover from his childhood, when he was small and sickly.  He is not a man familiar with hard work, yet he has produced some of the greatest ideas of his era.  Here is the man who said  je pense, donc je suis : I think, thus I am.  He seeks irreducibility of ideas: this tenet is the backbone on which he will build a highly critical philosophical system designed to tackle problems in the exact sciences.  As he walks towards the young queen’s chambers, Descartes begins to sniffle.  He does not know it, but he has caught a cold which will shortly reduce him to delirium.  He will die of pneumonia in 10 days, on February 11 th , 1650.  Descartes provides us with a foundation with which we can examine the nature of the abstract.  He has the idea, some say while watching a fly crawl in the corner of his bedchamber, to measure points as distances from set lines, or axes.  Each point he determines to be the intersection of lines parallel to his axes.  He paves the way for the modern  urlLink coordinate system , which allows us to say the following:  Given AB  ^  BC, let x m  = a point on AB and y n  = a point on BC, then the intersection of the  ^  lines formed by drawing DE || BC out from x m  and FG || AB out from y n  forms a point, (x m , y n ) in the coordinate plane.  Descartes is able to see that equations such as  f(x) = x 2   can be visualized by moving the line DE in conjunction with the line FG in a certain ratio.  This idea obviously gives way very quickly to the idea of derivatives and only a generation later  urlLink Newton  and  urlLink Gottfried Leibniz  independently come to discover  urlLink The Calculus .   urlLink E-mail me .
