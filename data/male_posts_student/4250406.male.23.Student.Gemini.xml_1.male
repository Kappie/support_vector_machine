Speaking from a geek point of view, I do enjoy the fact that this whole place seems to be XHTML compliant, right down to the  bold  tags using CSS. But I digress. I really only started this blog to read my buddy  urlLink Paul 's blog and comment on it. I don't remember if I was required to register, but I did anyway and here I am.  Where to begin? Well, let's start with what you already know. I'm a dude, I have a girl of nearly 6 years now. She's usually my better half and seems to tolerate me just enough, which is good. What else... ah yes, well I'm the youngest of 5 children (1 sister, 3 brothers) and I don't have much to say about that. I also have a cat (Bart) and a pair o' lovebirds (Rocky & Adrian). I go to school (still... yes... don't ask, please) at the University at Buffalo (yes, I said AT) and I seem to be majoring in Electrical Engineering.  So anyway, most of the time I'll say (physically) what I think, which makes a blog not so interesting to read. I guess I can do some ranting on here from time to time and see how it goes. My guess is, only a few people will actually read this crap.  Here is my blog for what I'm currently doing:  Well, I'm sitting here, typing. Cat is at her final exam for Art History 390. I'll go pick her up and if we're hungry, we'll head out to Edison Diner to celebrate, then maybe watch 21 Grams afterwards. My days this summer have been as follows: Wake up, work, bullshit, eat, tv/movie, sleep, repeat. I've made some money this summer, but it will be all gone again soon because it's me we're talking about. Going back to school via Budget truck a week from today. Hopefully the apartmentmates will be cool.  Ok, I'm bored now. Time to go watch the Olympics and work on  urlLink www.moorecat.com .
