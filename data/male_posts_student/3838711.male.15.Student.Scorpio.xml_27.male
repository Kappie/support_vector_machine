First off, today wasnt really the day i was expecting, since i'm feeling down lately, and the second lesson for the day, CME lesson, talked on reasons for dating and BGR relationships... after that, straight came Pastoral Care lesson, guess what ? Family ties... All these affairs of the heart really had me slanting towards the deep dark side of me again.. in class somemore.. then after that i kinda lost a bit of interest to do wadever there is.. maths.. as well as chinese homework.  Brought my home clothes today, (just a green shirt, lol) and went to Century Square Fun Factory to play Wangan Midnight. Just barely 4 games, me and Sherman were kicked out, due to the fact that we didnt change our trousers.. Actually had a hunch when i first looked into the arcade, there werent any school students, or related clothes.. As expected, the rule to us first timers was unknown.. thus, 30 minutes and we had to leave the premises. Whats so bad is that Sherman didnt even get to experiment with the game, and we were out of the place. Sorry Sherman.. i've been hogging the machine to last my extra $2 start to the max... but didnt know u cant play as a result... sigh.. sheesh.  Then at night, Sherman intro-ed me a girl (again -.-"), called Sharon, chinese name Shu Yun, (surname still unknown =X) studys at Serangoon Sec Sch... At first i tot the sch was in Serangoon, but OMG, its in Hougang... lol.. further than CHIJ Sengkang.. Goodness...  She dun wanna gimme her hp number.. then had to ask Sherman for the number. He say he not sure have or not sia... power.  Tomorrow meeting "her", Karie, again.. bought her a gift at Yellow at Century Square.. A necklace carrying her horoscope, hope she likes it... hee. Compass Point will be the place..  Still feeling kind of down, but somewhat felt better, when i commit myself to the fact that one cant be forced to love.. haha, still and STILL having my darn sore throat and fever, but it got much much better now... taking panadol later, and its off to bed.. for a whole new day tml.. dunno whether can slp first anot, cos i napped for quite a while at 6-8 pm... hehe..  Ok, thats about it... wow, kinda lenghty, dunno the page can support anot... haha, nitez pple... and even tho i'm not Christian or whatever, but, God Bless. :)
