This was in a museum, and me and miscelleaneous other people had a set amount of time to find Jonathan and show him this, or else this little psychic kid who was plugged into the wall would blow us all up.  But then I talked to the kid and he was an okay guy, so we took him with us to see Iris Acker, but the road to the video had turned into a jungle.  So we fought off jungle monsters using our various superpowers and got to the video, which was different the second time.
