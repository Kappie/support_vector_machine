Maybe I should call it Peaceful Afternoon. Anyways, I did my paperwork till 3:30am. I am hell bent into making it to UP Diliman. I am making sure that my assignments and exams will be perfect to get the grades I need to get to UP.  I don't really have much to do today. I have a short list of my  must be done before the day ends.     1.) Must find a rare DVD for Peloy. 2.) Must find Lucky a nice gift too. 3.) Must find myself new jeans. 4.) Must find a gift for Dell. 5.) Must read The Idiots Guide to Labradors.  I have yet to finish my filipino assignments. I'm not even halfway done yet. The assignment is pretty long but its not intellectually straining except for some deep Tagalog words that I can't understand. Anyways, BB took a bath earlier! Yey! I can breathe a little easier. That's one responsibility that has been done for today.  *Stares blankly at the screen again*  Upon closer inspection, I have officially been a blog addict! Blogging is habit forming. Yet its fun and it improves your vocabulary. Hehehehe! I have yet to learn how to post pics to I can add images to my blog.
