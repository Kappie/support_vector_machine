Firstly the pieces, Stumbled a little during the first piece, damn bow just kept bouncing off the bloody strings, and while trying to achieve a piano effect, think I slowed the tempo down. Second piece? As i said before, the way I play the piece definitely makes Dvorak turn in his bloody grave. Pure musical tormentation I tell you, Didnt know how the examiner took it in his stride...the octaves went a weee out of tune...and of all the things to happen, my damn slightly quivering fingers slipped a little on the fingerboard, thus costing me in my already very pathetic intonation. And as for the third piece, well, think I didnt really make the usual errors I usually make when I play it, though during the  Allegretto  part my intonation went awry AS usual....bleargh.  Scales was at total nightmare...the majors were fine, harmonic minors were also fine...BUT the melodic minors were a total bloody mess...and he gave me B flat melodic minor, which is like the hardest scale to play in grade 6...awww frig it. Dominant sevenths were ok too, though accidentaly added in one extra note..and the WORST was the Diminished Sevenths...despite him being the kind guy and giving me a second try to attempt the diminished sevenths, I erm, politely refused.  If scales was a nightmare, then the aural part was pure hell. I swear that I sung like a dying chicken...and what made matters worst was that I think that my voice cracked a little while singing halfway...oh well, there goes my aural marks...fail it everytime anyway.  Yeap that about sums up my violin exam...think i can jolly well kiss it goodbye and having a grade 6 ranking to my name..oh well. After the exam, had to rush home, rest a while before I had to go out again for dental. Managed to complete one webpage during the bus journey to orchard. Changed the braces colours to green and black!  Reached home, had dinner, played Ground Control II for a while before I started with IMMF. That was like at what, 9pm? And yeap, just finished everything at 2.30a.m. Hell, guess I only have myself to blame for leaving it to the last minute...  Well guess thats it then, now listening to the very emotionally charged soundtrack of the Samurai X OVA..I swear that I have never seen a better anime then this one...hell, all the females who watched cried! Moved me as well too....but yea thats enough, suddenly been hit with a bloody head-splitting headache, and the fact that I am gonna be very busy tomorrow is not comforting at all...  Later people.
