(for having an oscar-winning song, i thot eminem was really screwed.) quite an underwhelming show compared to last year imo. instead of scintillating performances from p. diddy, justin timberlake, bruce springsteen, eminem etc, we had rather subpar songs from coldplay, 50 cent (yes it sucked imo), i don't know who else cuz it was so forgettable. and whereas jimmy fallon had a great energy and enthusiasm (read: opening song montage and impersonations of lance bass etc), chris rock was mean-spirited and didn't show much originality. funny jokes though...  "my favorite show is making the band 2, cuz p. diddy is mentoring these kids. who better than puff daddy to show them wrong from wronger? ... paula abdul judging a singing contest is like Christopher reeves judging a dance contest ... 50 cent took more shots to the face than jenna jameson!... our next presenter is being sued by more people than the catholic church -- p. diddy!"  jimmy fallon with the fab 5: "ever heard of the show 'black eye from a straight guy'?"  ben stiller: "the viewer's choice award is...cruz bustamante!" *crickets*  jack black: "if someone told me a year ago i would be getting the super genius of the universe award, i wouldn't have believed it. david blaine, your magic is real and i believe in you!"  adam sandler: "i saw beyonce in the backstizzle, her tizzle put a gizzle in my pizzle!" snoop dogg: "i thought you was married." sandler: "ah shizzle!"  crank yankers doing viewers' choice: "first vote for kelly clarkson! haha, what, is this her mom? no i'm kidding...oh, um, hi mrs. clarkson. how are you?" ... "i like bitches and hoes!! yaaay!!"  eminem in easily the funniest skit of the night: "you remember last year when i beat the shit out of some puppet that was saying shit about me. so i went into anger management, and i'm a changed man. i learned violence against puppets and people is wrong." "it's my birthday, yaaay!!" *beats the shit out of the puppet* "i've learned to treat puppets with respect..."  ben stiller: "maybe we can cop an award at the oscars. we have to win something." drew Barrymore: "you might win for most Caucasian attempt to plug a movie." stiller: "damn bitch, that shit's old!"  good charlotte breaking their guitars and equipment ... man, rage against the machine called, they want their retarded stage destruction gimmick back. "good charlotte? more like a mediocre green day." hahaha...  then daily show... "California is in a terrible state. we need someone with a fresh view, someone new and inexperienced. what if you had a plumbing problem -- the problem is with the pipes. what you need is someone original and unique to fix it, someone who's never done plumbing before. we could try a new approach--say, without pipes."  jay leno: "i ordered a big mac and fries, and for 39 cents more they told me i could run for governor ... we have 194 candidates, 194 and a half if you count gary coleman ... mike Tyson filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, which incidentally is the highest chapter he's ever reached... demi moore and ashton kutcher are thinking of marriage, which is good cuz it's a lot easier to do than adoption. they want to book their honeymoon flight quickly, while they still have the 'kids fly free' program."  ben Affleck reading gigli reviews: "it was so terrible i had to clean my palate with glitter." ouchies.
