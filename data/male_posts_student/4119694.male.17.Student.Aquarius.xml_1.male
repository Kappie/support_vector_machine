Then today, I had to go and check in for band and such at school... yuck... I have to go to school next week for band camp... yeah, laugh if you want, but apparently the band camp members are good at sex ;-) (yes, I finally saw American Pie and American Pie 2).  Well, school is starting on a Wed. this year... that blows.  But oh well... I still get to be a senior and get out 5 or 6 days early.  I'm getting way excited for school to start though.  I get to see all my friends again, I get to see Mandy every day (God, that will be wonderful), and it'll be my last year.  Plus, there's drumline season (and the football games, I guess...), band (which I don't care what people say, it's still fun), the choir trip to Flordia, etc. al.  Now if Mandy's ex would just stop being annoying... life would be wonderful :-)  Well that's about it... I'll leave you all with this.   I saw a sunflower growing on the freeway today.   Yes... a real, honest to goodness sunflower... growing right up out of the cracks of an overpass on Hwy 218.  I did a double take when I saw it... or at least, as much of a double take as I could while passing it at 70 mph.  It had grown a couple of feet out of the ground and was as big and bright and perfect as any sunflower could ever hope to be.  As I watched the brave little flower that was determined to hold it's own in the cruel world of concrete, metal, and exhaust that some wayward bird had no doubt left it in, I thought about the children's book "Hind's Feet on High Places."  There was a little red poppy in the story that grew from a crack of a mountainside.  As a seedling it had been left there by it's enemies to die... but because it chose to forgive them and love them, it found the strength and the will to survive and flourish in that barren and desolate home.   Sometimes I feel like that sunflower and that poppy.  I've been dropped into a harsh and cold world.  The environment I live in isn't the environment I was created for.  It's so hard for me to remember that the only way I can survive in this world is to let the love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ give me the strength and the will to survie and flourish in the alien world we call Earth.   I'm so thankful I passed that little sunflower today.  It's picture is etched in my mind as a constant reminder that I was not made for this world... but by God's grace I have been equipped to live in it.
