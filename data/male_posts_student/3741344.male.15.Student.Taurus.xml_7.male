Only thing i'm pissed off about is this 'safe and sane' california shit. I don't want pretty fireworks... I want to blow shit up. Sure, i'll buy sparklers.. but only to use them to light off m150s. What's cooler then blowing a hole in the side of somone's trashcan? Nothing. All fireworks should be legal. A fountain in an idiot's hand is just as bad as an m80 in anyone's hand. I think it's bullshit.. I want to blow shit up.
