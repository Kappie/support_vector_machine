I started this post out serious, but then i realized it was a little too serious for tens of millions of people to be reading (refer to maximum emo title), so i am now CHANGING THE DIRECTION.  So im working tonight, and i guess a group of 40+ people are coming in tonight to get ice cream... great. Maybe ill fake a heart attack and skidatle outta there. Or accidently dress in an unremovable tuxedo so i cant scoop over 2 scoops an hour. that would be good.  well i just got done with a long debate with jon, which was settled in good graces, everybody is a winner. the point being i now have lost a lot of motivation to type much longer! so imma cut this blog a lil short.  Ben Vevoda - the master of humor. Ben is a dreamer. the coolest freshman in South Carolina, i mean California. a master of the cheffism. If i were to refer to ben as a type of tree, i would say the willow sapling. when you look at a willow sapling you will immediatley know that Ben Vevoda is hiding in a bush nearby.  current box flashing on my toolbar - JTVevox AIM box current breath type - sigh
