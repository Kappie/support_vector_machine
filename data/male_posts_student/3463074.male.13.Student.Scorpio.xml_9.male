It started talking a deep and melodeous voice, telling me to leave this nursery which he was gaurding or he would be forced to inflict forbidden ninja arts upon me. I of scourse was having fun wreaking havoc to the FRENCH children's nursery and thus told him to bug off. I should have considered the fact that my robot body was at the cleaners being refurbished and that my poodle like true form is actually quite weak. I was of course, forgetting temporarialy that i was a master of the Voodoo arts. As he attaked, I barely got to the side in time and plucked a piece of his deliciously moist exterior. I then created it to a likeness of him and ate it, thus eating all of him at once. I should of considered his size before doing this, but i was savoring the wonderful flavor, blueberry! Well, anyway, since i had just swallowed a muffin the size of a few 6 foot tall men, i became very fat, and thus tayed in the bushes hidding nearby for a few hours until it got out and then rolled home to my liposuction. I had decided to purchase it after this had happened the fifth time, and i had gotten tired of getting rid of my fat by removing it with a laser.  Well, i am hopeful that none of you think of me a monstetr for eating the poor muffin, but we all make mistakes, i just make the same ones frequently, because our world is filled with these large muffins.
