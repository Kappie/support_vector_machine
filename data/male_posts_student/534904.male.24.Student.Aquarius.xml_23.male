But then, I've been  pretty sure  before, and been dead wrong... so how the fuck do you tell? Should I go up to her and ask her if she wants to go grab a coffee? If so,  then  what? We seemed to hit it off pretty well in Darwin, but since then we've had fuck-all time together alone, and I really don't perform well under observation. But she went a bit cold on me at the end of the week up there, so I don't know what the fuck is going on... I wish there was some sort of magic  thingo  that I could use to tell her I really like her... but alas, it's not to be =(
