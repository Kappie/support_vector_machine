Not only in my opinion are most writers more lazy but the ones that are dedicated see themselves too much as artists and get a little too weird. I mean why write a good meaningful novel when Gresham can pump out something long, and articulate in a fifth of the time and sell a hundred times as many copies, at least. You can't make people want to read emotionally draining books but you could hope for their sake that they still have a soul, an inkling of human emotion that might compel them to read a real novel. Now the point here is that if the airplane riding public doesn't care about literature and you do, then unfortunately the responsibility to promote it lies on you. The idea is not new, independent literature has been around for a long time, there are even a few organizations for it, but they are surely few and small. Now since most people who read these things are in some way writers it might be good to do something about it. If the inspiration strikes you please get involved or at least for godsake just read Catcher in the Rye or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or something of value.
