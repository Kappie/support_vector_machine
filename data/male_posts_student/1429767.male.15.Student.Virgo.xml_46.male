My heart breaks  My soul aches  As I collapse with a sigh  Such exquisite pain  That burns in my chest  The last star has fallen  I have spoken my last  Take me now sweet shadows  Leave me to my sorrows  And I, the last star of twilight,  Shall die. ***************************** This breaks me within myself.  This shatters my heart.  Full of cries.  Full of lifelessness.  To a shore of night.  To a scar in sight.  The tears are violent in cries.  The misery is poison.  To fill my veins.  To seel my eye.  With a shining tear.  With a single drop.  That fill my soul with sorror to die.  That pain of cries never dies.  That sign shows a light I can never reach.  I'm falling from the sky  I'm falling to the sea of fire.  That has my last word.  That will burn me with fire.
