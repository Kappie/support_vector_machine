I didn’t really mind the assignment, as some people did *glares*, I just hate these minimum and maximums. A minimum of a 1000 is acceptable if you’re talking about writing four-five paragraphs, but 300? You kid me. So I ended up writing only an intro, two body paragraphs, and an end. Like, wtf mate?         Well, you may have noticed all the pics littering the first page; I was just overcome with glee with Hello working speedily xD All are taken by me, I think. The monkey is, most definitely. The only ones that aren’t involve the prom pictures ^_^ Damn you have to hate that smile.           I really need to get seriously started on writing. I mean, let’s face it, if I did, I’d be even more known than I am now. And I have fingers… Nice fingers… Hairy, but none the less, FINGERS.         Me and Fudge were wondering which superhero girl we’d do, since I saw Annisa’s one about male super heroes. Unlike her, we just went for looks (Shallow for a puddle). I think I ended up thinking either Elektra or Jane Grey.         Well, its night time, and I’m getting tired.         I could start writing up my thoughts on current issues, but my thoughts are so deep and complex people seem to have trouble keeping up with the groove… Maybe I’ll start a evaluation type thing, where I find something to read over/listen to and review, and save you trouble from buying crap stuff like CD’s, books, etc. *cough* Of course, my tastes are superior to a fault.     Any suggestions? As long as its reasonable, I’ll try and review it. Even concepts, ideas, the like, whatever.         I’ll be like “ Ask Jeeves ”, except I’d be “ Ask Dammo ”, and you’d get witty retorts and swearing instead of information. Ok, see? It would also be full of lies xD       ENOUGH RAMBLING
