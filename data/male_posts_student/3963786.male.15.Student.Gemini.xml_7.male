I don't know if it's the whole thing that's going on or if I've just suddenly been overcome with laziness. ;) I just looked at how much I wrote last time and all I have to say is "whoa." Guess I just got carried away. lol. I don't think There's gonna be a lot more of those kinds of entries. But besides that, I haven't really done anything exciting, just been wondering about Nikki. How mad she is and when, if ever, she's going to forgive me. I was uncertain about how I felt about her before, but now I know. If I can be this upset and this worried then there has to be something. I haven't written any poems in a while, I think it's been at least2 weeks. I really should get on that tonight.
