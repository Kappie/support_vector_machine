I'm outta options everything I see some one I think of you , I see a girl running I think of you ,I see an ambulance I think of you ,  I see a billboard with a girl I think of you..I watch a movie, there's always something in the movie that reminds me of you, I cant sleep without thinking if yer sleeping in peace , wake up and think .... I wish she's thinking of me ..I'm sorry C I cant shut you out,everything I see or do  reminds me of you.   As much as I know that things between us wont workout cant seem to forget you.sorry if I send you a lot of texts and mails. I miss you. I know you don't have any feelings for me . I'm just a friend. I'm trying to be there C as a friend.. I just miss being there and holding your hand feeling secure .. but then again this is how I feel when I'm with you..I know that I don't make you feel the same .. So it cant be anything more than a friend ( some where deep down inside I think I've lost even that right)  I guess I always thought I made a difference in your life..Like u had made in mine...guess not ..I still care C  ..Its just that everytime I do, I lose you.. I lost you once soon after I reached here , we never mailed each other much, then again in December.. and now. Why cant I just let go of you and forget all these weird feelings I have for you ? I want to.i cant sit still without thinking of you.  wish I could have this big magic wand I could wave and make you the happiest person on the whole world , and make me like you as a friend.   I don't expect any reply for you, cos I've been a jerk and I've said stuff like how I feel.    ------------------------------------------------------------ dear C,           i cant let go .. i have been trying to let go .. everytime i do i seem to miss you more. i know u dont have the same feelings for me ... i wish that you did .. but i guess i understand .. i am not good enough .  maybe some day when u think if things arent going your way .. or you feel that lfes  i guess if i dont see you today i'll understand C, i am not important.  maybe some day if you find that special bond that we had ( dunno if its caled love) you know where to find me .. i am sure i wont hear from you for a while. sorry C. im sorry i fell in love with you  yer friend  viv
