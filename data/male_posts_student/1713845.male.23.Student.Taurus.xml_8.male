Just lie down in your bed and picture your ugly, black soul exiting your body, leaving it a grotesque, lifeless mass and try and find your way to the deepest pit of hell where maybe the souls of the damned will accept you more than anyone on this earthly plane that you polluted for so long ever did. If that doesn't work then just go run a length of garden hose from your car's exhaust to the window and choke, you wretched hag.
