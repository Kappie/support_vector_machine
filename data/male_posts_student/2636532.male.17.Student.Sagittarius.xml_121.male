It's the smell of being alive, knowing that for the next 80 minutes you're up against people that can be faster, stronger and smarter then you, you run in with the knowledge that no matter how good they are one hard hit will put them down. The rush of adrenaline when you go on to the field knowing that you're going to get hit and hit harder or go down trying. and it's amazing that after that 80 minutes are up, after you're bloodied and bruised, you want more, to go back and do it all again just for that rush. -Matt
