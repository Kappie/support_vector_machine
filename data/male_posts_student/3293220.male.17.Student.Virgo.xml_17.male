The school servers, of course, died catastrophically.  Firewalls anybody?  With GTM gone and CJL off sick, it looked like we would be in for another 2 weeks of the network switched off.  How wrong we were.  Welcome Mr. Taylor.  Yesterday was his 8th day on the job, and he seems to be coping with the environment well.  He's certainly been thrown into the deep end and doing rather well, if I may say so myself.  The network was down for all of a day.  What a change from the non-existent network of yesteryear.  ISA was completely rebuilt within a day, and Mail, as far as I can see, has continued running without a hitch.  Computers are being patched and virus scanned at an amazing rate.  Meanwhile the network remains up, causing the least inconvenience to those already patched (or who don't need to be patched).  I must say, we are all very impressed.  Still no news on the suspended teachers.
