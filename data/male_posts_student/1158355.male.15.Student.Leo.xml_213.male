But first I have to mention yesterday in gym this kid threw a water bottle at a goose and it fell on the ground and layed there for like 10 seconds and then ran away all weird. It was the funniest gym experience ever. Ok so back to this night. BANDS OF THE BULL. I only watched a few bands. It was very annoying when Aftermath came on and little freshman faggets were standing up talking and not caring. Alot of girls in my grade too. So I stood up and said SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO THE MUSIC OR GET THE HELL OUT. I hate them. The freshman are just annoying freshman, they can't help it but the girls in my grade, GOD! They completely ignores the band and talks standing up in the middle of the row. Why are they there you ask? Because their lives are pointless. Anyone who doesn't have music in their life has pretty much a pointless life. Music or sports which is why do drums, it's music and it's athletic...sort of. So...I performed for Black Magic when they sang Come Together I sang the chorus. Then Justin Schreck never showed up for Aftermath which has an incredible singer. Candice, she's a goddess and so much power in her voice, she should do American Idol. Anyways, Justin didn't show up to sing Enter Sandman by Metallica with her so she just yelled at for anyone to come up and sing with her. So I ran up and people followed me and I grabbed the mic. It was godlike. Being on stage is awesome. Candice sang this one song that sounded so professional it was unbelievable. And also there was a random drum ensemble and I played a recyclying bin with a mallet and at the end they hit a huge gong. I hung out with Heaton, James, Paul, Steve, Rob, Dan and other people. Tomorrow should be awesome. It's gonna be me, Heaton James and Paul tomorrow night in our new band. YES.
