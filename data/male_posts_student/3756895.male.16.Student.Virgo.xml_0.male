Hopefully my memory wouldn't fail me tomorrow. Played SG since 3 hours ago. Fooking lvl up quite fast. Finally got a MK4 Owl - 5k HP 57 Armor and also MK3 Leviathan - 6k HP 49 Armor. Fooking. Can finally do something as a clouter for my regiment. Feeling hungry the whole day today... Wonder whether I'll be putting on weight soon... Hope not though. I intend to ask my frens to chiong cs and wc3 tml. Lol. Gonna enjoy myself hard this weekend. Almost all polys are gonna start... I'll just have to ask my best frens out before we really can't make out time to go for some gathering anymore... Just hope we all will keep in touch with one another always. Friends forever~ ;)
