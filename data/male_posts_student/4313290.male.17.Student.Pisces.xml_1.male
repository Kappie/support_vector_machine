Marx was a marxist, he said that all wealth comes from labor, and he's right. maybe dad says though that it takes a creative person, who takes a risk, to start that business, and he's right. but i believe industry emerges as it is demanded, so that initial creative, risk taking, business starter will come inevitably, and huge wealth cannot be made without a huge infrastructure, and that takes labor. then...Locke said that a just government should, and only sould, protect the "life, liberty, and property" of those over which it governs. This is true too, and it should do no more, because when it starts developing socialistic programs, not all benefit equally, and in fact some dont benefit at all, and in super fact, some are hurt by this (the wealthy) because they pay their taxes so that others (sometimes they deserve it, but many dont) can get what they need. anyway, government programs are a different topic, but thats what i extract from the teachings of Locke. then there is jefferson, third president, idealistic scholar. he believed there should be routine revolutions, continuously changing, checking, and improving the system. I think its time that people realize just how dramatically the role of our government has changed, how much closer its come to the soviet union than it originally was intended to be a conglomeration of x number of states, each strongly independent of the rest, yeilding to a federally enforced constitution. anyway so to tie it all up, from Marx you have labor, and i say, let the labor keep all it makes, let people keep all their wealth, and let them manage their own lives, whether they end up dying somehow (irresponsibility). if they manage themselves, those who are responsible will survive, bang, a strong population. From Locke, a government that protects the life, liberty, and property of the governed. let the people form their own protective structure, let them join in a social contract with themselves, to ensure their protection of these things, let them invest in it themselves, and let those who dont want to be apart of it fend for themselves. let these people then manage it, not millionare politicians who become senators and presidents to protect their businesses. And from Jerfferson, the people must work together, care for their nation, care for themselves and their self interest, and each other, the people, the working people, the thinkers, the soldiers,  they all must depend on each other, and they should form their own protective body, which serves only the purposes proposed by Locke, and they should pay their leaders only a little, to ensure that only the most loyal-to-ideas people take office. in history, we've seen socialist revolutions, i cant think of many linertarian revolutions, lets at least try one. girls are kind of annoying, they tell secrets and stuff right as ur watching and then dont talk to you, show some interst if you are interested!!! i watched a movie with winson, requiem for a dream, it was awesome and sad but really good.
