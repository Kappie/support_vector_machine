It was a pretty normal day; went to school, did ass all, shot some targets and came home. Then in about 40 mins I'm off to  urlLink Young Enterprise  (a thing where people of my age get together and form a company, where we've got re-elections. The nerves are staring to creep in!  I also phoned up a travel agent for a quote on two round the world flight tickets for my gap year, which came to about Â£1100 each. That sounds a lot, but it's for the following flights: UK -> Sydney, Sydney -> Auckland, Auckland -> Vancouver, Toronto -> UK. Not bad, I thought. Plus I can also get 30% off the quoted price thorugh a friend, which will prove very useful with our ever-inflating costs. It'll be worth it though; I can't wait to phone home whilst standing on top of  urlLink Uluru !!
