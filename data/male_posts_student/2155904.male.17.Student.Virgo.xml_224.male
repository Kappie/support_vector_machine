Yesterday he went to London and took a few subways and trains in order to get there.  He saw Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, Parliament, and all of that kind of thing (he doesn't actually remember everything so he will leave it at that).  But it was pretty good.  And guess who Tyke saw at Buckingham Palace...yeah, none other than XXX, Vin Diesel.  Yeah, that was a little weird but he got some pics of him anyway so that was fun.  The scenery was really nice in London.  In one spot there was quite a few "adult" shops which were pretty funny to look at.  There were some girls standing outside the stores and walking by all those places with your mother is a little bit awkward.  It was funny.  After that Tyke got a Strawberries and Cream Frappucino at Starbucks (tastes just like a strawberry milkshake) and then he came home.  It was a good day though.  And today they went back to London.  This time Tyke went to the Tower of London (not that fun really but still got to see all the crown jewels) and also went to Greenwich and some other place.  It was decent.  The weather was really nice but all in all it wasn't as fun as yesterday.  A lot more walking today but Tyke is feeling better today so that means he is once again the most fit person here (his brother is out doing his own thing most of the time).  Tomorrow the family hops on a train for Edinburgh, Scotland and while there Tyke will get to see some cool scenery.  It's gonna be pretty good.  Hopefully they will be able to get back to England/France without being hurt by the rail strike coming up.  But the trip is getting better and Tyke can't believe it's already been 9 days.  He has another 10 more coming up though so he's really just halfway done.  Tyke's mom just took a picture of him.  She's crazy.  Tyke has been a master photographer for this trip.  Oh yeah, they went to Stowe Gardens today and that is a really picturesque area.  Great for picnics or just walking around.  There were two swans and their babies, or signets, swimming across a pond with a waterfall in the background...magnificent.  To sorta wrap it all up, the trip is getting better but now they move on to a new foreign area where Tyke will get to try to meet some new girls ;).  No luck so far.  It seems as though it is prom or something here because there are a lot of girls and guys dressed up and walking around outside.  Hmmm...whatev.  Ok, as much as you must want Tyke to keep writing, he is going to sign off now.  Hey Hun, thanks for the comments, good to know you're keeping up!
