A Classic Rock band that was formed in the late 70s, consisting of  urlLink Mark Knopfler  as the composer, producer and lead musician on lead/rhythm guitars, vocals; his brother  urlLink David Knopfler  on rhythm guitars, Pick Withers on drums, and John Illsley on bass. I say Classic Rock merely for saying it. After all, genres are just interpretations. Morever, in reality, only the first three or four Straits albums can be categorized as Classic Rock. The band broke sometime in the 90s when Knopfler went solo. For many Straits fans, Dire Straits was nothing but another name for Mark Knopfler, who with his legendary guitaring, made it a one-man show. And although Straits was, and will always remain essentially  MK , the equation holds true because of the fact that Knopfler overrode everyone in the band; all others were puppets. In fact the names of all four appear only on their first two albums,  urlLink Dire Straits  and  urlLink Communique . David doesn't appear on  urlLink Making Movies  and  urlLink Love Over Gold , their next two albums, (although it somehow seemed he was a part of Making Movies too), whereas Pick Withers left the band after the fourth album, since he wanted to do more  serious  music. Both were hugely talented in their own domains. According to hardcore Straits followers, the truth was that David was always a better musician than Mark, even though Mark was a better guitarist. Straits sounds beautiful because of initially David Knopfler's rhythm guitars and Pick Withers' drums. When they left, the sound changed, the guitars changed. Straits never became as profound as someone like  urlLink Pink Floyd , a real travesty. When I started with Straits, I thought I might as well hear all their stuff, and to date I have almost their entire collection. Why move the mine when you've find the gold? Really, there is no other sound in music like Dire Straits, the guitaring is totally unique, one can't even compare or find similar bands. That's a problem in a way, as a friend said:  "After you finish hearing all of it, you can't have anything else which is similar!" . Paradoxically speaking, Straits is instant gratification which somehow lasts long!  Mark Knopfler was the guy who told the sound crew at concerts to  "keep the sound low so that people can talk to each other".  The sound crew said  "Dude, you are a rock star man".  A  urlLink picture  of MK is incomplete without his headband, and his famous  red  urlLink strat  , which he unfortunately stopped playing, after the fourth album; the clean, electric strat. Guitarists say that MK's talent is recognisable more if one is a guitarist, otherwise the beauty of his solos are lost on you, they just  sound nice . MK was known more of a  guitarist's guitarist , as opposed to someone like  urlLink Santana  who is more of a  people's guitarist . MK has been criticised many times for writing stuff that only guitarists will appreciate, even though his work still is easy and simple enough for people to  like  and doesnt get too complex with structures and patterns. MK was inspired by  urlLink Bob Dylan , who, to many, was the father of Classic Rock. Recently I heard one of Dylan's songs. Without doubt, in Sultans of Swing, MK sounds very much like Dylan. The talkback style is extremely vintage, and although MK's vocals were never extraordinary, they were fitting enough. Lately, MK not only sings, he croons, notably in his 2002 solo album -  urlLink The Ragpickers Dream . Gone are those long solo sessions. Instead its more of  singing , even though the subtle licks still remain. With  urlLink Golden Heart , his second solo album, his music exhibited a combination of country-ish, irish/celtic pop and rock. Its boring, since its too much oldies music. The strat is nowhere to be seen.  Knopfler is one of the few guitarists in rock who plays primarily with fingers. His guitar sounds like  many , even though in reality its just  one , since finger-plucking is equivalent to having four  urlLink plectrums  (or picks). To my knowledge, most other rock solos are with a plectrum. If one tries to combine and learn both its hard to be good enough to play the solos. The art of finger-plucking or playing  only  with fingers, turns the guitar into a totally different instrument. MK plays it like a piano. The thumb gives the base, the fingers give melody, at the same time! Knopfler can never play as fast as most other rock legends, but its just a choice one makes, of beauty vs. speed. So far as I understand, plectrum gets mechanical, though it has its beautiful points too. With a plec one can attack strings, something that is not possible with fingers because fingers run only in one direction whereas a plec runs in both directions. Knopfler rarely goes speedy, its all about the  subtle feel . And then he sacrifices the lightning speed a plectrum gives, by making it up with  urlLink pulloffs and hammers . If you follow his music closely, his stuff has nice progressions and bridges, some lovely transitions. The uniqueness lies in the fact that he bends more than one string at a time. Most of the time, there are simultaneous bends on many strings, and the intensity of bend on each string is different. I talked to a couple of serious guitarist friends and they said that MK is nice and melodious, but not outrageously progressive, not too risky. Plays a  safe  style of guitar. Of course, any good guitarist worth his salt can play with fingers, but Knopfler goes way way ahead of that. Listen closely to some of his numbers, and you will see the fillers in between the leads. The fillers come from the same guitar, he's just plucking away subconsciously. Leads are conscious, the subconscious fillers are the awesome part. They are spontaneous, and that's the secret!    urlLink DIRE STRAITS (The Album)    Their first self-titled album in 1978 is perhaps their least popular of all, from the masses point of view, although ask any fervent Straits fan and they'll tell you that it is vintage Straits. My favorite album. The album picks up with the song  Down to the Waterline . It is the most awesome way to start liking Straits. Their first release. Lovely chords. David Knopfler strikes them just at the right time to complement the lyrics. Hardcore Dire Straits. The best lineup you could ever get. A legendary introductory song. Unbelieveable riffs, a complex bridge, and serious crazy  urlLink damping . Guitarists bend one string at time, Knopfler usually bends two or three at a time. Its tabla on a guitar, sounds like a tabla! - Just before  "Sweet surrender on the quayside..." . The foghorn sound at the start of waterline is a guitar too. Knopfler did it on his guitar, but its not audible on ordinary speakers. Its one of those fancy tricks that he did only during vintage days, later on, he got too mature to do that stuff. And then ofcourse, Straits' baby so to speak, the song -  Sultans of Swing . An outright breezy number, Sultans was originally written for acoustic, but the leads came out properly on a fender strat. It has some tremendous pulloffs and hammers, and MK seems to be doing relatively little with his right hand. But its a pity that Straits is known only for Sultans in the masses - its my least favorite song from the album. There is some equally great if not better guitaring in  Setting me up  and  Southbound again . In southbound there's a continous rhythm guitar going on, its faint, but constant. And then Six blade knife; only one word to describe that song -  subtlety . There are some amazing nuances and subtleties in this song which normal speakers fail to capture properly. The licks/riffs are all  urlLink harmonics . MK plays the guitar such that the fundamental frequency of the string is muffled, but the smaller vibrations of the string  continue resonating. The guitar fades away, reappears, fades again...extremely subtle variations, lot of multiple bends. Throughout the song he's scratching on the guitar. Totally maddening effects.     urlLink MAKING MOVIES    Their third album has two wonderfully composed songs.  Romeo and Juliet  and  Skateaway . The first one is a beautiful ballad. Sweet, soothing guitar. Skateaway happens to be one of his complex compositions. Very fine guitar interludes backed up by equally good drumming.    urlLink LOVE OVER GOLD    Their fourth album, Love Over Gold contains even more beautiful Dylan-esque songs. Knopfler almosts sounds like Dylan. It contains another legendary intro song called  Telegraph Road , which is a 15 minute number containing three great solos. It has an interesting bit of history associated with it which you can find  urlLink here . The album is hugely underrated. Has only 5 songs but the band spent a year on it and labelled it as their most ambitious project. This album has Alan Clark on the keyboards and Hal Lindes on the rhythm guitar for the first time. The entire album has an atmospheric feel to it.  Private Investigations ,  Love Over Gold  and  It Never Rains  are the other three picks. If waterline had a tabla on a guitar, in It Never Rains, MK's guitar sounds as if it is  singing . All songs have truly incredible solos.    urlLink ALCHEMY    I haven't heard all of Alchemy but have checked a couple songs from it. An album that doesnt sound as catchy since it is live, but the atmosphere is worth it.  "Not a pick in site" , is how they advertised Alchemy. And sure enough, there were no plectrums to be found anywhere. Knopfler threw one into the crowd just before the concert and started some finger control exercises driving the crowd mad. Then he stretched his hands out, relaxed, and started playing  Once upon a time in the west  all by himself. They say that it was the first live album which wasn't edited after recording. You will find the band actually making mistakes while they played!    urlLink BROTHERS IN ARMS    The album that rocketed Straits to popularity. They got commercialized. My least favorite album. In fact it is not at all trademark Straits. It has a few good numbers such as  So far away  and  Brothers in arms , but lacks the punch and the vintage style. Songs like  Money for nothing  and  Walk of life  were big hits. But those are nothing but nursery pop when you look back at the original Straits.    urlLink ON EVERY STREET    The last of the Straits' albums. Again, very experimental. Not exactly vintage, but still in a class of its own! MK used a gibson style guitar for this. Starts of well with  Calling Elvis . Good rhythm.  On every street  has a short but good solo. A lot of the songs in this album too are very ambient and atmospheric, very haunting.  You and your friend  and  Iron hand  have typical finger-plucking. I already talked about  The Bug  and  Ticket to Heaven . Probably my pick of the album is  Planet of New Orleans . The song is supposed to have wierd, complex chords. Great sax and guitar combo.    urlLink SULTANS OF SWING: THE VERY BEST OF DIRE STRAITS    Again, an album that was compiled for the box office. Doesn't contain much of the vintage works. But has a lovely, (live) song called  Local Hero . Just MK and his guitar. The last song of the album but which probably deserves a better rating.    urlLink SAILING TO PHILADELPHIA   and   urlLink GOLDEN HEART    Sailing is an exceptionally phenomenal solo album, and I am running out of space, time, words,  and energy to dissect any more of his songs. Golden Heart on the other hand was nothing too spectacular, although it has its fair share of good songs like the  Golden Heart  and one called  Vic and Ray . More celtic than any other album.    urlLink NECK AND NECK    Not a Dire Straits' album, but has MK and  urlLink Chet Atkins  going crazy on guitars. Its a guitar jugalbandi in Indian terms. It has a piece called  I'll see u in my dreams , which is only guitar. The album is proper country guitaring, serious guitar picking. Chet Atkins, himself a country guitarist and a legend in his own right, taught Knopfler. It has some slow numbers here and there, but in between are some unbelievable and long guitar jams. The first guitar solo of the first song -  Poor boy blues , MK just  takes off  into the first solo.    Summing up my longest blog    From what I gather, what MK/Straits does is inspire people to start learning guitar, which is the most amusing thing. I wouldn't have learnt guitar otherwise. In fact I keep hearing from people that one good thing Straits does to you, is when you are through with it (which is a hard thing in itself); in a few years, one is prepared for much more complex music, which otherwise is not as easy to understand/like. Straits has a typical sound which if you like, you will like most of it.  Getting into Straits is a smooth ride like none other. I will perhaps never enjoy any other band so much. People tell me that Straits will educate me, as a favor to me. By the time I am through with it, I'll understand  urlLink chord progressions . Its a slow process, and if one is not obsessed about a band, one doesn't take the trouble to understand it. Its infinitely complex. You derive something out of it, only after you listen more and more to it. Eventually a day comes when you listen and know what each instrument is doing exactly. To put this in computer lingo, its all about parallel processing; equalizing mentally. For instance when to have the drums and guitar  UP , bass  DOWN , rhythm  UP ......  Whatever you say, I'll be indebted to Mark Knopfler for the rest of my life.
