i would either destroy the world completely or try to find some way to acheive peace. maybe 1 or 2 people i wouldn't be all that friendly to, but they deserve it ^_^.   3) what would you do if you got drafted by the army? umm...i would fight in the war and hope i don't die.   4) what would you do if nuclear war broke out? what can i do? not much, i guess try to find a safe place to hide with my family and friends.   5) what would you do if aliens attacked? tell carie that her real family had come back for her   6) what would you do if the internet crahsed forever? that would not be good, i would loose all forms of contact with some of my friends. i guess i'd have to learn how to dial a phone.   7) what would you do if all forms of elecrticity stopped working forever? i would slip into a coma and die, what did you think i'd do, party?   8) what would you do if you went blind? that would kinda suck, i wouldn't be able to read or play videogames, and i wouldn't be able to see my friends, but i guess i would be okay if i could still hear them.   9) what would you do if you went deaf? that wouldn't be as bad as going blind, i just wouldn't be able to listen to music and would have to learn sign language, not hearing music would be the worst of it.  10) what would you do if you went blind and deaf? that would just completely suck, i don't know how i would get by without being able to see or hear the people that i love and care about.  11) what would you do if all of your friends ditched you? friends? since when did i have friends? well i guess i have 1 or 2, but them didtching me wouldn't really be that much of a suprise.  12) what would you do if you found out one of your friends was madly in love with you? depends on which friend, some it wouldn't be that bad, but most of my friends...i'd probably either scream and runn away in fear or just slap them.  13) what would you do if kerry was elected? i have to agree with chris, moving to Japan would be good here, but maybe some other country where i actually speak the language would be a better idea.  14) what would you do if gay marriage was legalized? personally i belive that marrage is something that should be between a man and a woman, but i would really do anything.  15) what would you do if you went to sleep and woke up 20 years later? that wouldn't suprise me much if i did that. i'd just try to track down all my family and friends and hope that they're allright after so long, but in 20 years i doubt if they would remember me at all.  16) what would you do if you went to sleep and woke up 100 years later? i don't think i would be able to go on if all of my friends and loved ones were gone, i really don't know what i'd do, other than checking out all the cool new technology of course.  17) what would you do if you found out you had to retake all of school from kindergarten on up? taking kindergarten as a 17 year old would not be good, i think i'd run away. but if it meant that i could start my life over from kindergarten, i would try to remember to neve, ever let go of the people that mean the most to you, it just isn't possible to find anyone to replace them, ever.  18) what would you do if the was nothing to eat in the house but SPAM? fried spam is pretty good, but i think i would try to go buy som eother food as soon as possible, i don't know how ling i could stand eating nothing but spam.  19) what would you do if you were in a foreign country and couldn't speak the language at all? i can barely speak the language in THIS country! just kidding, i would probably get lost and start asking for for someone who spoke english and have people laugh at me.   20) what would you do if all your friends forgot who you were? actually many of them already have forgotten who i am, but i would probably just try t make them remeber, if that didn't work then...then well it would not be fun now would it?  21) what would you do if YOU forgot who you were? actually sometimes i forget my own name, that comes from not having anyone to talk to most of the time.but really, if i forgot who I was then i probably wouldn't remeber that i had to do something about it.  22) what would you do if you had to make a speach and completely forgot what you were gong to say? i would adlib and start babeling and wondering if i was spelling the word babeling right and eventually they would probably come and put a straight jacket on me and take me away.  23) what would you do if a guy in a squirell costume walked up to you and gave you a hug? i would freak  24) what would you do if you were really really bored? i would, well i would write this thing of course?  25) what would you do if i asked you to send this back to me with ALL the questions answered as seriously as you could? i'd say no, why should i send it to myself?
