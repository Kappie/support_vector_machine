After my experiences admiring the various bubbas of many nations on my flights out here, I am surprised to find none of the kids here being anything but offensive, ugly, blonds ruffians. All the more so, as I seem to be over my Northerner-phobia, and getting on OK with the rest of the monkeys. A lot of the girls under 25 even seem to be quite attractive.
