On Monday I had my "A" day classes. I don't rightly remember what I did in any of them. I think I did a quick image map in Web-page. It was almost a week ago, I don't remember that far back.  Tuesday I had "B" day classes. Interesting stuff. We read "The Crucible" on our own. I finished it because I was bored afterwards. Went to meet Dominique for lunch. I had a great time with her, as I always do.  Wednesday I had my "A" day classes, as the pattern implies. I think in web-page all I did was play Starcraft. It was already loaded to my computer, so I really didn't have to do anything.   Thursday; "B". In English we were finishing "The Crucible" on our own. Since I finished it already I was allowed to go to the library and get a book real quick. I got "On a Pale Horse" which I have already read. I started to read it, then stopped because I got bored. During lunch I spoke at Christian Club. It was fun, but I spoke for like 10 minutes. I wanted to speak for much longer. I visited Dominique and got to spend the lunch with her, just her and me.   Friday; if you don't know what kind of day it is by now, you need to go back to preschool and learn your patterns. In webpage all I did was help people out. I set up one of the computers. It didn't work so I didn't do anything for the rest of the period. Hopefully by Tuesday she will have had someone in there to get it to work. I don't really feel like doing it myself.  Saturday, I mean, today. I haven't really done much today. I talked with Dominique on the phone for a while. She is an awesome person, for those of you who don't know her. For those of you who do know her, you already know this.   Tomorrow is a youth run service at church. I am playing on the worship team and I am also playing for the offering song. It is going to be pretty cool.  Anyways, that's my week in two nutshells. I think I am going to go play some Tactics. I almost beat that game yesterday. I might try again today. I like it so much that I don't want to beat it yet.
