I'm gonna try and stay up as long as I can. See how long I can stay up. I'm hoping I can go from this morning 5 44 am to tomorrow night. That will be about 40 hours. Nice...hope I do it. Wish me luck with my lady fans down in Florida. They're all waiting for me down there, or so I extremely desire and wish...and other words. So I'm gonna miss everyone and I'm gonna miss James moving into his new house. Today I hung with Matt and Paul at Paul's. First it was me and Matt and my house but my dad kicked us out because I was NAUUUGHTY. Then I hung out with Dan for a while. Then I was gonna go to the movies but Amanda messed up the plans so I stayed home and finished my hw. Now I have to go to the bathroom really badly, then I'm off to Pat's to get my Matrix Comics. Bye everyone, type in this thing when I get back from paradise!  Every great band loves Satan. Funny, I like the backwards version alot better, and notice the forwards lyrics, "yes there are two paths"...forwards and backwards. and backwards it says "whos little path will make you sad...coincidence? nope. http://www2.memlane.com/jmilner/stairwaybackwards.htm
