I'm coasting right along in the Teddy biography.  He's just made his freshman presence felt at the New York Assembly at the tender age of 23, showing deep contempt for and butting heads on a regular basis with "machine politicians" of all affiliations.  Someday, I'd like to be able to do the same thing.  I... will probably explain my thoughts on that later.  Suffice it to say, it takes a shit-ton of guts to do what Sen. McCain (a self-described T.R. Republican) does.  Not to say I agree with his particular positions (especially on restriction of 1st amendment rights), but I have a hell of a lot of respect for the fact that he does take a stand against both parties when he feels it's warranted.  Not to be confused with Sen. Jeffords, who's just a political asshole. (I don't know him, so I can't speak to his actual personality.)  So I work tonight.  I think it might be fun.  I dunno.  At least it's not an 830-midnight cruise.  And I'm going home, I think, on Sunday, which will be great.  I've got a lot of Christmas shopping to do... which reminds me- I have to call Maria.  I can't wait to get home... Jess, Jesse, Bobbie, Steph, Jeff, Corey... they'll all be home.  Feels good listing Jeff on there.  We haven't hung out in forever.  I don't think I really had confidence that we'd ever hang out again after freshman year... and I haven't stopped thinking about that whole situation since then. (It's mentioned in an ealier blog... can't remember when, but it's in there somewhere)  Every day.  I know I've changed so much, and I hope that some sort of friendship can still be forged, because he was the best friend I ever had.   Alright.  Enough.  It's Christmas.  Christmas is happy... and it's time for renewal and forgiveness and all that... and things in my life are  so  good right now.  So I'll just hope for the best.  The power of positive thinking...  Speaking of renewal, forgiveness, et all, after work last night, I stopped in at The Point in Faneuil Hall where a few Gent alums had sung earlier in the night, and were hanging around, getting ready to leave.  I got a chance to talk to Shawn Wagner, Mike Michaud, Brian Bouvier, and Jon Villeneuve.  Shawn and I had a really nice talk... he and Kristy are getting engaged soon, which is fantastic.  It felt good to talk with him again.  It had been a long time, and I can't even remember if the last time we talked was pleasant or not.  For a while, anytime I talked to either Shawn or Jason, I had severe filters on, and I think I forced everything into being negative.  But I've been thinking a lot about my time at UNH and with the Gents lately, and realizing that as part of that period of my life, which was the pinnacle of my self-hatred, I made it impossible for either of them to reason with me.  I wasn't open to hearing what they had to say, which in retrospect, were things I needed to hear.  But at the same time, because of the stuff going on in my head at the time, I  couldn't  have heard them if I wanted to.  I had too much going on up there to allow anything like that.  I was in a severe self-preservation mode, and with all the things crashing into eachother in my head, I was incapable of just playing along with things.  What a mess.  I hope that this is the beginning of those things being cleared up, because I'd really love to be connected to the Gents again.  Shawn invited me to come play poker with him, Jason, Jim Tremblay and a few others, as well.  Not that I have any idea how to play, but I can learn, and I think it would be fun to get together with a few alums and reconnect.  Alright, that's enough for now.  Weird feeling going on for me in regards to the Sound right now.  Something sort of brewing that I shouldn't have a problem with, but yeah... I do.  I dunno.  Maybe I'll talk about it with a couple of you to figure out whether I'm out of line or not.  Also looking forward to hanging out with a couple other people who are coming home to the Boston area from school.  Off I go.  More Teddy, then work.  Yay work.  Heh.
