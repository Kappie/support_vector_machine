All wins. ^^ I just realised that I go to school wif something to look forward to : Weekend is coming soon. Lol. Can't wait for the weekend to come. The previous weekend passed pretty fast. Can't believe my ears when I heard my mum nagging about the start of the week on Sunday... Slept the whole day after school on Friday. Then, I went to Albert's house for class gathering last Saturday after going to school for A Levels Listening Comprehension. Spent the whole day in Albert's house. Was fun though. Played ps2 until my eyes turned fuking tired. Then Sunday came and I did my hw at 5pm as I slept until 4pm. =/ I'm becoming like a pig now... I just hope time passes fast enough. I really can't stand being in JC anymore. It SUX~ Like wad SC and Darius said, Poly>JC. It's so fuking true. ;(
