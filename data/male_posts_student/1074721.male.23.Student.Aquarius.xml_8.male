Both sides were really equal, but Porto took their chances with perfection. I thought the injury to Monaco's captain in the first half hit them really hard and their top players did not perform to the occasion.   Well as far as the rest of the day is concerned, waited and waited for Himanshu (friend from school) to turn up ... but he did not come ..... Really i am very angry as he made me get up early in the morning ( 9 am :(( ) and then i was sitting like a fool expecting him :(   Anyway .. tommorrow hopefully i will get a second telephone line, and then be able to be online practically 24X7 ......    Cioa for now    Mihir
