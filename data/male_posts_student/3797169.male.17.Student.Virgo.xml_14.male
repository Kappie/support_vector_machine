In particular a: 2001 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD 6.6L Duramax Diesel engine Allison automatic transmission  I'd do a lot of things to it, add horsepower, wheels and tires, give it some good looks and all; but one question still remains.  Do I lift it, or lower it?  I say lift and I think about off-roading, takin' a bike out to the desert and just riding for hours...or going out camping with friends up at a lake somewhere, sounds nice right?  But then I say lower and I think of how cool it would look. Why do I care what other people think. yeah it would look nice, but if I'm gettin the HD, I don't think there'd be much use in lowering it.  I guess that answers my question. Lift it!  Maybe a Fabtech Motorsports 8" lift w/ dual Bilstein long travel, remote reservoir shocks and Superlift rear leaf springs.  Sounds nice...I'll update you as the story goes, yeah?  Adios until next time...
