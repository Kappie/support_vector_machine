So should not be a problem for me. Neway, I'm going to have supervised self-study programme, and I am so sianzzz coz I wont be able to slp late on sat and missed out on lots of things going on on sat like soccer match and slp. Neway, hope I will gain something out of it all. Today in school seems so interesting as compare to other days coz I have decide to buck up and score "A"s for my "O's so mayb tats why it is so much more interesting. If not sure doze off 1. Well, time for me to go
