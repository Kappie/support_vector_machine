Art Stream students supposedly to possess better linguistic ability? l0lx.. in any case, my language has seriously improved by leaps and bounds.. thinking that i was previously from the last class of the english streaming in my secondary school days.. haha.. l0lx   anyway, i did not go to school again today.. take it as i play truancy bahz.. haiz, hopefully no teachers or watsoeva crap will read my blog.. haha, frankly, i was really tired today.. wanted to make use of the day to study for my econs QA but in e end, fell aside on my bed... surprising, i woke up at 2pm... given the fact tt i slept relatively early last night.. wateva it is, time has past.. haha..   heard tt the teachers have given us back all our mid-yrs and it's not really well done.. haha, nvm.. i going sch early tml to collect my scripts den.. for all, good ntiez to all! byE~
