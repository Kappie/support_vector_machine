I like Vejoda better, it has a certain swoon to it that drives the ladies crazy.  "Greetings Mr. Vejoda, you're weapons grade uranium will be here shortly. We had an incident with the Bosnian rebels which caused a minor delay. *grins* Needless to say the rebels were crushed and the convoy swiftly on its way."  "Good, good, Mr. Gerasimov. *gunshot* Not good enough though *evil hearty laugh*"  Man, that rules. So yeah suposedly there's a Vejoda Hotel in Prague or something, and a street, so if you're ever in the Czech Republic I'll hook you up.
