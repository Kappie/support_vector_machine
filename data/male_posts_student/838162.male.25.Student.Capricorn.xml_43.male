They are both local blogs to sorta make up for the lost of two other local blogs which have now become overseas blogs.heh. All the best over there you guys.  Firstly we have  urlLink Lianne  who I feel writes with a simplicity and honesty that is embodied by the layout and desing of her blog, with a healthy dose of cynicism that gives her words an edge.  Next we have  urlLink skinthrills  and a lovely pink and functional blog. Love all the links and features on the sidebar. Most importantly, she writes with a style that is smooth, causal and lighthearted. Worth checking out  I hope everyone welcomes them and take the time to check out their blogs. It's good to encourage people who have taken the time to share with us their thoughs and feelings and willing to open them up for discussion and new insights.
