Do you remember the sense of wonder at the vibrant colors of your early youth, when discovery still meant dabbing your fingers in the paint and spreading your vision across lines and pictures?             Do you remember the depth of your first love, the one you’d love forever, the one you’d always go back to?             Do you remember the fascination of the first movie you saw?  The first faerie tale you heard while being tucked into bed?             Do you remember all of these things?              Because somewhere, down inside of you, there’s a part of you that still yearns for them.  It’s the part that shivers with anticipation when you just know that something will never happen, yet you expect it anyway.  It’s the bit that gazes in wonder when you see something new and magnificent for the first time.  It’s where you go when start terror takes away your breath and makes you look inside yourself at the truth, too.             It’s not always comfortable or nice.  Sometimes it’s downright scary.  But it’s something bigger, something you can’t ignore; it touches something primal.  It’s in everyone, and that’s why we’re all part of it.             You probably go to a regular job, drive a somewhat used car and watch recycled sitcoms on TV.  You eat at fast-food restaurants or occasionally grab something at the grocery store.  Maybe your play some computer games, and you pay your taxes and have a driver’s license.             All in all, a very normal life.  Normal.  Boring.  Mundane.             So what’s the point?  Are you content to live as a slave to same culture and technology that’s perpetuated itself for a thousand years now?  Do you really find satisfaction in following all the laws, filling out all the forms, paying the same bills month to month and drowning in the stifling conformity and bureaucracy?             Oh.  You rooted for the underdog on Survivor.  You watched Babylon 5.  You read a couple Tolkien books.  Good for you.             What happened to the faerie tales and ghost stories?  Where did the sense of wonder go?  Did you ever even bother to look back and think, “Fuck, why is my life so goddamn pathetic?  How come there’s nothing special?  Why aren’t there any heroes any more?”  Or do you even care enough to think about it?  Are you so content that you’ll sit on your ass and not even wonder about it? Because there is something more.  Those people out there who believe in aliens, crystals, God, reincarnation, spirits, spells and spooks may be whacked, but they aren’t necessarily wrong.  What’s something you believed that you never told anyone?  Did you think you saw something not quite human out of the corner of your eye once?  Could you swear that sometimes you dream things and they just happen later?  Do you ever get that chill that just runs down your spine for no reason and turn around to see someone watching you?  Ever listen to some people talking and think how odd that they have voices just like your friends?  Did you look up at the stars and swear you saw something moving that wasn’t just a plane?  Yeah, everyone’s done it.  And you never tell anyone, because you’re afraid that it’ll sound stupid or crazy.  But it’s not.  It’s all true.              It’s time to break out of that shell of mediocrity.  The world bombards you with messages telling you about the horrors of starvation and barbarism, instructing you in how good your life is and how much better this modern age of technology is than the so-called “Dark Ages.”  What’s the point in a boring, semi-comfortable life of bleary oblivion?             Yes, There are risks.  There really are terrible things waiting in the shadows, read to eat you and turn your world on its head.  You also take a risk every time you cross the street, or get on an airplane, or go to the bank where a whacko with a gun might shoot you.  So what would you rather do – live and die in mediocrity, or take charge of your life, make your own decisions, decide on the risks you want, and see what the world really has to offer?             You never took that trip to Europe because you were afraid you couldn’t afford it.  You didn’t ask out that sweet little number at the bar, because you were afraid of rejection. You never tried that join your friends were passing around because you were afraid of getting caught or hooked.  Are you gonna go to your grave with the comment “Here lies a boring person who was afraid to live?”  Maybe you will.             But maybe you won’t.  Maybe, just maybe, you will find the courage to take that plunge and to do something a little differently.  Break a few rules, Walk on the edge.  Believe in something better than this gray homogenous crap that the world keeps trying to shovel at you.             That’s why we’re here.  We’ve taken that step, and we’ll help you to take it, too.  We don’t promise that it will be safe, comfortable or easy.  But if you make the most of it, it will be more than worth it.  Together with us, you can make the world something better.
