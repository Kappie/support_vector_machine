He was there for the monthly collection. In the distance Gwen saw a deer near the trees in her front yard, so she assumed that was why tweezer was barking. "Hi," said Gwen cheerfully. "Hello there...uh...I'm here for the monthly collection," said Tommy. Gwen giggled softly. "Of course," she answered him, "just a minute, come in and have a seat if you'd like." "Sure," he replied nervously. He walked in and had a seat in chair.  Gwen went to her mom's desk and got the sealed envelope labeled "paperboy" on the front. She returned and gave it to Tommy.  "Hey, maybe you can come with me and Philip when we go on our adventure today," she stated. "Umm...Okay, I guess. I'll ask my mom if I can go," he said blushing slightly and smiling sheepishly. "Cool, we're leaving at eight, so hurry up and come back over here as soon as you finish your route and talk to your mom." "You got it!"  Then he left. As soon as he was gone, Gwen finished her small breakfast and rushed to her room to get ready to go. She packed a small backpack of stuff to take including: bottled water, a first aid kit, and a map.  A little later the phone rang and she answered it. It was Tommy calling to say he would be there at 7:45. She was so excited! Could the planned adventure be any better? Gwen waited and waited. Finally, it was 7:45, and Tommy and Philip were nearly ready to go. The three decided not to take Tweezer on this adventure. It would be such a long one, and Tweezer had trouble at really rocky parts. Philip promised to Tweezer that he would take him on a hike the next day. They were ready to leave, the adventure had just begun!
