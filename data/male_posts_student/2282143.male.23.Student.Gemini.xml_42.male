According to Jim, I could have gone out to Gurnee and gotten it for $25, but with the gas, time, and tax?  I think I done good.  Some chump tried to outbid me at the last second, literally. But thankfully my proxy was an increment higher than his.  Sucka...  Oh well, time for homework before I lay down some asskicking tonight.  Pending my knee of course...
