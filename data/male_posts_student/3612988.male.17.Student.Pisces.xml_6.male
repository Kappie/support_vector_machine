Ubin. lots and lots...:D  thoughts of the day: this is what alex told me...he said the guys in mixed schools when talking to other guys, more superficial in speech, as compared to guys from boy school. because they lack the kind of brotherly bonds between them.  people from mix school are more untrusting and are always to  conscious of themselves that they appear to be very "fake" as in their expression of thoughts may not be exactly what they think lor. well there can be exceptions. by me!
