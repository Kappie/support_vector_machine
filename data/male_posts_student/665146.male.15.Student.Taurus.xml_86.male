Jarring, discordant sound; dissonance or  The use of harsh or discordant sounds in literary composition, as for poetic effect.   As in: A  cacophony  of horns rang during the traffic jam.          or          The harsh  cacophony  of voices gave texture to the piece.  See?  I give to the community.  Fuck you, Word of the Day calendars.  That's right, "Fuck you, Word of the Day calendars."  Fuck, defined as:      Wait, no way am I defining fuck, I'll be typing all damn night.     INSIDE JOKE:  "And she's climbing the stairway to heaven." Only you, Aidan.  Only you...
