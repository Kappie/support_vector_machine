This has been killing my social skills, but I guess its alright.  I've also had to read books up the fashizzy, like All Quiet on The Western Front, Huckleberry Finn, and The Great Gatsby.  I'm getting sick of reading, but luckily the semester is coming to a close soon.  The Swing has been my prime entertainment so far this month. It is actually quite fun to swing, and to try to invent new tricks, but it is also quite dangerous, but it's the risk factor that keeps us alive.  also I beat  urlLink Fishy!!!!   Aliright im out peeps                                                                     716-2603
