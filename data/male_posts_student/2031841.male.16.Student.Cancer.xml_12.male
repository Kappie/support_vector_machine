To be sure, I haven't finished the whole thing, but I did finish the section called 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'  They are rather odd mysteries.  Some I like better than others.  I do love, however, how no matter what the character, even if it's a minor character with two lines that never appears again, the author makes that person believable.  I do find Holmes annoying at times, and I love and pity poor Watson.  Always, in the mysteries, the author withholds one vital clue.  You can generally figure out what's going on, but not the particulars.   Anyway, that's my take on things.
