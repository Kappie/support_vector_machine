I arrive there around 10:00pm, after Lauren and her friends' plan of having a surprise party for Bob was foiled by [SMUT] not going to the planned dinner.  Instead, when I got there, I see Reza passed out on the couch, and Bob's U-Albany friends Erek and Jeff in attendance.  All of the drinks were free, which was a plus for my cheap self; and since everyone was already drunk or on something..  I soon found out later that Dr. Smut was on shrooms, which turned out to be devastating..  He was very violent, and punching and throwing things; oh well.  All in all it was a fun night, except for the fact that my girlfriend had to leave kind of early.. But Danny was there, so that was a plus having him witness our absurdity; apparently he likes how I am so disrespectful when I am drunk... The downstairs is still kind of disorderly.  I want to move the computer out of here, but I don't know where I possibly could put it, so I might just not end up doing it...  Oh yeah, and I was sent to time-out 3rd period today in English; by a substitute.  Substitutes are dumb, and he had a grudge against me ever since I walked into that classroom.  Oh well, I hope I make top 20 on Thursday and that mumble-fuck sees my picture on some wall or yearbook.  Take that to what kind of person you thought I was, bitch ass scrubstitute.
