After the tournament, Dan handed out ballots for voting for mvp, most improved, and all that other stuff...yeah that didnt take very long for me, i basically put myself in every catagory except for most improved and i think one other one, but i forget. Hhhhanywayz, overall our team has come a long way from the beginning of season, especially the ppl that really sucked...like spencer, graeme, and joe(i guess). I guess i improved a lot on my hitting, but i greatly improved on my passing. I shall post u my final season stats as soon as i get them, cuz im coo like that. Well, as one season ends, another one begins, which is the Oxnard High School team. All i know is...we're gonna kick some ass this year...league is in the bag...cif championship is a very reachable goal, and i know that we can achieve it cuz our team kicks ass. So i guess the future does have its bright sides. Also my grades kick ass...2 Bz and 4 Az...FUCK YEAH!!...well i might post somethin later, but until then....the saga continues.
