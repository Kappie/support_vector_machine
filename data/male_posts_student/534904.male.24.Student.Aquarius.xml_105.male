So why am I suddenly overcome by this paranoia that she doesn't want to continue and develop the relationship any further? We get on well together, and we enjoy each other's company to a degree I've never experienced before. There's a very definate physical attraction too.  These are all good points. Very good points. Points that have never really come up with any other girl.    So why do I have this impending sense of doom?  All I can think of is when I see her next, her sitting me down and telling me that she doesn't want to see me.  There's been absolutely no indication of her intending this to happen, or even of any negative vibes from her, but I can't help worrying myself sick over the possibility.  I guess this is what happens after so many years of being involuntarily single, you get used to rejections, and expect them to happen.     *Happy thoughts, Happy thoughts...*      "I must keep reminding myself of this..."      -MJ Keenan
