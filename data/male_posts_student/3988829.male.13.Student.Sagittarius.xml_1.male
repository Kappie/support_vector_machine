After such aillustrious start to the season, winning all of our first five games, our unbeaten record ground to a halt when we were beaten 3-2 by Green Bay High today.  Maybe I underestimated them or something. Two different referees were meant to control the game; thecoach of the home team manages the first half and the away coach manages the second. But our coachwas injuredso the home referee had to referee both halves.  It was terrible from the start. After only about 10 minutes of playing aGreen Bay striker latched ontoa well-played pass andthundered the ball into the net. I was sooo so so close to reaching it; it virtually brushed my fingertips as it whizzed into the net.  About three minutes later theyscored again, this time from a corner. One of their strikers was clinging onto me like a barnacle so it really bugged me. As the corner camenear me, I pushed it outwards with my hand but an opponent rushed in to score and make it 2-0 to Green Bay at half-time.  By now I was desperate. I have never felt like this before because we have never experienced losing or drawing; only winning. I remembered that legendary goalkeeper David Seaman lost his first Junior School League game 26-0 (it's true!), and this spurred me on somehow. I also remembered those games where one team is leading 3-0 at half-time,then the other team comes from behind to win 4-3 (like the FA Cup one between Manchester City and Tottenham). This encouraged me also. There was a growing hope inside me that made me realise that it really was possible to come back and equalize, maybe even win. But sadly, it was not to be.  In the second half, we scored to reduce the deficit to 2-1, I was practically leaping with joy. But then, Green Bay scored again, a goal that most spectators thought was offside. Some Green Bay guy kicked the ball up and another GreenBay player raced up (this was the point where he was supposedly offside) and vollied it way out of my reach, into the goal. My team mates were screaming 'offside'. The referee wasn't even listening. The score was 3-1 to Green Bay, and now the dreadful realization creapt over me. There was no way of equalizing now.  However, we scored again to make it 3-2, but by now both teams were exhausted and there were no more goal scored. Green Bay were celebrating a sensational win; we were licking our wounds and hoping to bounce back.  This loss was quite a stinging blow to all of us as we have never lost before. Butall we have to blame are ourselves, because I think we got a bit big-headed after our winning spree. Hopefully we can refresh ourselves and win our next match!
