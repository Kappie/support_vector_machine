We need to make the scum that make that website do more!!!!  By sending 10 pounds a month to me, you too can make a difference, just 10 pounds a month will help me to hire a hitman in order to eliminate the maker of the site so i can take control and make it good for all you special people who deserve it.  Imagine a site which had interesting stuff on it, imagine a site which you could be proud to look at. It is possible.  So please, donate generously, and you too, can help make a difference.  Thank you  Julian
