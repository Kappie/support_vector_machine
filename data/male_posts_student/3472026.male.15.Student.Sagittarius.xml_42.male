Last month, he performed his hit “Fire  Desire” with Teena Marie at the BET Awards. He had finished an album and was preparing for its release next year. He was also in discussion with various studios for a movie based on his life.   Born in Buffalo, NY known as the King of Punk Funk, and the bad boy of Motown, Rick James blended the hard core funk of his predecessors’ James Brown, Sly Stone and George Clinton with the Rock and Roll theatrics of the Rolling Stones and Kiss. Rick James was the quintessential “Super Freak,” a term he coined in the 1980’s with the multi-platinum song he wrote, arranged, produced and performed sharing that same title. The single catapulted the album Street Songs to #1 on the R charts and #3 on the popo charts. This mega-talented, multi-Grammy and American Music Award winner played at least five different instruments and had not only sold in the millions himself, he had written and produced songs for the likes of Eddie Murphy, Mary Jane Girls, The Temptations, Teena Marie and Smokey Robinson, all selling in the millions as well. He had licensed his work for the use of sampling by artists such as  Mary J. Blige, Erykah Badu and MC Hammer, who’s sample of “Super Freak” for the hit single “U Can’t Touch This” made Please Hammer,  Don’t Hurt ‘Em the biggest selling rap album in history.
