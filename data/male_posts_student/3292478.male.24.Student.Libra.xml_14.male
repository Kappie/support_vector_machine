Held on Saturday July 17th in the Exeter ghetto.  There were some other pics but they didn't really come out very well so these are the best of the lot. If I get any others then i'll be sure to add them!  If any of the 'Stag Crew' want any copies let me know and i'll run off a batch!  Hope you all enjoy!  P.S. Apologies for the photos which are on their side, the hassle I had getting them all on here meant I was too lazy to turn them all right side up!!
