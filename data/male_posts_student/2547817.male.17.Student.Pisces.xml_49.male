Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife.  What if she was justified? What if I really was a jerk. She could be trying to absolve herself of hurt, anger, frustration. I choose again, to believe that I'm to blame. If there's one purity, I choose to believe that it's her. I'm an asshole.  Had very weird dreams last night. Dreamt that I killed Gareth with a spade like object. A sharp one. BUT HE WAS TRYING TO KILL ME FIRST! Sumpah! Then I tried junking the body in a big drain, but not before 2 women showed up at the top of the overhead bridge. One gasped and the other took a photo. What I don't get, is why Gareth? Weird.  It's 10.47. Have been mucking about all day. Just found out that I've got homework due tomorrow. A lot of it. She's always on my mind. I miss her telling me "I love you". I felt it every single time she said it. I miss her so. She hates me.  Later.
