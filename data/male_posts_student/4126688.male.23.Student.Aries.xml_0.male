When it comes to serving others, we often ask the question, “should I?” I think a better question is “can I?” If the answer to the latter is “yes,” then action  must  be taken. I think this is the general idea of Bono’s  urlLink commencement address  to the 2004 graduating class of the University of Pennsylvania entitled “Because We Can, We Must.”   urlLink What  can  you do about the situation in Africa?   urlLink What  can  you do about poverty in America?   urlLink What  can  you do about politics?  What  can  you do about anything?
