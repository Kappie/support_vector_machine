I don want to scold him. But he don want to cooperate. -.-" Haiz.. i guess its retribution... Right weiHong? lolx~ Got my results after that. Not too bad. Mr Suren said i wasn't tactful enough. Sometimes a little blunt. =P And the rest are just those good stuff teachers normally said. Then went back to Wenwei's house there to meet the rest of the officers. Had a dinner with them. And went to pasir ris.  Sunday was a flu day. Went to service late. Yong lah, don wanna wake up. --> i'm finding excuses. =P Told ms Tracey i wanted to stop my piano. Gonna miss my chio bu teacher~ sobx. Then i CLIMBED into jjc to study with weichong. But i guess i was too tired. Slept half the time. =P We've made friends with the security guard. He even offered us you tiao and rambutans. lolx~ weichong is pestering me to check out sth again.. =P oh ya, when we CLIMBED out of the school. a policeman happened to pass by. Then asked and asked alot of questions. -.-" lolx~ we went off at about 6. when i reached home, i took my dinner and slept till now. lolx~  Gonna catch some hmwk den going back to dreamland. Adios.
