I HAVEN'T PREPARED MY GIFT FOR THE MORTAL YET! You say how!!!! It's very atrocious you know! XC suggested something. I think I am gonna take his advice. Even though it is not my original idea...but hey! I am gonna make it very nice!  Today, YH finally talked to me. Like he became friendly to me and everything lor. I am so glad everything's worked out fine! HaHa! Yeah....kinda. I hope the WQ crisis would end up "happily ever after" (Hey! I learnt it in Sabrina today!).  I got my Bio Practical back. Honestly, it sucks. The only thing that saved me from failing is the theory questions at the back. I almost got full marks (saved for one). And it is ironic that Mrs Chua says the theory questions are the ones that separates the A1 material. Because the theory questions saved my skin. Looks like Jason is right, after all. What good if you are good in theory, but not good in practical? Sigh!!!!   Today, we stayed back to do homework. Actually, I am the only one doing homework. The rest is either revising or being taught. "We" refers to me, XC, CQ, Janet, MeiYing, SL and PeiYing. HaHa! I didn't complete History homework after all. Mainly because Ah Ji persuaded me to do Maths, and do History with him tomorrow dueing MT lesson. But!! He said that he will do tonight! I panicked! I don't wanna do History alone! So, what I did was I completed history just now. Yeah. Feel so guilty now! Ha!! Dunnoe what to do tomorrow la!  Hey! Wendy left me a message in her blog. And here's my reply. Oh look! I have full confidence in you! Don't worry about it, okay? I will try to teach you to the best of my ability. Ayiah....Don't worry lor. What else can I say besides "don't worry lor"? Oh yeah. Good luck to your Prelims? Okay! I stop stressing you out. And I won't get stressed out one la!  Oh yes. My neighbour, the sister of Edmund, wants me to help her print. I refused flat, even though she has to pass up tomorrow. She is always doing this me you know. And she keep saying "Ladt time"! When it is ever gonna be the last time? Why can't she ask her friends to print for her? Why must always depend on me? And she is doing this last minute lor! I hate last minute work lor! So, this actually gives you a lesson not to do last minute work, and don't always depend on your neighbour for help. They are extremely unreliable.  Okay, my eyes are getting blurry. I realize that this is a sucky entry. But oh well. I gotta go sleep now. Goodnight blog!
