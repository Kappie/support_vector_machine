She left the Kung Fu club after only a couple of weeks for two reasons: firstly she couldn't understand a word my Chinese sifu was saying, secondly her friends were doing Tae Kwon Do.  I hope that one day she will come back to Kung Fu.  But anyway, I saw this class today, and I was truly shocked.  A huge class in a small gym, performing pathetic little movements with instructors beaming at them.  All the techniques are done with no contact, and once when very light accidental contact was made (due to a lack of control) the Black Tag (one away from Black Belt) at the receiving end doubled up.  How would he fare on the street?  And he was one of the better members of the class.  But the real reason I hate Tae Kwon Do so much is that it pretends to be something that it isn't.  Take something like Tae Bo - it throws in a few martial arts, but its main aim is fitness, most like an aerobics class.  Yet reading the information that the TKD club gives out, it claims to teach people 'superbly effective sefl defense.'  For a great number of reasons, with which I won't bore you non-MAers, I could tell that this was not the case.  In a street fight, they would try to use over-complicated, ineffective techniques that would simply anger a potential attacker more angry and lead to the TKD practitioner getting hurt.  So what does this club do?  Churns out over-confident people, giving out higher belts to anyone who has been going on for long enough.  Sure, the overcrowded classes bring in the cash.  I'm sure they bring in a lot of cash, which is why TAGB is the largest Martial Arts organisation in Britain.  It offers something for all the family, under the pretence of teaching them to defend themselves, whereas in fact with the confidence boost it gives them probably only endangers them more.  There is a lot more I can bitch about, such as the discipline in the class and the ability of their master, but I'm sure it would only bore you.  Do Kung Fu everyone.
