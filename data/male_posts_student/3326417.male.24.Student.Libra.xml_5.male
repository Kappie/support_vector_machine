According to the authors in the journals that I found, the primary interest is public health and the secondary interest is financial gain. I don't believe that for one second. I think that the primary interest is financial gain and the secondary interest is public health. When beer companies fund research to test the effects of alcohol is it any wonder that the scientists come back with a response that "Drinking a beer or two a day is good for you"! Companies fund this research with the primary interest of using the information to make financial gains. Wow beer is good for you? Maybe I should start drinking more often. Since I am on vacation in California visiting my dad, I am able to hear some of his personal horror stories about his business dealings. His response to the idea of ethics, "There is no integrity".  I pose the question, is it possible to work on complete integrity? Perhaps not, but we must strive for it no matter how many times we are "screwed" in the process. After all that is said and done, those organizations with the most integrity will be those that succeed.
