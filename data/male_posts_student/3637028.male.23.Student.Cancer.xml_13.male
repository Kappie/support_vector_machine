If you remember  urlLink Jason Lee's  line in " urlLink Dogma " about air conditioning... you saw that movie.  As a guy that likes to do things after the sun goes down I was stuck twiddling my thumbs because nothing was lit, nothing was open, and I wasn't tired.  I did go out to Steak  Shake last night for a little nosh and watched a girl puke up the gum she swallowed back in 1990 when she was three.  For some reason she was in the guys bathroom.  Watching that taught me an important lesson:  too much drinking leads to lots of puking which leads to no friends.  If only I had known that earlier...  At least I can pass it on to the youth of the world so they don't commit the same mistake as I did.  Now I'm going to take a shower with a goddam light on!
