I would talk about how I think it sucks for the school to issue more parking permits than there are spaces, but whoops I already did just spill it all right there.  That does suck.  You have to get there at about 6:40 to get a decent spot.  Maybe I'll just say screw it all and move to Postville.  I don't have any friends that go to Kennedy, anyways!  Hah.
