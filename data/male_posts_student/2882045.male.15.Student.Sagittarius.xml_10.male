Now, let us begin:         Fabian had always been an outcast. You would be too if your name were Fabian. Anywho, Fabian was a young man with a special ability: in order to cope with his problems, Fabian could pause the very weaving of space and time and undo whatever stitch the fates had sewn and alter them in whatever way he wished. Useful? Yeah, it may come in handy once or twice. Thus begins Fabian's journey.     Day one:...  This story sucks...yes, it just hit me. Sorry to waste these thirty seconds of your life. Let's try this again, shall we?    There once existed a young man named Rip. Caring, Rip tried his hardest to keep everyone happy. However, this wasn't always the easiest task. The following are true excerpts from his daily life. Schwa.    Today was a fairly good day to Rip. On a scale of 1 to 10, one being the worst, ten the best, Rip's day was about a six. A little bit better than average because he is finally on normal speaking sperms with someone he cares about very much once again. As usual, his archnemesis... The evil Count Knives (that's right) was on the prowl once again. She issued a true test of Rip's will today: she forced him down on a table, restrained him with leather straps and cackled as a pendulum slowly made its way towards his crotch and Rip Jr. This process is also often referred to as a test, but hey, my story, my words, got it?!? Sadly, my Archbishop (Mrs. Beard) is departing from the school and the time has come to issue a search far and wide across the land in order to find a worthy taskmaster. Will the interviewees survive the test? Luckily, the princess smiled at Rip today, marking the first day this week that the sun has truly shined on his castle. Next week, Rip may even learn how to use the force, who the hell knows.
