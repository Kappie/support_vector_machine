Well I don't think I'm gonna write about everything that's happened in the past month so I'll just write about the important stuff. Let's see..... We had a great Christmas at Indiana. Lot's of fun, hoping I'll get to go back soon. I've been just doing pretty normal stuff. Contra dancing... sooo much fun, school sooo not fun. Having some great fellowship with Chris and Tim after church. I've decided to learn the piano. I've wanted to play something for so long and since we have a piano I figured I'd do that. I won't be as great as most people who started when they were young but I wanna be able to play something.  Right now I'm waiting for the UPS man to come with our air soft guns... heh heh *evil grins*. Man my mind is a total blank. Well tonight my family and I are going to Heather's concert performance. That'll be fun seeing everybody at least almost everybody. And hopefully I won't keep you guys waiting so long for the next entry. Till then! Up, up and awaaaaaaaay!!!
