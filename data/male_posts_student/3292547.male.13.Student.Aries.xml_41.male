The reasons were simple enough, that I doubt many people will go back that far into the history and read  everything . I think I will just at a "pictures removed by author" image in the smilies place. And for all the others just delete the link to them.   Other image have been moved to a permant sever so that even if the pages don't get a hit in so long, it won't be deleted. This will save me trouble for going back through those pages. This new one does have a bandwith limit, but, I shouldn't have a problem with that because not many people come anyway. Or at least I doubt it. Those will be stuck on that server until I decided to pay for a website domain name at which time I will run everything off of there; images and the blog. One of the many wonderful things you can do with Blogger =-); upload your blog via ftp to a domain. Wahoo!  But that's a long way coming. Well, I'll post more later. Bye
