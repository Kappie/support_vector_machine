Anyways, Im never surprised how much music can explain how a person feels at any given time.  Today is gonna be the day That they’re gonna throw it back to you By now you should’ve somehow Realised what you gotta do I don’t believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now Backbeat the word was on the street That the fire in your heart is out I’m sure you’ve heard it all before But you never really had a doubt I don’t believe that anybody feels The way I do about you now And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would Like to say to you But I don’t know how Because maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me   And after all You’re my wonderwall Today was gonna be the day?  But they’ll never throw it back to you By now you should’ve somehow Realised what you’re not to do I don’t believe that anybody Feels the way I do About you now And all the roads that lead you there were winding And all the lights that light the way are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you I don’t know how I said maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me   And after all You’re my wonderwall I said maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me   And after all You’re my wonderwall Said maybe You’re gonna be the one that saves me You’re gonna be the one that saves me You’re gonna be the one that saves me  Ok, so Oasis rocks.  Anyways, if anyone cares, Im willing to open up my blog and let others post.  Just cause I dont always have the most interesting things to say.  Just lemme know, and if Im in a good mood, I can hook you up.  Although lately, Im sinking back into the darkness, but the new motivation is still blazing within.  Metaphorlicious.  I dont know whats up with me.  I always joked about being the sane one in the family, but I think I need some Zoloft or Paxil or something to take the edge off.
