For all those who don’t know what this game is, here you go.  urlLink http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris    Rambles : No more using codenames, I can’t be bothered xD This means you, yes you, Fungus, won’t have that name anymore xD So, let’s go on with the day…   Today was great I guess, got the report cards back today… I got B’s in everything except Indo and Computer. That teacher is going to die, I bloody got an A in the last test, and I didn’t do half bad in anything before that. Half the time I listen to him, all he does is repeat himself, the other half of the time, he’s reading aloud what I’ve already read in the text. When you ask him a question, he uses the “Oh, I don’t know the answer to that, look in the text…” Fucking cunt bucket turd monkey wench.   Then went to Town Square to meet Murti, who came late! Late, late, late! But it gave me time to exercise, I haven’t done much of that for two weeks xD Weird thing is, as I was walking, this strange, queer looking couple (a man and a woman, just weird looking) said “Hi” to me. The first thing I thought of was “Shit! These are those people that like spicing up with their sex life with a third member, ah ah ah”. And I walked off as fast as I could.  Mur finally came, and after buying the tickets, we went on our merry way to Starbucks. There are way too many Starbucks’ in the world today. Regardless, after some palaver, went off to get my cappuccino blast (because that’s what Dammo’s do). Then the movie. Troy, ah Troy. The movie of some distaste in my mind lately has held true to my expectations, and that will be in my topic today. Some kids in the movie theatre kept chattering aimlessly. Now, if I was less lazy, I would have gone down there, searched for the kid, and socked him in the eye. No, probably the groin, because their voices sound so much funnier after a successful hit to the groin has been incurred.  After the movie was over, we hung around with some other people for ten minutes or so. I can’t stand smoke, I felt like socking two people after the movie was over. Maybe the movie made me more violent. Nah, movies don’t do that xD Made fun of Arty some, and jested at Jana, oh life is beautiful.   Then Mur and I had supper, more palaver (though the eating made this less so). Then, off to Christina’s house to pick up her shoes. Then, after dilly dallying there for a few minutes, we went back and left in my car so we could drop ‘Princess’ Mur off xP   And now I’m home, whoopity doo xD   And on another note, Kristine smsed, good stuff. HELLO IF YOU’RE READING.    Topic : Troy the Movie vs Troy of History   I’m lazy, so I’ll bullet point everything so that you people will be able to easily compare the two x)   First off, Troy of History. There is no conclusive evidence of Troy existing, so this is off stuff in the books  The Iliad  and  The Odyssey . Anyway   - Achilles’ mother knew he was going to die, so she hid him in the court of King Lycomedes. Where’s the puncher? He was dressed as a woman.   - Achilles’ is said to have died by Paris’ arrow (knife in some versions) during a truce between the Greeks and the Trojans.   - The Battle of Troy lasted ten years.   - Paris is said to have kidnapped Helen (though some say she came willingly, the little slut).   - The first time the Greeks set out for Troy, they couldn’t find it, so they returned home.   - Ajax falls to madness, kills some cattle, and then kills himself, after Hector falls.    - Patroclos was Achilles’ friend.   - Paris is received in the house of Menelaus alone, without his brother Hector, as part of a deal with the Goddess Aphrodite.   - Both Agamemnon and Menelaus did not die.       Now for Troy the Movie.   -	Achilles’ mother knew he was going to die but she encouraged him by saying that he would live forever in story, as opposed to only living for a while in the tales of his children’s children.  -	Achilles’ lives until the Trojan Horse trick is implemented, and then dies by Paris’ arrow. He gets hit by a number of arrows to the chest after the heel shot (oh, that scene reminded me of that scene in LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring)  -	The Battle of Troy lasts what seems to be in the movie a couple of days. Extremely disappointing, despite the fact that The Iliad starts in the tenth year of the battle.   -	Paris romanced Helen back to Troy. Naturally, because Elves are so damn pretty.   -	The Greeks seem to find Troy in one shot.   -	Ajax is killed by Hector.   -	Patroclos was Achilles’ cousin.   -	Paris and Hector come to the house of Menelaus on behalf of peace between Sparta and Troy.   -	Agamemnon and Menelaus die!    Yes, I took time to compare the two, just to prove I don’t criticise without reason.
