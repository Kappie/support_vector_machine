Lonely, yet in the company of some of the best female companions I have ever had.. it is often a good feeling and a sigh of relief to know that there are some people I can turn to, and I have turned to them.. but other times I feel incomplete. What to do... what to do.  Maybe I need to search a little bit harder for what I am looking for.. I probably need to take the advice I just gave to a good friend..  "Take chances, make mistakes, it is the only way things can happen"  I'm going to take some chances... hopefully they will be the right ones, but there is only one way to find out, eh?
