Anyway... today I plan on going to campus around 12:35 to do the following:  Get reading done for the 2 art history courses, and FINISH a paper.  Tomorrow I plan on going to the grocery store and picking up:   Green bell pepper Black pepper Salad dressing Chicken breasts Orange Juice   Then going to campus to pick up a book at the bookstore and sitting in on a class.  **
