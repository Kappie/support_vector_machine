He walks up to one of the rooms and sees the patient sitting on his bed making the noise of an engine.The doctor walks in and asks "Bill, what are you doing?" Bill looks up and replies "I'm a truck driver. I'm taking my wagon to France to get some cheap booze"   Slightly lost for words, the doctor leaves the room. As he walks up to the next room, all he can is hear is someone moaning and groaning. He looks in the next room and sees the patient lying on his bed, completely starkers, making love to his pillow! The doctor bursts in and shouts "Bob, what the hell are you doing?" Bob looks round and says   "I'm shagging Bill's wife while he's in France"
