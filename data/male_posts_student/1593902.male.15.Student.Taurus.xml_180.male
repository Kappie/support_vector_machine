That'll settle it for both sides.  shadowlight2002: lmao KillerHurricanes: more of me: "  Talking of Jesus (earlier) he only used to hang out with men. He loved his mother, who according to him was a virgin.  Oh and he never married.    All sounds a little gay to me.  " shadowlight2002: lmao KillerHurricanes: Franco Caliz: Man Of Genius
