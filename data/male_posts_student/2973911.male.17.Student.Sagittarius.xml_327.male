I know you like me Jed, don't hide it." -----------------Ermmm, pwede ba friends lang muna tayo?    :P   You know what, Lemme' share you an experience that I had while I was in high school. For those who hate mushiness, I advice you to cease reading unless you like puking. Anyways,  I had the same predicament as Jeremiah about relationships before. I was the same teenager with the same "good" hormones as I am now, hehehe. I dunno if I was cautious or sumthin' but I just refused entertaining thoughts on relationships even if it is in the basket already.   I can't say that I was a homo (I'm not implying anything) because I had once a deep admiration for this girl who was fortunately my classmate. At that time, I didn't knew if she liked me or not. Then a cool morning on Valentines Day 99' arrived. It was in school in the middle of a class break, there I was sitting in a bench alone (what in tarnation was I doing there?), I took a glance near the school shop near the entrance when  I swear I see that girl getting prettier by the moment (at least that was 5 yrs. ago). She was buying sumthin' from the school shop. Then the bell rang, signalling the time to go back to class. Knowing that it was Valentine's Day, our class adviser, Ms. Torres arranged a "special" program in which a certain person will give sumthin' to another person he/she likes. For the program,  I managed to buy some scrappy flowers from outside d skul to give to my "girl" friends whom I had the same benefaction of receiving valentine appurtenances as well. Anyway, just as the class was already over, when there "she" came from out of the blue and greeted me a Happy Valentine's day, instantaneously giving me a heart shaped crimson red balloon. What that it made me feel something that I have never ever felt before. I can feel her sweet, caring aura enveloping around my unsteady body, with no malice intended. Now I can confirm that she really likes me after all. It's not love. It is almost there, but not yet. Anyways, I in turn thanked her very much for the trouble... Sheepishly she asked me if I was going home, and since I know how gentleman I am (at that time only lolz), I offered to go with her coz I was going in the same route as well ------ The events unfolding was an excellent concoction for a good relationship about to happen...  When all of that, I just gave up all. After that fateful day, I still did not talk to her. I tried not to look in her eyes. She knew that I was setting us apart. I didn't think that I was that picky. I was just afraid of being rejected in the long run. I was afraid of being hurt. I was afraid of the unknown future. I was cautious. In the end, I was afraid of something that never really happened, in which I didn't even try. Looking back, laughing at myself of the "things" that I had done, made me wanna' do the right choices if given a chance, and it's not just about love life for that matter, but for the most part of my life and what's remaining of it.  What I therefore think  conclude about us folks being cautious about relationships (for whatever reasons), though natural initially, should not interfere the course of any part of our life, especially our social  love life...... Oh,  pardon my blabbing. It's just my way of releasing tension from work  studies.  Ahhhhhh, now I can sleep well, dami kong nasulat... Tomorrow will be grandma's 79th b-day (and her last one as she says to me). Gotta sleep early for her. Eniweys, Catchall'l8er!     *yawn
