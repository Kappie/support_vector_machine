Ofcourse you can't be emotionally perfect. Otherwise you wouldn't be watching us, tv-marketeers. But we can make your body perfect. The only thing you'd have to do for it is give us all your money, follow many diets and spend your day doing sit-ups, push-ups, all with our material. If you don't you won't have a perfect body and then you're a pathetic creature. As a matter of fact you should do plastic surgery as well. Everybody should transform him/herself into a Britney look-a-like or a Johnny Depp look-a-like. So we all will have a perfect body.  This subject has been slagged off millions of times before. Maddox wrote a decent piece about tv-marketeers if I remember right and on www.illwillpress.com you can find a terribly funny piece about considering your weight and stuff like that. I won't and can't really add something to the things stated on this subject already. "Then why do you write this?" Because I wanted to, because I'm fucking annoyed by those people at the moment. That's why. "Geez, Willem, this post sucked" Go to hell, don't read my site if you don't like it, tell your friends not to read my site, I don't care, just DO NOT EVER TELL WHAT I SHOULDN'T POST. You can Suggest me what I Should write but don't Tell me what Not to write. People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time.
