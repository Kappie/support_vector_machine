At least until, it's been relatively speculative of how Clinton is campaigning for Bush so Hilary can run in '08... on that note, here's another incident supporting that theory.   urlLink Clinton Says Cultural Liberalism Loses Elections   And I quote...    Bill Clinton warned Senator John Kerry, presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, to counter Republican efforts to turn this year's election into a debate on gay marriage and other "cultural issues" such as gun control and abortion.   In an interview with the Financial Times, the former US president urged Senator Kerry to fight a values-based campaign focused on health, education and crime.   If he stayed on that ground, Mr. Kerry could win by "quite a nice margin".      Sheesh, ol' Slick Willy is making his secret I'm-Supporting-Bush agenda rather obvious, no? Obviously, even Clinton knows that it is on cultural issues such as abortion, gun control, and gay marriage where Democrats lose most of their support (which is probably why the Republicans have both the House and Senate under their control). Kerry would be good to heed Billy's advice, at this point...  What's next? Clinton wearing a Bush/Cheney '04 shirt? If only...
