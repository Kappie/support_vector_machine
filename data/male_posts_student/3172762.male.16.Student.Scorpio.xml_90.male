	 
      your voice like a siren's beautiful notes forces me to listen and admire your angelic tones  lighter than a cloud and deeper than the sea your voice vibrates in tones that sound almost to be the wind  it is intoxicating and drunkens me in your greatness what is said does not matter for whatever it is is true i am yours to command, i will obey just to hear another breath now speak and let me escape to the intonated world of your bliss speak again my love
