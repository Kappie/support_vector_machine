Nathan-I totally recognized Timon's voice on the CD...I just didn't know that Nathan Lane was him!!!  I thought it was Billy Crystal...doesn't he sound like that?!  But, yeah, I recognized his voice and also Matthew Broderick's voice from when I saw The Music Man.  That's a good musical, as well. Jonah-Congrats on State!  And even though Marching Band IS a death cult, I'm still proud of you guys' beating Carmel.  That's quite a feat!  YAY! Nathan (again)- Sqee or whatever is a comic-thing...I've seen it once, so you're not that far behind.    And I have to agree with Lara, it's spelled with a "u".  SQUEE!
