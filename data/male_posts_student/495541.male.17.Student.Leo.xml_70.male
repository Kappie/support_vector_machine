Some people, like me, do anything just to get the work over with.  I'm trying to do the assignments 100% but, in the process, actually learning the information is hard.  That would take much more time, really.  I suppose if you really want to get good grades, you have to do that.  I'm pretty sure I lack the excitement to learn something.  Reading from text books is not very exciting when you can easily fall asleep if you put your hand on your chin.  I can't seem to stay awake while reading from textbooks in class.  I think I need more caffeine.  I know the school has vending machines all over the place to suck our money right out of our pockets, but I don't care much about something that tastes good.  I think more about quenching my thirst.  Drinking Gatorade and water all the time really changes your awareness of thirst.  Some say drinking soda makes you thirstier.  I say it just gives you massive amounts of plaque build up and a sugary dryness in your mouth... yuck.  Water please.  If you looked at my desk right now, you'd immediately call me a hypocrite, because I've got an empty can of Pepsi sitting to my left.  I suppose it's different though.  I could easily get a glass of water if I wanted, while in school, I've got to make the decision of getting the soda or water (or drinking fountain) before class.  Wow.  I think I talk nonsense extremely well.  Nonetheless, that's all I can seem to focus on right now.  I have nothing left to say.  Good night.
