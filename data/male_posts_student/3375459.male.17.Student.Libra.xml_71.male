It wasn’t such a bad game, and it only took me not more then a full week to complete all of its missions.  I still feel kinda bad having to let my sim wet his pants every now and then. HEhehe~ It has been raining in the early mornings, and there’s nothing better to do then to snugger under the comfort of my own blanket.  I didn’t get any good rest last night. Remember the rains that has been falling, well it kind of brought along a fleet of mosquitoes. And I was like stung from head to toe, itching to death. Even after I wrapped myself in my blanket, they will just keep coming buzzing next to my ears, how annoying. I got so irritate scratching, that I woke up to get a glass of water (3am this morning). I went like ‘Wow~’ the moon’s so bright, it even lit up my kitchen. I guess I was so tired, the itch didn’t matter anymore and I ..zzZZ all the way.   With the room lit up by the warm morning rays, I saw the horrors those fleet did to me. Let’s sum up the damage they did, 2 bites on my left upper arm, 3 on my left thigh and 1 on my right thigh. And look at all the red scratch marks they made me leave behind. ARGhhh….   Finally, my fringe’s touching the tip of my nose. I admit it’s a pretty dumb thing to be all excited about, but it took me a full 2+months to keep my hair this long. Now that my target has been acquired, I think it’s time I go for a trim, well maybe tomorrow. Heheheh~. Alright, its lunch time. Chao~
