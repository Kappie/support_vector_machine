But now, the supreme court, composed of 5 idiots and four reasonably sane people, has  urlLink upheld  a Nevada law that tramples the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Although it seems that this might be applicable to being stopped for carrying a briefcase onto the train, the court still requires reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is about to be committed in order to trample our constitutional rights.   So unless I'm about to commit a crime, the coppers better keep their hands off.  Everyone knows where I keep the bail money, right?  Amendment IV  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.   As I was walkin'  -  I saw a sign there And that sign said - no tress passin' But on the other side  .... it didn't say nothin! Now that side was made for you and me!  This land is your land, this land is my land From California, to the New York Island From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters This land was made for you and me  In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple Near the relief office - I see my people And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin' If this land's still made for you and me.
