Freaking giant, almost same size as a cd..           And i tot my hands are big    Ok, from the pic above, u might tink its not tat big, but its damn freaking big.. And best still, after buying, keep it in the fridge for a few days, and it will become soft and moist.. And i will be feeling high on pears.. WOO.. Favourite fruit from china fuji apple to this pear.. Come on mum, buy more!!!  Current Mood: High Current Music: Huang Pin Yuan - Xiao Wei
