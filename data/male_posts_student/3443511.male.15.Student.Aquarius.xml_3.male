Lol, and this blog is exactly what you need.           Yeah, alright, so i wake up late again (i never wake up early), rush rush this, and rush rush that....At school, i was walking down the hall, and i got more "interesting" stares than normal.  I usually get the "what the hell is wrong with that kid" kind of stares.  But, today i got the "How could that kid have emotions like compassion" kind of stares.  It was actually pretty funny on my part.  I thought, hmmmm....i wonder if she figured it out and told people, who told people, who told people, etc.             I went to talk to my friends, and the funniest thing i have seen in a long time walked around the corner.  It was one of my friends...and he was wearing a trench coat with harley davidson cut-off finger hole gloves.  It was hilarious, if you ever knew this kid, you would probably have fell off your seet when you saw this.  This kid is like a rapper (but not black) and he is not "harley-like" at all.  And when he came walking in in all black and that trenchoat on, everyone who saw him just laughed their asses off.  It was so fricken hilarious.        The day dragged on and on and on...Finally, i was in my computer class (Information Processing III or Advanced Word), i sent a little message to a person i knew was her friend.  Oh, it wasn't an e-mail..  You know when you get those little security boxes that say something like printer not connected, couldn't connect to site, some wierd text boxes that appear on the middle of your screen.  I sent her one of those.  I think i scared her.  It said sent from chs11587 (or something like that) to: (the persons name)..lol, it was pretty funny.  I just really wanted to test it out.  Anyways, i told her to send me an e-mail back if she knew if her friend knew who wrote the note.  Well, she never replied back...then, our system crashed, and it was all chaos.  Crappy school computers.  Oh, and i'm smarter than our computer technicians at school (on computers) so i have some fun...lol.         Anyways, i thought, oh shit, what if she didn't know about the note and was going to ask her about it.  I just gave myself away....SHIT!!!!  Well, i thought, i screwed myself, but, she never talked to me, sent me an e-mail, or anything....I was kind of confused...  But, as i always am.. you know.  Nothing much exciting happened from then on, i just went home, worked out, after a while went on the computer, and decided to make a blog for all the people to laugh at me...        ~Your life is ending one minute at a time, if you were to die tomorrow, what would you do today?~
