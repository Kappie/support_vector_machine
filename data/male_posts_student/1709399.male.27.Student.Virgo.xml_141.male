We had undertaken an old clothes Drive , through which we collected close to 400 Clothes from all our employees . I had gone today to distribute those clothes to a Slum near DND Flyover  Ramakrishna Mission . At the DND Flyover we distributed close to 100 Sweaters to the kids most of whom were bare-bodied with hardly any clothes on them .  It was a very satisfying  productive day and I was glad that I could help in a small way in making a difference to these people's lives.
