If you did, then you don't know me very well):  I got an e-mail at work that read as follows:    Per D: Her and R have switched lunch times today.    After reading the e-mail I said aloud "[so  so] needs to learn to use good grammar. Bad grammar irritates me!" Then a co-worker (who is always irritated at me for one reason or another) turned around to say (unintentionally using bad grammar): "Not nobody doesn't use good grammar like Nathaniel Goold!"  That cracked me up. Though that was funny, bad grammar is nothing to laugh at. Seriously.
