The design argument is basically that the whole entire universe is so complex and there has to be an intelligent being to create it. That's basically the strongest theist argument for God, and its still pretty hard for Atheists ro refute that. I'll come to the evil argument used by atheists later, and also, us theist have not really formulated a conclusive and satisfactory counter-argument.        Alright, what about the state of religion and science today? It is obvious the rift between these 2 camps is definitely increasing. And this basically comes to my belief in Yin and Yang. And before some chrsitians point the finger at me, telling me how I'm going to burn in hell for believing in such heathen principles. All i can say is that I believe in eclecticism where schools and systems of thought is concerned. I mean, we can all forget all about democracy if the first European settlers to America had not embraced a system of democracy, thought of by the Greeks, who believed that their Gods made mischeif with mortal's lives, had sexual orgies and a bunch of illegetimate kids.                But, those bunch of settlers, despite building America with Christian principles and ethics in mind, did embrace a school of thought by a bunch of people with a totally different religious background. What was I trying to say? (i'll come on to my belief on Yin and Yang later.........) I was trying to say that,  don't reject principles which you are not familiar with or if of a different school of thought. Never hesitate to pick up principles you find applicable and practical to your life, be it buddhist, sikh, gnostic, communist, capitalist, socialist, federalist, nihilist, darwinist or whatever.               The religious nowadays are basically the most touchy people in modern society. Just a whiff of the winds of change, the whiff of feminism, darwinism and the like sends them running for shelter. And they start pining for the good old days where traditional principles prevailed. In short, modern society offends them. True, they can be the funkiest, most contemporary people around, but i'm not adressing fashion around here, i'm addressing the issue of conflicting principles.               Science is disgusting to the religious............i mean, sure, as long as science do not step across the boundaries of religion, they're fine with that. Take for example, when Joshua "stopped" the day when he fought a war. What makes you think that God did that with a snap of his fingers, but not, God making a meteor out of a ball of dust from a galaxy 5 million light years from the milky way, starts flicking it, and soon it hurtles to our galaxy, to our solar system, and it hits the moon of the Earth which causes a change of the gravitional pull on the Earth and the Earth stops rotating?               That's when science starts to intrude in the boundaries of religion, and the religious starts to get offended. Why? their oh-so-precious notion of God snapping his fingers get destroyed into something which can be put into a scientific thesis. Its like Galileo Galilee, when he intruded into the church's notion of the Earth being in the center of the universe, he got imprisoned and persecuted for his beliefs. Of course, we know Galilee was right. But are we like the church back in Galileo's time? Are we resistant to new, well-founded concepts and schools of thoughts which come our way? And our only consequence is to be proven wrong many decades later.....................               Btw, i'm not referring to science exclusively, in this analogy, this includes new sociological, political, economic and philosophical ideas. Of course, i'm not saying that we follow wherever the crowd follows. But, what i was saying is that do not dismiss anything out of your religious pride. Always question new and alternative schools of thoughts starting from a neutral stance, and seriously, if God does not want us to believe in science and us still believing in him snapping his fingers all the time, he would not give us something called a brain...........duh......that's pretty obvious..........lol               Then regarding the scientific community. I never believe in personal belief intruding into the scientific process. Scientists are mainly involved in the study of science and not arts, there should never be philosohical or sociological hints in any of their theories and works. Darwin was obviously playing Black metal music when he wrote his theory of evolution. Actually his original title for his theory was "I hate God and here's why" but his secetary decided to change it anyway.                ome Scientists, in their haughty and arrogant nature, make their primary job disproving religious concepts and beliefs. While some religious beliefs are opressive and certain scientists have certainly contributed to society by disproving them, there are many who disprove religion to feed their ego instead of doing it out of altruism.                My advice to both sides is to seek to work with each other. Just like my watch analogy, there is no superior way to find out the secrets of the watchmaker and the watch. Why don't the scientist and priest shake hands, and both can share their knowledge both their findings using their different methods to get the same, common goal in half the time.   (sorry, i'll come to yin and yang and the argument of evil some other time lol..........)
