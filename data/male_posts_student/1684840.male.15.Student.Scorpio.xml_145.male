Maths was skipped for a test I had to catch up with, followed by IT where loads of people went on Zak's Amazing Incredible Swearing Keyboard, and made Mrs. Evans aware of it, who no doubt went and told Mr. Swaries landing me in a bit of bother :S.  Mr. Swaries being the great ICT head he is, thought an SWF file extension was some sort of program that could allow people to access naughty websites... right!  I gave him the URL of Zak's Swearing keyboard to block (after offering to remove it from my website but he seemed to be deaf to the MY WEBSITE part lol, but he turned that down anyway!  I was only being co-operative...) and was then told he had heard that I was able to make it onto the admin area of the school network! Wherever he heard that from I haven't a clue.  I set the rumour right and was on my way (after a little word of warning about the police lol).  I know the laws and yes I'm not stupid to go hacking the school system, what's the point anyway?  Shardae was struggling in Chemistry when Mrs. Bond drew a few lines on the board!  Lmao, that was quite funny!  Bit pissed off at Becky.  She was supposed to be organising a leaving party and it turns out there's no plans or anything.  Then to make it worse she goes and says "Well I'm not going to any party where there isn't booze!" which really puts icing on the cake.  So stuff her, our new party organiser is Chris :o)  My MP3 player came this mornin, woohoo!  It's brilliant, built in FM Radio (I love that feature, I can listen to loads of random tunes!).  I was going to ask Mr. Swaries if I was allowed to use it as a storage device to use at school on the XP computers but I thought I'd better not because of the earlier incident.  Will try and risk it tomorrow hehe.  Jamie and Craig have gone to the Peak District trip with the Geog Dept. (YESSSS!! lol)  A James-less few days :P  Gonna go now, cya...
