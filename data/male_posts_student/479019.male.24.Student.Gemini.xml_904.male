We ended up having Jamaican and  urlLink Czech beer  while we watched wrestling and  urlLink Adult Swim  with Heather. It was some good hanging out, despite the odd tasting beer.  I was thinking last night... the most flattering thing I’ve heard in recent times is how Cissa said something along the lines of wanting to be best of friends with whatever girl I end up dating. This is coming from someone who wanted me date her sister a year ago. As much drama as that suggestion caused last summer, and she has expressed her regret about causing a big stir… I still feel extremely honored that she made such a suggestion (despite the somewhat bad outcome), and continues to make suggestions about the significance of my life in relation to hers.   I didn't run this morning, I think I'll do an afternoon run today.  I need to get reading done today.  ***
