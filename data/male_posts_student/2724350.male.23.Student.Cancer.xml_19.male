However, the journey was quite scenic if you take away the road and the vehicles moving along it. I especially enjoyed the sounds of the birds and insects while I was cycling along the edge of the "forest". Like the road of life, there were several ups and downs. I was particulary relieved when after every upslope, there would be a downslope. However, I knew that there would soon be another torturous upslope after that and my relief would be short-lived.   I used the time while I was cycling to ponder upon what I had done during the week or since school started. It seemed that I was immersing myself in a seemingly "busy" state. What do I mean by that? It occured to me that I was doing all the unimportant things and worst, trying to make them sound important. During the scenic journey, I recalled that I wasn't really happy since school started, even though the freshies had came in(which meant that there would be more girls to look at...just kidding). I was wasting alot of my time in irrelevant tasks! I could had used the time to do more constructive things like spending more quality time with friends or reading my favourite book.   Most importantly, I believed the cycling trip made me realise that  LIFE  is not only about achieving. It is about sharing your happiness(or sadness for all that matters) with your loved ones and being content with what you have. I had to get my priorities right. After the trip, I felt unusually refreshed(maybe it was the effects of exercise?) I shall end this message with a chapter from   Tao De Jing   written by  Lao Tze.    P.S. For those interested to know how long it took me...The whole trip took me around 35 minutes.      Contentment       Health or reputation: which is held dearer?  Health or possessions: which has more worth?  Profit or loss: which is more troublesome?  Great love incurs great expense,  And great riches incur great fear,  But contentment comes at no cost;  Who knows when to stop  Does not continue into danger,  And so may long endure.
