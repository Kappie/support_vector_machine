Ireally hoped that This year can end sooner, so that my worries by gone faster. However, deep in my, my feelings contridicts what I had just said, for I will miss my dearest friends, especially the ones whom I miss most.    I will not meet them in the future, will I? Next year, I will be in a new environment, making new friends (I hope). What am I thinking about? I wish I would be able to meet my friends in the future and now, I should consider on studying hard.    Best wishes to everybody for the coming prelim, especially for my dearest friend!
