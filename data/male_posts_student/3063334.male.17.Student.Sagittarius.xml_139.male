Everything is going well so far,and it's an awesome place here, although I'm feeling the PRESSURE of this immense Intel ISEF competition more and more.  I had a wonderful chance already to meet people from all around the country and the world, and I have collected emblems from most states of the US and over a dozen other countries via the student pin exchange program.  I'm still assuming we are doing the book group. And Mrs.VA, I've decided to read "Catcher in the Rye". So I just need to know my book group and our agendas and plans for the week, such as what's the project all about; book notes; other works and preparations? Keep posting on the blog and keep me informed through the week.  See ya all next week.
