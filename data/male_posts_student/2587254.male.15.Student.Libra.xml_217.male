Wonderland was already pretty cool when I brought Gavin and Dave and 'em up every year, but this year having the whole HYPE group out there was really cool haha.  So I'll start off my blog about today starting really early, to be exact, last night.  Even though I did say I was going to sleep early....eventually that never happened. Well I tried, everyone did, but in the end neither me nor Gavin could really get to sleep until 2am. I got hungry around 12am, so went downstairs to have some milk and raisin bread. I realize I'm probably the only person that likes that combo of food, but guess what it is good so bite me if you think it's gross. After eating, the house then felt really humid for some reason, and then eventually I didn't use any blankets and slept on top of all of them. Then I decided to open the window a bit, and then it got cold, so I resorted to using two of the three blankets. Eeeventually I would get so sleep, only from the fact though that I was too bored to do anything else. I was thinking about watching TV downstairs but was afraid I'd wake up Gavin, so yeah scrapped that idea and tossed and turned until around 2am. THEN I finally got some shut eye......  Until 6am.  Then I couldn't sleep again. I woke up, originally hoping to get in an extra 30 minutes of shut eye, but in the end thought "screw it" and then just went to get ready for the day. After showering and everything, Gavin was then awake, and we started putting the mats back into my car after me cleaning the things yesterday. They were still a bit damp, so we tried to stomp them dry as well as we could *I'm not about to use a vacuum at 6am in the morning and wake up the neighbourhood* and then shoved them in the car. Then came putting one of the seats back in. Eventually I did it myself with a bit of help from Gavin, after I finally remembered what I did yesterday. So technically Gavin and I were underway and ready to go by 6:55am or so, but NOOOOOOOOOOO.......  My parents took FOREVER to get ready. So while me and Gavin waited, we played some NFL Street haha, where I FINALLY beat him,er would have. I had a gamebreaker coming up and I needed one more touchdown and I had possession, so I would have won =). Eventually we didn't leave my house until 725am or so, rushing to Carmen's place so they wouldn't complain much longer. So got Carmen, she was wondering why we were so late, and then Jason, who was REALLY wondering why we were so late. Oh yeah and also we filled the car up with gas and stuff also, and by a healthy 8am, we were FINALLY out on the 401.  Hmm for the first little while me and Gavin ate, then listened to some of my music, and then we tried sleeping. Eventually I did manage to fall asleep, but then Gavin woke me up when he tried to steal my cellphone. SSSSSEEEEERIOUSLY try to not wake me up if you're going to steal it. So after being awoken from a 25 minute nap, we then all began to talk since none of us could really get some shut eye in the car. I don't know how many convo subjects we had in the car, but too many to count. From sports to music to cooking, yup it was all there haha. Lame jokes of course were in there also, and also Gavin's all so famous quote:   "Flex....no flex....flex....no flex...."   Now at the same time he was doing something that was really disturbing, and probably scarred Jason, Carmen, and my mind for much of the trip.  During the time in the car though, when I was feelin' somewhat not so good, I did some thinking. Great time killing I know. But I was thinking about just how in the world I can tolerate listening to trance music and stuff like that. I think I came to a conclusion:  There are no lyrics.  Well much of it anyways, and if there are lyrics, MOST of the time it's about POSITIVE things and not about suicide, death, gunshot wounds, or how their life sucked before they made crappy songs about their sucky lives. I'm not referring to any other kind of music here *coughrapandhip-hopcough* but seriously some of that junk out there these days is retarded. I mean speaking out about depression is not usually something public until now, but WAS what you talk to psychology counselors about. I think that's why I like trance music and stuff like that, because it's so...well.....tranquil I guess you can say. Kind of funny how at one point I made fun of Tommy's techno and stuff *which I listen to now* because it had no lyrics. Would have never  thought now I like it because of that reason hehe.  So after the 2 hour long car ride out to Wonderland, we were FINALLY there. So first person I see there is Dave, then Rebecky, and then the rest of the people at the main gate. We were all waiting for Ken then, as he was running a wee bit late. So we all just kind of stood there, many of us needing to go to the jawn, but we did wait until Ken came, then most of the guys ran to the jawn, and pretty much all the girls ran to the jawn. Then we jammed all our stuff into lockers, and began our walk to the first ride of the day...Tomb Raider.  The lineup was almost an hour and a half, and the ride is pretty crappy. A few of us went to ride Sledge Hammer while we waited, and the others just lined up and chatted. Other than the fact we are riding lying down, the ride goes damn slow, and it is pretty lame. But yeah we all went on it as a group, and it is the new feature attraction so meh why not just to say I went on the sad thing. Afterwards, we all then split, with Josh, Calvin, Jason, Gavin, Dave and I going to one group and the others into the other (Carmen, Jeffany, Andy, Rebecky, Ken, and Wenders).  So this is where I basically talk about the group I was in, since I don't know where the others were.  So first ride we decided to go on was Minebuster. Fun as usual, bit bumpy, but meh that's the beauty of the old rickety thing =). Josh overcame his fear of these things which is awesome, and it was Jason's first time on a Wonderland roller coaster that actually wasn't panzy. So we all had fun for that being our first ride, and quickly shifted gears to Vortex.  Lines weren't that bad right now, so we got through Vortex in about 30-40 minutes. This one was obviously a bit more intense as you all know, but also more fun =). Jason and Josh said they were still fine, and that was when we all then introduced them to the best roller coaster there...  The beautiful steel structure standing there known as Top Gun.  Ahh yes one of my favourites. Just the fact it's the fastest and most crazy one in the park is probably enough said. Anyways Jason didn't really say much until he actually saw the drop and went down it going "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH SHIT!" Josh I think I heard him scream from when I was on the ground, as me and Dave rode the car before the others. But the fun came with a hefty price. almost TWO hours of waiting PLUS downtime for the STUPID THING BECAUSE IT WAS BROKEN. But it's all worth it just to go back on Top Gun again. Plus it was cool watching Jason and Josh going on it for the first time. So afterwards, we then had to head to lunch, as we all agreed to meet at 3pm at that gigantic globe thingy.  I can't type well right now as for some reason NOW I feel dizzy.  But anyways back on track...  With us being early and on time, and the others being 15 minutes late, we FINALLY got to eat at 330. I was starving, so was Calvin, as the two of us basically went on Top Gun with an empty stomach which got me light-headed haha. So me and Dave split on a sub, Gavin had his own sub, and some of the other guys pitched in for a pizza. Wonderland food........as usual was really expensive but oh well what can you do. Oh yeah and today, I saw one of the coolest things yet in one of the funniest ways while waiting for the other people for lunch.  ...While Jason was on the phone looking for the others, I was kind of just sitting there looking around, then I see this black kid with a Houston jersey that at first I thought was a jersey dress since it went down past his shins and I was thinking "the hell doesn't he know that's a dre......HOLY SHIT IT'S AN AUTHENTIC." After FINALLY realizing the kid just bought a really long jersey that was too long for his own good, I finally poked Jason to look at the jersey, and both of us just thought "whoa......an authentic Yao jersey...." *drool.* But it was kind of funny how at first I thought it was a jersey dress because that kid was 4'11 and his jersey was almost his height. JERSEY'S AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THAT LONG.  Anyways after lunch, we continued our ways to other rides. The groups were basically the same, but we all decided to go to the arcade. A lot of us went to play Time Crisis 3, while me and Calvin basically stuck on DDR. Of course like usual there were those really crazy dudes, then us, with me being the better end DDRer out of all of us. So I had my share of the fun playing heavy, and I think Calvin and Josh also had a fun time playing standard/heavy. Jason, Ken, and Gavin owned on TC3, and the girls they kind of ditched us and went somewhere haha.  Afterwards though we went out and decided to go on a ride. So, after much choosing.....  And deciding....  And voting......  And thinking....  ........  ........ ........  ........  We decided to watch the dive show HAHAHA. That was probably the dumbest thing I know but meh....concluded drop zone line was too long for what you get, and we got bored and decided to sit and watch something. Some of the dives were cool though, but wow was the plot horrible.  After bearing through that though, thank goodness it was only 30 minutes long, Carmen, Jason, Dave, Gavin, Josh, Calvin, Jeffany and Ken then decided to go on Dragon fire. I always liked this one a bit because of double loop so why not =).  Yup and that was the ride. Short line, decent ride. It was fun though still, and hearing Josh's imitation screams is always hilarious.  After that, then a few of us went on a final run on Skyrider. That was horrid as we would have been on time for dinner, but NOOOOOOO stupid delays making Josh, Dave and Jeffany, and I late for dinner...  ...we made it though finally though, and quickly rushed to the globe once again. It was already 725, so Josh, Dave and I quickly ran to grab a funnel cake and munched on it on the way back.  Afterwards, the eating and everything, we then kind of hung out at the drop-off zone for a bit *aren't we cool, hey some other people were picnicing in their trunks at the drop-off zone* while we waited for Calvin's and Josh  Rebecky's parents. After everyone was finally there, it was time to go home =(. After a day of fun.....  COMES A RETARDED/STUPID/FUNNY RIDE BACK HOME.  Actually no not really hahaha =). Well there were jokes and stuff of course, but lots of the time in my car was recalling what happened today with all of us. Well Jason, Gavin, and I had similar stories since we stuck together with the others, but it was nice hearing Carmen's stories from her time with Wenders and them. Actually I wished I had spent more time with them. Then again, Dave was really only aquianted with the guys. I mean, he kind of knows Carmen but kind of from LOOONG time ago, and Jeffany and Andy technically know them but not well either. So yeah had to stick with Dave and the guys for most of the day. But yeah it was nice to know Carmen got to get to know Jeffany and Andy better =).  After telling one another about our days, we spent some time cloud watching for some reason. Carmen....er....Gavin.....one of the two....maybe Jason? ANYWAYS point is THEY *HAH problem solved* pointed out that this cloud looked like a helicopter.....  ....and then I butchered it with details with me being the geeky one haha....  I thought it looked more like a plane....er afterwards with some shifting the Houston old logo because I claimed that the rotor was too far back haha. Then another cloud looked like a tank, and I thought another one looked like a volcano, which got the other ones going....   HUH!?!?!??!   But anyways that's another point. I just happen to be the ARTISTIC ONE....  *this is when Gavin coughs and Jason shifts his glasses hahaha*  .....so after the cloud watching we were all going to sleep, but once again failed. So after I lost z103.5's radio feed, I gave my CD player to Jason to listen to. I got him hooked on some DJ Mystik and Sylver stuff, along with a side of Foggy and INOJ too haha. I've got another person to appreciate the music I like =). It still peeves me off how a lot of people on the sound of the word "techno" INSTANTLY think of MOBY and DARUDE.....  THERE ARE MORE THAN TWO TECHNO/THAT STUFF MUSIC.  Getting that point out and out of my system. Back to where I was. Oh yeah, then Gavin and Carmen each started to listen, and I pointed them to the ones I personally liked a lot anyways. Eventually....surprisingly...that took up the rest of the time back to London....  ....along with a pit stop at a McD's, where we coincedencally bumped into Calvin and them haha. I bought a coffee and two burgers, but when we got out....  Traffic Jam.  So we ended up eating in the car there, and eventually Calvin even left before us. They decided to go head first into the traffic jam, while my dad decided to wait. Eventually though Wendy called and said it wasn't that bad after the McD's area, so we headed out. She was right once again =) When is my Kai-Jei ever wrong haha =P.  So we finally got back on the road, with me getting in a debate with dad and mom about why American SUV/pick-ups own Jap ones. In the end like usual we couldn't come to an agreement, but that's the smaller fish.  There's a bigger fish that I fried....and OWNED hahaha >=).  So for some reason afterwards we got into a debate about whales and if they're cold blooded or warm blooded. Now I know they are warm-blooded, but for SOME strange reason dad said they were cold blooded, even though that means they'd die in the Arctic. Don't remember how I got into this debate, but it was well worth it. I made 20 bucks hahaha, after showing him in fine print that whales, indeed, yes they are.....  Warm-blooded animals.......LIKE ALL OTHER MAMMALS.  Anyways that was what happened after I took everyone home. When I got into London, took Gavin home first, then Jason, then Carmen.....  Ahh yes it was a nice day indeed. One to not be forgotten for awhile hahaha.....  HYPE's next big thing: I'm hoping a camping trip =).  Later.
