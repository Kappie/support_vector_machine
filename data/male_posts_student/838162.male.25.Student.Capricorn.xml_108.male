Was surprised that I actually remembered stuff from my drum lessons during my poly days at the great old Suntec Music Plaza back before they moved. Good memories. Especially the time where I ran into  DaMan  there when we both were with our respective SO at the time.   Heh  . So anyway the lesson was just basically a refresher course but it was good to see the younger ones that are really new to music theory have a go at learning it. Quite fun, I hope they will keep at it. Always have a place for new instrument players, and if they don’t make it on to the Worship team, well my Sound team would be more than willing to take them in.    As for myself, well…I think I need to talk to  CrlSh  about what I want to get out of the lessons. I’m mainly in it for the theory, but don’t mind picking up some keyboard skills. However I’m not looking to actually play up on stage, its more for me to experiment with at home, to know what notes sound good together and what should follow after each note.  In the meantime, I’ve did some searching on the Net for stuff on music theory and came up with an interesting link.   urlLink Musictheory.net   It has a series of lessons done in flash that are quite in depth. Some of them even has sound and there are trainers to help test one's knowledge. Haven't had much time to go throught it yet. Wonder how much I can pick up on my own.
