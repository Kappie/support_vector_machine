There's a reason why I wrote this entry. I'm taking a vacation from myself. I don't know if it's permanent or not, but it's something I have to do. It's time for me to take a break from my personality. It's been a long time coming and I think it's time. To me, helping people is one of the most meaningful things I can do and offers the greatest reward. Though it maybe true, I am myself a hypocrite. One time I told someone this:    "A liFe 2 HeLP oTheRs is MeAninGLesS iF YoU CaN'T FirST HeLP YouRseLF"   I realized that i was so hooked on helping everyone around me with them, that I didn't get a chance to work on myself. My relationship suffered because of it ofcourse. But that's not even the main point. I've been helping everyone around me succeed and make their lives better that I made my life hell. I can't get help from anyone because I'm the one they turn to. I can't help myself and no I can help me. The one person that did help me in a way is gone in that shade of light. He tells me that I gotta do me first. I'm so stubborn so I just shrugged it off. He's right. It is time for me to help myself. I have to work on me. Helping myself is not an easy task. The one thing I really want to work on is my relationship side. I helped on everyone else's relationship that i never worked on my own and in a way took it for granted. I didn't put 110% of myself into it. This is my goodbye to that part of my life.  Christina Aguilera - Cruz   "I'm leaving today Living it, leaving it to change  Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze Tounge tied and twisted are all my memories Celebrating a fantasy come true Packing all my bags Finally on the move  I'm leaving today I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change  As I'm driving, I'm captured by the view So much beauty, the road becomes my muse The heat is rising, and my hand surfs through the wind Cool, calm, collective as a child that lies within  See I'm leaving today I'm living it, oh I'm leaving it to change See I'm leaving today Oh yes, I'm living it, I'm leaving it to change But somehow I'll miss it I think I'll really miss it, one day  I turn on the radio And I'm feeling like Ive never felt before Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams I'm free, finally free  Slowly drifting into the peaceful breeze  I'm leaving today Oh yeah, I'm living it(oh yes), leaving it to change(to change) Oh no, see I'm leaving today(oh yes)  I'm living it(living it)  Leaving to change(ohhh) I'm leaving today Living it, leaving to change Living(to change), leaving to change(oh yeah) Living it, leaving it Said I'm living it, I'm leaving it Living it, leaving it to change I'm leaving it to change But somehow I'll miss it, I think I'll really miss it one day"
