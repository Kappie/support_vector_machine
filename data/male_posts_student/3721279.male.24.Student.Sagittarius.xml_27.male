Well, he opted for shorts rather than his favorite pair of torn-to-hell jeans, only to discover that his small, yet amazingly toned calves would be a bit chilled due to the decision. Curse you Mother Nature, and your unpredictable climate shifts! (shaking fist)  Millersville Unversity's Financial Aid Department is a confusing place. To demonstrate this, I will perform a short, color-coded skit involving myself and a student worker.   Dave- (to student worker) Hi, I was just over at the Bursar's Office, and I was trying to determine if my financial aid had come through yet, so I knew whether or not it would be available to cover my fall bill. They said it had not shown up yet, and that I should come talk to you about it.    Student Worker- (typing on her computer) No, it's in the system.    Dave- Oh good, so it's here.    Student Worker- Yeah, it's on the way.    Dave- Wait, it's on the way? So it's  not  here?    Student Worker- That's what I said.    Dave- Um...(scratching head for effect)...so will I be able to use it to pay my bill? Because that's due on the 16th.    Student Worker- Yeah, it will be here for the 25th, so you'll be fine.    Dave- But that's after...(pause)...how will I pay my bill for the 16th if the money that is here, really  isn't  here until the 25th?    Student Worker- Well you can just write it on your thing.    Dave- Oh right, yeah. My thing. Of course. I got it now. Thanks.....(walking away, defeated)      We have new neighbors next door, so I think Robb, Brian, and I have to actually start monitoring the content of our random, frequent, and loud outbursts of verbal retardation. Oh, and I have to tell my incredibly hot girlfriend to stop being so loud while we're having the greatest sex in the universe. Wait, hold on a minute.....   I had lunch at the Bistro with two of my hot man friends Robb and Matthias. We discussed many things concerning film and writing, and fled in terror when we realized there was an elderly chap on the corner handing out Christian flyers. For a brief moment, I almost felt like I was in high school again, pretending I was some kind of religion-hating deviant...but I didn't. And then the Devil Went Down To Georgia, metal style, and I realized that not only was I running from a messenger of God, but I was going to be driving to York later to impersonate Jesus.  The drive to and from York, however, was quite wonderful. There's nothing like cruising on 30 with your windows down, rockin' out to Ultra Trance, not caring about anything, aside from potentially spilling your diet coke onto your car seat.  I hate having crushes on girls.  I need to go see The Village, but there's no one to see it with. Everyone has already seen it, or is going to see it with a significant other, and therefore will not be available to put their arm around   me   when I want to curl up and soak in some good old-fashioned Shyamalan excitement.  Okay, I'm running out of steam. Talk amongst yourselves. Oh, and just in case anyone was still concerned, I was able to reclaim my penguins from the vile clutches of Jezra. I shall now watch them with greater vigilance. Take that, bird-stealing Libra woman! (shaking fist...er...again)
