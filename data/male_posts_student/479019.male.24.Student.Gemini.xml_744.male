To fill in the gaps for you all in case you want to look at my life in 2001... it starts in March of 2001, when I first started blogging on Asian Avenue. Prior to that... well... I believe March of 2001 was when I first started working regular hours at Nielsen. Prior to that I had a month of idleness due to being laid off at Deposit Saver. That February was a really shitty month for me for so many reasons. I won't go into it here.  So I have entries from March to May. Late June to early August is when I was in Europe. Then I stopped blogging for a while since a certain person who I hate with a passion got pissed off about my blog entries. Long story, but I'm sure that if you know me, then you know about the person I hate with a passion. However, at that time we were still friends... so I stopped posting for a while. Then I started posting again in late November infrequently until I started using blogger.com in February 2002.  ***
