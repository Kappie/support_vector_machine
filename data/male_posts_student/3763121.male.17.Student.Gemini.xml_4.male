Woke up around 10 and worked on my computer and finally got it to work :) . Around 12:30 I put the dogs out and went up to niver western wear. My dad sold his building so i'm helping him clean it out.. which is easier said than done being that its about 30,000 square feet. I cleaned out one room upstairs and threw a lot of stuff away, it felt weird throwing all this perfectly useless stuff, yet still in perfectly good condition, away. I found a lawn mower that had broken a few years ago and put it out by the dumpster, then 10 minutes later i walked out and a black homeless guy was wheeling it away.. i figured it wouldnt stay there for very long : ). Around 3:30 I left and went to yogi's and stopped by to see katey and patrick.. then went home and have been here since.. I'm trying to find something to do this summer to keep me busy.. i don't think FDBD is enough. For those of you who don't know what FDBD is.. I guess I'll post some stuff on it later. I guess thats about it, im leavin in a few minutes to go see farenheit 9/11 with some of the guys, it looks pretty entertaining simply because it makes bush look like a fucktard, but then again, id rather have bush in office than kerry.. ugh. i'll probly add somemore when i get home..  later funky-t
