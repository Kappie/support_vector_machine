For the next eight weeks, I’ll be taking two classes a day, four days a week, working toward an associate degree in computer programming.  The past 4 or five weeks have been really stressful regarding the whole school thing.  In the back of my mind, I  knew  I would be accepted and could start classes, but being officially notified is always better.  I’m also really emotional over the fact that I  am  going back to school at all.  It’s something I was supposed to be doing almost exactly a year ago, but now I am doing it.  So WHOOO!!!  It feels so good to be doing  something   with my life now.  In other news, I turned twenty-four February 20th.  Went with my dad and brother to the hockey game that night, and watched our boys play an amazing game that I can no longer remember the details of.  On Saturday, a neighborhood friend who would be returning to Canada to get back to college the next day invited my brother and me on a day of fun and frolic that I sort of counted as a birthday celebration.  First up was an early dinner at Max and Irma’s.  Seating arrangements around the table, clockwise, starting at myself: my brother, a friend of K’s that she brought out of Canada to the States, K’s brother, her dad and mom.  I had a delicious meatloaf sandwich with sautéed onions and the best restaurant mashed potatoes I’ve had in a long time, along with a bowl of soup that tasted verymuch like chicken quesedillas.  Dinner was excellent, but was so large; I actually had to bring half of my sandwich along with me to the rest of the night’s activities, in which we proceeded to the local movie googolplex to watch Big Fish.  Big Fish was better than I expected, though I don’t really know what I was expecting.  An interesting tale about a son who wants to learn the “truth” about a dying father who turned his life into a series of tall tales; it was quite entertaining, not too preachy, a solid film.    Oh, between dinner and the movie, there was about an hour to kill, so we all spent that time wandering the new location for the Sports Store next to the theatre.  In the soccer equipment isle, my brother put a row of cones across the isle for the next person to come through to figure out.  After the store escapades and the movie we went back to K’s house.  We played a rousing game of 3 on two foosball, K and her brother narrowly beating myself, my brother and J, K’s friend.  After that we sat and talked about our various school experiences and played with the cats for a while.  I had a great time and had fun hanging out with such fun people.  I look forward to doing it again sometime in the near future.
