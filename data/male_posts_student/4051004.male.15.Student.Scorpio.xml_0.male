If you put two people together and asked someone to choose who is "worse", they'll usually pick who is the bigger jerk. In the end, the problem isnt Bush, it's the democrats! We need to stop kidding ourselves. The democrats did not and will not do what is best for us or the modern day world. If the Democrats were a TRUE opposition party Bush would be practically paralyzed. In fact had one Democrat in the House stood up and challenged the electoral college, BUSH WOULDNT BE THERE! Bill after bill has been passed to congress from the Bush occupied white house and welcomed by Democrats. The issue on the bush tax cut was passed overwhelmingly with democratic support even though it was designed to benefit the top 10%. Democrats have also backed Bush on his bombings of Iraq as well. Not only is the fact that many of the bills have such wide democratic support disturbing, the Democrats also approved of EVERY single one of Bush's cabinet nomination. Even controvercial ones like John Ashcroft picked up crucial democratic votes. Did the Democrats forget that Janet Reno was choice number THREE for Clinton..the first two were rejected after Republicans went nuts over  differing views . Democrats have NO spine, in fact I think its safe to say that they have become nothing more than Republican wannabes. And so a new 2 party system must be created. The democrats must merge with the republicans. That way they can keep doing what they do best, representing the top 10. That way the new second party will be able to represent the other 90 percent of america. For all i care, they can breed the donkey with the elephant to make some new mascot for there merger party. I feel that an injunction needs to be made for all present day democrats that will keep them from using the word democrat without the word republican attached to it.  If the democrats can't clean up there act...fuck them and the donkey they rode in on!
