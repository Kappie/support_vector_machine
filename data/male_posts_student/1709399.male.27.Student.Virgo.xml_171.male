Be it Lack of Confidence , Low Self-esteem , Negative Thoughts , Arrogance , Vanity , Dishonesty, laziness everything is reflected in your attitude .                                     I had a chance to attend a Training on Attitude today . I will not say that it has changed my life but definitely implanted a few thoughts worth pursuing . I will try to write/link more posts based on Self-development  inspirational thoughts/stories. Most of us are hypocrites. Either we don't admit our fallibility or dismiss heart-felt thoughts as being too emotional  maudlin .  The greatest leader is one who learns from his mistakes and from others . Let us see if I can manage to implement what I learnt. I would be a happy man even If I live upto 50 % of my idealistic thoughts . As Gandhiji said "you must be the change you wish to see in the world " .
