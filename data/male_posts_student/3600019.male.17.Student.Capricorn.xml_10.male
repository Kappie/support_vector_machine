This is due to the opening talk by the Course Coordinator Fuck him man. =X  Well went out with serene and limin to buy myself a new bag and a new PINK shirt. =P Some commented that the shirt look very ah pak while some say is look good??? Who should I believe? Serene and Limin arh. =) (should well honour okay)  I meet Gen(my new classmate) and 'his stead wannabe' while the three of us are on our way to Hereen to buy my bag. Hmmmmm.. Poly has not even begun and yet she is hooked by some guys from some other course. There must be something attractive about her that I have yet to see. She is the cheerful girl that Iâ€™m talking about before this post.  We moved towards Orchard MRT station at arid 1800 to meet the rest of the Custos gang and went out for dinner before heading towards Esplanade for Truth or Dare. (Classic game?) I found out a lot of secrets though. hehehe Serene u noe wad I am talking about. =P I might to escape from my dare? Was asked to kiss a girl from the girl but I choose to make it into a truth. Korn. Yup! She is not attractive from some angles. She has a chubby face! Shhhhh.... =P
