Herbert wrote quite a few books I've never read, and I'm probably going to look for them at the used store.    I'm about 100 pages into this one, and it's pretty good.  A little dated, but still compelling.  I like the way he has structured it.  He begins almost immediately with the plague being unleashed, and then alternates chapters to explain how we got to this point.  Instead of a bunch of setup, you get the action immediately, with the interludes of background made all the more interesting by the action counterpoints.    So far, I'm entertained.  That's all that matters, right?
