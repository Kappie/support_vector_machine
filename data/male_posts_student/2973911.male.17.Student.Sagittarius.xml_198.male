Discontented lovers always go to their girlfriends' best friends. 3. Relationships without sex, no matter how young, are bound to fail. 4. The nicest people are usually insane. 5. Good people don't just die young--good people  want  to die young. 6. 96 is a low and abominable grade. 7. Faggots are actually accepted in the family.  Furthermore, fathers accept gay sons if a pretty young girl talks to them. 8. No matter how much you don't want people to see your private life, privacy is dead when you are dead.  Even if you have an embarrassing story (or a funny story), people cry over your diary. 9. In a typical barkada, the only real guy is probably the suitor of the most gorgeous of the pack.   10. Teachers love to gossip about their students.  Okay, so maybe reality is sarcastic, but the story revolves around realistic characters that deserve a body in a real world.  How your classmates couldn't memorize the lines, I don't know, but the lines are perfectly natural without losing the retoric value of theatre.  For this play, I'll give you a candy  and balloon.
