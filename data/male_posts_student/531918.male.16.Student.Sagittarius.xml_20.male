Then, they created  The Real World  back in 1992 or so, and that channel ended.  Have you turned on MTV lately?  It's all reality shows contemplating the importance of the differences between chicken and tuna.  VH1 was okay, for a while.  Nowadays, the entire VH1 programming consists of three things: - Countdowns featuring rehashed clips from previous shows -  The Fabulous Life of  (insert celebrity here) - Pointless VH1 "Goes Inside" specials  Then, there was The Box... for eight months or so, anyway.  This channel (hosted by MuchMusic, I believe) allowed viewers to call in and request videos.  It was nothing but videos.  Its demise came on January 1st, 2001, when it was replaced with...  ...MTV2.  This was  my  channel to watch for a good amount of time.  I mean, last year was great.  On Saturdays, 8:00pm was  MTV2 Rock Countdown , hosted by Dee Snider's kid, and  Headbanger's Ball  followed at 10:00 (which I'm now a little scared to watch).  The time for the countdown has been pushed back to 7:00, Jesse got the boot because the network opted for Jim Shearer, whom I hope gets teabagged by an elephant, and MTV2 mainly airs - guess what - reruns of MTV's current lineup.  (To add insult to injury, MTV now has created MTV Hits and MTV Jams, two new stations that "play music videos 24 hours a day".  Sound familiar?)  Fuse.  Fuse was the Holy Grail at one time.  I hope they get their act together, because Fuse has started to play rap.  That is bad.  Fuse was the indie/rock/alternative station that I love so much.  They haven't irritated me all the way yet, but they're starting to with this  Daily Download  bull, as well as possibly the worst show they have:  Authentic Hip-Hop . (Fortunately, this comes on at midnight, when I'm preoccupied by David Letterman.)  You want some real music?  Check out this  urlLink link .  Pitchfork Media has some good album reviews for CDs that matter (and some that don't... *cough* Kanye West *cough*).  Or, you could download on whatever software you use (BearShare is my favorite) what I'm listening to.  By the way, that song by The Secret Machines is quite possibly the best song I've heard in quite some time.  Thanks Letterman (again) for introducing me to them.
