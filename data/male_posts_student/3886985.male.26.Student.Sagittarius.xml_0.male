PoliSci 10 went well, and I felt pretty confident about almost all of the exam; PoliSci 12 was a little worse - I felt good about the essay, but not so good about 2 of the 5 IDs.  So I did what any good student does; take your best guess, and try to make a little humor, hoping the TA will laugh when grading and give me a few more points. :D  So how long of a break do I get until the second Summer Session classes start? Oh. I get the weekend off. Yay me.  Crap... I need a break.
