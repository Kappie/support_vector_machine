I initially like my Nokia 3200 very much... then after that Nokia 6230 come out... i oso like it very much... then Nokia 6610i... Now i like Nokia N-gage QD!!!  i can't stand myself!!! i feel so 'depressed'... You like the fone but u cant own it... Get the feeling? I experience how elaine feel... she like samsung X430, but she oso like sony ericsson... hard to decide, yeah?  haiz... but i couldn't afford to buy those lah... juz kinda tempted... my goal for now is to own a mp3 player... i'm contented (for now!!)... hehe...  cya...
