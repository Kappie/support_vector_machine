Run for the shower!   So, okay this morning sucked. I am so preoccupied with so many things...   Is copper the limiting reagent?   Did I pass my midterms?   What am I gonna have for lunch?      Okay...I'm done with my shower. I'm gonna wear this gray polo shirt and my faded maong pants...gotta start the day right with my Yakisoba breakfast....       At the Ateneo, CTC 112:  DAMN! No more computers left...aaahhh! Okay, don't panic...head for Prince David...just a ten-minute walk...      ...after one hour and 25 minutes...      I'm done with my post lab! Yeepee!

At least my day ended right with an Alfredo. I just hope I pass the midterms.      The Midterms   It is already 8 pm and I am on the last number of this 11-item 200-point exam-that-is-like-so-yuck! Okay...I need to get a quadratic function...Got it! YES! I can now get my minimum point...x is equal to 2,246.56??? What the...my x should be super less than 60!!! Dammit...panic...panic....      Sir Cabral: Okay, time's up...pass your papers...yes, Ms. Serena, you have to staple them together...      Me to myself: I hope I passed.      THOUGHT: Oooohh...I was able to solve everything. But duh?! Did you get them all right? Head back to reality baby!      An Hour Before   These chicken tenders are so yummy. I can eat two of these. But I can't be too full. I may get a stomach ache. Or worse LBM. I can't have that! I may not get to my 6 pm midterms...Okay, just one chicken tender...      Munch...munch...God, please no food poisoning today...I have to get to SOM 105 for the midterms...God forbid the bacteria from invading my food...      Okay, no more studying. I had enough! Condition your mind...okay, so now I am officially freaking out..I am having dragonflies in my stomach...yes I know they're butterflies...am not stupid...I wish the math midterms is not that long...      A Day Before   I am lying on my bed...I can't sleep, I have to pray first...Aubert's asleep?...Okay, no FRIENDS for today...no Chandler sarcasm...no Phoebe-stupidity...no O.C.
