If I hear another cheesy announcer say that is "old school" or that's the way it used to be done, I am going to lose my mind. Every single bike show and builder uses the same techniques it seems like. They all know how to use metal/gold/silver flakes in their paint, and they all bend steel and aluminum so I what's the catch? They are all the same!!! The designs are different yes, but they all use the same techniques I swear!!!! So high class and yuppized. You know what's real and old school? Some poor bloke that is fixed his piece of crap Honda or whatever in his garage himself or trying to paint it himself!!! That's old school!   In other new, I am going to see my friend at her work to get some of my DVD's back that I want to watch. I don't think it will go well. I bet my left eye that soon as I walk in there, she will hand me the DVD's and walk away. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. Well, I could go to Taco Bell afterwards. Yeah, that sounds like a plan. A stupid plan but its my plan!
