He had studied well for them and was now suffering from SDS (sleep deficiency syndrome). But, atleast during the exam days he had something to do. Now, he was completely bored, had nothing to do. His life was like a pendulum  “Eighty first street, let ‘em out please”, yelled the shepherd in blue A flock of school sheep rolled out and no other flock got on, coz it was the time to go home (duh). They day had finally come, the day when the exams ended, the day which everybody was waiting for. But, the following days were not all that gr8  His days were all the same He used to get up late, have breakfast and well jus kill time. No katy used to be there with her confectionate, affectionate kiss coz well no katy existed in his life. But this day began differently…he felt older….. nobody was there at home….he looked through the letters….there was one for him…. It said happy budday(22nd)..yayyy….happy budday  This was the first time it happened to him in this year   This entry sure was stupid and I guess it shows how bored I am Hmmm I better go now ciao
