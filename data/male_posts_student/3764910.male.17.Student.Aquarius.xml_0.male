We mucked about on the beach for a bit while Stuart sat dranking his half bottle of Jack d's and some jeebs were getting passed. We went back to the campsite about 12:30. Stuart fell over at least 4 times and was going mental, but it was funny annoying him. He went to sleep pretty much straight away which gave me time to burn his hair for about 10 minutes. I'll add more to this, but the highlight was stuart drinking tomato and piss soup and saying " aye, it's dead good *slurp*". It wasn't so good when he found out lol.
