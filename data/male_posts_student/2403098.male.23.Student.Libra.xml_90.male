My alarm went off, and in between snooze 1, 2, 3 and 4, I could hear the rumble of thunder outside.  The lack of bright light coming through the curtains alluded to the fact that there was probably not much sunlight outside, confirming the thunder's weather forecast.  I LOVE rainy days.  I wandered into the living room, Boomer (dog) following me along.  I think I even verbally (okay I know I did) said "Boomer you're lucky you get to stay home today."  He just wanted to eat and pee though.  I hope this gentle rain continues throughout the entire day.  That would make me happy.  I think rain all the time would be kind of depressing, so it's not like I'm going to race off to Seattle to live.  Days like this, however, are a welcome change to me.  They actually make me feel more productive, like I'm able to get things accomplished in the safety of the indoors and I'm not missing a damn thing outside.  Besides, it's like a nice, soothing soundtrack to my day.  As if, however, if it were sunny I'd be biking around town or something though, but whatever.  Toodle-doo.. cruisin' around on my bike, maybe with a basket on the front of it, whatever, you don't know.  I don't own a bike.  If I did it wouldn't have a basket on it.  I wish I did own a bike though, and I think it's something that I will purchase whenever I move to Chicago.  As long as the area I live in is conducive to bike riding, consider it done.. basket and all.  Okay, no basket but I will toodle-doo around town.  well no toodle-doo, but I WILL ride it.. maybe.
