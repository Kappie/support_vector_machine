The main topic of discussion that night was about Michael Moore,  Fahrenheit 9/11 , and basically how wrong it is.  Liberals around the world, if they saw this programming, would go "Whaaa?".  Granted, I haven't seen the movie.  However, through clips and commercials (and an oddly-placed trailer when I saw  Envy  in April), the movie paints a cinematic picture of how Bush isn't exactly  wrong  for going into Iraq, but he triggered events that directly led to the invasion.  These ÃœBER-Republican religion buffs didn't bother to mention anything about the plot of the movie or what Moore tried to accomplish.  Instead, they accused him of being "Anti-Bush" and encouraging kids to go vote in November (two things I'm positive Moore is).  However, these motives were brought in a negative fashion.  On another note, the following was a question (not directly quoted, because I didn't exactly write it down) from a viewer):  "My church is creating a recreational center for its youth.  They are including books, a foosball table, and Xboxes (X-boxs, as they put it).  Are these items okay for a church atmosphere?"  And, the response (also not directly quoted), which starts off innocently enough but turns into a very narrow-minded reply:  "Children need something to do, so I think the games are okay for the children.  Youth are not going to go to something that is, well, boring.  As long as they realize that they are in a house of God, it will be okay.  A good idea would be to include God-related video games, which I would imagine they included.  I don't want to see any 'Grand Theft Vice Auto Town 3' shooting bonanza.  Children should learn to be faithful whenever possible, so religious games, I feel, are the only solution.  Foosball is too violent, so I do not suggest that.  Books are good, although the only book kids should be reading is the Bible, for the Bible rules all.  Bibles will also prevent homosexuality from spreading since it clearly states that God does not tolerate a man lying with a man like he would with a woman.  You know what, scratch all that.  Games and books are not good in a church, for it detracts from the Church.  All kids should value God in His house, and that will be the child's fun throughout his youth.  Vote for Bush."  I realize I made that last part up, but these guys are very extreme.  He also contradicts his Grand Theft Auto beliefs by stating that he is a prominent defender of the Second Amendment (the right to bear arms, for all my uneducated friends).  Hmm.  I think it's funny why conservatives are confused why people don't like Bush and his supporters.
