I can one day blog alot of nonsense de. Dont know why. Anyway...  Today sucks. At least till now. Today test was NMM, Network Multimedia. Shit the subject. Thought that it will be damn easy. What the hell lorhz... The paper 15 pages lehz! And also some part is like 'how to do? thought this part is suppose to be in the lab or the project thingy'. What the hell lorhz. I guess this subject I also hardly pass de. Borderline fail or worse. I hate it. I hate this semester. All hard subjects.  How dare I shall whine about one thing. That Victor. How dare he! Dont know why he carry a hp for what? Happily dont pick up phonecall and seldom sms. Save money until like that. I reached school early today and wanted to meet him de then he happily never pick up phone and happily never reply my sms. What the hell. I guess he know that I'm quite pissed off at him. How dare.  After the test, went eating with him. How dare he suggest to eat. As you know, I need to save money mahz. Then he happily tell me go eat. Then I kena 'lured' mahz and cannot controlled myself so I eat lorhz. Then then then... I happily eat alot alot. What the hell. I'm trying to save money and trying to lose weight lehz... What the hell!  Sms Vincent and ask him how's he's doing and such. Called Willy for fun and he happily invited me to go out today. Still thinking lorhz. Need to waste money lehz. And quite tired now.  No sms from Donkey... 2 days le...  Anthemis, what should I do now... Argh...
