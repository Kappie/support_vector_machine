What the game is themed on primarily this time, (different from the previous style of a Mario copy) is speed based mayhem which is much more traditonaly sonic like. From the start where the character gets on the starting blocks for a "race" to the end where bonus points are added according to how fast you were going across the finish line. Even the bosses are speed based, with robotnics car thingy continuosly running away from you, with you having to catch up and bounce him. The annoying pop up spikes at the end of every glorious run heavily featured in the first game are no were to be seen. Tedious jumping is also absent and best of all the stupid character Amy Rose isn't featured (well she's unlockable but who cares). Amy is replaced by a much more worthy rabbit called cream who like Tails can fly. She has a chao flollowing her (the little baby things from sonic adventure) allowing for unique fun tricks and skills, like sending "cheese" the chao homing in on enemies in mid flight. In most levels its possible to hold the right d-pad down and get through the level, although you may not get the spec. Rings and experience the level it exemplifies the fluidity of this new rendition. Tricks added to jumps allow for secret areas to be reached and lightning fast runs, especially with the new speed mechanics pushing the character off the screen all create a true classic. If looking for a new game to pass the time I recommend this game totally. Its a much better game than the last one for gba and worth my money.  If you cant find it in the store use  urlLink eBay . Internet trading is the future and you should support it. Its also quite cheap and if you're not buying the game for release purposes you should buy it on eBay.
