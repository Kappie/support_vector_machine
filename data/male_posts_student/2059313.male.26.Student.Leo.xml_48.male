The road is mostly smooth again, and I'm feeling much better.  This trip was the closest thing to rock climbing that I've ever done, and just being outdoors was amaing.  The group of people that I was with really made the day... especially since I was able to share it with my best friend.  I had one weak moment this afternoon where I would have likee to shar the moment with a significant other... but it was only a feleetign moment, particularly after I looked back around and noticed I was surrounded by loving and caring friends, and again looking nex to me to see my friend Stephanie.  God, You are truly amazing.  How great it  is to see all these people share themselves with you and each other.  Lord, thank You for EVERTYTHING. Thank you for sending these people into my life.  Thank You for Stephanie and Ben for pushing me, challenging me, helping me grow as a Christian, and getting me involved in this church.
