Here's some of what I have so far:  If morality is going to be absolute and binding, it needs to come from a divine authority.  Although, I don't think morality is the consequent of God's creative whims.  In other words, I don't think God arbitrarily choose some acts to be good, others bad, and others indifferent.  Some things like rape and infanticide seem to be morally wrong in all possible worlds.  For me, this is like the truths of basic math.  God, even though he is all-powerful could not have forced 1+1 to equal -18.  Of course, the difference between math and morality is that math lacks a moral imperative.  Like my first sentence says, I don't have the details worked out, but here's my rough and ready explanation.  Morality (and math)  need  God to exist.  God being perfectly good and wise knew prior to creation what logical boundaries would pertain to creation.  So, morality exists as a result of God's will and is enforced by his divine authority.  I know I still have a long ways to go, but this is a start.
