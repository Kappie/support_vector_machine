That is because I quell most of the hateful feelings that I have. That doesn't mean I never complain, it just means I could complain a lot more. From what i have gathered, I do this because of my parents. Every time I'd come home from school and tell them that friend x pushed me or called me a dumb name, (honeybutt was fairly common back in the day), my parents would immediatly issue a fatwa against them. Nothing that person could do would redeem themselves in my parents eyes. They would openly express every other time I mention that person, in good light or bad, how little they think of them. That really bugs me. I've been a jerk to all of my friends and vise versa. My parents hear about next to none of this though, because I don't want them to bash my friends whom I forgive on my own accord. I HATE when my parents do that. What are they trying to prove?  For example, I invited a few guys to my bible study this week. Not one of them attended even after having said they would enjoy going. Yes, I was hurt, and I felt slightly betrayed. Yet, I shall not mention this to my parents because I have slipped onother occasions as well. I am not perfect, nor are my friends. My parents believe themselves to be though, and consequently anyone who hints imperfection is immediatly dead to them.   I hesitated to tell them about Jackie. Still to this day, they are unaware of about 75% of our relationship. Inheretly I knew it would flounder in one way or the other. I knew something would blow up. I hate being right all the time. But I dare not tell them the what the real conclusion of that book was, for in the unlikely event I ever speak to her again, they would frown upon it. I carry these burdens, these lies on my back. Though I know not the reason for doing so. What good have I accomplished? Who am I serving? Not myself, that much is true. I do not have a friend whom I can converse with about everything. Ben for politics, Jake for girls/girl problems, Nathan for gaming/school crap, and Gus for obscure and unimportant things. I dare not talk to Ben about girls, nor about politics with Jake.   So now we're at the conclusion. I met this one girl. Jackie is physically more attractive than her. But she is so much more  beautiful  than Jackie could ever be. I could stare into her eyes for two eternities. It's not just the beauty in her eyes though. I can see past them into an keen and unbridled intelect. Aye she is smart. Words fail me when attempting to describe her. I am a writer: pictures to words, events to words, words to even better words. Still, I couldn't conjure up anything to capture her. She just is.   Enter inreconcileable flaw: Boyfriend. How that accursed word plauges me when not attatched  to  me. She cares for him deeply, every time she's off doing something, she is with him, or so it seems. She once told me she loves me as a friend, and him as a boyfriend. So it's all about choice. Altruism or selfishness. Putting myself in the boyfriend's shoes, I would hate me for doing what I want to do. Break them up and seat myself in his position. Yet back inside my own shoes, which I am more fond of wearing, that seems perfect. Why concern myself with someone I've only met once? Does my being kind prevent others from hurting me? What debt do I owe, what cross must I carry, but more importantly why? Perhaps my selfishness is not right, but it would ease my pain. What must one do to attain true contentment? What journey, what storm must be braved? Am Ieven ready?    Fight on noble paladin...
