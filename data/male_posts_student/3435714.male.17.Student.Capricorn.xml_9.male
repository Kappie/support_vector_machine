Imagine this driving 1/2 way across the country with:  -The dad who is a pator, who occasionally looses his temper or gets confused easily  -The mom who is trying as hard as she can to hold the family together,  -The emotionally unstable brother who is ready to snap at any given moment     and takes refuge in his own mind (me)  -The blonde haired, blue eyed mac daddy with a 2 second attention span     and hates almost everything on the planet  -The hyperactive brother who is trying to grow up and be a kid at the same time  -The weird little sister, i mean weird  -The self centered, destructive, annoying cousin  -The cool math teacher aunt who could kick your and all your friends      butts with no problem  and finally  -The grudge holding angry grandmother.  So throw all that in a van and a camper and ship it half way across the country  Add a little rain 10 out of the 13 nights and what do you have?  MY FAMILY VACATION.  Now if you exscues me, i should get some sleep.  I have to be on a bus at 10:30 tonight to go to   Colorado for 2 weeks, then i come home  have a few days rest then........  Off to Soulstice: Christian concert super hang out.  So until august 17th or soish,  Dark Rocker
