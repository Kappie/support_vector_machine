I also met a guy named Chris, who plays guitar and lead vocals in a metal band near Chicago. Hes cool because he likes old metal and doesnt wear tight leather, and thats damn cool in my book. The good thing is he hates Numetal, for which I am thankful. Tomorrow I am going down to my grandfathers to trim bushes and do some landscaping stuff (you know, because I'm so caring). I will have to leave on Tuesday to go visit cousins in Illinois for three days. Another bit of random news, my grandfather turns 100 years old on the 24th. Which no one would probably care less about but hey its my blog. I will also be trying to get my mom's digital camera working so I can take some pictures of places/people and the general hell in which I live.     Song of the Day: "Man In the Box" by Alice In Chains    Soda Fountain Suicides News: Still working on Judith, met a girl named Alison who knows our drummer Jon Kenny, when I asked her how she knew him she said "ya no, i dont remember". She lives all the way in Alabama.
