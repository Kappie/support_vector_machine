I think to myself, "Sure, why not? I wanted to gorge myself on dim sum anyhow, might as well heighten the experience." Six minutes later, we emerge from the alley and go back onto the main drag of produce stores and antique shops, looking for a decent place to eat. My friend (yeah, protecting his name) spends most of his time testing each dim sum and Chinese barbecue joint he passes, so he knew the exact one he wanted to go to. For whatever reason, before we got to eat, he decided to guide me through all the trippiest places within a six block radius. Most things I could deal with: herb shop, toy store, smack junkie alleyway landmarks, etc. But he was only getting started. Soon, we turned into a fresh fish market. Now, I know fish markets are nothing to be freaked out about, even on drugs, but fish markets differ by location. For most folk, a fresh fish market means different cuts of fish and crustaceans, sliced in various fashions, kept frozen or chilled, behind glass at your local supermarket or deli. In Chinatown, fresh fish markets consist of different species fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and amphibians, some flopping around in plastic boxes with shallow amounts of water, and some piled on top of each other in bins. Besides the stench being overwhelming, some fish and turtles have their innards spilled out, like this:    Normally, I don't have a problem with organs, muscles, tissues, blood, other bodily fluids, etc, but for some reason, my drug tainted mind just raced and I all but flipped out. My  urlLink breathing sounded like that from the Depeche Mode song, Personal Jesus , and it stayed that way until we made it out of Chinatown and into North Beach.  North Beach is comparatively less stimulating, yet my friend managed to have me blow my cool a few more times. One of the places he took me into was a cutlery shop, pulsing with techno, to take a gander at knives. Somewhere in the middle of our browsing, I asked him if he knew the status of switchblades. I hadn't seen one being sold anywhere, and naturally assumed they were illegal. He thought the same thing, but just to be safe, he asked one of the clerks. We were both still acting goofy and I didn't want to engage anyone normal in any conversation, let alone on the legality of certain items. The clerk was an extremely jolly (plump) middle aged woman who appeared to be working there with her husband for a long, long while. She bluntly confirmed that switchblades were 100% illegal, but quickly launched into, "We have some lovely  alternatives  to switchblades, however!" She pulled out four medium sized knives and arranged them in a line on the glass case in front of us. "These are called 'assisted blades,' and they're very similar to switchblades..." She picked one up and pulled her finger down the hilt of the knife, swinging the blade out with a flash. I tried not to look too surprised as I smiled at her. She went through their specs, locks, sizes, choices of finishing, and prices before handing one knife to my friend and another to myself. He flicked the knife out, moved it around in the air, passed it from hand to hand, and turned to me going, "What do you think, fast enough?" and "I don't think this is sharp enough..." And "Will Kevlar gloves stop this?"  I'm not suggesting that one shouldn't go out high into the world, more the opposite, but if I had been on something stronger, I probably would've had massive panic attacks with the turtles and pulsing techno.   (I'm aware that some of the people reading this may be upset to find that I've used drugs, but I promise that I'm being as responsible as I can with them, and would never go into a dangerous situation while impaired. Nor am I forgetting my normal responsibilities and obligations to my school, family, or self-being.)
