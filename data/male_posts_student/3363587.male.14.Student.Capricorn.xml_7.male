Although where we performed our repertoire wasn't actually IN the CC...but rather outside...across the street in the middle of a couple of HDB blocks. Not many people were seen there...save a few groups in the concourse area and perhaps alot more up in the corridors looking down at the Titans below. ~TITANS RULE!~   We acTually had to repeat a few songs over again...around two songs were played twice...the competition repertoire was one of them...man...my arms were about to fall off after the second one...=D Well well, who would've known? Zack continued the tradition I set during my first year in the band. During every major performance since I started playing the drumset I would ALWAYS drop my stick(s) while playing Tequila. Hahaz...Zack wanted to play the song yesterdae, so I let him. And little did I know what was coming. He dropped both sticks during the solo part and I had to take over and recover. He's learning I can see. Although he seemed pretty phobious of the drumset after that incident. He still has a lot to learn...I don't blame him. Neither does the band.  The preparation and the keeping of the chairs and intruments was a horror...much time was taken up. I still remember the time when one of the toms dropped right off the drumset after my junior (who shall NOT be named) attempted to carry it all the way. The poor guy had to hold on to the tom whilst we used the drumset in case it fell off. I guess my section leader's words didnt entirely get into his head. We let him hold on to something that would'nt fall apart when he touched it after the performance.  Surprisingly, I wasn't a bit nervous while conducting Final Countdown...I just went with the flow, and the band followed intently. Luckily I remembered to go faster after the first four bars...And I felt so relieved when I didn't mess up big time during my own drumset solos...Thanks to Ben for not holding the last note so long...=P Yeah...great day that was...Need to prepare for the MOE rehearsal tomorrow...I think I've written enough...cyaz!!
