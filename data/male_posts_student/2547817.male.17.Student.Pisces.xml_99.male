She was cold throughout the whole time she sat there. I got no smile from her. Everyone else did. She lies about friendship. I have a snapshot in my head and on my screen.  I looked at her hands. She eats the same way still. Utensils almost vertical, held close to the middle awkwardly yet correctly. Don't bite your nails and crack your knuckles. Do it for me, I pleaded then. My hands have been there, held them, caressed them. Loved them.  It hit me again that she might not be worth it too. She's in the league. Just like most others who can't handle it. I've observed that it's a general trend with Singaporean girls. Can't talk, Uncomfortable, Angst... What's new boys? I want to believe that, to move on coz it's not bearable. But no. She's different. Worth my suffering for. I do, every hour, every day. We'll all get hit sooner or later. So hang on to her. As so eloquently it was put across by Sugar Ray, "We're on this rollercoaster ride, hold on I'll stay here by your side, We'll head up to the sky and we slide back down". Bumpy ride boys, hold on and suck it all up. Do you remember Jesus of the passion, shredded, splintered, bleeding, tortured, carrying his cross alone. I am he now. Save for being impure.  I'm trying to find the fine line- the international boundary, where pride ends, and self confidence begins.  When you think about them, or want them to, so that you feel understood, songs will be your friends. 3 songs I can think of now. First song, I thought of was a few days ago-Heaven Knows. Second was yesterday- Yesterday. Third was today as I walked home- Don't look back in anger. I should dedicate it to her.  Cheers to you and a bright future.
