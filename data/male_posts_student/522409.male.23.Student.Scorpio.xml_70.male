I'd be sorry about that, but I'd have to want lots of people to understand me for me to do that, and I just don't.  I like it when they try, and take no real pleasure in their inevitable failure.  It's just reality, and I'm a realist.  But that's old news, and I'm here to say something relatively new.  I say relatively, because it's an old theme, new way of looking at it, maybe.  I dunno... maybe I just had a narcissistic need to post my thoughts online.  Whatever the reason, I'm posting.  I've been giving some thought to the girl who never goes away.  I'm never going to not think about her.  Ever.  8 years I've been thinking about her, and now we're really great friends, and she's not going anywhere. (well, aside from halfway around the world, but what's a few thousand miles between friends?)  I've recently been giving thought to the disturbing idea that we'll never be together... sure, for a while, I harbored delusions that she'd come back from her time away, older, wiser, ready to find 'the one' (these may all be true), and realize that 'the one' was right there all along--her faithful friend through thick and thin. (that part is utterly ridiculous) The boy who wrote her letters while she was away.  I fantasized that all that I was going to make of myself in the coming years was going to somehow be exactly what she wanted when the time came.  I also told myself that I really wasn't thinking any of this... I'm a fantastic liar, at least when dealing with myself.  So the thing is this, and I realized this when I was talking to a dear friend at school (I passed it off as though I had realized it some time ago and was just reiterating the point, but the fact is, I only realized it right then.), she and I can't be together because neither of us wants to marry/be with the kind of person the other is.  That... was poor English.  But stick with me here, because I don't think the thought itself was incoherent.  Our value systems work together really well.  Very important.  Lots of other stuff works, but she's really athletic and outdoorsy.  She's going to want a guy who's like her... uber-athletic, who wants to go camping and biking, and stuff like that.  I am very definitely not that guy (even though I spent this summer working out to get myself back into that kind of shape, and while I'd love to deny that she was the motivation, consider this my confession.)  I, on the other hand, am artsy, and I love doing artsy things.  Not absurd lame-ass artsy stuff... but I love music, and museums, and art, and history, and dance, and all that.  All of it.  That's what I want to surround myself with for the rest of my natural life.  I want to be with someone who not only feels the things I do, but feels them the WAY I do.  That is, if I want to be with anyone at all. (that's for another entry)  She would never write in a blog.  I don't know that she goes through complex emotional phases, or that she ever feels the need to sort them out in any sort of journal.  I assume these things at my own peril, of course.  I may be totally wrong, and then what kind of friend am I?  But whatever.  We're never going to be together.  She doesn't want my type, I don't want hers.  Unless it's her.  See why this never ends?  She's always the exception to every sweeping generalization designed to bring me comfort from the destruction she wreaks on my emotional state.  That's why, 8 years later, I'm still making stupid excuses as to why I don't care whether she'll ever love me.  I don't need validation from anyone else in my life, but I need it from her.  And that pisses me off, because I've spent the last 4 years building myself up from the worst self-esteem in the world, to where I finally don't really care about what anyone thinks of me, because I know that I am a good person, and a talented person, and a lovable person.  And there's this one person who throws a hammer through that whole idea, and I'd love to hate her for it, but I can't.  Maybe I'm not strong enough.    Or maybe this is just the great enigma of my life.  The one great tragedy.  He's come so far, but he can never be totally free of her, and how awful is that?  Poor boy.  But I am not a poor boy, and that's why this enrages me, and why I cannot lay the issue to rest.  It's like Steph's problem with Slick.  No one gets to her, and he did, and WHY?  But he'll never tell her what he said that made her react the way she did, and she can't remember, and that is tragic, because she's so strong.  Why is there always that one person who won't let you be as perfect as you want to be?  All I want is to be a goddamn brick wall.  No flaws, no gaps.  One door that I open when and only when I feel like it.    She called me on my birthday, you know that?  From halfway across the world, because she "didn't want her birthday wish to me to come through IM."  That's a great friend.  And that's why I refuse to take the one step that could put me on the road to forgetting her forever.  I love to hear her voice, and I love to know she's smiling, and I love to love her in whatever capacity I can, because when God puts someone that wonderful in your life, you'd better be grateful.  And I am grateful.  Thank you, God, and thank you, you.  Because without your friendship and your smile and your laugh and your voice, and "Bedtime Magic" with David Allan Boucher, and "In Too Deep", and "Name that Composer", and "Right Now", and power ballads in the Wendy's parking lot at 1am, and your soft french fries and my hard ones, and losing arm wrestling matches to you, my life is so much less colorful and vibrant.  And that's why I'm always going to love you with every cell in my body.  I hope that's okay.  I miss you.     "the moon's a fingernail, and slowly sinking, another day begins, and now I'm thinking that this indifference was my invention when everything I did sought your attention. you were my compass star, you were my measure, you were a pirate's map of buried treasure. if this was all correct, the last thing I'd expect,  the prosecution rests, it's time that I confess:  I must have loved you." -Sting, "Ghost Story"
