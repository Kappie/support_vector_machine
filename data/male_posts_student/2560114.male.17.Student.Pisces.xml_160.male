On the way there though, meeesh was goin about 79 milez/hour and the speed limit was 55, and a cop pulled us ova and gave him a ticket for speeding, so it was pretty rough. Then we got to the game and pepperdine lost the 1st match. Then freakin sean rooney or whateva jus dominated hawaii and won 3 straight. Alfred did pretty good but they made a lot of unforced errorz. Then yeah, im here, lata.
