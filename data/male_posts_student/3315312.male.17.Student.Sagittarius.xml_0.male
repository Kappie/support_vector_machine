Sivits earlier this week (one year in prison along with testifying against other guards) was much too lenient. The soldiers that decided it would be a good idea to pour acid on a prisoner's back or force them to have sex with each other should spend a long, long time in prison. That would also go a long way to convincing the rest of the world that the United States punishes harshly for breaking military law.   What Joe next goes into, and where we disagree, is that the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld is warranted right now. Yes, Joe, the buck does stop at Rumsfeld's desk. Yes, he should have been aware and probably was aware, of the fact that certain interrogation methods were being used. Last fall the Red Cross brought the fact that there might be abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to the attention of the administration. There were, according to Secretary of State Colin Powell "High level talks" about the possibility of abuse. However, nothing was done. Why is this?  Interrogation is not a pretty thing. Anybody who's seen an episode of Law and Order knows what I'm talking about. Interrogation (and completely legal interrogation) in a war zone is even worse. Before a couple weeks ago no one would have even considered abuse as damming as the red cross said was occurring in it's report, which (excerpted from the executive summary) ranged from  * Brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury;  * Absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families;  * Physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information;  * Prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight;  * Excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment....  Most of these methods are perfectly legal and within the bounds of the Geneva Convention and are used by militaries worldwide. The rest could easily be seen by the administration as the exaggerations of an organization which has been against the occupation from day one.  Also, any use of interrogation methods that might be construed as violating the Geneva convention have since been banned although they were never legally used in Iraq, as none of these methods were ever requested for (in order to use them a prison had to get the ok of the commanding general) meaning that any use of them was completely illegal.   With all these facts weighing in plus the overriding need to keep constant leadership in a time when the balance is so fickle (official turnover to the Iraqis will occur in a bit more than a month) Rumsfeld mustnâ€™t get out of office. His sheer workload, drive, and sense of public duty make him right now the best man for the job. Now is not the time to have someone getting used to a job at a time when necessity demands a 12 hour workday 7 days a week. Also, Joe, Rumsfeld ain't exactly Richard Nixon, now is he? I don't see him blatantly doing any criminal acts, like, say lying to a grand jury. In fact, he's done quite the opposite. He's owned up to his failures and he knows that he has to be even more aware and even more vigilant of exactly what the military is doing.  I also, sadly, have to agree with Joe's conclusions about America's image. I was just watching the daily show tonight (Gasp! A conservative who can laugh!) and he had an Arab mention something about how he'd feel, that in order to make a comparison, we should picture "what it would be like if Iraqis were doing it to Americans on American soil." I only hope that the turnover to Iraqi control will go well and the whole situation in the middle-east won't spiral out of control, no one wants the plot of a bad Tom Clancy book happening in real life...
