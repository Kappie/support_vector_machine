I was out 'til 2:30 last night, got up at 7:15 this morning, and I still have my dad's birthday dinner left. eww.   But hey. It's all worth it. I was up all night last night dancing on the stage at dream. I thought I was making a fool of myself, but apparently not. Some guy saw me on my way out, and he was like "Hey. Your a good dancer. You were tearin' it up tonight". I think his name was Randall...maybe. Thanks for the confidence boost Randall.   BTW...If anyone knows a gay boy who might wanna meet me, let me know. LOL. No, seriously. I'm friggen desperate.
