However, in the name of objectivity, I'm going to cover both the good and the bad aspects.   First the good, as it's so little:   This movie really accentuates just how hard it is for Peter Parker and Spiderman to coexist. With so much crime fighting, Parker's life goes to shit. This is incredibly deep, and while it's covered in the comics quite well, such things are usually left out of "action" movies. As this isn't the central point of the movie, I won't really ruin it by saying that Parker actually gives up being Spiderman (for a while) and loses his powers.   Another positive aspect is the effects. It seems that someone finally realized that the key to effective CGI is to not make it stick out by having backgrounds that accentuate it. Bravo. They definitely raised the bar since the first movie.   Now comes the bad stuff:   The villain. Doctor Otto Octavius. True, he is kind of a nerd (most physicists are)and slightly overweight in the comics, but damn, Alfred Molina looks like a friggin' garbage man. And the trench coat? WHY? By FAR the worst cast role and worst translated villainin this or any other movie.   The plot. Aside from Parker struggling with the duality of Spiderman, this is incredibly poor. The duality struggle needn't even be included (you KNOW he has to go back to being Spiderman in order to save the city/world). But the whole "scientist's experiment fails so he has to try it again" is so damn hollow. WHY does he have to try it again in the exact same way, but bigger? It failed, that's science. Move on, try some variation.   Perhaps the worstaspect isthe transitions. This movie was so obviously filmed out of sequence that it's scary. It clunks along like someone throwing pots and pans and catsdown the stairs. The characters all go through some kind of "metamorphosis" that's supposed to be really deep and philosophical, but instead is hokey and contrived. Doc Oc even repents his evil ways and saves the day at the end. Weak.   All in all, I gave it a 1.5/5.0. And that's being generous. Hopefully, soon, the movie industry will get over its obsession with comic books. But it won't stop with Spiderman 2 -- oh no... Harry Osbourne found his father's Green Goblin equipment stash behind "the mirror". Those of you who know the comicknow what happens next, and those of you expecting these horrible comic book movies to stop will have to suffer at LEAST another one.      Seriously, America, get some TASTE. Just because Ebert and Roper's review of Spiderman 2, brought to you by Spiderman 2 and Sprite, says the movie is great doesn't mean it is. I saw it for free, and honestly, I feel I was ripped off. Don't see Spiderman 2. Don't see Spiderman 3. Don't see any more comic book movies. Maybe then, once they've stopped making obscene amounts of money off of these crappy movies, thefilm industry will go out and hire some TALENT and make a good movie or two.
