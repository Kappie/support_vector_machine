I suppose the ending was spoiled earlier by other people, but it was still good. I can see how people make a connection to 6th Sense and talk about how they saw the ghost thing a bit earlier. Something I'm a little unsure about is why Nicole Kidman's character killed the kids. Was it because her husband died in the war and she went nuts?  Anyway... going back to that someone I never thought I'd talk to again... I'm not sure how I feel about it. I felt like I had to make first contact, because well I might have to work under her. I guess I had to show something... but I think things will still be awkward. There's no escaping that I think. I feel awkward just thinking about it.  I'm just totally lacking energy today. It's almost 11 and I just want to lay down and go to bed. I should get shit done though... we'll see.  **
