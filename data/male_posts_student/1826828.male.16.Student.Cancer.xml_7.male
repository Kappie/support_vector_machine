Work is still fun, getting a little interesting, i.e. music coursework. I am totally incapable of composing; really. My GCSE mocks went well, I won't say how well, apart from french. my worst, a shittie C. I'm so depressed, but then who the hell would actually want to go to france anyway - not me, I cannot stand the language (although some parts of France are ok). Regardless of this my favorite city is Prague, for several reasons. Oh God, i'm rambling! save me!
