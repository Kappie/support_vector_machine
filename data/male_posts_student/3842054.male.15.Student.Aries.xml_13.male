Its so funny... they make is so dramatic but its so random and the way he treats these people... oh god he's hilarious.   So lets jump into the day. Katies house. Swimming. Home. Babysitting. Parents come home. Go eat dinner. Pick Up Car. Go driving. All - Star Game. I love the 90's. The Assistant. Sportscenter. Typing. Day.  Ok... boring day... you dont care... lets talk about lyrics...   Hands Down Dashboard Confessional  Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep, this air is blessed, you share with me. This night is wild, so calm and dull, these hearts they race, from self control. Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  The words are hushed lets not get busted; just lay entwined here, undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear... so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and I let you in. And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it, that you meant it, and I knew, that you meant it, that you meant it.   I think what this song is trying to say is about a guy who is with a girl. Explanation of the year. And the guy is conciencious about whether or not this girl really loves her. He obviously is in love, entranced in her, as he feels that even her simple kiss could kill him. He is still worried about whether or not she will abuse him by ripping out his heart, or she could genuinly love him. At the end, he talks about another night when he meets up with her. He jumps over hte gate, bangs on the door, shes opens it, they kiss, he was reasurred that she loved him. END SCENE.   Theres my analysis of the song that i made in 4 minutes... have a good night everybody.
