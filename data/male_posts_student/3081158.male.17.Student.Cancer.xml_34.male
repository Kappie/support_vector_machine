"We were playing soccer when Israeli tanks ... started firing inside the camp and toward us," said Bashir Abu Jlidan, 18, a resident of Rafah refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip.   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   HONG KONG ( urlLink Reuters ) - Hundreds of thousands of people in white shirts poured onto the streets of Hong Kong on Thursday to challenge Beijing's refusal to allow them to elect their own leaders and to vent their frustration at Chinese rule.  Old people joined mothers carrying children in chanting "Return power to the people, fight for democracy" as they streamed for kilometers (miles) from a park to government offices in the heart of the city, waving green and black banners and carrying umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun.  Hundreds were treated for heat exhaustion as temperatures soared to 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit).  "I am here to tell Beijing that we want democracy, we want to elect our own chief executive," said construction worker Chan Sum Kee, 54, who like many others was protesting for the first time.  The demonstration, on the seventh anniversary of the former British colony's return to China, gave Beijing a taste of what it fears most, a mass show of public dissent.  But pro-democracy activists were quick to stress that what Hong Kong people wanted was more freedom under Chinese rule.  "We are here today to fight for democracy," said veteran campaigner Martin Lee. "Not a single person here wants independence."   Protest is beautiful:      Keep in mind that all these people showed up in really hot and humid weather for the protest.   Note: the Chinese government is up to some  urlLink dirty tricks  to stifle dissent. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ The Economist has a good article that explains a lot about the prisoner ordeal at Guantanamo. I knew that the prisoners' rights tohabeass corpus had to do with some international treaties and stuff, but I didn't realize how much the US was pwn3dz0r3d. See, they thought the  Eisentrager  ruling gave them "limitless rights in handling foreign prisoners without interference from American courts," but that was only when the prisoners were given the charges to be filed against them. The people in Guantanamo hadn't been told what they were being charged of. So, the Supreme Court "rejected the Bush administrationÂs attempt to use the base to keep the men in a legal black hole. Guantanamo Bay, while leased to America in perpetuity, remains formally Cuban territory. But the court ruled that America is in effective control of the enclave, and that federal courts therefore have jurisdiction. Now, the detainees will be able to petition for habeas corpus, the right to be brought before a court to determine whether they have been lawfully detained." So, the prisoners are going to court and it's going to totally embarrass the administration, especially considering that a lot of the prisoners are from countries the US isn't at war with right now. That's what happens when you try to fuck with people's rights.   However, the court decisions didn't decide declare the guilt or innocence of the prisoners and only released them. Also, they "left open the possibility that American citizens could still be detained without full trials, perhaps being processed instead by military tribunals," which violates the Bill of Rights as far as I can tell.  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  An Israeli helicopter fired 4 missiles at a Palistinian media building. Apparently the Israeli army hasn't done anything to prevent injuring journalists as "at least 10 journalists have been killed by Israeli troops since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in late August 2000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Information."- urlLink Aljazeera
