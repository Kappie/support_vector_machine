The winner, with any ado, was:  urlLink Varun Vasudevan (X-B)   Since Gursartaj has already detailed on the topic, I shall say not much. There were two Preliminary Rounds and one Final Round. A few Class X Exun Members also took part, but they weren't much good at gaming, to be honest. Hence the need for these competitions.  --Karan
