The blame doesn’t fall on beckham and vassell penalty miss, eriksson tactic, or rooney injury.. But it falls on the referee Urs Meier.. And yes, this ref is from Swiss and throughout the game, he had been siding the home side that is Portugal.. Really pissed of while watching.. There is contrasting feeling when watching the game.. After Owen score the opening goal jus after 3 min.. I was like so happy,whahaha.. Then for the next 80 min of the game.. It was so nervous as Portugal had been throwing the entire attacking player onto the field and England was surely on the backfoot.. But they did hold on until this very moment when this stupid idiot SIMAO SABRASO who cross the ball for HELDER POSTIGA
