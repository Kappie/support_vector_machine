Went to school didn't know that the whole graduating classes have to take photos! :P I really sucks in taking photos man.. We take the class photo and individual ones.. I'll update the photo when I got it k? So ya'll get to see it.. Hehe!! Well.. Stayed back after school for Physics practical.. And then I straight away headed for DT after that with Rayner.. Nashir cought up after some times.. Get to touch up on my artefact... I'll finish it by Thursday.. If I manage to concentrate on it the whole day that is.. Hahaha! Anyway... Nothing much happen today.. We whack some balls on each other during recess.. Soccer ball that is.. *SiGhZz*! Well.. Not much today.. Maybe tomorrow.. Haha!! Hope the photos will develop into a good one.. Cheryl.. She kept on smiling at me.. I think she likes me... Even though it's early.. I, myself, don't know.. Whether she likes me or not.. Hehehe!   PEACE OUT!!
