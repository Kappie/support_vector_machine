I woke up at like 5, then got back home  at around 10, then went to sleep until around 12.  Then i get a call from jones, saying where doing shit today, but i have no idea whats going to happen.  Um, what else, what else....O YEA! juss before he left, my dad ended up telling me he had a .357 Magnum this whole time....i was like, DAMNIT! and he was like "yea"....so, yea.  Um, nothing else to say.  I might not come home tonight, and may have  LAN party tomarrow, and, ya, thats about it, i have no idea whats going on with the antioch crew, but we'll see what happens.
