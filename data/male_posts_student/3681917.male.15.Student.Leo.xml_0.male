But anyways I spent half the day over at Ashley's house...man her mother was acting so wierd. Normally she acts like she wants to kill me but today she offered a slice of pizza.....it was SOOO wierd!  i am still working on my nusuni.com page layout...actually I probly wont work on it until i get a new computer. If imac g5's come out on monday (or even 1.5 ghz g4) and if they are shipping now I might pick one up! Elseif (you can tell im a programmer :D) I am going to get a emac g4 with a minivga to vga adapter (gonna dual monitor :D) and get an extra 512 megs of ram off crucial! Its gonna be my baby :D (Ashley..i dont mean it that way... i still love u!)
