I spent a good portion of my past evening sitting in my apartment (which has no furniture) listening to  urlLink Chicago’s Greatest Hits (1982-1989)  reminiscing how I was a fool for leaving girlfriends from middle school (which, incidentally I never had) while the following lyrics played in the background:  What kind of man would I be, living a life without any meaning.  And I know you could surely survive without me but if I had to live without you, tell me what kind of man would I be.   The good news is that my furniture is supposed to be delivered by this Friday.  The bad news is that all my ex-girlfriends have married rich men and now probably make fun of me.  I guess that’s just part of every man’s life though.  I think being forced to live off the floor of one’s apartment is conducive for depression.  I’m not really depressed, but the following lyrics ringing in my ears brings me down:  You’re the meaning in my life, you’re the inspiration.  You bring feeling to my life.  You’re the inspiration.  I wanna have you near me.  I wanna have you hear me it.  No one needs you more than I need you.   The obvious solution would be to turn Chicago off and destroy the CD.  True.  Still, there is that satisfaction in feeling crappy that often comes with self-pity.  Plus, I don’t have much around me to cheer me up anyway.  I think I’d rather kick myself for letting all those now seemingly flawless girls get away than put on the Counting Crows and feel better.   Being without you takes a lot getting used to.  I should learn to live with it.  But I don’t want to.  Being without you is all a big mistake.  Instead of getting any easier, it’s the hardest thing to take.  I’m addicted to you, baby.  You’re a hard habit to break.
