Saner Gov't and Politics? Si Bush!?! Babes? Bakit, wala ba ritong mga sanggol?  *sigh* I'm really in an insane mood tonight. Ang hirap mag-isip ng good thoughts.  Anyway, Debb, I salute your love for the Philippines kahit na I cannot understand it myself. I'm not saying that I love US or any other country more pero with all this, love your country and such, I don't really know where to place myself. I'm thinking kasi that with all that, we're more or less promoting bias because we're putting ourselves above others. We're saying we're better or stonger or more this or more that. So we're belittling other cultures and thinking we're above them na. We're all simply human, aren't we? Just a thought. It probably has nothing to do with what you mean.  Puwedeng 200 question lang? Pero mas madali kung 20 questions lang. Honga pala, who will start it? Si Jer na lang kasi siya naman nag-suggest, eh!
