So far, I have either done insane amounts of yardwork, watched TV for hours on end, tried to endure my annoying cousins, or spaced out while playing my guitar.  What a great way to start my spring break.  Look at this, it's already Thursday!!  Yippee!  I am going to see The Whole Ten Yards on Friday, that will be cool, followed by this "Mystery Activity" Brionna has planned for the group, and she refuses to tell me what it is (You're TEARING ME APAAAAART!!).  Oh, I did go and hike Beacon Rock with the group, alas, Alicia and her asthma slowed us down, so we went over to her house and watched some movies.  Win Win, I think.  -  I have started to write my script for that updated Julius Caesor idea I had.  It's going pretty well.  Kinda hard to get anything done on this, because I go all psycho into the details of the settings and camera work, so I estimate a total of four years to get this done.  -  As the world does turn, And if London burns, I'll be standing on the beach, with my guitar. I wanna be in a band, When I get to Heaven. Anyone can play guitar, And they won't be a nothing, anymore.  -  I don't know why, but the '96 version of Romeo and Juliet is one of my favourite movies, up there with Pulp Fiction and Fight Club.  Funny.  -  I don't know, I'm kinda at a loss on the subject of my love interest.  I think she may already know, so I'm really not sure if I should even go for her.  I really like her, though.  -  I'm about to konk out at the desk.
