In this conservative diocese it is a relief to find an inclusive group of Episcopalians who share the same concerns, and thoughts that I do.  The group is a group of people of all walks - some are gay, some are straight.    At this meeting the Reverend Susan Russell, the president of Integrity USA came for a visit. This was my first time ever meeting, or even seeing a female priest outside of photographs and television.  It was the first Eucharist I celebrated with a female priest, who just so happens to also be a lesbian.  I was so touched by her message, and her beautiful voice.    I actually got to see first-hand what the Episcopal Church USA (ECUSA) has to offer me, as a gay Christian.  In this diocese I don't get to see the true inclusivity of the Church - supported by the Bishop and clergy.  At this meeting, and by Susan's beautiful approach to spirituality within the Episcopal Church I can really say I have seen the true message of the Inclusive Church, which is Christ's body.  I can truely say "I am an Episcopalian."  I can truely say that I know what inclusivity is.  I experienced it for the first time.  There were tears.  There was laughter.  There was a few "Amens" shouted even.  I truely felt the power of the Holy Spirit as strong as I have ever felt It before in the Episcopal Church.  At the Mass that Susan celebrated with Integrity.  At the Mass that we celebrated at Trinity Episcopal Church the next morning.  I was so moved by the Power of God Almighty that I can truely say "I know this is where I belong."  And I can shout from the highest roof-top "Jack it ain't your Church it's God's Church!"  I can truely say I experienced the spirit of Christ all around me, within me, and coming from me... And it is a beuatiful thing to be able to say.  It's a beautiful thing to be able to stand strong in Christ and know that through Him all things are possible - all things are possible through God, who is love!  I've learned more about myself, and about what I can achieve in this life... evangelism, a romance filled with Godly love and compassion, and through both I can truely feel the presance of the Holy Spirit that I have felt and hope to continue to feel working in the true Episcopal Church - the Church that embraces inclusivity, and the via media... the middle way.  Alleluia - and Glory to God in the Highest!   Under God's Mercy, I remain, Robby D.  Diocese of Fort Worth, TX
