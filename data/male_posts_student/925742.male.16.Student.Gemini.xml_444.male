The guy is real patient and friendly and stuff.  We talked about Metallica and other metal bands, and played PS2 and watched Kiss of the Dragon and talked about life and stuff.  And then we watched funny flash stuff, MGS stuff, slept, played Viewiful Joe, and the list goes on.  Yeah, we're seeing Metallica together, since he's cool.  Ok, then later today I went to school and took my law and legal test in advance.  Yeah, and then I went home and then went to work.  I'm gonna go ahead and say that this was the weirdest work day I've ever had.  I started shoveling the snow from the units and I was headed down B aisle and saw like 3 cop cars and 6 cops.  Apparently in one of the units some guy was making meth for about a week and was busted at his house.  They came here to find his lab.   And then later, I was still shoveling (what fun, eh??) and Thomas appears.  Thomas, none of you know.  He was an exchange student here two-three years ago and befriended Derek.  He's from Dresden.  ANYway, he's here to visit his sweetheart whom he may marry (aaw) and then work later this summer.  He'll be here till saturday, and it was a really nice surprise to see him!  Anyways, I am all packed for the Symposium Wednesday.  I'm ready......... aight, this is it, later guys.  Be back friday.
