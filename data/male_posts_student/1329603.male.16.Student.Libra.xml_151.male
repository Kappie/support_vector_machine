Basically, the situation I'm in is that I have 2 new, wonderful friends, both of which are really friendly, really caring, really amazing and both really good looking but we'll scrub round that one for the time being. The situation I've put myself into aside, what am I faced with? I went from not knowing the 2 of them and being miserable, to knowing the 2 of them and being happy (before I rogered myself!). Coincidence? Not very likely. They're friends that very quickly, somehow, have touched me very deeply, and both in a very positive way. I've never felt so close to anyone in such a short space of time (save Scott, but you all know how that's continuing), and then 2 people have come along at once. *_*. They're friends I can't afford to lose. If, in a couple of months, either feel like they want anything more (which is unlikely, let's face it) then... I don't know how I'll react then, but any man would be the luckiest man on Earth to have either of them. And I've got both of them as friends.  Quote of the day: "Just hold me now, and let it be.
