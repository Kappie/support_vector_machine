They need someone to rely on them, they need to feel that they have a larger pupose in life that watching television in a thong on saturday mornings. Personally, I could never have a child. I know I'm gay and so its physically impossible to have one with a man but I still don't think I would want one if I was straight. They'd get in the way of my fabulousness. Sure, they're cute and novel.....for two weeks and then I'd probably lose interest. I can't take care of plants let alone children. People think that my self obsession is just an act. Well sweety, I'm here to tell you that it ain't. I mean its only natural to be.......preoccupied with yourself. Its just that I am......to more of an extreme. So children.............no way, ew.
