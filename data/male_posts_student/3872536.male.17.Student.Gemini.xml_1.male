So wierd coz realli duno wat to write, perhaps there's too much stuff in my head liao and so duno how to go about starting ba....    Finally get to realli rest today liao. Wake up at 9+ then have lunch after which I slept till 2 lol. Juz too tired ba. Spend the whole day yesterday introducing eclub to the lower sec. students. Never know that I can actually talk in front of parents men. What a big breakthrough :p Then talk to a parent who only know how to speak Chinese (think she's a foreigner ba). It's when I realise how bad my Chnese is men. Taking so long to translate words liao entrepreneur n capital. Luckily she gets what I say.   Yeah today go about looking for mattress and exchanging n buying lights. So tired. Stressed up men, tot tml can rest but then Esmond says got the Leo June Camp meeting at 1 lor then after that still got the culture documentary meeting at 7! Haiz there goes my Monday man...  Haha thinking bout what's installed for us during the class gathering at Sentosa this Wed. Realli duno wat to do thr lor. What to expect from such a quiet guy like mi lor haha. Stressed in a sense that I might be called a wet blanket? Haiz... forget it man, no matter wat they call mi, I'm used to it liao (through training by my friends lah who's like always pin-pointing mi...)  Never know that I actually have so much to share. A good start ba. Damn tired now. Go take a rest liao. Sorry if I don't update my blog frequently coz I think I dun realli haf the time to do so....
