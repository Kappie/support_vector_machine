    
       Today is the first day of my 10 day spring break. I have no plans to do anything very exciting, but I do have a few things in mind for what I want to do with my time.  Eat food   Probably go to another threefoundonewounded show tonight   Watch movies   Sleep   I guess I should study for the ACT   Take some photos   Go see  The Passion  and  Eternal Sunshine    Eat some more food   Sleep again   Bother my brothers and sister   Maybe I'll go outside and stand around a bit   Try to finish  The Fountainhead   That's about it... Anything else you think I should do?
