I for one doesnt beleive in this view. Had she been that good as claimed, then she must have not accepted the position of the Congress Leader. Nou Mr.Singh is  urlLink promising  Reforms with Human Face. I dont understand the logic behind reforms with human face. Hou can u take away subsidies without affecting anybody?. i am comlpetely at loss.May be some economist has to clarify that.
