Knowing Ranieri, we will trust the injured players, or hopefully not as I hope to God. As sad as this looks as well, this is what I think the team will (or should) be tonight:                                                              Cudicini  Johnson                 Terry                                                       Gallas                                    Bridge         Geremi                   Parker                                                                                                  Cole                                                                                            Lampard                                 Gudjohnson                                                                                            Crespo   I think we will snatch it, but overall I'm not sure. It can be done and if we play to our maximum (like I hope and expect), we'll do it. I'm probably going to the Shed bar at Stamford Bridge and be very drunk, so I won't remember if we loose. Hoooorahhh. I also plan to call quite a few people strangely and have a wonderful drink fuelled celebration over the wireless with them. I've also decided that (as odd as this sounds also) if we win, it will be a sign, and that I should take a few more risks than I usually do on a few things. Don't know why but I've decided to stop hating myself and appreciate life and stop presuming that others will not be there for me and wouldn't take a chance with me.  Oh and revise also lol.  I was thinking last night also, how above virtually anything, football rallies the emotions. Forget life, depression et al; a game where 22 men try to kick a small synthetic ball into a rectangular goal can evoke the strongest of emotions in people. Chelsea is my only religion, and when times haven't been so good for me I've always known, however well they're doing, that I can rely on them unquestionably for some relief. This is why I love them so dearly as I do. The love I have for them is like the one you give to your children, and as over-exaggerated as this sounds, it's the only way I can describe it, and in the most truest form. xBuBzx
