The only way I find my self going to sleep is if I just lay there doing nothing, not even thinking for about an hour, and it's really hard for me to do that. My hole life is probably just based on thinking, that's all I practically do. My social life is practically gone. If it wasn't for summer school, I'd have none. Which is only a measely 2 and a half hours of my day. The rest of the time I usually spend just listening to music, playing guitar, or video games. Well that's life for me.  Today I tried talking in a british accent the whole day. It was actually pretty fun. Only lasted a couple of hours, but it was interesting stuff. Bugged the hell out of my little brother. If I only knew a little more street talk it would've been even better. I love talking in accents. One of my very limited talents. Some people think I'm stupid for doing it, but their just jealous couse they can't do it, haha. Some people do stupid stuff to get atttention from others, I do it cause I love doing it. Some people think I say random things, but it's not really random when it's triggered by something you said first. I like to turn every situation into something funny, no matter what the subject is. I hate it when the mood gets sad, I hate saddness, and I hate seeing other people sad. When people around me are in a bad mood I tend to get in a bad mood. I could be the most misserable person in the world, but still be happy if everyone else was happy. But I know something like that could never happen, It's saddly impossible. And the world would probably be pretty boring. What makes life what it is and worth living is all these trivilizations that we go through. Yeah sometimes it feels like it's hopeless, but once you get through something you feel a whole lot better. Life can't just be about "good times", It needs "bad times" too or those "good times" will just any normal thing and you'd tire of it.  Ok, I'm just rambeling about about a bunch of shit n he-ha.  One thing I'm wondering is, is anybody reading this shit. I'd like to ask anybody that reads this to just comment on it. It doesn't matter if it's about anything. I'd just like to see if people actually read what I'm saying here.
