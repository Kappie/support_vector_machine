Well worth the read. He brings in some elements of social thinking and cognitive early development that actually put some credibility back into the frog's argument.   It's still an over-analyzed, cultural reactionary diatribe - but at least, from a cognitive standpoint (an argument which he doesn't make, btw, it just happens to be a related point through coincidental research compoletely unrelated to his rantings), he can get some traction. Not much, but a little.
