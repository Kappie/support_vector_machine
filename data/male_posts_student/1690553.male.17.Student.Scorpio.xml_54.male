Not an orientation program but more like a family day, but with Islamic input. Totally unique IIUM style. This time it involves three Kulliyahs (Faculties) - Kulliyah of Medicine, Pharmacy and Allied Health Sciences. It started yesterday afternoon with registration and lunch. Then at 3pm the Oficiating Ceremony by Prof. Dato' Dr. Md. Tahir Azhar, Dean of Kulliyyah of Medicine followed by Tazkirah by Ustaz Hamidon, Director of Sultan Ahmad Shah Mosque, IIUM Gombak. Only then they have their group picture.     One Big Happy IIUM Kuantan Family      Ustaz Hamidon giving his tazkirah   The hotel was nice, unique styling with one huge atrium. The roof styling actually resembles the traditional Malay house, and I think it is awfuly similiar with the one found at Kulliyah of Architecture and Enviromental Design (KAED) Building in Gombak campus. The program was great, in fact IIUM Family Day had never disappointed me. No nonsense stuffs, no karaoke, just pure fun and educating family day and getting to know each other better. For me, that's the way family day should be. We also had Qiamullail early this morning but I didn't go - not feeling very well.     Shortly after coming back home from Awana Kijal at 10am I went to the neighbourhood surau to help them to do some spring cleaning to prepare for Ramadhan. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I came a little bit late so there's little work to do.     Resting after cleaning up   - Sound of  Keluarga Bahagia  by  Saujana  -
