Richard then says he knows a perfect way to do so, and half of it has already been done. Ioli stares in suspense, asking Richard, “What exactly have you done?”  In the Giddeon home, there is a knock at Jacquelines door. As she throws a towel on she goes to answer it. To her surprise it’s Ernesto at the door. She asks, what the hell he wants, and he says he isn’t leaving without Daniel, her son. She protests that she is going to call the police and charge him for trespassing and harassment. Ernesto then slaps Jacqueline and tells her never to speak to him that way again.
