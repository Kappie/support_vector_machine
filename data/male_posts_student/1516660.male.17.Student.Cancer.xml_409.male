Chem Bonding to me, is still half bucketful of water. I can't grasp the idea well! Sigh.  Heh. I was forbidden to scare Gloria. Sigh. What to do? I tried to give her a mild scare, but it didn't work. Meow!! Sigh. We were almost late. Even ducks are mooing and meowing.  Sigh. The Chem MCQ is a horror! Ayioh! For 1/3 of the paper, I was wildly making guesses! I swear, I never guessed so much in my entire life! Ayioh! I barely have enough time for the paper! Sigh... How meowing.  Paper 2 ar. At first I was doing quite happily. Then, qi shi wor!! The back questions were tough, and then I only have time for 1.5 essays questions, and I am supposed to do 3. Sigh. Fail le la! Fail le la!  Okay. Depressing business aside. We went home after the exam. Too tired to do anything else. Sigh. Tomorrow also dunnoe do what somemore. Meow. I think I end this entry le la. See ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!
