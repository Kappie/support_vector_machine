Aside from hearing Sedaris on NPR, the only other book of his I have read is Me Talk Pretty One Day, which I enjoyed immensely.    Overall he is very skilled at telling a story with his style being clean, neat, and crisp.  One is able to breeze through his books quickly because they are an assortment of light and humorous essays.  But I also feel as if this type of presentation is a limitation of the author as I find myself loosing interest towards the end of each essay as the story grows stale.  There are also parts in the book where he leaps from humor to a more serious and formal tone, but doesn't quite make the transition work.  David Sedaris has a great talent for cocktail party anecdotes, but he could never master a full novel.  Parts of the book also seem to be written not for their humor, but of quite praise for his family members with a scent of hope for forgiveness in using them in previous writings.  That being said, I am still a fan.  His humor is biting and at several places in the book I laughed out loud.  He is able to take an typical happening and deliver in such a way that makes it completely unique.  He knows where his powers lay in writing and he leans on them with great success.     I give this book 3 stars out of 5 as only 3/5 of the book is worth reading.  It's a good read all the way through, but perhaps if he had waited to publish he could have weeded out the less humorous stories for better ones.
