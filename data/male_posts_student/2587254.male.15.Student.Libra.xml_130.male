The rest was awesome =P.  -History: My Mark dropped from 93-86. Dunno how. -Civics: Bombed my exam *I think sadly* -Lunch: Went to Jasper's. Had some really spicy quesadilla thing with beef -Math: Totally bombed test -Programming: Meh.  After that day of school, went home for a bit, and then Stars of the Festival, where our band didn't do amazing, but we sounded decent. I left after first half....gotta study for science test which I was doing.
