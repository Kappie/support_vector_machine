This happend two days ahead of schedual, as it was suppose to be done on June 30th. But because of gorilla's with thier recent insurgences and promised insurgences to stop the handover of power on June 30th, the US in secret handed over power today. After our year and a half "war" with the stupid country thank god it's over. Now, don't get me wrong, I am paterotic and all, but going to war with Saddam Hussein was the stupidest descion ever. Well, I guess that's what we get when we have a President in office the country did not want. Yeah, that's right, the country did not want Bush as a president. And we are losing our countries money, supplies, and most importantly our military over his stupid little greediness to finish the job his dad started as President. We have pictures of us Americans, and other nationalitys being beheaded over in Iraq and other Arab countries because of this war. Car bombs are a daily occurance, sometimes an hourly occurance, and again most are because of our presence in the Arab countries. Now Saddam Hussein was not a nice man at all, he did some horrible things. But so have other people. Castro in Cuba isn't the nicest man, and you don't see us going after him. Everything Bush backed his war up on was proven wrong. We didn't find any chemical weapons and Hussein did not help with 9/11. So what was the reason we went after him? Well Bush was greedy and wanted oil, and again to finish his dad's job. So he sent our military over there, one was my good friends dad, who had to leave while his wife was pregnat, so he couldn't help there, and missed everything of my friends 8th grade year, from may crowning, to graduation all because he was sent over to some country to help with the war. He wasn't even in Iraq. But then there are the thousands that lost their life. And all to get to this day. The Iraq people are now in charge, but did you know, that over half the American population think Iraq will be another dictaorship in less than 5 years? What are all the families who lost thier love ones going to think in 5 years when they know the war was pointless? It's going to be horrible for them. Iraq is in a horrible state right now as proven because they had to move the handover up insecret just becuase of it. We can't force our government upon someone else. The people they interview on the news who say they love americans are a very little minority over there. The news is bias. Any intelligant person should know that. But most people don't want anything American, including democracy. They want us away from them and as far as away as possible. So really today marked a day that should of never happened. And we'll all soon see that. How stupid our President was. The President we didn't want. The President that screwed us over.
