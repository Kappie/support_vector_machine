Drinks are on me.  Sarcasm aside, I feel this will be an interesting experience. It's hard to pinpoint my reasons for choosing to publishing my deepest, most personal thoughts only for the world to see. The man living in my right auditory canal, but we'll leave that subject alone for the time being. No, let's focus on a couple succinct, less personal reasons:  1) Being a self-professed geek and technophile, I figure I should have some semblance of a web site, lest my PDA reject my body and eat its way through my pocket, thereby ruining a perfectly good pair of pants. In my history online, I have started exactly three personal web sites, and have finished exactly zero. Let us pray this one will live long enough to catch interest in online communities, making yours truly an Internet sensation overnight. One can dream.  2) A few of my good friends, both online and in that frightening void know as the Real World, have similar online journals. I have yet to come across a trend more worthy of my endorsement.  3) My mind is a raging sea of useless knowledge and half-finished thoughts. Hear that gurgling sound? Could just be the three-day-old leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken using my stomach as a medium to communicate with the living world, but let's not go there. Anyway, I feel I should have a place to write down some of the things that spew forth from my cerebral cortex on an hourly basis.  4) Being at the height of my teenage years, I feel it may be time to indulge in a little navel-gazing and soul-searching. Therefore, during the lifespan of this blog, I will successfully deduce no less than the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You can take my word for it.  Having seen this, I'm guessing that this blog will end up being some odd combination of  urlLink Slashdot  and  The Catcher in the Rye . Nevertheless, a good time will be had by all. I hope I will be able to find the time to stop by and update regularly.  I can see that nearly an hour has passed since I started this composition. The Internet and instant messaging services are indeed powerful forces of distraction. And unwatched episodes of  24  are calling. 'Night.
