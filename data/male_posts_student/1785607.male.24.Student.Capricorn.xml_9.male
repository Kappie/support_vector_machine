Reading mine, I see that I'm not different than the rest. Yes, I tend to put something different now and then, but as a rule, when I didn't have a relationship I was complaining about the ones my friends had or the one I didn't have and just growing bitter remembering the one that matter to me. In the inter between meeting my guy and having the real and actual relationship, I just have the tendency to be scared, emotional, sometimes frustrated and insecure... Now, that I have one, is all the same, plus jealousy.  Sometimes, reading and remembering what I felt at the moment of the post, I feel like the third world answer to Carrie Bradshaw... Too bad that my not-column doesn't have all those readers... I could be a hit. LOL!    ... It was cathartic ( just hope this is the way the word is written ). Thinking it, writing it, reading it and saying it. I am a jealous person. What am I jealous of? I don't know, I just am. Believe me though, when I said and wrote that word yesterday, a BIG weight was lifted of my chest. I feel so good now. So in peace. So secure. I can move on now, and grow on what I want this to be.   ... See, I tend to make everything about me and my drama...!!! Fuck why not? Is my blog... If I want to read about someone else's drama I'd read another blog...
