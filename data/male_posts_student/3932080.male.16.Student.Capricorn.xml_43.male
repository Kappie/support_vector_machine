Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.    urlLink Turn Me On -Kevin Lyttle (feat. Spragga Benz) Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #9 It’s hard not to feel bad for Kevin Lyttle, who was endowed with the voice of a helium intake and stuck with such lines as “hug me, hug me, kiss me, squeeze me” throughout “Turn Me On,” the lead single from his eponymous debut. The music doesn’t really help his case, sounding like a soccer jock jam mixed with some clichéd reggae synth, ultimately more 80s than anything else on summer radio during 2004. Oh yeah, as if the guy didn’t have enough to worry about, he has a terribly foreshadowing surname.    The Verdict:  5.2/10-  Brouhaha   (2.6/5)
