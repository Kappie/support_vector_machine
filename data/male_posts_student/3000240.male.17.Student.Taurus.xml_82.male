Anyway, I had a dream last night, I guess well because of what I was talking about with Justine after Troy about her life being one big mess until she found Jesus. I said fair enough and that it was good for her to vent her emotions at something if it meant that her mental well-being would remain sound, because I know If I went through what she went through, well from what I can vaguely anticipate, I doubt my brain could stomach it and just carry on as usual, and this is coming from a social fuck-up who's achieved more mistakes than is countable. I also guess that that's why I want to be part of her life, to understand these things and just to share and un-repress some things lurking around in the deepest unconscious, in both her and me. She's also really fun to be with as far, funny, un-repetitive and spontaneous (something which I adore in magnitude).  I'm still though trying to get my head around Troy. Was it good or bad I'm not sure. Usually after films I can tell straight of whether it was worth the ÃÂ£5 or not, but I'm swaying towards a thumbs up at the moment, my only concern was that Brad Pitt was cast wrong, maybe an actor with more of a prescence would have been suitable, although you can't really fault his effort in it all, he played it to his best ability and fair enough to him. Orlando Bloom was cast so so but also played it well and as for the rest of the actors/actresses (eg Helen of Troy), they all played it superbly. The only reason I'm undecided about the film is the start and the length of it all. At 2 3/4 hours, It's alot to take in at one go and a 2nd viewing wouldn't go a miss. The start seemed to have a lack of a background somewhat with the ideas of Hericles being this awesome fantastico warrior man dude, just coming straight into it like a newcome dictator without much history explained to you, and it was evident on many other features about the film. Oh well maybe I think about this stuff too much, but not really a bad effort on the part of the film-makers. Ciao for now. xBuBzx
