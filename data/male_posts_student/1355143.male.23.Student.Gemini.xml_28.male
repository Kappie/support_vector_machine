My new years was pretty good I spent the begining of the evening with my family but after midnight I went to another town close by (an hour driving) where my best friend lives, we started drinking at his place and then moved on to one of his friends where there were alot of young but pretty girls, which I consider to be a good thing. I kissed to many girls in my opinion but who gets enough of kissing? The night ended on a couch at my friends place and I wasnt alone;)  The day after we went to see Lord of the Rings in a VIP room (if you dont know what that is then its like a regular movie theater where you pay double the entrance but sit in a Lazy Boy and get all the pop corn and all the coke you can drink). I definatly think the VIP thing was worth it coz the movie is almost 4 hours, we went at midnight and came out short before 4.   On Saturday I went to my cousins wedding and I had the job of being her photographer which is harder than it sounds for example I was trying to take a picture of the wedding waltz I took like 7 pictures but all I got was their backs ( the camera is rather slow).  Later me and some of my cousins went down town where I got phone numbers of two girls one I realy like but the number of the other one Im gonna lose. Actually I just came few hours ago from our first date it was pretty nice but I dont know if it will work out.   Thats enough of my life, Ingi/Ãšlli
