Is this all I'll ever be? How can I go on, how do I go on? The world bleeds and so do those who live upon it. This spiral that cannot be broken, the path to death and the everlasting darkness. To redemtion? It hardly seems likely. Does the afterlife truly exsist or is it just one more lie in a sea of many. To many, far to many. Life, life is a lie. Pretending to be that which it is not. Not happy and warm yet neither cool and sad. Can any understand the meaning of it all? I doubt it. How can one understand that which has no meaning? But if it did would we realise it? Maybe it does. Or maybe not, it doesn't matter. It's pointless like everything else. Pointless as my exsistence. Making me feel small. Because when you get down to it I don't matter. My name will fade as will my memories. Fade and burn like so many before. Call it fate, call it destiny, call it what you will it is the same. Same as you and same as me. We are the same. We share life yet we are seperate. Broken as everything I know and everything I will ever know. Shards of what I think tinkling down like a broken window. That window is me, my exsistence. It's all I've got really. My most prized posession and my curse. Without it there would be no pain. But even the simple hurt of pain can feel good, just knowing you're still there, still alive. It helps to focuse you yet can suck at your soul like a drug. What soul? I don't have one. I never have and never will. You have to believe to have a soul. I don't, I can't. It's easier just to wallow in my self pity. I'm evil but is evil so bad? You have to have evil to have good. They balance, they lend meaning to their opposite. Without one the other doesn't exsist. And neither does. I confuse myself. I don't know why though. Maybe because I'm me. No man can understand himself in all forms. No man can understand another. I hurt when I try to think of that. It boggles me how this all works. Everything that is. It all fits. It's broken but it still works. It wouldn't work if it was fixed. Because then it would be broken even worse than it is now. We need it. So my big question is why? Why why why why? It doesn't have to be like this does it? And if it does then how come? And if so then why can't it be better? So what's better? Nothing and everything. Nothing is always better than everything though. Why nothing? Why not something else? Have you every experienced nothing? Yes. I feel nothing now. I am empty like a deflated balloon. That's what is better. Better than you and better than me. It feels good. Like I'm stoned but I'm not. I feel clean. Anything is better than what I was before. Before what? Before life, before exsistence. Merely being alive screws you up. It's unavoidable, bearing down on you full of troubles. Burning like a hound from hell. Only worse because hell only tortures you physically. And that's just pain, just like any other. This is deep down, far into the soul I don't have. Imagine the worst pain possible and multiply it by infinity. That's what it feels like. Can you imagine that? Yes you probably can. Because you can feel it to. Everyone can, living and dead. Everyone hurts in their own way. Everyone hurts in one way or another.  Reality Sucks,  -Dant
