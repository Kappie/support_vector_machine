I will be starting Chubb in September and will take the Network Security course.  That will run for 13 months.  Hopefully after that I can get a job in the field and live my life. (if there is no draft :-X) We will just have to wait and see, that's all.  Today was rather crappy.  We did nothing in gym but sat outside because of the temperature... It was about 94 with a heat index of 100.  We sat around in shop because we already completed our work.  So not too much of a school day.
