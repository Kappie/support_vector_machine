As you all know I left the sun and have come back to the land of rain and clouds last Friday, and returned with a storming hangover which was a must!  Nothing big on the last night, but a couple of spliffs in the ghetto (Raval), near La Paloma (we were gonna go there but the music sounded menacing on our way in so we turned around and got the hell out of there!)  I had a 21st bday on the Saturday and dutifully turned up and got suitably off my face ;op  if you ever invite me to a party with free booze you can always rely on my to get suitably smashed!  Anywho, I hope that my presence was appreciated and one day when I get some time I will put all the photos I took on Walker's website.  I have been saying this for quite some time now so when it actually happens there is gonna be a shed load of new photos on there so ch-ch-check it out!  After this final night of fun and frolics I actually started work on the Monday, my internship with UBS.  Guess what, rude awakening!  I had to be there at 8 in the morning, now this doesn't sound too bad until you realise that it takes me about an hour and a half to travel into work!  That means that I had to get the first, yes the FIRST, train into town at just before half six.  I am sure everyone agrees that we are more used to getting home at this time rather than leaving home!  So far, the week has just been training, imagine being back at school with a couple of "fun" teambuilding activities thrown in.  The kind involving coloured hats and treasure hunts etc...  It has been refreshing to actually be doing something with my days, unlike the days at the beach or in the flat sleeping off the alcohol....  I "hit" my desk on Tuesday which is what I am really looking forward to as then I will actually find out what I am gonna be doing for the next ten weeks, up to this moment I still don't really know whats gonna happen....though I do know that we have our first social tonight with money behind the bar so I will have to be very careful to control myself and not end up puking outside the bar!  Fingers crossed....  I hope Tim's arse kicking email persuades a few more people to join our "community" but we will have to wait and see.  I am gonna return to working my arse off and will check y'all later.  Be good,  A
