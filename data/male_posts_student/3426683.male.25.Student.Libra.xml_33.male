This one's simply ridiculous and wicked unfair: "Red Sox GM Theo Epstein came to Atlanta yesterday and suddenly all was right with the Sox. Nomar Garciaparra had three more hits, including a homer (so did the offday make all the difference or would one of those hits have won the game Thursday?), Curt Schilling fired a complete game, the brilliant Terry Francona knew enough to put Doug Mirabelli (grand slam) into the lineup, and the Sox snapped a four-game losing streak with a 6-1 win over the Braves."  Ignoring the swipe at Nomar, the crack on Francona's pretty unwarranted, too.  jugwine and jerseygirl, over at  urlLink Sportsfilter.com ,  urlLink say it better than I could :   jugwine : "Lesson #1 of Boston Media: Dan Shaughnessy makes his money off of exploiting the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. It is therefore safe to completely ignore anything he has to say regarding it. In fact, it's better to just ignore him completely because he's nothing more than a  urlLink clown ."   jerseygirl : "First, it's Shaughnessy. He makes a living exploiting the fears and anger of Red Sox Nation and some of that is by way of the NY Boston rivalry. If he's not throwing out a hypothetical about 'The Yankees are going to sign Pedro/Nomar!' then it's 'We have a right to be angry about (insert minute issue here).' It took me a little while to understand why everyone in town hates him.  "Let me give you all an idea of how Shank operates. Within the last few months, he wrote an article wherein he spoke of himself as an owner of the Boston Red Sox. Shaughnessy works for the Globe. The Globe is owned by the NY Times. The Times has a small percentage ownership of the Boston Red Sox. He somehow deduced that he was a team owner. Someone on a message board pointed it out, so I checked it out. It was one of the most obnoxious self-indulgent articles I had read in a long time.  "If Shaughnessy isn't bitching about Manny, he's bitching about Pedro, and before that he was bitching about Carl Everett. Actually, for those who aren't in Boston, Carl Everett and Shaughnessy were mortal enemies. Carl Everett once called Shaughnessy a 'Curly Haired Boyfriend.' Funny stuff."  In other words, this article's pretty much par for the course.
