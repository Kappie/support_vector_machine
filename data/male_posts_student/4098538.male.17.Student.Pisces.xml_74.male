We went to town on the Wednesday and Mandy decided to buy me some hair dye out of the blue, so yeah, I dyed my hair other night, hoping it would turn out the usual colour it does (which is a nice shade of red) but it actually came out purple this time, but sometimes it looks black. I don't really like it. We also saw Shrek 2. It's so damn funny. I won't write about any of it incase you haven't seen it yet, but I do reccomend it =) Also, Mandy got some new shoes. Again. What is with Mandy and shoes? If she sees shoes that are under Â£20, she'll have them. She has about 5 pairs that all look so similar. But I must admit, the design on the bottom of Wednesday's pair was funkeh. Makes her happy so I won't complain anymore! Hmmm, I got a really bad headache earlier. I've been having a lot of them lately. I dunno why but I ain't liking them! Oh yeah, my birdy died today =( after 26 months of being owned by me! Ah well. I don't think I'll get another, because they're loud bastards and they shit all over your room. But... I dunno, I might. If I get a super young one, I could teach it to talk! Who knows? Well it's 4.20am right now and I've spent the night doing lots of downloading. Sad, I know. But me likes music! My mum just come in and she is hammered. She's been at her bosses place... hmmmm...
