Pardon my French but I'm distraught.  I'd always thought of us as something special. Incompetent I am not. I'm sure everyone else thinks they've got something special going on. What's obvious is obvious. Now, some of the normal people are having it better than I. We've become strangers. Mere acquaintances. I'm living with memories. Hi and bye on the street. I didn't want it to end like this. I didn't want it to end.  The more I think about it, the more of a fuck-up I believe I am. I did screw up big time, many times. She was perfect. I choose to believe that she is still faultless. I know nobody isn't. Nobody but her. Ramblings of a mind abused with tears. I would like to write it all down. I'm afraid that if I do, that would be my last art. I don't own much. There isn't much to give away.  I'm seriously considering my options.
