Endurance is best developed thru cardio exercises for periodically extending periods of time. Flexibility is maintained most effectively when performed during or after exercise, when blood is flowing thru the body and the muscles are more elastic. Technique is the most important aspect of one's fitness regimen, consistency is second, attitude is third.
