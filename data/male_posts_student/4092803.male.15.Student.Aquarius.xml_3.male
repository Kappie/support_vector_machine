SAVE AGAINST DISEASE WITH A  2 PENICILLIN BONUS!      "Bob, I just remembered I forgot to take my birth control!"  .. REFLEX THROW With *uugh*  -3 to save!      "Bob, I think I'm pregnant."  .. ROLL D20 TO HIT WITH LEAD PIPE! Wilderness check to conceal body!      Sorry folks, you prolly wwon't get any of this if yu don't play Dungeons and Dragons or some other d20 game like Modern XD but, hey, it sure as hell was fun for me!         LESSON TIME!:   Oh, and, so you know, there's I believe 6 official die used in d20   d4 - A traingular pyramid      d6 - A cube      d8 - An polyhedron with 8 sides      d10 - A polyhedron with 10 sides      d12 - A polyhedron with 12 sides      d20 - a polyhedron with 20 sides     d20 is mostly used for saving throws and and to hit, the others are usually used for damage and spell duration time, things like that.        W00t, because, I have not said that in bloody fucking forever    - Teh Bret O_o;  Always willing to spew useless information
