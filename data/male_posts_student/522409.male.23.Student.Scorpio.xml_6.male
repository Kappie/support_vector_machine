IMHO  ugh.  i hate sour grapes, and i hate being the guy who runs around crying foul after a competition, but damn.  talk about dropping the ball, judges.  then i came home, kinda disappointed, and found myself flipping through hotornot.com.  two hours later, i still found myself flipping through that damn page clicking 1-10 ratings for people i didn't even know... and i'm not sure at that point i was even looking at the pictures.  tragic.  melody, i missed you last night, dear.  thank you for checking in from girls' night.  made my night :)  i woke up this morning and i'm fairly certain my fears have been realized: i have strep.  yep.  i do.  i woke up sounding like joan rivers after a carton of newports, and realizing i had to be at the studio today.  or did i?  i checked the session note in my email and as of wednesday, there was no session scheduled for sunday.  ::crosses fingers::  he said stay tuned for an update, but an update never came.  called the studio manager's cell- no answer.  called the studio manager's office- no answer.  called studio a- tyler, the other intern answers.  tells me no worries, he's got the fort held down and will be heading home soon.  what a beautiful sunday.  i'm serious.  it's a beautiful day in boston.  maybe i'll go out today... the fresh air would do me good.  still waiting on the results from icca's quarterfinal in buffalo.  i have a couple friends in the buffalo chips, and rellz and i have been anxiously awaiting the results, which were handed down over 12 hours ago.  why don't we know?  iiiiii dunno.  that's all for now.  i've done nothing interesting and thus have little of interest to say.  but it sure was fun talking at you. :)
