It was awesome .. we both slept very well (except for a few minutes when we kinda both woke up a little horny and rubbed each other down [ok yeah if this is too much for you then don't read my blog :-P ]).  Before we went to bed there was a thunderstorm.  I LOVE thunderstorms and as it turns out so does David.  We stripped to our boxers and went out into the rain and lightning to see the storm.  We stood there just holding each other close (trying not to freeze) getting soaked and enjoying the moment and being together and life in general.  I was almost magical.  Then we both started to get hypothermia (lol well not really but it was freaking cold).  So we came inside and went to take a shower to get warmed up.  When we were laying in bed he started to open up to me a little more and tell me some more things about his past.  He still had things he was afraid that if I knew then I wouldn't like him anymore (silly boi after all I have done I could not judge anyone).  He was crying and very emotional with me and all I wanted was to hold him closer and take all his pain away.  If only I could ...    He is so sweet to me and shows remarkable love for me.  I haven't felt this way about anyone since the first boi I ever fell in love with.  I think this is going to last a very long time.  Well we didn't go to atlanta for pride.  Jamie decided not to ... oh well.  It would have been interesting and all, but I was dreading the drive down there and back (all in one day too).  So in a way I am relieved.  There will be plenty more chances to see what pride is like in the years to come.  I don't really agree with the whole thing anyway.  Here they are saying all they want is to be treated the same, but then they go and celebrate being different.   Go figure.  I think I will go to church tomorrow .. then to Sunday dinner at grandmothers.  Man I miss her dinners .. it will be such a treat.  I don't konw how things are giong to be, but I bet no one will say much of anything about what has happened.  WE'LL SEE.  Well I am very tired and my back still hurts (think I pulled a muscle or something).  So I am going to cut this short.    ..laters
