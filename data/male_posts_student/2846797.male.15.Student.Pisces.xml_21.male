In third we watched another part of Schindler's List, which is a great movie by the way. In fourth we played cards the whole period. I managed to win two games of Spoons as well as one game of Shit. Then at lunch I had a Raspberry Slushie and two slices of Pappa John's Pizza. Again in fifth period it was a free day so I just listened to my iPod the whole period. Teacher wasnt here sixth period so we watched a video. Tonight I was able to get my chemistry lab report. I also got some of my RCT2 project done, now it's at about 30% done. Did some graphic work also. Then I decided to update this thing and get everything back in order too thanks to Blogger's all new features. Anyway long time no see guys. Till later. Bye.
