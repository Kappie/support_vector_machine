To describe my feeling, I will use an old analogy of mine: It was like holding it for like 4 hours and then finally letting go. It kinda hurts the whole time because you were holding it for so long, but it's kinda relieving at the same time, but at the end of it all, you feel a WHOLE lot better. And for all of you with sick minds, that was not a sexual reference thing... even though it works for that too :-\.  After I got back from taking THE TEST I chatted a bit, Halo'd a bit, guitar'd a tiny bit, SC'd a bunch and ate. It was a good day off. Oh, tonight I also saw Shrek 2. I liked it, but the whole time I felt like I was laughing harder than everyone else in the theater. Pout.  Man, it's good to be back on bnet sometimes. I get to talk to old friends like PoundCake, tarElendil, Eld, the moronic xojoe, and others. Today in a game of diplo PC and I were reminiscing about the good old days of hy and how it was once REALLY elite. The place is full of newbs now. It's just a really pisser because we can never get a decent game of die, tfh, or anything going without some newb fishstick leaving in the middle. It's just so aggravating, but it's nice to have had those days of perfect pulls from bob, amazing barbs, and near-perfect trigger prep. Good times.  We'll miss you Redender, Refugee_2, Virusfromhell, Eld, tarElendil, Mafia, Little~Mang, and all the others who have departed from our realm. Tear.  I'm going to my uncles graduation tomorrow and then I go to my cousins before I go up north with him to the hill to see the crash site. We will always remember you John Marie St. Francis. Rest In Peace. (This one's a real dedication. The last one was more a joke than anything else. We do miss them too though, just not as much.)  In conclusion, lawyers lawy, fathers fath, mothers moth, and sisters sist. There is nothing we can do about it so why complain? Actually, that reminds me! I heard that they might reinstate the draft in the US which sucks because I'm drafting age. I hate George W. Bush's guts, by the way. I personally think he's a dickhead and I can prove it logically to anyone who's interested. Anyway, I've been thinking about whether I would dodge the draft or not and at first I thought "Shit, man! I'm dodging that thing. EVEN if I have to move to CAMBODIA! I'm not fighting for a draft-dodging prick like Dubya. What a cockbiting fucktard." But then I thought about how that might effect my future career options and then I realized that if I dodge this draft, it'll look really bad on my record if I want to run for president or senator or congressman and I just can't afford to make a mistake like that this early in my career. I'm still torn on the issue so please help me out. Slantface.  In [real] conclusion, I still haven't had any fish yet but I had some Lay's Stax and they were really good. I am tired.  That is all.         -- Feanor
