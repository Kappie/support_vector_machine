I even put an extra paragraph inside what I had planned for "The Sims: Bustin' Out". So, well... Here is the review for Linkin Park, I warn u, it's short!   Linkin Park - Meteora (9 out of 10) I have heard a lot of complaints about this album and how it doesn't stack up to Linkin Park's other album "Hybrid Theory". I think that Meteora is twice as good as Hybrid Theory. I like the tracks like "Figure.09" and "Breaking the Habit". I would sooooo buy this album if you haven't year.  Upcoming CD Reviews:  Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand  My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge  Alexisonfire - Watch Out  New Found Glory - Catylist  Various Artists - Vans Warped Tour Compilation Album
