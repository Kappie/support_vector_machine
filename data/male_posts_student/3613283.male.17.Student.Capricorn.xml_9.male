Well, it's not like people were not aware of what occured there. There is no soldier abusing prisoners, no scandal, no ratings surge, so I guess that's not worth airtime.  For the last 30 years, Iraqis inside Iraq had little knowledge of the full extent of Saddam Hussein's oppressive tactics. Many Iraqis who have documented his regime's history argue that Coalition authorities have not done enough to make this history known to the Iraqi people, and proponents of more stringent de-Baathification argue that until this education is completed, Saddam-era officials cannot be trusted with the rule of the new state.  urlLink AEI Events: Graphic video of Saddam's Tortures
