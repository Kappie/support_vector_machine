Okay, those were some good guesses.  All of them.  Even yours.  But the dessert?  Apple pie standing up inside a crispy pancake.  Really.  Or if it wasn't, it was doing an awesome job pretending.  I mean, it was good apple pie.  Really was.  But I didn't taste no exotic Asian fruits.    Oh well.  It was still worth the $9.50 I didn't have to pay for it.  And if the desserts cost $9.50... well, you can only imagine what the main dishes cost.  I'm currently reading "Backstory" by Ken Auletta, which is a collection of the author's long-form pieces mostly from the New Yorker about the business of journalism, behind-the-scenes at the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the New York Post / Daily News wars.  It's quite, quite excellent.  I wish the postscripts on each piece were longer and didn't try so hard to connect one piece to the next in what ends up feeling like a very forced fashion, but aside from those minor quibbles, it's at times a can't-put-it-down kind of book, and even when it's not, it's a worth-knowing-and-feel-like-I'm-learning-something kind of book.  So it's good.  Of course, I might just be more interested than most in this stuff, as evidenced by  urlLink this site  being one of my few must-read sites at least a couple of times a week.
