I have to admit, I am hooked on a show.  the Osbornes - has to be the funniest show on TV right now.    Ozzy is gone, his kids are characters, and his wife is NUTZ!  I love it.      ***   I worked out legs today and I am so exhausted.  Tonight mimi and I are going to different stores to register for our wedding.  That is totally coming up soon, but I'm not real apprehensive about it anymore, I'm actually super stoked about the deal.  It's really happening and I can't think of a better person to spend my life with, time will tell.   ***   I noticed that March has been a slow month for the spy attack journal. I've been busy; yeah, whatever!  I bet I could always say that.  Any point in my life, I can always say, "Oh Ive been super busy!"  I need to invent a 'busy' meter.  I just don't think I have anything to say, I need to take this journal more personal, not so broadcast like...or some shit.     Anyways,  I have been listening to:  Cave In - Jupiter Nathlie Marchant - Tigerlilly Weezer - blue Saetia and 90.1 NPR  I wish Jets to Brazil would come back through.  I love those guys.  I wish I could book them at my apartment garage.  "Don't mind the dog shit, Watach out for the piss"  By the way, I cleaned all that up last night.  My garage looks cool again.   urlLink    ZZZZZZZZZ~~@@##^^^^^^^^^____---zzZZ radom rules
