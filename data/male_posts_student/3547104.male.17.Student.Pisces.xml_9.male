It was really sad, I tried not to cry, but when you see a really good friend of yours cry, you just can't help but join in.  EVERYONE: keep in mind that we're not invincible. Be safe.  It sounds like a cliche, but it's so true. Doing a ton of homework that was due ten years ago because I'm a lazy fuck and I like doing nothing to benefit my education. I wish I was like Cait; Motivated, a hard worker, sexy, and gorgeous ;-).  And today, my mom gave me a hardcore lecture on how I need to save money and how my spending habits are horrible. So yeah, she's like pissed at me now. And now I'm bored and I don't feel like typing on here, so I shall find entertainment in the realm known as AIM.  Well an airplane’s faster than a Cadillac   And a whole lot smoother than a camel’s back   But I don’t care how you get to me   Just get to me
