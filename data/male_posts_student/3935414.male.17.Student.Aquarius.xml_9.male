It was the first time i actually went forthe interview. I was very nervous then. Firstly being interviewed by the seniors in the hall. I was holding very very tight to the stand of the two desks while answeringtheir questions. I didn't expect myself to get through the first interview because i felt that i busted the whole interview. Hahahaha. I got through anyway. The second interview was much more tough, this time i went out of it with a very disappointed look because during the interview..........................     The DM actually asked:  "Think of 6 people in this room that is not suitable to be a councillor."      A lot of them chose me because of my personality at that time, they knew me as a shy and lacked of confidence person. I myself also chose myself la. That was why i am sad at myself too. The results came out not long after our end of year examination.Guess wat? I actually got in!I wasone of the six students chosen in our class.3 males and 3 females.      That's when istarted my secondary school life as a student councillor.
