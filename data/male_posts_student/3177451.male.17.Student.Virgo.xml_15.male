It's not so bad if I get enough rest the night before, but the first day I got 4 hours cause i couldn't sleep. Hehe, my usual bed time is 5:30 AM, so when i tried to go to bed any earlier than that i couldn't. I ended up watching My Neighbor Totoro at 3 in the morning, lol (such a good movie though ^_____^).  The work itself is kinda boring, and Pete keeps telling the corniest jokes, but i guess it's not so bad. It's my first actual job in 3 years and i'm just happy to have it.  More info on the new project "simple harmonics": The concept of the site is going to be harmonizing music, design, and art to make a good impression on the viewer. As is my current site, this one will be extremely simple, very easy to navigate interface, and hopefully even more content than it's predecessor.  Though I am quite happy that i've finally filled up a good 70% of my site this summer.  I also am working on a painting which i just started last night. Expect to see that uploaded in the next week or so.  Keep on visiting and i'll keep on updating, with hope I can get all of my plans accomplished this year.
