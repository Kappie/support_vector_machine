       
      On Monday, just as I was about to leave for school, four lovely little packages arrived from Play.com, and much to my delight, they were the cds I had ordered the Thursday before. First package ripped to shreds that I remember had to be  urlLink The Flaming Lips'  album 'Hear It Is'. This was followed by my cries of glee as I opened my second package,  urlLink Boards Of Canada's  great album 'Geogaddi'. Having looked at their website just now I recommend you take a visit, very nice Flash stuff in there.  Third package turned out to be  urlLink The Zuton's  'Who Killed The Zutons?'. which had to be my most awaited album of all four. And to top it off, Keane's (whose web address escapes my mind right now) 'Hopes And Fears'.  Still waiting for my U2 album to arrive, and even now, at time of posting this, has not arrived.  The Zutons totally blow away all the opposition in this album, having plenty of tracks that I already know the lyics to, and have shown to others. Next comes Boards Of Canada, which people I give a taster of, they do not like, which then I guess confirms that they are lunatics (oh yes, loonies).  Keane do have a good album, its fairly consistent and has some amazing tracks, and the first bar in 'Somewhere Only We Know' is powerful and gears you up straight from the very start.  The Flaming Lips' 'Hear It Is' is definitely not their best album, but still has great tracks. 'With You' is a song so lyrically simple and built up well with a crescendo that its hard to hate, its the Lips as they are, even if this was released in 1986. 'Unplugged' is a prime example of their punk sound, but most I could pick out during the first listen was the expletive 'shit', as what seemed to me, quite random. The rest of the record is great, and 'Summertime Blues' as a punk cover is explosive and lovely finish to the record.  The school week has been uneventful and dull, proving that school really is just not interesting anymore. During Monday's tutor period I visited Becci to organise an appointment with Connexions, and I was told that she would try and contact her and I was then given an information card. My thoughts then convinced me that I wasn't going to get an appointment and should just try and forget everything.  However I did get an appointment, I bumped into Becci on Tuesday and hse informed me that I were to have a meeting with the advisor at Connexions today. I was told to expect a slip taking me away from one of my lessons today, so that was that I thought, I had a meeting today.  Then I remembered.  "Oh crap, I have Ecology study at Lawns Woods in Science today. Lesson four. No doubt I'll get called for then, and I won't be there to go, I bet she does."  And my suspicions were correct, when I went to the office to check, I was informed that I was called for at lesson four and I replied that I was away on ecology study.  Damn.  Back I went to Becci, who told me that the Connexions person has gone for lunch and may come back, but may not. So after lunch I waited at the office for five minutes with Jessica, then gave up on all hope that she had returned.  Wednesday I was given a note to say that I had a meeting with Connexions on Thursday at 9am, so that was good. The rest of the day really flew by and I can't renember much anyway.  The meeting with Connexions was a bit tense at times . . . There were a lot of awkward silences where I couldn't think of what to say, and unsure of whether I should say some things. First we discussed careers, and I managed to find out a bit more about journalism and music, which was good. After about half an hour of discussing careers, I was given a little card and on there it listed many things that I may have wished to talk about. Briefly spoke about health, which moved on to how much I sleep, and this led to being asked if I felt a little depressed. I brushed it off as hormones, as when you think about it, it really is, and that was the end of the discussion, although I was advised to go see the school nurse. I thanked the person there and went to tutor as usual.  Nothing had happened until Friday, which was my mentoring meeting at school. I do not see the point in them, you go to the school for ten minutes to discuss whats going well for you and whats not going well for you, then you leave and have the day off. I'm not complaining, but it does seem a little silly if you ask me.  With the day off, I went into town with Matt, at the very early time of 9am (I consider this early as I am a lazy child), most shops were closed as expected, but we killed sometime then headed off to check out deals on XBoxs. In the end Matt went for a bundle offer that Game had, £150 for an XBox, extra controller, and two games of his choice, providing that they cost under £40. With a tenner left, he gave it to me on the one condition that I continue to work well in school, and I promised too, so trip to HMV!  Picked up 'Led Zeppelin IV' and 'Hit To Death In The Future Head' by The Flaming Lips, in a buy one get one free offer, came to £11 in the end. I was pleased I decided to bring my own measly balance of £3 with me, as it turned out to be life-saving, I had to get my hands on Led Zeppelin IV or I would cry!  Walked to Matt's after, and played Project Gotham Racing for a while, was fun, I managed to do over 100mph in a Volkswagen, and I tell you now, you haven't lived until you've driven a Volkwagen at over 100mph! Or maybe not, but there you go, thats me. Landmines on Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow are funny. Matt decided the only way to get over them must be by jumping, how wrong he was. The screen was shrouded from the mine explosion and a little, "pfffft" could be heard. Both of us burst into fits of laughter, and then got past the first batch of mines. We continued walking along and all of a sudden, the screen became shrouded again and a little, "pfffft" could be heard. There was silence for a second, and then we erupted into laughter once more. I have no idea, but at the time it just seemed hilarious.  I left at about 1:15pm to see Jess, and stayed there for a while. Nothing really happened, except for watching Jess be a little clumsy around the kitchen. Had to leave at 2 because her mum might return, and Jess wasn't allowed any visitors whilst her mum was out, so I left, went to Tesco's and bought some Dr Pepper.  Knocked for Rebecca but she wasn't in, (I was told later on MSN that she was in, but opened the door and I had gone) and I began walking home. Looking at my watch, it told me that it was 2:30pm, I thought about what I could do. I could go back to my school and offer a helping hand, although the mentoring meetings would end pretty soon, and I wouldn't reach there until about 2:45pm anyway. Then I thought, what about my old school? Doesn't school finish there at 3pm? I could go there and say hi to the teacher that I knew. Going along with this plan I walked towards my old school, aware that I had plenty of time.  I passed my old school at 2:45 thinking I could see my nan, and so I did. As I walked past the school I could confirm that they were in school, as children were doing PE outside. I arrived at my nan, who seemed surprised and pleased to see me, and also told me that school finished at 3:15 there, not 3:00 as I previously thought. This gave me some time to relax, so I had a drink and spoke to my nan for a while.  My old school seems very small to me now, and it seems that a lot of teachers have left now, leaving only Mrs Ash, Mr Morris and Mrs Harris the familiar faces that I remember. I spoke to Mrs Ash first, being my teacher for my last two years of junior school. She recognised me instantly, which is a little different considering others took a while to recognise me. I offered to help them around the school for their last three days, and waited in the reception to talk to Mrs Harris.  The school is still the same in my opinion, it seems smaller to me seeing as I do go to a secondary school, but I still see a lot of work that my year made around the school. Most of it was the abstract paintings that have been scattered across the hall, and some leaves all put together to resemble a tree, was supposed to show that the school is united, I'm pretty sure thats what it meant. I do believe they have better equipment for theatrical productions now, even though the hall is short of space for a proper stage, they've still got a good PA system and lights, which I consider excellent for a primary school.  After talking to Mrs Harris I went home and found out that I was bought a new mobile phone! Woo yay! If I remember, its an NEC e313 on 3 pay as you go. Its all spiffy and has a camera, which makes a vast improvement from my previous phone, so I was happy. My only fault in it is that it has the length of my TV remote control, but seeing as I can fit my CD Player in my pocket, I'm sure I could get it in my pcoket with ease. Still can't remember my phone number, and I haven't jotted it down somewhere either so I have to get that done.  Using my phone I downloaded the video to XFM's alternative England Euro 2004 anthem, 'Born In England'. I have to say that the song will probably sell better than 'Altogether Now' as it follows the traits of many England anthems. The song is patriotic all the way through and I guess thats what makes a football anthem sell, even though I would like to see 'Altogether Now' sell more.  The weekend managed to pass by uneventfully, and I got bored to a point where I began to write the blog entry that you happen to be reading right now, except for that I got bored of that, saved a draft and continued it on Tuesday (the day I'm writing it now).  By Monday my U2 album still hadn't arrived, but unfortunately not a thing could be done about it because it wasn't 14 days since the order, so I just hoped it would arrive on Tuesday.  It still hadn't arrived.  I did get two nice e-mails through my inbox though. One said that my order for 'Beautiful Freak' by The Eels had been despatched now that it came into stock, and another saying that they had despatched 'War' by U2. War was the CD I had been waiting for. So as it seems, the CD that I had been waiting for over a week now, hadn't even been despatched yet. I felt a bit angry, they did send me an e-mail over a week ago saying they did despatch it, but this one had told me the same.  This brings the blog up-to-date for now, sorry its been so long without an entry, I just guess I've been lazy. I promise I'll get the pictures from Salcombe up too, thats one job I've been avoiding due to about 100 shots ruined by rain on lens, so I need to edit it all out before I can do anything.  Ciao.
