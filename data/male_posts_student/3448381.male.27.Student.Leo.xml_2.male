I once thought fathers were meant to be bad people and that everyone had terrible fathers. Once in a class in college, we were talking about the role of the father in American society and I happened to blurt out "doesn't everyone have bad fathers?" I truly thought at that time, for the last twenty years of my life, that this was normal. I guess I was wrong, because everyone in the class gave me a hard time and talked about how great their fathers were.  I always reflect on that day when I am thinking about my father. I see how I have grown from being jealous of the people with good dads to finally accepting my childhood with my dad. As I am get older and more settled with my wonderful husband, I understand more how hard it is to be a father. I will never completely understand the pressures that fathers face. However, what I do know is that I have to accept my father for who he is in order for me to accept myself for who I am.   Thanks for allowing me this opportunity to write.
