On wed i was stoning around at home watching another box of gundam seed that i just bought yesterday. watched finished it again and yearned for some more. Yup i think i am addicted to that anime now. I realised that lawn bowls training was shifted to the morning and i woke up at 10 way past the starting time. Drat i thought it was in the afternoon at the usual time.I gotta train more often, got a competition coming up in like one month, so i must make sure i go on friday morning.   In the nite, i went to plaza singapura to have dinner with my mom, after that i met my old friend joel for a movie. before that we were basically toking cock and roaming round the place. Passed by the arcade and saw some girls doing the para para dance, hm pretty nice music i must say. Harry potter is a nice show, although i didnt watch the first 2 films , i still found it enjoyable and quite intriging. Now i noe why so many pple absoulutely dig this show and read the books. hm by the time the show finished it was midnite and we had to rush to catcth the last mrt train back home. I reached a deserted orchard road at 0020 to find that the last 174 had left already... In the end i still managed to get home. i shall talk about thursday another time
