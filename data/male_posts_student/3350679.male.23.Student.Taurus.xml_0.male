Me on the other hand is going to be desperatley trying to get a job and then trying to find somewhere any where to live and along with that trying not to hit someone or something   My Aunt and Uncle want me out fine I say but since I have no maony and do not know where I am going this is proving to be a bit of a fucking challenge for me and they have the nerve to pretend that they are doing this out of some way helping me with quotes such as   "we just want you to be with people your own age"  Fuck you jesus I have really being enjoying my time down here in Yorkshire but these last few weeks have really fucked me off about everything I am in the exact position I was last year with no direction but instead of having really cool friend s around that helped me like I did in Aberdeen I have a nurotic uncle and aunt putting pressure on me to fit into their idea of a perfect clone of I dont know what only I do not want to be it   that it for now let u know if I have killed anyone  Ps I dont care if there is spelling maistakes because I can not be bothered about spell checking this  Stephen
