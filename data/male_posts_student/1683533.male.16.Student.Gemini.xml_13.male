I had a very odd feeling today...I was riding home from my dad's house....it was dark out, and there was this song playing that i don't remember the name of, but i liked it.....but what i mainly remember was how dark it was...I dont know why....but I felt extremely humbled...yet I felt very anxious at the same time (anxiety not anxiousness)....it was very odd....so I just sat there-arms crossed because my dad always blasts the AC-waiting to get home...well...to my mom's house I should say.....  I was kinda mad...because I was in a pretty good mood because I was talking to my friends when I got home...and then I had to get off cause my sister wanted to get on.....and that makes me mad cause I look forward to talking to some of my friends....just being around people you know care about you...even if they don't tell you......eh....I don't want to get all mushy because I think mushiness can get  really  corny....  No band practice till tuesday....Ben is at Cedar point....last I heard from him he got in a fight with his girlfriend....I hope everything is okay with that...I'd hate to see him all stressed over that....i never seen him go out with somebody this long....he really loves that girl...  I just took out the trash....and it was very surreal outside....I never been out in my neighborhood at 1:30 in the morning...and it is extremely quiet....almost in a humbling way......but I saw flickers of light...at first I thought it was the street light flickering or a bug zapper....but it was in the sky, and I guess it was lightning...but there was no thunder....and the sky is an eerie red right now....and it seems too bright to be 1:30....I hope it does rain.......the pitter patter of rain drops lull me to sleep....ugh that last sentence was very....uhm...can't remember the word.....but I am gonna go back outside and sit on my porch...because the silence is very comforting.....well...that's all for now...later...
