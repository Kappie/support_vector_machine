They also aren't in any particular order of "favorites".    1.  BIG FISH- this movie is extremely wierd yet captivating.  It has to be one of the most creative movies ever made.  At the same time it also had multiple deep messages that one can only get if they think out side the box.   2.  TOP GUN- This is the first movie i ever bought.  I know I can watch this movie over and over because I have while growing up.  The sadist part is that it never gets old.  Cheezy? absolutly.  It also has slightly homoerotic themes while it can only laugh at, but it is a great movie that I am glued to when ever its on.    3.  ABOUT A BOY-  This movie hardly makes anybodies list, at least not any Ameircans.  It is extremely British, and Hugh Grant plays his usual "I'm a shallow British playboy who suddenly discovers a higher meaning of life."  Its dry and friken hallarious.  Plus- every time I watch it- I speak in a slight British accent, even if I try not to.  4.  BILLY MADISON- The Panguin alone can make the list.  This whole movie is filled with random pointless jokes that make my stomach hurt from laughing.  I swear every scene is memorable.  How can this movie not make my list?  5.  ROCKY IV-  This, like Top Gun,  I grew up watchin over and over again, so its also time tested.  I sing along to the 80's beats and I am still on the edge of my seet in the last fight.  I only hope my mother doesn't walk in when I'm shaddow boxing, pretending that I'm betting up the Russian.  Movies that came close- Momento, Orange County, The Power Of One, and The Program.
