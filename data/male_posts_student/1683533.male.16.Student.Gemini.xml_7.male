Anyways, a wierd thing happened on my way back from the gas station (I usually go for a walk to the gas station at night...get a slurpee....and some candy....bring my cd player...sorta get away from it all....).  So, I was walking down the pathway and there is woods on both sides of the pathway....and I saw this thing moving in front of me...like 10 feet away....and it was a skunk....so I started backing away...and i noticed there was another one 10 feet further down....so i backed off and waited.....and then i sort of hung to the right and kept walking once i knew they were outta sight....and then another one came walking across the pathway!  3 skunks?  I was like walking thru a fucking migration or something....or maybe just a momma and here babies.....so i just played it safe and took the long way home which is going al the way to school craft and then walking into my sub on ashurst..........but yea....that's the closest I ever got to a skunk....and that is the most skunks i have seen at once....i believe.....  It is late....my mom has been bugging me about what time i goto bed....but....i shouldn't matter....i would just lay in bed till 2 anyways....cause i am just not tired....  I am redesigning my room....I am gonna have a water theme....one part of the wall will be blue (water)...then the other yellow (sand)...and i'll put like waves in the water and stuff.....I also got a new bedspread.....it has like a water theme on it too.....oh and i got a spongebob alarm clock that plays the spongebob squarepants song for the alarm.....yea....that is a water type theme.....but the best things i got were these lamps....ok you fill them up with water....and then you put plastic fish in them...it's like a tank you fill up....and then air gets pumped into the tank from the bottom and bubbles come up so the plastic fish move all around...and there is a light on the bottom that changes different colors....its hard to explain....but at night i put those on and my lava lamp...so there are all these colors....it would be a good place to have sex *laughs*...dim lights....different colored lighting...wierd lamps....oh yea....ok....i am going off into daydream land again heh.....  but yea....thats whats been going on lately...also been working on the band and-wait i cant talk about that in here....go into my band blog and check it out!....well....i am gonna go....to bed....with all the different color dim lights....and wierd lamps.....wishing i had a girlfriend....to do....in that room that would be good to do stuff in....yea....daydreaming....again.....tired...man....i shouldn't be writing about that stuff.....oh well...it's my blog....i can write whatever the hell i want.....so there.......well....bye  "You say that you love me but you aren't in love with me." -The Vandals
