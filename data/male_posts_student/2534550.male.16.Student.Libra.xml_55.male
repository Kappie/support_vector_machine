So anyways after school today Sadia, Chelsea, Justin, and I all met in the band room to get ready to go over to Chelsea's house to set up for the party. We got all of our instruments together and headed to the car. Leave it to Sadia to do something we were walking through the halway and she flipped backwards over a chair ending up with her french horn on top of her. We all laughed and headed to my car but we couldnt possibly get all the way there without something else happening. Picture this: it's raining and were walking Chelsea insists we stop because she hears a frog so we're standing in the rain waiting for her to find the frog. Long story short she never found the frog. Finally we get to my car and eventually find a way for us all to fit. So off to Chelsea's house we went.   We got there and to my surprise (haha) Sadia was hungry so we got some coupons to Subway and headed there. Sadia loud as usual walked into Sadia yelling "Why are they staring at me? Its because im black." So when we went in everyone ended up stareing at us neway and we realized we needed to pull together money so we left and realized that togos is better neway. So we went there and ate while I talked to some of my former co-workers.   When we went back to Chelsea's house Ricky was there so we started some of the videos while Brenden and Eric walked in. They left and Justin wanted to go with them so bad (Justin wants to be a stoner so bad but he cant find it in him to actually smoke so he hangs out with them to feel cool) It was so funny because Sadia made a comment about them forgetting the leash or something so he couldnt go but she kept like barking and he had know idea. After watching Phantom Regiment we turned off the tv and headed up stairs. I hooked up my laptop and went online while i staired at the pictures of BDB and the drill and stuff. At first we had nothing to do but we then remembered that we had digital camera fun to have so we spent about 1 hr. shooting photos and just laughing (cept Justin hes ashamed of us, he told us) So after this we decided that Justin was getting on our nerves continuously saying "Pat ill pay u if u take me home." so i took his money and we took a ride. The road is really narrow but the ride was fun with us riding on the wrong side and the continuous flash from the camera. When we went back to Chelsea's we sat around for another couple hours and then me and Sadia went home.
