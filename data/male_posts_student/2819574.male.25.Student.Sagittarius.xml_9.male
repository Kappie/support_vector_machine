Now more interesting was her main thesis, namely people are overtly optimistic about their future choices (not her thesis, that's already been documented). So there exist choices where you have the choice between a vice item (imagine a brownie) and a virtue item (insert the apple here). Now if you have an isolated single choice you have some probability to pick the virtue item, however if you know that you have the same choice in the future again, you are more likely to pick the vice item (since you are believing that you will act virtuosly in the future and pick the apple then, but hey, we know that this belief is wrong....)  What does this tell us know, aehmmmmmm, maybe I will use this blog as a virtue item (doing something for the public good....;-) )everytime I get a too large Ice cream (major vice item for me)
