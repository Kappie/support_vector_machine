How effective can you be if your clients are doing what they are there to cure.  5. NAACP    Cause: National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.    Reason they suck: Get your people to read then we'll take you seriously.  6. EAW    Cause: Environmentalists Againast War    Why they suck: Oh, a double whammy. I hate people who bitch about green peace. Also I support the war. This group unified the environmentalists. What a shitty idea, who cares about "US clusterbombs, thermobaric explosions, electromagnetic bursts and weapons made with depleted uranium are indiscriminate weapons of mass destruction.". Boo fucking hoo.  I think that about covers it theres probably a lot more that I just don't feel like taking the time to list. Leave a comment on the ones I forgot.
