Of the 8,000 Aetas in the Pampanga region, very few if any have an education higher than elementary.     My concerns in regards to my clothing was confirmed when Arnel explained that the Aetas mistrust the military because of being caught in the cross-fire of NPA and military. They are also targeted by the military on raids for weapons and confiscating weapons the Aeta use for hunting.
