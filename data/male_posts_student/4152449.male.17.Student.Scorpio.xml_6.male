After the events of last night it seems I have a hippy alter ego, like Yugi has an alter ego who is an ultra cool, slightly taller, card playing ancient pharaoh. Sadly my alter ego isn’t ultra cool or slightly taller or has his own television show and range of merchandise. No my alter ego seems to be the unholy child of Beck (the much loved 70’s styled artist of the mid 90’s) and Shaggy (from Scooby doo)  I think I may gain some amazing Hippy Powers when I metamorphose but all I can remember was the uncontrollable desire for Pizza, to have my hair put into dread locks and more importantly using the words ‘like’, ‘man’ and ‘dude’ far to much.  As I was saying last night was a blur, but when I woke up this morning I found I was wearing flares, had written and recorded several songs promoting scientology, solved the mystery of the Indooroopilly shopping center and had taken out a patent on a catch phrase.  But this left me with a question how I transformed? Was it because of the half moon or the 18th birthday or had I been bestowed with the power of Hippy-ness in the same way the power rangers had power-rangerness bestowed on them.    I am not sure we will just have to wait and see.  But on a unhippy related topic i have to talk about music.  i love music and atm i am enjoying Safri duo, Robert Miles, the blue man group, Simple Plan, Millencolin, Bomfunk, Beethoven and Mozart  this hasnt got anything to do with anything i was wanted to mention my play list on sonic stage 2  Well that was me procrastinating and avoiding studing  Az
