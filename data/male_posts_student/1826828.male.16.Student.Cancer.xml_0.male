Anyone who has not had to suffer the pain of Statistics Coursework will be unaware of the shear boredom, endless writing and calculations that the coursework causes. I managed to fill 14 solid pages of writing in three hours (we have to copy it all out under exam conditions) Plus a load of painstakingly drawn graphs. My life is now complete.   Worms World Party  Incidentally, I nicked the CD of this brilliant game of a friend yesterday. It is pretty much Worms 2 but with some extras. I had forgotten how much fun those games are. Go play it. Dig out your copy of worms, worms2, worms armaggedon or WWP. Sooooo much fun!
