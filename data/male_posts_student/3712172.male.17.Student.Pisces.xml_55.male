Works been fairly busy, I have been dealing with the same thing however since 9:30 this morning. Letter after letter for the same reason. I am getting disgusted with the same call every 2 minutes. I guess that's life some days though, eh?  I'm not quite keen on typing anything interesting right now so I guess I may have to blab about things that are on my mind...  I'm pretty pumped that I finally got my site up and running thru tylerkuhk.com. It cost me about $20 Canadian for two years. I still have much more to do, but at least the basics are done. I'm currently hosting it on my own server, which consists of the ever so famous Pentium 200 MMX. That way I don't have to worry about relying on any free hosting servers, or to have to pay for hosting. This way it's all done for free.  Other than that not too much else is new. I suppose I should head back because my break is finished in about 10 minutes.  .: Sinful Misery :.  urlLink My Site   Bye all.
