Now I know you could say alot about good ol' George dubya but I will not waste my time (or yours) talking about all the wonderful things Mr. Bush has done for the country (sense the sarcasm please).  The Bush administration has shifted their focus of the "Weapons of Mass Destruction" not on actually finding these WMDs , because they have failed miserably in finding them (if they ever existed at all) but now they are shifting to "intent." INTENT they want to justify the war in Iraq on the premise that Saddam Hussein "intended" to create and use WMD's...........how can anyone justify the deaths of thousands of people (regardless of who they are) by saying "well they intended to use weapons of mass destruction." And based on that flimsy logic they justified a war that has benefitted no one.   I do not argue that Saddam Hussein was a good person, he wasnt. He was a sick dictator with no respect for anyone, not even his own people. But removing him from his position was something that either the people of Iraq should have done or the United Nations. But because of this war the UN has been shown to be nothing but a powerless collection of nations too scared to stand up to a bully.  The war in Iraq has not helped the United states in any way. The reputation of americans around the world is in the gutter. America is the most hated nation in the world and yet Mr. Bush says things are great. The economy is in the toilet, our government's deficit is through the roof AGAIN and jobless rates are at the highest they've been since......well since the last Bush was in office. And all this in the name of what? in the name of INTENT ?? thats ridiculous. Its sick to think that all this "good" was done in the name of Intent.......The daily....damn it daily deaths of American soldiers who are supposed to securing a country in which "combat has ended" If combat has ended why are these boys still dying ? Not to mention the countless numbers of Iraqis who have died and its not like we in america would get the real numbers of casualties...american or otherwise.   It just frustrates me that we as a country have a Presidential administration that justifies all the horrors of war on Intent. It is the most pathetic attempt at back-pedaling that i have ever seen. The Bush administration tried to justify the war by saying that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and now that everyone knows that there never were any WMDs the administration is just trying to save face in front of the nation. I hope we arent stupid enough to fall for this crap come November.
