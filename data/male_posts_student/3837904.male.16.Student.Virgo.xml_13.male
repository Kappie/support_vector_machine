It's quite long actually and even people who're not close to me begin to wounder whats wrong with things. 3 weeks for a best friend to be ignored is far too much time already. But I suppose I'll be waiting again for the right time that he would speak. For I hope things are fine around him and his swifting his way along the streets joyfully. For this side ain't a good or nice shot to be in. Suffering everyday from any memories that I could dig up to. I've also reach up to a state of dead emotions. Smiling and laughting with tears and the eager to cry. =)
