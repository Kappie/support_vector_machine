It its scary, its is lovey, it is funny, and like all of his other movies it has a HUGE TWIST. but im not going to give that away. all im going to say is GO SEE IT!!!!  I got paid $143.00 today. Currently in my wallet i have $16.00, man lets see what i bought today:  1.) Taking Back Sunday- Where you want to be ( oh my god, can you say extremely awesome? This cd is amazing, the music actually sucks you in and doesnt let you go until the cd is over, and then from that point you just want to play it again, ive listened to it 7 times today already) 2.) The Unseen- The anger and the truth 3.) Bad Religon- The empire strikes first (if you havent caught on those are all cd's, those cd's cost $32.00 dollars total) 4.) Hellboy special edition 2 disc dvd 5.) $18.77 worth of gas ( a full tank) 6.) 2 magazines 7.) The Village movie ticket, $8.00  That is everything i bought today. i should really not be allowed to hold onto my own money, im horrible with it.  Hahaha after the movie we went over to brittanys house (Me, Vanessa, Brittany, Preston) and we ate food and ran around. Me and vanessa gave each other wedgies and i mean major wedgies, the kind where your butt hurts for a little bit after you pick them out haha. Then after vanessa left brittany got really scared because she thinks the ghost of abraham lincoln is in her house, so of course me and preston had to scare her even more. it was fun.  Tonight im going to sleep until 3pm tomorrow because i have to work from 5 to 11, and then i have to do it again on sunday, and then on monday i work 5-8, tuesday i work 5-7 and wednesday i work 5-8. man, i work alot. you should all feel sorry for me.  Lately i have been feeling really really good, i have no pressure on me and i can pretty much do what i want. me and my dad and my brother are all getting along, my dad is letting me go places and not saying no. lately everything has been going my way. i feel good, very good. i want to feel like this forever.  I had a mountain dew and now im not tired :)
