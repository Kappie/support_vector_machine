If you can't figure out what sn stands for, good, because it's very racial. BUT HILARIOUS. So, when I got home from school, I went out with my mom to buy the AEnima cd (Tool) which I had broken my old one WHICH IS ANCIENT! AND IT'S MY FAVORITE CD! Ok, so it took us 3 stores considering the one we went to the other day (Borders) after eating at Outback. Anyways, I finally found it in Circuit City. It was so great, in FYE, the guy pronounced it ONEMA...oh god I wanted to laugh in his face and then spit on him. Ok, so at night I went to Keith's and we had fun in this base he made, fort, base, whateva! God I'm dying to be Jewish, Mel Brooks is my Jewish hero. Then at the game and I hung out with numerous amount of people. Then I got slapped by this kid Tyler in 9th because I was wearing a ripped open kick ball on my head pretending to be Davy Crockett. Little wankster, if I see him again I'll probably fight him. Thing is, he might have his friends and shit and knifes, you know wankstas, they're pussies. Well the 9th graders are. I know alot of cool sophmore wankstas, so I guess their not wankstas...they're just people. Well what is the true definition of wanksta? Are wankstas the cool ghetto kids or gay ones? OR BOTH!? To me wankstas are the fags/pussies. Anyways, I really didn't wanna fight because I would have crushed this kid in two seconds and he backed away from me. Everyone was egging me on, but you know, I just couldn't. I would of gotten in trouble and shit...ya know. And he would have gotten his older brother (so I hear he has) after me...complete gayness. So screw it, next time, he does shit like that to me again, his face will be on the ground, against the concrete, out for the night. Ok, then I watched the game with other people. Then I went to the Murphy's, my cousins. Hung out with Britt, played THPS4. My sister claimed she can ride faster by pressing start and then continue...haha that's definetly going to help. Today, I got new tom heads for my drum set. Then, I worked out with Paul, great work out. Then around 8, Chris M came over and is sleeping over. Right now we're both watching Austin Powers...and it's 2:30 PM so goodnight.
