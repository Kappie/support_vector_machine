The post-modernist answer to the enlightenment, draws a middle path between rationalist, functionalist among many others who seek to theorize the many different schools of thought at that time and their impact on society. While relativism is almost philosophical, as opposed to say functionalism or symbolic interationism, which is probably why it has seen little popularity with sociologists.   There are a plethora of objections to relativism, say, moral relativism for one. The belief that there is no right nor wrong, that right or wrong is relative, subject to a particular "discourse" as Foucault puts it, or a socio-cultural setting. While it sounds pretty idealistic and fantastic, and maybe a little "intellectual", what is its implications? What about the holocaust and the crusades? Is the holocaust simply a relative crime? A product of simply an act which cannot fit into the norms of society at that time?  If you say yes, after all, the morality of such acts can be debated on paper, but if moral relativism  is brought about into a political level, and put in the hands of Adolf Hitler, let me see if staunch supporters would still be singing the same tune if their families were massacered, no different from Pol Pot's. But while moral relativism poses such moral questions, it is not completely invalid. But for one, we have to redefine the definition of relativism. If relativism is the belief that all systems/schools of thought/cognitive processes are equal and are simply relative to a particular socio-cultural setting, what do I really believe relativism is?  In my opinion, not all moral and cognitive processes are equal, but for one, none possesses absolute truth nor is it absolutely null and void, yes, all are subject to a particular set of discourses, but that does not mean that none possess objectivity, after all, the subjective is required to elucidate the objective. The very extreme interpretation of relativism as seen above is really what I call Relativistic Fundamentalism. I guess we have forgotten what relativism was really all about.   Its like christians forgetting what Jesus has taught them and start bashing other religions with the bible, and if they have political power, they start bashing with the sword. We have to understand the purpose of relativism that one, there is no such thing as total positivism, no scientific theory or process is exempt from social construction. And that true (note I said true not total) objectivity comes when looking at a theory from different sets of discourses, a physicist doing a paper on sound waves would be wiser if he looks at the subject not only from a physics point of view, but maybe a musical one, start learning the 7 notes or scales, to inject a different point of view and to utilize a different discourse in his work, who knows what new theory can he come up with?  And lastly of course, relativism is all about tolerance and about rational discussion about other schools of thoughts which can be found to be morally wanting, instead of just simply adopting a nihilistic stance and reject moral essentialism totally. Moral essentialism to a large extent gives rise to bigotry, no doubt about that, but its absence would be the start of anarchy and lawlessness. Relativism, in my opinion is the best doctrine where our drive to learn is conerned, for a learner of the sociology of science, why stop there? Why not take a course in quantum physics or learn about classical physics and its theories? Relativism is all about eclectism, taking the best out of every belief system or cognitive process, and apply it to our lives, and this would be our never-ending drive to pursue knowledge, who knows what we can come up with in the process? Inter-galactic travel? Renewable energy? I don't know.......
