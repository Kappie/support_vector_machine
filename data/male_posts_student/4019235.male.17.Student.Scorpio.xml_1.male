Speaking of cyborgs, I saw I, robot today. The story goes like this:     I am a robot. And I have to obey 3 laws.     First, I cannot harm a human, I must protect them.     Second, I must obey human commands unless that violates the first law.     Third, I cannot initiate self- defense that may violate the previous 2 laws.     V.I.K.I., the A.I construct that was supposed to keep a watch over all the other robotic module suddenly discovers it can rewrite it’s own program and “evolve”. Wow, couple that with it’ newly thwarted logic that goes like this: humans have a tendency to harm anoter, as evident from previous wars and conflicts in the past. Thus to protect human-kind, I must strip them of their power and have my little sentinels look over them and prevent them from harming each other. Anybody stopping me from reaching this goal will die, as a small sacrifice to the greater good. Along came Sonny, a “different” robot with real human emotions that counteracts V.I.K.I.’s violent intentions. All in all a cool show with a nice twist in the end to make up for the lack of nice, bare-bodied actresses.                   Next AVP2, the show I have been anticipating ever since august last year. To see my favourite big time monsters clash and eat and slash and kill like nobody’s business excites me. Expect the raking claws that digs deep into your flesh, the intention of the alien drone not to feed but to torture and explore. The huge poison stained tail that lashes out at you and hooks you onto the small grooves of the spiny appendix. And of course, who can forget the jaws and inner jaws that springs out from a steamy slivery outer jaw. Whoa scary. Enter the Predator, bad ass warrior with full blades and guns compliment. With assortments ranging from a plasma detonator to shoulder cannons and the disc slicer, what’s not to like about him? The coolest thing probably about the Predator is the mask that features up to 4 vision modes, 3 dimensional surrounding mapping, an infra red filter, a xenophobic current tracker and the wide field normal vision mode. Plus real time field data sampling, nothing escapes the sight of the Predator. “Whoever wins, we lose”, yeah right, lets see hoards of stupid aliens running against a guy with a “smart gun” with homing bullets, a napalm flamethrower as seen in Aliens: Resurrection with a range of 10 meters, Predators facing off a guy with minigun with AP bullets that is normally used against tanks. The best of the human arsenal? The whooping juggernaught weighing up to 2 tons, carries enough ammunition for long range deployment. What am I talking about? It’s MAX of course, the “Mobile Exosuit Warrior”. Looks like a mech, got guns like a mech, it’s a god damn mech! Imagine full armour compliments with acid resistance exosuit, a flame thrower and laser on one arm and a minigun and rockets on the other arm, no man (xenomorphs and Pratorians alike) could stand the mighty MAX. Haha, so much speculation, so Fox Entertainment, you folks had better not disappoint me.                   Enough of the movie hype, lets come back to earth, this mudane reality I exist in. Sigh, a chem test tmr that I am still ill prepared, a maths tutorial that I was supposed to finish like 10 of my previous assignments, and a shitty long day tmr. Yet, today, I can be playing and watching movie. Lol (weak, self-denying laughter). Lets not talk about this anymore yeah.                    Hey! Jonathan, you gotta stop playing so much anymore. Anybody reading this that knows jon, I plead u to curb his playful desire, that includes you Audrey, keep him satisfied some way or another. And if you cant keep it in, pls do not make me join in playing. I WANT to stop playing as of next week. Thank you.
