The can was dated 1993--probably the year thefinal saccharin report came out. The dangers of saccharin have yet to be proven. It tasted like crap--the fact that it may cause cancer just adds insult to injury. To purchase vintage TAB or other sodas that were virtually discontinued(for good reason) contact:  urlLink http://www.sodaking.com  urlLink
