Paul came over before to study but of course the study party turned into Mario Party. Then online just 10 minutes ago me and Heaton had a great and fun argument as we usually do only this one was the biggest. At the end, I told him I enjoyed it when he says I suck at drums because it motivates me so now I turned Heaton into a Tom drummer pesemist. Woah! 1 hour and my blogger will be a year old! Baby blogger is now a 1 year old...tomorrow I'll have a huge celebration thing for it. Ok, goodnight.
