[fastforward fastforward!]   On my way home,I gave dad a call,told him to pick me up at YCK mrt if he could but I didn't get the message across cos there was alot of background noise.Then suddenly my father said in chinese ,"Got indians chatting!" and after a considerable pause he said,"Keep quiet la!" Then he hung up. 0_0   So I gave mum a call and asked wheres my father,she said, with her at church.0_0 Considering the fact that only 0.000001% of indians are christians,I thought that its quite strange that there are indians around my father in the church.Anyway she passed my father the msg.   So when I got into the car at YCK,dad told me that the phone lines or something were crossed and he said he could hear 2 indians conversing during the call.0_0 I am quite sure i've not heard any indians.He then told me that everytime I call him from amoy qwee,there will be these 2 idiotic pple talking.I am positive I have not heard them.I don't think its possible that the phone lines could be crossed cos HPs don't work like your normal house tele.   -___-  Oh yes,30K credits for every GB account thats been created during and before the GB server crash!!!Add me to your buddy list if you would ,user ID : Lesfilles
