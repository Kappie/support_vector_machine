"internal server error"? whatever. maybe you could just post an email, so i could just email you and get a response. oh well, thats what i get for free. :oP i am contacting everyone i can think of. if anyone reading this has any clues, please drop me a line... otherwise, tomorrow is the final day of classes. it's coming right down to the wire. i still need to finish my armor. no sleep till brooklyn...
