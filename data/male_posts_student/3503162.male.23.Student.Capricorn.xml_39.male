The preceptor is a good bloke but the work is deadly boring, pun intended.  Group partner went skitz at me for not completing a poster, well communication error there no need to go crazy on me.  Rural placements came out, unexpectantly got none of my four preferences! Somebody must hold a grudge against me!  The only expected thing was that the train was late again :P
