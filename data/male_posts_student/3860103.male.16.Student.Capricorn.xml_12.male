We rode horses.  I named mine Horse.  I will always remember him fondly.  Then we returned to Denielle's house. Other people ate cake and ice cream, and I had a nice bottle of water.  Many things were discussed, including the fact that someone I know has three testicles.  I want to know who peed in his gene pool.  Later, while not even pretending to watch Dirty Dancing, we played with an exercise machine and started trying to play Girl Talk before I had to leave.
