Like we can't comprehend what the best thing to do in the situation is, when we planed or dreamed about for so long. Its there, where the truly brave come about. They acusally put the plan to the test or into action. Not when someone is just looking to get into another's pants, but in true love/like relationships. The people that you like the most are the easiest to be with but they are the hardest to exsplain your fellings toward them. Or its people that have been hurt from past relationships that have the hardest time taking chances with love. If your in a relationship were your with someone like that, its not that they don't really feel that way about you, its just that don't what to be rejected, or hurt again. But being introduced to true love has a feeling like no other. You feel like no one could get you down, no one could ever hurt you because that love is always there to give a supporting hand when you've lost all others. That love can act as extra legs to your table when you've lost the others( like friends or family that have died or abandoned you). Love is the strongest thing there is, it can also be the frailest. It needs to be supported by both ends of the bridge otherwise it collapses, under the stress that this world has. Love is also a very strong word it should never be miss used, if so many could fell the effect. So this is what love is to me, it is many things to many people but this is my interpretation of it.
