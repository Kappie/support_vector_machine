If you haven't heard, the Filipino truck driver taken hostage in Iraq afew weeks back urlLink was finally released , following the speedyremoval of the small Filipino force there. This is what the people of the Philippines wanted -- securityand peace, and their man (and all the troops)back home in one piece.  What if the boys in D.C. actually listened to their constituents? What a world it would be.
