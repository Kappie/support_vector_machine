Second, a bittersweet passage made quickly.  Moonshine  Let's run away tonight, all day at school Over the telephone Quiet, so that our parents won't hear us Let's run away tonight Before you move all the way across my world And I can't fall into the classroom Tripping over my own feet While looking at your eyes Tap on my window twice, take my breath I can run to the kitchen Take the small pack of oreos (It lies on the counter) And the little red flashlight in the cabinet There you are, creeping up behind me I turn and kiss you on your lips Like a breeze And take your smooth hand in mine Creep back through the open window The stars are frozen gemstones tonight Let's run away Before I find you running to the moon.   Night.
