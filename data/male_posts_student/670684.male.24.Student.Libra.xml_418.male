My time online is wholly devoted to job searches, as a dial-up connection doesn't leave much time for my usual grabass.   California -- good.  Doing some writing each day, relaxing a lot, back to where I wanted to be when I got out of school.  I know I can get a good job, and I'm lucky I've got some savings in case things don't work so quick.  I'd like to stay in Austin, but that's a bitch city to find work in.  California is nice but expensive, and Los Angeles sucks my ass.  San Francisco would be great, but I know no one.   The writing is good.  Great story I'm working on right now.   More blogging later.  I need to make it a habbit again.  It used to be an addiction, and that's when it was at its best.  We'll get back there.  Once I'm back to a town of wireless internet glory.
