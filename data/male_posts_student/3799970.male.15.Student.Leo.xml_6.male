Michelle and C-chan are my best friends(online)...I wish we could spend more time together...  So here's the deal...I'm listening to 1000 words...and all of a sudden...I feel the saddest I've ever felt in my life...  I dunno...I'm glad C-chan and Chelle are there though...they are fun to talk to and they made me feel a little better.  Mood-Depressed...kinda Music-1000 words...and other J-pop Quote- "Douka nakare riibu" (Translation-"Please don't leave")
