(In many ways, it is much like a return to the medieval era.) No other idea in classical theology has been impacted by this research than the doctrine of divine immutability. In the classic sense, immutability means absolutely immovable, unable to change in any way. Given Aristotle’s metaphysics, immutability seemed like a coherent divine trait. Perhaps even a necessary one. Nonetheless, this doctrine has been brought into question for two key reasons.  First, many philosophers find the notion of God being temporal to be convincing. If God exists in time, then he must undergo some change. For example, God’s knowledge of what is past, present, and future, would constantly be changing with each moment of time.  Second, a careful examination of the classical notion of immutability made it difficult, if not impossible, to reckon the God of the philosophers to be the same as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Joseph. If God cannot change at all, how does he have a relationship with us? How does prayer work? How did he become incarnate? The Bible seems to speak of God as a more dynamic being than just an unchangeable mover.  Of course, the Bible does speak of God remaining the same throughout the ages, and rejecting classical immutability does not mean one is left with a waffling God. Rather, I lean towards the proposal that God remains essentially the same in his character. In that sense he is immutable, which is why he is trustworthy. On the other hand, God is still able to change, but this ability to change never compromises his divine character. In fact, it is precisely because he can change in these ways that God is the awesome being that Christians can enter into a dynamic relationship with.
