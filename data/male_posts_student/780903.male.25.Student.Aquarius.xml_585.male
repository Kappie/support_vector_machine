I'm going to gather a bunch of the advice I've given about the beginning of law school (nothing on final exams, summer jobs, or any of that stuff is catalogued here -- just stuff useful when you start) on my weblog into one list, so law students who start school this month don't necessarily have to go wading through the archives (although I'd be delighted if you would go wading through the archives, I really would).  Here goes:   urlLink Some questions from 1Ls-to-be about law school stuff, and my responses    urlLink Lots more 1L Q    urlLink Advice on raising your hand in class and balancing school and life    urlLink Advice about getting useless advice from 2Ls and 3Ls    urlLink Stuff I wished someone had told me before starting school    urlLink Sarcastic orientation tips    urlLink Classifying the types of classmates you'll find    urlLink Mocking the assortment of journals you can join    urlLink What the Socratic Method is like    urlLink Study groups    urlLink Outlines and note-taking    urlLink On assigned seating   And, finally, when you think it's just not worth it,  urlLink Ramblings on why I like law school ,  urlLink Keeping it in perspective , and  urlLink My favorite song parody I wrote all year
