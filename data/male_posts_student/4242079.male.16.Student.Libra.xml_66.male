In so many ways, I want to just dissapear...not tell anyone where I'm going, just save up some money, and run away. Not forever though, no, just for a year. I'd like to live far away for a year, just start an entrie new life, not have to worry about everything that's happened over the past few weeks. I think Lethbridge would be the best, I'd still be able to get home if need be, but I could forget everything. And so I plot my escape. I save up my money, I bring up your hopes. Will they come crashing down? It's hard to say. I don't want to feel trapped like that. Perhaps two bedrooms.  Last night, Crystal went out with Skye, and I'm assuming JP, although she never mentioned his name. Good for them. I must say, it would make me more comfortable if she started seeing one of them, even if not seriously, than some kid I don't know. It's easier to feel resentment to someone you don't know. I remember the summers Skye and I spent together, he's a good kid.  I know I said I need some time to be single, but I can't ignore this feeling that keeps nagging at the back of my head. I need to find someone again, if that sounds desperate, then fine, I'm desperate. But I'm not. I don't want to find just anyone, I want to find   someone  . Some people may say I have it right in front of me, waiting for me, but as much as it pains me to say, I don't think it is. I'm sorry, but the converstation from last night, it still stands, you're always welcome.    music : Bright Eyes - The Difference In The Shades Bright Eyes - Tereza and Thomas Bright Eyes - Basketball Geoff Berner - Clown and Bard    I can't turn these songs off
