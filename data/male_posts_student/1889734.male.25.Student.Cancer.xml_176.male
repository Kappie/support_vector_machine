Just one quote worth noting:  Krugman: On the foreign policy front, this administration hyped the threat from Iraq, ignoring warnings from military professionals that a prolonged postwar occupation would tie down much of our Army and undermine our military readiness. (Joseph Galloway, co-author of "We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young," says that "we have perhaps the finest Army in history," but that "Donald H. Rumsfeld and his civilian aides have done just about everything they could to destroy that Army.")   Me:  We Were Soldiers was authored by two men.  General Hal Moore who commanded the troops in that battle, and Joe Galloway, a combat reported who flew into the battle zone after it had all started.  Funny how in Krugman's mind, the reporter's comments on the state of the Army are somehow authoritive because he sat on the General's knee and helped him craft the story into a nice piece of writing.  How about getting a real military man's comments?  What does Moore have to say about 'Rummy'?
