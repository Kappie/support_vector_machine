I'm not to disappointed cause I get paid to be here, watch the animals, water the plants, watch tv, and play video games.  Not a bad job at all.  Jen and Justin left earlier today to go back to Tahlequah for work.    The buddies are hard work, they wake me up at 6 am and tire me out playing games.  I like the after time though, when I get em tired, then they take a few hour break.  They are always getting up on the bed when I'm sleeping, and licking my face (not fun).  Well, that's about it for now.  See ya later and peace.
