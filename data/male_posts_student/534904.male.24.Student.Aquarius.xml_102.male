As in, it hurts so fucking much that it's painful to lie down to go to sleep, it's painful to sit up in bed, it's painful to stand up from a sitting position, it's painful to bend forward to pull my pants up or to tie my shoelaces, it's painful to lift one leg over the frame of my awesome new bicycle, and it's even painful to  ride  the damned thing. And to top it off,  urlLink Painkillers  aren't working, and I can't get a physiotherapist appointment for a week. I have to take a week, possibly more, off work.  Fucking fuck bloody fuck :madface:
