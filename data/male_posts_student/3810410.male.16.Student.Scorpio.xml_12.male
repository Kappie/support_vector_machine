If there is I want to set my world back to then When you came, changed me the way  The way that it felt to be alive  Six forty-five The day isn’t getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe  Phone is ringing, time to beckon some willingness to be What will occur? Or is this another call of someone just like me No amazement, just a dreading thread that pulls me into the web Am I just a little overdue? Cause sometimes I feel like I’ve been a little overused When will you come home? And can you change me?  Change me into the way that it felt to be alive  Six forty-five The day isn’t getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe Maybe I will just be ‘okay’  Interesting how it all turned out Seems to real to think that this is my life But they say that it’s not the end of the world Well it’s the end of the universe to me,  And I still don’t feel like I am alive  Six forty-five The day isn’t getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe Six forty-five The day isn’t getting older, just stays bleak I am so tired of this custom Maybe I will find you and it will all be okay Maybe Maybe Maybe I will just be ‘okay’ Maybe it might seem I am on the menu to start over yet again
