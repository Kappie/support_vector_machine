I know that the sight of a 20 foot long olds hurtling down Harrison with Ludacris blaring from the barely functioning stereo might appear strange. Look, I don't like it either. Im not a big fan off of driving around town with no air conditioning and no driver side window I might add, while I try to hide my face behind the steering wheel. I also dont like the fact that half of the steering wheel mysteriously peeled off on my way to work last week.  I hate the fact that there's a huge crack in the windshield, and every time I see it I am reminded of a big fat lady thats fallen over, what the?? Dont ask. I dont really like the fact that the car smells like wet dog, even though I don't have a dog? The fact that my cd player will only play a whole 2 cds that I own pretty much sucks as well.  Thats right 2 cds.  One is a ginuwine cd and the other is a burnt cd I made a long time ago.  Why it wont play anything else is a mystery to me. And, you know what makes all of this a million times worse? IT'S NOT EVEN MY CAR. Thats right. Its my dads old beater that im stuck with for the time being. Cant even call that bad boy my own. Meh whatever, Im just bitchin..I still pimp around in style dang it...in my own mind anyways. Maybe one day ill fix it up when I'm rich.  tip- She's not going to orgasm every time... Don't get down on yourself if she doesn't. If she doesn't orgasm from sex, offer to do oral. If she doesn't orgasm from that either, offer to let her masturbate and show you how to touch her. If she doesn't orgasm from that, then you might wanna give up. If a girl can't get herself off, then odds are, you can't get her off either
