Everyone talks about what a great New Years Eve party they went to, how fun it was, how "gloriously" drunk they got. I myself think its completely foolish. Maybe I'm losing faith in people, and maybe I don't care. Maybe there's one too many "maybes" out there that I really don't care to answer. Either way, I have to say that I am becoming more and more distant from society, and I don't see a damned thing wrong with it. People irritate me -- their habits, their mindsets, the way they try to have a conversation with me and end up holding it with themselves... its all building up, and one of these days I'm going to let someone know just what the fuck has been on my mind.  But until then, I'll keep the thumbtacks in my cheeks...  How else am I supposed to hold this smile any longer?
