If you are a spazzy yourself tell you're comrade to stop reading or if you're mum, dad, auntie or uncle or something is also stop so me and young Michael decided to go into Glasgow to pass the time til tomorrow, then he regails me with a tale of how these people at a campsite were playing with a frisbie and they have a disabled person with them who they try to incorporate into the game, however as he is a mongo the frisbie strikes him right in the face ahahahahahahaha I know it's no funny but it is really, it's hard to explain but just the thought of it ahahahahahah away again. And even before that on my way to the rendezvous with young Michael I came across a mother with her daughter who was about 7 standing about then out of nowhere the wee lassie gets fucked right in the head, so she hits her mum back, then the maw screams "You're a wee bastard and naebody likes you" ahahahahahahahahaha it was a classic, So in summing up I am a saddistic wee cunt. I got Ash's singles collection thing and it's ok the rest of the visit was spent broosing fat people's arses and laughing at them ahahahaha i think someone has spiked ma cha anyway.... and on top of all that we saw a cult-hero of ours known as Brawley, ahahahaha. So none of this is funny except to again characters of a certain dis-position. Then when we returned i got my sleepin bag and i witnessed the aforementioned pentium 4000bc in action that really is 633Mhz to young Michael made me a copy of The Libertines first album. Its quite good so far. Really good infact but can't go too hardcore too soon, and i don't like how the NME lick their ring. I've got nothing to do now just sit and think of this young invalid meeting his fate of a frisbie right to the dish. ahahahahah away again. Exam results in about 15-35 hrs dependin on the shiteyness of the post-man, who have been known to mow people down over here so don't give them any shit. I will write about that later probably i just had to write about the spazzy the now 'cos big ANN is in a mood and is threatening to withdraw the comp later cos it's makin a funny sound. ahahhahaha spazzy frisbie head - wee lassie naebody likes - big fat ring ahahahahahaha.
