Philosophy was three hours of laughing at amazing suspense at how little I actually know about philosophy. Half of the time I was staring at Ed beside me -happily completing the 6 pages for each paper - and I was happy too, staring at him was lovely considering just how awesomely cute he is (-:  Anyway, Saturday went well. Well I say well but this poor guy I know got stabbed in the back literally by Somalians - and he looked like the guy you can see if you go to the link in my name. I felt really sorry. Mind you if you throw huge black townies into Camden Lock - it is highly unlikely that you would come out in the long run un-scaved. Anyway the guy is now in hospital as far as I know and won't die at least . . .  Jo seemed funky, quite lively; but funky . . . . . . . . . . . erm oooh weathers nice hehe. Well if exurberance is your forte, then she's your type of lady. Ahh what am I saying, she's lovely really, and I can't wait to come see her again. I'm back into my favorite blogging place at the moment with the nicest keyboard your ever going to meet, and so I'm not making half as many errors whilst typing to you here. Hmmmmm maybe I could thieve it perhaps. It's just so soft and cleansing on my fingers, which could I guess be used for a nasty analogy if you have my two track mind - taboo's and sexual orientation (more than just one track eh Tammy).  Oh my as well, that football match almost destroyed my mental wellbeing yesterday. God how can anyone (never mind England) lose it after 92 minutes I'll never know. Well it's Switzerland on Thursday which we basically have to win to stay in it. Hopefully it will be a walk in the park but you never know with these things.  Not much really to do for the rest of the week except do some overtime if any were available to me, so I guess I'll just have to attempt a diet or something to keep my mind in full lubrication as it were. Well that or write. Or figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life once I discover the trio of E's in August. Well my dream career would being well paid to do this blog everyday. If only blogger cared enough to give me the chance - God knows how I'd love to entertain/piss of the masses. As my good friend Ian would say, it would be pretty "cool" - with an uninterested Daria type facial expression.  Currently the LRC is bare empty (for the love of good I couldn't think of a non-townieish term other than bare - I do apologize sincerely) with most people just on here to stare at the porn because they can't afford a home PC i.e pikeys  Anyway, unless something comes up in the next 10 seconds remotely meaningful to write, I'll have to say ciao. Oh darn it I can't think of diddle squat *sigh* xBuBzx
