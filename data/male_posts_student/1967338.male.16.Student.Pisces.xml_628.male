I swear if we could harness the endless energy of ten year olds we wouldn't need cold fusion.  But I'll survive. In other news, we had a Jekyll and Hyde blocking rehearsal today.  I'm a pickpocket and  I GET PROSTITUTES!   I know I'm a little too excited about it, but you have to remember I  was  the girl last time.  It's nice to have hot ones hanging on me. (Don't worry, Ash, you're still my #1 girl) Also, Rachel, you might be interested to know that Brad just got upgraded from 2 or 3 lines to one of the three largest parts in the show.  I am made of POISON!
