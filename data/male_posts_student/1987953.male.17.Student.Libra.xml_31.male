Toby Keith's song "Courtesy of the Red White and Blue" has never meant so much! I blared it at 7:00 this morning! Comment: Should we torture Saddam like he tortured many Americans and so many of his own people or should we be humane? Please explain. (Dude, I rhymed!) I'll tell you how I feel when I get a sufficient amount of comments. Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >    "Justice will be served and the battle will rage. This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage. You'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A.... We'll put a boot in your a**, it's the American Way!  Hey Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list. And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist and the eagle will fly and it's gonna be h*** when you hear Mother Freedom start a-ringing her bell and it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you! Ahhhh, brought to you courtesy of the Red White and Blue!" - Toby Keith, "Courtesy of the Red White and Blue (The Angry American)" from  Unleashed
