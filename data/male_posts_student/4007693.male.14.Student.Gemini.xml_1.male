Although the only known reason for this spontaneous request is that Zack finds Pearl to be a significant source of annoyance, the debate has been scheduled for this coming Monday.    The rules of the debate series are as follows:  1. Only Sir Zack the Rash and Lady Pearl of The-House-Next-Door-to-Her-Parents-House may be approbated to post in each debate thread (that is, unless Sam gets his usual urge to actuate his signiture phrase, "STFU dumass"; incorrect spelling and all). This rule will stay in effect until either of the following has occured: if each debatee (don't you love that word) has posted each of his/her two alternating posts; OR if Zack has banned Pearl. In the case of the first occurance, only the the three judges may post (although I am not sure what at the moment). In the case of the second occurance, Zack pretends that Pearl has forfieted the debate, and therefore wins.  2. Since Sir Zack is the challenger he gets, in his words "homefield advantage", which I believe means that Lady Pearl bats first, and that if Zack's ingenious plan somehow malfunctions and he misses the ball, Pearl gets to run around the bases. Then Zack gets to bat ... and hope that somebody will figure out why the heck he's playing one-on-one baseball, while they're supposed to be arguing about some random topic ... like why the chicken crossed the road.  3. Sir Zack: "If either Me or Pearl posts out of turn that's an automatic disqualification for that one debate." Translation: "If Pearl says something even remotely stupid, I'm banning her."  4. Now that we know the ground rules (a.k.a. the "Pearl-loses-no-matter-what" rules), we must discuss thoroughly the selection of topics. Topic one is to be selected by Sir Zack. Topic two is to be selected by Lady Pearl. Topic three is to be selected by Lord Timmy the Creator. Topic four is to be selected by Lord Jeff the User of Viagra. Topic five is to be selected by Lord Butters the Kind, Sensless, and Utterly Nonsensical. Topic six is selected by by yours truly. Just kidding. Topic six is  really  selected by a very selfish being who just happens to be the one carrying the honor of selecting the first topic.  5. The first person to win four debates (a.k.a. Zack), wins. (sorry, i forgot to put it in rule number 4).  6. The loser of this series of [fixed] debates  , owes (his)/her opponent something around 1,000,000 ep, and is banned for 3 days.    Topic  one has been chosen! it is... Dot! Dot! Dot!   RELIGION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     Thank you, and have a nice day.
