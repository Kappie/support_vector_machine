Place your hand in mine, I'll leave when I wanna. -Blink 182, "Feeling This"   the first day of school started kinda like i was expecting. ellen picked me up at 7:20 for the carpool. on the way i had a nervous twist in my stomach... kinda like constapation only less severe.  anyway, we got to school and i opened my locker. 2 - 96. i'd put my combo up here but there are some people reading this who i dont really trust... anyway, i went to my first class. Geometrey. we all stood outside, waiting for Mr. McConnell to show up. That's when I met christine. my first friend at soquel. She came from Holy Cross.. or maybe she got kicked outta there for not believing in god. Whatever, anyway, it was a lot of fun. i learned a lot about her and her fam. WOO HOO! she goes to hawaii every year!! cool beans! so our stubbly math teacher shows up and opens the door. he's already divised a seating chart, alphabetical order, and im stuck between alex baker and brett ackler. Now, alex is pretty cool. hes smart and all that. but brett.. brett stinks... literally... it's called deodorant. well we get our geometrey books and the lesson begins. my mind blanks and i look around the room... holy shit! im the only kid from shoreline! but wait, isnt that chris hastings.  ok, chris hastings, here's the deal.. in May i signed up to be in this intensive humanities course. The humanities academy. the orientation was in the soquel library, in May as well. i wore my spiffy cow boy outfit :-D! I met some cool people there... alec and emily. and, of course, tessa, tiana and kate were there. but back to the story.  so i see chris... and then we talk.. and he's a pretty cool guy. def someone i want as a friend. the bell rings and i look at my schedule... next stop, Piano.  well that was a boring class... i thought when i walked out of piano. all we did was fill out forms. stephanie hammond and ellen are in it with me.. ellen.. little did i know she was going to get way lame, way fast.  so next is my open. i head to the library and i sit down at a vacant table. then, a girl sits down. but not any girl.. it was spencer kaufman. one of the most popular girls at shoreline.  "hey.. brandon right?" she said. i nodded. then she looked at my schedule. "walter for pe..? always dress out and never chew gum. she said. we sat there quietly filling out forms that our A2 teachers handed out.  but pretty soon the bell rang for break.  i met christine and a bunch of other people at my locker. we all had relativley close lockers due to a mishap at orientation... ill get into that later.. anyway, for my first break i headed to my next class. History.. with Mr. Shonick.   i choose a desk next to christine, and pretty soon tessa, tiana, and kate come tortting in. we exchange hugs and "how was your summer?" and then they take seats near me. a bunch of other people come in. there's chris! and emily! oo and crystal! crystal and i have short convo and then she takes a seat next to me. well pretty soon this crazy guy with poofy hair walks in. class starts and we pretty much dont do anything except read and stuff.  the bell rings. my next class is PE.  i walk to the gym with christine and sit in the bleachers. our kinda chubby but happy looking PE teacher walks in. he calls roll and when it all done he gives us some forms. the guy behind me accidently kicks me. "sorry.." he said when i turned around. "hey, im jon luken.." this really skinny kid stares at me with a grin of braces. but whatever. he's cute. lol. we talk a bit but then its over and i head to lunch.  my first high school lunch! you noe what that means.. im going off campus :-D! on the way down with kalie and christine, i run into, GUESS WHO!! NATHALIE! nathalie and i became best friends over the summer.. and it wouldnt have been possible without the DC trip, but i'll get to that after the first day of school.. hmm maybe i should've talked about the summer first.  after buying soda and food at Hernandez, we walk back up the lazy trial (No way I'm going up Sucide Hill!)  English is next. we head back to shonick, cause thats what is says on our sheets, but he tells us to go to miranda. on the way i catch a glance from Alec! boy has he gotten hot over the summer. we fill out more forms in English. there's a lot to do, and we get new notebooks. chris makes a joke about my shirt, but its accepted. Ellen got me my shirt.. another summer story I’ll get to later.  anyway, after English I head to biology with tessa and chris. We have assigned seats and I end up sitting next to.. well.. a big hearted fat kid. Biology breezes by and im out of school. Ellen and I head down to the main parking lot to wait for my dad.   that’s when I saw him.  I was sure he was gay… but whatever the case I felt like I had to find out more about this boy. That’s when I first saw eben.  ok.. so that’s just the first day… there’s a lot more to talk about mainly the summer and stuff.. so yeah..  Later days :-D brandon
