Don't really want to talk about it much, which is ironic because, as a defense mechanism, I think, I talk way too much during a bad round of golf as a way of rationalizing the stress of poor performance. I started on the tenth tee today which was bad because I never had any idea how to play the tenth hole. So I just started by hitting my first drive OB. I never really recovered despite basically birdieing the hole with my second ball. A quad on the 18th right before the turn with two water balls hurt and made me turn in a 50 for the back side. I finally got something of a rhythm going on the second hole (my eleventh) after hitting a provisional for a lost ball but then finding it. The thing was that I just couldn't get the ball in the hole in par. I missed some fairways, but the fairways I did hit I missed the green on, or if I did in fact get a green (the fourth) I three putted. I missed a few short putts, but my putting total was lower, probably because instead of hitting the green but far from the pin, I miseed the green. The course was playing much tougher, I must say, because the tees were pretty much from the tips, and the wind was blasting hard. I really screwed up the par threes over water, doubling both. The eleventh I four putted from fifty feet above the hole (first putt long onto the fringe, second putter caught by rough, third missed, fourth tap-in), and the fifth I put my ball in the front bunker, took two shots to get out, and then two putted. It was very hot out there today, my shirt was wet and my hands too. One guy in my group fired a 78-73 to make it to the match play round of the tournament. He was one deep for the front nine, and had a chip in birdie to complement three bogeys on the back side. Props to a great course, great organization, two extra tournament rounds of golf, Ed Traines for firing a one over 72-73 to go to the match play portion probably seeded first. Anti Props (someone tell me the real word for these) for the bad greens, the lack of a driving range at the course, and the hot weather. PS My new two clubs are straightening out a bit
