HaHa!   Alright! First thing first! FFIX updates! So long never update le! Guess I am too busy, huh? Okay....I won the Tetra Master tournament! Surprise Surprise! I sucks at Tetra Mster...didn't expect to win. Okay...I drew the first round, so I get to go again. I won. Pure luck. Then, second round, I won again! Oh my!! I think I am getting the hang of this game. Then, I won the third round, against Erin the Oglop Master. She's easy! HaHa! Anyway, I went to get the Burman Coffee thingy. After that, witnessed few amazing FMVs (like Alexandar protecting the castle...cool!). I get to use Beatrix again! Cool! Now, I am at Lindblum. Yep!  Okay, I downloaded most of the songs in Wendy's notebook. Took about an hour or so! HaHa! They were very nice...very very nice! :) Some of the songs I couldn't download, and Wendy doesn't have....so wait till next time lor.   Okay...what is really interesting is that me and Ben decided to throw away all our Chinese materials. We were originally deciding to throw them into a recycling bin, down at Siva's block. BUT! BUT! It's gone! We have no choice....but to throw parts of them into various rubbish bins scattered around the area (we don't want to congest the bin ma). We were a funny sight. We chose to throw each worksheet by each worksheet, and saying out the names of the worksheet before throwing. We were quite a sight. Two kids were staring at us and laughing. Lots of peopled looked at us. HaHa! We finally completed our work at the rubbish bin down my block (where I threw away my 4B workbook). I gotta admit, it felt...shuang! Great! throwing away signifies the riddance of Chinese in our lives (at least, until A Levels)! YaY!   Okay, then later, I went down to MacDonalds in 768 to get Wendy's ViVi drawing. You gotta admit...her drawing is so nice! ViVi looks so real! Woah! I taped it to my closet doors (where other posters are). Even my brother and Edmund said Wendy's a great artist! Thanks Wendy!  Speaking of that idiotic neighbour! He is so damn qian bian! He comes to our house uninvited (why...he practically flew here after spotting my brother return from movie-seeing!!) and he demands the use of the playstation! Now!! I was playing FFIX that time and I wanted to watch Sabrina. I originally wanted to let him use at 6, after Sabrina. But! he insulted the way I played FFIX (I ran away from 2 and more monsters in a party....For goodness sake! I only had Zidane, and don't have that much patience to wait for the ATB guage to fill up to kill two or more monsters!)! I was so angry at him disrupting my game...so I decided to play FFIX at 6. I told him so when I was watching Sabrina....and he complained and became noisy. NOW! I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE TALK IN LOUD VOICES WHEN I AM WATCHING TV! I became more determined to use the PS at 6. After all, I live here. He doesn't. He has no rights to use the TV when I want to use. He then told me, "You are as selfish as your mother!" Now!! I am so gonna tell Mom about this! He's afraid of Mom...he never comes when she's home, mainly because she doesn't allow him to play the PS. Dad doesn't mind him at all. Mom is so right in not allowing him! Oh! He is so gonna pay, for disrupting my Sabrina-watching and insulting me and mother!  Okay...I gotta go now. Friends is about to start! See ya tomorrow, blog! Goodnight!
