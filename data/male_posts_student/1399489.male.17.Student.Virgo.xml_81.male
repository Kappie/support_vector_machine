It was such a good day to be outside working! it was a great sky, a great temp, and everything else.  it was even fun workin out there, we build a bunch of stuff and i build a very nice chair out of scrap wood it was funny lol even had a back to it.  there goes me and my building stuff again   :-)  Me and lauren and lee and quinten and bryndan were all havin fun all day, ohh and a old friend from nylc kimbrel was there from JA! then at about 3 45 they let of off there (which was ab an hr early) and me and bryndan cruised away with the windows down just chillin hahaha and i dropped him off at home went to go get some gas and vacume my car (with a broken gas station vacume that didnt suck like it was suppose to) whew sorry this is a long one.  but when i got home after that me and my dad went to go work out together up at the courthouse and we sat george, trent, alex, and faibanks all up there.  i messed around lifting weights with them for about a hour and then came home for 10 min and headed to get a haircut (which was way too expensive and not very good) and then that ends me where i am now, writing this thing after a nice long shower.  so yeah ive stayed busy but it has all been fun, now i just need to go call a few ppl and head to sleep after that.  no real school tomorrow either! we have the dresen exhibit yay!! ohh and im preforming in the stations of the cross on friday night at st richards at 5 30 if anybody wants to come up there im gonna be one of those mean guards lol.  ok well im off to use the tele lol and then prob be asleep b4 10 again (im lovin this goin to bed early thing) if you got this far in reading then your a good friend (or are incredible bored) lol and thank you :-)  buenos noches senors y senoritas.  Hasta mannana!
