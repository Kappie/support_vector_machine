This name was farmiliar to me, but I had no music by them on my hungry hungry hard-drive. So Ryan kindly pointed me to  urlLink their site , where I downloaded eleven, yes that's right, eleven free songs from their three albums. Great stuff. I suggest you go check it out immediately. They also have some awesome videos for you to watch and giggle with. They have a wonderful subdued energy that works so well with this current wave of awesome weather. I suggest you try the combo before time runs out and it snows again.  Ever since I took part in the  urlLink 24 hour comic challenge  down at Commuter Comics, I've been revamping my passion for the graphic novel. Yeah, that's what I call them now, because comics are for cocksuckers and little punks. Most recently I read "Paul Has a Summer Job" by Michel Habagliati. I found it in the school library and at first was doubtful, due to the dull idea of having a job. I was wrong though, this story is really well shaped, and really touching. It also has a lot of breasts and penises and fucks. Those seem to be recurring themes in ANY grpahic novel ever written. Earlier today I also bought a copy of "Canvas" by Alex Fellows. It's about a young girl and her friends as they discover, well, breasts and penises and fucks, go figure. I did enjoy it though, and am so proud to see my top bookshelf filling up with "damn cartoons". More than a couple days ago i bought "Heaven LLC" by Wayne Chinsang and Dave Crosland. My intention was purely to brighten my mood after getting a GAME OVER at a job interview moments before. What ensued was quite a trip, brought to you by, breasts and penises and the head of John the Baptists and fucks.   So I spent this Mother's Day at my dad's house, doing things my mom would never aprove of. Luckily, "we're not clebrating Mother's Day this weekend", so I have one more week to buy her a gift. Hopefully  urlLink Zack  can take me to like a Crate  Barrel or a Bed Bath  Beyond this week after school. I really want to get her something nice, but it's hard to save up money with all these failed job interviews and comics just  begging  to be purchased.   Coming up next, my thoughts on working hard for good/mediocre grades,  urlLink Zack  being a brother  and  a friend, breasts and penises and fucks, and so much more.  I keep hearing thunder outside, I hope it's thunder, and not a giant robot dragging is gargantuan legs accross my town. Pray for Mojo  and  Jono tonight.
