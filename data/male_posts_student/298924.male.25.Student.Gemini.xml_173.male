Ughhh...the Braves are gone from yet another postseason without a World Series ring....this looks like the end of the road for the great Braves teams as either Maddux or Glavine (and maybe both) could leave via free-agency....it was fun while it lasted....and even though we only have one ring to show for it, I couldn't be prouder to be a Braves fan!....anyone who has something negative to say is jealous pure and simple (except Yankees or Blue Jays fans)....  Well it's time to go be productive....
