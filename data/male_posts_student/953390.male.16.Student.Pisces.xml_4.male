I had to get some supplies for my AP summerwork (see -- 'a lot'), and I got 3 binders, 3 notebooks, 3 sets of dividers, and a set of slash pockets for my reports and PowerPoint CDs. Oh, and 2 of those  urlLink Pilot Pens that I love.  I also had a little stalker while I was there. While Mum went to go get groceries, I did my own little trip for my AP stuff. There was this guy who walked up in the binder/presentation sets aisle (at WalMart) and appeared to be looking for something; I had seen him earlier in the cat care aisle. I thought nothing of it, found the  urlLink binders I needed,  and left for the pens/pencils aisle. While I was there, he popped up in the paper/filing aisle. Looking at the paper and glancing at me. I still thought nothing of it and walked over to there to pick up some 90-Brightness Ink Jet paper (I like brighter paper -- the brighter, whiter; the better). I left then for the grocer's section to go to my mum. Then I noticed he was walking in the same direction as I. I then took notice and thought it a coincidence. Later I had to pick up some rock salt, so I went to do that, but I didn't know exactly where it was, other than near the fabrics aisle. So, I wondered around the (what I thought to be) the fabrics aisle, looking for the home-made ice-cream supplies. I saw him a few times, and was beginning to get really freaked out. I finally turned around one corner to find his face on the other side of the aisle, peering over the corner right beside me, looking at me! OH MY GOD DID I JUMP! I just said, 'Hello,' nervously and decided that this was one freak who thought I was guardian-less and saw me as his prey. I walked as fast as I could, pushing my cart, towards my mummy. He was following me a few feet behind. I finally got to the open area of the grocer's section and found my mother. I was pretty scared. Freak. I came home and Leonard said I got a parcel in the post. I didn't expect one, but it was  urlLink Microsoft Office:Mac 2004, Student  Teacher edition!  For my new eMac next week! YAY! Good ol' Grandaddy. He  did  order it for me! I asked him if he would get Toast for me at the same time I asked for Office, so maybe that'll come, too... I hope. I'm so happy!
