It opens next Thursday...and to put it simply enough, I can't wait. The problem is though, I'm faling English..prolly like by...two points..DAMN MY LAZINESS!....Ah, the struggle to bring my grade up by Thursday. This will be hell, I tell you. Hell.  Thirdly, Fridays are MY days. I get to go skating and see meh boyfriend. Anyone object? Din think so.  My favorite sin is Lust...but hell, I'm weird...talking about sins imposed on me by a different god..why do I get bored so damn easily?  I was in the gym and this chick wanted to beat me up. I ran way...I was on the treadmill.  I just got back from rehearsal. Do you know how rediculous it is to have rehearsal at 7 in the morning? I leave to go to school at that time. Damn the people who randomly make other plans. Damn them.  Beat-up, Dried-out Chicklet, Manders, Forever asleep.
