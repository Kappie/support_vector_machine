She's the biggest sweetheart and i feel that no matter what i do, i can never cheer her up, i try and help but it's as if nothing works, i'm there for her and i guess that's all i can really do. I love her to pieces and all i want is to see her happy, i want her to know that i'm always there for her, but it's hard when we rarely see each other. I hope that'll change soon though, as i'll be working my ass off on our friendship. anyways back to the topic at hand i love her i cant tell her the typical sad love story between friends, oh well we're good friends and that's what counts! I'm just confuddled about it all, she's amazing! anyways i'm oust i gotta think this over a bit more.
