I had block exams on Friday, and I'm pretty sure I got at least a B in all of them (80+ around here), and likely an A in 3/4 courses I hope.  Chemistry was the only thing that didn't go so well.  How did that happen?  Well, it was 100 questions, and some of them were ridiculously long.  Honestly, how the heck were we supposed to do like 40 calculations, as well as another 60 theory questions in 2 hours?!    News from our professor is that the entire class didn't do so hot.  I'm sure that I did ok, but damn, I'm realizing how easy it is for a professor to set a hard test around here (aka: screwing the class).  In terms of other tests, Histolgy and Neurobiology went fine.  Med term. was also a lot better than I anticipated.  500+ words in 2 weeks = not bad :)  So, no worries there whatsoever.  So with that, thus my first month here in terms of medical school. Only 2 months to go :)  Hrm, so right after exams, I came straight back to the dorms, and headed over to the ferry to goto St. Kitts with Rajan, Sophia and Sirhan.  The ferry ride wasn't long, and we arrived in St. Kitts at around 5pm.  We met up with one of Sophia's friends there who took us over to the Mariott Resort.  Holy $@#%!,  The place looked insane!  It's not as posh as the Four Seasons, but it was absolutely incredible!!  We looked around and enjoyed the sights for a bit, and then headed over to our room which was quite huge.  We rested for a short while, and then headed over to the Casino.  I don't gamble (yeah, many reasons for that..), but my friends did and they had quite a good time.  There were some big wins, and some big losses, but all in all, it was a fun experience.  After that little bit of fun, we went over to this restaurant Bobbsy's with Sophia's friend for a party with the local med students.  The atmosphere there was very different from Nevis, and students there just seemed like they were all enjoying themselves.  There are obvious caveats with that considering Windsor's reputation, so to make it simple, party schools don't really make good medical schools.  Anyhow, after that, we headed back to the Mariott to their club Tiger's.  It wasn't too bad as it was where the afterparty took place.  Sirhan and I played some of the local students in pool, and simply put, Sirhan kicked their asses with a little bit of help from me, lol.  So that was that, we eventually got back to our room at 3am or so.  It was a fun day, but even as I'm writing this, I felt that something, or rather someone was missing :(  You know who you are, and I really wish you were there.  :(  The only thing that sucked today is that we had to return our car.  We left the car at the docks with the window's open, and the owner pretty much got ticked off when he saw it and wanted it returned.  Yes it is a very small island, and the locals seem to know everything that is going on.  And yes, me being me, said to put up the windows when we parked it and my friends said to not bother with it.  Lesson learned, oh well.  Ok, time for bed.  Bye.
