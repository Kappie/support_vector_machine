Sixteen years ago, I had my first experience of erm.. how should i say it.. first experience of getting into contact with the air outside my mum's womb perhaps. IT'S MY 16TH BIRTHDAY!!!~!~!~ WOOHOH. Okok.. no big deal. Now I'm sixteen years old, guess i have to be more responsible(I've always been a responsible good boy), more obedient, more hardworking, more ... ... Study harder and live life to the fulLest~!~ Thanks peny pwincess for the Bon Jovi cd. And I'm glad she didnt buy some other CD for me.(The case just cracked when I opened it. I don't know why, but i guess it has been left on the shelf for quite some time.. hhaha) Hmm.. I'm still waiting for SOMEMORE presents and also hong bao from my parents? Ten years down the road I will tel her what my wish was if my wish comes true la! Ten years down the road.. it's a long long... pass her my diary book as well..  .a  birthday with neither birthday cake nor red eggs .my wish better come true! Cos i made it at 12am sharp yt.â„¢~
