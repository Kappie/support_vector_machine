Have you guys noticed anythin' different about this site?  Heheh yeah, you should man, cuz we started puttin out those pics of ourselves.  We still haven't got the pic thing down to a fine point, but  "Operation: Change"  is really still underway.  We have done the logo thing and we've stayed true to our plan for new quotes every week.  So, I would say that  "Operation: Change"  has been makin' extremely good progress!  Anyway, this is just an update blog, though I'm sure  Nick  had already informed you about the change and all.  Anyway, I will blog some more later and try not to forget my obligations to  this blog  and the  P.R.E. !
