BLAH. that's exactly how i feel sometimes. what do i mean by i feel BLAH? i'm sure you know that feeling. its definitely undescribable. the simplest (and only) way i can put it is in terms of BLAH-ness. i'm not very good with slang  etc. so dont mind me much. i think its also known as JADED. can't be too sure though you know? well let me see. i guess i can start by explain what BLAH is to me. well, it's when i feel not happy but not sad. i dont feel good but i dont feel bad either. i dont feel like dying but i dont feel like living. its right smack in the middle of all the opposites. the only way i can think of saying that is BLAH. like i'm sick of everything and there's nothing.. NOTHING i can do about it. it sucks QUITE a bit but hey.. what can i say? well anyways..   sports bum 55: i'm so very tired of life, that i've given up on it sports bum 55: i've decided i'll just go through the motions sports bum 55: and whatever happens happens  i dont feel like writing right now cause i'm sleepy. so maybe tomorrow   meily has officially given me a hella worry
