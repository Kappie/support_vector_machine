As I was walking to my Religion, Health, and Mortality class, I saw a guy in short sleeves and shorts standing at the bus stop, using a small parasol to try to deflect the sleet.  He was utterly miserable.  I couldn't help but laugh...this guy is literaly stabbing at the sky, trying his best to keep his fair skin free from the cold shards of condensation surrounding him.  He saw me laughing, and he started laughing as well.  Good for people seeing humor in their idiocy!  The guy behind me in the computer lab does not share such inklings of humor.  He's playing some online game that looks like a cross between Legend of Zelda, Civilization III, and Killer Clowns From Outer Space.  The lab is packed; people are waiting for the sleet to stop (as Tripper Clancy told me today, in his best Harry Carry voice [not near as good as mine], "If the weather's bad in Austin, wait 10 minutes!"  That's the ticket!), and there is a huge line to get a computer.  But this guy is using the school hub to play this game.  I've been watching him since coming in...he just saw me look, and in order to show his superiority over his alien race, he just killed one of his subservients to flex his 64 bit muscles.  WOOT!    Nothing personal, but the blog is boring the shit out of me atm.  What else can I say about war?  My righteous indignation can only go so far.  When can I get back to talking about cute puppies?
