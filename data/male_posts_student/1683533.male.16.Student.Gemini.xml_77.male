Goto a church of my choice  Uhm...something is missing...how about...  NOT GOING TO CHURCH ??  SHE ALREADY KNOWS HOW I FEEL ABOUT GOING TO CHURCH.  I don't like catholicism, I don't believe in going to church.  I don't need a church to pray, or know there is a god.  I have my own beliefs.  So, I left her a message on my door:   "Don't wake me up!  If you force me to go to church, you are not only unconstitutional, but you will also be disregarding my beliefs!"   Hopefully she will notice it and leave me alone.  I haven't gone to church in a long time, and I plan on keeping it that way.  Yes, it would be unconstitutional for her to make me go...it's called  freedom of religion , mom...I don't really have a set religion.  I just know there is some dude up there that is controlling things....and according to one of my counselors i went to,  that is all i need .  So, I hope my mom just leaves me alone.  Or  I am gonna have a fit.   "It's not like I don't believe in Jesus Christ, it's just I care about other things." -NOFX
