The area hasn't been keep too well, and the tiny pixie disappears among the foliage except for the tips of her wings. You see them twitch slightly, a sure sign that she is ready to begin. Destiny reaches into her sack for a sheet of paper and her trusty paintbrush. She chews delicately on the end, trying to decide on the best way to start this duel. Her eyes light up as it comes to her. Her paintbrush begins flying over the paper, hands moving as if with a mind of their own. She giggles softly as she knows this is probably most predictable for her, but it wouldn't be a duel for the little pixie without her precious. As her fingers add a few last details to perfect the drawing, she glances in Tivon's direction, hoping the serious mage appreciates her artwork. She reaches into her pouch at her waist, retrieving a tiny handful of the pixie essence that gives her the power to work her magic. Sprinkling it gently upon the artwork, she covers it entirely, then balls the paper up. She gives the ball a little heave, and you watch as it easily covers the distance to Tivon, landing a few feet infront of him. This pixie has a mighty powerful arm! As you watch ball land, it begins to unfurl back to its original flat shape. A few moments pass, and you begin to think the poor pixie's magic must have fizzled. Poor pixie. Then a sound reaches your ears. It sounds like a trumpet, but it couldn't be, as trumpets in themselves are not very dangerous items. Your eyes stay glued to the paper, knowing that this is the source of the sound. Suddenly, a pink tube rises from the white, rectangular hole. It twists this way and that, almost as if scenting the air. You shake your head in disbelief, and close your eyes. When you open them, there before you is a massive elephant. And not just any elephant, a big, pink, fluffy one! It lets out a loud trumpet, bellowing its fierceness. The elephant looks around the clearing, wondering who she has been summoned to destroy. A little voice floats on the breeze, calling out, "Tivon, serious mage." The pink beast seems to nod, eyes finding Tivon and staying glued on him. Ele begins to bounce on its bum, a sound that can only be taken for a padoderm chuckle emitting from its snout. She moves toward her target, her arse large and in charge, intent on smooshing Tivon into....a mage-like pancake....or crepe....or just really flat thing....  Tivon doesn't wait for Destiny to get into position, he begins his strategy instantly. Pulling a small, white orb from his robe he holds it up in front of himself. He looks at it lovingly and it seems that he must have a strong bond with this thing. He throws the orb at Destiny, it seems Tivon must have a strong arm as well. The orb flies through the air and unsuspectingly multiplies as it soars at her. The thousands or orbs seem to shrink as the fly, turning pixie sized. The continue right through Destiny, each one zipping through her. As they come out it can be seen that they are no longer white but have a multitude of colors swirling inside of them. They return to Tivon, passing into his body. As they do they transfer the stolen magic to his body, filling him with power. He grins knowingly, now understanding Destiny's specialty. He awaits her attack and when Ele starts to come for him he decides to put this new magic to test. Tivon Stilfles a laugh as Destiny continues to refer to him as the "serious mage", but focuses as he begins the spell. Not having any paper on hand he picks up a piece of bark from amist the garbage around the pond and draws on it with a quill he retrieved from the folds of his robes. He does not produce any pixie dust, but omany orbs flow out from his again, all still swirling with colors. One in particular moves over the bark and a powder drops from it. As it does so the colors begin to fade inside the orb. Tivon tosses the bark out in front of him and waits to see what happens. A tiny squeak sounds over the pond, but the noise that Ele is making drowns it out. Just as Ele comes close to Tivon a tiny mouse scurries up the elephant's side. As soon as Ele sees the mouse it lets out a loud toot! and takes off across the field and through the gorge. Tivon points to Destiny and the mouse, which had lept from Ele before she ran, moves towards her. As it comes into range of Destiny it can be seen that this must be what Tivon drew, it is no normal mouse. The mouse lunges at Destiny, seeming much like a tiger or wolf to the tiny pixie. In the air it opens it's mouth revealing fangs. This must be a vampiric mouse!  Destiny blinks as the tiny orbs pass through her, a rare seen expression coming to her face. A frown pulls at her tiny lips as her hands unconciously fly up to cover her tiny frame, a feeling of violation quaking her little body to its core. She trembles at the exposing, and glances down to make sure she isn't left naked. Her thoughts leave her Ele, as she tries to regain control of this situation. She glares at the theiving mage, realizing she will have to be her worse opponent now....herself. She sees her precious depart out of the corner of her eye, but her attention is trained on the fuzzy creature heading her way. As the mouse makes its leap, Destiny pushes off the ground, flittering up into the sky to get away from little creature. She shudders slightly at the sight of the vampiric rodent trying to leap and sink its vicious little fangs in her tender skin. The little pixie knows she must destroy this abomination, and reaches into her sack for a pre-drawn picture of a toothpick. Adding a bit of her sparkly dust, the paper disappears and leaves her with a pixie-size stake. Working quickly and deftly, she plunges down toward the mouse, thrusting the toothpick at its little heart. It squirms a few moments, in its last death throes, as the pixie wipes a tear from her eye. She hates to bring physical pain, or death, to such soft and cuddly creatures. She takes a deep breath to steal her nerve, knowing she may have to do it again very soon. She spins around to face Tivon, a scowl forming on her tiny features. She reaches into her sack, her eyes never leaving the mage, and retrieve a clean sheet of paper. Her hands begin to work their magic yet again, covering the sheet with a seldom used picture. As she adds the last line to her artwork, she reaches into her pouch for more of her pixie dust. Apply a liberal amount to the paper, a little POOF! is seen. As the cloud of...stuff....clears, you see the little pixie, which you know you should. What you don't expect to see, but can quite clearly, is a large mouth floating beside her. She crosses her arms over her chest as the mouth open to reveal razor-sharp, revolving, metallic teeth. It emits a sound similar to a blender, which is an item not found in this world but is used to liquify food. The crazy mouth clomps it teeth a few times, sparks flying from its deadly dentures. With a barely perceivable nod of the pixie's head, the mouth shoots forward. It's target? Tivon. It's intent? Well, that is too gruesome to describe.....  Tivon watches Destiny stake his poor little mouse and waits for her next attack. While waiting he searches around and finds a few more pieces of bark. As soon as he sees the mouth he giggles and cringes at the same time, the mouth a funny sight while still extremely dangerous. He begins to draw on his piece of bark, working quickly. He is done drawing soon, he must have drawn something simple. Another orb releases its magic on to the bark. This one Tivon throws directly at the oncoming mouth. As it flies through the air it makes the transition from a piece of bark to a metal pipe. The pipe soars into the mouth, sticking right inbetween two of the teeth. As the pipe gets more twisted and stuck in the teeth they slow down, the whole mechanism jamming. Tivon begins to furiously scribble on the next piece of bark, drawing wildly on it, he digs deep into the caverns of his imagination. Again, another orb releases it magic and Tivon tosses the orb at Destiny. Coming up right off the piece of bark a ghastly ghoul floats upward, looking like nothing more than smoke, but a figure within a cloud of smoke. It floats at Destiny with one hand stretched outward. As it moves towards her the air temperature around Destiny drops, cooling down. No one can know for sure, but the ghoul gives off the impression that it is reaching not for Destiny but for her very soul, threatening to steal it from her very body. Can anybody live without a soul? Maybe, maybe not. The ghost moves within grasp and plunges his large hand at Destiny, he moves to pass his hand right into her chest.  Destiny scowls yet again, possibly a new look for her, as she watches her opponent mimick her own movements for a second time. As she watches the mage prepare to attack her vicous mouth, she prepares for her next defense. Reaching into her pack for a new sheet, she holds her paintbrush ready. As her mouth is quickly defeated and Tivon begins a new picture, the little pixie grabs a handful of her pixie dust to use once her own picture is complete. As the bark is thrown and the transperent evil soars in her direction, the little mage can only blink at first, feeling the dropping in temperature. Her paintbrush begins to fly over the paper, almost before Destiny realizes she has begun to draw. In a matter of seconds, the picture is complete and the pixie dust is administered. The paper disappears and a man of the cloth is left in its place. The priest begins to chant words of priestly things, quickly excersing this demon. The ghoul begins to fade as the priestly fellow chants louder and faster. As the ghost reaches Destiny, it fades completely from sight, passing not into the little pixie, but into the next life. The pixie sighs, wiping sweat from her brow caused by the close-call. She graciously thanks the priest, accepting a rushed communion, before sending back to his church. She dusts her hands together, grinning slightly at the turn of events. She quirks a delicate brow in thought, wondering what would be the best next attack. You almost see the lightbulb appear over her head as an idea strikes her. She reaches into her sack, knowing she has a picture already drawn of this next creature. Her fingers fly over her artwork, finally locating the right one. Her grin grows brighter as she reaches for her magical powder. The tiny pixie grabs a pinch of the stuff, knowing little will be needs, and sprinkles it on her artwork. She quickly folds the paper into triangle shaped object and gives it a toss. The paper floats on the air, landing near Tivon, but more importantly, near the trees, garbage, and bark he has been relying so heavily upon. As it lands on the ground, the paper vanishes, leaving a very large, very mean looking dragon in its place. The dragon sneezes once, a little pixie dust caught up its nose, and fire shoots out of its snout, covering the wooded area in flame. It sneezes again, covering the garbage and bark as well. Soon the area is a light with the fire, destroying any items to be used to draw on, and making an escape route quite dangerous, if it would even be possible. The pixie flutters up above the inferno, and waves cutely to Tivon. She gives a high-pitched whistle, and the dragon turns his fiery eyes on his target. It begins to lumber toward Tivon, snorting flames from its mouth and tossing its tail back and forth to black its back. Tivon better hurry.....or he could be......flambayed.....or at least burnt-crispy....  Tivon blinks as the big dragon turns his resources into ash. Luckily, Tivon pulls a few thistle leaves from his sack. Not exactly bark or paper, but they will do. He quickly sets to drawing before the dragon turns to him. At first his mind is filled with the image of a knight, probably the best thing to kill a dragon, but before he draws one he gets a great idea. He finishes up his drawing and coats it with magic from an orb, then tosses the leaf on to the ground in front of him, then turns and backs away. His leaf poofs! and bam, there is a dragon standing there. This is no mere dragon, this happens to be a golden queen dragon. She takes off over the mountains and Destiny's dragon, a typical male, takes off into the sky wanting to impress the lady dragon. Tivon flashes a grin to Destiny and thinks over what he should draw last. Tivon grins, a great idea filling his head. Destiny's imiginary light bulb pops over Tivon's head, such a great idea it is. He draws slowly, taking his time. One of the many orbs releases its magic over the leaf before Tivon drops it. Up from it come many little pixies, all grinning and fluttering, like nice little pixies. All of them are female pixies but one. They take off and zip over to Destiny, all the girl pixies immediately begin to do her hair, put make up on her, all girly type things. The male pixie hovers a few feet away, a most studly pixie, he must be a prince or something. It seems the other pixies think Destiny a princess or something. The male pixie flutters up to Destiny and takes her hand in his, softly applying a kiss to it. He flashes her a sexy smile and says, "Come, lets go have some fun. Forget this duel, you do not wish to fight, do you?" As he speaks one of the female pixies reaches for Destiny's paintbrush, trying to inconspicuously remove it from her grip.  Destiny watches Tivon closely, almost able to see the light bulb appear. She grins to herself, knowing the joy of the great idea. She watches as the mage pulls out some leaves, and shakes her head realizing her magic is all he knows now. She can't help but smile as her male dragon is typical to his gender and departs after the pretty female. She waves quickly to him, hoping he behaves himself, then turns to her opponent. Her jaw drops as she sees the multitude of pixies heading her way. Her grin is broad and bright, having seen so few of her fellow winged creatures as of late. She allows them to primp and pamper, too happy to realize they could mean her harm. She giggles and twirls, showing them their handy-work. As the gorgeous male approaches, she is at a lost for words and thoughts. But something keeps nagging in the back of her head. She worries her bottom lip trying to remember, as her eyes stay glued to the pixie god infront of her. She extends her hand to him, blushing slightly at his words. As she is about to nod, she feels a tiny hand reaching for her other, paintbrush wielding hand. She blinks, and turns to the little pixie girl who would dare to retrieve her brush. She glowers slightly to the little imp, shaking her head disapprovingly, as pixies never steal from their own kind. The offending pixie is so ashamed to be caught in such an act, she flutters off quickly. Destiny turns to the male pixie, frowning at his intentions. The male pixie too is embarassed for what he helped to do, and gathers up his harem for a quick retreat. As they disappear from sight, Destiny turns her eyes on Tivon, flashing a brilliant grin. "Aye, thank goodness that is over. Please give me my magic back. Oh, and a good duel, if I do say so myself. *giggles*"
