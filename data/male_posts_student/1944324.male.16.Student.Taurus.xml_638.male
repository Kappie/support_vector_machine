For those of you who have read Night Watch-- I just reread it, and I'm wondering:  (two things now, actually, one of which is why this stupid thing won't let me press the "enter" button) Was Lady Roberta Messerole of Genua, aka "Madam", aka Vetinari's aunt, a seamstress (hem hem)? And exactly what part was she playing in the assassination of Lord Winder and his replacement with Lord Snapcase? And, subsequently, what was her role in Vetinari's ascension to the Patricianship? In short what sort of... business... did she have in Ankh-Morpork? If this goes well, I have other questions about things like Gavin from The Fifth Elephant and Lady Margolotta and Angua's family and Ysabell and Albert and Binky. That last sentence would have been a different paragraph if the enter button would work, but it won't.
