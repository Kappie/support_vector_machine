I was hoping to have a pictures page up and running today. But instead I got side-tracked with making a page for all of my CD's and everything. Then I decided to open my big mouth about making a database on my  urlLink Where's George  stuff. So now I have someone talking to me about php, asp, and all this other jazz so that I can make a database. But I dont even know any php (or any of that other crap) (I barely know HTML). So I am in a mess.  Jadie is going to Kennedy park with her family for something today.  That is where I went and looked for the  urlLink Geocache  yesterday. Ya never know. Maybe Jadie will find it and put something inside. But I wouldn't bet on it. She probably wouldn't want to walk to the opposite side of the lake for that.
