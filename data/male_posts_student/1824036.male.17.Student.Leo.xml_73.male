I get into the shower room and our shower (being in the basement of an older type house) is infested with a TON of crickets. I managed to mangle, poison, and beat most of them to death with either my bare hands, some cleaner that shouldn't touch bare skin (it has a skull and crossbones on it) and/or a broom. I finally get showered and call Jadie.  I spent most of my day loafing around at Jadie's house. We went out to eat at Lomita's Mexican Restaurant, then bought some paint for our model car. We get back to Jadie's just in time for her to say..."I'm Hungry." So we go to Casey's Gas Station where we get ripped off. (bought something and they lady rang it up about 80 cents too much) No Biggie. Then I dropped her off at volleyball and I went to football.  Tonight I went to some Hunter's Safety Course. It was from 7-10 and I would consider myself lucky that I grew up around guns, because if I had not I wouldn't understand a thing the moron's that are running the course are talking about. But we learn safety, laws etc., different types of guns, and more. Its nothing too big. And its a little boring. But I will live.
