It was from  urlLink Keenspace All Stars , a website devoted to "acknowledging the best of Keenspace," to quote the site.  Interestingly enough, Crooked Halo was one of the comics on their list for the month.  I have no idea who nominated or voted for me, but I'm very, very honored.  I'm in the company of such Keenspacers as  urlLink Count Your Sheep ,  urlLink The Jaded ,  urlLink Mixed Myth ,  urlLink Fallen Angel Used Books , and  urlLink Reasoned Cognition .  Anyway, for those of you reading this (you probably also read the comic, I'm assuming), thanks for reading Halo, and I'll try to maintain a level of quality that deserves such recognition.  In other news, I got an old Phil Collins album on CD today.  It's  No Jacket Required , which was one of my favorite tapes when I was younger.  The album's chock-full of great tunes that I know by heart and still remembered, even though I haven't heard most of the songs in years and years.  I remember when that tape was part of my usual musical regimine.  The other tapes were Collins'  Face Value  (another great album), Tom Petty's  Full Moon Fever ,  Into the Great Wide Open , and  Damn the Torpedoes , Led Zeppelin's  ZOSO  ( Led Zeppelin IV , the one that had weird symbols for the title), the two Traveling Wilburys albums, and the Black Crowes'  Shake Your Money Maker .  These were the albums that I constantly listened to until I got a CD player and CDs.  When I wasn't listening to those tapes, I was in the living room listening to dad's records.  He had lots of great stuff--Beatles albums, the Eagles, Electric Light Orchestra, solo stuff from the former Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and others that I can't even begin to remember without going back in and looking at them.  Granted, I mostly just listened to the Beatles records...the number of times I sat there with  Help!  or  Sgt. Pepper's  filling the headphones and my ears are too many to count.    So all in all, it's been a good day.  My run today was good--it took me about half an hour to run around my neighborhood and then around campus, so that's roughly 3 miles or so (because that's about how long it should take me to run three miles, even if I'm running a 10 minute mile, which I think I'm moving faster than that).  Also took Ev up to Circuit City in OKC to exchange a DVD player that didn't work, and that worked out well for him (they gave him store credit, which was better than what I thought would happen--I figured they wouldn't even let him exchange it period).  All told, life is pretty good, and could be much, much worse.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Phil Collins, "Inside Out" (it was always my favorite song on the album)
