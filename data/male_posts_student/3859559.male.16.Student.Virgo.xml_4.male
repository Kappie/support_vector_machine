I thought about her for a year about all the things we could do together. When I came back everything was great for a while. Then the hard times came and we just let go one after the other thinking the other would hold on. I just wish I hadknown thatshe was letting go so I could have caught her hand, but time passes and people change I guess we both did and were hoping we hadn't. I know I would have changed a few things now, but I guess I had my chance now she will move on as I should. We will pass in the halls and exchange akward glances and not whisper a word to the other. In our minds though we will think of times past by. I will always remember you for the you that was what I fell for in my heart and hope that someday we can talk about the good old times. I know what people think though because I have been in the others shoes. Now remember me for me and I will do the same for you.
