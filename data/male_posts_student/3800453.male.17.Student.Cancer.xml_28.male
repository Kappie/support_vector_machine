Memories by Matt Wagner  1 They say your first love always hurts the most and now I know that isn't just a joke I knew a girl when i was 15 years or so she was the only love I'd ever known.  2 I met her at a concert on a hot sunny day we laughed and we talked and everything was ok When the stars came out I would hold her tight and we'd rock and we'd sway for the rest of the night  (chorus) Isn't it great to be loved by someone? Well, if you lost that someone just remember this song and the memories you shared with that person who cared but then something went wrong and you were lonely and scared  (music...)  3 We used to sneak out and we'd stare at the sky to see if any shootin stars would fly by. It's memories like those that I'll never forget, I wish I could go back to the day we first met  4 (slower) I saw you with him the other day and I tried but I couldn't keep the tears from my face I hope that he's the best in the world because your still my favorite girl  (chorus) Isn't it great to be loved by someone? Well, I've lost that someone and I've written this song about the memories that I shared with that person who cared but then something went wrong and my hearts lonely and scared  (music...end)
