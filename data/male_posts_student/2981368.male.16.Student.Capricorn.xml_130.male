Though that looks like a Union Jack. WRONG FLAG, IDJETS!    Mexico 1970 - "Juanito" Fat Mexican kid with oversized hat. I will say no more.    West Germany 1974 - "Tip  Tap" Strange looking rosy-cheeked Germans. Kinda deformed.    Argentina 1978 - "Gauchito" Strange kid that makes me think of Popeye. *shudder*    Spain 1982 - "Naranjito" Erm...its an orange. A fecking peice of fruit.    Mexico 1986 - "Pique" I don't know what the hell that thing is meant to be. But it has a cool hat. And is much better than the other Mexican mascot.    Italy 1990 - "Ciao" Wow. Lego really out-did themselves this time.    USA 1994 - "Striker" What a crap name. And look at it. I swear I've seen that dog on some crappy cartoon before.    France 1998 - "Footix" Its a French bird. In a blue jumpsuit. With a rubbish name. What were they thinking...    Japan / Korea 2002 - "Kaz, Ato and Nik" Now these guys have style. But they're also kinda scary...wouldnt like to meet them on a dark night...it'd blind you or something. Still, better than most the others.  So, there you have it. 2 remotely decent logos in about 40 years. Woohoo!
