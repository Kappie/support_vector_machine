There's also no reason to stay. I wonder if I left, if anyone would care besides my parents. And I wonder if anyone would want to come with me...  Anyways...I feel so free. I want to just leave, take my stuff, and go. And unpack in the first really kick ass town that I find myself in. Like some place at the beach. With hot girls. And a really big video gaming community. A place where fireworks are legal. And even the cops find themselves breaking the law. A place where you can do what you want and no one would care. Sounds like a 3rd world country, doesn't it? Heh, right now, I wouldn't care where the hell I had to go to find a beach, hot girls, fireworks, and a place where I could do what I want. But of course, I'd have to pick up a few friends before I went there. I'd have to pick up eek, and Grimes. And we'd all bring our xboxes, and we'd be happy. Once we got there, we'd find some really hot girls. And become street performers and put on shows for tourists. And they'd be rich tourists and they would throw like huge stacks of money to us after our show was over. Then we'd all go buy fireworks, and play xbox all night. And drink Bawls. Ahh...Sounds like the life eh? And as for our shows, we could be like, pirates (since were at the beach, it sounds appropriate, eh?) and sword fight and one of us could always die (like Kenny in south park) and be dragged off and eaten by a monkey (that could be eek) and we would be sword fighting for a chest of something. And the one guy left could open it, and it could be full of...bananas...So then eek comes back as a monkey and knocks out the dude with the chest, and steals the chest away. Then our performance would be over. Funny, huh?
