WHAM!  random didyouknow fact. -  MENTOS LOWERS YOUR SPERM COUNT.  but not that i need it or anything. At the moment. doh.  so we had the usual boring olfriday, but no so boring at times when you're looking forward to earlier dismissal. double physics triple maths and double chemistry. bummer. yes i know. went to jam with jem and shawn. hmm, sounds catchy, jam with jem. - and i found out how much i need to work on my drums. dont look at me like that kel. drums, percussion, you know, snare, cymbals, crash, ride, bass. not my teabags goddamit. was developing a cold by then, sorry couldnt make it for lunch dan. came back, i crashed on my bed and slept till 6++...and my tutor came in my house herself, cos exodus was playing too loudly on my com and i couldnt hear the doorbell. i swear if i my legs was about 10cm more to the right "it was on the table" she could have seen my manhood. no i was wearing boxers. i didnt even know she was coming.but the good part was that i only had tution for an hour cos i was sneezing and sucking endlessly..........on lozenges.   i have the sudden urge to watch spiderman again.  oh yeh, before i end this post, i have to tell u guys about my dream.  i dream that i was in Natsok's (or rinchen) store with kel,cept it was in some ulu ulushopping centre,*slapsforehead* the store is already in aulu place,but its not the one at funan imsure.so heleft and asked me to take chargeofhis store. kelsuddenly disappeared. and i wasselling spiderman figurines and merchandise, along with some other randomstuff that i forgot. so i sold a67-point of articulation spidey to this woman, and she paid30 bucks for it. which i wasproud of. and there were other people too,some just walking in, taking a look around,the occasionallytake sweet and leave (there weresweets on the counter) . after that i found out that the spidey thing was worth 40 bucks, and i got like fooled. DOH~ what a weird ass dream. but it doesnt beat the one where i dream i was riding on whales. like  FREE WEINER.  i mean,  WILLY.  heh.
