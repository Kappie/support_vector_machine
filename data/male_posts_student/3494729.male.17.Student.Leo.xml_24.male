Why do people pay $1.99 for gas, when, in clear view down the street, there's a gas station with gas for $1.89?  Do you think someday the whole political correctness thing will get so out of hand that people will complain that in a deck of playing cards, all the face cards are white people?  Why do cops tailgate you? Are they just taunting you like "haha, yea, just go ahead and break 45, sucker"?  Isn't there kind of a small ethical dilemma when someone gives you a burned copy of a CD they payed for?  Are you annoyed by all my quasi-rhetorical questions?  Who else is disappointed that all the really cool things have already been invented? (sticky notes, pizza bagels, etc.)  If people were never introduced to the concept of violence, would they discover in themselves on their own?   -alex
