But anyhoo I had nothing to do so I started this 'blog', lord knows if I will still be interested in it tomorra (which is infact today) but stay tuned to find out.    Im on holiday from college at the moment, 12 weeks off with nothing to do but write stuff on here. I was at my cousins today tho playin guitar, and then I was talkin to friends online (including Nicki who I happen to have a crush on, but shhh!). My friend Abi left for France about 3 weeks ago, nd I really miss her, shes really good to talk to (although the girl has bad taste in music, terrible really). Ooo she will probably be expecting me to have wrote more of my story and songs by the time she gets back. Shit. So yeh, I'm listenin to Avril at the moment 'find yourself cos I cant find you, be yourself, who are you?' jolly good song. Its sooo bloody hot today, I with it would rain... in my bedroom. Well, im gonna go find something to do, night people.        Ooo    look   at   the    pretty    colours
