I hope that by recording my thoughts, I might be able to better organize said thoughts.  Also, I hope to keep a bit of a journal of what's happening, so that I can possibly look back and see 1) what I did, and 2) just how incredibly stupid I sounded.  Tomorrow I'm going to my first day in a sailing class down at the harbor.  I had to get a whole bunch of stuff for the class, Including a life jacket, sunglasses with a strap thingy, board shorts (there's going to be a swimming test I believe), and some other junk I can't remember.  I'm actually sort of looking forward to any swimming test they throw at me, I havn't been swimming since my High Adventure crew's workup hike on the Fish Bowls trail.  And swimming in the Fish Bowls doesn't really count as swimming--more like jumping into a 10 foot pit of ice water.  But that was fun, and I've rambled from my chosen subject.  Ok then.  More to come about my first day in class tomorrow afternoon.  ...Not bad for a real first post i suppose...
