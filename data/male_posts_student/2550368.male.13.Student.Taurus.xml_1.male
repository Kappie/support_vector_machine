I always say to myself "Well once I finsh dotBlog".. yea like thats ever going to happen. So now I finaly have one id like to express my panic because I need to do a few things by tomarow night. (Well auctly tonite becuse it's past 12): * Finsh the AdoDB plugin for smarty (CRITICAL!!) * Get PhoneZone working (CRITICAL!!) * Write a few pages to go on the site So i've got quite a bit ahead of me but because I am lazzy im putting it off till tomarow :)  Ehh im going to sleep.
