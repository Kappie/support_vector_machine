Long story short, Kyle thought that Eric Lindros was trying to kill us and that only he could protect us, Melissa started crying because she thought that noone loved her (she's just getting over this creep who dumped her after 11 months by saying that he didn't love her), I was trying to calm Kyle down so that he didn't kill everyone, and Matt was laughing. Isn't life grand?
