But make  yourself at home, do whatever you want here.  Originally this was going to be some type of political blog, but then I realized that I'm really more of a consumer than a creator as I was barely even turning out twice-warmed over news every other week.   I only ask that you keep you entry titles somewhat reasonably short.  If they are to long then they mess up the formatting of the left column.  I've learned some html, but I'm still very limited in what I can do.  I've turned comments back on so we can comment on each other post.  Also, there are several ways to post an image online.  You first need to upload it online.  I use  urlLink this  free picture hosting webpage, and link to the photos by html.   If you see anything you want me to change, add, or you have any questions, just send me an email.
