Fri: Work  Sat: Work, ball, talked to Will some more  Sunday: Work then church wit a friend.  We visited the Ebenezer Revival Church which is mainly dominated by African-Canadians.  We both hoped that there would be ppl dancing in the aisles and an extra-enthusiastic speaker... they went 2 for 2.  It was crazy!!  Very much like the movies...  Monday: My only day off till at least next Sunday >. After that we went to Boston Pizza.  My friends were short on cash so I covered most of the bill... I'm not gonna say how much, just that I spent ALOT more than I expected that nite, the food was good tho ^_^  When I got home that nite I finally got to hear IT from the person I wanted to hear it from the most.  At first she played as tho she didn't know what I was talking bout, tho I'm sure that was a buncha BS...  well she said what I expected her to say, and somethings I didn't... emotional convo then she disappeared...  Today: Woke up, msn (was the sole reason some1 was late for work) then some sc.  I am a 2v2LT pro... well not really, but I'm alot better now.  Lunch then work.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That's enough of the update...  Well, what do you think?  I loved a girl... she wouldn't tell me the truth.  She told me a half-truth which I accepted for the full truth at the time and was happy again.  She then left for a while and her bf told me that she had been leading me on the whole time...  Incredibly... I still can't abandon my feelings for her...  My verdict was:  LOSER  She didn't have the decency to tell me the truth and I still can't leave.  Am I a loser?  Like... what's wrong wit me?  Why can't I just leave those feelings behind?? **sigh** I will ALWAYS love you...  Lately I've been loving this song:  All4One - I Can Love You Like That   they read you cinderella   you hoped it would come true   that one day your prince charming would come rescue you   you like romantic movies   and you never will forget   the way it felt when romeo kissed juliet   and all this time that you've been waiting   you don't have to wait no more      i can love you like that   i would make you my world   move heaven and earth if you were my girl   i would give you my heart   be all that you need   show you you're everything that's precious to me   if you give me a chance, i can love you like that      i never make a promisei don't intend to keep   so when i say forever, forever's what i mean   i'm no casanova, but i swear this much is true,   i'll be holding nothing back when it comes to you   you dream of love that's everlasting, well baby open up your eyes      i can love you like that i would make you my world move heaven and earth if you were my girl i would give you my heart be all that you need show you you're everything that's precious to me if you give me a chance, i can love you like that      if you want tenderness, i've got tenderness   and i see through to the heart of you   if you want a man who will understand you don't have to look very far      i can love you like that i would make you my world move heaven and earth if you were my girl i would give you my heart be all that you need show you you're everything that's precious to me if you give me a chance, i can love you like that   It's true, I never make a promise I don't intend to keep... even tho I said that I wouldn't, I will...
