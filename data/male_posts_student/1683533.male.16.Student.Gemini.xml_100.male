I didn't have my Rivercity Rebels cd, or my Squirtgun cd, or any of my Suicide Machines cds :o.    Check this out: benihana856 (8:22:27 PM): and Mark, Mike, and Chris ( the label runners ) all said that there gonna make us the next big thing  Yes, there has been something secret going on, a littler project.  And we already are in the process of writing songs that may be on a mix cd of a record label  before the end of the month.   I don't want to say much more about this project untill we finish the recordings.  I went to a Before I Go/Half the Battle concert last night.  It was pretty cool.  I saw some people I knew and some people I hated.  The floor was all wet, so the pit was dangerous, so I didn't stay in it for long.  Somebody threw up in the sink of the bathroom. yuck!  The first band was scary.  They had face paint and a red light for the background and played really hardcore shit.  I didn't like them too much.  But I got a Before I Go EP which came with a poster.  My dad is bringing home Subway. cya.  "I should've been aborted." -Rivercity Rebels
