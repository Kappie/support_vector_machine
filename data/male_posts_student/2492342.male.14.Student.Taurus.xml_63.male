'why did jen wanna sit next to you?'  we had to talk...  'no you didnt'  uh yeah we did.... 'come on freshy. no one really lieks you. they just use you.'  i dont remember what happened after that. but i just remember being pissed at her.  thats what making me go over the edge. supposedly im her best friend(well, ahvent shceked since jenna came) and look at all the shit im taking. samanthas the only one who actually seems to care how shitty i feel. ack. i hate my life  over the weekend...since jen didnt get to cutting me after school.... i cut myself 11 times....it was actually nice. it stung..but..it was an interesting sensation. i like it. but i have to wear long sleeves from now on....hm...  weekend..was ok..nothing at all interesting. i should call ceci today tho. but i have a bunch of homework since i have work wednesday night. and a history midterm tomorrow.  monday...today..my best day. i woke up at a good time....its my dogs birthday. we're going to petsmart. lol  free double..stayed with melanie most of it...did random things. i called her fat and stupid tho. sort of. lol  spanish.....brightons getting surgery on he rnose and chin fat friday.   "lifestyles..of the rich and the famous............................................"   ahha...some people think im poor tho..lol....cause everyones like 'i got a laptop for my birthday! 'i got an ipod!'...i got a shirt? hah...and Cds and books. thats good tho. i like Cds. and i ahve a laptop.   melanie told me how to get internet on my laptop. yay.  spanish....ummm.....  i talked to jennifer most of the time. she hasnt eaten since last tuesday. her nails had gotten blue and her hands were freezing. we talked about drugs too. shes gonna get high on speed friday after school at the movies, so she invited me to go. i doubt ill do anything tho. im scared of drugs. nice....  she said she wanted to overdose. i hope not. she has to go to woodland hilsl tho cause her drug dealer friend is there. i dont know if ill really go. ill see.  'if u looked in my eyes, would u see whats inside, would u even care?'  thats a really good line. its from a song im hearing right now. 'dreaming of you ' by selena..hah its so aisha.  i talked to her sunday night. her mom told her she was too naive to go to public school. hah yeah. but she puts up a facade. shes not as naive as everyone thinks. sometimes. except when matt talks about bjs. lol  im sitting in the comp lab alone...  brighton was annoyed at me today or soemthing. she ignored me a lot. who knows. in math we had a substitute....talked a lot. shaidas bitchy. she doesnt like me anymore. its funny...  i need to go..mom shoudl be here soon...                .................i suddenly feel guilty...who knows  much love  peace  ~alejo
