If you need to pee, ya REALLY gotta pee............so when it's time to die, you will die............it's better to let go than suffer from a burst bladder............die i mean............. I agree it might sound like an irresponsible way to put things, but hey, wake up and smell the roses............you can't control how long you live...........we cannot tell when we will die from piss leaking into our blood stream through a hole in our bladders...........or die from SARS (which incidentally i strongly believe Osama created the virus)........ as a good friend of mine puts it, "No point lah...."  the only responsible thing you can do is live your life happily and make sure all those around you have happy memories to remember you with..................that way, they will in turn do the same for their friends..............
