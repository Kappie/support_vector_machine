We have been out doing things and stuff for a while now. We hit the Children's Museum (the  DINOSAUR  exhibit is very cool) RAWR!, the bowling alley (bowled a  77   ), the arcade for some    D  D  R  , and of course, K-mart. In case you haven't noticed, I'm     A  B  U  S  I  N  G   C  O  L  O  U  R!!!!!   (note the U, very Canadian). The reason for this is that I am  VERY TIRED!!!!!  For instance, I can't tell my rights from writes. Or wrongs or lefts or something. Anyway, this knew (I mean new) template line is a great one from scarlet Letter.  So Evelyn (wings) is right next to me now, and she wants this to be known, despite the fact that that means all her potential internet stalkers will know EXACTLY WHERE SHE IS. Anyway, I'm gonna let her type for a short spell.  I have no idea what to right, so I'll (oops, I'm doing it too. Too much cousin bonding time methinks) just tell you all to go read my blog which I'll be updating more frequently since my mom knows about it now and I won't have to hide from her when I post. I'm planning a    "Surviving the Comstocks: Into the heart of Indianapolis's Insane community"    for my upcoming blogs, so stay tuned.   Anyway, I don't have so much more to say right now, so I'm gonna rap up this entry. Darn, well to save face, I'll actually rap up this entry.  (Beatboxing) The entry is over  I typed the last word  So stop reading now  Or I'll flip you the bird  Word.  (Addendum: How the heck does the Blogger spell check not know the word"blog"????? I mean, seriously!)    Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
