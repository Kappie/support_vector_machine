I love  urlLink Mozilla  (I shouldn't have to explain why if you've ever used it) and I refuse to go to  any other  browser.  I've been using Mozilla Firebird and Firefox since they both launched and I will continue supporting them both (in fact I am thinking about donating some money to Mozilla.org).  But I know soooo many blogs and websites that are not even close to being "Mozilla-friendly" ... and some that aren't friendly for ANY browser (but I won't include  urlLink names  here).  So, from this day forward, I must say, INTERNET EXPLORER IS EVIL!
