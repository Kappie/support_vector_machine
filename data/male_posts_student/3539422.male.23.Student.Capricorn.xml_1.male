In so many ways, Americans are grateful for the sacrifice of this young war hero.  He dramatically personifies what can easily become just a numerical statistic, reminding everyone of the tragedy of each life lost.  He will also continue to inspire young Americans and teach them the meaning of sacrifice, honor and duty.  Pat Tillman was only 27 years old but his life reflects a larger movement among young Americans who are called by a sense of service and responsibility.  The pop-culture in America today relentlessly targets the young with a “if it feels good, do it” motto.  This message, aimed directly at impressionable young minds, promotes radical individualism, overindulgence and narcissism.  Freedom and love are divorced from any notion of responsibility.  Despite the powerful and unfortunate grasp this message has on many young people, a growing number of them are realizing that such a lifestyle will leave them with a painful emptiness.  Such young people, like Pat Tillman, realize that a life of service results is a much more fulfilling vocation. In light of the growing controversy over the Iraq prison abuse, it would be helpful and wise to remember that the great majority of our young soldiers is made up of individuals, heroes, like Pat Tillman.   urlLink    Pat Tillman  Tillman understood clearly the risks involved in joining the Army Rangers.  He was deeply affected by the events of September 11, 2001 and felt called to serve a higher purpose.  He willingly embraced a more difficult vocation with all the risks involved, leaving a multi-million dollar career in the NFL to serve his nation in the war on terror.  He was called to serve and to protect the liberties he and all Americans enjoy on a day to day basis.  It was a service ultimately rooted in love of neighbor.  His decision to serve was a sincere one, so sincere that he avoided any and all fanfare to follow him as a result.  The Holy Father often reiterates that only in giving of oneself, completely and unreservedly, can one find fulfillment and purpose in life.  This “gift of self” comes in many different forms throughout one’s life.  Certainly Pat Tillman, who understood the meaning of a higher calling, personifies this notion of “gift” to a heroic degree.  He responded, in his own way, to the call to live a life for others. Tillman helped Americans identify more personally with the other soldiers who, in a similar manner, offered up their lives in the name of service and love.  It is a sad fact that many of the soldiers who have died in combat were young.  It is a remarkable tribute to their character that these young citizens undertook such a self-less and dangerous task in the prime of their lives, fully aware of the perils that lay ahead.  These soldiers embody the very best of the current generation of young Americans.  America’s youth will no doubt be inspired by the example of Pat Tillman and will likely emulate his life of service and sacrifice in their own way.
