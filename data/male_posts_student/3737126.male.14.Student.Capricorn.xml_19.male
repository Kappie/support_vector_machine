They have friends who they can share their innermost secrets. Friends whom they can ask about their crushes and maybe have a crush on one of them. I wonder how somebody got to have girl friends, how they become barkada, how they become ease with each other and hang out with each other. I on the other hand had no girl friend. Only acquaintances who know me as the brother of their former schoolmate and batch valedictorian, his brother who did not choose to go to the same school and the guy who is a huge torpe. It is in being a girl friend that one becomes a girlfriend. The long relationship as friends developed into something more intimate and special…   So the practice today was canceled, my glasses are missing, and I\m getting depressed again. Hope you like my new lay-out…
