Bangalore, India, Asia, The World, 'Our' Solar System, The Milky Way, The Universe.   I love Computers i.e. Hardware  Software and anything related to Computers....   From Programming with Low Level Assembly ... VC++ ... Managed Extensions for VC++ .NET ... C# .NET ... VB .NET ... Sun Java ... Polymorphic C# ... F# ... for Longhorn (XAML etc.) and whatever comes my way...   I also like Designing Hardware... I'm doing a course on Embedded Systems and I'm quite used to making Control Systems with the Intel MCS 51 (8051 uP)...  Well I've done the 'Windows 2000 Professional' Exam from Microsoft and attempted the MCSD for VB6 exams when I was 11 but I secured around 55%... I'm A+ Cerified and I want to do my MCAD for C# really badly...   I'll try updating this blog atleast every alternate day but its going to be tough with school right round the corner... It's quite difficult to have my food, freshen up, spend an hour with my grandparents (everyday), do my school homework, put the next days books into my bag, study all my subjects, keep updated with technology, update this blog and do all this between 3 PM (when school gets over in the evening) and around 1 AM (when I go to sleep).  Okay then... I'm off to have dinner...
