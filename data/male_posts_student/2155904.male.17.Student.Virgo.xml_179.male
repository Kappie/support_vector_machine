Tyke got up nice and late though and that made it a good start.  But then his mom made him do some work for her before he went to school. He had to find stuff around the house and show her how to use some things.  When they were trying to find the manual to Tyke's videocamera she thought they wouldn't be able to find it so she asked him if she had permission to go through Tyke's room to try and find it.  Tyke quickly responded "NO."  She laughed but Tyke was serious.  Can't let all those quarter grades and semester grades be found now.  That's all that Tyke can think of that he is hiding in there though.  But still, the possibility of her finding them is too great.  Tyke found the manual anyway though.  Weight training was pretty fun today.  Tyke got to work out hard and then play basketball.  The class decided they wanted to play bump so Tyke played along with them.  He had a 3peat.  Yep, 3 big wins in the game of bump.  He just couldn't be beat.  It was definitely his game.  English today was weird.  They were supposed to take this AP test but Tyke and Amed definitely weren't gonna have that happen.  They just put random guesses down and spelled out words by circling certain letters in a row.  It was fun.  Then Tyke called Purdy's phone and left a message RSVP'ing for this Saturday.  He whispered the message.  It was fun.  Tyke felt like a real badass.  They graded their own tests and Tyke just filled in some wrong answers in order to give himself a comparable score to the rest of the class.  After school wasn't much fun today.  He has had the house to himself the entire night as his parents are working on his grandpa's funeral services and such so they have been out.  This meant that Tyke had to take care of his own dinner.  Because Tyke took forever to do his CE stuff cuz he wasn't ever focusing on it he made himself a very poor dinner.  A bagel.  With cream cheese.  And a 7UP.  Oh yeah, later on he grabbed another bagel and ate that too.  This must be why Tyke is pretty dang skinny.  Although whenever he tries to gain weight he can't.  Tyke was disappointed to find out tonight that his bicep is just under 12 inches around.  Unfortunately for Tyke he was unable to meet that big foot mark.  Hey, he is a skinny guy though.  Tyke also killed a spider tonight with his grad project handbook.  That was exhilirating.  This spider was insanely fast.  Probably the fastest spider he has ever seen.  It basically went 600 feet in 2 seconds.  Basically.  Wow, what a creature.  But now it's dead.  So Tyke managed to "complete" his CE project and talked about a wide array of topics throughout the night.  The weather was insane.  That hail came down in buckets.  It was wicked cool.  But also very loud and annoying.  Tyke also managed to make a new mix today.  He is pleased with it at this stage in listening.   But Tyke just realized that this is probably the first time in his life that he hasn't done something for his dad's birthday or at least seen him on it.  Life sure has changed this year.  Much more going on.  And next year will be even different.  Wow, what a change it will be.  Only 3 more months.  33 more days.  That is remarkable.  A long time coming indeed.  Man, Tyke wishes he had something fun to say but he really doesn't.  He is totally out of ideas to talk about.  That's a bummer.
