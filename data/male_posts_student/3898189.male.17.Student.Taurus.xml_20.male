(^_-)   So around Noon Theo called and we whent up to the mall and played this really cool arcade game that is alot of fun. You can shoot people in the nuts and look at their facial expressions.  After that we came back here for a few minutes to get some N64 games, and then went to his house.  We played Mario Tennis, Pod Racer, Wrestling, and then we played Pokemon Stadium...(Along with his older Bro Chris...He is fun to hang with as well)   Then came home ate food, and played Spider man 2 on Xbox fer a minute.  Then I got on the computer and turned on the X Games.  THat is about the gist of today.  Last night I also stayed up until 1:00 a.m. talking to my friend Steph.   That is about all I have to say for today.
