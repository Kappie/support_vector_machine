Wouldn't you know it, the weather conspired to make it one of the worst days for driving, ever. It warmed up just enough to rain, and then turned to ice. It added an additional two hours to what is normally a 6-hour drive. We saw 7 accidents on the way there, including a semi-tractor trailer on its side.  We were suffering from a definite shortage of Fahrvergn√ºgen.  18-Wheelers used to draw our scorn, especially in bad weather. But the new object of our disaffection is the Sport Utility Vehicle. What is it about these big metal boxes that turn soccer moms and young urban professionals into behaving like they're tank-driving Soviet stormtroopers putting down student dissidents in Czechoslovakia?  We observed a lot of SUVs passing on the inside lane, driving way too fast for conditions, and following other drivers too closely in an attempt to speed them up or convince them to move to another lane. Hey SUV owners! What is it that causes you to be in such a bigger hurry than the rest of us? Is your life that much more exciting and eventful than other mortals? Are you so important and integral to the scheme of things at work that your boss makes you show up 15 minutes earlier than the rest of your coworkers? Or is it possible that you're as human as the rest of us, with the exception of an extra-small bladder, and T-- and I are just misinterpreting your frantic attempts to find the nearest rest stop as uncharitable commuting behavior?  Probably not.  Hey SUV owners! You have no right to get churlish with other drivers even if your vehicle cost more than their entire home. Remember that you own a rapidly depreciating vehicle, not the whole friggin' road!
