Well i was hoping only bags, but they check my wallet too! wallets are not ment to be checked! its personal! stupid Mr Roy. Luckily i hid the condom at my back pocket but wasn't lucky, he checked it and found my condom!... no fair! Good bye condom. Then he handed it to Mr Appolos, then i and Appolos went to talk. He asked me stupid questions. I lied to him and he believed me. Hahah! Well he gave me this Student's Statement paper and ask me to write what, why and how i got the condom. Well planned, i lied in the statement. The last part said, "Its up to you to believe me or not." When he read that part, he asked me this stupid question and i just stopped him and said, "Curiosity killed the cat." He just kept quiet. Haha! Oh well... i am sure a bad boy now. I even dared him to look into my records to see if i have any bad record, well guess what... i am right after all... i do not have any bad records and Mr Appolos was surely surprised when i turned into a rotten tomato. Haha! Oh well. After school i went for Detention for being late. Then went home. And here i am. Well Please do not adjust your computer. There is no ghost of S Club 7 okie... its this new link  that allows your blog to be like a radio! cool eh! Well all thanks to Daniel ^_^ ... thanks Daniel. MUACKS!.
