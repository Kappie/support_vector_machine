Oh man! It is friggin' hot here in Concord! For the past week or so its been like 85 degrees outside. I mean, we went from February Freezing-Ass Temperatures to Out of Nowhere Heat in the middle of March. It's almost hard to imagine. Lemme tell you, spring has started out of nowhere!  Well, as the heat kicks in I have my routine of staying cool. Well, I don't have to try; I'm already cool! Hehe. But I'll try to keep cool. I'll keep you posted.
