"A dispute over clothes and a  video game system  between a young woman and a squatter in her grandparents' house apparently sparked the vicious beating and stabbing murders of six people whose bodies were found late last week in a blood-spattered home, police said."  I am currently hanging out in D.C. with my illustrious girlfriend. I managed to get out of the apartment today before noon. Yeay for jack and mediocre work ethic. I cannot fail to mention the current loaner car my GF is sporting right now, a beater 88 jag. She gets her new car sometime today. The jag is suffering from classic British build quality syndrome. The list of malfunctions.... (drum roll) 3 out of 4 door handles do not work from the outside, AC does not work, the brake pressure is low, trunk does not open through either the internal release or use of the key, alignment is off, wheel cover/lock is missing, gas cap does not close, sun roof does not function properly, trip computer has failed completely, the car vibrates in reverse gear, and no cup holders (i know that is not a malfunction but i spilled my coffee and that lack of holders is plain stupid). I am sure I'm missing something, but I've only driven it twice.
