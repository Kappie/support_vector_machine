Also a guy named Jonars.  In the past week I've been working on Rat, the magazine for mall rats.  20 pages, three people, one week.  I have it as a pdf, and if anyone knows how I could upload it to the internet, that would be awesome, because then you could all see it.  Triennium, as Nathan said, was phenomenally awesome.  Words cannot describe.  There was a Wizard of Oz event that was like a Journalcon on crack.  Not only did we quote and snark, but there were Rocky Horror Picture Show-esque interactivities.  Thomas, Nathan, and I, as flying monkeys, waited until the witch said "Fly, Fly, Fly!" then ran around the audience in masks, fezes, and wings screaming, whooping and jumping. It was crazy fun.  A girl in my small group broke my slinky, so we cut off the broken part.  The girl (Maria) turned it into a bracelet, so now I have a half-slinky, and I can tell people truthfully that the rest of my slinky is on some girl's wrist in California.  If that's not awesome, I don't know what is.  Anyway, that's all I have to say, also that I'm gonna update Corndog really soon.
