I highly reccomend it, it's so hilarious!I spent a lot of time in town yesterday with Gavin and his new girlfriend (who by the way is one of the most annoying girls I have ever met!). I bumped into a lot of people. Simon, Scott, Zoe and Nuala from high school andmy cousin David (who I haven't seen for years)and his mates. I had 2 Big Mac meals from McDonalds as they are a bit lovely! Come back home and Mandy made me such a nice curry! Very stuffed that night. I spent most of today sleeping and then practicing acoustic non-stop. I learned (this weekend)Master of Puppets (the breakdown) and the intro to Behind Blue Eyes so I am quite proud of myself. Anyway, I'm bored and don't know what else to write so I think I shall go. xx
