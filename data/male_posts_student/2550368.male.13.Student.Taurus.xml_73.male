Irked by a profusion of pet excrement on the small lawn of the federal courthouse in downtown Austin, U.S. District Judges Sam Sparks and Lee Yeakel issued an order on Thursday:  "Any person who authorizes or permits any animal to relieve itself on the grass or grounds of the United States Courthouse shall be subject to citation, fine, and/or arrest effective from this date...  "Too many individuals had permitted their pets to relieve themselves on the grass and grounds," the order said.  The courthouse neighbors a ritzy loft development, and the dog owners who live there are the apparent targets of the order.  The courthouse has the only grass in the immediate area.  ---  LOL!
