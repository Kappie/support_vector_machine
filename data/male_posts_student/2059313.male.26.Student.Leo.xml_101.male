I don't want it to come, because I've had such a great weekend, and I don't want it to end.  I wouldn't be surprised if I have some withdrawal symptoms tomorrow.   As you can tell, Saturday I went on a retreat to Red River Gorge with some of the most awesome people I know and have met.  We spent all day in prayer and contemplation and community.  And then we went rock climging and hiking.  Then today, I got to spend some more time with a great friend of mine.  We saw a musical called "Bat Boy".  One of the coolest shows I've seen, by far.  It's one of those shows you really just need to see in order to understand... and then we went to eat, and then I went to church and was supposed to answer a question pertaining to what we had gotten out of our small groups on Tuesday night.  I listened to all the other people answer their questions, and they all sounded eloquent and passionate and great... then it was my turn, and I just felt like a big idiot... I don't know if I even made any sense, or if I was even putting whole thoughts together in any kind of order... but I really enjoyed the service, the music was especially great tonight.  Then I stayed to help take down the environment and some of went out to eat, and I had a lot of fun.  It may not seem like I'm portraying the intensity of this weekend or the amount of postive vibes that I received, but it was incredible.  So I think I may be a little down tomorrow.    I hope I'm wrong.
