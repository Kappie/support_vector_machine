It was tons of fun, the water was pretty choppy today cause of all the boats out on the water, but it was fun! And it was way cooler on the water than well anywhere else. I seriously don't know how people around here live without air conditioning. I am seriously like one of three people in my neighborhood with air conditioning. I couldn't do it. Dead serious. Thats about all I did today .... so now I'm super bored.   I talked to Alex today, she wanted to hang out, but I told her I was busy. So, I guess I'll see her after my trip. Oh yeah, did I mention I'm going to San Francisco with Emmy on Tuesday. That's in three days. Yep, I'm excited. I've never really gone on a trip with just my friends thats unsupervised. I mean we all went to NYC, and DC, and Boston for spring break, but we had like teacher supervision and what not. This trip is all on us. It'll be fun.  I don't really have much else to say for today, seein as I didn't do too much.
