They range from "eat anything you can turn into a smoothie" to "as long as it doesn't go in the mouth" (for the bolder members of the family).  I'm sure it comes as a surprise to no one, the "inventors" of these diets (I put inventors in quotation marks because they really didn't do much at all) make upwards of $10,000.  Which got me thinking, "I could do that..."  So here's my plan.   The Four-Year-Old's Golden Path   My program reveals the cryptic and ancient secrets of child day care specialists.  You go on a one month binge of:      Grape juice      Crackers (but with no cheese) (unless you use that stuff from a can with the bacon flavoring, I like that stuff)      Small amounts of ice cream      Broiled skinless chicken breast (cut up into small squares)      Hot dog (cut up into small squares)      Baby carrots      Celery w/peanut butter  raisins (specifically) and most importantly      Twice the daily recommended amount of Flinstones Chewables (but not the red ones)  Within the first two weeks, you'll have more energy, guaranteed.   Don't forget to nap!
