Laura, if by some bizarre chance you end up reading this, don't click that link, even if you already know everything that's in it.  I refrained from reading your online diary when I found it.  And Soph?  At least you've "dated" someone.  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
