     
      I finally finished up the character concept sketches and one-third of the script for my comic. I have also updated the comic (which at this moment isn't working because .tk is a piece of crap). I really want to buy a domain, but I lack the credit card (and my dad will not let me use his, it took me a year and a half to convince him to let me get a paypal account). Ah... if only www.himherthem.com was mine, instead of having to use a spyware infested redirecting service like dot-tk.  Since most of you read my comic (at least I hope you still do...) I wanted to let you know that it has the first page up. It isn't as clean looking as the old one, but I like it this way. It's a little more messy and the coloring is different (more simple). I'm illustrating something a little more personal this time. The old story was much more corny and I had no idea what I was going to do after the first chapter. You can check out the change at www.himherthem.tk. If it's not working and says 'DOMAIN NAME IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. PLEASE TRY AGAIN IN 5 MINUTES.' it's because dot-tk is a bastard. It has done this a dozen times this week.  As of right now I am doing only two things. Looking for a job and my comic. It's pretty lame and boring for me right now (although most of my friends spend the day eating cereal and lying down in their basements watching nicktoons). I'm also doing some mini-comics (Kinkoâ€™s style) that I will sell around Vancouver. I met a woman who said she would put my comics for sale at her comic shop, which will be pretty awesome.  Hope your all having an interesting summer!
