I must say it's possibly most because of sunday, the first time I had been able to sleep in. Having my host sister from Japan staying with me the past two weeks (I had been living with her family in yokosuka for a semester with AFS), trying to show her around, and keep her entertained was defiantly a stress. Though it was so much fun to see her again and introduce her to friends I told her about and shown pictures of, I am rather releived to have things back to normal. Mmm'hmm.  Well, I have work tonight over at "Homma's Brown Rice Sushi". Ah, I do so love it there. And in the meantime,  urlLink Trogdor  calls.
