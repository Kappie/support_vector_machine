The best part about it was getting to see a friend and be somewhat of a comfort to them when it seemed like they may've needed it.  Truly, the best part was feeling the presence of God's guiding hand working to help me act as a tool for him, by helping one of his children.  There are things that can be explained, and there are things that can't be explained, but you can sometimes take a good guess at them.  I think I took a pretty good guess yesterday and came pretty close to the mark.  It is remarkable what you can do when you completely let go and let God take control.  Now why do I have such a difficult time doing that all the time, and in areas of my life that I definitely need more help in?
