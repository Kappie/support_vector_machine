Lost the game, looking forward to the FTP game. And i vow to pitch better, properly, and concentrate better i hope. A win against FTP would mean a 2nd round place. But tougher, facing ACSi, Catholic High, and maybe YuYing. After that, still went back to kallang for more more training. Went home by bus 16. Halfway through air-conditioner disfunction. All the passengers got a complimentary ticket, continued the journey with bus 14.
