It is instead populated by regular old retail salespeople who really are just waiting for their next break, like all retail salespeople do.  I had to play around with a laptop for ten minutes before a kid with ill advised facial hair asked me unenthusiastically if I had any questions.  and then he couldn't answer my questions   The guy at the genius bar was a little different, he could answer my questions and was very nice and knowledgeable.  (Although he didn't give me a straight answer when i asked him about typical versus max battery life on the ibook.)  I was somehow expecting someone to try to sell me on something while I was there.  Should I be praising them for no pressure sales tactics?  probably, but i went there to be convinced that i should switch from my pc world to theirs. and they didn't do it.   macs are not designed by people who have big clumsy hunks of meat where most people have hands.  if they were, they would have put in the ability to temporarily disable the trackpad while thick fingered lusers are typing. I tried typing "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" but towards the end of the sentence i accidentally moved the cursor via the trackpad to the middle of the sentence.  the genius's solution was to plug in a mouse, and learn to type better.  If any computer makers are listening, please please please make more computers with that little joystick eraser head shaped thing in the middle of the keyboard.  It makes my life a lot easier.   the powerbook doesn't just have better insides than the ibook, but it seems to be constructed better outside as well.  the screen on the ibook seemed flimsy when i tried to close it, but the powerbook seemed just fine, nice and sturdy.  And I swear that the trackpad responded more quickly on the powerbook than it did on the ibook.  (man, i really don't like the trackpad.) and the trackpad button didn't seem to work as well on the ibook as on the powerbook.  And it didn't look as cute as I expected it to look.   But I don't know that the powerbook is worth 800 more dollars.     I really want to become a mac user.  I like the company, I'm impressed by their desire to innovate, and what really amazed me was how much easier it is to do something like add memory to a desktop version than it was on my pc.  They seem to have realized that somebody might want to open up the computer and get inside it at some point.  They have a door.  with my HP I had to unscrew stuff, take out the power supply, partially remove some side panel.  it was a mess. But I was really less than impressed by my mac store experience.  and what's up with that dock at the bottom?  it is very annoying, the way it moves around all the time.  but it looks so pretty.   I guess that after all, it is just a computer.  it isn't the revolutionary, world changing, tool of individualism, that fights the evil empire, and makes me smarter, sexier, and hipper that the marketing team had led me to believe it is.
