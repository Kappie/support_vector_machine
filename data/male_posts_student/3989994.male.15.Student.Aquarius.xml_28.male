It may get the added awe and respect but when the woodcutters come, can the garden back into a corner and say it is not actually a forest?  Deceit, is a painful game, and when you stumble too far in, there is little coming back out. If you wanted soemthing work for it, do not stop till you get it, and do not ever compromise.  Live like you want to, not what falls into your way.
