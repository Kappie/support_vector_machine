Unless, of course, I end up failing something... and then I'll be hearing about it for the next two years.   So nothing has really happened....    So the summer is upon us, and I still don't have a job.  The lady from Barnes  Nobles still hasn't called me back, and Malec's isn't hiring... so I've got to get out and hunt once finals are over...  If I don't get a job this summer I will be royally pissed off.  If it comes down to it, I can always apply at Giant and become the scum of the universe....   whatever earns me an income.   So tomorrow is a day full of language... German III in the morning and English in the afternoon.  Oh boy.  I'm ready for another day of school kicking my ass... can you tell?  Whatever.  Doesn't really matter to me anymore.  The band has a gig on the 11th... yay.  We haven't really seriously practiced since Jamfest, so this could be really ugly.  All I know is that half of us hate the name, and the other half like the name (Stereo Stroke)....  I like it.  It kinda just grew on me cause I heard it so much from Jamfest and everything...   I made a poster for this gig, but being that school's out, there's nowhere to really post it... I'm thinking about maybe in Roberto's, Cornerstone, and random other places... dunno how that'll work out.  Here's a  urlLink link  to it, and if you can advertise it, feel free, cause the more people we get to come, the better it will be.  And yes, I do realize that the poster doesn't fill the page... I'm just too lazy to fix it right now.  Sorry.  Well I hope to see anyone and everyone there... It should be good, and if it's not... oops oh well.  That's all for now... Sleep time.
