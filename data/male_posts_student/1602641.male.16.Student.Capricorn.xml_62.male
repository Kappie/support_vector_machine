I grimaced when I realized that one of the peanuts I was chewing was extremely soft and wet. Yep, that's right folks - I ate a rancid peanut! Fortunately, I wasn't traumatized by this incident to the point of never touching peanuts again, unlike my last experience with Vanilla Coke.   Oh, I never shared that story, did I?  It was about two years ago. My house's air conditioner was on the fritz. One night it was about 95 degrees and I woke up in a hot sweat, desperately thirsty. I went to the fridge, pulled out a nice cold Vanilla Coke, and started drinking it down with exceptional gusto. I paused for a second and noticed a number of black specks around the bottle's rim. They were twitching. Upon closer examination, I discovered that these curious little things were - oh joy! - ants. Ants! All over the part of the bottle that I had been furiously sucking at seconds earlier! The filthy lil' mofos had somehow crawled under the cap seal in an effort to reach the sweet sugary nectar inside! I dumped the bottle out into the sink, vomitted, and never so much as touched a Vanilla Coke ever again.
