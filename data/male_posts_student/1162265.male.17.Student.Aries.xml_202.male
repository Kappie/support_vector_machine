Even worse are the POC in the 'burbs (and their wigger homies) who do all the above, minus the gunplay.  Afrocentricism/cultural nationalism: Just 'cause you don't eat pork, pray to an invisible mystery spook besides Jesus whose name most cannot pronounce (or you pray to a black Jesus), or you only eat itals doesn't make you a sufferah, a rasta, a muslim, or a revolutionary.  Buying "black", "La Raza", etc; I've been buying black for a long time, for some things I still do, yet I am no freer; neither are the folks I buy from. It feels good, looks good, but still we live in bigger cages with longer chains. The only real affirmative action is that you will do more time if your skin is dark. And god help you if you're from another country.  posted by ernesto @ 8:43 PM Monday, December 29, 2003 more on complacency politics Since I threw down the 25 Deciembre comments on lifestyle politics, I've had numerous intriguing messages, interactions and comments. I wanted to sum up and elaborate on a few points.  The fault of lifestyle politics, I just wrote, is that it dumbs down political action to what's small, easy or convenient. It also assumes people are inherently stupid, lazy and middle class. The lifestylist approach becomes an end unto itself; one where action starts at not buying a given product, and eventually ends there, because it's assumed that lifestylism (anything from boycotting X-store to using granola soaps) is where people have to start, with no coherent strategy for building beyond it. Lifestylism is complacency politics, and I am no doubt pointing out the obvious.  Angus, who's got a mad nice site here mentioned that he met a person who used the term "food liberals" to describe this affliction. Can I get a witness?  Just so it's out there, I'm not writing about anyone in particular, save the white male who wanted to lecture me about Colombians (and I got a few irritated white folks complaining about me pointing out his race, which is another commentary someday). I post these things for people of color to think about our objective conditions and what it will take to win our liberation. To be truthful, I expect most white activists to be into lifestyle politics, because many are privileged enough where to drink or not drink Coke is a major personal decision (contrast with miseducation of one's people's history, one's family members going to the pen because of racist cops, and denial of land). However, I expect people of color to be more critical, because our survival depends on it. Too many of us who link in with the white left accept mental colonialism happily. We need to think outside of dominant-culture conventions. Lord knows it's gotten the white left nowhere in the last 30 years.  posted by ernesto @ 11:07 PM
