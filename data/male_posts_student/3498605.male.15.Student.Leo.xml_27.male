I'm teaching some people lacrosse, I'm going to a lacrosse camp at Loyola University, I'm going to a camp in Michigan with my best friend. That should be fun. Plus, I'm going to my lake house on Silver Lake, WI and I'm officialy working for my Dad's company doing work that normally a college grad would do. I mean, I'm actually going on site and setting up networks and stuff. Plus, I get $12.00 an hour, starting salary :). Also, I'm just going to hang out with my friends a lot. Anyways, I'm going to a Microsoft Seminar tomorrow in Downers Grove. It is for Microsoft Business Partners only and I'm going with my Dad's company. Seeing as I will be the youngest person there, and I actually understand what is going on, I feel very special :). Anyways, to all my friends who are reading this, I hope to see you a lot over the summer. If not, have a GREAT summer.  later, bradleyJ
