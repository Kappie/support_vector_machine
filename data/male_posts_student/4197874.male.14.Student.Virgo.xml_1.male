Today i spent most of it getting my sig ready to be mapped with help from Meky because i would have been lost if it weren't for her... i finished a good and i am about 4/15 of the way through the next one :3 and i will be "reading" more >.>;; My dad is really gunna kill me with this whole thing he is like "you need to read" everytime he sees me and this morning he said that and i was reading XD... Well i really haven't done anything other than been on Gaia and reading nothing going on with friends because i kinda got grounded.... i dunno how it works but i just kinda told myslef i was so that i would get my books read and guess what IT'S WORKING.. kids out there who are having troubles with patients and stuff while reading ground yourself :3 i read about 100 pages just this morning ^_^ ... alright i just got really confused a little yellow bubble just keeps poping up on my computer telling me something curupted and i don't know but words that end in rupted aren't very reassuring.. OHH!! and another thing i still haven't slept since yesterday i think this is the longest i have gone all summer so.. uh... w00t well i guess this covers two nights of Chino's life i promise to post in here tomorrow night :)
