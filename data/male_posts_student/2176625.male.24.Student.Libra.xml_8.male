I have something I need to do first and thinking to do. She put the choice in my hands: 1. Break up for good (we are broken up as of 2 months ago) and don't stay friends.  Leave things how they are and don't look back. 2. Break up and stay friends. 3. Get back together and break up when she goes back to Ohio in May. 4. Get back together, she moves her stuff back in and she moves with me in July to CA. I wait it out until she is ready to get married or we break up later down the line.  The fact of the matter that I have to be the one to decide what our future together or part will be is making my decision easier. The signal that she could take me or leave me is so loud and clear it should be a billboard in Times Square.
