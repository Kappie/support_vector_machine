Kinda ironic to say that though, cause it's suppose to be depressing...is it? Anyway, talking about crying, I really felt like doing so after my Chemistry paper. It was so badly done I knew. I had never been so sure of doing badly for Chemistry. So I kinda broke down, but I didn't really cry though, was just so upset, cause all the papers were a catastrophe. But I'm ok. I have to try to relax and take things easy. But I think I had better study hard for my SA2. Can't believe I actually thought of getting 4 A1s for the End-of-Year. But I'll try to do it. After all, I wouldn't mind the $250 for Best Progress...hehe...*eyes rolling with $$$$*   Today was kinda great. Cause I got back my Chinese paper. I'm top in the class again. But it's only A2. And my class isn't really fantastic too, cause there are so many people who got their As in other classes. Oh well, at least it pulls down my L1R5. Then played carrom in band room after school. Somehow, people still think I'm good, and also find my fancy shots strange. But Mervin's the first person to attempt the fancy shots I do. hehe...he'll go a long way...(hey...who am I to say that). Just kidding...I'm really just an average player. And this was followed by an all out basketball session at Kin Lok's place. It was nice playing the game once again.   I watched 'High School Reunion' yesterday. And it kinda reminded me of my old school mates. Yippee!!! Teachers' Day will be here soon. And I hope I'll be able to gather with them this year. I decided to do something though. I'm gonna confess to my class monitoress that I had a crush on her. Not that I want her to know, but thought it'll be fun to laugh about it. Although I think she already knows. Or maybe the whole class knows. Ah!!! Abram didn't keep the secret!!! (he's my best friend in primary school.) Anyway, so exciting. I can imagine it now...hehe...so amusing.   Many things happen in my life this year. Particularly with other people. And things just don't turn out well. But somehow, I feel much more assured now. Cause I know that God makes all things beautiful in His time. So like the song says, Some Day We'll Know...   Listening to 'It's gonna be love' sang by Mandy Moore again. And there's something I disagree about the song. It goes:  The sooner you let two hearts beat together The sooner you'll know this love is forever (it's gonna be love) Love needs time now or never  And I disagree, cause like I learned, sometimes love have to wait. And the part about now or never. Sometimes,it's time now and it'll be never love. Ok, that's all I guess. Gotta rush on work.
