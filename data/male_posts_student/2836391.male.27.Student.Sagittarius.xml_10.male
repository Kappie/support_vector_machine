It was really good to spend the afternoon with the class, getting to know each other a bit better. The variety of ages and experience in the class makes it really interesting. They're a great bunch of people, and I'm going to really enjoy this semester.  On another subject, I found out yesterday that our Youth Pastor is going to a new church, leaving in May. He's been with us for coming up to 4 years. He's going to a job that will be full time, instead of the half time that our church has been able to give him. So, for him it is a good decision, especially since his wife has family down there, but for the rest of us it feels a bit uncertain. At the moment we don't know who will be replacing him, or what will happen, so things there are a bit up in the air.
