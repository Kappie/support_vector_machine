The article also emphasized that Franken and his fellow hosts don't have much experience in radio and haven't been taking best advantage of the medium. I don't have a link for you. In fact, I only mention it because it gives me an excuse to try and be funny. Emphasis on "try."   The Air America Radio Network: Programming Schedule for Saturday April 17   6:00 AM -- "Liberal Morning," the show where radio personalities describe what they see as they watch the sun rise through a smog-filled sky made filthy by corporate polluters who get tax breaks. 8:00 AM -- Listen to a man who looks like George Bush get pies thrown at him. 9:00 AM -- Hear the sounds of endangered species over the radio dial for an hour. 10:00 AM -- Game Show: Who's More Liberal, with Ted Kennedy and Dennis Kucinich 11:00 AM -- Yelling at Republicans Noon -- "Lunchtime on the Streets," the show where poor people complain that they have no food because the Republicans don't care about them. 1:00 PM -- Three hours of reminiscing about how wonderful Jimmy Carter was. 4:00 PM -- "The day the Republicans ended the world," a radio drama featuring the voices of Barbra Streisand and James Brolin. 6:00 PM -- "You may be eating dinner, but only if you're rich." 7:00 PM -- One hour of reflection: this week, we'll be listening for an hour to a tape of Michael Moore snoring. 8:00 PM -- Listen to someone throwing darts at pictures of Dick Cheney 9:00 PM -- Alternative Family storytime. 11:00 PM -- Obscenity, because the first amendment still exists. For now.
