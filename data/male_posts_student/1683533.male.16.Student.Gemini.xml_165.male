Instead of me talking about it though, I will let you read a previer from  urlLink  Game Informer . .  The movie looks good too.   "Spider-Man wowed us in his first feature film adventure a couple years ago, and likewise, gave gamers the opportunity to swing through the air once again in another console adventure. Well, with the upcoming release of Spider-Man 2, Activision is once again getting geared up to send the web-slinger to home consoles in a game of the same name. If you got sick of the persnickety camera of the last game, as well its somewhat linear and constricting adventure, prepare to enter Spidey heaven. Taking careful notice of what didn’t work in the first Spider-Man game, Activision and developer Treyarch has overhauled the arachnid hero’s next game with some truly innovative and addictive features. But as with any sequel, the question remains: is it better than the first?  While we haven’t seen the latest Spider-Man film, we can say that the game will include quite a bit of content drawn from the feature film. Spider-Man will take on Doc Ock following his ill-fated experimentation with mechanized arms, as well as follow the on-again, off-again relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. But to extend the life of the game, Activision has taken some freedoms in adding quite a bit of different Spider-Man universe content. During your adventures you’ll face off against some classic villains, such as Mysterio and Rhino, as well as run into some unlikely allies like Black Cat. These additions work pretty well in the game, but do seem a bit odd so far since they aren’t directly tied to the film. But if you look at the game as more of a general Spider-Man title, these inclusions are pretty fun and it’s neat to step outside the bounds of the film to take on some classic Spidey villains.   While the first Spider-Man game was a bit linear and featured a lot of “going from point A to point B” navigation, Spider-Man 2 blows the idea of linearity out of the water. First of all, Activision has created an entirely accurate scale model of the island of Manhattan. Nearly every aspect of the island has been recreated in the game, from the Empire State Building to the World Trade Center lights that shine straight up into the sky. If you take the time to climb up onto any tall building, you’ll be faced with a spectacular view. The most amazing thing about that feature is the fact that you can travel to pretty much any area that you can see. Want to snag a web to a helicopter and ride out to the Statue Of Liberty? How about swing through Times Square on your way to Central Park? Well, all of those things are possible.   Fans of mission-based gameplay don’t burst into tears quite yet. The game still does feature a main storyline that involves playing through mission-based levels. The game is essentially broken down into different chapters. At the beginning of each chapter you’re given requirements to fulfill in order to progress to the next one. While there are a ton of chapter-based objectives, the real meat of the game comes in the mind-boggling number of secondary missions. Since you have the freedom to swing about Manhattan at your leisure, you can run into and take part in a wide number of different missions and sub-games. These range from things like taking out pickpockets, delivering pizzas, rushing through the city to meet up with Mary Jane within a certain amount of time, as well as trying to uncover all the hint markers in the game or climb every major skyscraper. If you’re a particularly skilled gamer, you may be able to run through the regular missions in a reasonable amount of time. But it’ll take a truly dedicated gamer to actually complete the game 100 percent.  The game’s mission structure isn’t the only thing that’s gotten a makeover. Swinging through the city has also gotten a facelift, now allowing you to swing more intuitively and with far more control. Web swinging usually begins with a jump, which can now be charged up. Pressing the X button will cause Spider-Man to crouch on the ground, his jumping power increasing the longer you hold it. Letting go of it will send him skyward in a spectacular leap. While in the air, a press of the R1 button (or right trigger on the Xbox) will shoot out a string of web. To keep your momentum going, you need to actually hold down the X button while in mid-swing to build up your swinging momentum. At the peak of your swing, you can let go of the X button and Spider-Man will carry his momentum into the next swing, at which point you need to press the web string button again. It may sound a bit confusing, but after a few minutes, you’ll get the hang of it. Spider-Man is also capable of shooting out two web strings at once, one for each hand. Doing so will cause him to hang in mid-air, which can prove handy when you’re trying to swivel around to face a certain direction. And, Spidey can attach his web to things like light posts and stop lights to hang upside and catch an upside down view on the world.   While handy for getting around, web slinging is also essential for combat. Web can be used to ensnare enemies, making them virtual sitting ducks to take your punishment, as well as used in conjunction with hand-to-hand combat to create some slick attack combos. And this time around, Spider-Man is sporting a virtual arsenal of attacks and moves. When it comes to hand-to-hand combat, Spider-Man is capable of unleashing a widearray of different attack combos, both ground and air-based. The game uses a special “hero points” system of purchasing additional combat moves. Pretty much every mission or objective in the game will reward you with the points, which can then be spent at special stores scattered through the city. In addition to melee combat, Spider-Man can also use his special Spidey sense to slow down time, making it easier for him to put the hurt down on his enemies. I have to give it to Activision; they’ve really spruced up the combat in the game, making it quite fun to bust out some spectacular moves. Ensnaring an enemy in web and then swinging him through the air to knock down his cronies is a blast and something that you didn’t see in the first Spider-Man game.  Visually, the game is looking pretty good and is a noticeable step up from the first game in the series. Spider-Man sports some impressive detail, as do most of the bosses. Regular enemies, however, seem to have gotten smacked with the generic stick. You’ll spend a lot of time beating down baddies that look exactly the same, which is a bit disappointing. Most impressive are the visuals of the entire city itself. While the detail isn’t revolutionary in any way, the technology itself that renders the city without any loading whatsoever deserves commendation. When you do swing in close to buildings, the detail level on them will increase, which is a nice touch.   Audio-wise, Activision and Treyarch have gone the extra mile, enlisting the voice talents of Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, and others from the film. Tobey puts forth the most impressive effort, delivering corny one-liners with a particularly nice panache. Kirsten Dunst, however, seems to deliver her lines with some lackluster enthusiasm, which was a bit disappointing. But, fans of the ever sarcastic Bruce Campbell will be happy to hear that he’s back and providing the voiceover work for the game’s training mode, and dizzying number of hint markers.  Overall, Spider-Man 2 is shaping up to be a nice companion to the upcoming film. Not only does it allow you to take part in key scenarios from the movie, but also lets you take part in some non-film Spidey action.  The new combat system, the sprawling city, and the top-notch voice talent help to ensure that the game is a nice companion to the film. And it doesn’t hurt that the game features some user-friendly controls and a pretty competent camera. So even if you’re planning to wait in line for hours to see the new film, make some time on your calendar for the game. You won’t be disappointed."  -Chris Cook
