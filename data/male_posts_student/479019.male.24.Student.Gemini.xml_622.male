I'm betting that number that just called was a telemarketer. They always seem to call around this time.  I'm guessing some of the posts on my chatterbox are by Brandon. Right? By the way I know you don't like Kung Fu Records, but I just ordered the Kung Fu Records sampler. I needed an extra $5 to get free shipping on the Tower Records' webpage. I ordered that and Joe Strummer's  Streetcore . I wanted to use up my $10 gift certificate. I ended up paying like $11 for 2 CDs... well actually 3, the sampler is 2 CDs. Not too bad.  I'm gonna go to campus in about 15 minutes. I need to read something before class.  I'm listening to  Stiff Little Fingers  before catching the bus.  ***
