In the process of moving, one finds opportunity to discover forgotten treasures of the past.  Lo and behold, I found an old spiral of high school writings.  Before I destroyed the evidence, I saved some gems from it, which I will unashamedly share with my faithful readers.   You can expect to see a few more postings from my high school and middle school writings.  As few of you may be aware, I was the lead singer and guitarist for a punk band called  Sweet Debris .  While we never played any shows as a punk rock band (all of our drummers were fired or quit), I still have some of my masterpieces saved through the notebook.  Today’s sample is my great hit, “ This Day .”  Enjoy. . .    "This Day"    Vs. 1  I tried to miss you, but you were gone too long.  I wanted to kiss you, but you were scared of what might be.  Holding you in my mind... closely... what'll never be.    Chorus  Break my mind.  Change my heart.  Tellin' me, it's all my fault.  Not a word  Can ever say  What you've done to me on this day.    Vs. 2  You're my apathy. You're everything I never cared for.  I tried to play your game, but you broke all the rules.  I showed you my love, and now I'm the fool.    Bridge  Breaking apart...at the seams.  Losing my heart...and my dreams.    I know what you’re thinking: why did John go into philosophy when I should have gone into professional music or creative writing?  Let’s just say I haven’t ruled it out yet.
