Well prior to this I practically spent the whole night wide awake thinking about one person. And yes you guessed it right, Ash. I don't know why considering all that's happened and just being friends and all. Right now I thinking that I think way too much and it just complicates things. I think that messes everything up and idk what else. Feels like I'm going down and all too familiar path. Haha I have no clue why I get like this, I'm thinking I am just 16 and I shouldn't be trying to get all how I am. I need to be carefree and fun and loose. lol but I feel so uptight and I guess that's because I think too much. Oh well Incubus is totally awesome and the album Make Yourself is immensely wicked (britt ;)), I was listening to "I Miss You". Here are some lyrics:  To see you when I wake up is a gift I didn't think could be real to know that you feel the same as I do is a three-fold utopian dream  You do something to me that I can't explain so would I be out of line, if I said I miss you  I see your picture, I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine you have only been gone ten days but already I am wasting away  I know I'll see you again whether far or soon but I need you to know that I care and I miss you (I miss you)   Good stuff I tell ya. Mk well lol after saying all this I don't know what to think. Should I keep myself in this mode or change? I thinking change because I'm getting ahead of myself and over zealous or whatever. I'm gonna calm down and whatever happens will happen. Alright I got to shower see ya later.
