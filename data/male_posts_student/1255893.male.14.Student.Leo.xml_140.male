At least the way she thinks anyway. We both wander aimlessly in our heads linking one thought to another until we somehow end up back where we started. its so awesome.   ave came back today. why didnt i seem as happy about it as i thought i would? im growing up acccordin to my bro. guess he's right. dunno. could be. im through questioning what the fuck it means though. if it had deeper meaning id probably care more.   net's down.. been listenin to winamp5 a lot. i got this MMD3 skin my bro recommended. winamp 5 is so amazing. you can burn cds on it now and like... the added more visualization effects. its also got internet tv and internet radio on the free version which is insane! \m/. ill be usin it often now  all this time devoted to .......sorry. listenin to easier to run right now. Jus got to one of my vaforite verses of all time. "jus washing it aside. all of the helplessness inside. pretending i dont feel misplaced is so much simpler than change" somethin about hearin that jus makes me stop what im doin and ....... bask in its .....sowie again, jus got to faint, damnit. this song's awesome. all LP is. UGH! so much emotion is put into this music......... its like a fucking tornado of passion and angst! makes ya think those kiddies had terrible childhoods. "id see you in every thought i had and then the thoughts slowly found words attached to them and i knew as the escaped away i was commitin myself to em and everyday i regret say those things cus now i see that i took what i hated and made it a part of me." why cant i help thinkin of ave when i fucking listen........ type........ that? more importantly.... why cant i believe im thinkin about her when those lyrics come up? "ive let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you! giving up a part of me ive let myself become you!"  Lj says i should save angst for later ..... like i core... you know? wtvr.... jus ..... wtvr. dont see why i should hold back what i think i feel jus cus he thinks certain things should come at certain times.... jus like the fucking giver. never did like that damn utopia concept. maybe cus i think the worlds so screwed up already that the concept of a utopia seems impossible w/in the next millenia or two.   andrew wondered why I listen to people like vitaly who " try to change the world" ill group myself along w/ him for the sake of this rant. we dont try to change the fucking world. the act is you cant change it. being aware of its imperfections is the next best thing though. once i explained that to him he said" yeah exactly" wtf? dont give me that shit like you think you know. if you did you woulda told me upfront. or maybe i dont know you as well as i think and you wouldntve said it upfront like i thought u wouldve. assumption- a statement accepted as truth without proof.   "things arent the way they were before. you wouldnt even recognise me anymore. not that you knew me back then but it all comes back to me in the end." winamp 5 ......... i cannot imagine my life without you... i ask your hand in holy matrimony "you're a fucking gold digger! you only want my music! you dont love me!" - damn right......... the music's the most important thing.   once again....... in the last lyrics i typed in...... i was thinkin bout ave....fuck this man. i was fucking right in my 12-1 blog post. or maybe i choose to link everything to her cus i havnt grown up... or maybe i have grown up and thats how im supposed to do things - hypocrisy- the professing of beliefs or virtues one does not possess.   "i wanna be pushed aside so let me go. let me take back my life id rather be all alone. anywhere on my own cus i can see the very worst part of you is me." - lying from you, yet another awesome song ....... damnit! i derno....... now i feel emotionless..... lookin for something meaningful to type..... or maybe ive already said what i have to say ....... grrrr...... teenager-of, for , or involving those within the ages of 13 and 19....... the definition doesnt give the word justice.  "all of this stress gave me somthin to write on, the pain gave me something i could set my sites on." - thats better.   am i really qualified to give teenager a definition? its only my second year here and i still gots shit to go through. or maybe im already mentally old enough. mature-fully grown or developed.   "im tired of being what you want me to be. feeling so faithless. lost under the surface. i dont know what you're expecting of me. put under the pressure of walking in your shoes." grrr- ....... GRRR!!  how long is this post gonna be? .......... wtvr ..... not like i gots more of a writting limit than whatever my wrist can take. -numb- unable to feel or move normally  "'less i hear the less you say... you'll find that out anyway." I FINALLY GET IT!   we're only on the L's ladies and gentlemen! wait till we reach the s's. "part of me wont go away, everyday reminded how much i hate it. weighed it against the consequences. cant live without it so its senseless. wanna cut it outta my soul and jus live w/ a gaping hole. take control of my life and wash out all the burned taste. i made the problems in the first place. hang my head low cus its part of me.you hardly see right next to the heart of me .... now im sick of this i cant stand the sandpaper thoughts that grade on my sanity. id rather not even be than be the man thats starin in the mirror through me." angst- a feeling of anxiety...... havnt been usin the right word have i?   daria sure is amazing the 2nd time around. like lots of things we take on prematurely. oh sure you get the hang of it ....... but you miss so much. am i really talkin bout a cartoon anymore. guess not, seein as i was thinkin bout kiddie dating. such a terrible concept. gotta let em come to that conclusion on their own though .... hypocrate- see paragraph 8  "i wanna heal, i wanna feel, what i thought was never real. i wanna let go of the pain ive felt so long. (erase all the pain till its gone) i wanna heal. i wanna feel, like im close to something real, i wanna find something i wanted all along."- optimism- a tendancy to expect the best possible outcome or dwell on the most hopeful  aspects of a situation.    "i woke up in a dream today, to the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor. forgot all about yesterday remembering im pretending to be who im not anymore. a little taste of hypocracy and im left in the wake of the mistake , slow to react .so even though you're so close to me ur still so distant and i cant bring you back" -pessimism- a tendancy to have the gloomiest possible view of a situation, the doctrine or belief that the evil in the world outweighs the good.  im priceless :)  delayed post from 12-22  "its like the mist is what's pretty you know? the gold and silver?" "Mmm hmm" "too bad it cant stay like that all the time" "nothing gold can stay"  "have i waited too long? have i found that someone? have i waited too long .... to see you?"  "The needle on my record player has been wearing thin. this record has been playing since the day you've been with him .....Remember the time we wrote our names u on the wall? remember the time we realised thriller was our favorite song?"  - hit or miss  " so can you see? You're seeing less of me darling. And you're blind to the fact that my heart stopped beating. - sincerily me  "I can't remember the time or place or what you were wearing its unclear about how we met all i know it was the best conversation that i ever had  to this day ive never found someone with eyes as wide as yours ive been searching up and down this coast overlooking what i need the most  did you notice i was afraid? i thought id run out of things to say. two more hours until tonight burns this away and it starts all over again  the sky will never look the same again till you show me how it could be the sky will never look the same again until you show me how it could be  and everything else is irrelevent to the story so far" -the story so far  "Living with me i dont think it would be so bad. This is the first time this year that im not goin to make you mad. Im tired of my conscience always tellin me to stop sleepin. But i cant waste a second on trends that will never begin.  Everyone has their head up on their shoulders. We're losing our pride as we all get older. Everyone has to become their savior. You might not get it right, or you might realise that its too late.  dont back down. im over the past cant you see? dont back down.i dont really care about before before you met me" - never give up  the A's rock...... or is it N's?  delayed from 12-23  pretty awesome day ..... i think. went to the mal w/ roy, nathen, kelley, ave, and some other people i didnt know. had a pretty good time. got to hang out in all the furniture places. i think that was nicest of all. and everyone was being extra affectionate for some reason. or maybe that was jus liz :-p.   we took some pics too. ill post em later on. honestly though...... i think somethin was missin... jus felt either too empty or too crowded. not that i wanted people to go away or anything but ...... i derno. blah. i had a pretty kewl time so im fine  delayed from yesterday  christmas eve... and i dont quite feel like myself. been thinkin bout crap. still dunno what i was thinkin bout though. after i talked to aaron i felt sooo much better though. ima call him...... see what he's doin later on. hopefully gonna have some fun together during break. but thaks to him im back to normal! :-D  today ....  we got a few birthdays on our hands today. happy birthday to ave, diana, and jesus! yep. happy birthday you guys. wish i jus had more to say :-p
