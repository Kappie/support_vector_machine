We lived in a highly influential world and it'll would be against our own human nature not to pursue it, hopefully, we'll still remember where we came from, what we've learnt from our past mistakes, it is rather important, as now, canes are no longer used, NATO(no action, talk only) has taken over. Lets be nice, have the right attitude; live the right way.
