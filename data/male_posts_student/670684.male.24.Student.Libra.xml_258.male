I was always told it was tomatoes and deep green vegetables, but looks like you can keep eating the waffle fries and taco bell if you get the personal groove on.    Also,  urlLink Jerry Springer  is considering a run for a US Senate seat in Ohio, and has filed his name in case he wishes to do so.  This has caused great levity among media and political pundits, including a scathing critique from National Review columnist  urlLink Jonah Goldberg .  Everyone wants to comment on the Springer circus, get the sound bite, because it's this week's Sausagegate or Martha Stewart scandal or Laci Peterson drama or SARS news.  Normally, I'd steer clear of worthless media fodder, except I don't find this worthless.    Because I think Jerry Springer would make a damn good senator.    Let's go to the expected comments section, please:   You're an idiot!  He'd ruin the Democratic party!  -  Brandon Lawson   What the...  -  Dawson Taylor   Expected from a liberal crackpot.  -  Jerromy Falk   Cool, and expected.  I jumped on board the quick quips wagon when I heard about Springer's thoughts on the subject.  Except I had two chances to hear him speak recently...and while I can't find his exact quotes anywhere on-line, I will say his words were impressive and a nice change from the regurgitated yet dilluted Democratic response to Republican bullshit.  Springer understands that his show is a farce, but he also understands that 1) people want to watch it, especially those who love to hate him for it, and 2)  his TV show, as he said,  is not the reason for homelessness, joblessness, a floundering economy, multi-national corporation scandals and tax evasion, and a superfluous war in Iraq .    Both Michael Moore and Barry Glassner make similar arguments in their recent work, based around media effects.  "Journalists" look to their own medium, Television, when assigning blame to the "degredation of society."  And it is expected, because in that statement they are both condemning this technology that many feel is invasive, as well as glorifying their involvement in it, showing their rise above the problems of the medium that we all use and will continue to for the forseeable future.    We watch Springer, and we point and laugh, or we are disgusted by it...either way, it allows us to feel good about ourselves and look past our shortcomings because, hey, we aren't fat and stupid like those people on the show.  Same thing with the media's coverage of many an instance, like Laci Peterson, or the other one from San Diego with the little girl and the interior decorator...I don't recall his name.  Anyway, Springer chooses to indulge our fantasies in a social way that glosses over our problems as individuals.  I've never liked the show, to be honest.  But at least he doesn't gloss over our problems as a nation, as the rest of the hegemonic institutions enjoy doing.  He can promote transvestite fighting all he wants, just get the honest message to Washington.
