Star Trek was good this morning - it's the one where they have to kill the vampire thing - the vampire thing in the cloud - not the salt sucker woman. Two very different episodes. One of the Red Shirts tried to judo chop Kirk - Jim T gave him a punch in the jaw for his trouble.  So Jason's going on about the new Windows XP. Hopefully it will also come with a life for him. Ahem.
