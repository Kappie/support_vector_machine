Well today im babysittin at my usual spot (a huge western style mansion!!!)  and it should be fun, some major cash to be had.  It can give me a chance to finally play Gunbound (the best game ever), Neverwinter Nights (another great online game) and Wolfenstein (awesome possum game).             Last night I emailed my cell phone a buncha new ringers, there was bring me to life by evanescense, trouble by coldplay, and the Zelda theme from Super Smash Bro. Melee. and i also got some new wallpaper for it, an Anya one where she has a sword and looks wicked cool and one of her in her Bunny Suit that says, "Your no bunny, till some bunny loves you," and another of anya (big surprise) and xander with a very cool lookin backround (all blue and such).              OK recently i got the new switchfoot CD with Kat and Garrett and it awesome, i love it.  Some really good songs on it are 24, the beautiful letdown, and meant to live.  Those are my fav's as of now.  Im listening to Dido: life for rent and its sad but good.  My friend Kat and I both love Mary's in India, its a sad song about love lost and new love found, BOOOHOOO.             Well i better jet because i need to finish cleaning my room (from my spanish project, lotsa cardboard scraps).  Talk ta yall later!!!
