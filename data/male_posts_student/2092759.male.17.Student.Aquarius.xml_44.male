I start on the 21st and get minimum wage baby! - Mr. Thompson came to school today and showed off the baby. (As an aside note baby speak, real baby speak spoken by a kid under 5, is the single most melting sound in the world. He told me that the greatest feeling in the world is coming home from class at 6 at night, putting his keys in the door and hearing her yell "DaDa!" from behind the door.) - AP Government might not be the best class next year, but at the very least there will be an abundance of good friends in the class, and it is not humanly possible for the teacher to be worse at her job than Mr. Valencia was this year.   - I found out that I am going to be the Opinion Editor for Smoke Signals beyond a doubt next year. Thats going to be alot of work, but it will be well worth it and will give me a wealth of opportunities later in life. ( i.e. It looks good on an application.) - I found out that theres going to be like 5-6 Bari Sax players next year, including Greg Porter, and I get to be section leader. - I came to the firm conclusion that if I could have one job to pay the bills that involves writing, I really want to write comics for a living. In the end, I think that would the most fufilling job in the world. (If anyone, I mean   anyone  , can draw worth a damn and is willing to work with my warped, sick, little mind please, please, please talk to me over summer.) - The greatest realization of high school came to me: that whole thing about Senior year being easy? Yea, thats bullshit. Next year is going to be fucking hard. But, there in lays the ray of hope. Nothing easy is worth doing, so, i'm inclined to believe that next years going to rip me a new ass hole but itll be the funnest year so far (which isnt saying much I suppose, but none the less.)
