On the way, I realized something: I don't need to hang around with people that bring me down anymore. I was thinking about all the incredible people I've met through God's amazing presence in Wyoming as well as the friendships that have been strengthened to the max through him, and I just realized there are so many people out there that are my friends that I just take for granted.  This last week I've lived for God, and everything else just fell in place. Coincidence? I don't think so.  Welcome back.
