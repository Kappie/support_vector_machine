MiMi and I just sat there for a while looking around and watching them do their thing. The trip down was rough on me. My legs were jello. We are both in some pain today. It was worth it. I saw a ton of hummingbirds and a few birds of prey. Even found an owl pellet but stayed away.  Today I am working a split shift and I have to go back in a short while. I'm on the tired side after eating some lunch. I eat some mexican food down the street and they had these little creditcard style calenders for your wallet. All of them had these elaborate and detailed latin/western paintings on them. I got the one with the aztec prince in headdress holding the sacrificial virgin. haha. I have a shorter day tomorrow. I'm glad, and still stoked about the bird training tomorrow. I want to be that guy that takes the birds to the 3rd grade classes and tell the kiddies about birds and animals and wildlife harmony. We are all on the same earth.   Peace.   current mood:  blank current music: book of dead names - Yo
