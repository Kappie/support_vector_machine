At three and a half plates, I was tied for the second to lowest place, but it was still exciting.  Golden Corral's the best place for it too.  After that we went to Liz's and played Malarky, which I did slightly better at. I've graduated from Leprachaun to Ewok.  Come on Friday, you'll see what I mean.  (Especially if you saw Wizard of Oz). Oh, and new stuff at my other blog, if you want to know. SQ(u)EE!
