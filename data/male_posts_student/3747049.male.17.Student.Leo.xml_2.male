After previous experiences of painting and how much hassle it is I am not really looking forward to my mums nagging. So first stop is to sand down the skirting boards! Now if you have ever used a sander you would know how much effort you have to put into it. It’s like having a dog on a leash that’s trying to run away! How annoying and after a while your hands are like jelly and you will have a hard time feeling anything for the next 20mins. -_-* Anyways the painting \o/ which was simple enough yet more and more coats of paint. So far we have done 6 coats of paint in 3 rooms. And all ive had to eat today is bread! Still at least there was a nice curry waiting for me at the end of the day.   So apart from painting ive been spending the past few days of my summer holidays playing Max Payne 2 and im already on Part 3 and getting close to the end. I really like making use of bullet time to kill my opponents! Eat my bullets vlad wahahahaha!!!!!   The 500 or S60? hmmm What do these numbers mean?!?! Well they are the names of canon digital cameras! I’m thinking of finally getting a digital camera for me to tinker with and ive decided ill go with canon as they are the best but im sorta torn between the Ixus 500 and the powershot S60.  I suppose it depends on the size of the wallet :p.   Ok enough of my yapping im sure you have something better to do! Adios kids.
