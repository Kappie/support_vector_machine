Now, I feel - I don't know, sensory deprived, like everything I feel has been cut in half. I miss waking up and seeing people who I really enjoy being around, people who are smart and wierd and funny and overt and don't bother with any of the ill-concieved social customs that get bolted onto every other aspect of life, like complimenting people you don't like and carrying on empty conversations for hours. And more and more I find myself doing just that, rambling on to people because I want to feel good again. I want to be surrounded with laughter and inane jokes and people being happy. And instead, I'm spiraling into cliches. Heck, even blog rants are cliches. And complaining about blog rants in blog rants. Ad infinitum.  And what, you may ask, triggered this rash of teenage hormone-driven angst? John's blog, specifically the archive from August 2003. I was reading this becuase I couldn't think of anything better to do. So I did. And it was talking about Tom and George and Maddie and Sarah and me in all caps and how awesome all were. And I realized that that was the peak of my life and it is now gone.  Yark, I'm growing for overly-muchful angsty. Some fakeful words'll upper me better.  Nostalgia, nostalgia, nostalgia is not edible, Nostalgia is not edible, Nostalgia is not edible. Nostalgia, nostalgia, Nostalgia in not edible. You can NOT eat nostalgia... (Which is a good thing, I suppose)
