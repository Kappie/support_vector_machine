First off, Ashley, no matter what happens between us, you are always if not my best, one of my dearest friends, (I don't like to say I have a best friend, but if I did, maybe it would be you). That appology you gave me was the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Anyhow, maybe she can forgive me. That's it for now. I'm gonna miss some people so much....I will be the old me soon, I promise.
