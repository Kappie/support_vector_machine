The camera glides toward a light pulsing in the night, then through an open bedroom window, where Harry is hiding under his covers, playing with his wand and hoping to God he doesn't get caught. Wait a minute. Has new director Alfonso Cuaron inserted a sneaky allusion to the private habits of teenage boys into the family-friendly franchise? Cuaron's a warm, chatty guy and not one to dodge controversy—his last film, "Y Tu Mama Tambien," was so graphic that it was released unrated—but there's no way on earth he's going anywhere near this topic. "This is NEWSWEEK, man!" he says, then laughs for a very long time."  urlLink continued...    "The tests revealed the fact that Ruth is 90 per cent efficient compared with a human average of 60 per cent. That his eyes are about 12 per cent faster than those of the average human being. That his ears function at least 10 per cent faster than those of the ordinary man. That his nerves are steadier than those of 499 out of 500 persons. That in attention and quickness of perception he rated one and a half times above the human average. That in intelligence, as demonstrated by the quickness and accuracy of understanding, he is approximately 10 per cent above normal."  urlLink explained...   and finally, just to try to win over those people who think baseball is boring and stupid. with a boring and stupid essay! oh the irony.   The spectrum ranges from bland indifference to wild fervor, from cursory interest to ecstatic loyalty, from ignorant boredom to dedicated appreciation. Arguably nothing in today’s world elicits such a broad range of reactions as does America’s national pastime, the sport of baseball. Revered by boys and girls of over five generations, it has unfailingly inspired teamwork, dedication, and desire in all – winners and losers – who had the privilege to fit a glove onto their hand. Although a miniscule percentage of these potential Willie Mays actually end up donning the uniform of a Major League Baseball team, these children still have the enviable opportunity to stand in that grass and allow 165 years of history to wash over them. Yet, as the clock has turned to the 21st century, rumblings abound regarding the undesirability of newer aspects of the game. Debt-ridden franchises. Shrinking stadiums and home-run exhibitions. Steroids. Is the unwelcome arrival of these modern factors really diluting the classic quality of the game of baseball? However, as 28,055 fans per game can attest, roadblocks such as these are inconsequential – as long as there are four bases, nine players, a ball and a bat, the magic of this noble sport can never die. 	 Baseball has endured so many tumultuous generations of American society because of its unchanging, accessible nature. Due to their limited relevance with the short attention span of our culture, many fads and trends fade throughout the generations as flimsy products wrapped in dazzling packaging. This painful truth has caused many hopeful summer attractions to be tossed by the wayside – limited IMAX theaters, slow scooters and roller-skates, monotonous laser tag games, repetitive beach visits. Countless other possible realms of family entertainment have become so prohibitively expensive that multiple excursions are not an affordable option for many parents. Football tickets easily start at $70 a person, while theme parks usually begin at $50; movie tickets have crested the $9 level while the flicks themselves continue to wither away in the Cinematic Void of Trite Banality™; the exploding popularity of videogames contributes to indolence and unsociability in those who persist in shelling out $50 per disc. Furthermore, excepting the first two examples, all of these costly outings have little true value in terms of family bonding and everlasting memories. It is rather difficult to have a meaningful father-son conversation regarding the excessive amounts of red dye spilled in Kill Bill, and hardly anyone recalls when Yuna reached Level 39 in Final Fantasy X-2. In stark contrast to all these flawed ideas of group gatherings, decent baseball tickets cost $18 each (children’s tickets can go as low as $4), offer families over three hours of bonding time uninterrupted by loud noises and gaudy special effects, and bestow to many needy kids the foreign sight of the sun. While these parents tell their children stories of games they had attended with their own fathers and mothers – of thrilling late-inning rallies and walk-off home runs and classic pitching duels – they are simultaneously creating new memories for their kids to tell someday. In this age of instant gratification, larger thrills and shocking visuals, this intrinsic value of merely going to a baseball game – at such an affordable cost – can not be overlooked.  	 While it is readily noticeable that baseball offers an opportunity for a wholesome family get-together complete with excitement, community and LOW, LOW PRICES, it is slightly more difficult to attain an appropriate appreciation of these visits to the ballpark. After spending much time with an average assortment of adolescent athletes, the impression one generally receives is that football and basketball are by far superior sports insofar as to their suspense and excitement. After all, football has big tackles and long touchdown runs, while roundball presents to its viewers flashy uniforms and titillating dunks. However, as many wizened spectators of spectators will contend, there are few moments in any sport that can compare with two outs, two strikes, one on, down by one. Or a 2-2 count on the 27th batter with a perfect game on the line. Or #660. Baseball has no irritating tension-killing timeouts, irritating tension-killing instant replay, game-lengthening intentional fouls, or chances to call your friends in the end zone. The game only stops between half-innings and pitchers or during rain – otherwise the drama continues. Another incomparable aspect of baseball is its long years of tradition. With the new age of egotistical athletes, old rules are broken during nearly every game of most sports – rookies dunk over veterans, players grandstand at the 50-yard line, lethal punches are unleashed on unsuspecting opponents. On the other hand, baseball overwhelms newcomers with its ageless customs partaken by fans decades ago – the first pitch, choruses of boos to certain deserving players, President Taft’s seventh-inning stretch, “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” standing ovations, the World Series. These traditions of baseball do not change in part because they cannot change, for all possible variables are so masterfully controlled that subtle balance always wins every evolutionary fight. Other sports reward unbounded athletic development – teams with superior size and speed in football and basketball unfailingly prevail. Fortunately, baseball is a much more fickle woman when it comes to her preferred partner. Bring a man too strong, and his bat speed will be pitifully slow and his foot speed even more so. Bring a man too light, and he’ll barely push pitches past those ubiquitous bench coaches. Ingest too many steroids, and his batting form will unalterably change, losing continuity, effectiveness and power. Never vary your tendencies, and infields will shift to ready the double play, while outfielders will shift to catch the easy flyout. Few sports in the American mainstream present to viewers such a perfect meld of strategy and pageantry, tradition and passion, tension and timelessness. 	 Ever since 1839, in Cooperstown, New York, when Abner Doubleday (supposedly) derived its rules from the then-popular game “town ball” – where 20+ boys tried to catch a ball hit by another boy’s bat – baseball has undergone some foundation-rocking revisions. From Babe Ruth’s 714 home runs to Hank Aaron’s 755, from the introduction of the designated hitter to the introduction of Jackie Robinson, from Bobby Bonds’ induction to the 30/30 club to the admission of his son Barry, this sport has definitely evolved throughout the years. Yet with all its rule changes, multimillionaire deals and mascot controversies, through 101 World Series and nine commissioners, after steroids and creatine and THG, baseball has always been – and will continue to be – nothing more than a game with the deceptively simple goal of striking ball with wood. Nothing more than our national pastime. Nothing more than pleasing those fans. As a player once famously said, “A man has to have goals for a day, for a lifetime, and that was mine – to have people say, ‘There goes Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who ever lived.’” What fitting honor for him to be the greatest hitter who ever lived, playing nothing more than the greatest sport ever played.
