I just want some hot days. The only reason I was in today was because well I decided to reinstall my Sims games so I loaded my laptop with the Sims and some expansions. It's been forever since I played that game and I'm surprised I'm back into it. Only problem is that it's so addicting that you end up wasting your day away in front of the computer screen. Sad isn't it? So, I had gymnastics tonight too. There's not too much to say about it. I managed to jump in the pool earlier and it was really warm. It was like 84 degrees. Nice. Reid brought home a drum set from my uncle. This is going to be a pain. I can hear it coming now and I have the feeling it will be loud. As long as I keep my bedroom door shut I should be fine. Rachel is still in Maryland and we're going to pick her up at the end of the week. I've given some thought to me describing the trip in more detail. I didn't really do it justice when I came back. You can tell from the vauge entry a couple days ago. There actually was a lot more to the trip than just rain so I'll describe it on the weekend after we pick up Rachel. That way, I can include the end as well. (Cause we still have to go back one more time you know!) I'm surprised at how non eventful these days are when Rach isn't here. Normally, we would be running her around but now the house seems so much more.....quiet. I know I've repeated this over and over but it's unusual. I've come to the conclusion that this time must be known as "still." Let's just see how long this lasts.
