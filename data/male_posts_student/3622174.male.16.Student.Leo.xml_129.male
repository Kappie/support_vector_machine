This blog now has its own search feature (so you can search for posts that I made without having to go into the archives...its awesome), plus, a new poll of the week, and, I'm nowhere near done yet.  I'm going to be looking around for all sorts of oddities and things to be putting on both blogs.  Bagel.tech is the one that's going to be getting the major overhaul though...I'm exporting all of the custom HTML for my extra addons, so I can re-import them when I get the new skin put in.  So basically, everything at bagel.tech is going to be disfunctional for a while today...but, I'm not sure when.  I'm still planning on putting a new counter, possibly a new guestbook, and something new and awesome that you're going to want to see.  My DVD collection!  Yep, I'm signing up with DVD Aficionado to provide the readers of Blog of Bagel with a look at my collection.  w00t.    Anyway, just thought I'd give you guys a heads up on what's going on, since we're going to be working throughout the remainder of the weekend to provide an even better bagel's blog system.  I want to include more interactivity between the two blogs, and even get started on the design of a new blog, but I have no idea what it would be about yet.  We'll see what happens.  Join me later tonight for some new posts.  But until then, glance cautiously at the new features being put in.
