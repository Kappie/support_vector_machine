In anticipation of seeing the new  urlLink Tom Hanks comedy , I decided to go to my local library and borrow the original  urlLink Ladykillers .  urlLink The Ladykillers  is a classic of British film. I have honestly never read a word about this film to indicate that it anything less than a comedic masterpiece. It has  urlLink Alec Guinness . It has  urlLink Peter Sellers . It was made by  urlLink Ealing Studios , associated with comedy in the same way that  urlLink Hammer  is with horror. So with the giddy anticipation of a schoolgirl, I gathered the family around our entertainment center and popped in the cassette for 97 minutes of fun, fun, fun!  I hated it.  Comic genius? I wouldn't even classify it as mildly amusing. It was like a funny movie with all the funny bits left out. It's an amusing premise -- a group of crooks being outwitted by a little old lady -- and I kept waiting for it to catch fire. But it just kind of stood there and fizzled.  With the girls sick with the disease of the week, my son, N--, and I decided to get out of the house for awhile to give them a little peace and quiet. I took him to the movie theatre hoping to see  urlLink Hellboy , but N-- talked/begged/pleaded with me to let him see  urlLink Scooby Doo 2 . How do you say no to a cute 7 year old? Even if you're going to waste the next 90 minutes of your life watching the latest turd from the Hollywood crap machine?  I loved it.  Yes, I loved it. Even with the gratuitous farting jokes, a "barricading the door" bit stolen from  urlLink Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein , and the sadness of seeing  urlLink Alicia Silverstone  demoted to costarring in a cartoon movie now that  urlLink Reese Witherspoon  gets all her movie parts. It made me remember why I actually liked this cartoon when I was seven. And the monsters, all from the cartoon and made up with today's special effects technology, just rocked. It wasn't a great movie, but it was a fun way to spend a lazy afternoon with my son.  Who'd 'eve thunk it? I hated the  urlLink Ladykillers , but loved  urlLink Scooby . It does have me speculating where it will all end though... Will I stop listening to  urlLink NPR  and pop in a  urlLink Clay Aiken  CD? Will I drop  urlLink Frederick Buechner  and start reading  urlLink Left Behind ? Will I -- gasp --  urlLink vote Republican ?
