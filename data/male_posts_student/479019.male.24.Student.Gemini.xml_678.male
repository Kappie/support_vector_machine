Art History 550E: 8/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 10/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 7/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 37 / 65 = 56.9%  Remaining: 28 pages / approx. 19 days = 1.47 per day   I also had 2 more burritos with some Sprite remix... my favorite soda at the moment.  Today is a good day. I'm gonna watch  The Hulk  now.  ***
