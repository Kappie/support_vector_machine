Then we had to go clothes shopping for Mandy because she wanted a dress, but she got quite a few bits. Then we went to the cinema to see Gothika. It was really spooky... I really liked it! One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Then we went to this place called Nando's and had a really big meal but I couldn't finish it because I was still stuffed from the Chinese a few days earlier. Then when I was walking Mandy to the bus stop I bumped into some of my friends (Chris and Damien) and decided to join them at Ritz. I waited until Mandy got on her bus then walked to the Palace Theatre to meet some of Damien's friends. They didn't show up but they called him and told us to meet him in this bar called Overdraught. Wow - that place is amazing. I really like it. It's like a bar but with good, loud music and sofa's. We stayed and had a drink in there before walking up to the Ritz. Chris and I got in but one of the girls got rejected, so of course, we all had to leave too. We walked up some super long road for ages to some club that was SHUT. So then we had to walk all the way back. We found this underground club and went in there for about half an hour. 2 of Damien's friends left and went to Ritz and Damien and this other girl went on to 5th Avenue so Chris and I decided to go on to Ritz too. First impressions... I hate it. It looks cool, but it's just like one huge, sweaty room. Didn't have much fun. Spent most of the night sitting near the toilets shouting 'EYYYYYYYYYYY!' to everyone who walked past. I was really missing Mandy too. She was in my head ALL night. God I love her. So anyway, we left at about 1.30am and walked to a kebab place and had some food. Then we got a train to the airport and got a taxi home. All of this took around 3 fucking hours. I got home at about 4.00am. I briefly spoke to an upset, angry Mandy on the net before going to bed. So I went to bed and woke up around an hour ago. It's Mandy's 18th today! Hopefully I will get to see her but it sounds like she's too busy. Anyway, I better go. I'm getting hungry now. xx
