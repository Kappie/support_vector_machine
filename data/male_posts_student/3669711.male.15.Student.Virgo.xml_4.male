When that computer was decommissioned from being the 'main PC', it moved into my room.  Yay, i finally had a computer in my room.  My life was complete.  I was armed with the awesome power of windows ME and dial up internet, right at my fingertips.  The dream was short lasted though.  I soon noticed that the 17' monitor was far to large for my tiny desk.  It was promptly moved downstairs, only to be left alone.  It would occasionally get turned on, for random things.   Then my Linux craze started up.  I wanted to test Linux on a machine that i didn't care about, and what PC came to mind, the old clunker.  So, i wiped the hard drive, got out the Debian Linux cd, popped it into the drive, and installed it.  Unfortunately, i must have missed some steps in the install, because there was a 'kernel panic' and Debian wouldn't boot.  Just my luck.    After that, the old clunker just sat down there, OS-less, not really doing anything.  Well, yesterday, my mom told me that she wanted to use it, and i was like ok.  This afternoon has been quite hectic too, running up and down the stairs, getting a mindblowing number of CS's and such.  This was especially hard considering my knee is 'decommissioned' also.  Can't bend that sucker too well.    Well, i formatted using DOS, popped in the handy-dandy Compaq quick restore disk, and it got up to about 72%, and said pop in the 2nd cd.  Well, that was a bit of a problem, since i only had a single cd.  I looked around a little, and finally found one that had '2' scribbled on the paper sleeve.  I popped that one in, and it worked.  Well, Win 95 booted correctly, and i was in business. But i didn't stop there, i also took the extra effort in putting on the overrated  Windows ME.    After the legnthy install process, i promptly changed the ugly desktop wallpaper, and put on a few convince programs, Norton Utilities (1995), Norton Anti-Virus (1995), and Microsoft Office 97.  Ok, so they are a little old, but who said old wasn't good?  Lets just hope that i don't get any of these 'new fangled' virus's.  Lates
