I hang out with Stephanie last night, which was cool.  We went to Borders and saw Colleen McWhinnie there, she's changed so much!  I saw her mom there as well, it was kind of cool since I've known that family for about 8 years now.  Wow!  OK after we went to Borders we decided to hang out at the Millpond.  We were walking all around the boardwalk thingy and the first time we walked around it we saw this 18-ish year old girl and like this 40 year old guy sitting on the bench and I assumed they were father and daughter.  We walked back and they were making out.  It was so wrong, he had to be twice her age.  I noticed it was 11:11 in the car and we both made a wish.  So I got back here at around 11:30 and I settled in and decided I wasn't unhappy anymore.  In fact, I'm happy.  I got up this morning at around 9 and went out for a day with my family.  Well, kinda. It was my Mom, my two brothers, a friend with each of them, and I.  I swear I can control my brothers better than her, and they were getting pretty out of control, so it's a good thing I went with.  Got back here at 4 and have been being lazy until I decided to post a serious entry.  And here we are.  Ooh I decided it's time to announce my favorite band for next week: Rilo Kiley.  Post some comments on the shoutbox or something.  Preferably nothing about me being stinky or uncool.  Calling me cool and/or saying I smell good is accepted.  I'm out.  --Aaron
