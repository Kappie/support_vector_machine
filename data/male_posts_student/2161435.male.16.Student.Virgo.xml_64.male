Muwa...muwahahahahaha! no-one who owns a boat can be poor! The most expensive item I own is my diginity, and I'm rapidly losing that! *does something stupid again* DAMN COUGARS! My french listening exam is soon and I'm pretty darn scared. Listening to the French is never fun. I'm going into town tomorrow which I'm going to have to make the most of as I have to see my Grandma on Sunday. She's lovely but she's so slow and I'm so impatient! I hate me sometimes.
