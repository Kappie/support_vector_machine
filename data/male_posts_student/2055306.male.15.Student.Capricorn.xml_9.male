I pray that everyday you learn something new about God, and about being a leader, and I pray that if it is God will that you be a leader, that He presses that more and more upon your heart. I absolutly agree with you, yeah you can be a fun guy that ever one likes, but if you dont' have God, it's not worth it. And I think that in the end you'll fail at being a leader. I already pray so much for you, but I've noticed it gets more and more detailed the more I get to know you. And I think thats really good. There is no doubt in my mind that you would make a wonderful leader in whatever way God uses you, and I pray that God's strenght and love be upon you as you learn more, and get closer to God. Again I just want to say how happy it makes me that you are so willing to do whatever it is God has in store for you! Keep that up and know that you have so many poeple that love you, and that pray for you everyday!
