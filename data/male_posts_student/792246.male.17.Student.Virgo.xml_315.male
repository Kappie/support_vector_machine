And then I become overapologetic and I blame myself for things that maybe actually aren't my fault, but I'm so guilty I just do it to myself anyways.  They really are my opinions, I just shape them into an attack. What, am I trying to prove something? What's the point of going to such extreme lengths for something so retarded, especially since I'm probably wrong as always.  Everyone is trying to grow up too fast, and I'm left trying to remain immature. Soon hanging out with me will just be babysitting.  I'm not ready to let go of it all, even though I never had a grip. It's like I've never lived.  I'm such an uncaring fuck. And the worst part is that I don't care. Or something. I guess I do because it maybe bothers me, but I don't know that it really does. I enjoy hurting people, but I don't like having people be hurt.  No one can help me, because I'm too stubborn to admit I have problems. Even now I'm convinced that this is just a fluke writing and everything will be fine in the morning.  And it will be. That's the worst. Things always seem better in the mornings. How can anything be that important if by the morning I never care, no matter what it is?  No matter how many life-changing experiences I have, I never change.  Becoming aware of my problems just makes me bitch and whine more, it never makes me want to be different.  I think I'm scared that I don't know how to be anyone else.  But I'm not very good at being myself either.  Why am I so insecure? Why can't this be like real psychology where everything has a reason for it being there? Have I always been so insecure? I always was shy. I guess that's sort of the same. And then it changed into something weirder in high school. I gained confidence, but not security. Like that makes sense. I was able to love myself, but I still was obsessed with how other people viewed me. Hah, past tense. Because it's sooo gone.  It's like, even though my entire life is based around trying to get people to like me, even if I fail I know I'll still love myself. But I'll be miserable.  This is way too therapeutic.
