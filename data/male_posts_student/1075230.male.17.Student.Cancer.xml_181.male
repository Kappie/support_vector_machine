Anyhow, to the main subject, today, I got to go to the univ fair ^^ this meant that I got to leave school at 11am, after I got TTC photo taken. I was somewhat surprised I got permission to go... (my dad was like "you're going to miss school to go downtown?")... but I eventually got a permission to sign out ^^    I didn't actually use that note tho...I don't think my TA was here today, so it didn't really matter. I wanted to go early, but orrin, trisha, janice, joe, annie and hannah wanted to go later (they ended going after football), and clarence, carson, tracy, brian, and brian wanted to go at 11:30. (um... sorry if I missed any names). Anyhow, Karen wanted to go early to, so I went with her ^^    It was pretty cool, but I don't think I was much of a conversationalist during that trip ^^;; anyhow, we met up with the carson group at Tim Hortons. Surprising, they caught up, even tho we left half hour before they did. Umm... it might be that we took Kennedy and they took Finch. I knew we should've taken Finch =P    Anyhow, we all went to the Convention Centre where it was held, and we started getting stuff. I guess I should've really asked more questions about stuff... I only asked about architecture and what courses I needed ^^;; well, I managed to grab lotsa booklets to look at, so I guess I'll check those out and see what interests me.    Apart from the booklet, (keane, renae and victor should take note) several stalls were handing out pens. Nipissing was offering to take polaroid pics for people for free. Ryerson gives out these huge bags to store stuff in, and also pens. And if you ask them about stuff, you also get a cool keychain. You could also get a keychain from Western stall: that's the one I got. There were also magnets. I guess they ran out of mirrors, I heard there were mirrors yesterday. I want to go on the first day of the fair next year ^^;; get more stuff.   Also, next year, I hope to be better prepared with questions. This year I was somewhat bogged down by requests: I got stuff for aaron, dickson, derek and josh too... so it was kinda heavy. Oh, almost forgot, they were giving out free pogos near the entrance of the Convention Centre.   Now that I started to think seriously about university, I narrowed it down from "no idea" to these following choices: computer science/gfx, architecture, education (teaching), some writing job (journalism perhaps?), and maybe some sort of engineering. Still a wide range and pretty vague, I know, but maybe after I peruse through those pamphlets I can narrow even more ^^;;   Most of the time spent at the Convention Centre I guess was walking around, gathering pamphlets, and looking for people. I should spend more time asking next year. Some people spent lotsa time asking those people stuff. I should do that.    I went with the Carson group back to Union Station, and then after that, it was a smooth ride home. Got back a bit past the "4-5" I kinda said I'd be home by, but it wasn't much - like 10 mins, so noprobz. Had to do paper route afterwards ^^;;    ooo, after reading the movies section of the Star, I think I want to watch matchstick men sometime... the girl looks like Killua from hxh! (what with the casual pose with the skateboard). I know it's a fairly crappy reason to watch a movie, but the plot seems fairly interesting too ^^;;   Ah... extracurriculars are starting to pile up... yay ^^... so far chess and CSUNA. Newspaper will come soon, and I predict Dragonboat and Anime will follow soon. Need to prioritize these in case they clash.    I suppose chess would be my #1, since the team depends on everyone being there (I'm being presumptuous: dunno if I'll even make the team), then Dragonboat, then Anime. CSUNA is a 3 day thing, so I don't suppose it'll be too much of a problem, and I'm totally clueless about newspaper.    Um...I actually made a list of extracurriculars I want to join this year: chess, CSUNA, newspaper, anime, dragonboat.... International Night, Art show (not really extracurricular), and maybe swim team (if they have it) and yearbook (if I'm not exploding by then). Fun!   ~Chronos
