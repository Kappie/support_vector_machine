First of all, Bunnie Diehl has decided to  urlLink review  a mainstream song, called Slither  (by Velvet Revolver, I think).  I find the song, though not offensive, to be lyrically lacking (how do you like that alliteration?).  Take a gander over there to see the lyrics.  I find the completely non-sequitur lines of the song to be quite tiresome.  Second, I have several e-mails that I have to respond to.  Lately I have been doing a poor job of keeping up with my e-mail correspondences because of my blog, and that was compounded recently by the fact that my e-mail stopped working for a while.    Thirdly, the U.S. government has handed over power in Iraq two days early!  I will post on this as soon as I can.  For goodness sake, didn’t the government know that they should wait to hand over power until I can write a post?  ;)  This stuff is all great, except for the fact that I don’t have enough internet time to take care of all of it.  My parents installed some parental controls on our computer in order to limit my internet time, since we have broadband.  At press time, I had less than 5 minutes left on my clock, and I had to type the post offline (cutting and pasting to publish my post).    I will try to return to my regular posting schedule as soon as possible.  To get there, I have lots of work to do.      Be blessed! Neo
