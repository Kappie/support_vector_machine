But when i was driving with my friend( yes he's 21) we were two blocks from home and some how i ran over a piece of sheet metal and that completly destroyed one of the tires with a hole about an inch across so back to changing tires again to the spare tire. then last night i went to my freind and used his stuff to change the wheels back off to the stock rims... :-/ so the past week i've had drivers ed every morning but i dont go in til late today because it's my last day or something, but i really don't care because i got more sleep. but i've had a good time with the instructor, he's really nice and KOol. he hasn't said anything i need to change or work on , so i guess that's good right?  well now it's saturday and i got my driver's ed certifacation yesterday, YAY! I have my test shedauled for june 30th at 9am lets all pray that i pass. after shopping for clothes for the summer( sal val) i had to mow the high school before i could do anything else, so i quick did that and trimmed there... i have done this sooo many times this year already it getting boring real fast. after that i worked on my car and washed and detailed it. so now it's all clean but i'll have to work on the front splitter and wheel wells with some touch-up work. after that i went to car show in beaver falls where there were i would say 400+ cars down there and now my head hurts from wanting them all( well except the riced out crx and toyota pick-up) now i'm trying to firgure out what i'm going to do tonight since no one is home and i can't drive YET...
