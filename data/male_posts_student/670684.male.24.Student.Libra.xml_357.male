The bits of a crossword that won't be finished, half a cup of cold coffee water, and a RealOne playlist looped four times.    But quite a crowd:  1)  The father and son tandem sitting behind me, enjoying bagels with cream cheese and the newspaper.  At the counter, the barista handed the little boy his own bagel, and while dad paid for the wares, he did his darndest to unwrap it from its cellophane purgatory.  The bagel, freed from its prison by a toe-headed emancipator, immediately went for the escape, which consisted of a quick move from wrapping to the floor.    The boy fumbled for several moments to pick up his new friend, now in two segments.  Grabbed him, dusted him off, and was ready to eat.  Dad noticed, and didn't have any objections.  But the barista insisted on presenting the boy with a brand new bagel.    Now the boy is covered in more cream cheese than he's eaten, while dad looks over the New York Times.  I don't know if he's reading about Dennis Kucinich...but a Dennis Kucinich support group was here earlier...four people.  Yeah, I want to vote for the guy, but is the four-way campaign rally going to get him the nod in Texas?  Over hometown GW?    2)  The boyfriend and girlfriend at the far end, guy drinking a coke from Burger King, girl reading an old paperback.  I checked out her ass when she came in, and I don't blame myself for it...she's wearing ass-looking black pants.  She caught me, but decided to spend more time looking at me than the requisite  stare.  scorn.  look away.   I assumed interest, except I wasn't interested in the ass or the girl.  Then her boyfriend came in, and now he's playing snake on his phone while she works.  Earlier they were looking at each other.  And it's just a look, but no one looks at me like that these days.    3)  hottest.  girl.  ever.  I'm a sucker for wavy hair, and the Maura Wilbur look-alike across from me has me playing Queer Eye, wondering how she got her hair like that.  I'm not interested in my hair looking like that, I'm flummoxed by hers.  It's gorgeous.  And she's right across from me...all I must do is look above my laptop and there she is, looking at her iMac, with a colleague of pedestrian looks.  I think they're law students, or social workers.  I've got a shot with social workers, not with law students.  But the Sarah Plain  Tall is wearing scrubs???  Elven angel is wearing a v-neck red shirt, don't know the fabric because I don't know fabrics, but it's a stretchy shirt, and it's got a little give when worn on her, a good accentuator of her features, which I can't see a lot of because she's looking down at her computer.  Her nose is glorious though.  And how do you explain a nose?  She just started talking, right when a Peter Cetara song on the playlist started, a song that I could loop for an hour and enjoy.  Not the best voice ever...kind of Fran Drescher without the nasty Brooklyn accentuator.    This is the kind of girl that you'd walk right up to just to say  I think you're the most beautiful person I've ever seen , and then meekly remove yourself from consideration.  And I haven't ever done that.  Some day I will.  If pedestrian wasn't there, maybe.  Of course, I'd have another excuse at the ready were pedestrian not around.    ADDENDA - I remember a TV show about lovers in Paris, back 1994 or so.  My sister and I ridicule the show to this day for a terrible line at the end of the pilot, where the guy traces the girl's face with his finger, stopping above her lip.  kiss.  He looks at her intently --  you have a beautiful flume .  Awful line.  But a beautiful flume.
