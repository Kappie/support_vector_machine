The stars go waltzing out in blue and red, And arbitrary blackness gallops in: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade: Exit seraphim and Satan's men: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I fancied you'd return the way you said, But I grow old and I forget your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.)  I should have loved a thunderbird instead; At least when spring comes they roar back again. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. (I think I made you up inside my head.)"  -Sylvia Plath [taken from Del's blog (:]  So tonight, well I just received a letter from the Jurong Police Division notifying me that my wallet has been found -beams- its a good thing isn't it! after so long, holding on to my hope. My parents finally found out, because they were the one who read the letter and told me I had a letter from the Police. Owells, its still a good thing they finally got to know what happened even though Dad said most prolly the cash is gone, well if it is it doesn't matter now cuz I've got more important things inside than money. I'll prolly head down to the Jurong West Police Post to collect it tomorrow, or by this week.  Things do seem to be getting better -grins-  School was as usual, I'm getting used to it, almost one month already (: Well, we got to school at 9 this morning, supposed to have our semestral project briefing; save our works on Htmls and our personal web page on a disk and show Mr HAM. But it turned out in the end that I spent 3 wasteful hours last night to do my project because he said, he will check it next time since most of us didn't know what and how to do. A mere 20 mins and there was nothing else to tell us so we had 3 hours off till the next lesson at 12. I could have done with some more sleep at home but NOOOOOOOO we had to come to school at 9 for 20 mins. Bleh. We had C programming and for the first time in Mr Khor's tutorial I fell asleep, well almost because I was struggling to keep my eyes open. Digi Electronics was alright, practical can be fun actually except I was a little lost at the beginning.  Me, Jon and Xing hanged around Food Junction after lesson cuz Jon was gonna go for his Driving at 440, so basically we stayed around before I headed home. I forgot to buy my dinner on my way back cuz mum was gonna be late so in the end, I cooked my own dinner (: hehe, not bad too.  I'm feeling better with every passing day, being more positive about certain things and everything I believe in. I'm tired, and sleepy but happy tonight (:     you wished upon a star, believe in it wherever you are           wonderful tonight.
