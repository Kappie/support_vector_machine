I rushed to the nearest shop to find a mirror…Mc Donald’s was the closest and I barged in and knocked a few plates out of customers who were walking to a table…I didn’t care….they were the least of my problems…my looks were everything…everything!  As I neared the guys’ toilets I kicked the swinging door open not bothering to check if anybody was behind it…Frantically I rushed to the nearest mirror to inspect my face…to my relief nothing was wrong…the same sexy face peered right back at me…  It felt great to see a handsome guy stare back at me…I sighed to myself feeling better than ever…I decided to brand that girl a lesbian since she didn’t seem the slightest bit moved by my good looks…  Slowly I strolled over acting cool to the door of the guys’ toilets…I must have tripped on some water and I fell flat on my face…my world felt like it had crashed right down, how embarrassing…silently I cursed about that girl who had knocked into me…as my eyes adjusted and I attempted to get up a foot slammed right onto my back…I winced in pain…What the hell was going on…who ever did that was going to pay…my shirt was ruined…and even worse he could of made me permanently retarded with an imprint on my perfect body!!! Who would want me now…  ‘Who the hell are you?!’ I demanded in pain as I lay on the tiles smelling the disgusting odor of urine…  I turned my head a few inches to the side to see who to blame…a tall figure peered over me…his face was red and he seemed like he had just had a swim in the toilet bowl…  ‘The guy behind the door when you kicked it open’ he said with an evil smirk on his face…  Uh-oH…I’m in trouble now…I thought to myself…again I cursed at that bloody girl who hadn’t noticed me…if it wasn’t for her than I wouldn’t be in this mess right now…with an extremely bulky guy hovering over me with heaps of tattoos everywhere you could imagine…  I had to admit…it didn’t seem like I could take this humongous mass of muscle on…I mean…I was pretty strong myself but this guy was so massive he could flatten me…the odds were great and it didn’t look pretty in the end…  If you can imagine me…a beautiful faced guy walking into the gents toilets in a hurry…and then me, walking out like I had just being bashed to a pulp and had my head flushed down the toilet…it wasn’t pretty…believe me…  As I walked out…for the first time in my life I felt ugly….all the girls turned to look my way…this time it wasn’t because of my charming smile or killer looks…but the stench of urine all over me and the numerous bruises I had all over my face…  Like a zombie I made my way out, slowly lugging my tired body out Mc Donald’s until somebody approached me…  ‘Excuse me sir…’ a man asked…he was wearing the Mc Donald’s uniform and he had a badge on the left side of his chest labeled ‘manager’….  Drowsily I turned my head signaling him to go on…  ‘I’m sorry but the customers have complained about you…I’ve been informed that you knocked over their food while you apparently rushed into the gents’ toilets…’ he said in an accusing tone…  My heart began to thump…don’t tell me he was going to make me pay…I groaned to myself not wishing to part with my money…  ‘Umm…you have the wrong guy’ I said quickly while I motioned to the door again like a zombie….  He held me back with his hand before quickly withdrawing it away in disgust…my shirt was soaked in toilet water…it didn’t smell nice at all…  ‘Please sir…if you would kindly pay the amount of $30.00 for the food that you spilt it would be appreciated…please don’t lie to me or I’ll have to take you to the police station…I can understand that you had a major case of diarrhea or something like that but the customers want justice…’ the man said…  I was horrified and extremely embarrassed…they think I had diarrhea!!!...OMG…my swollen face turned even redder than before…I wanted to get out of Mc Donald’s as soon as possible but seeing as the stupid manager wouldn’t let me leave I quickly rummaged through my pants pocket to find my wallet…  To my horror and shock I couldn’t find it anywhere.....i checked both pockets of my baggy jeans and to no avail I found nothing…not even my cell phone was in there…my eyes widened in shock as I began to panic…what the hell was going on…this wasn’t the best day obviously…  The manager’s piercing eyes made my forehead drip with beads of sweat…he impatiently waited for me to pay the fee…while I rummaged for my wallet…where was it?!  Finally I gave up…slowly I withdrew my hand from my pocket and gave the manager a nervous laugh…he stared at me obviously not impressed at all while he tapped his foot continuously on the freshly mopped tiles…  ‘Hold on…I seem to have left my wallet in the bathroom’   I made a bolt for it to the bathroom hoping that my wallet was there…I clearly recall that the bulky guy hadn’t taken my money…or my cell…when I reached the bathroom I slowly pushed the door open which made a squeaky sound from the old hinges… I searched in every toilet dorm and every table sink…nothing…nothing…that’s when I remembered that lesbian girl…urgH….silently I cursed to myself coming up with the conclusion that she had mugged me when she bumped into me…damn her!...  I glumly walked out of the gents’ toilets and back to the awaiting hands of the manager…today just wasn’t my day at all…first I get bashed…then told to part with my money…and now I find out that I’ve been mugged…I sighed to myself not feeling good at all…if I ever see that girl again she’ll pay….  The day didn’t turn out as I had planned…the manager made me work off the $30 I owed…I didn’t do much of a good job though…I practically slowed down his business and I drove the customers away with my fowl stench…I felt like I was on show…all these hot girls walked in and out of Mc Donald’s pointing at me and laughing…I promised myself I would seek revenge on that girl if it was the last thing I did…    CHAPTER 2  [Ben's P.O.V.] At the end of the day I was fully exhausted…I drove home to my apartment and tiredly opened my apartment door #463…as I got in the lights were already on…now what is it? As a frown appeared on my face…this just wasn’t my day to get burgled…then I heard laughter…the T.V. was on…  My eyes widened in panic as I got a nearby beer bottle from the table that I had finished off last night…slowly I crept beside the wall and neared the T.V…who ever it was, they were pretty stupid to laugh so loud in my home…  ‘HAHAHAHAHA’ the laughter rang through my whole house…  Just as I was about to strike…something stopped me…wait a second…that laugh sounds familiar…I scratched my head in deep concentration…where had I heard that laugh from…that same high-pitched girly laugh…Tonti!!!...  I smirked to myself knowing I had got him this time…as usual Tonti, who lived right across from my door had let himself in again…his T.V. was broken and knowing Tonti he was to lazy to get it fixed…he had a room mate too…Jake…we were all friends around here…our other buddy’s lived a few doors down…the short guy. Rainer lived at #465… Blue was at #466, right next door to Tonti and Jake and Retchi lived with Blue…he was the baby out of us…  I thought of an evil plan and smirked at myself thinking I had got him this time…slowly I crept behind the living room couch and switched the light off…Tonti just sat there dumbfounded wondering what was going on…  That’s when I pounced on him…  ‘ARGHhHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! RAPIST!!!’ Tonti yelled at the top of his lungs…  I covered his mouth with my hand trying to muffle his sounds…this was way too much fun...knowing Tonti…he kicked and screamed like a baby trying to fight me off…  ‘SMELLY RAPIST!!!!...HELP!!!! HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’ He yelled again…  He must have escaped from my grasp…his screams were so screeching I would of punched him in the face if he wasn’t my friend…suddenly somebody pounced on me and threw me on the ground….  ‘ARGH!!!’ I shrieked as I landed on the floor with a thud…I grabbed my side, aching in pain…what the hell was going on…who was that?...  ‘Get him!!!’ Tonti yelled…  Somebody threw a blanket of some sort over my face as I yelled in astonishment…what the hell?...  Now it was my turn of torture…Somebody pounced on me while I was still in shock…and I’m guessing Tonti joined in…  ‘AHHhHH!!! Get OFF!!!!!!!!!!!’ I yelled threw the blanket as they started beating me…  Tonti was going to die for this….  Between the blanket and the other two…I could hear faint sounds…they seemed to be talking about me…  ‘What are we going to do with the burglar?’ a guy said…he sounded like Jake…  ‘I don’t know…who ever he is…he sure is dangerous…did you see that?!! He almost raped me for God’s sake!!! He’s probably been stalking me…who knows…even fantasizing!!!’ Tonti shrieked in panic  ‘I don’t know…should we call Ben and tell him about the psycho?’ Jake said not knowing what to do…  Obviously he was over exaggerating like usual…I sighed to myself before taking a deep breath…  ‘SHIN TONTI AND DHONGWAN JAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET YOUR FAT ASSES OFF OF ME BEFORE I BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU FOR RUINING MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’ I roared at the top of my lungs…  I must have startled the two and they immediately jumped off of my ribs enabling me to breathe in regularly…  I pulled the covers off of my face as the lights soon turned on and blinded me…as I adjusted to the light I met the gaze of Jake and Tonti wide-eyed and mouths dropped at the sight of me…  ‘BEN!!!!!!!!!’ they both cried in unison…  ‘WHAT?!’ I said back rather rudely…  ‘d-did we do THAT….’ Tonti said while glancing at Jake then back at me…  I groaned to myself and got up with a heavy sigh…this just wasn’t my day…Tonti followed me along with Jake…they continued to observe my face taking a good look at the bruises that I got from the bulky guy in the gent’s room…  I ignored there stares and went to the bathroom to have a long shower before going to bed…today was a long day…and if I ever saw that girl again I’d show her a piece of my mind…     CHAPTER 3  [Nicky’s P.O.V.] Before I went to work…I noticed a stupid looking guy walking towards me...he seemed like the perfect person to mug…I mean…don’t get me wrong…It’s not as if I want to steal from anyone…it’s because I have to…ever since I left the orphanage and when times are hard I have to do it every now and then…it sure beats being a whore…  When I ‘accidentally’ bumped into him he called me sexy…I mean...what sort of a lame pick up line is that…little did that bimbo know that he had just been mugged…I smirked to myself as I thought of what had happened…  After I took his wallet and cell phone I rummaged through his wallet to find out his name was Benjamin Uy…he seemed like a rich guy judging by the way he walked…soon I found out I was way off…WHAT?! Only $5?!...this guy must be a pimp if he only has 5 in his wallet but dresses like a rich ass…what an idiot…  Of course I was disappointed to only see 5 bucks…I mean…how was that going to pay for the rent that I owed…I frowned to myself as I thought about what I had did… mugging someone who was as poor as me…I felt guilty….  I went to work at 11:00pm…the usual time…well the pay was good…but I always got it late…which wasn’t very good…what could you expect for being a ‘bar girl’…I worked at Crystal Bar…I don’t know why I took the job though…I guess I was desperate…the people there were alright and they treated me pretty nicely…but that wasn’t enough…after all…I did lose my dignity…  I worked till early morning until 4:00am…it was always like this for me…I was always the fill-in girl as well if people were busy…I needed all the money I got…and that was only for the rent and bills that needed to be paid…the grueling hours at work were endless…constantly being harassed and hooted at wasn’t what I pictured my dream…I don’t think it would be any girls dream…  Some guys offered me some cash…but of course, knowing guys…they always wanted something in return…I cherished that little bit of dignity I had left in me though…never would I stoop so low…I told myself…so that’s how I came into the stealing business…I only did it occasionally when times were hard…  After a while of thought…I decided to sell the wallet…I easily sold it to a stupid guy who paid $50 for it…I grinned to myself happily…knowing $50 would last me a while…I got $100 a night for working and I went to work every chance I got…I guess you could say that would be more than enough…but to me…it wasn’t…I hated the job but it kept me alive…I wanted to create my dream….to create a future for myself…to start new and go to college…to get a decent job…  When my shift was over I went home to my small apartment….i punched in the number code and slowly dragged my tired body up to the elevator…I pushed in the 5th level as the doors closed…  When I finally reached the right floor I slowly pulled my body forward while leaning against the wall half asleep to #005 my apartment number… when I got in, I managed to make it to my bedroom and I slumped on my bed….i was so tired…it was how it always was…I fell asleep….  When I woke up it was 3:00pm…I yawned and stretched my arms out feeling more refreshed…I still had make up on my face and my hair was all ruffled up…scratching my head lazily I walked out of my room to come face to face with my living habits…I groaned to myself remembering that I had said that I would clean it up yesterday…  On the floor were scattered clothes and a few empty bottles and chip packets…on the table was more food and a couple bits of scrap paper…the kitchen sink was a mess with dirty dishes that had been there for God knows how long…I frowned at the disgusting sight…I never noticed how gross it looked…  Immediately I set to work cleaning everything up…first I picked up all the empty bottles and chip packets before throwing away the scrap pieces of paper…I borrowed a vacuum cleaner from my next door neighbour who was a kind old lady…I got to work in getting every corner and crevice clean…  I stepped back to admire my efforts…I had to admit, it looked pretty good…I smiled at my achievement before I glanced at my watch…9:30pm….I frowned at how fast time had past…soon I’d have to go to work again…I sat on my couch and switched on the small T.V. I possessed…aimlessly I flicked the channels and found my favourite show on…Friends…after the show finished it was 10:30…I slumped on the couch comfortably for a while before I decided to make myself something to eat…  Taking out a pack of Nissin noodles I poured some hot water inside a bowl and covered the top with the foil…while I sat on a nearby stool waiting for the noodles to soften I drummed my fingers while staring at the clock…tick…tick….tick…it was so boring…  When it had been 5 minutes I opened the lid staring at the steaming hot noodles…my eyes lit up as I breathed in the delicious smell…mm….yummy…  After I finished my meal I wiped my mouth with my sleeve and gulped down the last of the scrumptious noodles…I turned to the clock again and saw that it was 11:45 now…  Quickly I grabbed my jacket and ran out of my house to Crystal Bar…I didn’t have a car so I had to go everywhere by foot…when I finally reached my destination I huffed and puffed loudly trying to catch my breath back…I glanced at my watch…11:55pm…I gave out a sigh of relief knowing that I wasn’t late…  When I entered the bar I was greeted with the usual loud disco music and heavy smell of liquor that always came my way…the smell was so thick it made me feel like vomiting the first time I worked here…but now it was a usual routine…  I greeted the bar tender who was also my boss and went to the back to get changed…busily I searched for number 7 on the clothes rack…I managed to find it right at the end and I undressed to my undergarments…when I put the skimpy outfit on I felt bare and naked…I had never gotten used to that…the uniform barely covered any part of my body…it was an extremely tight, not to mention short mini skirt with a tube top which showed my belly button…  I sighed to myself and began to apply make up…there was even a special method for applying it on…I was told to apply a large amount of bright red lipstick to match my outfit with a lot of blush on the cheeks…I might not be a whore…but I sure feel like one…  After I finished with my make up I walked out of the dressing room back to the crazy drunks outside…I envied the rich guys and girls who came here…they came to party, drink and go wild…they had no idea what kind of future they were throwing around…of course there were the occasional girls would make rude remarks about me…they always insulted the less fortunate people…they made me so angry…once I slapped one of them…the boss warned me if I ever did that again I’d get fired…as much as I wanted to lash out at them, I needed the job for the money so I kept quite…they would always refer to the less fortunate as… ‘People like you’…  After I served a few more beers and to people at tables a group of guys walked in…I noticed one of them instantly…the guy I had mugged…suddenly I began to panic but I kept my cover and went around serving beers to people while I secretly eyed them making sure I was a far distance from them…  The bar tender told me to serve table 4’s drinks...and I quietly obeyed taking the order and walking towards number 4…to my shock and horror…it was that idiot’s table…  I quickly placed the drinks on the table and briskly walked away…I let out a deep sigh of relief thinking I had gotten away with being caught….until…  ‘Hey…you with the red mini skirt….come back here…’ it was that idiot’s voice again…  Beads of sweat began to drip from my forehead and my heart began to beat faster and faster…slowly I turned around hoping he didn’t remember me…    CHAPTER 4  [Ben's P.O.V.] The guys and I decided to go to Crystal Bar the next day…I gave Tonti and Jake the impression that they had damaged my face…they wanted to make it up to me and take me out…obviously I agreed, who would pass up the opportunity of FREE drinks?...besides, my wallet and phone was stolen…  I’m a cheap guy…yes, I can admit it…to myself of course…not to anyone else…well, yes I flirt but I don’t buy drinks for girls…I expect them to buy drinks for me…hahaha…I mean, why should I buy drinks for girls…it’s meant to be the manly thing but most girls who hang around bars are usually rich anyway…they can afford to part with their money…  I’m not in debt or anything…I just don’t like wasting money…I don’t know why…I just don’t…  When the guys and I finally arrived at Crystal Bar…the place was lively with the smell of liquor…people were shouting at each other trying to get a decent conversation starting over the loud DJ music and cheerful screams of young, under-aged girls…  This was my style…where I belong…I’m the heart of the party…all I have to do is bust a few of my moves and the girls will be hovering over me like I’m God…this was my life…I was the life of the party…   Jake and Tonti ordered the beers for us…all the guys were here…including Rainer, BLue and Retchi…  The bar girl that came over was really hot…I smirked to myself while thinking I had gotten the girls attention…no, wait…not thinking…knowing…  To my surprise and astonishment…she placed down the drinks on the table and left…she didn’t even collect the bill…I called out to her and she stopped in her tracks…for a while I thought she was shocked that I, Benjamin Uy had noticed her and she was flattered…I smirked to myself...satisfied that I still had the charm…  I waited for her to grasp the concept that she had been addressed by ‘me’ so she could turn around…  Finally she turned around but her head tilted downwards avoiding my eyes…as if she was scared of me…slowly she walking towards my table with the guys again…there was something unusual about her…I felt like I had seen her from somewhere…somewhere recently…but I couldn’t quite pinpoint when…  ‘Aren’t you going to collect the bill?’ I asked her, still trying to remember where I had seen her before…  She remained silent not moving an inch…then after a few moments she spoke…  ‘$13.85 please’ she said in a small muffled voice…  Tonti had to lean closer to hear her…he sighed loudly seeming fed up…I guess he was in a bad mood because of earlier on when Jake and him had versed each other in rock, scissors, paper to see who had to pay the bill…obviously Tonti lost …the bar girl noticed his actions but said nothing and kept quiet…she most probably assumed that he was annoyed with her…  Her voice sounded so familiar…I was on the brink of finding out where I had seen her before…but I just couldn’t remember…  ‘I guess your new here…I don’t know why a girl like you is doing here but next time, don’t forget to collect the bill or you’ll be in trouble with your boss…okay?’ Tonti said…noticing that he had acted rather rudely before…he gave her a warm smile after handing her the money…  That’s it!!!...I know who she is!!...that girl who had mugged me…I smirked to myself knowing I had got her this time…I opened my mouth to show her a piece of my mind, when she interrupted…  ‘That’s right!!! You wouldn’t know anything about why a girl like ‘ME’ is doing here so mind your own bloody business!!! .you don’t even know anything about me…you have no idea…all you guys are just a bunch of rich assholes who don’t appreciate the great advantages you have in life!!!’ she burst out in aggravation…emphasizing the word ‘Me’ as if Tonti was judging her…  Tonti's eyes widened in shock at how the girl had changed all of a sudden…first she was quite and seemed unsure of herself…but now she was fired up…I was surprised myself…  'L-look…I didn’t mean it that way okay…and please don’t assume we’re that kind of people…you don’t know us…and we don’t know you…’ Tonti said calming down a little…  Tonti and Blue could manage their temper so easily out of all of us…Jake was quite calm but he had a temper problem sometimes…  Rainer became cold and distant ever since he lost his girlfriend Eugene…she was murdered and he was there when it happened…he’s never been the same ever since…at that time he kept rambling on about remembering his past life or something…he was adopted when he was small by Derek’s parents…he used to live with Derek, his adopted brother...but he decided he needed some space and moved into an apartment next to us guys…  I don’t have a temper problem…but I can get rather cocky when I’m in a bad mood…and I really want to show that bar girl a piece of my mind…not to mention get my wallet and cell phone back from her…  The girl’s annoyed expression soon calmed down to a frown crease on her forehead…I figured that she new Tonti was right and now she was regretting what she had said rather rudely…  This time it was my turn to have a go at her…but I wasn’t going to be nice or polite to her like Tonti was…this time it was going to get messy…  I stood up from my seat and confronted her, putting on my meanest face ever…I had practiced my ‘mean’ face in the mirror before…I new what I looked like to other people when I had the expression on my face…my forehead was creased and my eyebrows arched inward…  Once I had showed Rainer my ‘mean’ face asking what he thought…ever since Eugene…he had developed the most coldest and cruelest expressions you could imagine...the feedback I got from him wasn’t very nice though…his exact words were… ‘You look constipated like your dying to go to the toilet…now go away’…  With that he walked away leaving the rest of the guys laughing their heads off and clutching their chests trying to suppress their laughter…I wasn’t very happy obviously…but I knew better then to mess with Rainer…he was deadly when in a bad mood…but he was scary almost all of the time…none of us guys messed with him…we knew better than that…  Snapping back to reality…in front of me was a blank expression coming from the girl…    CHAPTER 5  [Ben’s P.O.V.] ‘WHAT?!’ she soon snapped at me noticing my unwelcoming facial expression…  I had to admit…when she was annoyed or angry…she looked hot…but I was never going to tell her that…I wouldn’t give her the satisfaction…  ‘Don’t ‘what’ me girly...give me back my cell phone and wallet!!!’ I yelled back at her annoyed at the disrespect she was showing…  Not to mention if any hot girls were watching right now…they would lose interest in me because I was shouting at a girl…which wasn’t manly or gentlemen like at all…but who knows…I might catch the attention of some girls too…some chicks like to see a man being dominant…I smirked to myself thinking of the up side of this little shouting contest…  The bar girls face became as white as a ghost…I guess she knew I had got her there…gathering up her senses she spoke again…  ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about…leave me alone!!!’ she said motioning that she was leaving the scene…  ‘Don’t think you can get away so easily you lesbian!!!…not this time…I’m not as stupid as you think…you know EXACTLY what I’m talking about!!!...Come back here...and give me back my stuff you thief!!!’ I yelled at her retreating figure…  She stopped moving and turned around…by now the whole bar had gone silent and everyone was listening in on our conversation…our voices were louder then the DJ music…all eyes were on the girl now…I guess she didn’t like the spotlight…I smirked to myself knowing that I had the upper hand this time…  ‘HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A LESBIAN…HOW WOULD YOU KNOW YOU SICK PERVERT…LEAVE ME ALONE!!!’ she yelled back in aggravation…  I don’t believe this girl…she knows exactly what I’m talking about and she still denies it…how stupid…Jeez…what an idiot…it’s a shame that she’s hot though…  I was about to yell back at her when the boss came across hoping to break up the brawl that we were having…I guess he had noticed that the whole bar had gotten silent and all eyes were on his bar girl and customer…who was obviously me…  ‘Alright…calm down please…what seems to be the problem…?’ the man said…making eye contact with the bar girl more then me…  It was clear that he addressing me though…  ‘Tell that lesbian of a bar girl give me back my things…she stole them the other day…!!!’ I ordered him…obviously unhappy…  The boss nodded to me…signaling me to wait a few moments while he discussed the situation with the lesbian girl…  After a few moments of small mumbles and whispers…the girl carried a smirk on her face…what was going on?...  I looked at the boss of Crystal Bar demanding an explanation from him…  ‘My employee tells me that she has never met you before…and that you tried to assault her a few moments ago…and your story is a way to cover up your harassing…’ the Boss informed me…  By now I was fuming with rage…what the hell?!!...assault her?!!...I’m not that stupid…Jeez…who does this guy think he is…and who does she think she is?!...no wonder she had such a smug look on her face…URgh…damn that girl  ‘BULLSHIT!!!...she’s making shit up!!!...if she doesn’t return my things I’ll sue your bar for all it’s worth!!!’ I said in a threatening voice…all the other guys joined in and supported me saying that the girl was making things up…  Of course I don’t have a lawyer…but it’s not like the guy knows that I don’t…besides…he wouldn’t jeopardize his business reputation would he?...I smirked secretly to myself knowing that I would get what I want…  The boss’s forehead creased in stress and he frowned desperately trying to find a solution…after a while…he let out a sigh of defeat…  ‘Alright…alright…but my employee says she didn’t take anything of yours…what do you propose I do?’ he asked me trying to negotiate…  This time it was my turn to put a smug look on my face…I knew exactly what I wanted and she couldn’t stop me now…no one could…  I scratched my chin which was forming new stubs…I smirked to myself...knowing that everyone’s attention was on me...and the fate of the girl was in my hands…even the bar girl remained silent waiting for me to decide her fate…she knew she had lost…and I knew it too…this was too much fun…  As the anticipated waiting continued…I decided to break the tension…  ‘Fire her’ I said flatly…with an evil look on my face…  He turned around to face the girl…obviously delivering the rejection…the girls face fumed with hatred and annoyance towards me…with her cold eyes she looked at the bosses frown and creased forehead.  ‘FINE!!!...I quit anyway!!!!’…with that she stormed out and grabbed her things…  After a while...everything died down and people began to dance again…I was right…I had caught the attention of more girls than I had imagined…they must of automatically assumed that I was rich and powerful...if I could sue the bar for all it’s money…I was loving the attention and devoured every single bit of affection or lustful stare given my way…  This was too good to be true…I was surrounded by so many hot girls…and then came the saying in my head again…one that I had always told myself…  ‘I…Benjamin Uy…am literally a chick magnet…’    CHAPTER 6  [Nicky's P.O.V.]  can't believe that prick!!! Who the hell does he think he is?!   This just isn't my day…getting fired because of that a*shole!!!...  He just made me so mad…if I ever see him again…I swear he'll get a piece of my mind…and I'll make sure it doesn't end pretty...  I grinded my teeth together in rage and formed fists with my hands…bystanders stared at me like I was a psycho…I didn't blame them though-picture this…I'm walking in God knows how high, platforms with an extremely tight and short mini skirt with a tight, revealing red tube top to match…  A guy hooted at me and whistled…my eyes fired up with rage and I shot him a cold, evil glare…his face went deathly white and he backed away from me not wishing to get involved…  I scowled at him menacingly and stormed off in an extremely pissed off mood…that loser at the bar was going to pay…I don't know when, but I was going to make sure he was going to pay…now how was I going to pay the rent that I owed with no job…  I stopped in my tracks…I'm not going to put up with this…why should he get away with ruining my life…he was going to pay…all I am is all talk and no action…I should make him pay shouldn't I?...I smirked to myself wondering what evil plan I would come up with…  'Nice legs baby!' a guy hollered at me…while whistling…  I snapped out of my thoughts and glared at the guy with cold, glassy eyes in a threatening way hinting him to back away if he knew what was good for him…  'Reow!!!...Feisty…I like that in a girl!' the prick said in a seductive tone trying to impersonate a cat…  I was beginning to lose my temper with him…he picked the wrong day to mess with me... 'How much you charging?' he said in a dirty tone…  By now I was fuming with aggravation …my eyes were fired up with annoyance and anger…what the hell…he thought I was a whore that A**hole!!!...  'Dare say that again…?' I said in a cold, raspy whisper…motioning towards him taking small steps…  'I said how mu-' He attempted to repeat himself but I couldn't take it anymore…  This loser was really pissing me off and I had given him all the possible hints to tell him to back off…what a pig…  I backed away from him escaping from the body heat he was giving off and I drew my arm back and punched him in the face as hard as I could….  'I'm not a whore so why don't you just mind your own f*cking business!!!!!!' I yelled back at him in rage…  Everyone on the street was staring at me now in utter shock and silence…it was completely silent besides the cries of pain from the loser I had punched…  I glared at each and everyone's face with disgust…people only new to assume…just because I was wearing this kind of outfit people thought I was a whore…did I look like a whore? Was I walking like a whore? Did it look like I was practically throwing myself at everyone who was passing by?  My whole body filled up with rage and hatred for the whole world…it felt like it had turned its back on me that I was the only sane one in this stupid society…why did this have to happen to me?  'What are all of you looking at?! Haven't you seen a girl hit a guy before?!! Mind your own F*cking business if you don't want to end up like this loser!!!' I screamed at the top of my lungs shooting an evil glare around me to the people who had formed a circle around me at a distance…  They remained to have blank faces but soon shuffled around and quickly dispersed and scattered back to their own business…  I huffed and puffed trying to catch my breath back…while my eyes remained wide on guard for any sudden movements…After I had regained my senses I decided to go back to the bar and vent out my anger on the loser…as well as collect my last pay check from Crystal Bar…  My platforms clinked on the cold concrete floor as I stomped off in rage…when I reached the bar it was 3:00am already…it was amazing how time passed by so quickly…but that wasn't important to me right now…  Just as I thought…the bar was still lively with the loud DJ music on and the heavy smell of liquor wafting in the air…when I entered nobody seemed to notice me which was good because I was in one of my fits and if anyone shot me a weird stare or look I would literally vent my anger on them…which wouldn't be good because I was intending to let it all out on that prick who got me fired…I think his name was Benjamin Uy or something…his driver's license photo wasn't very attractive…he had a pot-head hair cut…I mean, what kind of a girl would find a pot-head hair cut appealing to her taste…sheesh…  I trudged to the bar and asked for the manager…his name was Brian Joo…he was a pretty decent guy…really hot…I guess he attracted all the female customers…but I was never interested in him…though he might seem like a down to earth guy…how could he be if he owned such a bar which seemed to focus on the bar girls wearing such outfits…  Brian and I were on good terms…but he had once told me that his business came first…and he didn't develop friendships with his employees…I had nodded my head in reply not wishing to question his motives…although I never admitted it I considered him as my only friend…and now that I was fired by him…my only friend at that…you can obviously see why I'm in such an aggravated state of mind right now…  I understand why Brian fired me though…like he said…'business comes first'…  'Hey Nicky…sorry about before…you understand why I did it though right?' Brian's warm voice seeped into my skin and I began to soften up…  'Yeah…I understand…' I said softly turning to the side not wishing to look him in the eyes…somehow Brian always seemed to calm me down and make me feel better…it was like a special bond I shared with him that was never expressed through words…  I took a deep breath in and inhaled the thick smell of liquor before speaking again…  'Look…I'm sorry about before…I didn't mean to cause a scene or anything…I just came for my last pay check and I'll get out of your way…' I said glancing at him and then at the floor…  I could feel Brian's eyes filled with pity and sorrow on me…after a few minutes he disappeared to the back…  I remained still and stared at my feet…I didn't want to face him…I wanted to get away from him as soon as possible…no one had ever seen me cry before and I didn't want him to…  I had shut everybody out of my life…and that was how I wanted to keep it…I didn't want to love anyone…trust anyone…or open up to anyone…this was just the way I was…I guess I pushed everyone away…  From time to time I would wonder…is that why I'm not loved?...is this why I don't have any friends?...I never really knew why…and while I was growing up at the orphanage the nuns would try to encourage me to join in with the other kids…but I never wanted to…I didn't think I belonged…that they would accept me for who I was…that I'd be criticized and ridiculed just for being….just for being…being me….  Just like my parents didn't want me…didn't accept me…they didn't think I belonged…I mean…isn't that the reason why they left me…gave me up for adoption that is?...  Brian soon came back with a small white envelope…he handed it to me…and I extended my hand for him to place it in…  I lowered my head in shame and disgust with myself… 'Thanks…bye Brian…' I said in a soft muffled whisper while turning to leave…  Slowly I walked out of the bar and squinted back the tears that were on the verge of falling from my eyes…a tear escaped my eye and fell on the floor with a plop on the floor…  'Nicky…' Brian's voice came back to my head…  I had never felt so down in my life…I raised my head and took a deep breath…before I turned around I wiped my tears with my free hand…after taking a few sniffs I turned around ready to face Brian…  'Yeah…' I said plastering a happy face on…  'I'll…I'll need the outfit back…' He said in a soft voice…  My heart sank…and I remembered I was still wearing the slutty costume, not to mention make up…  I nodded my head in reply and walked back to the change rooms with my shoulders slumped…Brian new I took the job because money was a problem for me…I guess he felt sorry for me…but there was nothing he could do now…his reputation would be at stake if he took me back…I had to learn to understand this and live with it…  As I disappeared in the shadows to the door…the sensation of feeling Brian's eyes on my back died down and I relaxed a bit more…  After I changed back to my T-shirt and jeans, washed my face getting rid of the make up and brushed my hair…I looked pretty okay…it didn't look like I had been crying which was a good thing…and the only thing on my mind now was getting back at that Benjamin guy…  I walked out of the changing room after hanging up my outfit…well it wouldn't be my outfit anymore I guess…  With a determined face I confronted the outside bar again…  'The outfits on the rack…' I told Brian while I searched for Ben and his bimbo friends…  'It's been fun working with you and I'm going to miss you…take care aiite?' Brian said nodding his head…  I seemed to have cut him off with my head bobbing up and down busily searching for Ben…  My concentration was broken when a hand waved in my face…my expression soon changed to an annoyed one…  'What?!' I snapped at the person not bothering to see who it was…  'Umm…are you okay Nicky…?' Brian's voice sounded in my ears again…  My expression soon turned soft as I turned to face Brian with a sorry face for snapping at him…  'Oh…uh…I'm alright…' I replied not really paying attention…  My expression soon turned to a satisfied one when I spotted the bimbo crew dancing on the dance floor…  I began to make my way towards Ben who was really sweating it out on the floor…I had to admit he had pretty good moves for a complete idiot…I smirked to myself knowing I was going to catch him in complete surprise…  I was a couple metres within totally bashing it out with him until a warm hand held me back on the shoulder…  I turned around to face the person who had interfered with my plans…with an annoyed expression Brian was my interferer…  'Don't do this now Nicky…I know you want revenge…but not here…' Brian said giving me a contempt sigh…  He seemed to have caught up with my evil plan…I gave him a *don't-mess-with-me* look telling him to back off…  'Nicky…don't give me that look…you know perfectly how it's going to end…I know he seems like a totally insensitive prick and your really ticked off with him…but not here Nicky…now isn't the best time…' Brian said understandingly trying to negotiate and reason with me…  My face soon softened under his stare and I gave out a defeated groan…  'Fine fine…I won't now…but soon…believe me soon…' I said informing Brian that he had managed to cool me down for a while…but it wasn't going to last…not for long that is…  With that I walked out of the bar…still determined to show that loser who he was messing with…    CHAPTER 7  [Ben’s P.O.V. I laughed and danced through the whole night…The guys and I had split up, I had no idea where they were by now…I didn’t really care though  I walked out of the bar with Amy (a girl I had met in the bar) in my arm and a beer bottle in the other, we walked in the cold night towards my car, she lightly smacked me on my chest and I chuckled light heartedly at her attempt to hurt me.  As we neared the car her soft giggles died down and her face went blank…noticing her change I glanced towards my car and the blood instantly drained from my face…  It was the feisty girl who tried to pick a fight with me in the bar, she probably wanted revenge…I secretly smirked to myself gathering my sense back, knowing she couldn’t do anything to me…  Her expression was blank and dull…I couldn’t seen to find any signs of anger or annoyance in them…she seemed like a zombie…Amy twitched and wriggled under my arm, I could tell she was uncomfortable under the feisty girl’s stare…I had to admit, I was rather intimidated and felt uneasy as well.  I plastered a brave expression on my face and gave Amy a reassuring squeeze on the shoulder and a flash of my stunning smile, she smiled uneasily and looked towards the girl again…  We began to saunter towards my car, Amy’s heels clicked on the concrete floor steadily as we neared the girl, while we walked she never took her dull, glassy eyes off of me…although I loved the feeling of girls checking me out…somehow I didn’t get the impression that was what she was doing…  Nervously I looked around pretending not to notice her, I couldn’t shake her stare off, or the uneasiness that lingered in the air…Amy fidgeted around awkwardly not liking her stare either…  The feisty girl was leaning on my car door, she seemed laid back but as cold as stone…it was a frightful feeling…  When we were a metre away from each other I stopped and stood there with an unwelcoming expression on my face, she continued to stare at me with glassy, cold eyes…  What was this girl’s problem? I wondered to myself…Is she always like this?...sheeSh..She needs to get a life  We stood there in complete silence, to any stranger we would have seemed like we were having a staring contest…I looked at her menacingly and she shot me an icy cold glare, if this WAS a staring contest I was getting the feeling that she was winning…  The silence was awkward and eerie, I didn’t like the surroundings either…I mean, I don’t mean to sound like a sissy girl but…there was no one around and it was past midnight already…the only people in sight were Amy and the other girl…  Luckily I was half drunk so I wasn’t really in tune...although I knew perfectly what was going on…I regretted not drinking more alcohol…it would have made me feel better and not so high strung…  ‘What do you want?’ I asked her, deciding to break the deathly silence…  She ignored my question and continued to glare at me…boy, this girl had serious issues to deal with…not only was she a lesbian she was also a weirdo…coming to the conclusion, I settled for that she was a ‘Benjamin Uy Fanatic’  Secretly I smirked to myself knowing there were probably a lot more girls like her around... hopefully nicer though...I sighed to myself feeling contempt that one day they would probably get together and form a ‘Benjamin Uy Lovers Club… BULC’…  ***Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts***  ‘AaAaHHHHHHhHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!’ screamed my fan club  I smirked to myself loving the attention…this was WAY to cool to be true…  ‘OMG..I LOVE YOU BENJAMIN UY!!! MARRY ME!!!’  ‘NO..MARRY ME!!!...I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT I WOULD DIE FOR YOU!!!!!!!’  ‘BENJAMIN UY!!! YOU’RE MY HERO!!!’  ‘AAHhHHHhhH!!!...HE WINKED AT ME!!! DID YOU SEE THAT?!’  Screams of joy filled my ears…it was like heaven…I strutted my stuff and flashed my stunning smile to all the surrounding girls and even did a little pose..the crowd went wild and a couple of my fans fainted…  I winked at them all and even saw a large banner hoisted up in the air reading… ‘BENJAMIN UY…OUR LEGEND…’  Again..my motto rang in my mind again...  'I,Benjamin Uy am literally a chick magnet...'  ***End of Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts***  ‘Leave us…’a cold raspy whisper sounded in my ear…waking me up from my pleasant thoughts…  I soon found myself back in reality…as the cold dry air blew in my face I noticed Amy was trembling…I gathered my senses and picked the pieces together… ‘Leave us…’ the voice rang in my head and I assumed that the creepy girl had told Amy to leave…  She looked at me hesitantly looking for an answer…I decided to let her go, although I was extremely pissed off that I wouldn’t be able to have fun tonight I let her go…her facial expression said it all…she didn’t want to stay with me at all, especially if the weirdo was around…by that I’m referring to the feisty bar girl...or should I say ex-bar girl…  I tilted my head to a side as I watched Amy’s retreating figure…she walked briskly away while her heels clicked constantly on the cold floor…her hair blew in the cool breeze…The faint sound of her heels died down eventually and I realized how insecure I felt right now…this girl could be dangerous…  The obvious dangers dawned on me and it didn’t feel so good to be near her right now…especially after the scene at the bar…she must have been full-on pissed off at me…although I looked buff and manly…this girl seemed weird…and I had a bad feeling about her…     CHAPTER 8  [Ben’s P.O.V.] So there I was... all alone with the crazy stalker…and trust me…it wasn’t a nice feeling…  For some reason I felt like one of those spinefex balls would blow past like how they do in corny, old cowboy movies…  UrgH! What are you talking about Benjamin Uy?!...Your thinking like an idiot now…you have a serious situation here…this is your first encounter with a crazed BULC girl!!! Think of a plan you sexy thing!  I wanted to slap myself on the face for being so stupid…you might think I’d slap myself because I got the girl fired and now she was mega pissed off…but…no…I wouldn’t slap myself for that…never…it was her fault anyway, I have no feelings of guilt at all towards her…besides, she’s not worth ruining my face for…  Well as I was saying…I’d slap myself for not thinking of an emergency route just incase I encounter fans…I mean, if it’s one fan this time then what about next time…2? 14? 20?!…  Urgh! Benjamin Uy why do you have to be so slow sometimes I thought I had everything covered…the looks, the fashion statement…the charm…but I forgot the escape route just incase I encounter a Benjamin crazed fan...  ‘What do you want?’ I spat.  My voice was full of menace and arrogance…I didn’t mean to sound that way…I guess I was panicking…  Then I thought to myself…if this was one of my crazed fans then I would have to make a good impression…she could tell my other fans that I was rude and not all that…o.0…I guess that’s how it has to go when you’re the sexiest man alive…*sigh*  ‘Revenge’ she muttered  ‘Uh-hUh…and how are you going to do that?...you’re not like any fan I’ve seen before…instead of revenge I thought you would be worshipping the ground that I walked on, and besides me getting you fired…if I was you, I’d be thankful that I took notice in you…’ I replied back nonchalantly…while sneering…  I was beginning to feel at ease and I loosened my muscles while crossing my arms in a pose I had practiced many times in the mirror before…I called it my ‘cool pose’  Before she could open her mouth to say something I cut her off and started again…this time letting it all out…  ‘And I’ve never seen a fan stoop so low…honestly, if you wanted something that I possessed why not go to eBay auction?...no need to steal…you don’t even act like a fan…the only thing that makes you my fan is that you’ve probably been fantasizing about me and stalking me for god knows how long…’ I snickered to myself knowing I had got her there…  Any second now she was going to let it all out…and show me pictures she had taken of me going to my house, going to the shops…practically anywhere you could…imagine…maybe even an old Mc Donald’s foam cup that I had drunken from…who knows what extremes my fans would go to…  I turned my head to face her because I had been leaning on my car the whole time…  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  ‘AwWw...SH*T!!!’ I cried out in pain…  Did that just happen?!...I thought to myself…did she just punch me? But I didn’t have to answer that, the pain near my eye was enough…and sheesh...aren’t girls meant to slap…not punch…what a tomboy   When I had gathered back my senses, I straightened my figure and stared at her while snarling…she was really pissing me off…what was with this girl anyway?!  ‘What the Heck was that for?!’ I spat out.  Now it was her time to sneer at me…daMmit…I covered my hurt eye hoping I wouldn’t have a black eye later on...but the chances were pretty high…this girl could do some serious damage!...she had a lot of strength for a girl…  ‘Was that your revenge?!’ I scowled at her.   She had the biggest smirk on her face…that pissed me of even more…If she wasn’t a girl I would’ve hit her…but then again…she could have been a guy cause she had a lot of strength…and she acted like a guy to…not to mention I thought she was a lesbian, so she could’ve been straight, just that she was a drag queen…  I thought to myself for a moment with a blank expression plastered on my face…then I inspected her smirking face...she had large hazel eyes, a petite nose and small cherry lips…all her features seemed to scream out ‘perfection’ and ‘femininity’…  I shook my head vigorously coming to the conclusion that she wasn’t a drag queen because she had the figure of a girl too…*sigh*…I settled with the conclusion that she was a tomboy…and again, a ‘lesbian’…obviously because she had punched me…and if my other fans were here...they’d want to get a piece of her…  I could picture them right now…  *Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts*  ***[Rewind]***  *** [Play] ***  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  ‘AwWw...SH*T!!!’ I cried out in pain…  *screams* ‘Ben…are you okay?!’   I’d soon be bombarded with my fans…  ‘You’re beautiful face, Oppa…are you okay…’ another fan would be close to tears  Others looked like they had been punched…that’s how much my fans loved me…*sigh*…they felt my pain so much that it hurt them…  A couple of my other fans fainted from the shock…poor girls...I guess it was too much for them…  All of a sudden my fans got up…one by one…leaving a few of them still comforting me and smothering me with affection…  ‘You’ll pay for that you B*tch!’ one of them would say  ‘YeaH…we’re going to teach you not to mess with Ben….who the heck do you think you are anyway…to ruin his sexy face…you’re going down!!!’ another determined fan would yell out  The rest of them chorused in with a … ‘yEah!’  All of a sudden they were all screaming and charging towards the weirdo fan…*sigh*…where would I be without my fan club...  *End of Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts*  I was taken back to reality when the ex-bar girl, ex-lesbian and ex-drag queen spoke…wow she was a lot of ‘ex’s’  ‘No…that was just for making up a lot of sh*t’ she snarled in a matter-a-fact tone which pissed me off even more…  Urgh! I can’t stand her!  ‘Get in the car’ she said, her voice seemed to be calming down…she seemed more feminine now…  I did as she said thinking that she was going to let me go now…*phew*…this was enough for one day…as soon as I get home I’m taking a long shower…  I clicked the alarm and got in my car…while I put on my seatbelt the weird girl opened the passenger door right next to the driver’s seat…  What the hell?!...she’s not getting in with me! I’m not that crazy…she’ll probably bash me to a pulp…  She got in the car…and I glared at her mouth-open and eyes wide…what the heck did she want now?!     CHAPTER 9  [Ben’s P.O.V.] Again…I thought to fast and I thought I was allowed to go…but here I am again…in a car with some psycho…  ‘Now what is it?!’ I scowled at her while frowning…  Again, she wore the same annoying smirk on her face…I could tell that she had the upper hand already…obviously she wasn’t going to leave me alone unless she got what she wanted…*sigh*…she was lucky that I wasn’t the abusive type of guy if you know what I mean..  ‘You got me fired’ she said in an accusing voice  ‘You stole from me’ I said mimicking her tone  ‘I’m going to be homeless now because of you’ she said accusing me in a louder voice…  I paused for a few moments taking it all in…homeless? Is that why she stole? Is that why she’s a bar girl?  It dawned on me why she did all those things…and how she was so pissed off at me…bar girls earn quite a lot of money nowadays…and I got her fired…I was beginning to feel sorry for her…*sigh*……she probably needed the money...  But I wasn’t going to let her know I felt sorry for her...I’d probably get another black eye……it was so unfair though…because she was a girl I wasn’t allowed to hit her…and that pissed me off…  ‘You stole my cell phone’ I accused her in a challenging way while leaning closer to her…  ‘Because of you I lost my only friend’ she said again in aggravation…she leaned closer challenging me back  Retreating my head a few centimeters…I thought of a comeback…HmmS…  ‘You stole my wallet!’ I accused in a loud voice…  ‘There was only 5 bucks in there anyway you cheap prick!’ she yelled at me trying to defend her actions…  I was taken aback by her words but I managed to find a come back pretty easily…  ‘I don’t like carrying around a lot of money okay?! And 5 bucks is probably a lot more then you have!’ I spat back  As soon as I had finished my sentence…her face softened and I immediately wished that I hadn’t said that…maybe I was too cruel and harsh…  Before I could apologize I got another…-  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  Whelps…I guess you know what happened huh? Yups you’re right…another black eye *sigh* but this time I deserved it…   ‘ARgh!!! F*ck!’ I cried out in agony again…  DaMn…this loony wasn’t going to get an apology from me...never, not after my 2nd black eye…  ‘So what the heck do you want now?!’ I grimaced at her…hoping to change the subject…  ‘Like I said…revenge…’she sneered at me…  ‘Yeah…I’m not stupid you know…you don’t have to repeat yourself…’ I retorted.  ‘What do you want then?’ I asked her giving up the fight trying to get it over and done with while covering my ‘2nd’ black eye...  She snickered at me…urgh! I can’t stand her…she pisses me off so much...  ‘I’ll be staying with you for a hundred days…either that or you give me $100,000…your choice’ she said seeming as though she had thought about it for a while…  My mouth gaped open not wishing I had heard correctly…  ‘W-w-what?’ I managed to choke out while stuttering…  Her eyes met mine and she stared at me for a few moments before wearing a big grin from ear to ear…  ‘I thought you said you weren’t stupid’ she questioned me…  My face had a blank and confused expression on…what was she talking about…  ‘I’m not stupid’ I retorted back in a matter-a-fact tone  ‘Didn’t you say I didn’t have to repeat myself because you weren’t stupid?’ she asked me already knowing the answer…  ‘Yeah…so?’ I replied her curious to what she was getting at…  ‘Well you wanted me to repeat myself just then’ she said flatly  I paused for a short while taking it all in…she was right...I did…I wanted to strangle her right now…dammit...She was so annoying and I hated the fact that she was right…  ‘aRgH!...whatever’ I retorted, while crossing my arms like a little boy and facing the other way not wishing to look at her…  ‘Well…what’s your choice?’ she asked me while slouching on my car seat…  ‘What makes you think that I’m going to do what you say?!’ I snapped  ‘Well…besides the fact that you stripped me from my only friend, got me fired, and soon I’m going to be homeless all because of you…I also have your personal belongings…e.g. your cell phone and driver’s license…unless you want people to see Benjamin Uy the man with the afro…then I suggest you agree to my conditions’ she replied with a big grin plastered on her face.  My eyes grew wide with shock…  ‘This is blackmail!’ I accused her in disgust.  ‘Don’t you think I already know this?’ she sneered at me not expecting an answer…  I thought for a while and spoke again…  ‘You know…your offer is ‘extremely tempting’ but I think turning you in as a thief to the police seems more satisfying’ I retorted sarcastically.  I waited to see what she would say…it didn’t really matter though…because this time I had the upper hand…HuahahAHa…and it felt good too…  ‘Are you threatening me?’ she said in a low whisper while slowly leaning closer to my face…  She was so close that I could feel her hot breath on me…  ‘So what if I am? You started it by trying to blackmail me’ I snarled in disgust while leaning in close…we were so close that our noses were millimeters away from touching…  She paused for a while and gazed into my eyes…then she pulled away and leaned on the car door while facing me inside the car…  She grinned at me and all the while never took her eyes off of me…what was this weirdo up to now?...  ‘What?’ I asked her demandingly   ‘Oh…it’s nothing…it’s just that I thought you wouldn’t want your drivers license to be enlarged and stuck around the city so everybody could see that humungous, embarrassing afro that you had…and I thought you would want your cell phone back…that’s all…nothing much…’ she said casually…  With that she turned her body around and opened the car door motioning that she was leaving…  I was flabbergasted by her words…but as soon as it sank in...I knew my reputation as being the sexiest man alive would be ruined if she wasn’t bluffing...I mean…what would happen to BULC?!...  *Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts* ‘WE LOVE YOU BENJAMIN UY!!!’  ‘MARRY ME BENJAMIN UY!!!’  ‘YOU’RE MY HERO!!!’ *faints*  ‘BEN…I THINK YOU’RE THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE!!!’  My fans surrounded me with banners and presents…I don’t like to boast or anything but a couple of the banners read…  ‘BENJAMIN UY…GOD’S GIFT TO WOMEN!’  ‘BENJAMIN UY…OUR LEGEND’  ‘SEXY=BENJAMIN UY’  ‘I LOVE YOU BEN…PLEASE BE MINE’  I chuckled light heartedly…to them, I was God’s gift…*sigh*…so perfect…  [Next Day]  Flyer papers were stapled and stuck up anywhere you could imagine…ranging from pink, blue, yellow, white, green and red…  ARgh! My driver’s license…and that hideous picture of me!!!..  ‘Hey…that’s Benjamin Uy…the guy on those papers…how embarrassing…I feel sorry for him’ I heard a girl say…  ‘Isn’t that Benjamin Uy...the guy with the afro?’ another pointed at me and laughed…  ‘Wow…he sure has changed…and to think I used to like a guy who had an afro!’ one of my former fans chuckled…  ‘NoOoOOooOOoooOooO!!!!!!!!!!’  *End of Ben’s Dreamy Thoughts*  ‘WAIT!!!’ I shouted back to the weird girl’s retreating figure…  I wasn’t going to let her ruin my reputation...never...how embarrassing…I shook my head vigorously trying to brush the image out of my mind…what a frightful image…  She turned around and sneered…it was like she already knew I was going to agree to her conditions…that pissed me off as well…how she was always right...and she got her way all the time..…urgh!     CHAPTER 10  [Ben’s P.O.V.] ‘So what’s your choice?’ she snapped again…  I thought for a while…and obviously I didn’t have $100,00…I mean...who would have that amount of money...besides some rich person...and obviously I’m not the richest person in the world…I don’t like to part with my money either…I’m cheap okay?..  ‘100 days…’ I muttered obviously not happy that she had won…  She smirked at me satisfied that she had succeeded in getting what she wanted…again…she got in my car and shut the door behind her…  ‘After the 100 days…I want everything you stole from me back okay?’ I snapped at her demandingly…  ‘Yeah...whatever’ she muttered back while putting her seatbelt on…  I started the engine up in my car…  ‘Why do you want to stay with me anyway? I can understand you’re one of my ‘many’ fans and all…but you sure don’t act like one…you act like you despise me’ I retorted…making sure I emphasized the word ‘many’ deliberately in an attempt to piss her off and tell her that she wasn’t that great herself…  I sat there waiting for her to answer my question…it was quiet for a while…the engine was still running and that was about the only thing that you could hear…  ‘Three strikes bimbo!’ she hollered  *!!!Ka-PoW!!!*  ‘ArgH!!! Damn you…you’re really pissing me off you know?!’ I scowled at her while clutching my eye… (The one she had punched first)  The pain from the first punch was already bad enough...and she just had to punch me again…on the same eye too…oh no…wait…which ever eye she punched it would be the ‘same’ eye anyway…because she had already punched both of my eyes…  ‘So what the heck was that punch for?!’ I asked her extremely annoyed…  ‘Simple…I hate repeating myself…the answer was ‘revenge’…at the start I told you I wanted revenge…then you asked me again what I wanted after I punched you the 2nd time…I told you again that I wanted revenge…then you told me you weren’t stupid and that I didn’t have to repeat myself…and here I am again…you want me to repeat myself…’ she snapped at me  I thought back to the previous events…again…she was right…*sigh*…that would have been three times…  ‘Well…now you know that I don’t like to repeat myself three times in a row okay?...if I do repeat myself again then you’re going to get another punch for being an idiot…got it?’ she said demandingly  ‘Whatever’ I muttered under my breath…  I started up the engine again and I drove her to her old apartment to grab her stuff…then we drove to my apartment…  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TO BE CONTINUED~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
