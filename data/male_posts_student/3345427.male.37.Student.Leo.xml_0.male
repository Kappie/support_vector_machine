Months and Months of darkness and cold. Moving to an area that experiences the 4 seasons of Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall was one of the best things I have ever done. You see in Miami the only two seasons you get is WET and Wetter.   So I mused this evening as I sat with my hubby eating Chinese food in the Food Court below the Paramount theatre before seeing VanHelsing.   When I moved here in April of 2002, there was snow on the ground. And for the first time since I was a small boy, I experienced a real seasonal change. That would be the last "Snow event" for the 2001-2002 Winter season. So I moved into Summer with all its heat and humidity like Florida. When Wintter came again, in 2002 I had been dating my boyfriend Peter for a couple of months. One night I was on my way back to my apartment it was a night unlike any other night. As I walked down Verdun Avenue to my apartment it started snowing. It was just me the falling snow and the silence. I had come to respect and admire the silence for she had a way of her own. She is soft and hard in the same breath. She is calm and quiet in one breath and crazy and loud in the next. But in the end when Winter comes she brings a hush to every day life. Everything gets muted and everything gets quiet.   When you walk down the street after a good snow fall all you hear is silence. When the Winter comes you lock down the Windows and everything inside your home gets quiet. The world gets shut out of the days and nights, silence comes and I love that silence. It took some time to get used to the silence. Not many people can be at peace and comfortable in their silence. I for one learned how. Silence is that place I can go at any time, like strolling through the halls of a monastery at OCA during a silent retreat, or the silence that greets you at the door of most Cathedrals and churches here in Montreal. I love the silence. I love to walk with her, when she greets us each Winter. And I am sad when she leaves.   For now the world has awoken, Montreal is out in force. Cabin fever came on strong this past Winter. She was brutal, dark and long. She haunted and teased us for months with the never knowing if she would drop another foot of snow on us at any given time. Most people here say I wil loutgrow this the longer I live here, but we will see.   When we bid goodbye to her this April, the city of Montreal starting coming out of their stupors, out of their self imposed hibernation. We took the plastic off the windows and for the first time we breathed in fresh air from the outside. The first night we slept with the windows open, I had a hard time with all the NOISE!!! God it was so noisy outside. i wish it were quieter in here, I can't sleep with all that noise. For God sakes will all you drunks, whores and night owls go to bed already!!! That's what you get for living on Cabot Square in Downtown Montreal.   The SILENCE was gone. And I mourned her leaving for about a week. I am used to the noise again, for it will be with us until She returns to us and once again. When the Winter comes again, I will celebrate her and her silnce that she brings.   For now, My Ode to Silence goes on every day. i have to seek the silence whereever I might be able to. Like in the space of a church, or in the whispering of the trees up on the Mountain or out in the mountains where the only noise you hear is the voice of silence blowing through the trees on a windy day.   Life goes on, do you take the silence for granted, or do you know her? Now with the noise of the world in full force, you cannot hear her can you? You must seek the silence in between all the noise of life, lest you go crazy in the business of the day.   Good night from Montreal.  Jeremy
