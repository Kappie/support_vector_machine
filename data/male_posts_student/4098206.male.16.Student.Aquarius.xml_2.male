Things really kicked off when Dave. C established territories on the purple sector (park lane and mayfair). I would have done that myself but i had spent most of my time languishing in jail. From that point onward, the Anti-Dave alliance was formed, in an attempt to break his grip. Alas, it was all in vain. Dave.J fell to 'tother Daves schemes and a vital member of the alliance was lost. During this time, Richard (the evil capitalist pig that he is :)) was establishing his 'corner of death' (he was building up the orange and red sectors). My complete dominance over the blue area could not save me from his evil plots. I too fell. By the time Richard was seen as a true threat to all on the board, it was too late. Dave was annihilated. It was only Jon and Richard. Brave Jon put up a considerable fight, but ultimately, he too fell. Richard is now the uncontested ruler of my monopoly board :(.  'No matter' i says to myself. I introduced Richard to the CnC Generals, and he was hypnotised long enough for me to pack away the board and hide it ^^. The excitement of Monopoly now gone, we all turn our heads to a thoroughly exhilerating pastime of all our crew... beating the odd smelling and much loathed Paul Leonard at games he claims he 'pwns' all on. The foolish Paul attempted to break our extremely potent Gattling defenses with,of all things, technicals (pick-up trucks with lame-arse machine guns on top). They were ripped apart. As we closed in on him, he disconnected saying he was 'kicked out of the game' (yea right...).  After Richard finished ridiculing paul with my headphone/microphone set (a device he is enthralled by), we got to work on my Gamecube. Smash bros. was first on the menu. Dave., the techno throwback of the crew (56k, Playstation etc.) and thus not knowing the names of some the characters involved, announced that his character would be Seamus.(You know! Seamus Aran, hero of Leprechaun Prime etc.¬_¬) He meant Samus, but that didn't stop Jon losing himself in the world of laughter, bringing myself and Dave.J with him. Dave.C then decided to use Browser (the Tortoise/Dragon crossbreed who fights with Mario the Administrator ¬_¬). This was actually Bowser, and once again, we were laughing.  Eventually the fight was underway. Dave.J was Capt. Falcon, Jon was Ganondorf, Dave.C was Roy and i was Donkey Kony. By luck i picked up a Super Mushroom and, consequently, D.K grew in size. At this, i couldn't help but say, 'Now he's Horse Kong.' (Cos a horse is bigger than a donkey, is it not?) Laughter once again ensued, ensuring that Smash bros.     remains a group favourite.  Other games were played. They were: F-Zero, Mario Kart and Clone Wars. All were fun and all kept us inside, which was good, since it was rather wet and stormy out.  All in all, Baz has had a good tuesday 3rd of August 2004, and hopes that similar arrangements will be just as good.
