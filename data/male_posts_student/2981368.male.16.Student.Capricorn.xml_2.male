And somehow, I managed to only get Tasks A, C and F done. Some is done already...but argh. Very tiring, boring and generally crap. Though I have got double PE to look forward to (Tuesday). That should be fun. Apart from that the extra half hour I gain from it will be spent listening to Holly go completely crazy, then spend ages doing...*gasp* more coursework. Whoopee doo. What incredible fun.   Oh, one good thing from todays coursework blast: I had to make a flyer/poster of some kind, and what I made I'm kinda proud of...and might have to sell it or something. Eehee. http://botprojectx.topcities.com/taskc4.gif
