Its almost like she dumped me...cuz I have never been so miserable in my life since the day I asked Jadie out and she said "sure". Im going completely nuts without her. There is nobody to walk to class with. Nobody's house to go to after football. Nobody to make me do my math homework. Nobody to annoy with stupid jokes. Man...am I a sad-sack or what???
