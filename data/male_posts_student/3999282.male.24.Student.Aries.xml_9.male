But oh well, I've got over with it and start to have my own life.     I opened my personal account yesterday. Can you imagine that? Open my first account when I am 24? my god, what kind of person I am? Anyway, I will also talk to a financial advisor at TD trust for investment regarding mutual funds and stocks. Wish me luck.    I will try to keep posting if I still remember ^_^
