(Musical theme ends)    (Serious note)  Take solace in a song of truth.  Yesteryear gave way to tomorrow.  Where sugarplums once reigned,  Now dances incoherence and sorrow.    But feeling has no buoyancy  Under waves of tuning out,  For pleasure is nothing,  And stimulation is in drought.    We follow no paths  Since ebbing tides smooth the trail.  Simplicity and solidity  Leave the taste buds dry and stale.  (Serious note ends)    (Ponderous thought)  What happened to Yesterday...?  (Keep pondering)
