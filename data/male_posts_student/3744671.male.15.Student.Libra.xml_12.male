Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately I haven't read the stories which this film is based off of, so I can't really compare it to anything, and don't know what I'm missing in the stories.   I thought the actors did a great job in this, I thought the effects were great, the robots looked pretty darn cool. I also thought they did a pretty decent job with the music and sound effects in this film.   So far, this is my second favourite film of the summer, and also the year, behind Spider-Man 2! You will proably appreciate this film and enjoy it more if you're a science-fiction fan like myself, or you might not if you've grown up reading the short stories and are attached to them, but never the less I still love it. I might be scoring this a little generous because I do like science-fiction stuff more than any other genre of films, but it is deserving in my mind.     Rating:  4.5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
