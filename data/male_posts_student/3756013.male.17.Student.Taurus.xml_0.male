My dad introduced me to all the people he works with and I heard a lot of stories about my dad and what my dad tells them about me. lol It was rather interesting. Then jokingly I asked my dad to get me a glass of wine, well I didn't think he would, but to my surprise when he came back he had the big glass of wine...Well, as the reception went on these waiter guys kept coming around to fill up the glass...I really didn't notice them doing it, they just sorta did it when I wasn't looking. Well after 3 big glasses of wine and 2 glasses of champain...I got a little tipsy...My dad and his work buddies were laughing at me because I was stumbling around and had trouble keeping my head up...and yeah...Now the whole point of me being there was to talk to a recruiter from Westpoint. Well...when I talked to him it didn't work out to well. I couldn't concentrate on what he was saying...Instead of concentrating on what he was saying...I was concentrating on standing...lol it was great...I'm sure I made such a good impression on him lol...Well, when I got home I had no trouble sleeping...I KNOCKED OUT!!! We got home at 5 and I woke up at 11 only because my damn cell phone was ringing off the wall...O well, still had a good nap, I know if my cell didn't ring I could have slept until tomorrow morning...o well...tomorrow should be fun, we got a swim party for church and Juan might go. O well, I'm gonna go...Catch yall later!
