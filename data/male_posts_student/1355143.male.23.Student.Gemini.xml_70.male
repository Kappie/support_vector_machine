Ok there is this guy whos been a hit here and came to throw a concert in downtown Reykjav√≠k, I did miss it specially coz I didnt have a clue who he was but I heard great things about him and so I got myself his album. Ok his name is Damien Rice and he's kind of like David Gray but yet different, he has great lyrics and is often just his wonderful Irish (smile Tim) voice and a guitar. He also has this female singer with him and some songs are very much produced (not in a negative way). So y'all should get this album coz you'll love it (ok maybe not Constance but even Seema might:D). I have a feeling though that you've all heard of this fella and specially my beloved Tim.
