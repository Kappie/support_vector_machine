So, last night I stayed up until like 5AM working on masks until I decided that it's better to collapse onto my bed than to fall over and drool on the palmrests of my TiBook. Anyway, I woke up at like 8 and damn, was I tired. I finished up the last few slices of the one I was working on last night and completely did the other one in 2.5 hours. I left for work at 12:30 and got there at like 13:15 and did what work I could until I got stuck and talked to Rebecca. She said that she wouldn't answer my questions anymore and that I should save them all up for question sessions once a week, which to me seems kinda stupid, but whatever. She's the boss, so I guess I have to follow her rules. Anyway, I got there and only had like an hour or two worth of work, TOPS before I got stuck on the pipeline, so I just left at like 15:00 or so because I saw no point in working on nothing and called Babak asking him what was up with the Younai situation. He said we meet her tomorrow and that he was at Sharzahd (I think I spelled that wrong, but whatever) which is on Westwood Blvd. just down the road of the Westwood Village, if I wanted to meet up with him. I did, so I walked down and met up with him, his fiancÃ© and her brother, who happens to share my first name. It can get irritating especially because they speak farsi all the time and I can never figure out what they're saying or whether they're calling me or him. Whatever, some more, I guess. After lunch, we headed over to a little persian bookstore, looked around a bit, then went to Borders and looked around a bit more, didn't buy anything though. Then we headed over to this field to play some soccer with some people Babak knows, but we had to stop off at his house first because Amir didn't have shoes or proper clothing or anything. After we got Amir dressed, we headed over to the field and played a bit. It was an ok, leaning towards bad game. I mean, the people in Boston are just so much better when it comes to pick-up soccer. I'm probably just being reminiscent though and looking at the situation through a warped lens. After an hour, if that, of soccer, we went to Jamba Juice and got some smoothies and all was good. We then went to Babak's house and hung out for a while until we had to go get Babak's car, which was still at Sharzahd. And finally, after this long and exciting day, Amir and his sister (I really don't wanna mess up the spelling of her name >_  I haven't been feeling very good today, or the past few days, really. I don't know why. I think I feel kind of like Boston is so much farther away than it was before and that really hurts. I mean, I helped the new tenants of the place that I lived for five years move in. Thinking back, that was really kind of disturbing. I miss the days when the family was united and at least felt like a unit. I don't think it will ever have that same level of unity again, despite my dad's moving out here. Something fundamental about this family got FUCKED when my mom and sister left for this hellhole in the first place. I don't hate them or anything for it, but I kind of resent it in a way. In any event, I also realized I've been having this very odd feeling for the past few days. I feel both loved and lonely at the same time. It's horrible because I feel lonely and therefore sad, but I feel like it's not legitimate or grounded in anything real so I end up hating myself. I really don't like things now, but I guess I should hope for the best and have a positive outlook because, as has always been my philosophy, if you have a negative outlook, you'll never see the good in anything. I guess I should stop whining because I have it pretty good. I also feel kind of anxious. I don't want to prep for the SATs again and I don't want to study math and I don't want to do anything but sleep, play guitar, and talk to people. What in god's name was I meant to do? I mean, jeez, I'm technically a fucking Genius, or at least close (163 IQ; test taken at third grade) and I have no direction or drive or anything. WHY IS GOD DOING THIS TO ME?! FUCK!...  Fuck is right. God, send me a message or something because this really sucks.  Looking back on this post, it doesn't make much sense, it's unorganized, and lacks... ness. Whatever. I'm too tired and busy self-loathing to care.  I miss christina :-(.  That is all. -- Feanor
