Taking a high schooler over a proven collegiate athlete just boggles my mind but oh well its not like i'm an nba GM or anything.  Ok enough of that bs.   Today should be a fun filled day.  wake up at 1, post a blog, shower, pay bills and go to work until 11 woohoo i can hardly wait.  Everyone else out there have fun today..I know i won't :)
