The reason for this is that I have fallen in, as is my tendency, with others who share my no-fun stance on beverages.  This would not be so much of a problem, except that one of them is banned for life from the one bar any of us would consider frequenting, ironically for attempting to sneak in an underaged patron who is herself straight-edge.  The result of this is that my weekend nights, rather than involving any kind of social activity, tend to revolve around  Law  Order  reruns.  Not to dis  Law  Order , of course.  Jerry Orbach is, in my opinion, one of the finest actors working today and were I a  urlLink Chicago resident , I would have voted for him at least two more times than I did already.  It's just that there's only so much interest to be squeezed out of the tube.  Plus, I think that  SVU  is starting to warp my mind.  So tonight I decided to make the rounds of the various locals.  Because bar time here is 3 AM, it was no difficulty to observe all of the main watering holes in full swing between 11 PM and 1 AM.  By now you've probably realized you're in for another "Bloomington sucks and here's how" post, and here's how this one is going to work:  I've realized that Bloomington's main problem is that it is square as fuck.  It is so square that were my mother to visit, she would doubtless qualify as one of the Top Ten Most "Metal" Individuals Ever In Bloomington.  In an effort to quantify how square it is, I am going to give a rundown of Bloomington's most popular bars and the most analogous Madison bar, since the core readership of this blog (Hi, Core Readership!) is most familiar with those bars.  Ahem.    urlLink  Nick's English Hut   - Brothers.    urlLink  Kilroy's   - Stillwaters.    urlLink  Kilroy's Sports   - Madhatters.    urlLink  Club Axis   - that one shitty meatmarket club under the Church Key.    urlLink  the Irish Lion   - Monday's, but with food.    urlLink  Scotty's   - the Angelic without the reggae.    urlLink  The Bluebird   - the Angelic without the food.    urlLink  the Vertigo   - the Annex.    urlLink  Rhino's   - the New Loft.    the Upstairs Pub  - Bullfeather's, but inside the Church Key.    urlLink  Bullwinkle's   - midway between the Rainbow Room and the Cardinal.    urlLink  the Second Story   - probably the only truly unique place in Bloomington, but not in a particularly positive way.  Seems to compare closely with what I've heard about Merlin's.   And now we come to the centerpiece of my claim,  urlLink  the Video Saloon  , aka "The Vid".  Based on earlier descriptions I have until recently persisted in thinking of the Video Saloon as Bloomington's answer to the Paradise.  Today, though, it struck me that this was extremely inaccurate.  The Paradise has way more heshers and a better jukebox.  The Vid has way more bar games and a larger contingent of slumming Greeks.  Oh fuck living here has compelled me to use the expression "Greek" to describe fratboys.  Therefore, the more accurate analogy would be with the Plaza.  You will note above therefore a total absence of any analogue or even near-analogue to the Madison bars that make life bearable.  There is no 'Dise, no Genna's, and no Mickey's.  No Nick's or Paul's or Stage Door. There is not even a god damned Silver Dollar or a Lava Lounge.  The only nighttime activities in this town involve shotglasses and quarters.
