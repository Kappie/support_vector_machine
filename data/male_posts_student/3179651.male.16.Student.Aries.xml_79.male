Let's just hope she doesn't go out on a whim and ram the navigator into the side of the statue of liberty or something of the like. I need to work on my graduation speech; I at least need to think of a title by tomorrow. How does "Aiming Higher Every Day" sound? or "Having the Absolut Best Time in High School" Or how about "Putting a Little Perc Into Every Day" Hmmmmm....any suggestions?
