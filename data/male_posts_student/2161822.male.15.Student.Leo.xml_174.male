The good ol' days. I really don't remember much about pre-school. My teacher's name was Wendy I believe. After seeing that picture of my class, I don't even remember half of those kids in my class. I looked like a retard. Just smaller. Ratman still looked like a rat. Just smaller. And he's makin a cool face in the picture. Joseph looks the same. If that is Zach Smith then he seems to still not know what's going on. But we love Zach. He's awesome. Lindsay still looks the same just smaller in that pic. Sarah looks the same, but with shorter hair. I think. Yeah. Let's see who else is here. Vanessa Kaschak, Bianca Roman, Alicia Uliano, Veronica Nelson. Ward. Wasn't too wide back in the day. That's surprising. Lol just kidding Chris. And last but not least Skulldoggg. Still looks the same, just without the mop on his head. So basically, not alot of us changed too much. Maybe we got slightly more immature, but hey.    urlLink Here is the link to the picture. Sarah's site.  Go to main content and scroll down. See P-Rod in cool highwaters.
