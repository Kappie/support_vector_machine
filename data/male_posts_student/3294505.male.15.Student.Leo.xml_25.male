I still have the problems on my mind that are making me upset; problems that lots of people would ask me what they were and just would laugh at their opinion of said issue's "silly"-ness. All the same, despite my unresolved issues which I refuse to elaborate on so publicly, I feel a little better. The escape from my troubles, if only for a weekend, enhanced my mood on a monolithic scale, if only temporarily. I'll be able to tackle my challenges with a little more ease, knowing I took a break from worrying about them (mostly).   Anyways, back to the daily summer grind of preoccupying myself with not only these issues, but to tackle on more useless distractions such as message boards and roleplaying. Yes, roleplaying. Hopefully things look up, despite my pessimistic disposition.
