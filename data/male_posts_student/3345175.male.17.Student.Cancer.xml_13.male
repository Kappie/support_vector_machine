Higher Biology was scarily easy, which means either the SQA wer lettin their standards drop (standards which are too ridiculously high and irrelevant in the first place) or it means that i have completely bombed the whole fuckin thing.  YAY fun!  Maths tomorrow, which i have no clue wot im doing in. I wont lie: i havent studied as much as i couldve. I have confidence in my skills. I have confidence in myself. And i am completely confident that tomorrow i will go in there, sit down, get out my pen and calculator, and be torn limb from limb by that bloody paper.  YAY more fun!  Not that it interests anyone, but i got my first letter from my pal Maz today since...well...since ever. We met last summer at Scottish Youth Theatre, spent the whole five weeks as best mates and then only saw each other once since. I've already written my reply. Hers wasnt the only male i got this morning. Four envelopes. Four! My mum is one of a very cloe-knit family of seven. We are all very close with our aunts and cousins etc. And i can honestly say i dont even get four envelopes in one day when its my birthday!  Number One was Maz's letter (YAY!)  Number Two was a letter from SYT concerning this project i was supposed to be working on with them, being playwrighting assistant for a couple of weeks till they get it completed.  Number Three was a letter from the council's education board telling me they couldnt financially support me for SYT.  And number four was a letter from the council's education board...giving me an application form so they could financially support me for SYT. Bizarre, non?  And OMG tonight was the second last ever episode of Friends. I've known the whole story of the final arc for months (i'm sneaky when it comes to lookin up spoiler sites, then casually droppin stuff into conversations with massive fanatics. heehee im evil.) I was nearly cryin', but thanks to Chandler's nice addition of fart jokes i managed not to.   Emz and I are good again, Arlene WAS over David until about twenty minutes ago ('twas her 17th b-day today. Happy boyfday sweetie-pie, havent spoken to Claire since yesterday and Danny is all like blondily highlighted now, which is kool (and really not helpful in the fight to prove his heterosexuality).    Ryan is being a teensy bit weirder than usual (which, ya know, who cares?!), Daniel is going away to Gay Paris next week without me (the sexy beast!), and Maz is comin down to seeee meeeee!!! YAY! Everythins goin good!    And now its not. Coz i just remembered...  Ahhh maths! Bloody maths! All trigonometry and differentiation and pencils! Dems evil, dem pencils.    DAMN YOU PENCILS!   DAMN YOOOOOOUUUUUU!!!!!
