This is only because I don't have the time at present to really get etaoinshrdlu.net cooking; it sucks, because this is a domain I've wanted for years (I'd rather .com than .net, but whatever), but is there really a reason to pay $12/mo when I get a site for free?  There might be, because UT has such strict FTP and cgi-bin access that I spent two hours today trying to set the blog up over there, to no avail.  Also, I might have signed a 1 year contract for etaoinshrdlu.net, so I might be stuck here.  And it's not bad; I just want the site to be so much, and while it's not, why pay for a full-out domain?
