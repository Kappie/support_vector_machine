I got all worked up on an essay about my feelings about Religions and the human soul that it was basically a rant about how jealous I am of people of faith. Same old. Walked around with Kyle, Steve, Mike and Andrew for a few hours, ate pizza and here I am. At home. Im supposed to go to a job interview at a burger place tonight. I guess it's about time I decided to upgrade the amount of money I take in a month from zero to something in the hundred area. Should be cool. I have a math exam tommorow and I am gonna fail. No fucking hope.Aw well.... should study......bleh.
