I have to contact my local Rotary club to see if they sponsor scholarships and what not. I definetly wouldn't be able to do this without a scholarship. I would love to go to France for a month or 2. Or Italy.   Well, tomorrow, I will hopefully have some photos from the FayCo Fair. Kel and I working tomorrow morning. I will also be working on Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon, and Monday night. I'm sure I'll be working some more nights next week; I'll post the schedule later.   Let's see, this friday...Fair, SB2W staff training, then the CBYF is going to see  Joseph and the  Ama  zing   Tech  nicol  or   Dream  coat   at the West Virginia Public Theatre.We always have fun on our group outings, so this should be no exception.I hope that when we go to McDonald's (likelast year) that the roof starts to drip water, and then break out into a rushing waterfall coming from the ceiling. I guess that is West Virginia for ya!   I almost forgot. I applied for the part-time position at Scott Lynn Square 1-Hour Photo. Let's hope this works out.  That is all I have fornow.
