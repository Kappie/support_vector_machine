On wednesday the week is supposed to be catching up with you, but you're getting used to it, you may even begin to be looking forward to the weekend. That was not today. Today was DEFINITELY a sunday. You've done all the interesting stuff on the Friday and the Saturday so on sunday you kinda wander around the house knowing you should be doing work of some kind, but purring it off because its still the weekend.   LOTD :  Ever wondered who owns Channel ten? then felt disappointed that a large portion was owned by a canadian company? No? i have. If you ever do you can find out  urlLink here . Did you know that VH1 and MTV are both owned by Viacomm?   I saw the best product placement on  Merrick and Russo unplanned  tonight. Well it wasn't product placement per say - it wasn't  planned  (get it). What happened was that one of them had duct tape on their chest (I missed that part) and he tore it off. One of the members of the audience asked to have it so she could sell it on Ebay. Everyone knows that to get the product said costs double than what it to get it seen. Then she repeated it - twice. Even to the extent of claiming she was the "Queen of  urlLink Ebay ".   Thank you and goodnight. Hopefully tonight will be better than last night when i couldn't get to sleep until 2 a, because...well never you mind why
