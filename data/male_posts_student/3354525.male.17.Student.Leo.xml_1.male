I decided that since I hadn't checked for spyware for a few weeks, this might be a good time to do it. After scanning I found I had 93 separate pieces of spyware. I went completely computer security crazy, and was on a mission to clean up my computer and get it running back at full speed. I downloaded a neat program called HiJack This!, which scans your computer for all running processes and startup programs and lists them neatly. It makes it very easy to get rid of the junk you don't want on your computer, and it catches everything AdAware misses. You can download it  urlLink here . It's also a great site to visit if you have any spyware or virus problems. After reading a few different posts I was able to quickly determine what should and should not be on my computer. I strongly recommend it to anyone who thinks they're computer might be infested.   urlLink      urlLink
