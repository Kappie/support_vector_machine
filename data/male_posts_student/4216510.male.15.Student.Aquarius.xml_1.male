You can always talk to your friends, your true friends, even how unintereted they are they will always give yous ome helpful advice. You can always tell your parents, you might not want to, but you can. You can always call someone ; and you can always have something to do. You can always make your own decisions.  The reason I say this, is because...   I dont know actually.. I've decided to break it off with Natasha, she's not smart enough for me. Actually, she isn't smart enough for a monkey. She kept on asking my friend for me to 'officially' ask her out... well that wasn't going to happen. I told her from day one I would never actually go out with her. But she won't stop being interested in me. But I think she's started to lose interest (starting to go for my best friend.. too bad that ain't happening either...lol)..  And mah best friend, recently found an interest in trying Pot. I told him that if I ever caught him smoking a joint, I'd take it outta his hands and break it. And he knows i wasn't joking. I'm very against drugs. Now alcohol, might be a different story, but drugs are just retarded. Don't get me wrong, I don't drink ( -____o ) .. but I condone it more than I do drugs. He says he won't start doing drugs, thank god. But somehow I think he'll try it... I hope he doesn't, but if he does, I jsut hope he doesn't do it on a regular basis.  Well, I just needed to put in a new entry outta boredom... I'll talk to you later Mr. Fake Blog Reader Guy    Paul
