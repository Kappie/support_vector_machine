My questions are: How serious can these drunken people at Miller or Budweiser Brewery can get? (beer comes from Europe and mostly from Ireland (Oi to Ireland) Which presidential parties are they going in? (example: Miller the Democrats or Budweiser the Replublicans or the other way around.) What about NetZero HighSpeed Internet (I know a show that the guy in the commercial is in)? They're doing it in their commercials. What party are they?   If you're a politician who some how got on Blogger, shut the fuck up, I don't wanna hear you're fucking comments about my profound, yet disgusting outragousness in my fucking articles. This whole fucking site is for people who can just go up to someone and stand up between torment and say, "Fuck you, fuck you, ya cunt, you and your friends can just suck your little cocks as much as you want. But don't fuck with me, if you do, you will die an unholy death. Therefore you will perish, fall into the depths of hell where you were born.". Maybe not that specific, maybe the first two words or if you wanna step it up a notch, maybe the first sentence or second. What I'm trying to say is only liberal anarchists can read these articles or just anyone except christians and republicans because they might find my site "discriminatory" or "racist" in some small, tiny way.
