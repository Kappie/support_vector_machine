I mean yesterday ended crummy, but today was a good start to a good day. For once mom didn't really hold grudges....well that much....well anyways yeah....other than that...  Today also was D-Day's 60th anniversary, game 1 between Lakers and Pistons, and Patrick Sackville's birthday. Yeah so a lot can happen in one day haha. Today @ Church was alright too...great speaker. Hmm then history project...our Heritage Minute...  Yeah that pretty much sums up my day. I made a whoop-ass civics brochure....and yeah I'm done for now haha.  Later.
