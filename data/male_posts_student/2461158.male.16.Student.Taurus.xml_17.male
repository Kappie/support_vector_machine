Last week was the Christian Worldview Student Conference... oh man... That was like freakin' awesome! I don't know how else to describe it. I had a great time with some of the best friends a guy could have. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. An elephant! ha ha lol. (Ben's Haiku.) So yeah it was great. Hi to all my friend's from CWSC! So let's see there was CWSC all last week and then this week I started Driver's ED... yeah. This first day got me like all worried cause it seemed like it was gonna be tough but then it got better so I can't somplain. The homework is pretty time consuming though. So anyhoo... tonight is the men's meeting, and I still haven't read the chapter... crud. I guess I should go and do that now. So that's what's been happening in my life. Oh and by the way don't think this updating is gonna become like a regular thing ;) Laters!
