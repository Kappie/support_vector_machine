Over the years it's been a plethora of Treks Star, a variety of Joss Whedon shows and just about anything sci-fi with good plot and dialog. The best part of television is that for about six months you have a friend with you every week. Continuing story lines, familiar characters. Someone to associate with.   It's hard to let go. All Good Things was one of the first. Saying goodbye was hard even when you knew the feature film was just around the corner.  Tonight I bade another friend farewell. Angel went off the air with what was, in my opinion, a very satisfying final episode. It resovled nothing - and yet left me with a sense of resolution nonetheless. The show was about making a difference (or the lack thereof) and the real stuff that people who preport to be heroes are made of.  We still have Smallville. Of the holy trinity - Buffy, Angel and the Boy of Steel, only Kal-el remains.  The summer approaches and we shouldn't be watching TV anyway. But I'm still going to mourn the loss of my friends.  Seems silly when people are dying around the world - but fuck you. Who are you to judge what's important to me anyway?
