'well how do you think i felt?' *laughter and cheering*"  nevermind. good humor is usually wasted on unemotional things such as this. anywho.   i think i really need to get a haircut. i have super-long, jet-black hair, right now, in the summer. not a good mix. but a haircut costs money and i still owe money to people plus i have other ideas for my paychecks... so i figure i will see how long my hair will get before insanity takes over or i cut it. hmmm... i tilt my head back and look into a mirror just to see that i have grown myself a black mane. i am brejchamon!! hear me roar!!   i havent held a deep conversation with anybody for quite a long time. hmmm... i really feel like having one though. how odd... damn the rain. i have a sudden urge to go running. i am completely out of shape right now. wow. i have the peculiar ability to completely change the subject within the matter of about two sentences. yay. i'm turing into Glick. now if only i can get tilting back in a chair while flipping a pencil down...  hmm... i want a journal. something i can write my inner most thoughts and whatnot down in. i get paid today... this week sometime a journal i shall have. wait. did i already say something like this in a previous post?? oh well. i tend to that kind of thing often.  books. i want books. now. tons of books. hand me something to read please. dan brown is getting old. his books generally have the same plot. person dies, person 2 goes to investigate, person 2 meets person 3, person 2  3 investigate further and end up getting themselves too involved, person 2 almost dies, person 2  3 finally solve the murder. person 2  3 fall in love. the end. BORING! hmm... as you can tell, i'm over that genre. "i want something else, to get me through this" (third eye blind) but anyways. my brudda wants me to get off the computer now, my computer. oh well. he is going to be trying to get some sleep i guess. this is brejchamon (with the mane) signing off. sayonara.
