They are characterised by a brownish-black mask across the face, a brownish head,black feet and legs, and a black tip on the tail. Ferrets' short, buff-colored fur becomes lighter on the underside of their bodies.   Wild ferrets hunt like prarie dogs at night but ocasionally they are active above ground during the day  Black-footed ferrets produce about four or five young once each year. Born in May or June, the young do not come above ground until they are six weeks old. Mothers and young remain together until about mid-August. At that time, females begin to separate the siblings into different burrows. From August through early September the young become increasingly solitary. By early October they are able to take care of themselves.
