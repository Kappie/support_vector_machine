I went to the city today to go see my optometrist and he told me he had to dilute my eyes so he could see the back of them. I was like "Sure no problemo, do what you want". He said that the drops wouldmake everything glary (is that even a word?) and i would probably need to wear sunglasses on the way back home. Anyway, everything looked normal afterwards and i said i didn't need sunglasses because everything was fine (and i didn't know what glary meant). He said i should wear some sort of eye protection and i refused. The moment i stepped out of the building, sunlight reflected offevery shiny object in the vicinity somehow magnified itself and forced itself into my eyes. So this is what glary meant. Everywhere i turned light and glare and man was it annoying, especially going over the bridge where the sunlight reflected off the harbour. So if there is one thing you learn out of this blog, it's that listen to people who know there profession really well, or you'll probably regret it. (N.B. It's nice to see that our blog is sufficiently alive though i reckon we could comment a lot more)
