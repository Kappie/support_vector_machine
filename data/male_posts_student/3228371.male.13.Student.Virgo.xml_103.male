So I just came upstairs and blogged. Yesterday was soooo much fun! Haha! I was like... hyper. But that wasn't even considered "hyper" hyper. That was just moderate. If I get REALLY hyper... haha! It'd be scary. ^^"  Wow... grad's only 2 days away! The day after tomorrow! So scary! :S MONDAY~! I think Erica had an extra ticket for Auntie Amy, I don't know. That's what Auntie Amy said. I'd have invited Ames (Amy Wong) to come to our grad but I think she might be busy with school and other stuff so yeah. Busy busy girl.   Ahaha! Okay so yeah... recap on yesterday and the stuff I forgot to type up about. So... [person1] was majorly macking on [person2] and it was sooo obvious but then [person3] started macking on [person2] also! That surprised me... that [person3] would mack too. Interesting. Not like [person3] to mack. Oh well, whatever.  Erica and Karen were talking outside the kitchen while we were all being hyper outside and yeah. It was fun though. When my mom came to pick me up, Sally came out with a huge container full of water to splash at me 'cos I dumped a cup of water on her so that she'll get an excuse to use the little container of water that she was holding "just in case" somebody gets her wet. I knew she wanted to join in the fun 'cos not too many people were getting her wet so then when I was approaching my car, she splashed the whole thing at me anyway, getting my jeans wet and also a bit of my car. Tiff ran over and whispered to her that she shouldn't do that in front of my mommy (smart thinking, Tiff! too bad Sally doesn't think that!) but I said it was okay anyway. Doesn't matter. I'd go home and change anyway. Hehe! Drove Sonia home while Martin and Gordon stayed behind. Blehhh so much fun! Hehe!   Can't wait until next Bethel. Probably won't be another water fight but it'll BIG BIG WORSHIP on July 2 so yay! June 25 there won't be fellowship (ie Bethel, SALT, etc) because they have councellors and leaders training for the camp. Nima's supposed to come on July 2 for the BIG BIG WORSHIP but I don't know... It might not be for sure that he's coming so whatever. I think I'll probably have more fun there at the worship than he will 'cos it's not just about music. I love BIG BIG WORSHIPs 'cos I actually mean all those things and I sing it with a passion for the LORD. Nima... he's not exactly Christian and he wouldn't sing there anyway although nobody can hear anybody since it's so loud. Blah... there'll probably be a message to and scripture reading and the usual so yeah. Meh, whatever. I've gotten used to Nima not being able to go to Bethel anyway even if it's not for Christianity which is okay. So blah. Like I said, I balanced out my life and I guess the times when I go to church is DEFINITELY a time where I get to enjoy praising the LORD and serving Him alongside my brothers and sisters in Christ.   Might to golfing with Jae after coming back from Nima's instead of having lunch and then going outside with him... Gotta ask mom... gonna go now. BLog later.
