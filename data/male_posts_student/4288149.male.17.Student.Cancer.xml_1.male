A lion becomes a griffin, a horse becomes Pegasus, and a hawk becomes...a double hawk"               - Demitri Martin  Well that was a fun night. I arrived an hour early for the show, so I went to Fopp, bought  a slightly interesting book, read it in Starbucks for a while to pass the time, then returned the book. Very sneaky. Demitri Martin was interesting. He's American so has a different sense of humour, therefore having different stage qualities to British comedians. He was pretty funny, but not as good as someone like Bill Bailey or Ross Noble.  Afterwards I went round to John and Matthew's and we had a little birthday thing for John with some of the other YFers. Then Stephen turned up with all the Banchory people. So there were about 20 of us crammed into John's living room, so we went into the paddock to play football. Until 3:30AM. Then I walked home. I'm tired.  Hmmm. Good things and bad things are happening right now:   Good:  I ordered a box of boosters from the Champions of Kamigawa set for £45, which is £1.25 per booster, which is quite nice. 6th Year is coming up. I got some more Pratchett books.   Bad:  I don't know whether I can go to the Papashaw bowling invitational, because of the 6th year buddies program, which I have to stay on at school an hour for on Tuesday to help organise. Grr. I can't go to Stephen's gig because I have to babysit my brother. Oh well, at least I'm getting paid. I can't go and see the Mad Caddies because it's in Glasgow on a school night. Aaarrghhh!  Ok, well that's it for now, but thanks for reading this far.  - Tom
