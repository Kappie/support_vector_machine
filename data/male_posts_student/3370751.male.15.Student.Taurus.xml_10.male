For example, me and  urlLink Ben  were talking after the orchestra concert--which was a disaster by the way--and he asked me how to spell 'spot.'   Me:  S-P-O-T, Ben...   Ben:  Okay, what do you do when you see a green light?  This was it I thought, the point in time where I was going to show him I'm no idiot.  I mean, what kind of question is that?     Me:  I stop.    I looked at him with a triumphant gaze, but all he could do was give me one of those "you're a stupid moron" looks.  And then I realized what he meant.  SINCE WHEN DO I STOP AT A GREEN LIGHT?    I hate jokes.
