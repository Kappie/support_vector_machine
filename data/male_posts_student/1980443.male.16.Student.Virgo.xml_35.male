It's called "It's not about me".  Now, if you know me, I have a tendency to think the opposite!  And I don't have a problem with admitting it, just a problem with thinking it and doing it, lol, anyway, it's really cool.  It starts off by expaining how we as people in this small small world compared to God's Son - ARE THE MOONS!  Jesus is the Sun.  Our whole purpose is to REFLECT, not make our own, light of the sun,  the application is very clear.  We simply need to do exemplify the love that Christ shows us.  Before we where the sun in our lives, but now it's Christ, everything revolves around him.  Keep that in mind!  It's incredible to think that the whole.... everything that will ever be is by him and for him.   summer's easy.... Keep it real, I'm Will
