MARK! i missed mark. we decided we should go over there, smuggle TP and then TP her car. off to marks we went! not only was jenni and mark there. but also katie fast, joey, brad, and i think tyler may have been there. it was exciting. by this time i really had to pee. so i excused myself. i began searching the bathroom for toilet paper, but to my dismay, the toilet paper was absent! so i took the remaining toilet paper along with 2 feminine hygeine products. we informed them that cassie had to be home at midnight and so we "left". oh ho ho ho we didnt really leave. we came back. and ....we tp'd. michief makers 2004 struck once more. after that, the fun finally ended and i took cassie and rose home, but the good times continue rolling.   now the reason i am writing about all this, the events of my evening is really kind of a simple thing, and may be really unimportant to you. but tonight i realized how badly we need to have uninhibited fun. just do whatever you want say whatever you want and surround yourself with people who totally dig that. tonight i didnt think about anything bad, anything negative, i just had an honest feel good time. i hope that the summer has more of these nights in store me.   dear cassie and rose- thank you so much for such a fun evening, i really think the 3 of us should hang out more. pizzacatto? hmm..  dear mark- even though i know you wont read this, we should hang out more like back in the old days. you're a good guy, i love ya bro.   g'night  neil  PS i think i'm going to post some pictures now. wheeeeEE
