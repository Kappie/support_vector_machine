The sandwiches on their menu: Turkey Breast, Italian, Vegetarian, Pizza, Smoked Ham, Tuna Salad, Chicken Salad, Meatball, Roast Beef, and Peanut Butter  Jelly.  Things you can add to "any sandwich" for 50 cents -- extra mushrooms, extra cheese, extra ounce of meat, or extra marinara sauce.  I wonder: how many people have ever ordered any of those things on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  :)  An extra ounce of meat!  Ha!  (This kept me amused for way too long... much to the non-amusement of my friend I was eating with...)  Also, random fact of the day: the average 30-second commercial spot costs $343,000 to produce.  That's a lot of money!
