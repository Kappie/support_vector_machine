Sunday went swimming at Carol and Penny's with the Mum's, that was really nice, got some excercise and some badly needed sun.They gave me my birthday presents and brought sushi.l Yum!! Yesterday rested for a while, watched a lot of B5, then did pilates, laundry, and some badly needed chores around the house. Only had two smokes yesterday, none today so far. Have been thinking that it is time that i cut back, on the drinking as well. Am getting way to close to depression to be drinking so much. Really have been feeling the need to get more active and brood a little less. Hopefully i can snap myself out of this funk before it gets too bad.
