I mean the talk of love was so cheesy and sterile. There were so many logical gaps too. Oh man and the brief showing of a cross when Neo sacrificed himself was just plain stupid.  All I can say if there's any live action anime or a Superman movie... they'll have to top Neo vs Smith. That was pretty cool.  After the movie, we went to a cheap Chinese buffet... actually I've never been to a Chinese buffet that has had ghetto Americanized Chinese food.   When I got home, I chatted a bit and slipped into a food coma. 11 hrs of sleep is nice.  ***
