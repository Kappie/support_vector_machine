However lets not speak what's  on  the News, but  the  news itself and how it effects (my own) lifestyle. Back in my poly days I was a big news junkie. Part of my daily routine would include spending an hour half to 2 hours just hitting all the news sites on the Internet, followed by another 45 minutes of reading the E-mails I would get from the newsgroups that I had subscribed to. Even my girlfriend then, towards the end of that time, was going to (and now is) study journalism. When I enlisted, part of the problem early on was similar to a "News cold turkey" which came from being cut off from the outside world (and the above mentioned girlfriend of course). Would "waste" away my precious weekends just trying to catch up on the week. And it only got worse when I was posted overseas.  The other subject I like to touch on seems off tangent, but I will link it all back later, is radio. My interest in radio has waned much since the growth of digital music and the trend of personal music that arose from it, which I am a firm supporter of.   However since the module that I'm learning now focuses on media and broadcasting, I've started to regain more respect for radio in the fact that it's actually the most up to date media in the area of News. It's a wonder why I never thought about it before and even if I did, why didn't I implement it? Like my module states, radio is still around because it's so pervasive, it can be found anywhere and is cheap.  So perhaps I should look into getting a small hi-fi or standing radio and keep it on the news radio channel whenever I'm at my desk, that should allow me to ease off the need to "waste" time getting   >  to search my news sources. Of course, I still have to get my Tech and Gaming News but that should still cut down on time significantly.   Maybe all this could revive my interest in the News, which has waned considerably over the last year or two. I wonder why? Perhaps it's the need I found to focus not so much on the things or people around me and focus more on my wants and desires, of which I found to be lacking of late. Selfish? Perhaps but that's for another time.    >
