"The Law, It Is A-Changing"  Another tough case with An activist judge While for strict constitutionalists Law won't budge But a liberal court Can be swayed by the facts And the precedent's rapidly aging And the judge sees distinctions That may not be real And the law, it is a-changing  A hundred years one way But times they have changed But regardless, all's needed Is one judge who's deranged The opinion's a muddle Of policy talk And there's no tellin' if This is stickin' Or if they will appeal And this case overturned But the law may be a-changin'.  Come senators, congressmen Don't play it cool It depends on the Congress To pass a good rule Make it airtight and solid To withstand judges wild There are activists here Hearing cases They'll be hearing the victims And swayed by the facts Oh the law, it is a-changin'.  Though students have learned it It all could be moot All the memorization Destroyed with one suit The rules and the standards Can flip in a blink The old law is Rapidly aging Let's come up with a new one They can't understand Oh the law, it is a-changing  Exam is tomorrow But Westlaw is wise The key to the course Changing before my eyes All the students who study Are studying wrong The law's different now than this morning And the right choice before Will fail cause the law  Oh the law it is a-changing  Education is quickly outdated Cause the law it is a changing...
