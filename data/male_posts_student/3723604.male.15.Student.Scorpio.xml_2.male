It actually looks like someone when apeshit on a smurf in there.  Today, we're going to put up a border between the blue paint and the white paint. It's a 50/50 mix, so the effect will be pretty sweet. Alas, when my dad was taking off the floorboard, he snapped a piece off. He's going to Jew it back into shape, but it's like "Damn dude, be careful next time."  I'm finally going to go all out on my diet. Screw this weblog, I'm going to shed some pounds before school starts.  -Reb, future GQ cover model.
