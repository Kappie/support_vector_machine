Not necessarily because the professor used this cool outline mapping program that made it really easy to tell where we were, what we were talking about, and how it fit into the larger picture, although that was fine.  More because he was actually alive and engaged, and engaged the class, and I felt more interested than I usually do sitting in class.  There are other professors here who are also good, and a handful that are quite excellent, and I've had a few of them.  But there are enough that are just OK that I forget sometimes how much of a difference it makes, and how much more enjoyable -- instead of just tolerable -- class can be with the right professor.  I know I'm cynical sometimes about all this law school stuff.  But good class today.  I'm pleasantly surprised, and impressed, and happy with my choice.  And the casebook's not bad either.
