I got in a fight with my mom and cussed her out. 2. After my fight with my owners, I snuck out and got caught 3. I called my older brother, and told him I was gonna run away with him, and my mom heard me.  So yeah, I cant do much now without parental supervision, and I have to go to Stagg next August, maybe.  FUCK
