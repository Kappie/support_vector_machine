It's about 240 pages, with guitar tabs for 30 of their songs. The only problem is that I can't play 1/4 of that stuff. EVH is too amazingly awesome for me. Oh well, maybe when I get better...      I also played through Call of Duty...again. It's a fun game, especially when you're a Russian, because then you get to see your "comrades" get shot by their friends for retreating and being a "traitor to the motherland." Good stuff.      That's pretty much it. Damn, I have to find more things to write about.       Talk to you later.
