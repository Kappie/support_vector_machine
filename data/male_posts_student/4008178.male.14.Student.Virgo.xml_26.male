"you woud kill a cat? what did the cat do to you in your life?"  at least in my eyes, its the same to kill a cow, than to kill a cat, than to kill a squirrel, than to kill a fish, than to kill a human. youre still a killer, you took someone's life away.  so why do these people complain so much? i mean, maybe i'm not vegan, but if i went vegan it would be for the good of it, not so that only one animal loses its right to live.  anyways, my dad just talked to me so i lost interest in going on writing. i guess you get the idea.  bai.
