BUT  the punishment has just begun, for less than 72 hours, we shall once again suffer the torment that is our english exams.... damn, i wish i would at least reach the overall average of a fifth-honored.... well, as i see it, my grades aren't that cracked up to be because i have not been studying well these days, maybe because of social problems(class war), poor time management(wow, i'm applying values ed) or i'm just plain lazy....  in fact, i have not been myself these past few weeks, some of my friends noticed that i have changed a bit (i don't know if it's for the worse or for the better though), but that's my little secret.... but i felt that i have "returned" to my "original-self", if you may... i'm becoming more ryan-like once more because of an intresting conversation that made me realize the person i am..... sorry if i'm talking nonsense....  well, this is my first blog and i hope y'all would like it... just live with it, okay?  peace up... ryan here, signing out.....
