It was so hot out too, I was sweating like mad. That's okay though, when I finished I had a nice cool shower. It felt good.  Tomorrow is Canada Day and this town goes smoke-free as well. Now we have "designated" smoking areas and we can't smoke anywhere near/in a place of business. It's a joke in my opinion, but whatever. Laws are laws, and I guess the majority voted this one in.   Work should be okay tonight I guess, we weren't too busy last night. I am hoping it drops a bit more today. Too many people calling, they have no life. Haha.  It seems like another storm is coming in, the TV is cutting out and I can hear thunder in the distance. Shit, I have to catch the bus to work today too. I better not get rained on!   I am in the whole natural mood of things right now, so here's another poem I wrote:   As dusk is descending, the stars entrail in the night, The sky is pleasant pink, meaning sailors delight, The breeze is so passive, and gracious in it's advance, The trees seem to whisper, and move slowly at glance, The lucidity of the ending light, is mindful at heart, Today is now ending, and a new day will soon start, As the sun sets in the west, the moon is now distinct, The night and day for just a moment, are conspicuously linked, I look into the night, and observe the dark sky, Which persuades me to say, "To this day, good bye"  Â© 2004 Tyler Kuhk  Words of inspiration: Accept life for what it is.
