This is my first time back at school full time in almost 8 years and my first crack at post-secondary so I was understandably overwhelmed by all the choices of classes and unsure what I needed to take.  Now, as long as the classes I want are available when I register, I will only need to go to class two days a week.  I'm only planning on taking 3 classes (the minimum full-time courseload) and I should be able to schedule them all on Mondays and Wednesdays and not have to start until 10:30am and finish around 5:30.  That would leave me all day Tuesday and Thursday to do homework with the evenings and weekends available to work and snowboard.  How great is that!  If everything goes well, I'll bump it up to 4 courses for the second semester.  From the sounds of it I don't want to take five courses at the same since the average course requires 10 hours (including 4 hours class time) of attention every week and that would be 50 hours of work not including extra time to study during exams and trying to coordinate essay writing time.  Better to make up the credits by taking summer school.  Not much else to report today.  Going to the gym later and then to watch the fireworks finale tonight.  I hope y'all enjoyed the handrail photos; my Dad had a glazed look in his eye when I showed him and then asked perplexedly, "what are those for?".  I'm sure the snowboarders will understand.
