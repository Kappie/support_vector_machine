I still had sunburn, which made my scratch even more painful to touch, and I changed clothes.   I was wondering about Hannah all day. I haven't called her up on a date in a very long time. I've been busy and stuff, but that's no excuse to keep her waiting  this  long.  I just haven't worked enough guts to do anything. I'm either too conservative or too cowardly. Probably too cowardly, because of the Millenium Force incident.  I checked my mail, worked up to pace and worked ahead of even that. I started programming, and my brother started bugging me to play a game called Easy Money. He took my chair and threw it out of my room and cursed at me for not agreeing to play.  So how does he expect me to play against him after he cusses me out every day? I don't see what his problem is, but it needs fixingâ€”and fast.  At about 11:45, I saw Hannah log into AIM. Usually she never goes on AIM, and neither do I. I was surprised. This was the first time we've talked in months. We talked for about 15 minutes, finding out more about each other's summers. Then we both said goodbye and logged off.  I wrote three blogs with happiness.
