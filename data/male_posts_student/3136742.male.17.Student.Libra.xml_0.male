He constantly rambles about knowing everything because he was "in the navy 8 years, 6 months, and 2 days" (never achieved high rank and the closest thing he ever saw to combat was a taking over shipload of Honduran counterfeit Levis). He is almost 40 years old (looks at least 46), is unmarried, only wears sweaters, and is obsessed with his cat(s). Every night he goes home and reads every word of every essay, every paper, and every test handed in to him.  I'll give the man (and I use the term "man" very loosely) credit where credit is due; he does know his history... Teaching it is another thing though. At 1:10 the class begins to fill in as students start coming in from lunch or other classes. As everyone takes  15-25 minutes  to find their seats and converse, the pompous "great teacher" stares off into space, or tries to become part of any lame teenage drama going on. Then he addresses the class quietly, in his tiny, mousy, lispy voice. He mumbles to the class and himself what he wants to cover in the class, and points to the notes he wrote on the board. The notes are no more than key words that can only serve as memory joggers, if it's even at all possible that they can be even  that  helpful.  After breezing over the notes, he goes back to his desk, and back to either staring at us or trying to start drama and controversy between the social group of academic stars that he wants so badly to be a part of.... On the board, though he never announces it and most people don't even know its there, is our homework. Since he doesn't go over our chapters and materials he writes our required reading on the board (usually 5-15 pages of our history book which focuses solely on expanding our vocabulary and knowledge of the English language, and barely touches on helping it's readers learn more about history... This book's writing is so complicated it usually takes a good reader 5 minutes to read a page and get anything valuable from it). He spends about 1 minute of this 80 minute period teaching, 4 minutes reviewing the chapter, and 75 minutes sitting and pretty much not doing anything (sometimes he'll moderate the occasional class discussion)... So however great a student this guy is, that gives him no right to say he is even a "teacher" at all let alone a "good teacher." He has a lot of confidence and self esteem issues, so he feels it necessary to play the tough guy or the know-it-all. He tries to make himself feel like a hot shot by showing us his extensive knowledge of history (he's found ways of doing this without teaching us a single thing) and talking about how he teachers his class like a college professor. If that were the case he would be teaching college. He's no hot shot, he's just pissed off that he's a small, balding, weak, middle aged man with a speech impediment who wasted his youth on academia. He takes out his frustrations by picking on his students... and all the wannabe somebodies in the class love the guy, which is ironic because he is their future.  After reading all of this you may be asking yourself "What the hell is he getting at?!"... well, here's what the prick assigned us at the return from spring break at 4-14-04: -12 page min. Term Paper on materials he has not and will not cover in class. He just handed us 4 historical documents (about 15 pages worth) and said "Find 3 internet sources for each and write a few pages on each. -2 page min. book report (this is a history class, mind you)... this isn't so much of a problem, but I can never write anything shorter than 4 pages, and the month is already half way over. -4 page min (I believe) essay on the chapter which he still hasn't gone over all of these are due around the same date. At the same time, we all have to read two chapters of the history book (2 hours of speedreading), study for the test, and do our short term homework.... all for one class... the dude is such a bitch.
