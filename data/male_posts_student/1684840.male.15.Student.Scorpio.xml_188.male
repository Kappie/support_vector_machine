We have the chance to go to Alton Towers and stay in either the Arabian Nights suite or the Oblivion suite, so that will be amazing!   I was called for in the evening buy Craig, Chris, James and Jo. We met up with Kayla, Tasha and Emily and we all went mad for a bit. James jumped on Craig and they ended up rolling in dog poo. James got it all over his knees and Craig on his t-shirt! Mr. Poo and Mr. Shit-Knee (as we nicknamed them) went mad trying to get it off whilst we ran off hehe. James went in shortly followed by Jo, Craig and then Chris.   Me, Tasha, Emily and Kayla then went to Kayla's house for a few minutes until it was time for me to go home. We didn't havea long time out tonight but it was a bit fun. James was mad, but when isn't he? I miss Sam, he is in France and I haven't seen him since last Tuesday. I need someone insane to talk to!
