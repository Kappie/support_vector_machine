I met her in town and we just hung around there most of the day. We went to see 'The Day After Tomorrow' and wow, what a film. It's really amazing and kinda makes you think a lot. Then I started feeling weird and seriously thought I was gonna throw up, but I had a burger then everything was fine. Then we went to Jilly's for a while. I actually danced, with very little alcohol in my veins, and... I enjoyed it! Whoa. A first. Everyone from college (who actually never go to college) were all surprised at my hair and someone called me pretty! I saw the usual people I see on a Thursday (Ash, Jenny and Ellin) and I met Ash's boyfriend (unsure of his name, but he was really cool and so easy to get on with) and her friend Jenny who spoke to me about college and Download and various other crap when everyone ran off on me! Also, saw my friend Sarah and her boyfriend Andre. She was the first person I spoke to in Jilly's, ever! Mandy and I had another pathetic fall-out over trust and paranoia, but all got resolved in the end. The bus ride home was so fun (in more ways than one...)! Some really funny guys got on and they were making me laugh so much, but then when some other guy got on the bus who looked all gothic and stuff, they weren't so funny. For no good reason one of them started on him and was really punching him so hard. So pointless. A girl who works in 5th Ave. got on and sat with us for protection apparently. She's never heard of Slayer!!! Pffffttt! It's so weird how in society there are some people who are really nice and some who are complete cocks! Oh well. It's Friday morning right now and I am kinda bored stiff. So, bye bye.
