Let's see if the whole group actually makes it out today.  Hopefully nobody has to "go running," or "pick up his sister," or "do this thing."  Hopefully everyone's cell phone is functional and doesn't go to their mailbox after two and a half rings.  Hopefully everyone actually has there cell phones and doesn't "forget" them, even though they go nowhere without them.  See a trend here?  Anyway, the movie should be dope, especially if everyone heads on out.
