Today I got up pretty early.. about 7 or so, I think.  I was mad at my Dad, like always when he wakes me up on Sunday mornings.  It must be the way he wakes me up, or just people waking me up in general.  I'm always in a bad mood when I wake up.  I'm sure it has to do with the fact that it's annoying for someone to interupt your sleep.  Sleep is such a vital element to the success of humans.  When my vital sleep gets interupted, I get pissed.  Anyways, I finally got up and we went to church.  After, we went to Perkins and ate breakfast.  I had the usual supreme burger... yum.  After that, we went home.  After awhile we all decided to go to the Iowa City mall where I looked for some shoes.  I figured I needed something other than basketball shoes to wear.  I get sick of them sometimes.  I tried on a bunch of different shoes.  I liked Dr. Martens the most.  It just so happened that in all the stores that had the style I wanted, didn't have the shoe in my size.  Yeah bummer.  But all was not lost, because after eating Subway, we went over to Best Buy and I got the 'Shiver' import Coldplay single.  It had two songs I didn't have, or at least songs I didn't have on CD.  Nevertheless, I wanted the CD just so I could look at the amazing cover art.  So I was happy about that.  Listening to track 2, "For You" makes me wish Coldplay did more piano oriented music.  Their tone with the piano is always brilliant and beautiful.  The kind of music that makes you want to learn how to play.  Well, I suppose from that you could say I had a good day.  Maybe I did or maybe it's just my mood right now.  I think listening to Coldplay puts me in a good mood.  I can't think of anything else to say right now.  I think I should be getting to bed now anyways.  Song of the moment: "For You" by Coldplay  Good night.
