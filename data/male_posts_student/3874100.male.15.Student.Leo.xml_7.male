Well, there is clearly only one buddyfuzz, so I tried to log in, and it worked!  Anyway, what's going on?  Well, school has officially finished for the summer, which is a relief, what with the awful exam results.  But I'll do better next year...yeah right.    I have camp in a couple of weeks, but apart from that it's two months of guitar playing/excercise...and seeing friends...and party's...and fun.. yay!  Anyway, I'll keep you updated, Jonny.
