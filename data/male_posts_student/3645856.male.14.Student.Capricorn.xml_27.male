All i've been doing since my last post is sleeping and trying to get better before vacation comes... Once in a while I get up and check my posts on hipforums or look at ebay or something like that, but other than that, I feel like shit. This is probably the last post before I go on vacation because we're leaving early tomorrow morning... See you June 10th I guess..... 9th, 10th, 11th... I don't know when i'll be back. Maybe if I get to a library, i'll post an update or something.... but i'll probably just be moping around the hotel trying to get better.... ugh. Why on vacation.  ~ George  Music: Jimi Hendrix (I don't even know what the song is, but I know it's Jimi Hendrix... I think it's called Angel) TV: The last thing I watched was some soap opera on NBC (You know how it is when you feel so crappy you don't feel like changing the channel) Mood: How do you think I feel.
