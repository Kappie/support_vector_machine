The Queen’s Counsel, a litany of supreme Over-Lords, and The Children Are Unbeatable Alliance have joined forces to remove what Lord Lester “described as ‘the serious social evil’ of child punishment.”  The ‘anti-smacking’ lobby group deem reasonable chastisement to be outrageous, an offence to the rights of children. Lord Laming said: “the defence of ‘reasonable chastisement’ – the loophole which effectively legalises smacking – had ‘no place in our society’. The moral entrepreneurs of this age have united in an effort to distort a message of discipline rooted in love, turning it into crusade against wicked parents who ‘violently abuse their children’. The worrying aspect about the impending legislation reform is the emergence of an outright ban. Assuming that a bill is passed in government enforcing an entire ban on chastisement, followed by the formal implementation of such a bill, a frightening scenario of prison could become a reality for many loving parents who take their parenting instruction from the Word of God. “Under the measure, parents could be prosecuted for actual bodily harm, which carries a jail sentence of up to five years if their smacks lead to grazes, scratches, minor swelling, cuts, abrasions or bruises. Reddening of the skin would be permitted only if it were transitory.”  Under a complete ban on chastisement, genuine love could land you a 5-year stretch inside, serving time for correcting your child’s behaviour for their future well-being.  From a worldly perspective, ‘discipline’ and ‘correction’ are nothing but dirty words from a by-gone era; designed to impinge our individual freedom, and make our lives a living misery. Chastisement is soon spoken of as smacking, and smacking has soon turned into fully-fledged violence. Everybody has their own individual right to behave as they wish according to their subjective morality, without fear of consequence, or risk of punishment. It is amazing to witness the moral outrage that is set ablaze when a child leaves the womb and is then mistreated. When the paradox of abortion and ‘smacking children’ stares you in the face with a dumbfounded expression. We should all be in agreement that violence towards children is absolutely abhorrent. The humanist revolution has nonetheless attempted to attach the label ‘violence’ to chastisement. Chastisement being pure and good, divine wisdom from God; violence being contrary to this, aiming to destroy and demean. How can our society and politicians pretend to care about the well-being of children when the unrighteous slaughter of thousands of children is happening up and down the country in ‘respectable’ abortion clinics? “The low priority the Government has given this issue (chastisement) reflects badly on its commitment to our children’s well-being, and its decision to allow Labour peers a conscience vote on a partial ban, but whip them to reject a total one, shows moral cowardice.” The only cowardice that exists in our current government, is the fear of speaking truth, the back-bone to stand up for what is right, and the political will to stick with good policies regardless of their popularity.  What was once unthinkable has now become thinkable, the unacceptable has become acceptable. We have tried to move ancient boundary lines, to suit our own selfish needs, re-working them to accommodate for the fads and trends of today. The Hippocratic Oath, which goes back more than 2,000 years, was tampered with in the seventies and eventually replaced by the Declaration of Geneva. Medical students upon their graduation used to take the Hippocratic Oath, swearing to: “maintain the utmost respect for human life from the time of conception.”  The sanctity of human life was once important. The preservation of human life was the very basic, founding principle of the medical profession. Conveniently, for some, it was decided in 1971 to drop the last five words of the oath, making abortion a justifiable practise. So doctors could now show utmost respect for human life, albeit not the unborn life. Chastisement is oppressive – Abortion is liberty. Our society is severely schizophrenic. “The schizophrenic nature our society became further evident as it became common practice for paediatricians to provide the maximum of resuscitative and supportive care in newborn intensive-care nurseries where premature infants were under their care – while obstetricians in the same medical centres were routinely destroying enormous numbers of unborn babies who were normal and frequently of larger size.”  If you do not introduce the abortion debate, alongside the furore surrounding chastisement, then you are missing the point. Both issues deal with the capacity of our society to care for those who are weak and have no political voice. Real child abuse, this ‘violent’ smacking of children is directly caused by our willingness to allow abortion. If you fail to see the correlation let Francis Schaeffer shed light on the situation. “Is it not logical, after all, that if one can legally kill a child a few months before birth, one should not feel too bad about roughing him up a little bit (without killing him) after he is born? Parents who are apprehended for child abuse must feel that the system is somewhat unfair in that they can be arrested for beating their child, whereas people who kill their infant before birth (at an “earlier age”) go scot-free – in fact, have society’s approval.”  There would be plenty of other disturbing instances to showcase the selective tendency of administering live-saving healthcare, juxtaposed with the complete disregard for human life, shown by proabortion doctors. Whether we genuinely care for people is highlighted in how we treat the weakest in society; the unborn, a gift from God. They have no say, yet we choose death, allaying our guilt by saying it was only: ‘Foetal tissue’. “Viable or not, the single-celled fertilized egg will develop into a human being unless some force destroys its life. We should add that biologists take the uniform position that life begins at conception; there is no logical reason why the proabortionist should try to arrive at a different definition when he is talking about people, the highest form of all biological creatures.” The chastisement debate is another effort to move away from Biblical principles, a ridiculously superficial argument dwarfed by the continuous murder of children in the name of women’s rights. Things have become so utterly twisted, it is frightening to imagine what other evil practises men can conjure up and call them ‘good’.  I was chastised as a child. I deserved it. It was just punishment for a naughty act. My parents had nothing hefty in the armoury, but it would hurt nonetheless. I would be spanked for my disobedience and ill-behaviour, twelve times with a wooden spoon spoke a language that I understood. Red skin, Oh yes! No bike rides for a few days, extra cushioning on seats, sleeping on your side, and some stiff walking. Ouch! Five times NO to a child of two can sound like YES in their ears. If a simple NO is not sufficient, other tactics are required. I love my parents. I love them because they smacked me in love, knowing what was best for me. “He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.” Chastisement is about love, careful and considerate love. “Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is stupid.”  Chastisement is wisdom; lack of correction the fall-down of a fool. Discipline which momentarily stings produces good fruit in the end. I know that my God loves me deeply when he disciplines me. Disciplining me so stay on the path of life. Maybe the No Pain – No Gain situation is true after all. Whatever happened to the human race?  Resources: The Independent 6th of July 2004 The Guardian 6th of July 2004 Whatever Happened To The Human Race? Francis A. Schaeffer   “If a mother can kill her own children, then what can be next?”  Mother Teresa  “I've noticed that everybody who is for abortion has already been born.”  Ronald Reagan  “If people are not made in the image of God, the pessimistic, realistic humanist is right: the human race is indeed an abnormal wart on the smooth face of a silent and meaningless universe. In this setting, abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia (including the killing of mentally deranged criminals, the severely handicapped, or the elderly who are an economic burden) are completely logical. Any person can be obliterated for what society at one moment thinks of as its own social or economic good.” Francis Schaeffer  “We should avoid weasel words like ‘smacking’ and ‘tapping on the leg’. Hitting is hitting.” Salman Rushdie  “We should avoid weasel words like ‘foetal tissue’ and ‘genetic matter’. A baby is a baby.” Patrik Harper
