Choir ended late, and let me tell you, it's gonna happen tomorrow and Thursday too. So, don't expect entries from these two days. Yeah. Right. Lets begin on....   Monday   Right. What happened yesterday? Lets go down in chronological order. Right. That poor pitiful KWQ!! His hand is in such a heavy heavy cast! Oh my meowing mooing lord! So ke lian!   We had no PE today, so we had 1.5hours free! Wheee! How fun is it to be free? Very fun! What did we do ar? Bascially, I just lazed around while CQ did Chem. HaHa!   Okay. Something very interesting happened in GP today. Hmmm! That MCP made a terribluy narrow-minded comment! Yes! He incurred the wrath of everyone in S22! Weeee! Now his unpopularity is on the rise! Even ducks could meow at that. Basically hor, he said that ITE students are all stupid and they all smoke and dye hair. At that comment, everyone went 'OEI' and shouted "narrow-minded!". Even Khairul wanted to punch him. HaHaHa! Benjamin shot down every single of that MCP's points, and everytime he did, all of us applauded! HaHaHa! Wheee! When class ended, everyone went out of the class muttering how nuts is that MCP is. HaHa!   Right. After that classes are boring. Okay. Choir. Today's choir we had rehearsals with the band. We went out at 6 to practise singing the National Anthem with the band. I remember all too well during my Sec3 years, where the choir and band collaborated to disastrous results! I hope RS won't repeat past mistakes! Ergh...it was horrible. They couldn't hear us sing! Here we were, blasting our guts out loud and getting really tired, and what do we get? Criticism! Ergh! Ergh! Ergh! Actually, choir today wasn't that horrible la. At the end, we sang John's song (the rap part) so nicely that he was so happy about it and everyone's mood perked up! YaY! Finally! :D  Okay. Coming back, I am swamped with homework. I have to do Chemistry and also 3 mini-book reviews for Chinese. Sigh...I finally completed at 11! Oh yes! Phoebe finally got married (I forgot the groom's name! AHH!)! YAY!! Monica the control-slave-wedding planner is so totally hilarous! HAHA!   Tuesday   Right. What did we do today? Relatively little. It's kinda boring la. Yeah. Me and CQ kept asking Miss Yee about Physics assignment. HaHa! It looked like I've made a mistake with calculations. HaHa! Silly old me.   WQ removed his cast! O.O His right arm is still numb though. It practically has no feelings in it at all! O.O Poor thing!! Ayioh!   Right. Guess what? I've signed on to being a beta on FictionAlley. HaHa! Beta basically means I am an editor for authors. So far, only two has signed on with me. I am not sure about one, whether he wants me or not. I am currently editing the second's fic, and I loved it a lot! There are some errors, but not too much to make the pages red! Heh heh! I am so having fun.  Of course, I wanted to try writing a fic. I am now writing for this Title Challenge. I chose the title  Fear Of Flying  to write about. I am asking if my storyline would suit the title. I want to touch on the metaphorical 'flying', not the actual physical one. Yep.   Ya know what? I gotta get going now. I am so darn tired! See ya next time, eh? TaTa! Night blog!
