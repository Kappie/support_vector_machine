Even so, the 3rd one was a goalless draw. Not exactly what I would call exciting. Holldand went thru on penalties. Better than England...Beckaham's penalties simply rock. Yup. High AND wide. Tragicomic.  Crashed on maths(due to remedial lessons with Mrs Chung being a flop). Took me until 11pm yesterday(so no soccer) and worked non-stop today. Finally finished everything so I can rest and do this entry. Holiday homework still far from over though(CRP  AS for  returning to school...I think that life should be better tahn the previous 2...I hope. Perhaps ot's just blind faith, but I am fairly resolved NOT to cause trouble next term and hand up more of my stuff on time. I hope.
