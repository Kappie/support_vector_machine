      Yo yo yo. I am so far behind on this crap. I don't have the internet at all anymore. That really throws a kink into everything. I have no idea what I'd do if I couldn't just pop over to FSU and use a computer lab. If things go my way and I'm not in class in the fall I won't be able to do even that. Shudder. I've finally moved into my new, clean, maggot-less, carpeted place. It's so nice. I actually cooked myself dinner the other day rather than just stare disgusted at a mess of a kitchen. It's really a design flaw to have the main door lead into the kitchen anyway, I think. Mud gets in there, and flies spontaneously generate, and bees and roaches-- gross. Now my kitchen is off to the side. No disgustingness. I'm so happy.   I really used to like Dennis Miller, but recently he just seems to be some kind of right-wing voxbox. He just yells on his show how it's ridiculous to think that if America is the strongest country in the world we still need to listen to what the rest of the world thinks. Well, I say you can't bully people, or eventually they're just going to hit back. I mean, the concept may seem ridiculous, but there could be a EU USA conflict at some point in the future. I also don't like the uberpatriotism that really took hold after 9-11. The kind where liberals have to qualify every thing they say that may be against the administration. This so-called "United we stand" mentality is extreme to the point of massive excess. If you have a different opinion that Bush, you are against America and may as well sign up with the terrorists. The right-wing has really forced the left into a corner in which they can only meekly make suggestions while prefacing everything with "Now, I love America," or "America is the greatest country in the world," like somehow what they say negates that fact. It's really shrewd politicking. I'm not American, but you know what? I love America, and it is the greatest country in the world, but Bush and crew have donetoo manymessed up things and it's time we mended what wounds we have with other nations and lead by example, not force. Sorry to get all political in this blog. That's more of a Jane Blah thing, I guess.   I've now gotten to the point where my extreme fear of roaches is ridiculous. When I was cleaning out the old apartment the other day there was this huge dead roach in the tub, but I refused to go near it, out of the fear that it may suddenly come back to life just to run along my arm and say "Hiya, pally!" I swear, they know I hate them and just come to hang out on purpose. I'll go to friends' houses and hang out, and then there will suddenly be a roach near me when they haven't seen one for months. I have always been a fan of comic books, and deep down inside always wanted a superpower. Only now in my mid twenties do I realize my superpower is the ability to attract roaches. Hooray. I'm the Disgusting Roach-Man. Look out crime.
