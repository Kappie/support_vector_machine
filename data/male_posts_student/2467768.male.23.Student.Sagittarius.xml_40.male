She is in Singapore.  This show technology have change our life. The defacto is that I do chat with my galfriend everyday. I always feel so near to her. But realising that she was a distance away from me.  I just want to see my Dad badly. Give him a good warth hug from his son. And today after Isyak prayer, Shiek Abdul Rahman, spoke to us about a Hadith regarding death and funeral. I am really sad when I heard that speech from him. He really make me feel that I want to go home.
