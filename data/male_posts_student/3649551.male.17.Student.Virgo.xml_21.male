But I don't place nearly as much importance on church attendance as most Christians seem to. There seems to be a very common and very incorrect view about Christianity these days. I'm not talking about merely non-Christian perceptions of church, but of a mistaken viewpoint shared by a lot of Christians. A couple weeks ago, I was telling somebody about how I would like to go to church more, but don't feel inclined to force myself. The person I was talking to asked me something like, "Well, don't you think you should practice your religion?" If I hadn't been thinking long and hard on that subject for a few weeks, I probably would have made the same mistake as the person who asked the question. (Not to tearhim down at all ... he simply illustrated what I already said is a very common view.) Practicing Christianity does not necessarily take place in a church. A practicing Christian is out mingling with non-Christians and extending love to them in various ways. Meeting physical needs, emotional needs, by just being there and not judging. That's what practicing Christianity is: loving and witnessing, but accepting and not condemning. And certainly not foolishly pressing people to believe what you believe. Church is training for real-world application of Christ's love. It's a place to grow in your own faith, but to focus on brothers and sisters in Christ. It's a place to practice the extension of God's love. It's a place to practice servitude. A very big part of it is learning more about God's Word.  But (and this is the major point I'm trying to get across, so it's italicized):      Listening to a sermon does not mean you are practicing your Christianity. Just showing up is not good enough. Your own faith isjust the starting line for your ministry to others. Don't be selfish with the knowledge you have. Do not, do not be content with your own salvation! Getting saved from death is not the goal of a person's life - the focus is not death, but LIFE, so live a life that strives for Christ. Spread His love and prove that you believe.   If you just show up at church, you're training for a game you have no intention of playing. Start playing.
