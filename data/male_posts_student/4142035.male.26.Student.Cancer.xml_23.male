If things keep going this way, people are going to end up dependent on these things to get around. Everyone scooting around on Segways and Lark scooters because their legs don't work right anymore.  America is the fattest, laziest and most spoiled country in the world. Wonderful country in many respects. But people need to get off their asses and go jogging.
