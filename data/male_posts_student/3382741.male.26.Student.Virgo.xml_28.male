When I drive I attempt to be polite ... and it often costs me time and a great and frustration.  I am so sick of inconsiderate drivers that I wish I could carry a gun and shoot out the tired of anyone I see doing something stupid becuase they can't stand to wait 0.2 seconds!!  I mean I realize that in a car ever 0.1 seconds can feel like a full minute (or 30 minutes of "having sex time"), but still come one poeople.  ANYWAY guess i am done ranting ... for now
