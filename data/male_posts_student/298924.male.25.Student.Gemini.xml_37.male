WRONG....  Because I spent the entire weekend moving, I had to neglect my studies....that equals another L taken on a Gross Anatomy Written test....mind you, I am in NO danger of failing the course....I locked up at least a C long ago...still this concerns me.....I need to do well on the subject board test at the end of the course to keep my dream of being a surgeon of some sort alive....  But how can a brother focus when his new, freshly renovated (meaning I am the first living being to sleep within these particular walls) apartment has no hot water?....I mean a brother thought his cold shower days were over when he left  urlLink Morehouse  ....  On a brighter note I drank some excellent Glenlivet and ordered Digital Cable earlier today....I am looking forward to getting the mother of all haircuts tomorrow cuz I look a hot ass mess right about now...  Gotta head back to the lab now....One!
