I set up banquet halls for those of you reading this that don't know what I do for a living. Anway, Aflac had 400 or so people in their group, all drunk as hell of course, and the AA group had nigh on 1000 people. Now, at 5:00 p.m. the Aflac group left the room so we could clean off all of the tables, about 40 or so, and reset them for dinner. While this may seem easy, trust me, it wasn't. There were beer bottles, bottles of water, food wrappers, various pieces of paper, and other random crap all over every single table. So we went around pulling that crap off the tables while the banquet servers set plates etc. down behind us. The group was supposed to be back in in 45 min. Needless to say they had to wait a bit longer, the sloppy bastards. Then, as we're putting ice and water into glasses, we run out of ice in all three of the ice bins. ALL of them. So, one of us had to gather money and go to speedway to raid the place of their ice supply and then, with my help and the help of two other guys get it offloaded from the bed of the truck onto a flatbed and then unloaded into the ice bins. All eighty bags of it. Once that was done we had to rapidly fill another 300 glasses of water and get those to the servers, *cough* fuckin pussies *cough*, to put on the tables along with the dinners. Once that was done we had to go into the room that the AA group was in and straighten all 1000 chairs in 30 min and replace the water jugs with new ones. Now, through all of this we had the client services people, the ones who work with the clients on getting everything right for the meetings, breathing down our necks about piddly shit that they could do themselves, except for the fact that their too concerned about breaking a nail or breaking a little sweat. Now, this is what really pisses me off about last night. My scheduled shift was 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. Well, the Aflac group didnt break til 2 FREAKIN A.M. So I, along with the rest of the set up crew, had to stay there till 3 a.m. to get everything cleaned off. The one funny thing about last night is watching all the people in the AA group have to pass by seven bars fully stocked with alcohol. Yes I know its not right or funny to laugh at that but I'm sorry, it was funny. *sigh* I'm done rambling and ranting now. Peace.
