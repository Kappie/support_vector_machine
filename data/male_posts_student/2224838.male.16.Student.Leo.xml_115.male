Just watching all of the seniors get their diplomas made me look forward to next year. Not only do I look forward to graduation, but I'm also excited about all of the things that I get to do as a senior. Yeah, that's pretty sappy.  My school year came to a close today, as I took my first and last final in Precalc/Trig. Luckily, I pulled through with an A on the test and an A in the class. Along with the A that I got on my chemistry test on Tuesday, I now have a 4.0 GPA for this semester, which was completely unexpected. I seriously thought that I would get at least one B this semester, but somehow I saved myself at the last minute.  On another note, my photo teacher let me borrow a Lomo LC-A for the summer so I can test it out and decide if I want to focus on Lomo for my portfolio next year. I'm surprised that he would trust me with it for the whole summer. I think I'll go sell it on eBay.  I guess I don't have any exciting plans for the summer, now that it's here. I'm basically just taking a government class, looking for a job, doing some volunteer work, and hopefully visiting a few colleges. In between all of that, I'm going to sleep as much as possible.
