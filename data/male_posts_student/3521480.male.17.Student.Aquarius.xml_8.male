Gradually my mum and grandma have been buying more and more cat things (food, then litter, then taking it to the vet) and now he has been givin the tour of the house. Apparently, he (named Max Cat) is our cat now. my mum has been the biggest supporter of having a cat, and ironically she is leaving the country (tentitavely for good) in 3 weeks. im a bit iffy on the subject, but hopefully it will work out and keep my grandmother busy and less concerned with me...  Oh well, cats are fun to have around, i just hope my grandma can remember to take care of it so it wont be me constantly doing everything. this SAT is annoying, and i  have  to study for it if i plan on doing better than a 1210 (SAT equiv. of my PSAT score), so i best be off...
