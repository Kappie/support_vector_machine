Q-Tip had declared Hip Hop dead at one point.  I think it's at more of a singularity, it's changing too fast to understand what's going on with it.  I guess hip-hop's in a dark age, it's renaissance was in '88 and since then it's been in a sharp decline.  Take for example 'sucka free sunday' on MTV.  The whole damn thing is devoted to hip-hop, and it would seem great, especially the best of 'sucka free sunday'.  The host was this reasonable (as I'm talking about just body) looking girl.  Who was reasonably, if archaicly (looked kinda 80's with her shirt and earrings), dressed.  Don't get me wrong though she was really pretty, no perm or any of that straight garbage, I guess I'll call the hair style bi-racial (as in black-white) hair, since that was it's texture.  So she shows all these interviews, says community alot.  Then suddenly it switches to G-Unit.  If you don't know me, then I guess my hatred of G-unit isn't known to you.  50cent was what? A crack dealer?  I mentioned previously that I think all crack dealers should be murdered in the most painful way.  But if that's not bad enough, excuse my language, but this guy goes and niggerizes (oh it's a word) these women in his video.  He has two black girls on a damn leesh, and the whole song is about him being a motherfucking PIMP....  I can't stand that.  I really can't stand treatment of women in rap videos, since it's almost exclusively black women who are having their image torn apart.  What eludes me even more is why the black feminist movement isn't strong at all.  They have plenty to mobilize against, and our community has a huge amount of internal improvement that it needs to go through before we can actually sue for change in the greater society as a whole.  But somehow, the black women in the community don't seem to be attacking the issue hard enough.  Are black women's psyche's that damaged from this attack on their meme complex?
