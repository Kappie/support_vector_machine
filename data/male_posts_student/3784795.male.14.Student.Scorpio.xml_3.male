Rather than doing any real work, he parties, hangs out with friends, and hits the clubs. A real party animal.    Strengths : Always having fun and in a good mood. Good musician and dancer. Quick reactions so he can crack witty jokes with perfect timing as well as drive at incredible speeds and not get caught or injured.    Weaknesses : Fast cars, excitment and adrenaline, women, In-N-Out, Subway, Taco Bell    Hobbies : Dancing, playing in his band, shooting pool, swimming, eating   At night, he becomes a masked warrior, who is all about discipline. He hardly speaks, but when he does, he makes sure it is wise and profound. When not off fighting crime, he will stay up all night building up his strength, practicing his fighting skills, but mostly meditating. He needs to meditate just two hours a night to equal ten hours' rest. He shares his alter ego's love for speed, adrenaline and excitement. Thus his nighttime transportation is the same as his daytime: a sleek, incredibly fast convertible.   He distances himself from other people so as to not get attached. Because he is so emotionally closed, he is known to cost the lives of innocent people. But, that also means he can perform death-defying stunts without fear.    Strengths : Does not value his life.    Weaknesses : Lack of physical strength, need for independence. Does not value the life of himself or his friends.    Hobbies : Swimming, meditating, horseback riding, physcal training.   Alright..thinking as I type here, but how about these are two different people. One of them is a warrior, a refined yet ruthless hero against evil, and one is your every day party animal. Through some strange phenomenon (which is the birth of every comic book hero) the two people are combined into one being. In the beginning, they were fighting for control all of the time, but that proved so tiring and pointless that they agreed to share control in shifts. While the spirit in control had complete control over the body, the other could still communicate to the other.   (I'm on a roll, here) That way, when in public, the casual guy takes over, but in the privacy of their home, the hero takes over, building up strength. At night, the casual guy sleeps mentally, while the hero continues to train and meditate.   Thus, they have created an interesting relationship with eachother, and provide mostly differing opinioins with each other.   Awkward moments are created when the casual guy is in control in public when the hero notices a crime. The casual guy must make a quick excuse as the hero takes over and runs to help. His friends are always baffled by his seemingly bipolar mood shifts.   Wait. Try this out: The hero had established a reputation, and an villain had a type of chemical/nuclear/experimental bomb that would explode a busy nightclub, hopefully killing all the innocent people inside. Among those innocent people was the casual guy. The hero tried to prevent the explosion somehow, but he could not, so he got everybody to evacuate. And once he thought it ws all clear, the casual guy stumbled out of the bathroom. The hero dove just as the bomb began to explode, and landed on top of the guy to protect him. And so, they were fused together.   Now please. If you managed to read this far, leave me a comment at the bottom of this blog entry or in my dA journal telling me so. And while you are at it, advise me on what I should change, what you like about it, and what you think their names should be.
