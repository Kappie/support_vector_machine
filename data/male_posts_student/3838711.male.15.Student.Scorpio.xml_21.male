I suppose today was practically a normal day, with nothing much to say in particular. the rain that came in noon kinda made me feel refreshed from the morning heat, and it kind of felt good, since the heat these days were unbearable.  In class, Sherman was like talking about the days he spent in Bernice's house.. sleeping on the same bed... doing some stuffs which i, personally, suspect a lot. (Sherman did clarify things, but heh, i doubt hes kinda truthful about it...) he was like kinda scared smth would happen... u know, big stomach ? So much for encouraging pple to have birth in SG... well here's a great proposal... encourage teenage pregnancy, den 100% the birth rate would go up man.. skyrocket like no tml~  After school Sherman headed for Century Square to whack WMMT again (man hes RICH) and he kinda jio-ed me.. but like i said before, i need to resist the temptation of WMMT and ID for at least a week, i dont want this mood of mine to let me have a faulty run, and waste my money. Hope that things can settle down soon. as expected, i declined his offer, and made my way home straightaway.  Going to see a bit of TV den do my homework now.. well i guess thats the end of this entry... Ciao !
