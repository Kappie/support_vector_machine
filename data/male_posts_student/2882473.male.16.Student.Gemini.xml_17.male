If you are a keen reader of my writings here, you may have read about a vandalised bus stop I came across on my journey home from school a while ago. It had the glass smashed in, and graffiti over the rest of it. A few days later the glass was fixed, and the bus stop cleaned up. Now, about a month later, not only is this glass smashed in again, but the glass on another bus stop across the road has also been broken. These acts of pointless vandalism make the town look dreadful and be an unpleasant place to live in. To fix these, it will cost the government money, which is in turn comming out of the tax-payers pocket. I HATE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THIS! Although, this does remind me of something my physics teacher told me yesterday. Most homes have electricity comming in at about 240V. Old factories have electricity comming in at a few thousand volts. If someone were to vandalise these factories, and the electricity supply hadn't been cut off completely, if they smashed the fuse box, or inlet of electricity, they would almost certainly be killed, as electricity at that high voltage can 'jump' through the air. Serves the damn kids right.  On another note, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS COMES OUT ON DVD 2ND APRIL!!!! WOOO!!!!! In Uk anyway...
