Then he didn't do anything all day.  He played some video games, watched some tv, and just took it easy.  Really he did nothing.  He talked a little bit online but that was pretty much all.  So he had a very slow day after a string of really busy days, or just tiresome days.  He did have that feeling of missing the fact that prom was over.  It was just so much fun.  And now Tyke graduates in a week (whoa, one week from today Tyke graduates high school) and he leaves for Europe in just over a week meaning he will not get to see anyone for a long time.  Then he gets back on the 5th and has his wisdom teeth out on the 9th.  So he is a busy little boy.  But it will all be fun.  Damn, Tyke feels a little hot right now.  Hopefully it doesn't mean anything.  Tonight Dr. Phil, Kinker, and Macaroon came over to Tyke's house.  They played a spirited game of Risk.  Tyke probably should have won.  He made a few miscues, like allowing for Kinker to take out Dr. Phil and thus get his cards which meant that Tyke lost his upper hand.  And then he just got pwned on some rolls which hurt him later on.  The cards also weren't in his favor as he had 5 of the same card and 2 of another so instead of having two sets, he only had the one and couldn't turn in 2 sets of cards at once, thus getting a humongous bonus.  But in the end Kinker played it well and won.  Then they played MOH and hosed some Bromley's and then finally finished the night off with ESPN.  Trenton Hassell and Luke Walton are better than Allen Iverson and Chris Webber.  That was proven.  And Luke Walton is better than Shaq too.  Just so that you know.  Tomorrow Tyke gets to go see Harry Potter and hang out which will be fun.  Hopefully he has his car though as they might be taking it in to get an appraisal.  But that will come later.  Now Tyke's bed is calling.
