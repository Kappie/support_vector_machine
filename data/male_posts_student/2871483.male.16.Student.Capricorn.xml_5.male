I guess you could use it to make a point, but it does kind of take you away from the opinion. 2. Racial/Sexual/Homosexual slurs will not be tolerated.  3.No name callingunless you're intending it to be friendly.  4.Do not post an opinion without reasoning if you hope to discuss it.    If you follow those simple guidelines, I have no beef with you.     -Praise or Haze-    I've developed a good way to make a fun arguement when you want to. If you chose to makea topic in which you can post something that you want people to argue with you or say how much it sucks or something, put "Praise/Haze" in the title. Simple. Deliciously simple.
