Tata lay on the bed. He looked bad. I went over to his side, held his hand and sat down. His eyes were half closed. NO! They were half open and from the moment I got into the room, I saw the trembling. He couldn't hold me very firmly, but it was good enough to let me feel his weakness. Each time, his hand pulsed in mine, the more and more upset I got. I asked to be excused to go to the toilet. I went out to cry.    He's been diagnosed with pneumonia and they've been jabbing him with needles every day and his legs are thin. He's not eating I think, coz he's trying to reduce his stomach size. It's bloated for some unearthly reason. So I sat there holding his hand and he trien to turn over to kiss me and we were all like "nonono... wait.. get rid of the thermometer first". I was the first to see his temperature. 40.1 degrees. That's brain damage level boys and girls. I was so damn scared I tell you. He spoke in a weak voice and called me Vairam, then Ian, then Timmy. I never realised how much that meant to me. I might even tell you why another day.    One thing ticked me off. The fact thatDaddy showed up was nice, but then he started telling Tata about how he was rushing a New Creation Pastor to come down to see Tata. I mean DAMMIT! Stop shoving this stuff down histhroat lah! I was embarrassed. Not of The Lord, but of the way Daddy thought.Dammit! He's not going to die! He can't!I prayed later, watching my words, whilst everyone stood over him. Midway, he said in a warm, weak tone, "heh, thank you raja". He calls me "Raja". It's "King" in Tamil. I knew he was happy. Thank you Tata.    I went back down today after drama and dance which ended by 7.40pm. I can expect this figure to rise in the ensuing eleven days. I've been having alevel7 cold today! Abysmal thing makes life miserable.I turned the corner andhe saw me and smiled and I knew things were better. His grip was better and his movements wer'nt as painful to watch. Thank Jesus! I held his hand a bit more today and felt better about things. I know it's serious but it doesn't seem that way to me. I wonder what being in shock is like. I think things are on the upswing, but there's thing in me that prompts me, every now and then to think about the worst. I have to convince myself that everything's going to be alright.    Cheryl- Sarah Lee didn't come to school today. I'm not in love with her. There's something about Cheryl. Something that I've not seen enough of in the past few days. Maybe it's her smile, or the brown rubber band she uses to tie her hair. I look for it to find her during assembly sometimes. Maybe it's her laugh. It's an honest laugh. You don't hear many honest laugh's anymore. Listen.    Yes, this girl's pretty special if you ask me just because she's sprightly. She makes me hapy. But she's fizzed out a bit recently. Some thing might be wrong. And it's sad. Even in a SMS, you'd feel her through it. Is the aura. Anyway love, if you're reading this, pause, know that you're loved by many, assess what's wrong, and lean not on your own understanding. There's no problem too big, God cannot solve it. And by the way, I've got major issues when it comes to family relationships. It's just not reflected in my life. It probablly is here though. So if you, or anyone else reading this needs someone to talk to, Tim's your man.    Tim's your man and that's my personal invitation to you reader. We know each other and I don't believe in shallow relationships. I've been through family issues and I know a thing or two about what it's like to have abuse, and disintegration of various ties abounding. Shall not go into too much detail here, but the base line is that if you need anything, gimme a call or send me an email.    I know I'll not get a call, I'm not expecting one for aseemingly cheap promise on a blog validated by words.But when you feel all alone and the world has turned it's back on you, gimme a moment please, to tame your wild wild heart.    Oh! And please keep praying for Tata.
