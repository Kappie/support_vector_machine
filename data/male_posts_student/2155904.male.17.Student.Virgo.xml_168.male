First two periods had no SNAFUs and 3rd period was the dumb Sanders test.  Multiple choice and 3 essays in a 38 minute period.  That actually wasn't that long.  Tyke finished with about 15 minutes left.  He hardly knew anything but still he wrote a lot and finished the test quickly.  Then 4th period was gay again.  Dyke-bitch went psycho again and was just being gay.  Really quite annoying.  Quite indeed.  Lunch at Pie but the smell stuck to Tyke and it came with him for the rest of the day.  In physics they did a lab and it was kinda fun but still lab work.  And Tyke didn't think Purdy was being a bitch at all.  No problems there.  After school Tyke had Amed, Dr. Phil and K-caj all over for some bball.  Then Piggy J also managed to make a very nice appearance.  They played Shithead for a while before gathering up and heading to Sunny Hills Elementary for some bball on the court there.  The court really screwed the guys up.  Except for Amed and K-caj.  They pretty much dominated for the first like 3 or 4 games.  Tyke didn't play in 2 of them though.  But Tyke had no traction it seemed on the court and he didn't exactly want to get injured so he just took it easy.  But then Tyke played well again and he helped Piggy J to beat the dominating monsters.  But Amed and K-caj played recklessly and with heart which is something Tyke really wasn't putting into his game.  Just pretty moves and dribble-drives.  Which were still pretty fun.  It got so nice out that Tyke and Piggy J even took off their shirts.  Just a nice picture for the lady-readers of the blog.  That one's for Dotti who let Tyke wear the necklace she made for Piggy for some of the day.  It was itchy but nice too.  Well Tyke and Piggy came back to Tyke's house and they played more and more Shithead as Piggy was finally getting used to it.  But Tyke dominated for quite some time.  It took Piggy 10 games to finally get his first win.  But it was fun.  Then Tyke had pizza when Piggy J left for home.  Tyke talked with his dad for a while and watched some baseball and basketball before Dr. Phil, Amed, and Kinker all came over for some more fun.  This was some good times.  They played cards and watched some of the Lakers game but then they got a great idea.  They decided to play Risk.  Yes, the game of global domination.  And boy was it ever dominated.  Amed and Dr. Phil didn't exactly remember how to play/know how to play for the first turn so they royally screwed themselves up.  Tyke just flat out owned and he got his Australian continent bonus right from the second turn as that is what he always goes for.  It was perfect.  Then Amed tried to get a pact with Dr. Phil so Tyke decided that he would just do the same with Kinker if they got one going.  But instead Tyke just took over Africa and Europe and Kinker took over the rest of the world and helped Tyke knock Dr. Phil and Amed from the game.  So the two guys who most wanted to play Risk ended up getting taken hardcore by the two vets who wanted to play but were not so enthralled by the game that they were just dying to play.  It was a lot of fun but Tyke and Kinker won.  Then they played ESPN.  The first team was Tyke and Amed and Tyke carried the team of course because he has the game but Amed did a good job of not screwing up.  They beat the other team pretty well with the Suns.  Then Tyke and Kinker were teamed up and they played as the Clippers against the Lakers.  And yeah, they just owned that matchup.  Just owned.  Then came the best game.  The Charlotte Bobcats (expansion team for next year) against the 1980s Eastern Legends.  It was a very close game that came down to an OT win by Tyke and Kinker as the Bobcats.  Then they played some MOH and read some blog.  It was a really good night.  Hopefully tomorrow will be a good time.  Tyke might play some baseball/whiffle ball/something but he isn't sure.  And he should be playing basketball/hanging out with Kramm but he isn't for sure yet.  So that is all but Tyke is not done for tonight...you know what.
