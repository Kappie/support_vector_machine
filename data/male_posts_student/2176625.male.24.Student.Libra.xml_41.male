They like Leslie but the case-in-point is that we are not married, we are not getting married, we are not together anymore and there are no plans to get back together. My grandmother looked as if she were going to have a heart attack. My mom cried. My step-mom said that if my father were alive to hear this he would be disappointed. The only person happy about this news is my sister who is pregnant herself.   The only thing that saved my sanity is knowing that my sister is on my side through this.
