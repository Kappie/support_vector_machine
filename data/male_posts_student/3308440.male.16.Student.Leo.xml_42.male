So that was interesting and later on I had to go to school to get my timetable for the start of September, when I got it I had half of my lessons missing from it, damn lack of communication between the college and the school... ahh well at least they have put me in for a subject I did not enrole for it's a course called  "Critical thinkin"... as soon as this got described I thought "oh great it's another English course!" well I was not that far off what it is, is looking at some text and describing it!?!? I suppose I shouldn't complain really because it is an examinable course so I now have the possibility of gaining 4 A (S) level's (I have no idea what A levels and AS levels I am in for but hey ho) thatâ€™s about it for now, see ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Tired  Current music: Coolio - Gangsta's paradise
