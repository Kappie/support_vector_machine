The sun is out and the days are long and so are the nights because, for two weeks only, there will be no sleep because the Stanley Cup finbals are here.  Yes, I know that the Americans are inconsiderate to be putting these things on in the middle of the night so that they start at around 1 in the morning, so you have to find something to do before then and they finish at about 5 am so there really is no point in going to bed before getting up for another working day, but I wouldn't swap it for anyhting. My team may have been knocked out of the competittion up to three weeks ago but that doesn't matter. I've got a new team to support for the next little bit and I will follow them passionately until the end of the season.   The say that it is the hardest trophy on all sports to win. Whilst this may be the usual American way of just not counting anything they don;t understand or take part in, it may be quite true. Whereas there are six mnths of battling during the regular season, all this counts for is positioning for the last two months and to select your opponents. Weird things always happen, this year the champions of the Western division ended the 82 game regular season in sixth, but none of this matters as they are considered the best from the west.  Suddenly, people you've never heard from before are hogging the headlines all over America, and, on the other side, one second of madness at a crucial time can undo a brilliant season of work and could (and has) lead to you being run out of town in disgrace.   Whilst I would have liked to have seen my team triumphant, it is nice to see that two teams who are considered to have less history and glory than many others are fighting it out for the big proze. Go them.  Now to find something to do until the next season comes around.  Jack
