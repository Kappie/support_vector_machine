She's got a damn nice body :)  I've been in the retro music mood recently, as I am typing I am listening to  Come Back To Me - Janet Jackson  from the early 90's. But that is nothing, I have been downloading all the old Michael Jackson stuff from the 80's and even some Pink Floyd. Music like that makes me realize how shitty the new generation of music is. In a recent FHM magazine I purchased, one of the writers asked Slipknot  "What's wrong with rock?"  Slipknot came back good with the fact that  "Hilary Duff sells 7 million albums - which must be the first clue that aliens are on their way to earth to blow us up."  Amen to that. Even though I don't listen to Slipknot, that's a damn good point. What the hell is with the horrid music that's coming out nowadays.  *Sigh* Whatever.   It's not just the music in this world that is bad. The whole place is corrupt. People are so messed up nowadays, nobody has any respect for anything. What really bothers me is the lack of  SELF  respect there is. That shows how bad this world is getting. I don't have any faith it will get any better. Who's to say though?  I just caught Days, it was semi-good, I suppose. I think Jenn is being extremely mindless in that getting on a plane to see Jack. Even though he isn't "dead". I have so many theories on this so called "twist" they are pulling, but I am honestly baffled at them all. I can just hardly wait until the entire thing is played out. I am getting sick of waiting.   This post was somewhat long, eh? I wanted to quickly type a few things but as you can see I got all into it and babbled about a lot. That's okay though, that's the point of having this thing. My place to vent.   My mom just walked in with groceries  *Drool*, food!  I am going to get going. I am bored today so understand my typing needs :) Bye all!  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site
