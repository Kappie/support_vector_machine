Although, in some other parts of the world that happened hours ago, or will not for a few more. Though I don’t feel it, hear it, or feel it, I am told it's a new day. But what if it’s not really a new day, sure time is a universal thing these days. But what if this who thing called “time” is really none existent. What if it’s not a new day at all. What if it’s something else. Something much, much bigger. Everyone on earth asks at one point, ‘why are we here’ or ‘how did we some to be’ even ‘is there a something after life?’ Questions unanswered, questions that will never be answered, in this life time anyway. Our humble home that we call earth is just a speck in our galaxy, even that is just a speck in the universe. One only realizes how small we really are until they think about ‘the big picture’ Some days I just sit and listen to the trees wondering, ‘is this life, or is it apart of something bigger?’ No friends I’m not talking about heaven or hell. I’m talking about, is this real? Is this whole thing real? Or is it just a dream… Something we do not figure out until our part in this picture is over. Is this whole thing called life real? Something you should think about.  Until next time Rob.
