It usually happens when there's a girl around. We all know where all of my recent "relationships" have gone, and it really is depressing. But I don't know how to stop it. I'm always wondering if I'm doing the right thing or the wrong thing or if I'm going to get hurt or if she's going to get hurt or if I'm standing in the way of something...My brain is travelling at a thousand miles a minute, and it's showing no signs of stopping. I really do need to get away. A change. Something. Anything.  TAKE ME AWAY   I've been trying to write lately. I dug up an old piece of unfinished fiction, and have a poem going as well, but nothing seems to be working. The characters clash, they lack direction. The words don't fit well together. There is something wrong, something is very wrong in my world, but I can't put my finger on it. I'm not sick. And I'm not fatigued. And I'm not drunk.  I don't know. I just don't know anymore...
