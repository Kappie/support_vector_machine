To say something to someone's face involves being physically there talking to them...Not indirectly through pictures, electronical means, or saying that you "hate that kid" after they leave the room.  And, while it may be "astounding" that people can get around blocks, it can only serve to further prove the fact that someone has no life. i'd continue more with this but it isn't worth my time. -Matt
