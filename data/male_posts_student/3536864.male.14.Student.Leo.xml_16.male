Oh well, I guess it's good practice being organized and "neat"  during the summer so I'll be ready for next school year. Neatness isn't one of my strong points......but it will be. I'll make it one of my strong points.  I will Triumph!(my el guapo is disorganization)  Well, it probably won't be that glorious, but I'll get it down. This html thing is still plauging me...But that too! I will triumph!  I need an army doing all this triumphing.  Maybe I'll go hire one.  Alright, I'm out to hire an army, I'll be back.
