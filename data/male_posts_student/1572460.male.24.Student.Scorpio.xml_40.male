In a four-part blog, I decided to come up with a list of twenty rock songs (by nine different artists), that I feel you really ought to check out. As usual, I provide the disclaimer. Don't regard this list as a "best of" or "greatest hits" collection. Neither are these songs individually rated or listed in any particular order of preference. I've tried to pick songs that are not really run-of-the-mill hits. Meaning, a lot of these songs aren't predictable hits, so to speak, although they are practically still well-known and part of very successful albums by the artists. To further elaborate (if I may..), I have chosen songs by arriving at a certain degree of complexity about them. I find a complexity to rock music that is somehow emotionally very evocative, aside from the actual musical complexity of the song. The emotion is not necessarily sweet or soothing, at times neither happy nor sad. But, as a friend once said, there is no reason why an expression of emotion should always be sweet, soft and "less noisy", in order to be judged good or bad. So, if you are a fan of elevator music, a la Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears, and identify rock as "noise", here's your chance to grow up.  Okay, enough of grandpa talk. Time to  urlLink get rocking .
