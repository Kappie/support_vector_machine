I think it's pretty good. I think it's better overall than  Black Sails in the Sunset  and  Art of Drowning  in that it's easier to listen all the way through. The other 2 albums had awesome tracks, but I found that there were a lot of tracks that I was skipping over.  Today I'll probably go to campus and do some writing and go drinking with Jeff.  **
