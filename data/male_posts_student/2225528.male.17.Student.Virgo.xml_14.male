Sent my friend home after hanging out at the mall, sped back home.. for no specific reason for why I'm doing it.. I created a pencil sketched Jpeg format picture of me through "intensive and extensive" touch-ups by photoshop judging by the horrendous pictures I've taken.. and uploaded into  urlLink friendster .. took me about 1 hour for it to be done.. imagine that.. but I'm pretty pleased with what I did.. although I'm not that pleased with the face in the picture.. a good friend of mine claims that it doesn't really look like me.. sigh..     Finished Product:
