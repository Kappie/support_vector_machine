For the last three Mondays or so I've been working from 6 to 8:20 on homework (stupid essays), leaving on 8:26 and getting to school right before the bell rings. Stupid Lott marks you tardy if you open the door when the bell rings, though.    Man...24 hours a day isn't enough nowadays. Even with only 6 hours sleep. Wow, sleep deprivation really does have bad effects. All day I've just been saying really dumb things to everybody, or really just not wanting to say anything. And I spilled my lunch...those beef patty thingies are too heavy.  Track practice was OK, we left a little early...man I want to be fast. Then I decided to bike around a bit. It's dangerous riding a bike nowadays. Cars always seem to be trying to run you over as if you have a bulls-eye on your back or something. Maybe it had something to do with me biking in the street, I don't know. Also I passed an anti-war rally at the Hub. They were playing "I'm Proud to be an American" and had signs like..."50% of Iraqis are under age 15." It was all kinda funny. Then I passed Holy Spirit, they had a service on a Monday night? Maybe I'm missing something...
