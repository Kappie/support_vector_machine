Every shot I hit with the hybrid duck hooked, unless I meant it to do something like fade. In short, I am still getting used to them. My driver continued to be cold, until the fifteenth hole, which was my last, because rain was upon us. I finally remembered to stand closer to my ball and sent it 235 right down the middle of the fairway. Bogey golf in general, 90 if I had bogeyed the last three holes (a long shot). I was supposed to have a lesson with Jamie, but its still raining. It sure wasn't going to miss us. So I found out two things from the IJGA today. First, and more importantly, I was admitted into the chick evans junior amateur after being an alternate. So I get to play monday and tuesday next week! I also got a place in the palatine regional, so that's good. I think I'm pretty set on clubs for a while now, unless something breaks... Bye
