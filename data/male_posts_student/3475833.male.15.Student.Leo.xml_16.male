I'm sorry that the smart kid was stupid. I'm sorry. I can't say it enough. Thanks for being strong, but I'm not sure how much I can hold on. I'm going to try my best and beat myself over the head. It only hurts if I let it, right? If I just keep telling myself to keep smiling I will eventually listen, right? I'll be here forever. I'll never let go of you. You're my pride and joy. My heart, my other half. My heart will always long for your love. We'll make it through.  My feet shall run because of you. My feet shall dance because of you. My heart shall beat because of you. My eyes see because of you. My mind thinks because of you and I shall love because of you. -- Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider
