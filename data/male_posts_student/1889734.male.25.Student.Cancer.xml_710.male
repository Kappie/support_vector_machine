The author is a dentist and an Iraqi living in Baghdad.  Here he talks about the Nick Berg murder.  Please take the time to read the whole thing.  Excerpt-"So, to distance myself from the shameful hypocritical Arab and Muslim masses. I wish to denounce this barbaric act and the pathetic ideology that fueled it, to disown any person from my part of the world who would justify it, and to offer my sincere condolences and sympathy to the family and countrymen of Nicholas Berg.  And for Muslims, who are definitely going to say 'this isn't the real Islam':  'When you meet the unbelievers, strike off their heads; then when you have made wide slaughter among them, carefully tie up the remaining captives.' Surat Mohammed:4  Grow up, and leave the 7th century."
