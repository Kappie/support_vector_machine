The freshmen were taking their finals in shop so all the seniors just talked and talked.  Hey!  They did it to us when we were taking our NOCTI certification so they can shove it.  I filled up the tank today $13 for 6.9 gallons.  I'm glad I got the Saturn now. ;-) I get about 30 miles to the gallon.  I'm feeling another AudioBlog.  We will see tomorrow. ;-)
