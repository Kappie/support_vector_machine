Oh well can't have everything i guess. love you sqeet.  i have been writing lot of lyrics lately, most of which i am proud of these are my best two:  I will feel the air you breathe, it hits my neck ,and i am complete, Should i feel insecure? as i begin to roll across your floor,   i hate the way that you leave, it hurts my head, i cry in defeat, should I give you a clue? i should have told you i miss you    Am I home,  (am I home) cos this doesn't feel so right, Am I home, (am i home) cos this doesn't feel so right,    this is the time I will leave, take a look back, as I will retreat, do seconds mean so much? promise me that you'll keep in touch   This one made me believe, I second glance, as i press delete, why did it have to be you? its the rubbish thats always true,    Am I home,  (am I home) cos this doesn't feel so right, Am I home, (am i home) cos this doesn't feel so right, Am I home,  (am I home) cos this doesn't feel so right, Am I home, (am i home) cos this doesn't feel so right,  this doesn't feel right   and:  remember this, consider the fists, that you will make, that you create, while your heart beats way too fast, and now as your blood begins to boil, riddle me this, with one of your trists, questions you make,that you create, as I asked did you become undone, did you become,were you undone,   (if I'm in love don't bother asking) It's a long way to walk home, (if I'm in love don't bother asking) I'm glad I'm not walking with you,   popcorn in lobbies, do you have hobbies?  in your spare time, look at the time, is hurting me all you have to pass the time, or do other men spend time walking alone, fighting your hedges, hanging off ledges, killing off the time, look at the time, was this worth a damn as you look back, a you turn around, as you look back,   (if I'm in love don't bother asking) It's a long way to walk home, (if I'm in love don't bother asking) I'm glad I'm not walking with you,   you make me feel like the haze desended, (And as a thousand tongues would wag,) would it hurt for your life to be contended, (as a thousand tongues would wag,) you make me feel so bad its uncomprehended, (if I'm in love don't bother asking) you left me and this relationship unattended, (if I'm in love don't bother asking)   (if I'm in love don't bother asking) It's a long way to walk home, (if I'm in love don't bother asking) I'm glad I'm not walking with you,
