Up to my neck in water,  But I’m dry as a rock.  Apart from this world in so many ways,  I crave the water of fellowship, of belonging,  But still I go unquenched.   I know God is there, that He can help me,  But why isn’t that enough?  Is it that I seek the tangible?  Someone to love and confide in?  The deepest friendship one could have,  And maybe even more?   I that what I seek is what I have said,  But also understanding…  Can they comprehend me?  If I open myself up to them, will they scorn me still,  And drive me away as before?  Or upon understanding me, will they finally show me compassion and draw me in?  ‘Tis the uncertainty everyone faces, so why does it seem harder for me?
