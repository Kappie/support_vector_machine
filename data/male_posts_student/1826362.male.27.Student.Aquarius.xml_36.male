I was walking to school, and I saw something flitter through my field of vision and even though I wasn't really paying attention to it, somehow my subconcious was able to alert my concious that there was something good on the ground and I should go in for a closer look.  Ten one dollar bills folded together, two of them had blown a few feet away from the others, and I swooped down and pocketed them.  It was like the universe knew that I could really use ten dollars and made it appear in front of me.  I wonder if there is some sort of money uncertanty principle that causes cash to jump into and out of existence like particles in a vacuum.  If this money dissappeared from your pocket and reappeared in front of me on the sidewalk, I'm sorry, but you will have to adress all requests for refunds to: The Universe everywhere all space, and time 01801  so far I have purchased a toothbrush and a package of dental floss, both cvs brands, for $1.99 each.  I plan to put the other $6.02 to good use; I will not squander the universe's gift of cashola.
