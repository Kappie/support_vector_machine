My bf got himself a new car, and I thought: "great"... Now, I'm not that sure, I know is great for him, he deserves that car, and he is working hard for it ( well... kinda hard, nah, he does work hard ). So why am I not sure about it? Mmmh, it will sound a little bit too immature, well, hey it's me. At the beginning I thought it was jealousy because he has a great car, but in reality, I could care less what kind of car he uses, is the idea of him not needing me to come over his house to pick him up. As an example, today I went over there to buy some clothes, and I wanted him to come with me. He agreed, but I didn't have the need to pick him up or to drop him off at his house ( which would've bought me some time with him alone ), instead, he was there already waiting for me... We went in the store, pick the stuff, paid for it and leave... I returned home and he went his way, so I lost there almost 15 min of his company by the simple fact that he has a car now.  I might be a little childish, but now you know how I react to all this. Now I think I'll miss the nightly drive to his house ( he lives in another city ), go to the movies in my car, he driving it.  ... Today he did something that I didn't like at all. We were having lunch and I asked him: "who loves you?" ... He made a face, a movement, and said: "enough of it already" ... I know I shouldn't say it all the time, it might sound like I'm trying to validate our relationship all the time, but... I mean, is that bad a question?  I think he's growing distant... I know he cares for me... But he  IS  in fact kind of distant lately. If it were for me, I would be with him all day, I am able to hang out doing nothing at all... I don't think he can. Sometimes I feel he's not opening to me. Do I need to work on it or just give him space? The problem for me is that I sympathized easily, and I get depressed so fast and so strong. Ok, I won't ask it again, I'll just acknowledge he loves me and that's just it. ... Becky got in an accident, this hasn't been her week... She's been depressed and I think that sometimes she feels lonely... poor girl.
