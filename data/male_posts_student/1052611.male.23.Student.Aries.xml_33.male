Fews lines from "The Unforgiven"   they dedicate their lives to running all of his he tries to please them all this bitter man he is  throughout his life the same he's battled constantly this fight he cannot win  a tired man they see no longer cares the old man then prepares to die regretfully that old man here is me   I have not yet been able to find a fault in the old man.
