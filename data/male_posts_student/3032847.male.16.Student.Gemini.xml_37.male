I had photography lessons, chemistry, maths, physics and business studs. All went well. Good teacher people. Didn't notice any chores (or townies, or.. whatever you call 'em). After college.. after tea... after half 7PM I decided I needed to get out. I went on a bike ride, the usual route around the 'Hart to Haswell walkway', which is along the route of an abandoned train track. But, I decided to go all over the place, having a look around wingate and nesbitt hall... and then I went totally off route across a field, and ended up in castle eden dene. Next to Castle Eden... Castle! I haven't been there since me and me mam nd dad used to walk the old dog there, before it died.. when I was like 10 :-O The old place is all done up! No longer a ruin! Well, I got a bit lost, ended up in Horden. Still lost as I've never been in Horden Colliery in my life, I ended up on the beach, miles and miles from home. No phone, dark. Shit. Somehow I peddled like mad and got to blackhall where I was nearly attacked by a bunch of low life wankers, and then I ended up at me grandads where I finished the day off with a big plate of lamb and chips, 'n gravy :-)   Today was, ... I d'no. I feel a bit strange :-S Had maths and physics. Then 'BLOCK F' on the form thing, I was going to do sailing but I ended up staying at the college and following everyone else.. who ended up doing the 'treasure hunt'. All this was was working out clues and going about the college getting different peoples signatures. All very well, but as usual everyone abandoned me and Dave, who's a good mate in a wheelchair. Everyone ALWAYS does it. This time it was Les (Name  Shame- DANIEL FOTHERGILL).. 'here ya go jonny stay with dave *runs off* (whole place suddenly deserted). And one time in particular, on the bus back from Seaton- everyone 'Jonny you take Dave, go on Jonny you get off the bus god Jonny just go, we're going to Ryans'. I'll admit that was a while ago, but nowts changed. I don't mind stayin with dave- at all, its just peoples attitudes. They don't have to get off the bus and they get rid of me- two birds with one stone eh- wasn't it? Come on... what the fucks wrong with everyone? So.. I never got to see the upstairs of the college in the 3 full induction days. The place is like 150 years old or something, and there are no lifts, so couldnt take Dave. At least Grace stayed with us for a while when we found her. Good girl, Grace :-D  My neighbour, over the road was in the Hartlepool Mail again today! This time, on his horse, in a knight outfit thing- even the horse was dressed up. It was about the village fete on Saturday. Fred's a good laugh. And a good bloke. Is in the lifeboat crew and everything! After reading that I looked up to see Fred, and two other neighbours outside with a BIG rainbow trout. Greg  Gary had caught it out fishing.. 16.5lb or something. Impressive. They were pictured for some fishing magazine, and Tom from the Mail is taking some pics in the morning before its put to good use! I'll put sum pics up when I start uploading them..!  It's the prom tomorrow night. Any locals will know where I mean when I say it's at Hardwick Hall. I was going to get there in a limo along with Anto, Ryan, Dan and all them. Turns out I was 'replaced' with some other people.. but never mind. Won't have to see some of those people again after this.. but- that's a shame :-( So, I'm going with Dave, Kat and Sarah and.. some other people lol. Good people. Most the lads seem to be wearing a tux. Oh well, too late now. I'll wear my normal suit.. cheaper though eh? And before you wonder, I'm not 'going' with anyone. Hey I tell ya.. I'm just looking foreward to a good meal! I'm looking foreward to my next post..........
