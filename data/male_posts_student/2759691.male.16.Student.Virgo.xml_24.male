Additionally, subscribing customers will get two free DVD rentals the old fashioned way. Customers can have upto three DVDs at a time with no late fees and no due dates for $20 a month. The move comes after the success of internet DVD rental store Netflix, which offers the service for $22 a month. Although Netflix claims it is superior because of its next-day home delivery, it will be interesting to see now Blockbuster's "world's largest DVD rental service" status affects its new online venture. The service is certainly a savings opportunity for those who rent frequently, otherwise it may be better to just drive to the store. Both Netflix and Blockbuster are offering free trials of their service.
