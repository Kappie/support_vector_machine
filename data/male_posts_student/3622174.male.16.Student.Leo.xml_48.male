Your goal in this game is to form as many words as possible out of your set of letters (which is like 25, I think), including that WHAT Word(s), which have to be done in order for you to move on to the next round.    The game has a nice interface.  Its a green background, with the words you've found on the right, the WHAT Words you need to find below it, and the actual letter on the left.  It is so easy to use, and so much fun, too.  You can move any letter anywhere you want, so it's not like that classic 90s game Boggle, where you can only move something to the left, right, above, or below where it is now.  So, it makes the game a little bit easier, until you start forming words that you don't mean to.  But even then, it makes it even more fun because you are scrambling to get the same letters so you can form your WHAT Word.  On the negative side, there is one little problem, and that is time.  They give you too much of it.  They should narrow down the time just a little bit, because it makes the game incredibly easy, and we don't want too much of that.   urlLink    What Word? is a highly addicting game in which you can move letters around to form words. You have to form the WHAT Word(s) before you can move on though! urlLink     Overall, this is my favorite web game that I have reviewed so far, even better than ZUMA, which still holds the record as the best game.  I'm proud to give this game the score it receives.   Pros  +Nice interface +Easy to Play +Addicting!   Cons  -Too much time given to form the WHAT words.    Score  Fun Factor: 100% Graphics/Layout: 100% Speed: 98% Customization/Controls: 98% Final: 99%-A GOLD!
