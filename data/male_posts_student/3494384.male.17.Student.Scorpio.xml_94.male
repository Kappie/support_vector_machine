She couldnt hire any taxi and she was already late for the test. I reach school at 9.10 am. Test start at 9.30 am. She arrived at 10+.  No need to take le. Sure go in kena kick out de. Went eating with Cecily's and her friends. After that, Jasmine invited us to study with her and her boyfriend. Went alone. Cecily's got to meet more friends.  Jasmine's boyfriend seems to dont like me much. I wonder why. Maybe he think I'm gonna snatch Jasmine away? I really can feel that he doesnt like me that much.  I called Victor. Study study study. All of them are studying. I've got no mood. Too tired le. Lie on the bench and then I fall asleep. What the hell. I slept for 1 hour. I did told you people that I slept 2 hours the night before, didnt I.  Didnt touch much of C Maths. Touched the very very basic only.  The test was easy. Easy for others but not for me. I can see that the questions are easy. But then due to my laziness, I can only barely pass the exam. Maybe borderline fail.  Better than IISO, ZERO.  Went eating desert with Daniel at Tampines Mall again and saw one of our ex-teacher, Mr Yuan. What a shit face.  Might go sleep soon. What about my NMM? Hiaz...  Donkey, I miss you alot. How you doing now? Hiaz...
