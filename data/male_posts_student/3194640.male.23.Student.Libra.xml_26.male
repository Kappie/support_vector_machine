My car shouldn't blow up any time soon (if it's not provoked).   My day seemed pretty normal, but then something bizarre happened...   As I was drving home from running a few errands earlier today, I saw a peacock on the side of the road. Yes, I said a    PEACOCK   , as in the bird with the huge tail of feathers. I wish I had had my camera with me. It was weird. I guess someone lost it or it had escaped from someone's backyard. That would not surprise me, because I was driving in the nice part of town. Even so, you don't drive through the city of Wichita and expect to see a peacock outside of the zoo wandering along the side of the road like a lost dog. It just doesn't happen. I'm still trying to figure out why someone would have a peacock.    urlLink    Archive Photo: Sr. Benicio's peacock, not the one I saw today. Benicio was a guy I met in Brazil. His family had a peacock (Don't ask me why they had one, because I don't know). urlLink     For the few of you who do read this, I did stop my car and try to do something about it. I was going to try to return it to its owner(s) but when it saw me it ran into the bushes and trees on the side road and disappeared. I must have looked like an idiot searching for that elusive peacock. I didn't see it again. When I realized that I probably wouldn't find it, I got back into my car and drove away. The end.
