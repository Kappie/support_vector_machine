Many thanks to the juniors who were already on the parade ground when I was pondering if I should scale the walls or climb the side gate cos the primary school shut the main gate in our faces when we were about to drive into the sch compound(the fuckers!!!!).Actually I took the long way,I went one round to get in via the secondary sch,its just too scary after listening to Maria Koh.Also,thanks go out to the sec 3s and CLTs who planned the event.  We didn't have much of a rehearsal so we messed up the parade.We got dogtags for our POP,cool.I love them,they spelt my surname right.The last part was all a blur,bangs and shouts and furry blue berets in the sky.The next thing I know,I was heading mechanically towards my camera.  We went out for dinner @ Takashimaya.We wanted to dine @ Seoul Garden but it was full so we went to the LEGO shop while waiting for seats.  Derrick: haha,we are looking at Lego. ChienHan a.k.a C.H.YU:  shaddup la,if you think Lego is childish then you are immature.  In the end the last supper was taken on a flight of steps between 2 escalators,we had KFC.  Then we played LAN untill 11pm and went home.Sigh...   au revoir compagnon m' d armes!!!
