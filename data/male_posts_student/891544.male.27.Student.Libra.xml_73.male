Good luck though, I'm sure it's going to be great.  So Sonia and Jackie, do you guys have plans for tonight too?  I'm about to go to Lamesa to have lunch with my mother, so give me a call in a little bit and we can chat.  Actually, call Cyndi or Chris to get my number, I don't think that you have it, and I really don't want to put my phone number on the internet.  No mas prank calls for Peanut!  I hope everyone is having a good day!  I'll talk to you guys later.  Good luck again, Chris.  ~P
