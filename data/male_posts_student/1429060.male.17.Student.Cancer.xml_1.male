Alanna is angry-but-not-in-an-explosive-way at me for betraying the DOY code of never removing posts. Here is the dangerous poem that could strip your eyes of the retina if you read it too closely.    Unconsciously   Voice so tiny in the receiving end of a telephone Or binary code words slapped onto the white screen I can talk to you over a distance of wire and metal And I can know what you think You can tell me that you are writing or dancing To a selection of rock music that rolls through the speakers.  I just feel it can be so false When your eyes are not there, then, to assure me Of what you are thinking And how you breathe when you hear the telltale noise Or a shadow that moves in the living room.  It is then, fully awake That you are entirely conscious of what you want to think And thinking is not unconscious Realized as each thought forms gently Upon the breeze of memory and mind You dress as you feel your ideas And spontaneously call me up for a spin.  Insomnia, as defined by old Webster Chronic inability to fall asleep or remain so I find that you are the most random over the wires When you can’t fall into a dream But the dragging effect of fatigue pulls at your eyelids And you run tot he kitchen for a wake-up call.  Spontaneous, I say again A chain of random thought that ties itself in your mind Tired as it may be And we can speak, oddly, of blueberries and Monaco At the same time, with no transition.  I think you are lovely upon awakening Sounds odd, I understand But your voice is groggy over the phone wires And in that moment you can be undisturbed by life’s pain It is that carelessness that allows you to giggle From fatigue or wake dancing to the radio beats.  Sleep is a funny thing As I need my share, and you need yours We both despise the bloody activity Unconscious for several hours, laying sprawled in bed I hate just drifting off But I enjoy the effects of waking on your voice And your eyelids, when closed, are beautiful.   This is written to a "you", but I shan't state whom. It broke something of the fluidity on the DOY site; thusly, I deleted it. I did not like it posted. Odd feeling, but it has been eating at me all day.  Saw a movie entitled  The Royal Tenenbaums . Beautiful movie, really random, and from there comes the genius of it. Richard Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson) and Margot Tenenbaum (Gwyneth Paltrow) are my two personal favorites: Richard, a tennis-playing suicidal hippie, and Margot, a smoking depressed adopted child, who turn out to love each other secretly. Lovely movie. Get it when you can.  I am currently reading  The Grapes of Wrath  for AP English class. It is a hell of a book, and it is hell in itself. Not very exciting, from what I have read thus far. But I shall triumph eventually.  Yoga class was cancelled. My first class. Unhappiness.  Cheers, humans.
