I'm sorry if you ever thought I was putting down "punk." Truly, through my whole life, it's carried with it a negative connotation. Now, it's a loaded word, one I won't use to myself in the dark of night. My apologies.  I tried to look up this Nazi war crimes/Vatican connection, but I'm just confused. Certainly, there was some help from the Catholic church to the Nazis. Hitler was a self-proclaimed Catholic, and numbers of extremely radical Catholics, i.e. Fr. Coughlin, were in the same field as he, surely including bishops and others present in the Vatican. This is not to mention that Italy was under Nazi control at the time and all present were under great duress. This does not connect all of the church and the heirarchy of the Pope directly to the Nazi cause, however. If you could, I'd enjoy a look at your sources so I can discern a bit for myself.  I don't hate Fundamentalists, or anyone for that matter. But their point of view is not my own.  As a matter of fact, Catholic canon prohibits use of birth control outside of Natural Family Planning, as stated in Pope Paul VI's  Humanae Vitae , published in the early 60s to great uproar. Sex can happen without birth control; it's this culture that says it cannot. The Catholic view of the family provides for two equal and primary functions thereof; love and procreation, along with duties of education and morality associated with offspring. Both these are present in sexual intercourse, at least that which is without perversion thereof. Sex without babies (birth control, abortion) is wrong, as is babies without sex (in-vitro fertilization, cloning). The only "birth control" allowed is NFP, which leaves the act fully intact without addition of barriers or drugs, but also provides for the need of a family to not bring into the world another child, which may burden the family financially or otherwise.  This radio thing sounds like fun, but I'm not sure how it would work to broadcast if we're in school all day.  Sorry if I missed anything, please post here for any questions. I hope to be back Monday.  God bless.
