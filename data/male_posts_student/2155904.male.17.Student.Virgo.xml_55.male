Then we went to Best Buy and got some stuff there.  Then we went to Burger King but we had to turn around and we ended up in this dealership back lot place and Skippy tried to get some air off this little lip and smacked his car on the ground!  IT WAS SICK!  Hella sweet.  Later on they all met up at Skippy's and played a little Halo and Fever before going bowling.  Tyke, Skippy, Karla, Dudely, and Amed all came.  Amed had to leave in the 4th frame cuz his pops made him cuz of the snow.  The rest all stayed though.  Tyke drove and they decided to hit up JIB on the way home cuz it was right next to the bowling alley.  So right when Tyke hit snow he lost complete control of the car.  He was like, "This is gonna be a long drive home."  And it was.  They got on the main road and the freeway and he had control there.  Then he got up closer to Lakemont (one of the back routes...not Lakemont Boulevard) and two of the hills his 92 Volvo beast had some problems with.  Skippy and Dudely helped push the car up while Tyke was doing his best to command his car up the hill.  They got it up both but not before burning a lot of rubber and Skippy and Dudely getting quite wet.  Then when Tyke got closer to Skippy's he lost complete control of the car and that was sick.  He almost jumped the sidewalk but he got control of the brakes just in time to stop it.  It was quite an experience.  All the kids knew they couldn't get home so they just spent the night at Skippy's.  It was cool.  A fun time.  Then Tyke left at like 12 and came home and stuff.  It felt great to shower.  Now he is bored a little and is not really looking forward to tonight because it will probably suck since nobody is free.  And if they are free then it will be like a 3 person party.  Yippee! :/
