If this poem does not make sense, Go shout, and tell your 'rents. Afterall, I must have made the decision, To post this poem that will mess up your vision.  In the end, is it really a blog worthy poem? Or am I just wasting your time that I decided to "Show 'em"? That is the question in hindsight, Because I was not right!
