People race to embrace carnal and base pleasures, when those are the dreams of brute beasts. What separates most people from dogs? Not much that I can tell. Both seem to be after a full stomach, a warm place to sleep, and approval in society. Though I myself seek many of these things, I realize that there is much more to the human condition than these simple desires.   I think freedom is the highest ideal and the best possible state for a sentient being to live in. But so few people understand or desire it. They go through life merely existing, seeking the path of least resistance. They do what they are told, or what is expected of them. I think sheep do the same thing. Those who seek the truth, who follow their dreams over the horizon are despised by these "sheep" because their strength illustrates the sheep's weakness.   I want to be free. Free of control by others. Free of the compulsion to labor for someone else. I want to own myself. I will not do what anyone else wants me to do! I will do what I want to do! This isn't mere rebelliousness, or the angry ranting of some child. So many people are unhappy because they are slaves. Slaves to their lives, to the place they occupy in the machinery of Society. They are prisoners of their minds. Religion, family, politics, marriages, children - all these things can hold us hostage as surely as a terrorist. I refuse to let such things hold sway over me!   I define my own reality. This very moment, the second you are reading this is the only one that matters. All that came before or might come is nothing but an illusion. So make your own reality! Stop being a slave to the past, or to some illusory future. My life before now was nothing. It doesn't exist. It's only purpose was to set me where I am now. What I do from here is my own choice.   I do not know what profession I want to pursue. I do not know what I will be doing in five or ten years. But I will always seek what it is that I want. I will remain free to make my own choices. I will be open to radical shifts in lifestyle, purpose, and thought. Past positions, successes, failures all mean nothing when I choose what to do now.   I admire the writers of the US Constitution because they sought to set men free. Since perfect freedom is not possible, they had to form a system that restricts the ability of men to enslave one another and allows them to choose their own way of life. There is no freedom without the law! I embrace the need for laws, for order in the universe. I cannot be free unless there are boundaries for my behavior. I accept these boundaries. In an ideal world, every person who reaches voting age would have to accept or deny the authority of government. An oath of fealty, separating those who enter willingly into a social compact with one another from those who do not care to be free.   Of course, those men that formed the most perfect government yet seen were also highly educated. They studied the lessons of the past, and considered the trials of the future. Those who seek to discard the experience of the past in favor of untried theories should be prepared to retreat back to the established truths when their ideas fail. I oppose the leftists concepts of handouts and equality because those ideas have been proven to enslave us. Gifts make a slave of those who accept the gifts. That which is not earned is resented. An imposition of equality destroys the desire to improve one's condition. Since society is a group of individuals, this destruction of free will surely leads to the destruction of a society.   I believe the fundamental concept of the Constitution was to protect us from one another. The rule of the majority was to be constrained by the three branches, by the bicameral legislature, and by the competition over power by greedy men. I desire gridlock in government. In my ideal world, it would be weeks between noticing the Federal Government existed. It would be days at least for State government. I feel the only legitimate purposes of government are to protect our freedoms and our lives from outside threats. Note I say "outside." This means protecting us from other individuals and groups that seek to do us harm. This is not protecting us from our own mistakes! I want to be free to hurt myself, just as I want to be free to improve myself. One cannot exist without the other! When you begin to exert authority over someone's body, you own them! They become your chattel. And it is a truly terrible realization I have come to that the people around me think they have a right to own me.  The only control I want over others is to keep them from controlling me. Those that bombinate about things like "giving back" or "those more fortunate" only want to control me. I refuse to take from someone else that which they earned for themselves! It is morally wrong. It is the very definition of evil. Doing it collectively or authorizing some government entity to do it for you does not make it any different. You who would steal from others are the worst thing on this earth! Why not just kill them and steal their belongings? It would be more honest than seeking to make them your slaves. Own yourself! Own your choices and your life! Wealth, happiness, and possessions are not the purposes of life! Taking them from others will not fulfill your purpose! Only by finding your own path and living your life free of bondage to others will bring you true joy.  If you blame your unhappy state on others you are lying to yourself. Happiness is a transient state. But following your dreams, being an individual in control of your own choices is an eternal state of happiness. Failures and successes are events on any path. We impose on ourselves the constraints that prevent us from being happy. The prison is of our own making. It is a cell with walls between our ears. Taking from others will not set us free. Converting others to our beliefs will not set them free. Bringing low those who are exalted and raising up those who are despised will not free us. Only a knowledge and understanding of true liberty can free us from ourselves.   I seek to be free. I seek a higher state of being. My life will be my own. No man will own me! I do realize that it is merely a dream. It cannot be realized in this world I find myself in. But that does not discourage me from the pursuit of my ideal! The darkness does not diminish the light. I know now what it is I want. I know what state I desire for myself. No matter what others do or say or impose on me, I will persist in my dream of freedom. I will refuse to rule over others, though they might wish it on themselves. I will refuse to allow my mind to be ruled over by those who seek lordship over me. My body cannot be free of the shackles that those who are stronger than me seek to impose. Taxation is an evil that I cannot escape. Collective serfdom is a shackle I cannot throw off. But my mind is free! Though I be taxed to fund those who enslave me, I will never willingly submit to it. To throw off that shackle would be only to invite a more restrictive set of shackles. So I endure my bondage.  I leave you with the thought that true freedom is the most perfect state of existence. When we can own ourselves and no one else, then we can be said to be free. Then we can be happy.
