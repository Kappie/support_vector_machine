To the two Yale Law students who came up to me after the show and said they read this and like it: thanks -- you made my day.  To any of my fellow cast members who happen to read this: awesome job -- working on the show was an awful lot of fun, and I think we had an enormously talented cast and crew, and, more important, a cast and crew made up of awesome, cool, good people.  I will miss spending the bulk of my 6:00-midnight hours standing in a dark corner, waiting for a light cue.  Well, maybe not.  To the random unidentified e-mailer who wrote at 6:55 last night inquiring about what time the Parody starts (7:00): sorry -- hope you figured it out.
