'Nobody but you'.. omg, it's amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love it so much. i listened to it till like 3 in the morning lol. now i'm plannin to make a pv for it. the lyrics speak to me..  motto mitsumete .. Nobody but you.. wow O.O  i went to the city today (new york city), to get my hair styled like Minwoo's. i love it lol. and i got more sushi. i ate sum shrimp and spicy tempura sushi and took sum home with me. my mom got her hair done too coz we gonna leave to go to peru in a lil over a week. we got home at like 7 and i was sad coz i missed a lot of chat time with melissa.  and today i'm still stuck on 'Nobody but you'. i dl-ed 'Dreams Come True (Jap)' and a radio ripped version of 'Konoyono Shirushi'. i liked em both but i still went back to Nby. it's just so addictive.   Song(s) Of The Day:   BoA* - Nobody but you (Japanese Version)
