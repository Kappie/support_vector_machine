These cameras actually have film though, so if I was to post any pictures it would involve scanning.   So I guess I'll be doing alot of scanning.  Actually, I don't think I've used an actual camera that you have to put the film in before. Only those Kodak throw-aways...  urlLink  ten golden rules of lomography
