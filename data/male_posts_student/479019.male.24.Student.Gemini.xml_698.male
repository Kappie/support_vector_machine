However, in my honest opinion those reviews were no doubt tainted by sympathy for a fallen legend.  Streetcore  is by no means a bad album; however, it falls short of the magic of  Global A Go-Go . That album was solid from top to bottom.  Streetcore , unfortunately, has a few weak tracks sandwiched between great songs. This could be due to the fact that Strummer died before the album was finalized. Songs such as “Long Shadow,” “Arms Aloft,” and “All in a Day” really don’t do much for me. Those songs are luckily sandwiched between great songs such as “Coma Girl,” “Get Down Moses,” a great cover of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song,” and “Silver and Gold” (a song that was meant to be a gift to the late Johnny Cash). All in all I see  Streetcore  as average compared to the greatness of  Global A Go-Go , but worth getting for some of the aforementioned tracks.  ***
