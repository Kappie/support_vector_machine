Only Keegan managed to save us from a terrible death and prevent Spurs from getting a clean sheet.My debut was a lil ok,playing in defence in the first half and in midfield in the second.I must say that playing in midfield is more suited to my style.But like what Yanni text messaged me,she is sure that we can do it better.I also got my fave no. that is 6!.same as woody i noe but bowyer is my fave.but woody is too.incidentally,bowyer(my fave) and given(Yanni)got the eye infection.damn!Nani also mesaged me saying that she cannot do so anymore.i dunno how long its gonna take but the feeling of deja vu looms again and i dun wanna want it happen again.Looks like its better to stay single.I just hope things take a better turn next time round.....
