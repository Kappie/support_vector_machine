I thought he would at least e-mail or something.  Or maybe update his journal.  But nothing.  And I don't know what's going on.  What to do.  Sigh.  Is he going to dissappear?  To just leave me?  It sounds like a beginning of an emo song.  A really gay one.  Other than that, Target sent home a card saying that they have reviewed my application and will contact me when they need me.  Meaning that there's no more spots open, I guess.  All of my old bosses have moved on so I don't have any high contacts anymore.  I applied at Old Navy too.  I finally got my application for the volunteer position at Suburban hospital.  Shrug.  Yesterday was the first day that I had ever mowed my lawn.  It wasn't that hard.  Especially with the tractor.  It was kinda fun.  It was more fun because my parents weren't home.  No one was home except for me.  And I liked it that way.  I am definately not going to stay home for college.  No way.  Temple seems like a nice place.  Populated.  I want to do something with other people.  I'm sick at staying at home.  And I had hoped I could do something with Matt.  Just one more week that he's supposed to be here.  Maybe I won't see him ever again.  Or hear from him ever again.  Right now, it really doesn't matter.  I had good memories.  I wanted more memories.  But I guess I can't ask for too much.   What should I do?  What is my next step?  Will someone please comfort me?
