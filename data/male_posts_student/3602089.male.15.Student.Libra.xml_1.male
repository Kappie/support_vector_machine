On "The Green" they have many tents full of people selling neat trinkets, hand-carved woodwork, lawn-decorating pieces, tye-dyed clothes, and hundreds of other unique products.  I bought two dollars worth of marbles which appealed to me...especially the orange and white ones that look like cream/dreamsicles.  In the north section of "The Green" are approximately fifteen food stands; They have everything you can imagine...german bratwurst, greek gyros, candy apples, mongolian noodles, old-fashioned orangeade, bloomin' onions, sausage, meatballs, cheesesteak, pie, pierogies, cheesecake, chicken sandwiches, and other exotic food stands.  This was the list of my "gastric-hoardings" from today in order of first to last eaten from 1pm to 5pm...  1.)  Old-Fashioned Lemonade 2.)  Half of a funnelcake 3.)  A huge strawberry shortcake (real strawberries, real biscuits, and really       rich, buttery, whipped topping) 4.)  Greek potato salad - perfectly cooked warm-ish olive-oiled potatos with       leaves/flakes of parsley and pepper 5.)  Old-Fashioned Lemonade  I am kicking myself now because I decided against buying some oriental mongolian noodles for fear of barfing near the "marble tent".  I will just have to wait until next year.  As I listen to the news they are talking about "Bill Clinton's Autobiography: My Life"...haha...what a freaker...And for DINNER (7:30pm), dad made a delicious bbq chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese, garlic, and romaine, all on a plain flour bun...
