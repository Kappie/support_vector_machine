"Iran has issued an extraordinary list of demands to Britain and other European countries, telling them to provide advanced nuclear technology, conventional weapons and a security guarantee against nuclear attack by Israel."   While there is no evidence that Britain would ever comply with the Iranian demands, it does say something about the Iranian assessment of European resolve that they would even put such a demand on the table.  As this issue moves along, do we really want to let Other Countries deal with the Iranians on the nuclear issue?  Will the Europeans, no friends to Israel, stand firm against Iranian proliferation?  And would this ever rise to the level of unilateral intervention in a Kerry administration?  UPDATE - Some interesting analysis of this story over at  urlLink Captain's Quarters .
