Well, today the Supreme Court ruled that the guy didn't have the legal standing to pursue his fight against America. Just  kidding . In fact, the Court didn't  actually  rule on the case itself but rather on the dad's ability to take action. So that's a  "non-story" .  Where in the world did this guy found the idea that he had the ability to change a nation's tradition anyway?   urlLink CNN.com: Supreme Court Dismisses 'Pledge' Case
