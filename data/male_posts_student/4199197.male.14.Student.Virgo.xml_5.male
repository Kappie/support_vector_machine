When my school hosted all the possible democratic nominees these really sketchy looking guys with german accents and unibrows would hand out these hilarious pamphlets entitled 'Return of the beast man' featuring Dick Cheney. They must have been mentally ill or unable to understand english, because what was written in those books was basically a poorly done political satire.  Also, when the nominee wannabes had open questions, one of the questions was always 'Why wont you debate Larouche?" Those guys got taken away by security it was the shit.
