Not only am I playing the game to recieve over fifty awards, Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, but also Halo. For the GameCube, I've been playing Custom Robo. My favorite combination of parts is the Javelin (a Strike Vanisher model), the Shotgun part, the Wave Bomb part, the Aerial Freeze pod, and Booster legs. Of course, if I get the chance, I am so gonna put the Rahu III gun on him, the Shotgun is way too short-range. Along with all of these, I am revisiting one of my old favorites, Runescape. This game can, of course, be found at www.runescape.com. If you decide to play, or if you already play, my username is Hydra22. Talk to me if ya want. If ya don't, that's fine, you're probably not worthy to talk to someone of my calibur anyway.
