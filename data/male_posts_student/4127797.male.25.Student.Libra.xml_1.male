OK, you all know about Bush's economic policy failing to create jobs( urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/business/06CND-ECON.html?ex=1092888000&en=5336cf8a4f6027a7=5070hp ).  We all know that Bush's tax policy is shifting the tax burden on themiddle class ( urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5689001/ ) and that the gapbetween the haves and have nots has increased more under Bush( urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5726153/ ).  Oh yeah, Bush has been rolling back consumer, worker, environmental, andsafety regulations (say good by to all you worked for Mr. Nader):  urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/14/politics/14bush.html?pagewanted=printposition=   What else can Bush do wrong?  Oh yeah, education.  NCLB encourages charterschools.  But surprise, surprise, charter schools are performing at lowerlevels than traditional public schools: urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/17/education/17charter.html?hp
