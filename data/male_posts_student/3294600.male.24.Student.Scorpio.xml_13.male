I stopped at 12 AM and will hopefully finish it tomorrow.  I'm halfway done in a 200 page book.  I had Taco Time for dinner and it was pretty good.  They are really slow at making food.  I brought it home, chatted on-line as I ate, and then went back to reading after an hour or so break.  I'm going after classes tomorrow to take care of some more business regarding my Dad in Mount Vernon.  I'm going to talk to his attorney, pick up the death certificates (if I get up there in time), and try to get ahold of the guy that said he was going to buy my Dad's truck back.  After errands up north, I'm going to have dinner with my Uncle, Aunt, and Grandma.  Hopefully things will get figured out on what to do from here regarding school, living, Dad, etc.  Gosh what else is there to say?  Not a whole lot really.  Slow day for the most part.  No E-mail from Jackie's sister's friend. :P  Not that I'm anxious or anything.  Well I think I'm going to close for tonight.  I can't think of anything else right now.  Have a great week!
