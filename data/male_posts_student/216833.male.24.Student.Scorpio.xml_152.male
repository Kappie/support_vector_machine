I have to finish the laundry, wash my dog with flea killer, powder the carpet with flea killer just in case, plant some flowers I bought, and clean the bathroom. Oh yeah, wash the dishes and go get my library card. I have to go get more quarters here in a bit so I might get the libary thing knocked out then. I also bought a board so maybe when I am done with all that I can paint.  Mimi and I got half way up the mountain and had to turn back because it was getting dark. We started the hike later then planned but we still wanted to hike as far as we could. We got about 2.5 miles and turned back. It was still an awesome view but we will have to go back for sure. Maybe next time we will take our bikes up the fire road. We were the only ones out there until we saw this random lady walking down the mountain. She was dirt as fuck and had nothing on her. I would have to have some water for this mountain, at least. Maybe she lived in the park. :)  Well, I am off to tackle the "day off" list!  ttyl!!   current mood: busy current music: Danzig - She Rides
