He says, "Hey, I wonder if they have Magic cards." and I'm like, "Nah, I don't see anything and even so I don't think they'd sell 'em here. It's all electronic stuff." So he ignores me like he's prone to and goes up to the guy there and says, "Hey, do you have any Magic cards?" The guy goes, "Lemme check." and so he unlocks this cabinet and shuffles around for like, 5 seconds, and then pulls out 4 Onslaught boosters and an Onslaught deck. I'm all thinking, "Whoa, they actually have them!" and Mike's like "How much are they?" The guy's like "$1.99 per booster and 5 something for the deck." We're both floored. I'm all digging in my pockets for cash and Mike's kinda laughing. We both grab 2 boosters each (I woulda bought the deck but I had no more money) and check them out. I got this rare land which I'm using in my next deck and I forget what Mike got but it was like  2 bucks for 15 cards? Whoa!  I'm deffinately looking up the nearest EB.
