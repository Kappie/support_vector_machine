Only by forcing ourselves to listen to criticism can we teach ourselves that it is sometimes well intended,  that we won't fall to pieces no matter what other people say about us.   Be quiet while you are being criticised  make clear that you are listening.  Look directly at the person talking to you.                                                         Only in this way can you convey open reception to what he is saying. Whether you agree with it or not is an issue to be discussed later on.  Under no condition find fault in the person who has just critcised you.       If he's made a mistake in grammar, wait half an hour b4 telling him. It will probably not seem that important to you then.  DOn't criticise the other person's reaction to your behaviour; for instance, by calling him oversensitive. His reaction is not the point.  Don't caricature the complaint.  Don't change the subject.  Use your intelligence to help articulate the objection, not to obscure it.  Don't imply that your critic has some ulterior, hostile motive for making his objection.                                                                                                        If you are asking why the other person has objected to your act, you are not dealing with his objection. The question about him should come later, if ever.  Convey to the other person that you understand his objection.   Paraphrasing it is one good way of doing this. You are sayin in effect that you have recieved the message  duly noted it.
