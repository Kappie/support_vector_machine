I dont want people to think Im weird asking someone out I have never met. But there is really no other way for me to meet her. No common activities or anything. I was thinking maybee just aranging to meet somewhere, like the park or something. Nothing big, maybe with some other people. Again, it would be  to get to know her . I was talking to Li today, he saw her at some class at the police station. He thinks she wouldent mind getting to know me better. I just hope hes right. Anyway, Im still waiting for her to get online. I dont want to call her two nights in a row, it might seem a bit obsessive. Post later.
