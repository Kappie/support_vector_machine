This month's site is:   urlLink Rotdrpg.com   Now I've got a lot to say and not much time or strength to say it because A) I'm feeling sick and can hardly breath and B) it's really late. Return of the Dragons Network features 4 spriters: MTP, Cez, Shadow Worm, and RedFox. Each of them have their own sprite comic: Cez has Super Cez's Adventure, MTP has Aftermath Chronicles, RedFox has Mobius Strip, and Shadow Worm has Alternative religion. Thank you, good night! Oh, and tune in next time for more...   SITE OF THE MONTH!!!
