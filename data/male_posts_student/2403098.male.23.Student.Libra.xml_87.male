Lauren decided that a good idea would be to come say hi to me, which WAS a good idea.  She was just in town for the evening on her way down to her Dad's place.  I was excited about the break from studying.  SHE was excited about the wine on my kitchen counter.  I was excited about it too.  Lauren suggested she have a glass.  The nerd in me told her no.  The cool kid finally got drug out, and before we knew it we were at my apartment complex's pool, feet hanging in the water, downing a bottle of wine and talking way too loudly about swatsticas (does anyone know how to spell that?  can't find it in the dictionary.  Anyway, just think "Nazi") and moving to foreign lands (Chicago and Minneapolis).  Don't ask where the Nazi symbolism comes in because it would be too hard to explain, and you wouldn't care anyway.    SO many laughs were had before I was told we were going to a bar next.  I didn't mind, because drinking is fun and after sharing a bottle of wine, no one says "no."  I'm not saying I got raped or anything, I just agreed to go to a bar.  More alcohol was consumed at The Library (bar and grill.. not book place).  Lauren got to steal another glass from there to complete her set of four, and I stole two glasses to complete my set of SIX.  They're great, they say "The Library Bar and Grill Norman Oklahoma"  I'm glad that I'll have those great glasses for whenever I move.  I will drink from them and say "ahhh, Norman, I used to live there."    It was a night of steals actually.  There's a wooden "Pool Closed" sign hanging in my laundry room right not actually.  You see, the pool was apparently closed when we went to drink our wine by it.  So, naturally, we jumped the fence, drank our wine by the pool anyway, and then took the damn "Pool Closed" sign on our way out.  I'd have taken a lawn chair, but they were heavy.  ANYwhoo.. the evening spilled over into today.  We downloaded some annoying music on the computer, sang along, etc.  Watched some TV for a while.  I got my haircut while Lauren wandered around Campus Corner going in and out of shops and mysteriously walking by the windows of the hair-cutting-place I was in.. eyeing me suspiciously and making me laugh.  OH OH, we ate pizza too.  FANTASTIC pizza at Hideaway.  After a couple of hours in the Campus Corner area, we came back to to my apartment to visit for a bit.  I began to inform Lauren of the things I'm learning in my Consumer Behavior book about sub-cultures and whatnot.  You know, Jews are rich apparently, gays can't get married and therefore financial services related to couples are important to them, whites like picnics and credit cards, and only half of the Arabs in the United States are muslim.  Who'da'thunk it?  All very useful.  Someday someone will ask me SOMETHING about this shit in a game of Trivial Pursuit.  "I KNOW I KNOW- ARABS!" I'll yell, and then receive a piece of the plastic pie.  You know, come to think of it, lauren came over yesterday to give me a magnet she purchased for me in Minneapolis.  She just left, after about 22 hours, and I still never got my magnet.  Oh well.  HOPEFULLY that means there will be another excuse to spend such a good time together in the future.  The code for "lets spend a good time together" will be: "hey, why don't you.. bring over that magnet."    Well, back to studying.  I took a 15 minute break so that I could write a little somethin-somethin.
