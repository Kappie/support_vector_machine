So instead, I repierced my lip! Looks pretty cool even if I do say so myself.  Right now, I am waiting until around 5.00am (which gives me 4 hours and 40 minutes) because I'm going out to a huge nature park type place called Styal with Buffon. The reason for it? I wanna take some really amazing photographs. They have so much cool stuff there, like waterfalls and really cool scenery. So I can't wait to get going, even though it's a 40 minute walk or something.  You'll have to excuse me if there are any grammar mistakes in here, I only got 2 hours sleep last night and it looks like I won't get any tonight. Which gives me an idea. Starting Monday, I am not going to sleep for a whole week, and I'm gonna write a report on it every night in here to see what kinda stuff happens to my mind. I remember when I went 3 days without sleep and I started hallucinating. So yeah, 7 days will be pretty freaky. Anyway, I'm gonna go and think of something to do for the next 5 hours...
