In his mad hurry to settle scores with Jayalalitha, Karunanidhi is acting in a irresponsible manner and it doesnt speak well of him. This is not the way to extract what u want. Also it seems to suggest that there are two power centres in the government what with Mr.Dayanidhi Maran announcing that" Sonia's Intervention" was the key. This suggests that ManMohan Singh wasnt keen on giving this to DMK but Sonia overruled him. Also this wasnt the way DMK behaved with NDA. It was a willing follower and it never arm twisted Vajapayee.May be that was bcoz of his towering image and that anyone in Congress lacks them. Already things are moving that way with Musharaff inviting Sonia to Pakistan.Is pakistan playing games with India?. He hasnt Invited PM but the leader of the party heading the government. This may also be to drive a wedge between the party and the Govt. The PM should not give in to these gimmicks and see to that govt functions smoothly.
