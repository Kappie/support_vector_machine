Though everybody is walking around saying ‘nice weather, be a heat wave soon’, mainly because between the last time it was this hot and now we have had all the bad weather under the sun for about 7 months.  But life must go on despite the heat, and this past few weeks I have been sitting my AS level exams I’ve had eight in total for four subjects, and my last exam was yesterday for economics. Now, normally (as has been the case for every other year of exams) I would have been revising heavily every night or so. Not this year, I’ve done in total about 6 hours worth, which sounds a lot but it isn’t when you imagine me doing it at midnight or watching the TV. So I have no idea what my grades are going to be like but I fear I will disappoint myself and my family.  I have had a lot on as well as school. I recently got a new job in a clothing store called River Island and they have been giving me a lot more hours a week, then there is being with Martin which I love doing, and that takes up most of time and I wouldn’t have it any other way. But the bad things are that I haven’t been out for a drink months, I haven’t had time to go swimming or to the beach or doing anything summery, I’m always busy or skint (poor).  So, it looks like I’m will be bringing in more money, I will just be too busy and too tired to spend it on anything worthwhile. All I want to do after work or at the weekend is to jump into a big cool pool, but I have to walk somewhere because getting the bus will be a waste of money, and the sun gets hotter, and I get more annoyed,  so the sun does indeed jest. Summer fun!
