We went skating on the canal in Ottawa today afternoon. The only other time I'd been skating was a few years ago. Steph pulled me around for the first little while, which was fun but rather passive and strained my back. Then Sue tried supporting me as I attempted to propel myself but that didn't work too well as I only had support on one side. So I tried again with with Prish  Sue each holding one of my hands, which worked somewhat better; enough to get me to the point where I could try skating on my own. I had a lot of trouble with my balance, although by the end I was able to skate in short bursts, albeit in a rather crude manner. It was a very tiring experience for me, since I was putting enormous effort into moving forward while staying on my feet. 
 
The drive into Montreal was fairly straightforward, although we got lost after missing a turnoff just a few blocks from Alex Somma's house on the South shore. I got directions from some random Francophones in a gas station dep and we eventually made it to Somma's place, only to discover that he wasn't home! Prish  Sue were tired  hungry by this point so I tracked Jer down instead  arranged to hang out with him instead. Then we went to  urlLink the hostel where Prish  Sue are staying  to check them in, followed by a hearty dinner - I had bifteck - at Nickels, which has fantastic broccoli. 
 
Once we'd eaten, the girls dropped me off at the apt. where Jer's friends Chris  Esther live. Two other friends,  urlLink Julie  Jaime  were there too. It was absolutely wonderful to meet some of the people about whom I have heard Jer tell stories. I discovered that Julie knows Alex Somma, Andrew Jones  Shannon Headland from high school! It was a lot of fun hanging out with them, although we could only stay so long as Jer needed to be up at 6am in the morning.
