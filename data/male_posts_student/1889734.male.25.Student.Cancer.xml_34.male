I guess not to the standard media.  The implications of this arrest are quite wide reaching.  I know we can't draw conclusions from one person, so I will wait to find out more before I react.  My only comment here is about the media quietly shuffling it to the back page.  I had to dig pretty deep to find this on CNN, and it is only a few days old.
