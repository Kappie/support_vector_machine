I worked and now am 110 dollars richer, muahahahah. At one point, Alex helped me tie metal bands around a large piece of insulation.  It was like I was the Hulk, ahah.  We moved lots of heavy things like that and stoves today.  Yesterday, volunteering was pretty simple stuff.  And I watched Dawn of the Dead, but I already said that.  Maybe today I'll be with Ashley.  :)
