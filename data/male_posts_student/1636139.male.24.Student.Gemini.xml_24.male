Had a water-pistol fight with my cousin Lorraine  her (unrelated to me) cousin Kyle. Spent the rest of the weekend at my uncle's place in Fremont, managing to spin a lot of cycles in a less than completely successful attempt at setting him up with a triple-boot system; damn shortsighted BIOS manufacturers...
  
Went to a farmer's market, where they had cheap avacadoes; still not as cheap as Ottawa though! My aunt cooked dinner  even gave me some to take home. Nothing quite like home-cooked food :-)
