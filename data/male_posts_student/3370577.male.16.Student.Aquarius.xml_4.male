Prince is fast, agile, and strong, and his amazing arsenal of moves and attacks are at your disposal. The game opens to the Persian army laying siege to the city of the Maharaja. After entering the city and reducing it to ruins, the Prince sets out on his own to retrieve a prize worthy of his father’s admiration. After deftly disposing of several guards and scaling pillars and walls, you come across the Dagger of Time, which allows Prince to control the flow of time itself.   Prince unintentionally brings about the downfall of a kingdom with this weapon, releasing the Sands of Time to consume the entire palace, mutating its inhabitants into monstrous creatures that feed on hate and violence. Prince, seemingly alone, must defeat them all and return the kingdom to its former glory.   Throughout the game, Prince receives new powers to aid him in his quest to right his wrongdoing. Among these powers are the abilities to slow, rewind, and completely freeze time. These abilities are not only fun to use, but very original. Should you take a nasty hit during a battle, you can simply rewind time and watch as Prince flies up from the ground, his health restored. Battles are fluid and entertaining and require real strategy to win. Sometimes faced with overwhelming odds, Prince can divide his attacks to deliver blow after crushing blow to his surrounding enemies, eventually ending their suffering with the Dagger of Time, which absorbs the Sands of Time that created them.   The graphics are simply amazing. In all honesty, they’re some of the best visuals I’ve ever seen. Everything seems to glow in this game, giving you a very surreal feeling. The phenomenal graphics coupled with the nearly flawless camera make this a video game experience that should not be missed.  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an amazing game. The perfect balance of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving will keep a gamer entertained for hours upon hours. Do not miss this one, folks.
