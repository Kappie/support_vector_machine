So, ignoring this odd little winter term we've got in January where we take one class for three hours a day for three weeks, I'm halfway done with law school. Weird.  Seems like I just started.  I'll come up with some sort of gimmick to note the halfway mark -- advice, or a top ten list, or something -- but nothing's come to mind yet.  Brain kind of fried from 3 eight-hour exams in the past 4 days.  In the meantime, you can check out the NY Times Magazine's  urlLink Year In Ideas , like I'm about to do.  Or wait twenty minutes and I'll tell you whether it's worth reading or not.  EDITED TO ADD: I'm about a third of the way through.  It's interesting, but I wish there was a better way to read it than to have to keep clicking.  I've lost patience.  I'll return to it later.
