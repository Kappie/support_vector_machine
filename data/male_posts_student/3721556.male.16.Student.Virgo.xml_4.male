I am sitting here, playing games on the computer, in just a towel(just got out of the shower) And then my brother and his little doom minions come tearing into my godamned house and start mauling my cats! There's this one kid sean, that is going to be a serial rapist when he grows up, because he used to sneak into womens bathrooms when he was a little younger, and tried to watch women pee! He always makes comments about my girlfriends boobs and stuff, and it dives me mad! ANyway, these little bastards go into my room, throw my clothes everywhere,and once i grabbed sean by his shirt and dragged him outside, so the little shit went home and told his mom i friggen beat him senseless. grrrrrrrrr i hate them they're here right now chasing my cats and screaming and arguing over who gets to hold the cats when they catch them. meanwhile im still here barely clothed screaming at them to leave and it's like im invisible, omg sometimes i wish murder was legal in some instances! grrrr...
