Saw Johnny English....pretty funny....  I really shouldn't stay up like this...cause people tend to get more paranoid and depressed at night...according to my counselor...and he is a pretty cool guy...I have an appontment tomorrow too!....he is cool...lot better than my old one...  I am sleepy...I am done talkin to you...good night...  "Having trouble trying to sleep." -Green Day
