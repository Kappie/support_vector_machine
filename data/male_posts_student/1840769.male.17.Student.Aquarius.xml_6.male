I much rather want to study compared to working...Sitting down here doing my, I dunno, 200th set of slides in my 3 years here....Must be, I have lost track of the many silly sets of slides that I have to do...Why it is such a must in the corporate world, I have NO clue...Consultants do more...I think they probably do 200 a year...So what in the world was I thinking when I was thinking about joining consultancy when I'm done with my bond?  I'm sitting down here doing slides, feeling hungry, and feeling tired from the week already...There is so much to be done and so little time!!! ARGH....But I do admire all of you NTU people who go through the Singapore system...I think Engineering here is harder than it is overseas...Just a hunch....=)  So you guys are really full-fledged engineers with the real knowledge....I'm just a person who knows the theory....with ZERO hands-on experience....  Shall hide in my little cuby hole during lunch and do my quiet time, eat lunch and just chill out.....  Brandon - Good to hear from you, even though you were bored...At least we know that you are bored and we know what's happening to you....  Ang Cai and Jiam - Hang in there....=)  Do your tutorials, and be good....Hee hee....
