They are making the ultimate sacrifice so that we can remain a free and proud nation, and for that, they have my utmost respect. These people are going over to a foriegn country (and currently soverigine I might add) and defeating evil every single day.   Some of you may have heard of a man named Patrick Tillman, a former football player who gave up a 3+ million dollar contract with the Arizona Cardinals, in order to go preserve American Freedom in Afghanistan. I want you to ask yourself one question: Would you have given up that kind of money to fight for America? Honestly, would you? Would you give up a million dollar mansion, expensive cars, fancy resturaunts and all the luxeries that come with being wealthy? If you answered yes then you also have my utmost respect, but the chances of you saying "yes" and being 100% honest with your self is very slim. Pat Tillman is true American, and a true hero.  When I think about the men and women in our military, I think of someone who is willing to sacrifice everythin in order to make America safer, and to those people, home and abroad, I thank you. No longer are the days where I consider TV stars, or sports stars my heros, nope, those days are over. You, the men and women serving our country, are the true heros, and deserving of all the treatment that comes along with that status.   If you have a family member or a friend serving in Iraq, or in Afghanistan, or anywhere else in the world, please tell them that a blogger back home, named Whitey McCracka thanks them for there sacrifice and valor.
