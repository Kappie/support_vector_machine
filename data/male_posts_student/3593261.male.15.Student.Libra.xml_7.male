Yesterday, wasted nearly $40 on TYS....the books were darn expensive...but I don't mind paying price tags...Today, woke up around 6am and read through my physics textbook....brushed my teeth, washed my face with facial care, and chew a piece of mouth-freshtener....  Yesterday, I saw a terrible video of Iraqis beheading Nick Berg....gosh..that was so horrible...it reminds me of Hari Raya Haji...the slain sheeps...yucks! My friend from the US, just came back from Iraq...he was a soldier back there...I didn't believe he would make it alive to USA....since there are many gunfights involved that left many soldiers mortally wounded and dead...He showed me a website that shows a link to the unbroadcast videos of beheading....  Probably the most horrible of all, is the beheading of the South Korean, Mr Kim Sun-il....it was a pity...he said " Your Life is important. My life is important...and I don't want to die..."  Well, those terrorists are certainly heartless....they did this because of holy war?!What the f-k is wrong with them? Didn't they know that it is treacherous and evil tomurder someone? They don't have the slightest idea.....it's misconception...a pure deliberation attempt to halt the communityof Islam in the world..  Enough of that..ifyou want thevideo..askit from me...I will letyou upload from my computer.  Too many bad stuffs happened yesterday...and probably the most astonishingrude moment in my life was when I met a sec 2boy in my school....gosh..Itook a step back and began to lost my cool....he was so impatient....and he acted like a spoilt brat....gosh....his behaviour can't be tolerated....the situationis perplexed...first off, he was a kind brat...and in the next moment, he was a spoilt shit.... I tried to be nice to him but I guess...it doesn't have any effect on the boy...like the saying goes " No point pouring water to soften a hardrock ".... I hope I don't meet him again..if i do...i would justignore him...
