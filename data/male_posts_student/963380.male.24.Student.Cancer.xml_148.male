"Boh-d" Like I'm trying to say bold with a nose full of mucus.  To top it off, you guess, the abject failure returns. Glennis has been reassigned to my department. I want him dead. I want him gone. I want him anywhere but here. I hate his fucking guts.  And yet I get to smile to his face, for team players don't hate each others fucking guts.  I am not a team player.
