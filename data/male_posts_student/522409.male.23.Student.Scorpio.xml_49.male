This is the part of the process that makes me really happy.  Well, I suppose this part and everything that follows.  I think holding the finished product in my hand will be the ultimate.  Tomorrow new guy Micah is coming into the studio to hang out and hear how it's all going.  Made me think about my first day in the Sound.  I drove up to the house at Long Pond, and "Billie Jean" was blasting out the windows and doors.  It was a beautiful day, and I walked inside and heard that playing ( 110  had just been mastered and sent off to the printer) and couldn't believe my ears.  Big, goofy grin.  Can't wait to see Micah's reaction to this new cd.  Or anyone else's, for that matter.  I've still got to redo the Vincent Price monologue at the end and do some funky spoken word stuff for the end, but the list of stuff left to do to "Thriller" is getting really short.  5 down, 2 to go.   Two thank yous are in order:  Abby, thank you again so much for IMing last night.  I've missed you and it was, as I said, really nice to know someone cared right then.  V, many thanks for your email.  I don't think I ever expected to hear from you again, but hoped I would.  Thanks for sending up a flare, and keep reading.  I'll try to keep writing for both of us.  Ha.  There are only 24 days left until I head back to Cape Cod for the summer.  Last summer was not the best summer of my life, even though I thought it would be.  My first summer in the group was by far the best, and I doubt if the range of emotions that helped fuel that summer will ever be duplicated--such a delicate chemistry, to be sure.  But I'm becoming increasingly convinced that if any summer had the potential to rival that first summer as the best ever, this one is it.  Our new guys are ridiculous, we've got a new house, new cd, new attitude, and what promises to be an almost entirely new repertoire. (bringing back only 10 songs out of 40 from last summer, and looking to add 40 new songs to those 10 to round out the summer repertoire)  So welcome, new guys, thank you, friends and mostly-anonymous readers, and fasten your seatbelts, Cape Cod.  We're back in the house on May 24.  Holy...  "In a world full of people only some want to fly isn't that crazy?" -Seal  Talk soon.
