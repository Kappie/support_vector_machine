The links and colors and reactions of links and placement and whatnot are controlled by her through my pitiful, humble computer. Let us return to smiting; I shall smite thee if you do not admit her awesome dynamic.  (However, I got one thing by myself. The commenting system! Bwahaha)  Went to an English pub tonight. I ate fish n' chips (spelled with a n', damnit) with malt vinegar. Then I suffered some type of convulsion when I realized I was eating my fish  n'  chips (fries) off a newspaper. Which directly mimics  Angela's Ashes . I am an Englishman-not-really-while-damning-my-luck-to-be-American. But it was fun in any case.  Elise is performing the second Antigone of three tonight. I am missing her online now. I wish for her to be online for no good reason. I am whiny and whimsical. What a pity. ("That pale-faced man over there..." "That's not a boy! That's a girl!" Elise dressed in blood and shadow for bad news).  'tis all, mortals. Cheers.
