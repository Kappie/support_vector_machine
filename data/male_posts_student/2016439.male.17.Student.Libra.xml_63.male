The field trip yesterday was almost interesting...except for the insane allergy attack that I had starting the moment we left the city and that went on until we stepped back inside the school building.  Yeah, that was definitely not fun.  However, I love being in nature, however cruel she may be to me.  There's nothing like feeling a cool breeze caressing your cheeks as you walk through a field of wildflowers while listening to a family of birds chirruping happily to one another.  Being outdoors always brings back so many happy memories of my childhood.  How I wish that I spent more time in the country!  Perhaps that's why I love going to my grandmother's house and my family's ranch down in south Texas.  Life is always so simple yet so refreshing when you get outside of the chaos of the city.  I laugh at myself as I say that because I could never see myself living in the country.  It was crazy: as we drove through the miles and miles of countryside, I saw houses that could have been two or three miles apart if not more.  I could not imagine living in that much seclusion.  I need the city around me, I need to feel the pulse of human life, and I need to feel a part of something.  Nevertheless, I would love to have a country cottage (not a house, not a mansion, maybe a cabin, but for sure a cottage) to go to during the summers.  I'll put that down on my checklist for things to get if I ever have enough money :-)  I'm really excited right now because after a great conversation with my mother about college and where I want to go, I'm going to get to go to Los Angeles this summer to visit the  urlLink University of Southern California .  After almost two months of intense research and dreaming, it's a relief and a pleasure to know that I'll get to visit the school before applying.  Coupled with the Honors Colloquium at  urlLink UT , I'll have my top two schools covered before the beginning of school next year.  More exciting and even stranger still was the conversation I had with a couple of my friends about how this time next year we'll all know where we're going to college, and some of us what we want to go into as a career.  Now, while I've had a  urlLink strong idea  for quite a while, that could always change within the next year or even the next five years.  Who knows?  It's just exciting to think about it.  At the same time, it's a little depressing to think that I'll be leaving behind several incredible friends.  There's a difference between leaving a friend behind and leaving behind someone with whom you have shared so many experiences--good and bad--over the past six or so years.  Graduation is bittersweet, but I guess that's how it's supposed to be.  But hey, we still have another year left; and oh, what a year it will be!  Between band (hopefully being a drum major again), newspaper (we'll see where I stand here in a couple of months), National Honor Society, theater (I've decided to take it up again), taking four AP classes in school, and self-studying for at least four others, it'll be a busy yet fun-filled year.  Life is good.
