It was very much a "do what's in your heart, don't go work for law firms" message, which is a great message for them to be telling us, I think.  I was just surprised, honestly, how broad their definition of "public interest" is -- basically anything that isn't a corporate law firm, which is cool.  I can't really make fun of this presentation -- I thought it was really cool.
