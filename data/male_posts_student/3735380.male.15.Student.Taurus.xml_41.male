There were about 85 students in all. Today is only the second day and I've already made about 15 new friends. Previously, though, I have been an internet addict for the whole summer. Is this a nice way to train your social brain, or is it just a coincidence?  In a poll asked  urlLink here (click)  the opinions are divided 2/3 to 1/3.  So what do you think?
