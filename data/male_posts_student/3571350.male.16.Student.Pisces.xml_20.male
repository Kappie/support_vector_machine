I just talked about the situation in my life and how I'm feeling about everything. I'm thinking better about myself like how I look and how I represent myself even though some people don't like how I look well this is me :D I want to see carrie :( She lives a town away so we have to "arrange" to meet each other and hang out. I love her to death!! By the way my two favourite reality shows started last night which are big brother and amazing race. I AM SO EXCITED I watch every episode. I hate people who are really cocky and think their all that especially on shows. I need to say this im relaxing more but it might be a stage :p Well i see my therapist against friday be sure of it i will tell you what happens since I am soo stressed and overwhelmed talking about my issues and I NEED to get it out there!! Also nothing to eat :( But there's cheerioos in which i hate with milk since it drags the taste out of it. Anywho BYE BYE FOR NOW! Maddy im sorry but are you a guy or a girl?
