I was discussing about Diwali with my Colleague yesterday ( He is a Punjabi)  found out that in the North,  Diwali is Celebrated commomorating Ram's return to Ayodhya after the 14 Years of exile. Ask any south Indian  he will tell you Diwali is celebrated because Lord Krishna killed Narakasura . Strange that such a paradox exists within the same country !! Probably thatz the reason why India is a land of unity in Diversity ..
