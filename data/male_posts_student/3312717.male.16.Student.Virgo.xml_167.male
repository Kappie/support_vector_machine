Oh man... the movie itself wasn't really better than the first, but it built on what the first had established so as to make it a better all-around experience.   Also, the guys who played Flogging Molly ended up winning the Battle of the Bands... Furthermore, upon hearing Mattson's angry (what else?) rant against the psuedopunks, i've come to realise the only REAL punks in this world are actually Mattson and the Oselands. Nobody else qualifies. They're all pseudos, since they don't know what they're talking about.  So can one be an individualist without being punk? I think so. It's possibly better. Individualists would simply do whatever fits themselves best, whereas punks or noncomformists would have their views shaped by society as much as conformists would, only that theirs would be oppositely polarized. Don't work to go against society, because that's as little yourself as going with it.   All I know is that those guys won the Battle of the Bands. Is this not what they set out to do? Yes, it is. They acheived this by performing, pretty well, in fact, the tried and true songs that people already are known to like. Songwriting is a skill, not so much a talent - very few young people have the ability to write decent songs. Even the Newmans' songs began to wear on me after long enough, and all three of those guys rock. It was only the good stuff I could bear.
