Anyways, he was saying how since American businessmen were afraid of stocks going down of the war, and how this Iraqi was saying how that is a concern, and plans to become defeated as quickly as possible to protect their portfolios... then offhandedly mentions "oh look, there goes my living room". Then Linwood ends off saying "glad to know that there are people halfway around the world who care about us".   Oh... i also heard there's a bunch of civilian casualities so far, and that the war is going to go on for quite a while. Well, as long as it doesn't hurt the economy, ne?   As the war goes on, we have our own problem to deal with... QARI! Quite Acute Respiratory Illness is spreading around and killing and infecting and such... half our Saturday class decided to be absent either   a) their parents were afraid of QARI hurting them, and wanted to keep them home b) an excuse to skip   oh ... that reminds me... it's actually SARS for those that have been hibernating. I just thought that QARI would make a more fitting name   ~Chronos
