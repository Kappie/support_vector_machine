This ain't that good as the previous one I wrote, a few posts down, and the first theme is kinda blatant.    Untitled     As yesterday's visions haunt my sleep And past images invade every waking moment. I could only hope that time would be the source of all erosion. For a lost love I no longer pine. Amongst fleeting glances as we dine. For what hope is a love not blessed by all things divine?  As a plank about the ocean I slowly drift, A message in the bottle, hoping for someone to pick. Hoping for the monsoon to bring me to an island. A faraway land, which only the winds would bring me there. Amongst the vast sea, lonely and free. But this island I could not see.  For in there would I find comfort and solace. Not looking back to the ship which I once left.
