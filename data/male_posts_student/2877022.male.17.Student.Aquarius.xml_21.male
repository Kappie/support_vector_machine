And one effective way is to keep hold of my "tap" card and help me tap it on the scanning machine when i'm not in sch =P .  There seems to be nothin for me to write on asaturday morning when school (or rather band pra)begins later. ok, let's tok about ydae. Crazy me actually left the hos 40min after i arrived there (after almost 30 min's travel) juz to play pool with the guys @ mambo (hooray! i spent less than 1hour to get there from hos) . HAHA. I WAS SCOLDED BY MY MUM FOR MY IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOUR! haiz.... despite that, i trashed ivan + janet with 3 or 4 balls in a row, finally with justin hitting the black ball into the corner hole. yoyoz. well, sorry to justin, i wasn't performing after that game. =P  Ha, all of us were discussing why nus din wanna come to pool. I was told that she wanna stay home to do PW. janet was told that she wanna ZZZ and log on to MSN. (both of us were screamed by her into our ears). ok, wadeva the case i wouldn't noe nor bother to find out the truth. Using my PW's analysis technique and skill, i drew conclusion that nus's a good liar (note: she's not the best) Opps, i shdn't haf leaked out the fact that i forgo mean gal outing for pooling!  racial harmony day's mon? seriously, will anione wear ethnic costume? i think i'll look silly lor! see, I LOVE NJ GREY -_-"'
