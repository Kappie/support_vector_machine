Well, maybe soon or something we will have an actual page upon which you can see the cast members. This reminds me, lurker hunter, has joined the team. His best work to this day would be erk and sane, a fire emblem remix that if it isn't already up in the music section ,will be up there shortly. So far, we are working on more midis (duh!) and also there will be a page dedicated to chuckles, the near incompetent administrator that works at summer school, the likes of which lurker and I attend. And in other news: I will post wired photos like this every update day. Thereby marking something significant. Or not.
