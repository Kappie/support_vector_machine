My mates asked me if I wanted to go out that night but I can't becasue I have my jujitsu class. We're going to see a band soon tho. My folks went on holiday today so its just my sister and me at home for the week, she is always at work tho so I pretty much have the house to myself which is cool except it means I actually have to do some housework. I was trying to learn a new guitar lick today (Damn Yankees - Piledriver) but couldnt find the tabs anywhere, so that sucked. Think I will be goin to town on monday to look for new clothes, maybe get a few college supplies and a new guitar stap.
