Little Straaaanger....(until song ends)    Now that's power right there, awesome song right there, download it now...I'm serious, do it.  Anyways, I'd like to say "hey" to "Sue", new here at posting, so, hey "Sue", how's it goin'?  In other crap, shit's the same as always, I'm getting progressivly pissed with the band leader of Lycanthrope, or however you spell that.  Still, we have a concert coming up in October, a "Battle of the Bands" at some school. As soon as I find out more about it, anyone who wants to go is welcome to.  It's gonna be real fun, and this one will happen...so long as I don't kill Eli first.  I'll put up with him b/c I can put him in his place too, but moreso b/c this is something I wanna do, and I can get on stage, no bull shit.  Even though most of you probably don't care, we also have a website under construction, but I won't give the URL 'till it's up and runing.  Also, I'm about to start mastering our latest recording to try to make the instruments sound out more, b/c we have real bad recording equipment. Once that's done, you can ask me for the mp3 if you wanna hear.   I'm Deadinside, and that's my death threat for today.  "¿Qué horas son, mi corazón?"
