Now a days, these kids have bad heroes.  They have, like, The F Word Man, Scantily Clad Women Man, Pelvic Thrust man, and The Double Entendre Boy.  These guys can't do anything!  If there's, like, King Kong on top of the building with a princess, they couldn't save the princess.  They'd get there and they'd cause more trouble.  I mean, all The Double Entendre Boy will do is keep referring back to when the building was erected.  The Scantily Clad Women Man will just use the building as a pole.  The F Word man will just curse King Kong out, and Pelvic Thrust Man won't even show up.  So next time you get kidnapped by an ape, call the Power Rangers instead.  Just a thought.
