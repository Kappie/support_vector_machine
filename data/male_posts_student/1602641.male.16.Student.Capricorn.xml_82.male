I was at first appauled by the thought of Will Smith taking on the lead role in an Isaac Asimov story, but after reading the article in Wired I had a change of heart. I'm interested to see what reflection this movie makes on our society, a society where we have toilets that flush themselves; f.y.i.: I don't like a robot telling me when I'm done.
