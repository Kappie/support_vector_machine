But anyway, I'll be much less frequent here due to my exams that are coming, and the exceeding connection bill. But I guess my guest would have all disappeared by now. But to all who drops by still to check if I'm updating, sorry for the trouble. And thanks for your time still.  Anyway, I've come to decided to take the baptism class. I don't know if I'll be getting baptised. That's if something unusual crops up along the way such that I back out. It's been quite a decision to make. In fact, I probably was leaning more towards not doing it. I decided to, not because I felt I was strong spiritually, but because I became aware of the misconceptions in my faith and practices and my sinfulness. I realised that I've been comparing with human standards. As a christian, I attempted to be perculiar, to be different. But I was only making sure that I was different from others. In a way, I was comparing with people, which led to me being judgmental and filled pride at times. And eventually, became a road block to my growth. But I realised that it is God standards we are to be comparing with. For we are to in Christ's likeness as Christians. And it is God's glory that we have fallen short. And it's really something important I learned. And I really hope that I could do my very best to live this life for God. And if this is so, there's really no reason that we should wait to get baptised.Thank God for the lesson.
