It's been much too long since the last time we all got to visit, and I get the feeling with so many of them getting married that it'll be a long time before we're all able to meet again.  Been working on Crooked Halo scripts. Got the next three or four scripted out, and hope to have a few more before I leave. The only problem right now is that my ink pen is about to die. I can't go a week and a half without drawing or writing anything while I'm in Arkansas, so I'll have to get some more pens tonight when I go to Target for Scott (they've got a videogame sale going on--a couple of games he wants are only $15, which is a pretty damn good deal).  Ev only has a few more pages of Master's Thesis to read through, and says he'll have it for me tonight. That means I can get corrections done on it before I leave, which'll be nice. Just wish I could get ahold of Dr. Hart so he could look at it, too.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Bruce Springsteen, "Ghost of Tom Joad"
