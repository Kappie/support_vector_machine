It still doesn't have its flair anymore.  It lacks that certain something that gave Tyke a mini-rush for writing it.  And it takes time.  But then again, Tyke just realized that he shouldn't "whine" about not wanting to blog.  That would be stupid.  Because it isn't like he is being forced to blog.  He could easily stop one night and just not do it.  Tyke actually thinks that he could just not do it for a night and then resume the next day without anyone even noticing.  At least for a few days.  But that could be a poor assumption.  Anyway, Tyke will just continue to blog in brevity until he feels the desire to beef it up again.  1st period was pretty funny today.  Tyke was supposed to be in this one group for a presentation but he decided to go work in a group that actually had some stuff done and he made a nice contribution too so he wasn't just taking credit.  But the group he was supposed to be in was totally hilarious in their presentation.  Can't really be described on a blog though.  But it was classic.  The rest of the day was stupid.  4th period was kinda funny.  And then they left early again and went to JIB.  It was real real good.  They had so much time to eat too that they finished early even.  A great choice to go there early by Tyke.  Splendid.  Good pick by Amed to pick JIB as well.  The days really aren't that bad at school but Tyke isn't doing any homework and soon that will hurt him.  Like tonight he should have done this Graphics work, should have done some math (although he will do that in the morning), and could have done some english.  But he just doesn't want to.  So he doesn't.  Tyke has actually been doing less hw this semester than last he realized.  Ok, Tyke took about 20 minutes off from blogging just now.  Man, the Cougs are leading the Cardinal right now.  And Stanford is undefeated.  And the Cougs suck.  This is a great game.  Well, Tyke doesn't really have anything more to say since he has no idea what he has been talking about for most of the blog.  Hopefully Fejj makes the team tomorrow.  That would be cool.  But tomorrow means WEEKEND!!!  WISH TYKE LUCK!!!  (with what? nobody knows...)  Just so all of you that don't follow college basketball that well, Tyke will let you know something.  Tyke just witnessed one of the most incredible endings to a sports game ever.  The WSU Cougars were mere seconds away from pulling off an insane upset over the #1 ranked undefeated Stanford Cardinal.  But in the most dramatic finish in recent history the Cardinal, thanks to a fouled prayer by Matt Lottich, won in just flat out jaw-dropping fashion.  That was just remarkable.  Unbelievable.  Incredible.  Wowness.  Bye.  *mutters to himself as he "walks" away WOW.
