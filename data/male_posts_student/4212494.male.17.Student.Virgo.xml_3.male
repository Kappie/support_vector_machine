You're SUPPOSED to be thinking "Wait a second...it's Saturday, Shawn's never online Saturday!!  How is he posting in his blog?"  Well, the answer, my friends, is simple.  My mom's out at some fair today, while I'm not.  Hooray.  So, I took the time to go online.  Do I have a life yet?          Yep.  Well, nothing exciting really happened today.  Last night I went to a friend's house, but it was nothing special.  Well, there was the hot, hot, man sex....I'm kidding.  Well, as far as you all know, anyway.  *cue X-Files music*          Aaanyway, yeah.  I guess I'm done for today.  Here's hoping my life gets more exciting soon!  XD          RFQD:      Me:   So, did you ask her out yet?  I mean, everyone knows you like her except her...      Martin:   Umm...Well, no.      Me:   Why don't you?  I mean, of course, she could say "No, I hate you, you're a fecking moron," then she could kick you into a vat of orange pudding, then you can eat it all, and say "Yum!".  Then, well....It would be a much happier experience than you figured.      Martin:   *hands me a helmet*  Put this back on and go play in traffic again, mmkay?
