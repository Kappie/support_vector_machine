But tomorrow I have late arrival, so it shouldn't be too bad, and I'm getting an award of somesort for my achievement in scholastic excellence.  Today didn't go too well. I woke up late and had to rush to strength training, working out sucks when you are really tired. The rest of school was pointless, didn't accomplish anything because I had nothing to do. After school I was planning on going to a friends lacrosse game, but unfortunately that didn't work out, so here I sit.  Have you ever had a dream where do you aren't really sure whether its real or not? I had one of those this morning. Saved by the Bell is on at 7 every morning, so I always try to wake up and watch it. I remember waking up but the rest is pretty sketchy. The episode was really weird, and then I woke up again like 15 minutes after the episode. I don't really know if I was asleep the whole time and dreamt the whole episode, or if I actually watched it and just fell asleep at the end. This is the second time that it has happened so I though that it was pretty strange. But yeah, I have a lot of crazy dreams that don't make too much sense, I'll post one the next time I have a real vivd one.
