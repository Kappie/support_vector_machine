Hey whatever it is I can't tell you guys how excited I am even though I won't be the baby of the family anymore *sob* *sob* but I am happy to give away my spot to the little one..... Oh...! Bhabhi just the spot not the room yet (don't get too happy)....I hope its a very healthy and cute cute baby (Just like me :D). I am really excited October just can't get here soon enuff...I have asked more like begged the baby to kick for me many times but the baby just doesn't listen to me...Stubborn baby I wonder like whom...hmmm...*thinking*      Baby shower was really fun....I guess I will write more as October arrives and I guess I will be the first person to post after the baby arrives to clear up if its Baby Ria or Aryan...till then keep guessing.....      Oh something about my personality...      Physical: You guys don't wanna know...   Good qualities too many too little space...   Bad qualities...I just don't have any...:D    Daughter, Sister, Masi, Bhuwaaaa 2 be, wife never to be.....how ya like that brother?
