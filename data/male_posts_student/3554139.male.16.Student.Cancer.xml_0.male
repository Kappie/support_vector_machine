I found some kick ass pictures of Jesus on google, for some reason. This guy beside me keeps on calling me godboy. I guess I'm the athiest godboy. That's it. Screenname change.  if bStevegod then showmessage ('I am changing my screenname to Athiest Bible humper'); end   You know what?  I miss programming class. What the fuck?  Whatever. I got ot see Hillary today, which was alright. We played truth or dare wit hJoel and Jacquie for a bit. I was dared to french her, so it was a good game. Well, that's about it for today, so..well..  -Adios  -Steve
