And now here I am sitting here bored, with Courtney sitting behind me playing with sewing needles, I guess thats the fun thing to do now. Nobody's around. Caitlyn is working until 5, Eric is in Vermont, Alyse is at summer camp, she won't be back until Friday, and then she goes back on Monday, Roman is in Florida, CJ... well id on't know what he's doing, probably sitting at home whacking off, and i haven't really seen Jay around. He was being mean to me yesterday. He wouldn't get me a hatchetman off of Ebay again, cuz he lost the last bid. Lizzie's probably too busy being up Jay's ass, or having crazy, wild sex with him. hmmm... beats me! Oh well!!! i'm bored people, come and get me and do something fun with me, before I waste my life presentng my mallrat life at the Silver City Galleria Mall. Ya' know, sometimes I wish we still had school, friends, fights, teachers to bitch at, school lessons sometimes gives you random ideas to write a story about or draw about, it's funny, but I won't see those days until August 31 when I have to go back to the hell-hole of Taunton High School!!! later Maggots!!!
