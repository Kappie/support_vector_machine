I, Killa Cal, who had previously made bold statements such as, "I'll never let one of these internet people get to me" and blahzay blue have let a simple minded BP chat female get me shook up to a minor degree....mind you it was nothing of any serious magnitude....but enough to wake me up and help me realize that I'm in medical school for Pete's sake....I shouldn't be in there anyway!!!  So thank you Redbonechick72 for showing me the err of my ways....  I'll miss Miss ToyaJ and Bean and Asher and Sweetness and other people with strange chat names but hey....I really met some interesting characters in Blackplanet....but I needed to call it quits so I feel safe in saying.....  To Hell with Black Planet!!!....
