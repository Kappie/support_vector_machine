On Saturday my parents went to Italy to ski, I was hoping for a wild week and even though I wasnt home alone I did think that I would have a good time since I the oldest and can beat my siblings up if I want the remote control. But no the teachers decided to ask us for 7 projects in the same week and 4 of those in the same subject! We were very anoyed by one of those coz' we had to ask 30 people what were the first three things that came to mind when some brand was mentioned. We figured this had little if anything to do with our marketing studies but the teacher is making her on research on that subject so it was very handy to get us to do all the hard work. Anyway I stayed in the school all day for that week and only once I came home to eat, so Im just glad its over.  I was pretty certain I would have to go out on friday coz' just to have some good time this week so I signed up for the sience trip on Friday. In this one we went to Iceland Express which is similar to Ryanair but only flies from Iceland to Denmark and England. They had a lecture on the company for half an hour maybe more and gave free beer while talking, usually they give free bear during the lecture and then for an hour afterwards but they didnt have enough so we had to start buying right after which sucked. I once again had to play the drunk Icelander and got completely out of hand, hit on a exchange student (you have to be friendly) and then went home with some girl which was a huge waste of money. the worst sex ever and cap expenses were in total something like 50 $. Today I went to play football, it was surely a hangover ball coz' I didnt have the strength to run after anything so i just stayed in goal and passed the ball up the field.  My dad just bought the sport channel for one month (not the actual channell) so Ive watch some football on tv, on Wednesday I watched Man City against Tottenham coz' Icelands national keeper just signed for the prior and played the match. It was a great match coz' Tottenham were 3-0 nil up at halftime and at halftime one City player got redcarded. So there wasnt much hope, but the match ended 4-3 and Arni Gautur had an outstanding match, Schmeichel said he had the save of the season so he did pretty well.  Thats it for now.  Later, Ãšlli  p.s. I just signed up Kat so I hope she will start bloging soon.
