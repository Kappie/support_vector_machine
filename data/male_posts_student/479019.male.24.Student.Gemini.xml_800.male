Indeed, I feel that the Bush Administration has a horrifying foreign policy and very shady domestic security policy. However, they didn't have the same expansionist foreign policy and systematic domestic policy of elimination in concentration camps. Didn't Chomsky say that the United States is not a totalitarian regime in regards to use of force, and it is rather its consent building? While the Patriot Act sucks, it's certainly nothing like what went on in Stalinist Russia or the other fascist regimes of the early 20th century.  If anything it's closest to the British Empire in its militarism, imperialistic desires, and treatment of poor within its own borders. Actually many scholars say that America basically took over for the British Empire following WWII as the world hegemon.  I like how Dr. Frank updates his blog frequently and posts really insightful stuff. It would be really interesting if someone like Greg Graffin did that too.  Bad Religion  is my favorite band, but sometimes they seem either too busy for the common fan like they used to... or stuck up?  Anyway I'm see  MTX  on the 18th at Chain Reaction. See y'all there!?  ***
