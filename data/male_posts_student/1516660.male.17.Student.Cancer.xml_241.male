In the morning, we went to Marsiling to eat breakfast and buy flowers for the goddess (I ate laksa). Yeah. After that, we (brother and I) came back while the parents went to Ang Mo Kio to buy some incense.   For lunch, we went to Woodlands Central. I ate fried carrot cake. Ha. After that, I brought a new bag. Same colour (not really...ayiah! Red la...darker only). Then, we went to Sheng Shiong to buy foodstuff and household items. HaHa. We brought 4 crabs to eat. So many crabs are missing limbs. So er xin. (HaHa. Eeny's left pincer fell off when we put it in our 'crab box'!)  After going to Woodlands Central, we came back to put goods and went to the library/Causeway Point. First, we went to Causeway Point to eat (KFC) and buy HansVision, a chinese software. Mine stupidly expired somehow. Then, we went to the library to borrow books. Along the way, we also brought new windows. Nah...we didn't really buy. We just signed up to buy. It's one of those rotational 180degrees window thingy. It has a lifetime garuntee that it won't fall off. HaHa.   After we came back, I installed HansVision. YaY!! The MahJong game worked properly!! Got real chinese characters and everything! Finally! I can figure out what the characters are saying, instead of looking at boxes and squiggly lines. HaHa.  At 6, I went out to eat dinner. Then, at 7.30 came back, bathed and wtched some TV. Viola. I am here.  Alright. I gotta be ending. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
