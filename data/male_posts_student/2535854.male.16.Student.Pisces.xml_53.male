Ok went by Sasa 2day..lookin 4 a new aftershave and they didnt have it!all they had was after shave balm!I want the 1 with fragrance!WTf do I gotta go now to find it?I cant keep taking my bro`s Dior aftershave!And Sasa didnt have the CK Eternity!All oso perfume or frgrance or whatever!  Ok got the 4711-Ice Cologne stuff 4 my mom..took me ages 2 figure it out!  hmm met Seok Ling afterwards..despite her mom around she still stopped 2 talk..she looks tired and a bit worn out if u ask me..when he mom looked back to see where she was,I swear she gave me a cold look.A very cold look even...I wonder if her mom still 'rather opposes her mixing around with guys'?  Ok hmm chatting with Cheryl rite now..what else...finished packing my bags since IM OFF 2 PANGKOR TOMORROW!My moms like.."make sure evrythings ready by 2marow so we can leave as soon as we balik from sembahyang raya..."avoid guests..the`ll probably still think my Grandmas at my place when she left 4 my aunties place on Friday..  Stayin at the Swiss Garden...Its on the Mainland actually..not staying on the island cause my bro says theres nothing there almost cause its so small...  ok anything else 2day I missed out?oh yeah  Realised that Valentines day is on a Saturday!Should gather some peeps up and go 4 dinner at somewhere like I dunno The Dome?Chinoz?Anywhere else thats nice,not 2 expensive but has class? some1 tell me aights?anyway im off...hungry..later!  ~pEaCE~
