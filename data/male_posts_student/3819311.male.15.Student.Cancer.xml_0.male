The Merlion – half-lion, half-fish – on Sentosa is 37 metres high and has 320 scales sculpted from glass-reinforced concrete. By night, these scales are a sight to behold as they glow in different colours. Take the lift to the top floor and be rewarded with a 360° view of Sentosa and Singapore’s southern shores. From the Mouth Gallery Viewing Deck on level 9, you can even spot Singapore’s impressive skyline.   When you’re done gazing at the splendid views, head out the back and stroll down the Merlion Walk, a 120-metre-long Gaudi-inspired mosaic walkway. Treat your olfactory lobes to the aromas exuding from over 50 types of spice and herb plants in the Spice and Scented Gardens flanking both sides of the Merlion Walk.   taken from:  http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_merlion.htm
