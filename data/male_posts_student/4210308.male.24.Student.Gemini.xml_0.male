"Action Failed"....   sheeit!...   tried to keep my consecutive blog streak crackin...   at least I tried...   Just like my homeboy Edmark...   Yesterday we went to Friday's to celebrate his 24th birthday...   the plus was the Niners-Raiders game...   Raiders won...   but still....   Go Niners!...      Anyhow...   the universal plan for the birthday guy/gal...   is usualy to get them tow back....   you know...   Effed the eff up...   Ed kept it crackin...   2 hurricanes and a beer...   crackin until...   the Liquid Coca-een-a showed up...   "C'mon Ed, it's your birthday...   Just take it already!"...   20 minutes of coaching go by...   he finally says..."eff it"...   Shot in...   Shot out...   out in a spewing brown tone...   milkshake texture...   all over his brownie and ice cream cake...   at least he tried...   the worst part is that...   it was all...   Juvenile....-"Slow Motion...for me..."   i mean I was looking dead at the dude...   i'm pretty sure everyone else at the table was too!...   Karma's a beeya...   A couple a weeks ago...    my cousin Jr had his goin away party...   down at the 'Hukilau'...   Ed caught me gaggin off a sip of some Red Hook beer...   Nasty Sheeit, I tell ya....   He was crackin up at the time too...   You catch me gaggin....   I catch you yackin...   All good though....   Good Times...      Today...   Not much...   went to work....   Ooh!...   I'ma have Saturdays off for the rest of the year...   Aside from that...   kicked it with Steph today...   she came to the house...   had our "talk"...   we watched "Under the Tuscan Sun"...   Diane Lane...   Hott!...   It was an alright movie...   I mean I thought it was gonna be...   a sap of the mill...   full of cliches...   sob story...   chick flick...   the message I took from it...   and I always take messages from movies...   was something like...   "what you want and expect from life...   will come...   but not always in the way that you plan or want it"....   make sense?...   just watch!...   anyway...   tomorrow i'm off to prepay my Oly's...   Olympic Jordan 7's...   Not really feelin em...   but i'ma cop...   for fear of regretting not getting them when I had the chance...   I really really want...   the black/true red 7's...   but them bitches is like 160 online...   oh well!...   Liquid cocaine is bad...   Cocaine is worse...   brownies are the worst...
