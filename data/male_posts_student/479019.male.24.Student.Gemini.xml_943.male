At first it was really weird in that they set up a stage in the plaza before entering the museum. The stage was next to a statue of Gene Autry, pictures of indians and rather close to the Mary Pickford Educational Center. I’m not going to get into sociological discussions of social definitions of space, but to put it simply it was really weird.   I missed the two openers and was inline for beer, when I heard "O.C. Life" being played. I ditched the beer line (which was moving very slow) for D.I.’s set (they also closed with the Agnew / Adolescents song "Amoeba"). I guess that makes up for not seeing the Adolescents last weekend. Anyway I just decided to enjoy the show sober for the rest of the night the beer line was just too slow. The crowd wasn’t really into D.I., but they really got into the Dickies. Those guys were hilarious. T.S.O.L. was insane and so was the crowd. There was minimal security so there was a lot of stage diving. A guy also broke his leg in the pit, whom I helped carry out. Anyway… it was particularly insane when they closed with "Code Blue." 25-30 of us stormed the stage and started a mosh pit ON THE STAGE. So I was in a mosh pit on a stage with TSOL in a museum. That was just surreal.  This is mainly for hardcore Bad Religion fans, but in between bands, they would show videos of live performances of old school bands. Stuff like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, and Subhumans. Anyway, they actually showed Bad Religion doing "New Leaf" with Greg Graffin, Greg Hetson, and I think it’s Finestone on drums and Tim Gallego on bass.  Oh and you know the song Offspring song Bad Habit? Let just say Albert’s complaints about someone driving their care at 50 mph in the fast lane cease, when he sees their piece.  ***
