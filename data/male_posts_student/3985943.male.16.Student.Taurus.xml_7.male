I was thinking of either doing an English gentleman's library (the type where the guy goes on safari and brings all these cool things back) or a vintage, jazzy,black and white NYC theme. Any preferences? Just to help you out, here's whatI have in my room:      2 Drexel dark mahogany sleigh beds,      2 dressers, one with a mirror, one in a "highboy" fashion,      1 desk, with all my assorted computer stuff on it,       2 whitebookcases (i can replace these),      1 nightstand (matches the beds).      and 1 mahogany drum table (this can leave if necessary)      My carpet is a neutral, so that won't affect anything, and I have stained wodwork, which goes with both themes. All my accessories can be changed in a heartbeat, so don't let that stop you either. I hope to hear from you soon!
