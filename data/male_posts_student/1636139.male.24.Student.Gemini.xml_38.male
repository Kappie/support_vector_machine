Brown has a much stronger taste than white rice does so it seems almost unnecessary to use Soy sauce with it. They also use white pickled ginger instead of the usual pink variety. The miso soup was some of the best we'd had too. 
  
The other kewl thing that happened yesterday was that my  'free'  copy of 
 urlLink Panther  showed up. 
I opted to simply upgrade my existing system, which seems to have gone well :-)
