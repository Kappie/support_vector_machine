I could drop dead and she would criticize my form when dropping, the way I died, and then when the autopsy came back she would critize the cause of death and the way the coroner performed the autopsy! BLOODY FUCKING HELL there is no end to it for me. I go to cook supper and she says "noone wants a big meal". Am I noone, do I matter? Apparantly not. Neither does my sister it seems. She wants us to eat rice and potatoe skins and 1/2 of the meat we usually do? What the fuck does she think I am, her bitch? Then she barges in my room and I turn of the monitor, and she assumes I am looking at porn. Yes, because I just love porn *rolls eyes*. So she demands to see that it truly is a journal, so I flash the screen on and then off so she can see it is a journal but not the words. She then proceeds to barg in 4 more times. Bloody hell it is sickening. I wish I had some way of getting away from it all. Death is too permanent, to serious. Life is unbearable. A seperate vacation doesn't make fiscal sense. We cant even afford food! Its times like this I start to begrudge rich people, but then I remember theres a ryme and reason for this life. Maybe my reason was to be a support, but I can already feel the cracks forming on my sides and deep within. I am breaking slowly, and when I fall apart, God only knows what is going to happen. Will I die? Maybe. Will I MAKE myself die (you know what I mean)? I could, but probably won't. Will I be committed? Possibly. Will it be a breakdown? Certainly. Life isn't treating me right, so I am being rubbed the wrong way by my family. Its like my mom is treating us like her employees. Like it or not mother, I am only 15! I am ready for the real world, but want the innocence of my youth years. Damn I am sick of this. At this rate I will have a meltdown in 4 weeks. Percent complete to critical mass:40%.
