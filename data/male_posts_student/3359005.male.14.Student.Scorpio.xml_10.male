Can you believe it? After the stupid SARS homework being posted on the internet, the school seems to have found more eco-friendly to have us print our own homework out. Like I said before, death iways a good option.  Anyway I really have nothing to write about. I'm basically posting for the sake of posting. So today, like I said a few posts before, I shall tell you about my friend Chun Ming. I've also said that I have no doubt my relationship with him is nothing but friendship, because I knew him before my hormones started raging.  First to his appearance. He has a really, really broad face, even broader than mine actually. He used to be really skinny and stalky, but now I've reached puberty and I've grown to be of equal height. And now he's sporting a bulging tummy that he doesn't want to bring up. Really, sometimes when you look at him he looks like a Chinese version of Barry Manilow and Clay Aiken crossed. Just that his face is growing just a little plumper. That too is something he doesn't want to bring up.  Now to his character. Obviously told by his growing body, he is a a rwally bubbly person, if you get my drift. His mouth can never stop complaining and talking. But unlike the 'Jenna Awardee' Samuel See, he spouts things that actually make sense. He is a creative thinker, like me and was involved in the OM competitions. He has a knick for shooting off his mouth sometimes, and the younger petty me got really angry with him once for letting off a secret of mine. But now he usually keeps his mouth in check. I have a wierd feeling that he'll make it well in the corporate world, but his stupid ambition is to be a teacher. His has however a whole list of ambitions; from owning a bus company to being the head of the Land Transport Authority. Any tourists to Singapore on a shoestring budget, go to him for help for public transport...
