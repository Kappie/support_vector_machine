The Death of someone special causes a group of friends to re-examine their lives and their feelings about death. Fundamental questions are asked: Will i go to hell if i'm a bitch? Am I spending too much time at the Gym? Can i be gay and married?  The group of friends soon make important realisations: That you can be married and gay That you can be friends and use each other That you can be a TOP and BOTTOM  If you ask nicely, will your friend's corpse come back to life?  Taken from The Necessary Stage: TOP OR BOTTOM.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Well as you can see i have put up a new blog. This time its a totally different thing. The gay stuffs are staying. This time its going to be  MORE GAY! MORE EXOTIC!  well this blog is not meant for public view. So guys. I trust you.

Woke up early by a phone call from my "Sis" (my bestfriend Rashid aka Ra-Rah. He is a Drag Queen.) Fruit Cake man! (means FUCK MAN!)he disturbed my beauty sleep. Sheesh... well last night i went with Daniel, You are good looking Daniel...really serious... I thought i was going to meet the person i am saw in the pic. Well i was wrong.

Hahaha i used to have a crush on this guy from OBS he is in the other watch.. his name is Don Degan... he is so god dame cute just like my boyfriend. Well although my boyfriend doesn't wear braces its his hearts that counts. Haha.. I dono i think i have made Braces as my fetish now. HAHA!.   Well went out to go meet my friends at Admiralty Mrt station at around 7:45am. Took a train towards City Hall. Once reached there we walked towards the M.I.T.A building. Thats the place that we were suppose to go for our Art Workshop. Than we went to take our pass so nice! At approximately 9:20am we went up level three and head towards the streats room.  In the streats room well there were kinda alot of peeps there. From other schools. I didn't know it was a competition till that lady asked me where am i from and blah blah blah. Well ok lets get back. There was this guy in red shirt he came in kinda late but lucky he came in when the course have not yet start. Well when he went out to go to toilet he tripped and made a fool out of him self. Well a few peeps laughed but i didn't cause.. haha i had a crush on him from the minute he stepped into the room. Haha. Well erm he is very cute. Ok lets skip the boring course part.. Ok there was this short break. Well during the break i went to toilet and when i was in the toilet that cute red shirt guy came in. I washed my hands... he just like stood there and looked at me. heheh.. well i got out first than he came out second... i hold the door for him... and like he was blur blur whether to move out or not... hahaha so cute!... those eyes made contact with mine. I said that i hold the door for him and he murmured," OH thanks.". And i walked with him leaving that drag boy behind hahaha. We walked side by side... than when we reached the streats room door he opened it for me.. how sweet of him and we made eye contact again.. haha... and yes he left that drag boy behind haha. When the course continued back... he made a few glances at me... and so did i hahah.   Than my group and i had lunch... Well that red shirt guy finished lunch first... when i saw him leaving heading for fresh air outside... I quickly finished mine. Than i wanted to like go out and talk to him... but my team members were like went, "Den!? where u want to go?"... to make them not notice me that i wanted to cruise on that guy... i just told them i wanted to walk around... instead i walk the other direction, STUPID ME! i should gone out and talk to that Red-shirt guy!. Well a few newpaper reporters interviewed me again. And than that red-shirt guy came up to me and asked me a few question like whats my name... i was like melting there listening to his hot voice, looking at his hot and cute face... and staring at his hot and kissable lips... OH!. The bus came... I sat with my bestfriend, Azah, and that guy sat on the opposite side but behind.. At least he can see me hahaha. :P but i wanted to see him...   Every stop the bus made, He always like come near me... and hahaha i made an effort to go near him too hahah. Well at least we talked. The saddest part was that he had to go home early... but at least i stood really really really close to him like as if i am going to kiss him hahaha :P Azah complained like why my mood changed all of the sudden from hyper cheerful to like down sad. Well the reason to that was  HE WENT HOME WITH OUT SAYING A PROPER GOOD BYE!...  but at least i got his e-mail address and we are contacting each other regularly... well sort of hahaa :P well till here than.
