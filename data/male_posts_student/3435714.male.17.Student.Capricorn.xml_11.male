The camps point was to train us not to lose our Christian World View when we get to college and are barraged by professors that will oppose our world view. I made a ton of friends, the 4 guys in my dorm: Ben, mike, seth,  steven, the others are: Sam, Pat, Dan, Adam, Meg, Meg, Scott, Dess  the list goes on and on. There were 180 students total and on the last night there were people I talked to which I had never talked to before, Theres alot of them im gonna miss alot, There's 4 expecially that im gonna miss.   I plan to go back next year w/ my brother and hopefully see tham again. Well im gonna go cya later.
