So every now and then they run amok with new reports, on alcohol, tobacco, HIV/AIDS, obesity, the consequences of children's TV consumption, family issues, und so weiter. All with different solution where the public can interfere.    It is, of course, natural. If you have a welfare state, you can't really expect the public (other citizens that is) to stay out of your life if the public is going to pay when you treat your body in a unhealthy way. That's another road to serfdom for you to go down.  There ain't no such thing as a private life under the welfare state.
