MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!! thats the 2nd case of instant chemistry  3rd example Tanya shukla used to go in the bus and well we used to b good frends so we were jus playin an occasional game of truth and dare and we asked her who she liked and she actually told ONLY MEEEEEEEEEE seee ppl? u shud learn smtn here? thats called trust  Now she doesnt go in my bus:( thats real bad i tried convincin her to her to come in the bus, but she doesnt wanna come but she doesnt live very far away from my place..less than a kilometer so i can always pay her an occasional visit...im sure she wont mind  over the years i feel that tanya shukla now hates me but i really dont care coz every other person does  i gtg now  train pakadni hai ciao
