I havent had alot of contact with folk because I have not had access.   Well I watched and Over watched the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. It was supper funny. I also tried calling Rhae. Once again, her step mum picked up and said she was not home.  I have also been boared (still) and I have no pareticular reason to play Halo anymore because me and Lil'Steve beat it on legendary.   I have also watched the Tv show...Blue Collar Tv. That was really funny as well.   Besides these facts I have not done much but clean up. I need to clean my room again.   OH! I also went to see Dr. Rhoads. That whent well as usuall.  It also rain and flooded twice, and we had two bad storms.  That is about all I can think of to talk about for now   ^_^
