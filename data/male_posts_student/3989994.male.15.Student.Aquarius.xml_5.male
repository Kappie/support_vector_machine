Such terrible feelings i harbour, this entry is going to be rather short, after all the closets can actually be one who hurts most. I never expected him to, i mean would you turn around and betray your brother's trust?  Well he did, maybe not betray but he knew i wanted to be alone yet he kept asking me stupid questions, i mean if i wanted to tell i would why must you insist on knowing eveything? But it's never fair, instead of him my dad things i was being mean toward him! I cannot quite explain my feelings but i am just angry at the whole lot!   I quite am unhappy, have no idea what to do. I just suddenly have this sinking feeling that i have no chance to be president or vice, i just want it to all end! Secretly i harbour hopes of becoming the president but lets face the facts right! I have heard that certain people think that i use others to get what i want. I really don't but people are what people are, sometimes you wonder why we do things to hurt each other, is it just for revenge or perhaps jealousy?  Bereft and saddened my heart sinks to the bottom of the ocean. Light can no longer light the path and love just drowns.
