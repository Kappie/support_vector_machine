"You shouldn't kiss me like this, 'less you mean it like that, cuz I'll just close my eyes and I won't know where I'm at. We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinning around and around and around and around. They're all watching us now, they think we're falling in love-- they'd never believe we're just friends. When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that. If you do, baby, kiss me again."  Yeah, Toby.  Yeah.
