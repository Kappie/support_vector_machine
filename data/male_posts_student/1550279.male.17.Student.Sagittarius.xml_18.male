I think it went pretty will; everyone seemed to enjoy it, and someone in my class even told another one of my friends how good it was. I get to give another one tomorrow over King Tut which has to make use of a visual aid. Hopefully that one will go just as well.  Tonight I tried to log into Star Wars Galaxies to play (even though I don't particularly like the game and enjoy playing FFXI much more), but I ran into an interesting problem. Somehow my account has been cancelled, and I know that I'm not the one that did it. My only guess is that Sony cancelled it after an inactivity period (of what, 3 weeks??), so they got an email from me tonight asking them to "un-cancel" it. There's probably not a great chance that I'd be renewing my account anyway once my current subscription expires, but if I have to jump through hoops to get my account activated again, there's no way that I'm going to be playing this game that much longer.  Oh yeah, and there's been way too much rain here recently. Make it stop!!
