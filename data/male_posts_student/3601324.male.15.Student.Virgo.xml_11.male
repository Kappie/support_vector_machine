These aren't little kiddy fun-time rows though. These are  huge, monster, commercial farming  rows. It was hot and the rocks were hell on my knees. Even with knee pads. So I'm pretty exhausted and dirty right now. I think I'll go take a shower. A nice, cold shower. And then I'll drink some lemonade. Yesss, lemonade.
