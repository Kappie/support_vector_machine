For me, it's one of those days when I look back at my CD collection. I have a lot of CDs and there's too many to even think about.   This afternoon, I sat here, just looking at all of the CDs I've got. I mean, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, "Man, that Rage Against the Machine CD was awesome!" or "Wow, I remember when I first herd Beck's Sea Changes I didn't like it, but now I love it!" And stuff like that. And then again, I looked back at my shitty CDs, "Oh, Staind, OH GOD!" Or "Hoobastank, must have been high while buying that one!"   Well, I'm gonna continue my search for good CDs, while I do that, I'll search for good songs, such as Patti Smith's "Rock n Roll Nigger."   This post is dedicated to someone, you know who you are.
