My favorite band Third Eye Blind got dropped from their record label. Fuck Elektra. In fact, fuck the entire music industry.  My dog got released from the vet today after getting "grass poisoning." You know how dogs eat grass when they don't feel good in order to make themselves throw up? Well apparently he was rummaging through my neighbor's yard and ate a ton of grass from a compost pile. Enough grass to almost kill him instantly (grass is toxic to dogs). He can't walk but luckily he still seems to be eating and drinking normally. I took him on a 4 mile hike the other day, he was perfectly happy, and now it kills me to know that he might possibly never be able to hike ever again...  Just as I was ready to start packing, my road trip to South Carolina got foiled. Un-fucking-believable. My friend who I was going to stay with needs to attend a funeral Thursday night and Friday in Atlanta, so that screwed everything up. I am so bummed, angry, and disappointed.....  Later I met up with Bob, Andrew, Nick, and Xavier at Bleachers where the lovely Kate Tooma hooked us up with free food and drinks. Talking with my friends definately made me feel better. I don't know what I'd do without them. Plus, Katie told me I might be able to go down to Seaside Heights with everybody for after-prom. Awesome!  I hope this weekend makes up for today's shittiness.  -BIGsmut :(
