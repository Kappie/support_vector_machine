That leaves the dude that's from a perfect circle and a drummer who is not dave grohl.  Oh and J. HO.  Which I guess is ok cause Queens is Homme's band, its just that him with Satan screaming (and his increadibly adgile basslines) made the music interesting.  We'll see what happens.  OH and let me say that error messages that blow up your computer are (in my book) completely and utterly awesome.
