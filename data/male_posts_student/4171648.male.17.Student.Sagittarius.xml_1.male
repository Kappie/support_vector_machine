Got ANOTHER test booked for Saturday 18th September at 8:40 in the morning so hopefully the roads will be empty and it will be 3rd time lucky. Also gives me a much needed opportunity to pass before Tom! Costs 48 pounds instead of the usual 35 on a Saturday though so if I stop posting on here its probably because we can't afford our phone bills. On Thursday I got to go the David Giles' album release night at The Dry Bar, Manchester- posher than the average pub and seemed to have a revolving roof by the end of the night ;) Friday morning was most definitely the morning after the night before but I made sure I recovered in time to go to The Railway Inn in Greenfield- cosy little pub, not quite as good an atmosphere though- lack of hecklers may have been something to do with it! On the way back to James' house I was (un?)fortunate enough to meet the inspiration for  urlLink http://www.chavscum.co.uk/  I'm really tempted to buy the Von Chav t-shirt from their shop. If you prefer political satire though then you need to look at this website (an imitation of Labour's brilliant plans in case of a nuclear attack)  urlLink http://www.preparingforemergencies.co.uk  Hope you all have a good weekend but make sure you don't forgot to buy This Charming Man an anniversary card.
