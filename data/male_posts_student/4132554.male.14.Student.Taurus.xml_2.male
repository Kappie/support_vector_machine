And, the test barely touched those topics.. It was all about potato!!   POTATO - We were asked to draw a slice of potato when soaked in different solutions!!Man!! We are living in th 21st centrury!! Would it help if every Filipino citizen knew the answer? Would it feed the hungry? Would it shelter the homeless? Would it improve our economic status??    Then came along technology, it was not that hard, I finished the test more or less in 40 minutes.. I spent the reamaing minutes sleeping.. ZZzzzz...  In breaktime, I went to my locker to get my Geometry book.. And I heard my classmates memorizing the "panatang makabayan".. I thought that it was included in our test so I joined the mini-conference.. Came to think of it, why do they have to revise the pledge of allegiance? It would only confuse the students who have already memorized the first version.. I mean, they hardly changed the meaning..  Then came values ed.. It turned out that the "panatang makabayan" is not included.. Instead, they've included the vision-mission statement.. We were ask to sort out the values shown in the following statements, values that are mentioned in the vision-mission.. I took me a while to finish that portion., I'm not really sure if my definitions of righteousness and propriety are correct..  PROPRIETY - pro路pri路e路ty - noun  1.  socially correct or appropriate behavior: conformity to the standards of politeness, respect, decency, or morality conventionally accepted by a society   2.  quality of being socially appropriate: quality of displaying behaviors thought to be correct or appropriate    Righteous - right路eous - adjective 1.  strictly observant of morality: always behaving according to a religious or moral code   2.  justifiable: considered to be correct or justifiable    Whatever!! All I know is that I hate our values ed teacher!! She enjoys seeing other people suffer.. She's a freak!!  Potato, Propriety and Righteousness - put them all together and I will explode!!
