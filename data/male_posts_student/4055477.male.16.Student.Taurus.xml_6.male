Didnt do anything too special.. Grocery shopping (which took up the day)... Sometimes it amazes me how much we can fit in the trunk of a little 04' sonata..      --It felt good being around everyone again without someone on the phone, out clubbin, or too moody to have a decent conversation with.. We got to do some of the old things again.. ( paging eachothers name over the loudpeaker, throwing frozen carrots... Fun fun..) Even my little nephew got in on the action..    K, maybe I dont have the most normal of families, but I still love 'em..
