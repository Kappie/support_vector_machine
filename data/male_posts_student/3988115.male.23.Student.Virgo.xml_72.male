While cruising through life's journey this afternoon, I have encountered mold and a crazy lady shouting while carrying what might have been all her worldly possessions on wheels behind her. I didn't catch all of this one sided conversation but I did hear her shout angrily about a girl asking her for a dollar but she didn't have a dollar and the girl should have just asked her mother for it. But...there was no girl. There was however a very concerned citizen who was kind enough to suggest someone do something about her. Unfortunately, she exited the building just as it was getting interesting.
