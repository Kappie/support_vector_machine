She doesn't see that now, maybe she will.  Who knows.  It's almost as if I don't care anymore.  Sarah's right.  We're both different people.  If she wants to bitch about Sean, it's her perogative.  If she wants to hook up with random guys, I can't judge.    Whatever, fuck it.  I'll talk later.  -Mike "They were to weak, to prone to break. their needs to deep, their skin to thick by now you took what was to take, tear it apart and start again."
