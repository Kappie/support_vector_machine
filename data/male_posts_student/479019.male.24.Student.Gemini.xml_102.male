I managed to get copies of stuff on  Blockade  from the  Catholic Worker  and  The Nation  and I'm going to get stuff from the  Motion Picture Hearld  on Thursday from the Herrick Library. My paper is progress really well and I'm having fun with it.  Things I need to work on my paper:   The production of the movie.   Write more on the story and plot.   I need to work more on the Catholic far-right's attitudes on the film. I've pretty much done it all for the Catholic left and center already.   Work on the Left's attitudes more. I've got some stuff done though. More is needed.   Write up stuff on general criticisms of the film in the mainstream media. That should be kind of complicated, seeing is how I have so much stuff.   Write about what's going on in the movie industry at the time. Trusts and censorship as limiting factors of controversial themes in films.   Conclusions and thoughts.    There's still a lot to do as you can see. That's so easily an additional 9 pages. Most likely it will be more.  In rotation right now is  Nerd Herder 's  How To Meet Girls  (2001).  ****
