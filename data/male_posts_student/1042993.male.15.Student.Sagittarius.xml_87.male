But, my blog is still here and it will be my main source of communication.  I cancelled because I only had 1 MySQL account which was utterly stupid.  I also found another hosting company for $65 / year and I would get 3000 MB storage (3 GB), 40 GB Bandwidth, UNLIMITED MySQL accounts, UNLIMITED email accounts, UNLIMITED FTP users, Linux or BSD Server.  With IX I got 1500 MB storage (1.5 GB), 10 GB Bandwidth, ONE MySQL, 1000 Email, 1000 FTP, Linux Server.
