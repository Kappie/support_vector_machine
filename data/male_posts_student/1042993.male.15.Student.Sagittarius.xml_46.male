By firing all employees in the San Francisco (headquarters) sector, he will be allowing only 100 positions to come back ONLY for people willing to relocate to the new G4 + TechTV headquarters in Los Angeles, CA.  Comcast has single-handly managed to ABSOLUTELY DESTROY AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF TECHNOLOGY ENTHUSIASTS....  TechTV has been my ONLY resource for satisfying my technology needs for the past 5 to 6 years.  Now it's all gone.
