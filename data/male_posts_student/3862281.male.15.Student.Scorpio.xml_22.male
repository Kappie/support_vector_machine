Can't wait actually, am going to Jersey to stay with my sister (Lorie) for a week and get some much needed sun, was a blast last time I went so am looking forward to it. Went to Alton Towers before too, quite recently in fact (the Wednesday before last I think, give or take a week) but my other sister (Frances) is coming back to England with me and she wants to go to Alton Towers again so I'm tagging along. So this holiday is looking to be one of the righteous times of my life (big woo for me) and I say a 'temporary sayonara'     to the small group of people who actually read this blog (judging from the different names in e-mails and comments and things I'm up to a grand total of 7 readers! >_   to everyone else just because I feel like it!  Hah, my first go at pictures in a post, think it turned out alright don't you?  Apart from the pictures ofcourse, I'm not exactly a master photographer.  Isn't techonology wonderful?  I can swear at people across the world without leaving my seat!
