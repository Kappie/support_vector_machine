However, that does lead Tyke to something he will say later.  10 o'clock was once again the wake up time for Tyke.  Tomorrow will be different though.  After getting up Tyke ate food and watched tv until about 1.  Then he called Tina to see if she was free at night but Tyke had forgotten that the birthday party for Ekul was tonight so she of course was busy.  But that's ok, at least she was excited to talk to Tyke.  After that Tyke left and went to run his errands.  He drove out to Preston to return the mail keys for their old post office box.  Now all the first-class mail that gets sent there will be forwarded to Tyke's current house.  Then he came back to town and went to BECU again to get his checking account established.  But their computers were down so Tyke then had to just work around that and deposit some money while he was at it.  About $400 to be more precise.  Then he went to Starbucks and got his new favorite drink there, strawberries and creme with whipped cream.  Basically it's just a strawberry milkshake.  It tastes really good.  This brings Tyke back to the thought he touched on earlier.  Fiiiine girls.  The girl that was working the cash register was quite pretty.  She had a striking face which is really what guys are drawn to, or at least Tyke is.  The head on a girl is the most important, brains and face.  She was probably new there but she didn't exactly have everything under control.  But you know what?  Nobody seemed to care.  None of the customers were getting upset with her and Tyke certainly had patience (although he does anyway) with her.  Maybe this was just a coincidence but Tyke thinks that the fact that she was beautiful probably doesn't hurt her.  It turned out later on when Tyke got dinner he ran into another good looking girl working but she at least was pretty competent with her work.  However, she did almost forget to ask Tyke to pay before she gave him his dinner at the drive-thru window.  This helps to show that being good-looking sure doesn't hurt your chances in life.  But annnnyway...Tyke got a haircut after his S  Then he watched the graduation DVD cuz he found it on a table and fast forwarded to try to see how often he was in it and you know what...not that often!!!  They cut out at least 3 times where Tyke was staring straight at the camera and he knows he was on the big screen at Safeco.  He still had one good stare that they caught though.  But they didn't show his spin move when receiving his diploma either but that wasn't that obvious.  After that he got dinner and then eventually took out the trash and then went out.  He picked up Macaroon at his house and then went down to Bannerwood Park to watch Kinker's baseball game.  They got there after 9 runs had already been scored for Kinker's team but oh well it was still fun for Tyke to come out to a game as he hasn't been to one in forever.  Macaroon didn't seem to think it was that great but he's not a true baseball fan like Tyke.  If you go to a baseball game and you're a true baseball fan you will at least enjoy the fact that it's baseball you're watching.  Come on...baseball=awesome.  Then after that they went up to Dr. Phil's house and got a poker game going with those three, Dr. Phil's dad, Amed, and K-caj later on.  Tyke played well from the beginning and was pretty powerful or at least in good shape up until his all-in decision where he really just lost the hand flat out.  But he only lost $5 so it wasn't a big deal.  He still got the 10 that Macaroon owed him from yesterday so he still made 5 today.  Then Tyke came home and blogged and guess what tomorrow is...wisdom teeth surgery.  Yay!  Hopefully it won't be bad.  Tyke hasn't really thought about it at all and still isn't really thinking of it.  He doesn't expect it to be bad and he's looking forward to people hopefully coming over to visit him after he's done.  But if they don't that's ok.  It's not like Tyke is leaving for college in a little over a month.  Oh wait...
