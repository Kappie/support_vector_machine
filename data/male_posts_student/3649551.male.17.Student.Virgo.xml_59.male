No, this particular post will serve to reflect on my wonderful ability to make an idiot of myself. You see, I'm a guy. And as a result, girls occupy a certain portion of my thoughts. Well, I usually keep it to one girl at a time, but you know what I mean. After returning home from the trip, I wasted no time in demonstrating my uncanny skill to repulse women. When I'm attracted to a girl, I just up and tell her. It's just my style. It hasn't served me too well so far, as I've been rejected every time, but I think that's just who I am, not what I do.  There was this girl with deadly green eyes that I got to know better while on the trip. Yes indeed, it was once again time to cause myself unnecessary pain. The bottom line is I was, once again, rejected, and shall remain alone. It's terrible how some girls can reject you so subtly and kindly. It's just enough to give you false hope, but not enough to give you any real hope for a relationship. I didn't initially plan on writing about this crap (girls), but shoot, I might as well. This is what people come to these sites for, right? Some stupid teenager bitching about the opposite sex? People will lap it up. Anyway, I think this is the world's way of reminding me that monks still exist. If it becomes too much, I'll just shave my damn head and wear some of those stylish robes. And a cloak. I've always wanted to wear a cloak. No, it's not that bad. I'm far too used to rejection to be too affected by it.
