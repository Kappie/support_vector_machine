There were also some weird stuff like in there like sneaking into a military installation, using a weird bathroom, get stuck with a needle, etc.  Also I need to stop having NPR be my wakeup on my clock radio... my sense of reality is really blurred when I'm just waking up.  I'm listening to  Bad Religion  Christmas songs.  ***
