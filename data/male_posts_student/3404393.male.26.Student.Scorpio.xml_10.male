He mentioned Michael Moore (it was all over then, as you well know if you've read the micael moore post) and the 'gun problem' in the U.S.  Now, I have to admit that my friend had a valid point - take the guns away or outlaw them, and deaths attributed to guns should go down. Granted - however, Americans have this little thing called individual freedom and even if they don't ever want a gun, they like the idea they can buy one if they feel it's necessary or decide they do want one.  That being said, assume we outlaw guns and take them away from all American citizens - what have we actually done? We've fixed a side effect to the actual problem. Let's remember that guns don't pick themselves up and shoot somebody randomly. The responsibility lies with the person who shot the weapon.  Okay, you say, what if it was a kid and they didn't know better? Good question, but I have a better one. What was a little kid doing with a gun? If they are in an environment (I'm assuming their home) and they find a gun, geez - all I can say is that the parents themselves (or whoever brought the gun in the home) should be shot. *that was a pun by the way*  Whoever buys and brings a gun into a household has the responsibility to make sure that any children in the house either:    a)Have no possible way of getting ahold of that gun.    b)Are educated on what a gun is exactly and the seriousness of it AND putting it away so that they have no possible way of getting ahold of it.  If you don't do this, you are responsible for what happens.  But wait! you exclaim, what about what you said about how each person is responsible for their own actions??!  A kid doesn't know that fire burns until he/she touches the flame. Likewise a kid doesn't know a gun kills unless you tell them (even then they might not understand) or he/she has the unfortunate experience of using it to kill someone.  But wait! you exclaim again, how do you know when a kid becomes 'responsible'??   That's the million dollar question. I know teenagers that are more mature and responsible than some 40 year olds, and vice versa. I think this is dependant on the person and there is no perfect age or solution to discover when a person is responsible or not unless you really know them.  Of course, if each person in the world took true responsibility for all their actions, this would be a mute point - but no such utopia exists yet...
