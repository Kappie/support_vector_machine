Well as for vball practice, i guess we are playing Montebello in the 1st round, so that will b interestin...then today i totally passed like shit...it was horrid, then at tryoutz i seemed to calm down and jus take it easy...so yeah, i think i lost a bit of confidence in my passing and serving...so i jus need to get my confidence back and jus relax when im bein pressured to pass it well...as for my love life...fuck it...payce.
