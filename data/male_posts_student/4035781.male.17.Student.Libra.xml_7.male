This is blog is simply going to be an outlet for the thoughts, feelings and desires that I need to express. Let it be known I am by no means am I touchy feely like this in real life, I just a lot going on and now that highschool has ended clicks that have existed for nigh forever fade away and brand few ones come into being. On that note, my best wishes to my best friend Mike who is currently undergoing basic training in St. John's; so that he might be an officer in the Canadian military one day. Yes, clicks do fade away, some people fade out of scene, falling out of touch - and trust me I have tried to make sure that wouldn't happen. Despite my best efforts it has happened.Other's like myself push forward, forming new clicks and being accepted into already formed ones. Now I find newfriends on the forefront of my thoughts whilst others drift further away on the winds of time. Call me melodramatic if you must; however,this is how I sound in my head right now. It is not often one is given a glimpse into the mind of another, a gift to those who seek it.Towhoever may end up reading this I hope you appreciate this fact. It is funny what you think about when you have spare time. This summer has been so busy with "love, life and duty" as I am so fond of saying when asked what I have done with my summer. Thoughts such as these have been the product of such spare time... I sound like an old man *laugh*; it is good to be young. It is often said the young are full of hopes and dreams. I can only I live my life filled with hopes and dreams such as I have now. I can only attempt to live every day as if it is my last, without regret, hesitation and with an open mind and heart. This has led to some major changes in the past few years of my life and you know what? I wouldn't do a single thing differently. How many people can honestly say that? I count myself among one of the lucky few.  This signals the end of my first rant. It felt quite rewarding I must say.   D
