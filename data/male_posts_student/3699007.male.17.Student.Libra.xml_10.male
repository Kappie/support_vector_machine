The name, Tales of Ordinary Madness, is the title of Warren Haynes' first album. A  blog , mind you, not a stupid Xanga site that high-school girls write on about their love lives that change seemingly daily.  Hey bitch, I don't care what you did with some guy that was lame enough to do it with you.  Some of you may be able to figure out exactly who I'm talking about.  Blair especially.  Anyway, my purpose in creating this blog is that I love to write, and I don't really care what it is about.  It will most likely turn into a chronicle of what I did every day, with a few thoughts on some issues thrown in.  I hope it is interesting enough for me to have at least  some  readers.  Anyway, today, Ashley, Britt, and myself went to Lennox Square, which we have all agreed is the best mall in this state.  Mall of Georgia pales in comparison.  Britt's ability to shit money never ceases to amaze me.  We walked around in Rich's and a few other stores for a while and he decided he wanted something Polo, so we went to the Polo store.  Ashley wanted him to try on a pink shirt for the hell of it, basically so I could take a picture of him in it with my camera phone and we could laugh our asses off at a later point in time.  He refused.  Finally, we were helped by a gentleman named Arthur.  NOTE: If you ever go to the Polo store at Lennox, ask for him.  He is badass.  I will explain why in the following sentences.  Anyway, Arthur walks up and finally convinces Britt to try it on since we had come all the way from Lawrenceville to Atlanta and he may as well at least try something on.  An hour and a half later (After he had tried on about 10 more shirts), Britt made the decision that he wanted the pink one.  Now, back to Arthur.  This guy stood there and talked to me and Ashley for the entire time and got us cokes and overall he is awesome.  So anyway, he spent $80 on one shirt that he said he wouldn't even try on.  Hilarious.  Now he doesn't like it.  Then, we left Lennox and went back to Britt's house.  I had a quiz and a test today for online (Yes, I failed Algebra 2, 2nd semester and I am retaking it online), so Britt helped me with both of them while Ashley laid in the bed and made lewd sexually enticing comments towards me, to which I did not yield to.  HAHAHA, so now I just got home and I'm going to start on some more homework I have for online so I can get it out of the way and go out with Britt again tomorrow.  I need a job.  Damn you American Eagle.  Thanks for telling me you'd call and you never did.  Side note: I wish I had half the money the people at Lenox Square do.  One guy in the Polo store spent $2,000.  The general categorization of Brookwood is that we are rich white kids.  Compared to the majority of the kids at Lenox, Brookwood people have nothing on them.  Ok that's all, I'll write in this thing again at some point in the near future.
