It seemed to me that it was also pokey old people day, it was so annoying, I'd be trying to walk down an aisle and BAM! Old person taking their merry time to move, and they were everywhere, clogging traffic with their slowness. And to top it all off, these same slow old people would start poking and pushing you to get you out of the way when the odd time came up that you were stopped and they wanted to go. So during my frustration I thought of a brilliant idea, we could use old people as an alternative fuel source! I mean, we could grind them up and burn them for energy thus we have a renewable resource for fuel. And then I thought "why stop there" why don't we kill two birds with one stone, world hunger AND over population. We could take all the baby boomers send them to a slaughter house and then take all the meat from them and feed it to the homeless. I mean, it would solve so many problems, no more hungry homeless people, no more old people clogging traffic and stores, and no more retired people making the younger generations pay for their pension. And just think of the money saved in the health care system without all those prosthetic hips being needed.  -Matt
