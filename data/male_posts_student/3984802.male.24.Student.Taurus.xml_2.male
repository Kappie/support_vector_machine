I finished transcribing one of the sessions, the one with Steve. Fourteen pages. Unfortunately when I got back to work after history class I was informed that Masha had accidentally deleted the whole thing. Ouch. So we get to do the whole thing over again. Of course I felt really bad because she felt so bad about it. Things were just not going well for her today. I actually saw her cry. I guess she did something wrong at the lab... forgot to give the cells sugar. So they haven't been growing for two weeks and now they are throwing them all away. She was pretty upset. That is one interesting difference between men and women. They cry so much easier than we do. I suppose they are just more sensitive than we are. I think it makes us love them all the more.  I played some softball tonight. Hadn't done that for a long time! It was actually pretty fun. Met this girl that lives in my complex who is from Staines, England. That's right, my old stake. Small world, huh? It was pretty fun to talk with her for a few minutes and remember. Man, I would love to go back and visit. Sometimes I really feel homesick for England.  We had a pretty good rainstorm roll through tonight. There was some nice lightning. Is there anything cooler than watching a huge, brilliantbolt of lightning streak across the night sky? Ifthere is, then please tell me because I'd like to see it.
