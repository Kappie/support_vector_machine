Now, you have to be thinking,"What can move  Kent  so much that he will come out of retirement and update?"  Well the answer... Just read the title damn it!  I never, in my entire life, thought I would get to know anybody well enough that I would actually miss that person a lot when they're gone.  This year I met five of them.  I don't need to name any names, they know who they are.  What are we supposed to do next year with out you guys?  Who am I supposed to walk to class with?  Who to I talk to during lunch?  Who do I hang out with during band trips(yeah, I'm a band geek)?  It's just not going to be the same with out you guys.  I think that I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions.  Actually, it's pretty easy because I have the emotional level of a rock.  Most people have never seen me in a state of being besides happy, bored, and tired.  That's because I keep them bottled up inside me, like every other loser out there.  Since only people that actually know me will even consider reading this, you, the reader, know that I don't have a whole lot of friends.  I'm a loser, like I've said every day for the past couple years.  I'm not afraid to admit it.  In fact, I dont care.  I may not have many friends, but I have true friends.  I just want to thank those five people for making my junior year a fun, interesting, and memorable one.  Even with my terrible memory, I'll remember this year, it's doubtful that next year will even come close to the fun of this year.  Also, congratulations, be sure to come visit.  You know where to find us.  - Some loser   "He who has many friends, has no friends." - Aesop
