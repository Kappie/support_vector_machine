They dialated my pupils and I was like, "Yeah, they'll go back to normal in time." Nope. I had to drive home squinting like I had acid in my eyelids. It was so bad I had to make a stopover at Paneras to sit in the dimmness and sip mixed Mountain Dew and Dr Pepper. It was nice, but when I was done I had to get the rest of the way home. Not fun. I had to call in to work to tell them I wouldn't be there (can't drive safely y'know). SO. Here I am, writing this, listening to OoT music. I wish there were more people on AIM.
