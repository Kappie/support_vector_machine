Red top with white bottoms with the occasional white top with red bottoms. Haha. The entire scene was so amusing. It was as though all of us were attending church with a designated uniform. Haha.  And indeed it was interesting to see the church leaders wearing some different, instead of their usual shirt and tie. Haha. Uncle Tiong Howe was in a red shirt and a pair of beige trousers. Haha. That was the first time I see him wearing something different. Usually, it was a blue shirt and a flowered tie. Haha. Then, there is Uncle Thomas. Haha. He wore a red Liverpool jersey. Haha. You'll never walk alone!  After worship, Uncle Tiong Howe led the entire church in a prayer of the nation. The prayer was powerful. I repeat, the prayer was powerful. It was the most powerful prayer I think I ever heard from Uncle Tiong Howe. I've known him for seven years now, and this is possibly one of the best prayers by him. Praise God.  Then, we sang this wonderful song by Hillsongs. Its called "All the Heavens"  Holy holy are You Lord The whole earth is filled with Your glory Let the nations rise to give Honour and praise to Your name Let Your face shine on us And the world will know You live All the heavens shout Your praise Beautiful is our God The universe will sing Hallelujah to You our King  This song really inspired me. It reminds me that I have a wonderful God. Another song that I really love is "To the Ends of the Earth". Its also by Hillsongs.  Love unfailing Overtaking my heart You take me in Finding peace again Fear is lost in all You are  And I would give the world to tell Your story Cause I know that You've called me I know that You've called me I've lost myself for good within Your promise I won't hide it I won't hide it  Jesus, I believe in You And I would go to the ends of the earth To the ends of the earth For You alone are the Son of God And all the world will see That You are God You are God  These two songs really inspired me. I really hope that this songs will impact you just as just as they impacted me.  Btw, I just remembered the significance of 8 August. Haha. Its something quite silly, but I still hold things like this close to my heart. You can say whatever you want, but its still quite significant to me. Haha.  Two years ago, on this very day, I went out on my first date with her. Haha. Has been two years now but it still seemed like it was only yesterday. Haha. I can still remember vividly what happened that day. During that week, I have tried asking her out for lunch, but each time she told me that she was busy. No, she wasn't lying. She was really busy. A few days later, she passed me this little note, which I still have it now.  In that little note, she said sorry for not being able to make it everytime I asked her out. So, she suggested that we could go out on 8 August, after our national day celebration. Haha. Upon seeing that note, I was so happy. I immediately called her and ask if she was interested in catching a movie as well. Throughout the entire conversation, I felt so nervous. I was so afraid that she would say no. But, thankfully, she agreed. Haha. I was so happy when she agreed. No words could ever describe how I felt at that moment.  So, we went for our first date. Went to town, went to almost every shopping mall. From Lido to Heeren to Plaza Sing. Haha. Haha. That was the happiest day in my life.
