Remove from heat and let it cool in the pan until it's cool enough to pull out an egg with your fingers.  5. Let cool on the counter until warm and not hot.  6. Eat while eggs are still warm.  Starting eggs off in cold water and then warming them up to a boil prevents cracking and also ensures that the yolks are cooked through.  The eggs continue to cook after the pan is removed from the heat but do not overcook due to some scientifical things I ain't done understood yet.  See the explanation  urlLink here  if you want.  I did this tonight.  Delectable.
