Got the bus at 11.40, got to college round 12.05, went to geography, Pat wasn't in, on a course or something, so we didnt really have a lesson, then i went and waited for Philip at the main entrance, like usual, then we went and got our dinner, then we wandered round college for a bit, then we saw Andre so we went and talked to him for  abit, then we went to our lessons, i had psychology, phil had a subject review interview, then he could go home after that. So off i trotted to psychology, got there, hardly anyone was in, another psychology teacher came in, he told us that Janet was at a funeral for the day, he set the work then said that as long as we got the work done we could go home. So off i trotted to find Danny, i found Danny sitting down outside, we trotted off to the shops then came back, went in the LRC for a bit, Wendy found us in the LRC, we talked to Wendy for a bit, then Danny and Wendy both had subject review interviews, so off they trotted to where they had them, i though what the hell i'd go as well, seen as it was nearly the end of the day, 10mins to go in fact, we waited with Wendy for a bit, then we went over to the economics room for Dannys interview, i waited outside, saw Mike, so went and talked to him for a bit, Danny came out we all talked for a bit, then Danny and I went to the Young Enterprise meeting, that finished round 5.20ish. Danny got a call from his parents saying that his new place of work wanted him to work that night, so we waited for a bus, Danny got on the 192, i waited for the 191, which came 5mins later. Then hey presto i came home. Didn't get on the 192 partly because it was full up and partly because the 191 means i don't have to walk as far, espically in this darkness.
