Being in elementary school, most of my friends were girls, but as I moved to Junior High, I found three of the best persons I could find. They were my first real male friends: Israel, Armando and Fernando. They were intelligent, funny and totally there for me, most of the time. I think that in the long run I was a good friend, not as good as them anyway, I had issues. As people grow and move on to something new, High school was the point for me to leave them, not that I wanted, but I was the only one going to this other High School. As time passed, we tried to be in contact, but all seem a little too different, specially by my part. As I said, I had issues, I never let someone come too near because I was a closet case. So I started losign contact.  With time, I found Fernando again and we have tried to keep in touch, but he's in Chicago, so aside for the occasional e-mail, there's not much to said. Important point is the fact that our lives are totally different and in really, really different places. Armando is a no find. I don't seem able to reach him. I don't think he even lives in town anyway. But the one I miss the most is Israel. I don't know why... Well I do. He was my very first best friend. He had a similar sense of humor as the one I have. He was cool, and a fine person. For you to understand me, picture it: if I see him now, after all this time without seeing him ( almost 6 or 7 years ), and I propose to go on vacations next weekend, he would say yes and he'll rent the car. That's how easy going he was.  Now my dreams are about him somehow. I am in different places, say at the mechanic, at the store, at the dentist, etcetera, and in some way or in other he's there, smiling and saying we should meet to have a drink so he can introduce me to his wife ( btw, he must be married by now )... Sometimes, the dream is a memory of junior high... LOL, well I never said they were normal.  At the time I was such a dork ( well, still am ) and he was so ahead of me. Ok, to get a sense of how ahead of me he was, if he was gay, he would be transgeder and pregnant... Man I miss them so much. With Fernando, my relationship just turned awkward and a little distant, even at the end of junior high, he started to resent me and I don't know why. With the others I was the one that started to keep distance between us for no reason at all. In fact I have some memories in which I saw them and I just turned around without saying "HI" ... I'm so ashamed of it now...!  When I think in all this people that are asked what they regret in their lives, what would have they done different, and their answer is always "not a thing", I just start to think on them and for me is losing those relations the only think so far that I regret. But in fact keeping in touch with friends is not one of my best attributes, I just don't know how to do it. Sometimes I have this impulse of taking the phone and call Israel's parents and leave a message for him... I want to be his friend again. I would love to be in contact with all my junior high friends and classmates... Those were by far the best three years of my life... A lot of memories, and most of them make me laugh.  So if you know an Israel Aguirre Gastelum, tell him Rogelio Becerra Cifuentes would love for him to send an e-mail to r13639 at hotmail.com... Yeah, I miss them a lot. Anyway I'll leave you, I'll send a mail to Fernando now.
