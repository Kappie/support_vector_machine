Overall, I've had a really amazing day, basically the polar opposite of Jonah's. First period a project I wasn't looking forward to presenting got postponed.  Then in choir, I got a solo from an audition I thought I'd bombed(Laura and Heather got the others, by the way).  In Theatre Arts we broke into work groups of four, except mine only contains two, and the other one is a really hot girl who I don't really know.  In Allgebra II, I actually finished the midterm.  I have absolutely no idea how I did on it, but finishing is a one up from the last test I took in that class. Zach Dzuba played Mandolin for us today.  It was very amusing.  He was borrowing it, but he's saving up to buy his own. Lara. Get. Title. Scheme. NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  SQ(u)EE!
