That was a rather unpleasant way to get up, but I'm used to it.  All day after that we did stuff like decide what clothes to pack, gather stuff to take and argue about pointless stuff.  Our house has no air conditioning so I had to run out and get my dad from work and we were outfrom 17:30 to 20:00.  That's 5:30 to 8:00 PM if you don't speak European.  Soon after I ran back out with my mum to look for more clothes to take with us.  I didn't get back until 23:30.  That's 11:30 PM if you don't speak European.  That was it.  That was my day.  If I have time, I will make my next album review.  I will review  Kalmah 's  Swamplord .
