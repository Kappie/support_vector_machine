When your in grade 10 and eleven you hear people talk of the change essay, it sounds like it is the most important part of school life in year twelve. And now it is gone. no more change essay. I suppose the bored of studies thought it would be ironic to get rid of "change" right at the beginning of a massive change.  Isn't the irony Delicious ?
