I joined and it took awhile to get started but finally people were like ripping each other apart. Josh and Matt kept saying Gabe was a really good rapper and he got targeted in this one guy's rap. So everyone thinks Gabe is this extremely good freestyler and they tell him to go and instead of saying anything he starts blaring this old diva-type song with a really funky rhythm. I was laughing so hard I was crying. A few battles later and after Ryan joined, he decided to tell them I'm really good. So I start talking on the mic and they all want me to go. In the meantime, Matt wants to scrim and gives me the ip/pw so I join and then the guy that I was going against started rapping and he was really good. OK I'm still in a scrim on CS now but it's my turn. I have no clue what to do so I sit there for a few seconds... then I just start singing an old Spice Girls song that I shouldn't remember the lyrics to. They all laugh at me and RYAN haha starts singing along and thats the last thing I heard before I got banned from the server. I'd still say I won my freestyle battle, so 'you'd better recognize.'  CPL Finals  SK got totally destroyed by EYE, so I guess it's cool that there are new champs but I wish the US would bring it home.  Jason and Tommy and Carl get home WEdnesday, we can finally get nLk started. I'd say I'm not doing too bad for being inactive for a few months, I've been putting a lot of frags on the board.  I hope everything goes how you want it to go if you've figured that out yet, I hope he knows what he wants and you're happy in the end.  Good night, people.  Also, I was looking around my whole web/programming directory and I found some of my old Java work and realized how HORRIBLE of a programmer I was just a year ago.  I mean, who needs the 2 while loops to check for a win in tic tac toe when you can write 8 separate if statements amounting to at least 3 times the work that would've been done on the loops? I'm thinking since I know the general syntax I might be able to teach myself the rest of Java.  I've also been like literally absorbing the whole PHP functions list in an attempt to be a better coder.  If I'm bored enough tomorrow I'm gonna make a web-based FTP client cuz I'm cool.  Oh yeah, that and because the IRC module for PHP is not free (probably isnt too hard to crack though.)  Yeah either that or just write random scripts and make them come together and do something useful.  Only one person I know will have any idea what site this is a ripoff of:   urlLink JoshTeam   I'm just going on and on and on.   Ryan can play some mean Celine Dion.  We made hamburgers at 5 in the morning yesterday.  I HATE HAPPY COUPLES stupid commercial.  John Grisham writes good books.  The school overcharges for yearbooks.  I have a sound curse on my computer!  1 soundcard hasnt worked, 1 was way too low and before that just decided to randomly stop working and come back.  3 pairs of broken headphones (2 of which I did NOTHING to.)  1 pair of broken speakers (Ok I admit I broke those.)  Sean came over and spent the night 2 nights ago.  Every time I look over at my dresser and see the trendy green cover of the book I smile.  Dashboard Confessional is a good band.  I have a sad life, don't I?  --Aaron
