Its a beutiful thing.  Staying up this late to watch late night cartoons.... Not necassarily the best idea. But fun.    I am a happy little nerd today, because I finally found someone to work with me on a comic.  Not going to pull out the big gun yet (Save that for the Big Two), but this first project should do more then good enough to provide us an example for an interview.     Dumbest. Movie. Ever. But im sure it'll be hilarious.  www.haroldandkumar.com
