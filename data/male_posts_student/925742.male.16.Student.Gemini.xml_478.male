I think I'm gonna just use a timechart to display what I've been doing:  Wednesday:  Greg was over, and we had the grip of fun, and Alex can attest to that.  I showed him some games and we did some stuff. He stayed the night.  Today, in PE I twisted my ankle.  Yeah, and I was walking all day on it.  Alex and I did duo improvs. Eh.  I went to work on my ankle, and we actually finished a huge moving job.  But that aggravated my ankle, so now its wrapped in medical tape and my brother put chinese oil on it.  Well, I can put this here for now.....
