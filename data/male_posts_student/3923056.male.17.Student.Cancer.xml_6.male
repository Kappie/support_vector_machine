Let me  outline my findings so far:   Firstly, if we look at the world around us, from everything big to everything small, it is extremely hard to accept the idea of evolution - that everything we see and are, is just a result of random chance. In fact, chance would be slim. I read somewhere (this is just personal reading) that the probability of the universe being created like this was 10^592. According to some dude's law of probability (name started with B), anything over 10^50 is virtually impossible. So that would point to a creator, correct?   For example, look at atoms. Scientists have actually yet to discover what is it exactly that holds all those same-charged protons in the nuclei of atoms together. As we know, protons are all positively charged, wouldn't that mean that they would fly apart? But they don't. Scientists attribute this force to something called the "strong force" or the "big force" - more technically known as "gluons". What is it? We don't know. We can't see it, nor feel it, nor touch it, nor taste it, nor hear it. It's just there.      This is all i'm gunna post for now.....comments would be much appreciated....part 1 of many to come.      meanwhilst.   signout: Wez [undignitary]
