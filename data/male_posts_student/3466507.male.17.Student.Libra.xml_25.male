Well, my mum wanted me to study law and I wanted to see what it was like, so I got attached to the firm for a week. I do't think I will get paid. Never mind, the experience is a kind of payment in itself.  I went conveyancing yesterday and today I went to court. I didn't get to see the judge though, because it was an in chamber case. Just my luck, haha. For the time being I am free. I just finished translating a legal document from Malay to English. I can't tell what the document is about though, because it is all confidential. My apologies.  Work here is quite interesting. I read one of the files yesterday, which is under litigation. Litigation is supposed to be one of the more interesting parts of practicing, as compared to conveyancing. I think we have a strong case and a high possibility to win that case.  I'll be leaving this firm end of this week, sort of unwillingly because the people here are nice and fun, partly because there is a German chick who will be attached here for two weeks at the end of this month. (Hey, give me a break, okay, I am a straight guy after all, unlike SOME people whom I know.- just kidding!)  I hope I get to learn lots at this firm. I might just come back here and work if and after I get my law degree. Wish me luck!
