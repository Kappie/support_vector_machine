I barely know any Seniors (why do I capitalize "Senior"?). They gave their speeches. They got their diplomas. People in the crowd went wild with glee and occasional ditsy-ness.   One of the few virtues I hold in high regard and even consider myself to have is empathy. I felt nervous with the Seniors. They go on to the future, a world beyond what I am at now. I envy them. This world is boring and pointless now. I hope that will change during the summer...
