Wednesday 27/7 2004 Chapter 1: Boringness  im just talkin to Meg and Rebbeca on MSN messanger and They are bored to...EVERYONES SO f***ING BORED!Now im so bored im resorting to playing neopets ( urlLink www.neopets.com ) which is full of really annoying Animals that make annoying noises and get really evil eyed at you if you dont feed them(i know from expierience) and im playing this game called Mootix drop. the idea of the game is to fall from the sky and barrel roll through hoops that are some how suspended thousands of feet up in the air(kinda dumb if you ask me) and eventually you land on a target that someone glued to the back of a giant sheep.I know its dumb but im addicted to the games and im creating an evil army of neopets i have 1 called omen_of_death and another called satanz_best_friend and my 3rd is called Satan.Finnally my cousin Michael signs into MSN messanger and i think im saved but think again. Here is our recent conversation: Silent Bob = Me Im a dumass= my cousin  im a dumass says:hey Bob silent Bob says:sup cuz Im a dumass says:s*** all m8 Im a dumass says:u Silent Bob says:just posting some stuff on my website Silent Bob says:http://englishrules.blogspot.com and yeh i know the name sucks  And we kept on talkin about boring stuff for ages and it was boring and thats the end of my boring day.Im gonna go watch T.V.
