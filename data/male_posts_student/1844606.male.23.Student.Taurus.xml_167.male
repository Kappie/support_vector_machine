I don't know why I thought of this sooner, but I absolutely recomend anyone hip enough that has a turntable to listen to LPs at 45 instead of 33.  The best records to experiment with are RUSH, Van Halen, METALLICA Ride the Lightning and Yngwie Malmsteen (or anything fast).  Weezer Blue sounds like punk, ska and soul!  But goddamn if Inagoddadevida isn't the funkiest thing around.  And I don't know if the demons were chased, but my vinyl copy of Pinkerton now plays correctly!!!!!!!!!!!  It hasn't worked since I got it and now, after the exorcisim its perfect. YES!!!  I hope I don't have hw due tomorrow cause this was way too important.
