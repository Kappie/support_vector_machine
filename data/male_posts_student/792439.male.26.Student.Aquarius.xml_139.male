"oprah, i just worry that i'll never be able to live up to my dad. he made life, all i can make is wine and fish. i feel like such a failure. sob!" or even maury povich- "find out the paternity test results, who really is the father of jesus, mary's husband or jehovah, after the commercial break..."
