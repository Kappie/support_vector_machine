I suppose I'll just have to retype it all.  It wasn't that long though so no big deal.  Blah blah blah.  Yeah the wedding was good.  Everything went fine.  The wedding and the reception.  The food was good as well.  I was kind of dumb though I ate while going back to the reception.  But I should be doing homework and stuff.  I need to go pick up my mouse and Xbox at Whit's.  I let her borrow it so she could practice NBA Live 2003.  She needs the practice let me tell you... bhah.  Yeah.  I doubt she can beat me now though.  It's almost like the one weekend I bought Kobe Bryant's NBA Courtside.  I bought the game on Friday and played it all week while my brother was gone, and when he got back, he played me a few times and he couldn't beat me.  I had the game mastered in two days.  Bahahah.  That's kind of what it's like when I play Whit!  She doesn't have a chance!  Bahahah.  But anyways I need to go.  Peace.
