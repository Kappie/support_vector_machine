I guess I'm just tired, but I don't want to fall asleep.  It's a weird kind of boredom, that knows what it wants to do, but doesn't because some deeper emotion that I'm pushing away is finally getting in the way.  Worked on our projected today.  Weird stuff.  Lot of people at Gaia to.  Weird stuff.
