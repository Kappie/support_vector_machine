This woman hates Freedom, Prosperity, and Happiness...unless of course, LIKING those things will help her out in the long run. Get a load of this quote by The Far Lefts sweetheart:    "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you," Sen. Clinton said. "We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good."    Let me reiterate that last line: "We're going to  TAKE THINGS AWAY FROM YOU ON BEHALF OF THE COMMON GOOD " If that isn't at least SOCIALISTIC I don't know what is. What average American wants the government to take more money away from them than they already do? Honestly, think about it! The Government takes at least 10% of your income every paycheck in Income Taxes alone. They then take more out for health care, social security, and any other rediculous excuse to make you poor and miserable. I don't know if I'm alone in this, but when I work hard, I want to get what I deserve, and I want ALL of what I deserve, I don't want the government to take my money and give it to some social welfare program that I disagree with to begin with!  Speaking of Welfare, I think now would be an appropriate time for me to tell you wonderful folks how I feel on that issue. I'll start off by saying that I'm not for the total destruction of welfare, sometimes people need a little help getting back on there feet after something bad happens. It's when people take advantage of the system that makes me mad. When someone is on welfare for more then lets say, 2-3 years, and are totally capable of getting a steady paying job, I say screw them! If they think that everything is going to be handed to them with out them having to do an ounce of labor they have another thing coming! I'm not going to work MY ass off, just so that the government can give it to some lazy, jobless scum bag with 300 kids.   Anyway, back to Hillary Clinton! This woman gives Ted Kennedy a run for his money when it comes to being the most Liberal person in Washington! I can tell you one thing, if she gets into the White House, with a Democratic Senate and House, we are all screwed! Within her first months taxes would skyrocket, welfare and social programs would run everything, and there would be no such thing as an "individual" just the "common good."   I'm going to leave you with this question: Do you want yet ANOTHER Clinton in the White House? Shes not running yet, but she will be in 2008, no doubt about it. Do you want another 4-8 years of scandal, hypocrisy and lies? Think about that.
