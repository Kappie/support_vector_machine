No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart. I...  Keep it locked up inside... keep my distance from your lies...  Cannot express, to the point I've regressed... If anger's a gift then, I guess I've been blessed. I..  this to me seems like what ave's goin through right now ........ i wish you could find a way to make this shizz go away ...... but i'll always be there to help you out when u need it ... ... ... ... ...
