I had a great lunch with a great friend, we talked a lot, and she needed someone to listen.  I listened, and I tried to help with her problems... but I always feel like I'm just a waste of time, that I'm not really any help.  I really want to help and make her feel better, but I'm not always the best person for advice, and so when she comes to ME to talk, I feel very honored that she's seeking my advice, or comfort from me, or my ear instead of someone else's.  I pray for a lot of strength, compassion, and wisdom, just so I won't do more harm than anything else.  Okay, so there was something big to talk about today... but that's not big... that's just life.  Then I went for an eye exam.  It's been a while since I had one of those.... feels good to be able to see better again.  And then I was on my way to a meeting that was cancelled, no big deal there.  And now I'm back home, enjoying a nice relaxing evening while the apartment is empty... (sigh of contentment)
