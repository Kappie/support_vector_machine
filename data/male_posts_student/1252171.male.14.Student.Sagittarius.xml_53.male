So don't try to visit me, because you'll just get lost. I have special abilities you don't have. I use these powers to fight this evil, crazy guy named Mack who builds these weird killer robots. You've probably never heard of these attacks because nobody except the town I live in knows about them. Well, except Gage. Me and my girlfriend are 18.Camo, Katt, Leon, and Hobbes are all 17. Knumchuck and Pheen are 16.  Anyways, today was a  really  boring day. All I did really was play SSBM with Camo, Foxy, and Hobbes while Katt played with a DDR Max 2 kiosk she won in a prize grabber machine (I don't know how that happened either). Knumchuck and Pheen were on the computer and Leon was reading the newspaper. I'll tell you about more of my friends next time. Foxy's tugging on my sleeve to go on the computer. Bye!
