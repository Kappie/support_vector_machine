Work was pretty quiet due to Florida getting a power outtage and the offices there shutting down early. Kind of bad luck for us with it being 2 days into sweeps. Anyway, it's the same stuff I've been doing for the last 11 months, so nothing really exciting. I was very eager to get home!  On brighter side of things (sarcasm there)... now I get to do some more reading on the history of coffee in Asia and Africa! I really need to get that crap done so I can get other crap done. I think that if I get 2 articles finished, then I'll work on my painting.  In rotation right now is the "Before You Were Punk" (1997) compilation.  ***
