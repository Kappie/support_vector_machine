I hope you don't mind a little criticism.. Um, it feels like, to me, you were trying for a rhyme scheme but I don't feel it, also your meter is a bit inconsistant. I mean don't get me wrong the ideas within the poem are great and the poem is good, but it feels like its struggling to be good.  A struggling mind writes a struggling poem. I write what I think and whatever comes at me first. At first, yes I was trying to write a peom that ryhmes for I like poems that ryhme. Yet is it not true that a poem can be whatever it wants to be. That is what many people say so after words, after I reviewed it myself, I decided to leave it how it is. Anyway, think of it this way, I have just thought about this myself. This world is about mankind basically, and it talks about how mankind has grown from a civilized world, as we like to think we are, to a world run by greed and hate. The world has broken up, and now you look at the poem structure and like you have said it has broken up. A broken poem for a broken world, a struggling mind writes a struggling poem, an angry man writes a poem of sadness (Which is mostly the case, right?). Do you understand? Thanks for your comment! :D  Well, now it is time for one of my older poems. Here it is,  I Lay Here ...      I Lay Here
