I will be myself, but is being myself enough or too much. Due to the fact that I have a charismatic character... I'm afraid they feel I'm putting on a facade.  Ok... I've decided to be myself. Blogging is good. I type what I think. But i won't go far enough to call it an "expression". Or is it. ?.  I'm talking to Suriani now. She's very sweet. I like talking to her. Friends are few and far apart. She's one. She cares.  I miss Zel very badly. To the point it hurts. It really does. Not just emotionally, but I feel a physical constriction in my "inside"... I don't know how to put it. The thoughts squeeze me from the inside. Not just anyone knows about my blog. Just my closest friends. So I suppose saying this here is ok.  I have to go now. It hurts.
