There are three things you have to know about Richard: 1. If it's worth thinking, It's worth saying. 2. He's from Texas. 3. He is the local drama expert, and gossip king.  Basically, Richard's idea of a good CYO Mission Statement is:  "Make Money, Recruit People, Use the Recruits to Make More Money, and by the way, have fun."      So we've got the  richest  CYO in town. But deciding what to do with the money is another story. Enter the discussion about our first meeting.    K, Y'all when's our next meetin' gonna be?     Uh, how bout at the end of August?      How about Labor Day?     That's a retarded idea. Let's meet at the end of August. What're we doing? Bowling!      No.     Not bowling. How about Spoons.     Yes! Spoons is great.     Not spoons...how about Casino night?     No, that's Homecoming theme!     So what?     No casino. Lazer tag!     Yes. Lazer tag!     We discover that lazer tag costs $545 dollars. Big red  X .   Uh...how about spoons?   No. A bigger activity.   How about a carwash?   No!   Softball?   I hate softball.   Dodgeball?   Too sweaty. I'll ruin my hair .  Spoons?   No. Movie?   Heck no. Spoons?   OK .  Sure. But have ice cream.      Geniuses we are: Richard is orange, I'm green, and everyone else is blue.  At any rate. That's our CYO meeting, which is always at a Mexican Place.  Remember: Coloreds is what do our laundry with.
