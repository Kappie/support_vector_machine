It is nice to see some serious thinkers here at Blog just like me though I do not put all my thoughts down here such as he does.  Two of his writings, I must say, did catch my eye. I would like to share them with you here.    Hurry Up  Wait    Sometimes I get frustrated when I have to hurry and do something, only to find that I must then wait for it to be used. I'm starting to think a little differently though. I can see where God is doing, and has done, some things in my life that weren't used immediately. He prepares me, only to make me wait a while before they are used.  Why does He do this? I can offer a theory. He waits to see if I have faith. I may be prepared to do something, but if it is not combined with faith, He gets no glory. He waits to see if I have enough faith to trust His timing, or if I will strive to accomplish something on my own.   God's Control Room     I had the priviledge to be on an aircraft carrier yesterday for a family cruise that lasted 12 hours. As we toured the ship, we entered a 'control room' somewhere deep inside the craft. As we oohed and ahead over all of the computers, screens, radars, gauges and such, the wife of my sponsor said, "This is great, but can you imagine what God's control room looks like?".   What a thought! God controls this entire world (planets, galaxies, etc.) from His throne room, and He does it because He loves us. He could throw us away at any time, but He won't. In spite of what we do, He still wants us.   These two really made me think if there are such reasons behind what happens to us. Me, I seem to have a lot of bad luck come my way ever since I was maybe 13. I don't know why I have such bad luck, I might not have it at all yet I think I do. I don't know. But is God doing this to prepare me for something? If so, what could it be?  When I was younger, I would just lay in bed and think up reasons that may be behind why we are here, what reasons why we believe in God, and things of that sort. So far, I have come up with many thoughts, enough to make me want to right a book even. Yet in this world, such an action would only cause me trouble rather then to help others think.  Joe Cook at  urlLink  Peace 4 U  , this is where the passages came from, is a true person to have such a site. Among many, he is not afraid to share what he believes, thinks, and so on. Yet if you do such things as this off the computer and in the real world, you will find yourself being sued until death.  Some people in this world take such things a religion to far, others do not like Joe. Like the case about the Ten Commandments in front some government building. Other religions demanded that it should be taken down for it is against their religion and that they are not suppose to lay even their eyes upon it or something like that. Well I say, don't look at it! So what if it is not in your religion, this world here was founded by Christians. Like it or not, it stays. No one is forcing you to change religions, and no one is forcing you to look at it. So just move on and leave what we have in this world alone. If you like, put some of yours up!  Do you see? It only takes one person to mess up everything for all of us. Just one! This world is in the dark to far to ever see light now. And people wonder when god will ever come to take us home? Well, he will come when we all realize what we are doing. He will come when we all accept what other believe, think, do, and say. Christians believe that gays and lesbians are sinners for who they are, right? I say that the Christians are sinners for not accepting who they are in their search of happiness. Love comes in many ways people, not just with man and women but with the same sex too. I don't care if your gay or not, your still a person and I respect you for that.  Many don't believe this, but I think that because our world has changed so much that God to has changed to accept this world. That the sayings of god and how he is against gays has now left his mind to accept them. God loves all children, correct? Then leave gays along, for god loves them too no matter who they are. They didn't plan out this action people, God sent them on that road to find love.  Anyway, I am getting to deep into my discussion now. I have to cut off and go get something to eat. Later everyone!     Wolfwood
