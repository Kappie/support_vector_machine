VERY LONG.. since i even decided to post sumthing of inherent interest to the minority group of people out there who actually bother to read this insignificant blog of mine.. (thx btw.. ^^) anywae.. i juz decided 2 blog all of a sudden cos of the pointless behaviour that i have been exhibiting these daes.. i juz feel that im not realli me animore.. i mean.. im still pretty much myself.. making corny jokes.. trying 2 cheer pple up and that sorta stuff.. overreacting pretty badly at times.. and the other stuff that i dare not mention that which whole in whole make up me..     >sidethought   [  actualli.. ive been slping realli late these daes.. instead of being depressed.. im prolly juz burned out/plain tired.. still dunno though.. wanna knoe wat i do that makes me so tired? ask around.. find out 4 yurself.. heh..  ]    still.. i had a great week and week b4.. start with the earliest memory.. last last sat.. went out for a movie.. but then to bore u 2 death.. im gonna include also the timeline of my activity..     >sidethought    [ this may (most likely will..) bore u.. skip this section if u cannot tolerate it.. ]     well.. heres the timeline.. though a rather short one i might add..    1. woke up.. 9.30   2. brushed teeth.. freshened up..   3. skipped breakfast.. didnt feel like it..   4. watched tv!! around 10++..   5. around 10.30 weizhi calls.. tells me that going for movie..   6. quite reluctant since i got stuff to do later and was not really convenient 4 me..   7. decided aniwae.. wat the heck.. juz go.. so.. informed my mom.. postponed the stuff 2 later and left for jurong entertainment centre..   8. took a bus to harbourfront.. halfway weizhi msgs me that change to orchard cine..   9. was pretty glad cos orchard was more convenient than jurong..   10. reached harbourfront.. travelled 2 orchard thru NEL and dhoby ghaut..   11. reached there and rushed the whole 2 km (?) to orchard cine..   12. arrived in time.. saw daryl and jie hui at subway..   13. tried to scare jiehui.. failed..   14. sat down to wait for rachel (changed it liao.. sorrie.. heh..)   15. talked bout stuff with daryl and jiehui.. weizhi tries to sneak up on me..   16. fails.. daryl gave him away..   17. still waiting for rachel (another mistake..   ~hee)   18. still waiting..   19. movie doors gonna open in 2 mins.. still not here.. weizhi climbs to 3 floor for sum unknown reason..   20. while waiting bought a zinger to eat.. (skipped breakfast rememeber?)   21. the group finally decided to juz go up first.. w/o weizhi..   22. at the lift there and suprisingly met rachel (final one..)   23. went into the lift..   24. reached top floor..   25. still waiting for weizhi   26. still waiting.. the girls went to buy food..   27. saw him.. up the escalator..   28. entered movie theatre..   29. thankfully movie started just as we came in..   30. found a gd seat..   31. watched the movie..   32. movie ended..   33. went out..   34. went back home..   35. home sweet home..    thats all of the redundant stuff.. still.. though the movie wasnt 5 star quality.. i had no regrets going.. cos.. quoting one of my friends.. "..actually it's not the movie that counts.. it is who u are watching the movie wif!!" yeah.. so watching wif my friends.. no matter how small the grp was or how damn irritating weizhi was.. (hahaz.. just kidding man.. dun rush over to beat me up yet..) i still had a gd time and was realli glad that weizhi called wen he did..    >sidethought    [ to be  REALLI  honest.. i wasnt feeling like going for that movie on that dae.. was pretty tired especially after the stuff that happened the wk b4.. post-exam stress and all.. so i didnt realli felt like going.. even if she was coming along.. ~haiz.. still.. no regrets.. ]     oh well.. thats that for this insignificant post..
