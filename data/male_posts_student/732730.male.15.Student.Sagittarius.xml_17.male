Anyway, I watched the video of it (available on  your  urlLink Favourite   urlLink P2P   urlLink Client . It wasn't so much gory as distressing, because you can hear him screaming!  Although it seems real at first glance, after reading some opinions on the video, it looks like he was already dead when they gave him the big snip. The Atzlan News Bulliten says that it's a  urlLink fraud . About  urlLink 6,250 other websites  are also reporting the same.  How interesting.
