Mom's gone at the moment.  i think she went to the pottery place to work on these bowls she's makin.  they're actually pretty nifty.  Erik and Karin are bein quiet for once.  well Karin is usually quiet... but thankfully Erik is too today.  earlier he was yellin at the computer cuz he couldnt beat some silly game.  i hate video games.  i KNOW that this house would be alot more peaceful if we would get rid of all these stupid video games he has... i mean for goodness sake he has them on both computers plus his PS2.  and its like when he gets sick of yellin at one he'll move to another.  i mean really... arent these games supposed to be fun?  all he does is yell at them.  and Mom  Dad say they're trying to get him to stop.  i dont think they do so as well as they say.  half the time he's yellin and they just ignore it.  but i dont get it.  whatever.  he's not my kid.  psh... all i have to do is live in the anger he creates.  and i cant correct him or stop him cuz it will just make him mad.  and i'm not his parent so its not my place either.  its a rather impossible situation.  anyways.  VBS starts tonight.  i am a "camp counselor."  its gonna be fun!  take the kids around to the different posts and stuff.  course i think they already have a ton of counselors... it sure seemed like it and i dunno if they're gonna need teams of counselors so i might just end up walkin around with the digital takin pics for the church website.  i wouldnt mind though.  well off to make tortillas.  yum.
