Most people who are reading this prolly know me at least a little bit, but I'm a random idiot who likes anime.  And video games.  And porn--I mean--What?!  My favorite show is Yu Yu Hakusho.  My favorite video game is Final Fantasy IX.  I spend a lot of time on AOL Instant Messager (My SN is FalconFlame16), and on Gaia Online (I have quite a few SNs there, for my own privacy...yes, I'm paranoid).  Now, obviously, some of you out there know more about me than others do.  Keep your mouths shut, hmm?     Well, I think I'm done for today.  I'll use this as a Diary online, just because I know you're all dying to know what random stupid things go through my head...My first "Diary" entry will be tomorrow.  Thought I'd introduce myself today.  Well, baibai!!
