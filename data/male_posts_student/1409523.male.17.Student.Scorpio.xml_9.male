"well you do what you want to ... but i would like it if you come"  .... looking to avoid more crap for the rest of my life i went...... turns out we left too early... church's at 7:30 not 7... great so i sat in church tweaking out with all of this pent up energy.... then mass began and i found myself between having too much energy and falling asleep ... it was quite a weird situation.... either way this could have been the longest mass in the history of mankind (it actually was over and hour and a half).... i felt like i was going to explode by the end... then finally we left... and i didn't even get a thank you for coming .... you know like, "nate.. you made the right choice..." not cool.... then i got bitched at .... i guess you could say im damned if you do damned if you dont!
