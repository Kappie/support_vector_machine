Cloning and genetic manipulation will be the Penecilin of the future. Down this road lies better, longer lives for everyone. And honestly, any experiment done on an animal is fair game in my book as long as the owner of the animal agrees to it. These are not people, and if we have to kill 1000 mice to save one human it is worth it.
