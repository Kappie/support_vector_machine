Like 3 weeks ago my computer for some time had been fed up with viruses and then it suddenly popped after I was done with a bigass homework assignment (thank god).   It went into safe mode and started to screw itself up so we had to fix it alittle bit.   2 weeks later i'm on the computer fixing all the personal setting cause when i cleaned the computer everything was saved but personal settings, so that was a really big pain in the ass.   Now the thing is working much better, though its still got 6 corrupted files with the viruses that we cannot get rid of.   I guess thats my fault.        BTW, for gamers especally for ps, year aniversary was back on may 20th, on the 25th was my full year playing and paying for it.   yay.  oh and the crappy skool year is over.   I'm tired of always saying school was boring when i come home.....cause 99.99996% of the time school is boring.    Gradtuation is on the 10th.    Oshit.  Oh, and whoever stole my money ($30), give it back and i wont fuck you up.  I'll give a $10 reward (lame but eh) to whoever tells me who took it.   What happens, person who stole gets fucked.   (don't be gay here, you know what i mean)   Last but not least, for all that don't know, i have a 10 month year old sister in florida with my dad and stepmom.    Few weeks back i got really pissed at her and talked to my dad.     Now soon we might be disscussing plane tickets.......and there might be no return flight.    A dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest, honestly, its the honest ones you have to look out for because you can never tell when they are going to something incredibaly...stupid.  -Piriats of the Carribean
