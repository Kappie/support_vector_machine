Hempstead, so the coaches thought we didn't deserve to wear our practice jerseys with the Kennedy name on them.  I have NO response to that.  Ahh, yeah.  So practice wasn't 3 hours and 20 minutes, but it was 3 hours and 5 minutes.  Awesome!  We lifted at the end, so that's what made it a bit longer.  That and we decided to do charge drills when I bruised up my right shin muscle, whatever you may call it.  It's sore now.  Yippee.  That and my left calf muscle is still a little sore.  I don't know what to do now.  So after practice my dad and I drove to McDonald's where I ordered and things in my car.  It was interesting.  That was the 1st time doing that in my car.  Having a car is defiantly a milestone in life.  I feel the responsibilities increasing in my life and the complexity as well.  Not only do I have to remember to lock the doors, but roll the windows up and the parking break and and and and... eh!  It seems to me like I'm ranting about these responsibilities that are not hard to take care of but just seem easy to forget and really just things I've never had to worry about before.  The exact things we talked about, my dad and I.  That makes me think of the discussion about technology we had in world history.  The discussion, or debate you may say, was about whether or not the use of technology has improved the quality of life or not.  To be the devil's advocate, I chose the against technology side.  I did that partially because I knew I could make it funny.  I was with Eric and we make an 'OFFICIAL GRAPH' with 'OFFICIAL DATA' on how the use of technology has greatly increased over time the amount of homework assigned.  As stupid as that is, I believe it's true.  If you think about it, I think you'd agree.  Think if the printing press wasn't invented.  Think if the ink and pen wasn't invented.  Think if the use of the rock wasn't discovered.  Where would we be?  We'd be no where, but we'd be no where without homework.  From a different angle I'd say technology greatly increases the complexity of life.  I know this is true and I know you know this is true.  How many Americans can honestly say they don't have a VCR with '12:00' blinking?  Not many, I think.  While technology seems to make people's lives more interesting, it does make it horribly complex.  I seem to think that without modern technology, life would be much more peaceful.  A lot could be said about that, but I don't intend to finish my thought just yet.  Perhaps you've got ideas, and go ahead and comment.  Anyways that was pretty much my day.  I came home and ate my lunch and then Whit came over and we played Xbox.  We played NBA Live 2003 and I kicked butt.  (Sorry but Ray Allen doesn't compare to Kobe Bryant, Whit... he got game, but not that much game, bahah)  Then we watched the rest of  Joe vs. the Volcano .  That is such a great movie, you don't understand.  I mean  I have no response to that .  We then proceeded to attempt to solve my Rubik's cube.  After many failed attempts, she went home and I was left with the cube in my hand and a horrible headache.  Hmm.  It makes me wonder the intentions of this Rubik guy.  I suppose he could be some madman who was only out to give people headaches trying to solve his silly cube.  Hahahahah Rubik.. the jokes on you because I don't care!@#  ...right now, at least.  I will solve that dang thing, and without help from the internet.  And no I won't peel the stickers off!  So there!  Good night.
