My big goofy grin days will either be numerous and plentiful or be snuffed out like a candle in a huricane.  I'm going to have lunch with  her  tomorrow.  I've been given a lot of good advice that I can and can't use.  I've been encouraged by so many people, and it really makes me smile to think that people are rooting for me and cheering me on in a respect.  I'll actually get one last psyche up tomorrow if I need it... and I probably will.  In approximately 11 or 12 hours, I (along with everyone else) will finally find out if this waste of energy has been worth it or not.  I have a good feeling about tomorrow.  No matter which way it goes.  I'm actually looking forward to it.  That hasn't happened before.  Usually I've dreaded it, or been really nervous about it.  I feel anxious, but not nervous.  Do you think I stand a chance?  Feel free to give any kind of feedback on any part of this post.   Lord protect my heart.
