It started at my friend Joe's house, where we got Subway and Coldstone Creamery ice cream (my GOD, is that stuff friggin' awesome), then sat around and played video games.  After that, I drove over to my friend Travis', where we went to Friendly's for dinner and had more ice cream.  I am a fat, fat man on this day.  After which, we watched a few innings of the Mets game, then I left him so he could pack (he's going away on a trip on Sunday), so I went over to my friend Jeff's house, where I dropped off McFarlane figures for him and we watched part of the opening ceremonies of the two week celebration of my birthday, aka the Olympics.  I spent most of the day out doing things, which was a nice change of pace from what I normally do, which is nothing.  Most of those things were eating, and right now, I am feeling severely overweight.  If I was the type to exercise, I would be spending an extra twenty minutes on the treadmill or stationary bike tomorrow, but alas.  Instead, I'll be working.  It's been nice to be away from work for three days, but I'm broke, so...oh well.  I finished school on Thursday, too, making this a great week.  I got an A on my portfolio, then stood up and pretended I was part of a group presentation on how to produce a radio commercial.  I've never really found myself to be the teaching type, so I kind of stood in the background and made wry observations every now and then.  I managed to get an A for Senior Seminar, which leads me to believe that Professor Schmidt was taking this class about as seriously as I was.  Thus ends my return to Monmouth, which has to be considered a total success.  I started there in Fall of '97, and went there for two years.  A D in psychology caused me to lose my academic scholarship, since i needed to maintain a 3.0 GPA (and my GPA topped out at 2.95), so I went to TCNJ.  I failed out of there because I was burned out.  After a year off and a year at a local community college, I went back to Monmouth, where I wound up with six A's, an A-, four B+'s, and a B-.  Not too bad, considering how lousy things had been for me at TCNJ.  Now, with the schooling out of the way, comes the hard part:  finding a job in the radio industry, and not in the pizza industry.  I'm working on that one.  Two weeks from my graduation party, and I can't wait.  I've never even had so much as a birthday party before, so it's exciting to have something in my honour.  It should be a fun time, and another excuse to eat like a slovenly beast of a man.  More updates to come, so keep it here, yo.  And through August, you can still listen to my radio show at www.wmcx.com on Thursdays from 12-3 and Sundays from 3-6, so please tune in and send me feedback.
