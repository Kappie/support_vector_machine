There's really no reason to bother, but you won't hate yourself if you have to see it.  I only saw it because we wanted to see Farenheit 9/11 but it was sold out.  White Chicks wasn't sold out.  Look, it's better than the disaster it looked like it was going to be.  But it's not like it's a good movie.
