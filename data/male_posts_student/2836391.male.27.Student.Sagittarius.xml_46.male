Looking very handsome and trim, 27, house-trained, single, can cook. Free to a good home!    Rachel's New Car  I went with Rach today to help her look for a new car. She was after a Celica, since it didn't look like she was going to get the skyline. We didn't find the Celica, but after some searching, she found and fell in love with an outstanding Mitsubishi FTO. Its a great car, and I'm insanely jealous! (But she says I can drive it sometimes!)
