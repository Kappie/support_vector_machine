So, here's how you do it.  It's really simple, and makes Avant Browser look even better.  1. In order to find skins for Avant, you're going to need to go to www.avantbrowser.com.  You can look for the skins there.  2. Once you find the one you want, you have to download it to the correct folder.  This depends on where you saved Avant Browser when you downloaded it.  3. Once its downloaded, go into Tools>Skins, and select your new skin.  See, that was quick, easy, and makes your browser look even better.   -------------------- Weekly Wrap Up- July 2, 2004  What a week, right?  We looked at some all new programs, such as ObjectDock, Avant Browser, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, MyAlbum, and WinAmp.  All of these products (with the exception of MyAlbum), were outstanding, and definitely deserved to be looked at by you.   In sites, we took a look at GameRankings, GameSpot, 1up, IGN, and Gmail.  Everyone except for GameSpot got a decent review.  In games, we looked at Trivial Pursuit, WHAT Word, Family Feud, Collapse, and Go Bingo.  Again, everything was fine, except for Go Bingo, which I only recommend to people who love the game and want to play for Uproar.  And finally, this week, the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway was announced, along with other daily features such as Mozilla Firefox tips, the first ever bagel.tech war, and an update on Spiderman 2, along with today's tip, how to skin Avant Browser.  The bagel.tech Gmail giveaway is coming soon, so be sure to keep checking back to see if its going to start.  That's all for this week.  Remember, if you're looking for something that is no longer on this page, it's in the archives, and now that we've started a new month, chances are that its probably in the June 2004 section.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for an all new Late Night Bloggin', where I will go and read other people's blogs, and then tell you about it!  And throughout the weekend, I'll have more stuff in there for you.  But, until Monday, adios!
