It's not humid, it's not wet... 4 seasons...long autumns and short winters... Somewhere in the middle of it is a road... Along this road are houses... 20? 30? they are all 2nd storey houses... not 1 or 3 they are of the most beautiful design... yet so simple many with picket fence and some with swimming pool under the clear sky with a few patches of clouds and your standing in the middle of the road... looking past the houses... under the lamp light... looking at the city juz a few mlies any... the crystal clear high-rise walls reflecting the sunset... then you hear a bicycle ring... you turn around to see your son cycling towards you... -------------------------------------------------------- Aww crap...
