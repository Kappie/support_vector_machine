 Mike and Cassie battled Jenny Surrrusco and me in bowling.  After a pathetic sub fifty game, Jenny comes out blessed by the bowling gods and schools us all.  Our team sailed to victory.  Good times indeed, a game for the books.  Now I need to find another bowling partner.  Damnation why do all the cool people have to move away!
