On Tuesday night (night of last post) I went to snowdons, with Kat and Jamie'o and Elliot.. it was a good night :-D, I also had a chinese takeaway- woo!  Yesterday it was me Dads birthday.. we had a meal down the local pub, searched around lennards electricals and stuff for a new telly- £700 for a 32 inch widescreen (why do they still use inches)? and it comes with a DVD recorder! (Philips). I reckon we'll get it. Oh, and put me dads new car radio in, but had to go to halfords for a male->female aerial plug adapter- which was £4 :-O  Ahh well. It's nearly 2:00PM and I haven't left my room! I'm starving, and I think somethings on fire downstairs. Cyaz...
