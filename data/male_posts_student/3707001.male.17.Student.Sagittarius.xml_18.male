Kinda made me wish I got up when I first woke up. O well, that morning the thoughts of 2 nites past were still fresh so I posted. Then I played some WC3. I won twice! Woooot!! Afterwards I ate lunch and talked on msn I believe... I'm not sure. My memory of the time between lunch and work is kinda fuzzy, no offense to the ppl who filled it for me.   At 3:30ish I got in the shower to get ready for my 4-9 work shift. I had just listened to some of Without You - JE so I was feelin their music. As I showered I sang along wit someone in mind ;). I finally got out of the bathroom at 3:56... >.  When I arrived at work I received my new badge. My old was broken and I couldnt punch in or punch out so I had to sign a stupid sheet everytime. I think the fonts uglier on my new one but at least it works. No need for details here, just worked the grocery order. But there were some interesting points to my day. First of all, people were taking part in non-Christian activities. Usually, I would take part as well, but I've been trying to stop lately. After SnoCamp, I stopped, using that spiritual boost from that retreat as my inspiration. 3 weeks later I had started again. But now I've got more to help me out. Whenever I'm tempted I just picture the disappointed and saddened expressions of 2 ppl whom I love so much... just the thought of hurting them is enough to make me stop. For everyone who has prayed for my strength in these matters I thank you.   The other interesting thing at work today was the chocolate milk. This week we got alota things on sale for "Buy 1 Get 1 Free", including that milk. I've gottenit last three times I worked and thethose lastthree nites have not been pleasant. Well, then again when I buy milk it's two 1L cartons and I drink it over like 2.5 hrs. Since it's so heavy I end up not eating anything. I have a theory of how it upsets me, but I'm not gonna get into that. Just remember this:   Chocolate Milk is NOT a meal replacement.    Well, after seeing a friend from school and killing the rest of my shift, it was finally time to go home. But just my luck, it had started to rain hard. Like it was, I believe, the worst rain I've ever walked through. As I walked through the parking lot my socks were getting wet cuz the water level was above my shoes. One of my coworkers offered me a ride home, but being the kinda person I am I refused. I hate inconveniencingothers, but I wouldn't hesitate to help someone out if they needed it. I guess I'm not too humble either cuz I'm talking about Warren the Good Samaritan... but the point is I refused. It's literally a 3 minute walk anyways, so what's the point right? Then again what's the problem wit taking a ride if it's rite there, but still... no. Well in an attempt to keep myself as dry as possible, I used my apron as a hat. Needless to say it was drenched when I got home. Along wit my socks, pants, and both shirts I was wearing. YA! It soaked through my work shirt and soaked my undershirt, all in 3 mins of walking wit an apron over my head. My undershirt is just as thick as my work shirt mind you, so the rain was that bad. Well after hanging up my clothes to dry I hopped on the comp.   My parents were out getting groceries and then called to tell me to order some pizza. Mmmmm... pizza. After ordering I chatted wit Matt and told him of my chocolate milk adventures. Then my parents got home and I carried the groceries up a few flights of stairs. They didnt get much today, mostly cuz they are hardly ever here and we dont eat as a family over a home cooked meal as much as we used to. Well I've been busy too, I been either at work or out wit friends for almost every weeknite since school ended. Anyways, the pizza then arrived and messed up my internet connection. Yes, buzzing me from downstairs DCs me, so just call my cell instead :P. Anyways, pizza filled up the lil space I had left after that milk as I talked to Matt and Will and a lil of Koo on msn.   Matt, get some chocolate milk man!!! You love it as much as I do and today's the last day of the sale!!! If you get 28 cartons then u can drink 2L a day like me!! ^.^   Will, Will, Will... I still dunno how word bout Ada's landing got around to ya. Meh, it's not really important, I just needed something to start off this para. So, the truth is out huh?  **reads msg history**  Ya, I made that promise when I had no control over my feelings. Butas I look back on it now, I still woulda done the same. If I hadn't done it then, then I'd still do it now. Looking back, I can gather the differences between mine and urs. But just cuz I did what I did doesn't mean that u love her less, or that I love her more. I'm just the kinda guy who goes all out on things. But being the drastic person I am doesn't make me any more qualified either...   Actually, I do not prefer Plan A over B. If she's happier wit B, then I'm happier too... I don't care about what happens to me. These 17.5 years of lonliness hasn't been so bad. What's another 60?       "I believe there is a hero in all of us, gives us strength, makes us noble,  even though sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most .‚Äù    -Aunt May, Spiderman 2   I always wanted to be a superhero, guess this is my chance to become one!  Besides, lonliness is not always sadness, cuz her happiness (at least in my heart)overshadows all of that. Don't worry, I will always have Rawlings. Tho I'm sure I'll replace her a few dozen times over my lifetime, shes always been there for me ^.^   Well, thats whats been on my heart lately,   See ya later  Warren   [13] Sorry Martha, I know that I haven't mentioned u in a while, but that doesnt meant that I havent been missing ya!!:P   [10] Yes, don't worry, I'm missing you too...
