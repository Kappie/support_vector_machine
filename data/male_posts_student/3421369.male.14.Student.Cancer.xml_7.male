Stopped at around 1plus..    Then went to library.. Jurong east library..  Actually wanted to look for comics which mr muralli told us.. But realised that i was big enough to appreciate the comics.. So i went to the second floor where the history section was at..    I found a book on ww2 and sat the flipping it.. It was extremely thick.. So i just flip through the pages and study the maps of the war.. While i was flipping the book, a sms came.. I forward to others and continued flipping the book..    At around 3 plus near 4, i wen to jurong point to look for something for jRong.. Coz hes birthday coming.. So i search and search.. Then decided to buy something light for hem.. It was a keychain..
