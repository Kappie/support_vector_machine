She said that while she was gone I should think about all of that and she will too, but until then we're just friends. So for the next 7 days I'm going to be wondering if this break up is final or if i still have another shot. Maybe I should explain some things [even though she won't see this until she gets back]  1). Kendyl    I was interested in getting to know kendyl and I did think she was cute, but in terms of me actually liking her, i don't know if I ever got to know her well enough, but during those times when I was getting to know her I got to know you better and I realized that I was looking at the wrong girl. The when we went to commonwealth and you asked me if I had to pick some one besides kendyl I already knew that you were it and that i didn't have to pick you besides kendyl because kendyl wasn't in the picture.  2). Eva    There's something people need to know about eva and I [especially you, anisia] Everyone has a first love. For some people their first love is their true love. For others it may take them a couple times of falling in love to find that special person. I can't lie to you [I still love eva] but like i said she's not that special person. We fell in love back in 7th grade and then things just didn't work out and now we're just friends. I still love her, but it wouldn't work out because we just want to be friends and that's what we decided back in 7th grade. I don't know when I'll find that special person or if i ever will, but i do know that you are special to me and you're the only one I want to be with.  I'm so sorry that I never explained any of this to you before.  I hope you can find it in you to give me another chance and this time i'll make things right. I love you.
