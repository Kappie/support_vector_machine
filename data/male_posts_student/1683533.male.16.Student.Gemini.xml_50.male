Americans have known for months that President Bush used weak evidence of weapons of mass destruction to push for an immediate, unilateral war with Iraq.  But in a devastating report this week, the Washington Post showed how the Bush administration systematically distorted the evidence, continuing to mislead the public after learning that the evidence contradicted their statements.  Throughout the fall of 2002, and into the weeks preceding the war in Iraq, Bush and his aides repeatedly cited intelligence that experts considered doubtful, or even untrue.  As Bush's public warnings grew more and more dire, the evidence supporting them grew more and more flimsy.  Bush's Statements Contradicted By Facts Read on to see how the Post's August 10 report picks apart Bush's claims that Iraq's nuclear program presented an imminent threat to the United States.   Bush's Statement    "A report came out of the... [International Atomic Energy Agency], that [the Iraqis] were six months away from developing a weapon. I don't know what more evidence we need." Camp David, 9/7/02     The Washington Post says....  "There was no new IAEA report... Bush cast as present evidence the contents of a report from 1996, updated in 1998 and 1999. In those accounts, the IAEA described the history of an Iraqi nuclear weapons program that arms inspectors had systematically destroyed."     Bush's Statement  "Iraq has made several attempts to buy high-strength aluminum tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon." United Nations, 9/12/02    The Washington Post says...   "Gas centrifuge experts consulted by the U.S. government said repeatedly for more than a year that the aluminum tubes were not suitable or intended for uranium enrichment. By December 2002, the experts said new evidence had further undermined the government's assertion. The Bush administration portrayed the scientists as a minority and emphasized that the experts did not describe the centrifuge theory as impossible."     Bush's Statement    "Facing clear evidence of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof, the smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud." Cincinnati OH, 10/7/02     The Washington Post says...  "What Hussein did not have was the principal requirement for a nuclear weapon, a sufficient quantity of highly enriched uranium or plutonium. And the U.S. government, authoritative intelligence officials said, had only circumstantial evidence that Iraq was trying to obtain those materials."     Bush's Statement    "The evidence indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program. Saddam Hussein has held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, a group of his 'nuclear mujahedeen,' his nuclear holy warriors." Cincinnati OH, 10/7/02     The Washington Post says...  "Bush and others often alleged that President Hussein held numerous meetings with Iraqi nuclear scientists, but did not disclose that the known work of the scientists was largely benign. Iraq's three top gas centrifuge experts, for example, ran a copper factory, an operation to extract graphite from oil and a mechanical engineering design center."    There is more of a reason to hate Bush...that's it for that...oh yea...power is back!!!....I am so glad...I don't need a fuckin generator to go on the computer...
