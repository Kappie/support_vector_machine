What is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?  Novels. And nonfiction (mostly science, philosophy, or anything that catches my eye) I love fiction. I write it too, by the way.  2. What is your favorite novel?  Here's my list. 1. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, Douglas Adams 2. Life of Pi, Yann Martel 3. American Gods, Neil Gaiman 4. Jurassic Park, Crichton 5. Any Discworld Novel by Terry Pratchett  3. Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!)  Honestly I don't read poetry. I write it, and I love to do so, but I think other people's poetry is dull because it's written just for them, a direct outpouring of a soul. Which is also why I don't really let people read mine.  4. What is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  The classics. I have Moby Dick, Don Quiote, and A Tale of Two Cities on my shelf, never sat down and read them.  5. What are you currently reading?  As it says to the right, a book for general readers about string theory, and also a novel about a postwar european detective I just picked up.
