Pray that they have my "PICCOLA" light.  The Pringle midterm went just fine, and CarolO was back today, so everything is back to normal.  ALIAS looks so mondo-scary/exciting!! A North Korean firing squad always sends fear right to my bones.  Bobby M. is back from Canada (he was just bee-boppin' around).  I AM SO EXCITED FOR WYS2004!!!!!!  It is gonna be...the best! Forget Laurel Mountain!  Seven Springs here I come!!  Can't forget the tea..and the matches..and "Likey Lunes".  Just can't.
