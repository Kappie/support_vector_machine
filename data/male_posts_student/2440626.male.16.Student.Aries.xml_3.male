I mean it is nice to stay home all day and watch daytime televison programming, but I hate having to make up all the crap that I missed.  Not to mention the fact that Wednesdays are bake sale days and Alyssa won't get her cookie.  Anywho, I am so freakin' bored.  I think I will eat a bagel.  Wish me luck.  I love you, you know who you are.  Over and out.
