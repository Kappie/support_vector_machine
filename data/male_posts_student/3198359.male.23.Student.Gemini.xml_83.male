I started fiddling around with system files (big no-no) along with the pre_binding and other things, big mistake, the net result was a computer that made my hobbling around the house look fast. On the PC front, I as muddling around with Solaris for a while, but due to its, well, "sluggishness" (thats the nicest I can be with it), I moved to FreeBSD, but that was just as bad, DRI doesn't work so the net result was a rather slow PC.    So I did a big back up/clean up, re-installed MacOS 10.3 along with all the necessary grab bag of updates - thank goodness I saved them on a CD. On the PC I re-installed Windows 2000. Sure, it doesn't set the world alight in regards to performance, however, it still more responsive than FreeBSD on the same machine.    Oh, and with that, I moved to Firebird for both the PC and Mac; 0.9.2 on the PC and 0.9.1 on the Mac, apparently the changes made for 0.9.2 are only valid for Windows users; then again, maybe they've still got to build it?    Anyway, the cool part about moving from Safari to Firefox is now there isn't this weird problem I was having with blogger.com; I assume it has something to do with features unsupported by Safari, and with that being said, there are some cool features in the article editing window like changing the font type, bullet and number lists, paragraph styles. It is now like using a wordprocessor, which is a lot more user friendly.
