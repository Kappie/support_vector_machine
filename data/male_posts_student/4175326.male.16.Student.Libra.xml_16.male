That's the word from economists with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who were trying to figure out why some nations are so much richer than others.     In addition to looking at productivity and investment factors, they examined some unconventional ideas to explain differences in national prosperity, reports Reuters. It turned out that belief in hell was very telling.    Drawing on the research from several outside economists, the St. Louis Fed studied 35 countries, including the United States, European nations, Japan, India, and Turkey and realized that religion was a powerful economic force. "In countries where large percentages of the population believe in hell, there seems to be less corruption and a higher standard of living," the St. Louis Fed wrote in a recent quarterly review.     In the United States, a whopping 71 percent of the population believes in hell. Perhaps it's no coincidence that it also has the world's highest per capita income.    Don't believe it? Look at Ireland. As Reuters says, the Irish have a healthy fear of the nether world with 53 percent of the population acknowledging hell's existence, and the country is not far behind the United States in terms of income."        I think third world countries, where people face starvation, disease, genocide, and western explotation belive in Hell just as much as well off nations, only they know they are living it. The oppression they face is something I could never grasp. Their land is pillaged and their children are enslaved in sweatshops for our coffee shops and Gap stores. Its easy for the well off to condemn others to an eternity of torment, after all they have already condemed them to a lifetime of torment. Capitalism makes me sick. Its pure exploitation and no matter what you say about the American Dream, its total bullshit.      None of us are free while others are enslaved.
