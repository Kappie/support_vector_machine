Be whoever the hell you want!  We need the 80's!  Screw the 70's, no one wants hippies, and screw the future, who wants neo-techno-hydraulic-pneumatic pancakes?  I want pancakes with ripped jeans, and self esteem through the roof!  Lets synthesize our ways into equality people!  (Except for the gays.)  We need an   80's DEVO  , and we need it now!  If you see the world as an awesome place, you're trying too hard; we have to make the world a place first!  This won't happen without you people.  Screw world vision, all Africa needs is more lasers!  Lasers and synthesizers.  Alright, take all your money that you're giving to dying kids in Africa, the freezing in Antartica, the homeless in Toronto, the paralyzed, the handicapped, the deaf, the blind, the impotent, the foreign, the obese, take all that money, and send it to ME!  A vote for  devo  isn't a vote for progress!  Let's make the world how it was before a gun was a gat, and it was cool to strut and hold your groin while abusing countless substances!  That's stupid, you don't need that!  Come on!  Let's go!  WTF ARE U WAitING 4?!!!1  LOLZ!!11 ROFLMAO WATTTTT!!!!  LET'S GO GO GO,   DEEEEEEEEEEEEEVOOOOOOOOOOOO .  Yes, I had a lot of sugar and coke tonight.  The lonely days of summer.
