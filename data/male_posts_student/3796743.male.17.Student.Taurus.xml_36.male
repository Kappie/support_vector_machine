Yes folks that means pigs, cows, and other offending animals in one small area. Not to mention the wonderful aroma coming from it. I was a happy camper. Luckily, we only stayed there for a few hours, did some other stuff, and now I'm home, rather drowsy.  Every once in a while I get in semi-depressed moods. Tonight is one of them. I usually just listen to depressing music, decide that my life is good and move on. I DON'T HAVE MY MUSIC!!! Emmy has my CD player cause I left it in her carry on when we came home from San Francisco on Tuesday. I won't get it back until Saturday when I see her at the show. Not too happy about that but oh well! I'm depressed....get over it. Tomorrow I'm going to catch up on everything...I have to get studying for the SAT too! My college company people keep saying that its my only hope of getting money for college. I need to get a 1400. I need 130 more points! Yikes....I hope I can do it...I'm gonna study like a mo fo. I havent talked to Alex in a while...don't really know why...maybe I'll call her soon...or maybe not...she can call me.  You think you know me Word on the street is that you do You want my history What others tell you won't be true I walked a thousand miles while everyone was asleep Nobody's really seen my million subtleties Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark If you want my auto, want my autobiography Baby, just ask me  I hear you talking Well, it's my turn now I'm talking back Look in my eyes So you can see just where I'm at I walked a thousand miles to find one river of peace I walked a million more to find what fish is which Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark If you want my auto, want my autobiography Baby, just ask me  I'm the baddest girl in this messed up world I'm the crazy girl in this crazy world I'm a simple girl in a complex world A nasty girl, you wanna get with me? You wanna mess with me? Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt Right now I'm solo, but that will be changing eventually, oh I laugh more than I cry You piss me off, good-bye Got stains on my t-shirt and I'm the biggest flirt If you want my auto, want my autobiographyBaby, just ask me  I love Ashlee Simpson, shes my newest hero...that song was kinda cool today...so now you've got it...kinda describes my mood at the moment...minus the "I'm a nasty girl" part....thats just....not me...Well team....I best be off...need to get some sleep. Oh and yeah...I leave on Monday for a five day family "camping" excursion...it should be an....expierience ... to say the least....looking forward to that one....Good Night everybody!
