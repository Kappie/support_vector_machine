It has got to be one of the most boring class' IN THE FRIGGEN WORLD!! Anyway we did nothing really in social and that is why it is the MOST BORING CLASS IN THE FRIGGEN WORLD!! Then we had second period which was FLA (french language arts) as you can now tell i go to a french school. Anyway in FLA we got a new question de la semain argh i hate them in fact i loath them!! Anyway I didn't work on my question de la semain cause i had to finish my debat (debat means argument in french) with Alex. Then third period i had English now english isn't a bad class but only casue you can speak english in it! But it just so happens that we're doing poetry and poetry sucks! and we got a new assignment in poetry which is due tomorrow!! ARGH! But then  it was time for lunch yay^^! Anyway lunch is my favorite time of day because i get to spend time with my girlfriend Jocelyn!! We started going out May 10th and that was the same day that i got dumped by a different girl because of an incedent with Jocelyn! Oh well she was a WHORE! so i don't give a crap! But anyway Jocelyn and I are real close and One of my friends Cara is going out with Evan P. Another one of my friends. Anyway now some kids from 8-CA or 8-CB (i dunno which one) have a bet on which couple (Jocelyn and I or Cara and Evan P.) are going to make-out first! Lots of people have there money on Jocelyn and I because we are a lot closer than Cara and Evan P.! Anyway... After lunch i had Phys. Ed and we have a Tennis/Ultimate Frisbe/Football unit now. I played football I was on a team with Jove, Curtis, Joel M., Stephen, Mitchell, Nolan, and Myself. Up against Cee Jay, Evan M., Alex, William, Deyvis, and Matthew. Anyway are team sucked BALLS! because Curtis kept throwing to Jove and Jove kept throwing it to Curtis. And they picked of the ball 3 TIMES doing that and scored 2 TOUCHDOWNS! OMG! so anyway Curtis finally throw the ball to me and I caught it and ran for the touchdown! Evan M. was in my way but that didn't matter because he's a small little dude and i just ran straight into him knocking him over (we were playing tackle football not 2 touch)! An i got the touchdown yay^^! anyways we lost 42 - 14 and the other team was on offence only 3 times!!! That just goes to show how many f***ing intercptions our QB's threw! Anyway after Phys. Ed I had band and I think that band is one of the most boring things in the world! It's only fun whenever u get to go on a band camp trip or to a festival or something out of school!  Anyways that was my day i'll blog tomorrow and tell ya what went on in a day of the life of Adam B.  And for thoughs about to rock i salute you!
