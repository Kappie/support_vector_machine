I guess the toy got broken once again and there ain't a way to fix it.  I would say there is an overall improvement of the weather on the outside. The inside is another story. Well hey... life is an adventure lets see where it all takes us... who knows this time things may be ok.  Mood: Puzzeld to death.... or rather not trusting... its very weird...
