It wasn't really because of the fact that she was academically inclined, but mostly because her speech was so advanced for the few and seemingly inexperienced years of her young life... She spoke about the "human condition" as a module of polar opposites, where there exists great despair and corruptibility alongside the triumphs of collective intellectual or philosophical pursuits - and that both circumstances were indispensable truths of the human frame. She spoke to a sold out auditorium with so much passion, it was impossible not to reflect and reconsider how each one of us matters and makes a difference! Wow!...she somehow reminded me of Ronald...  So cheers to all of you who positively affect others, as I know I was by all of you that night at the "Table", Rebekah
