Liverpool took care of England:D  What England lacks is a good right back, any left winger at all and decent strikers, Owen is ok and though Rooney was great yesterday the rest is rather average. If Eiður were English he'd be in the starting line up every time.  At least better than my country that has something like 4 decent players.  Úlli
