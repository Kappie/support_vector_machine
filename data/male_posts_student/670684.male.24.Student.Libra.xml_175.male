I talked to three high school girls at the pool today...it was just 2 pm, so I figured they had to be older than high school, as their body development solidified community college types, in my mind. Nope, 18 and ready for graduation from Orange Glen High School. But any thoughts of illicit doings with them ended when one confessed that she once dated my former stepbrother. My former stepbrother who is five years younger than me. My former stepbrother who is one year older than this girl.  I lie. They were hot. They had energy. They wore bikinis. Now I sit with a phone number and a dilemma. FEAR NOT, blog readers! I won't call. But if I see them at the pool again...  My dad and I had the talk. He didn't listen. He never does...were he to listen, he might actually do something about it, and then he can't blame my mom, my former stepmom, his mom, my sister, or the Mexicans for his joblessness, poor health, and low quality of life. I mentioned that our lack of communication for five months was a telling sign in the weakness of our relationship. "We were busy," he said. Somehow, I talk to my 40 hour work a week mom probably twice a week, but my 40 drink a week dad I don't? "We're talking now," he says, sipping the house red. "So you can finish your wine," I reply. "How does this fit into a script?" he retorts.   I want to write about porn. But how do I go into a video store and seriously ask for Girls Gone Wild? I honestly need to see Girls Gone Wild as research for this script. Regardless of your questionable thoughts regarding my content, this makes writing more exciting than researching something for an agriculturally-based plot sequence.  Bob Jensen doesn't believe in porn; according to several who witnessed a presentation of his on the subject, he finds conventional porn to belittle women. No argument there. But what about showing female pleasure in porn, or female power? What about porn produced by women? What about fetish porn, where both parties succumb to any odd trial? There is a lot of porn that questions the moral feminist argument against porn. But the main point is, porn is almost completely consumed by men (how many girls have an "other video" folder on their KaZaa desktop?). That makes porn the only consumable where the consumers hold more power than the producers.
