My diaryland site is becoming more and more incomprehensible as time goes on, and it really is more of a personal cathartic thing than an acutal blog. Seeing that I would like to have a place to air more coherent thoughts without interrupting the flow of nonsense, I have decided to set up a blog here. If you are reading this, you probably came through the discussion blog I have going with my church. If so, here is a place I will attempt to get a little deeper into some of those things we discuss, as well as other issues. Of course I may just be deluding myself and I may be the only one who ever reads this, but then so much the better...  I do apologize for any inconveniences and I promise to get this site up and looking pretty asap. Bye.
