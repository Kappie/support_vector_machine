       
      Generous hand, From the deep pocket of a philanthropist. Good causes, Your righteous hobby. Animal rights, For the anti-natalist green. A helping hand, Shoving you closer to the brink.  Anti-war, Not having won the battle in our own heart. For tolerance, Hating our neighbours, divorcing our wives. All this charity, Never restoring parity. A guest of mine, That is; if your shoes shine.  Caring for others, Could you move on tommorrow, another needs your bed? Mercy-killing, The 'merciful' mercenaries are willing. Giving of you, Not even that, the Gucci wallet remains shut too. Equality, What a lonesome idea when detached from the truth.   Could you love another day, If all that you had was taken away?
