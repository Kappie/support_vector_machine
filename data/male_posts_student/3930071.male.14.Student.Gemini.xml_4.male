He's excited to come here and play with Dwayne Wade. I think the fact that Shaq is motivated to win a championship before Kobe will lead us far into the playoffs. The Heat finally have the piece they were missing for so many years. We did not give up to much for him. The biggest player was Odom and although he was good, he was not great and is not such a price to pay for possinbly the most dominant player ever. Caron Butler was OK but came off a bad season again not much of a price. Briant Grant, although he plays hard and i like that, is undersized and aging. Im certainly excited about the new season and thik Shaq will lead us to the NBA finals.   In other news, I drafted my fantasy football team today and what a team it was. I think this is the best team i have ever had. At QB i have Chad Pennington which is due for a great season. But it gets better at runningback I have Clinton Portis and Marshall Faulk, two of the best in the league. At recieviers I have Joe Horn and Terrel Owens, also both excellent recievers. I am really looking to win the league this year.  Ill Write again next week,  Carlos
