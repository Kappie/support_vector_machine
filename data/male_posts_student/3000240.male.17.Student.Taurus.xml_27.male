We then had a massive war with her using mind games and me throwing grapefruit, and now in the end I'll be the one in the dog house probably by Dad so if I don't happen to post on here for the next few days, it's because I've been banned form the computer et al. Mum does this all the time, using her "trump card" as my sister once called it to invoke sympathy. It was her and Dad which made me decide about quitting education two weeks ago, but I think now I might be going to turn on that decision. It would all mean I'd get to move out quicker and move in with Ian, which would be pretty cool considering what I live with in this house. Oh well *sigh* xBuBzx
