Now the city of Re'dan is under attack and the martial artist village of Kythe has been called to help.  Though this is an original fanfic, if you want to write you own fanfic about it, go ahead, just tell me first, I'd want to read it.  Rated R just so I don't have to worry, I'm on the borders of PG 13 and R. And because of possible hentai later on.  Inariko:  The void kitsune Inariko has been bound to a "normal" high school girl, both forced to age backwards if they ever separate. The problem, she hates his guts.  Now the girl Yui must travel to Inariko's personal dimension Rakuen to find a way to reverse the spell and return to her life. But as you may expect, traveling through a medieval youkai infested realm isn’t as easy as she expected. But with a hanyou and her youkai partner, an android, and of course Inariko by her side, she will succeed. Right?  Crescent Winds:  The Four Holy Beasts have been resurrected and kidnapped Belldandy hoping to use her as a power amplifier. Now it’s Yusuke’s next case to get her back and save Keiichi from the System Force. Which is trying to send him to the nearest dimension to Makai, Hell.  Fallen Eternal:  Haruki, the Modern Samurai has fallen in battle. Finding that the life we live is only a test, Haruki must learn to live in a much more peaceful real world. One problem. Upon his death there was a glitch in the system and he kept his memory. But so did Aritomo, the ruthless criminal Haruki was hunting. Now with its first evil mastermind, the real Earth must face the struggle of good vs. evil.
