Not never havin no buddy to go on with or tell me where we's comin from or goin to or why. I'm tired of people bein ugly to each other. It feels like pieces of glass in my head. I'm tired of all the times I've wanted to help and couldn't. I'm tired of bein in the dark. Mostly it's the pain. There's too much. If I could end it, I would. But I cain't."   Well let's see I'm a first degree asshole right?  Goddamn it, Nat wakes me up, i start reading and I read this.  And tomorrow I have to watch the movie.  FFS, If reading that, thinking about it, and questioning my life as I know it, and being depressed for like the last 15 mins ain't enough I still have to suck in the movie tomorrow, and hell there goes a tear.  Yeah, Tomorrow's gonna be alove fest for me ain't it.  Jaysus dun think i've ever ever criedabout amovie AND a book both.  Painful.
