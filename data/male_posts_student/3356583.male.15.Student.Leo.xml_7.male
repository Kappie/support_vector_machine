Went home wif zul,erwan and hairul just now.. Met Nadira at cck station. She was going home from her friend's house. I was like sweating and so tired.. I haven't seen her for ages.. Yea i tink i miss her.. She's one good friend..She was so spunky , full of energy and very vibrant. She gave me a huge huge hug. Till i could feel her tits pressing against my chest. OMG! I wasn't smelling pretty good after my training though. Haha.. We chatted for awhile before i headed home. I said to her you're looking even prettier now.. And she replied.. Oh ya.. Of course.. As usual.. HAHA.. wad the hell...Ego babe. Aniwae we had a good laugh and its nice to see her after such a long time.. I realised i've been neglecting my friends now.. Im too busy with training , exams and my personal stuff.. It was sad. I got to know that my friend is in the Intensive Care Unit. He got attacked by 7 ppl wearing masks and each armed with a parang. He was caught off guard. Im not suppose to disclose any names now.. Aniwae my fren was like sitting in a group of friends at west coast when suddenly 7 guys with masks and parangs started attacking them. 2 of them got to run.. However he and his other friend was attacked brutally.His fren got a deep cut on the head. This friend of mine , he lost 3 fingers. Got a punctured stomach. I hope he survives.. I just saw him like last month and he was ok and cool. I just hope he'll do well.. This is shit. Didn't know the attackers from where.Oh boy.. I have nothing more to say.I'll pray for him.
