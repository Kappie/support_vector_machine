First, i would name the goat Barbra. Then, i would whisper sweet nothings in her ear so that..well, she'll get to know me better that way..neways, i'd sqeeze on her nipples...of milk of course cause i gotta drink something...even tho i'm in a well...yeah, well, after that nice venture i'd sing the slinky song!!! "Slinky, Slinky...um...da da da da dum da da!...da da da da da da dum...um...deedle lee dee de deeee!" Yeah! Then, while Barbra is under a sort of hypnosis cause of my great singing, i will attach the AWESOMELY POWERFUL SLINKY to her HUNORMOUSLY BIG HORNS and kinda catapult myself self out leaving Barbra and the Slinky to play with each other until a week passes which will end in the starving/rotting goat and a rusty stinky slinky at the bottom of a drinking well for children. Who cares! That milk was sure good tho...wah?...Goats with HUNORMOUSLY BIG HORNS aren't girls??? .......... "move over...i'm diving in!"
