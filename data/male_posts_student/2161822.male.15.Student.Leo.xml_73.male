I'm pretty sure I have about the entire right side mostly wrong and the left is not any better. Thanks to ridiculous upsets. This year is amazing. Kentucky loses to UAB. Most people don't even know who the heck UAB is. I figured to myself "hey this UAB team has no chance" and I had them losing first round. Well it just so happens that they decide to make it past the first round AND beat Kentucky. What the heck. Well anyway, I almost wet my pants watching the Georgia Tech -vs- Boston College game. I have GA Tech winning it all, so if they lost I would have been totally screwed. (Not that I'm not already screwed the way it is). Gonzaga loses to Nevada. Great there's another pick down the drain. Cincinnati loses to Illinois. By now I realize I have no chance in having a somewhat decent bracket. To make matters worse, UNC loses, Mississippi State loses, Stanford loses, Maryland loses, and NC State loses. Basically all I have left is my final four (Duke, Pitt, UConn, GA Tech). Ah March Madness is messed up this year. But hey at least it's something to watch on TV. The other day I found myself watching the national curling championships. How exciting that sport is. I also stumbled upon the channel displaying the national table tennis championship. Those dudes are crazy. They hit the ball like 100 mph and put weird spin on it. My table tennis games are limited to little taps back and forth at about 2 mph with every other hit going off the table. Yet another sport doomed for me from the start. I'm glad to see that this weekend will be nice out. I hope. But then again we are in Hazleton. Can't expect anything here. Today I walk outside and it's sunny and looks like it should be at least 50. Well, it ended up being like 22Â°. Gotta love the weather here in Hazleton. Yesterday I also found myself trying to come up with things to do on a Sunday afternoon. All me and Neil came up with was to visit the Hazleton museum on Wyoming street or visit Wal Mart. And since the museum is never open and going to Wal Mart is just plain boring, I ended up staying home yet again. Fun times.  urlLink Click here if you want to see something amusing yet pretty pathetic   Listen to H.I.M.
