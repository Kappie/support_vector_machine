It's the worst result i have ever seen for my physics paper. After recess, i have chemistry tutorial. This time, the shock is even greater than i ever imagine, i flunk my chemistry!!! Ok, and u know what? That's the worst result i have ever seen in all my papers!  At 2pm, we assembled at the hall for our chinese oral examination. I was damn tired and nervous. When it was my time at around 3 20, i was really damn sleepy. I ended up screwing my whole oral exam. The passage given was so hard that there are at least 4 words which i can't pronounce! Furthermore i stumble over the passage. Guess what's the worst? I can't even comprehend what i am saying during the conversation part.  Of cos there's a thin silver lining in the cloudy sky. You know what is it? I don't have to see my chinese result until next week!!! I am so damn glad to hear that man!At least i can sleep tonight, unpeacefully though.  If you people are wondering how much i got for physics and chemistry paper, all i can say is i did very badly. Take it as if i have never taken common tests. :)    Anyway, other than all these, i have a great day.
