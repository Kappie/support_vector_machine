Last night he somehow managed to mess it up. Bah.  Oh, and since reading the latest installment of "The Nat and Ben Saga" Jack has once again risen as the most annoying person I know. Congratulations. =P (And yes, that means you are more annoying than people like Bish, Ms Phillips, and whoever came up with the latest MacDonalds advertising campaign.)
