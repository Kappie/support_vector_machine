And no there wasn't a trace of zeal in that voice.On the contrary, it was as disinterested, morose and boring as any hairstylist's voice could get. She needn't have wasted so much of her precious energy to tell me that. The moment I sat in the chair, I'd accepted even the intake of Oxygen with some reluctance.   Now, I'm definitely not the kind of person who could be too bothered about what sheI looks like and blah. But my hair(God bless it) has this tendency of growing breadthwise more than it has the tendency to grow lenghtwise. So, after a couple of''Sneha, tie your hair; we can't see the T.V screen'' remarks from my dear family members I decided that there was no choice but to embark and get a hair cut.  ''Take your glasses off'' mademoiselle hairstylist barked at me. I would call that order pretty smart since without my glasses, my clear vision is limited to about a distance of 20 cm from my eyes and in comparison with that the mirror was quite far away. The next moment I heard a whisper in my ear ''it'll cost you 120 ruppees''; and it'll cost you about 50,000 frosty nosed killing stares from my mum you cold witch I whispered inaudibly (I hope)  So, all this being settled the process finally began. With my limited vision I saw black hair all over the floor...MY HAIR. After about 20 minutes of undiluted discomfort and misery ''done'' she yelled. With trembling hands I reached for my specs and took a closer look in the mirror; I was too much in a daze to even scream at the horror that looked back at me. My dear mother, on the other hand who was giving the renowned ''hairstylist'' the 50,000 stares (mentioned earlier) while handing out the 120 bucks started off on some big time''Oh, sweetheart don't worry about it. You look just fine. You have to try new styles, you know'' dialogue frenzy. ''Right ho'' I mumbled, now completely convinced that along with looking like a half evolved specimen from the distant lands of planet Zog, I now looked like a  half evolved specimen from the distant lands of planet Zog with weird hair. moral: Don't trust hairstylists who sound morose. They are probably facing serious problems in their lives and want to take their anger out in novel ways; for eg:cutting your hair and making you look more like a monster than the average homo sapien.Amen.
