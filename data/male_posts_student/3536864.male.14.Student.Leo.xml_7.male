That makes for one nasty yard when you're done with it. And I can't mow it during the full day, because I'd roast. Heat index and all.  So I have to wait till afternoon or morning. But, then again, it does make you buff after awhile, mowing and raking and all that fun stuff. And a bit sore too. But that's ok.  Time for an excerpt:  Pharsalus8948: my hands are sore ZuluChim: from? Pharsalus8948: i just finished mowing\raking our front yard  ZuluChim: oh Pharsalus8948: that was as thick as cheese off of a spinner Pharsalus8948: .....that was an interesting metaphore ZuluChim: uh...yeah....I was thinking the same thing  I have huge callouses on my hands though.  Going to be tough to get splinters in them now. My hands are sore at the moment, however, so typing must wait. Out for now.
