I also got a water bottle holder and a water bottle. I also bought some biking socks. they feel soooooo much better in the biking shoes than regular socks, so it should make tomorrow's trip a bit more comfortable.Iv found a hostel and made reservations. $23 a night, not too shabby. Unfortunatly my pack is a bit on the heavy side, but hey, thats life. In leaving the house 10:00 AM sharp friday morning.
