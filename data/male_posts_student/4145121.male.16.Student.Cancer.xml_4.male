Here goes...          1.Fantasy Variations     2.Ghost Train     3.T-bone Concerto     4.Dublin Sketches     5.Fate Of the Gods     6.Alvamar Overture     7.Ross Roy     8.Noah's Ark     9.Overture 2000     10. Jericho      But of course, people's reference do chage after time, so don't be surprised if I change this list after some time...heh. It's 1pm. Hm. Got a whole afternoon...I think I'll finish Mrs Long's Mths stuff first and start with probably 4A and B for Higher Chinese. Yupp, sounds good, and not to mention, I dont havta cook tonight, woohoo! (Not that i don't like cooking) I oso gotta learn how to say 1 to 10 in a dialect, funky! And so, I'm off to my little room, with my 3 Avril Posters...hehe.
