I also found out that Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11  will  be released in the US on June 25. Yay. He's a cool person, with a thing for documentaries uncovering social disputes among the American foundation. Did I mention he's cool? Anyway, in my science class, we watched "The Private Life of Plants" by David Attenbourgh. In it, a few of the plants it showed used their flowers to transport pollen by making the flower look like a female bee. Male bees would try to mate with the flower, and somewhere along the way the pollen got on the bee. The video also said that if a male bee is already trying to mate with the "female", another male bee will sometimes try to mate with the first male bee that's trying to mate with the flower. What would best describe that? Weird? Sick? Perverted? Disgusting? You tell me. I just think plants shouldn't use their sex "appeal" to lure pollenators. Sounds kind of creepy if you ask me. Oh, and here is  a WASL rough draft that I kept (because it was funny). It's the pictures up above. Sorry for the bad hand writing (you also will need to zoom in on the picture to make out the words, and you'll have to save and manually zoom in to see very clearly). Oh, and The specialists mod for Half-Life is awesome. Ch-Check It Out.
