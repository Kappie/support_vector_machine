We met at 11 (of course me, HL and Gloria met earlier) with KS, WQ, CQ and PY. Hmm. At Woodlands hor, they said they wanted to go K Box to sing songs. We were like already decided to go Pasir Ris Beach, but they all sian too troublesome. Made me do all those work for nothing. Meow!  We have to wait for Joyce, so we went to play Pool. HaHa. WQ didn't play. We met SL there and she's joining us for K-Box later. We played some pool where my team won some. Hmm. Janet came by, and we stood around chatting. Joyce came, and we chatted some more lor.  It was like until 1 when we decided to move on. HaHa. We went to CCK's Lot 1. We decided to go eat lunch first. HaHa. I am buying Gloria's share, because she said she'll follow what I eat. We ate chicken rice, where I drank the big bowl of soup (she said she don't drink soup). I also owed CQ $2.50. HaHa.  After lunch, we went into K-Box to sing lor. Sing until 7pm ar. Janet and KentKent got join us for awhile. SL and the two of them left first lor. Hmm. There weren't much (okay, that's an understatement. It is very little) EL songs. There weren't ANY current ones...sigh! I have to sing the Chinese songs I know (most of them oldies, and the new ones are the SHE songs I often listened with CQ). I had fun singing them. My first song sang was Lian Ren Wei Man by SHE. I like that song a lot a lot. Hmm. WQ did not sing at all, even though he picked songs. Meow!! So shy for what? My singing sucks, but I still sang (although reluctantly at first, but I grew used to the mic). Meow moo meow. We went out at 7.  Oh my meowing god. The basic charge is $16, whcih I paid la. There's this +++, which means extra $5.80 lor. We were like kinda worried at first, because we thought we haven't have enough. Luckily, some of us brought a lot of moolah, so can pay first. Woah!! HaHa. Later, we went to Macs to slowly calculate. I have to pay CQ back. In the end, I owed him $6 (I paid him back some moolah). We aklso ate some ice-cream and then went back la.  I went to Metro to talk to Wendy. WQ accompany me, because he's meeting his parents there too. HaHa. As usual, me and Wendy talked la. Chatted and chatted. Her colleague, Ayu, knows me le. I come a lot of times when she's here ma. Heh Heh. I even "helped" her do her homework, which is somesort like a test on Wendy's saleperson's skills. Meow moo. I went home at 9 something.  Hmm, went home, bathed and went online. Oh my god...I did badly at one of my essays, I think it is DADA. Shit. I am so worried. My Straight Os record is tarnished!! Oh meow.  Oh yes, before I go: I feel so stupid! I am so stupid. I know....I shouldn't say that, but I feel so. Sigh... I think too much la. Hmph.  Okay. I managed to beat the time, by ending before 12am. Okay. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
