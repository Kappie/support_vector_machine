You see, Spiderman, along with his webspinning and wall climbing abilities, he also aquired the ability to bite people and turn them into spidermans (or spidermen, whatever) too. Kinda like a Count Parker. Near the end, Spiderman goes to a Lakers game with Mary-Jane, and after they win, Spiderman bites Shaq on the neck. "Doc Ock" picks up a gun and aims it at Spiderman. Spiderman (or 'Spiderman' as I like to call him) uses his web to spin himself a bullet proof suit, but he spends too much on the crotch support and Doc Ock shoots him. I know what you're thinking, "But Spiderman didn't die in any of the comics, therefore he's immortal!" Don't send e-mails with lots of swear-words to the messenger, I'm just telling you what I saw. Oh, and Mary-Joe gets married (get it?!?1 MARYd?! HAHA I KRAK MISELF ^!!?!?1.,.,111tgvags).  Also, it's fun to read the credits at the end because sometimes they have really funny names. Like there's this guy in special effects, his name was Dr. Krakohedovich, and everyone cracked up as soon as they saw the name-- I mean, what doctor goes into special effects?! Haha! BTW, does anyone know who played Bobby-Joe?  Good news though, there's going to be a  Spiderman 3  and Shaq's in it!  Sincerely, Andresman  P.S. i wundr if spydrman nos how 2 swingdance (get it?!?! SWING!!?! i MadE A JOke!?!?!1!?,.  P.P.S. From now on, I shall no longer known as 'Peter Pan', I am 'Peter Parker'.  P.P.P.S. Why was the burrito place closed? Fourth of July doesn't apply to Mexicans-- but I guess if I follow that logic, I shouldn't take the day off either, I'm British/Chinese.
