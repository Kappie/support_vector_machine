Quite amazing.  Well the Friday, the epic  Troy  hits theaters.  Looks like it's gonna be good.  Zak showed me this website today that I can download different DVD box arts from.  Unfortunately, you have pay for each one that you download.  The site is www.dvdboxart.com in case anyone was wondering.
