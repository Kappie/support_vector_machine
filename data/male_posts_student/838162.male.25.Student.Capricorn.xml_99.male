Currently working on   The Cure   in between whatever free time I got between studying and assignments. But I think it would be good to gather some feedback on what story to work on next after I’m done with this one. All the better to plan ahead with. Lord knows I need it. Would like to focus on trying a hand at making music using the digital tools at my diposoal, but it seems to be a far more time consuming method of expression, so I'm not totally eliminating writting for fun.   Anyway go to the  urlLink Writings  page and check out the short synopsis for each story and let me know which one you would like to read more about and I’ll focus on that one. Feel free to use the comments link below.
