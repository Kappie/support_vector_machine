You know, randomperson1. I guess I just thought that since she was my friend, why couldn't she be more? She obviously wasn't interested, it was just my mind tricked me into thinking she was. Then, after she found out I liked her, I still thought, "Hey, maybe I still have a chance." Well, it is time for me to stop kidding myself and get over it. randomperson1 is still my friend, i'm cool with that, I just feel pathetic on myself for thinking she would ever like me. HEHE, you (public) might never see this becuase I don't know if I will post it because it is a complete mockery of myself, but then agian, everyone reading this, with the exception of a few people have no idea who I am, but still, I don't know, but if I do post it, you will be reading this now and you can laugh. WOW! that was one hell of a run-on sentence...lol :).  later, bradleyJ
