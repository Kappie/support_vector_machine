I'm going to be putting my new blog there, and porting the bagel.tech posts over here in a few days.  So, here's a few things you need to know about what's going to be coming to Blog of Bagel soon:   Blog of Bagel Gmail Contest  I'm going to keep doing the Gmail contest, but moving it over here and changing the rules around a little bit.  Look for new details later on.   More Posts  Now without bagel.tech, time will come in a larger package, so expect more new features coming here in no time.  Posts will get more interesting once school starts, so until then, check out what I have for you here anyway.  Audio posts when I'm out of town, and computer posts when I'm here.    That's pretty much all... I'm going to be putting a lot more time into this site to make it better, and you can expect more from Blog of Bagel in the coming weeks.
