Unforgetable Memory Number 2:  Dying my hair blue, not only did I get suspended for that but it gave me a perfect reason to shout at Mrs. Worthington.  Unforgetable Memory Number 3:  Meeting Xav cause if It wasnt for him, I wouldnt be the person I am today and wouldn't have the friends I have today. Thanks alot man.  Unforgetable Memory Number 4:  Stealing Alex's bag and getting punched in the ribs several times for it!  Unforgetable Memory Number 5:  Hiding in Mr. Kemps reg several times before he drew the line and just constantly threw me out straight away.  Unforgetable Memory Number 6:  Meeting Charli, it was hard because it caused alot of problems with my friends like hanging around with her when they didnt know her but it was well worth it.  Unforgetable Memory Number 7:  Stealing Alex's bag and getting my head slammed into the wall for not giving it back.  Unforgetable Memory Number 8:  One of my best memories is choking Dean Gauci after he threw a rock at me.  Unforgetable Memory Number 9:  Walking out of Welsh after refusing to learn any more because I didn't enjoy it.  Unforgetable Memory Number 10:  Stealing Alex's bag and getting kicked in the neck pretty damn hard for it.  Unforgetable Memory Number 11:  Winning best dressed at the prom... heh oh wait... I didn't.  Yeah so there are more but those are the ones I'll never forget, I think i'm going to miss Corpus alot, cause after 5 years there its made a big impact on my life, mainly the people I met. So long Corpus.
