Still, it maintains a great deal of profound truths.  It says life in and of itself is rubbish, but we know this.  We know this because people like Solomon.  They that have had it all, but found no true joy INHERENTLY in those things, they have reiterated the idea of Ecclesiastes throughout history.  It's as plain as, "look both ways before you cross the street," it doesn't take a biblical doctrine to teach us this, it takes history.   Still we see it today, we see it in the Kurt Cobains, and Elvis Presleys, who have everything, but the only thing that really matters, in the end.    It was Jesus who said:  "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal;   for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. "  Perspective.  Further, an important point to keep in mind when studying Ecclesiastes, is that Solomon often uses the euphemism "Under the sun" and this is commonly understood as meaning apart from God, or apart from eternity.  So he is talking about worldy things within the context of this life alone...  In which case, Solomon could not be more correct, it is indeed " all vanity, a mere chasing after the wind."  Solomon may have come to the point where he was chasing those things, his joy depended on those things...and so he could clearly see that it was all a trivial pursuit.     If you recall what Elderidge was saying in "The Journey of Desire,"  he essentially said that we were attempting to rebuild Eden on earth, but that this was futile because of the reality and consequences of Sin.    On a side note, I was thinking about some stuff...  We all like stuff, some more than others, and again some less than others.  And we all know we are not to put our hope in the material, the fleeting.  We know what this means conceptually, but what about practically?  Don't our actions speak about where we have placed our hope?   The majority of Christians know that it is the "LOVE of money" that is the root of all evils, they know that it's ok to own money, as long as "money doesn't own you."  But what does this mean in real practical terms....?  How do you know when you are starting to love money, when it is starting to own you?  I don't think sirens and fireworks go off when one has crossed the line, but rather it probably happens quite subtly... i imagine it creeps up on you through your daily choices...again I imagine it would be like any other addictive sin, that we will attempt only to justify it to ourselves... the love of money hmm.  If we are not to love money, what does that mean for my daily choices?    "The things you own, end up owning you..." - Fight Club  I don't know dude, I guess I have grown weary in sharing what I believe about materialism, that is at least with "word of faith Christians."   I don't think we SHOULDN'T have anything material, (I remember our discussion long ago)...I just think we shouldn't place such a high value on them, (and I think that was what I was trying to express years ago, metaphorically), we shouldn't spend so much of our time, our precious lives, our energy, obsessing over material goods, and the false promises that advertising has us believing.  It makes us look foolish, like there is no heaven.  Like this is it.    Perhaps we might place more value on helping others, living as servants, living the reality that this life is so short, and that we have a proper eternal perspective on our priorities...ah the gospel.   Perhaps we need to live lives that testify to the truth that this world and all in it will be destroyed, and that our heaven is not here, our paradise is not here...        ...and I myself, most of all..."
