You probably know me, so you probably do actually expect this -- but imagine for a moment that you're my only non-Arizonan reader, and that you don't know me. You'd never see this coming. You'd never see the Black Blossom going political coming.  So here goes.  This year's election.  Politics.  Kerry versus Bush.   Bush versus Kerry.  Who to choose?  After all, this election is so important. Haven't you heard? I mean, if Bush gets elected the world will explode. But if Kerry gets elected, the moral fiber of this nation will unravel at the seams, opening us up to attack from our enemies. At the same time, if Bush gets elected, we'll all be put in concentration camps for having violated the laws of Thoughtcrime. But if Kerry gets elected, nothing will get done, and eventually terrorists will kill all of us. But if Bush wins, the entire world will lash out at America, declare war on us, and everybody will hate us forever. But if Kerry wins, the entire world will lash out at America, declare war on us, and everybody will hate us forever.  It seems to me that both of these campaigns are being run on rather dire platofrms.  They both claim to be optimistic, but they're only optimistic if you vote for the right guy.  If you vote for the wrong guy, and the wrong guy gets elected, we all die.  If we vote for the right guy, and the right guy wins, we'll all be showered with wealth, security, and hell, a couple dozen virgins.  We jsut have to choose the right one.  Behind door number one is heaven, behind door number two, hell.  We just have to choose the right door... unfortunately, there are no numbers on the doors, so it's a gamble either way.  Bush is opposed to stem-cell research. Kerry supports it. So which one do I vote for? The one that wants to kill fewer babies, or the one that wants to kill fewer adults?  When is life acceptable, and when is death acceptable? Who should be allowed to live?  These are apparently campaign questions.  Can anybody really answer those questions?  Should anybody really be trying to give me the answers?  Personally, I think the idea of a nation trying to answer those questions is stupid.  How the hell is a country supposed to come to a consensus on who lives and who dies?  I'm sick of the whole idea that everything leading up to this election is the most important thing in the world.  Like history is ending.  Like people are going to stop dying if the right person is elected.  Like people are going to stop killing each other over frivolities.  Like diseases are going to disappear because of the President, and not brilliant doctors.  Like world peace is going to fall over the world if I can just make the right vote at the right time...  Everybody knows who they're voting for, and that's fine.  But when we die, whether it's tomorrow or in 70 years, the Middle East is still going to be an extremely turbulent place.  People are still going to murder each other.  Women will still get raped by soldiers, despots will still be exploiting common-folk.  There will still be disease, and natural disasters.  There will still be a hole in the ozone layer, and it'll probably be bigger.  Neither Bush nor Kerry are actually going to change that.  The most infuriating thing about living in the United States is that everybody buys into this kind of crap.  Everybody thinks they know what's best for everybody, and everybody acts on that.   Everybody has an opinion, and everybody is right.  Everybody is fighting the good fight, day in and day out, and if it weren't for all those other people that disagree with them, it'd be paradise.  It seems to me that is the story of human history, the consistent failure to find ways to disagree. Some people just know what's right -- and when people know what's right, they don't have to be respectful to people who are wrong.  Kerry and Bush know what's right.  So do their followers.  Thank god they always have to tell me.
