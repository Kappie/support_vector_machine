We took the number 1 downtown, so we could take the train to sunridge, but the anderson train came first, so my bright idea was that we get on that and go to chinook instead.  So we sawed AVP...which wasn't THAT spectacular. Not nearly gory enough, not nearly scary enough, and not nearly enough humans getting ripped to shreds. And when the humans did get ripped to shreds, they didn't even show it. Paul Anderson should have opted for an R rating instead of PG-13 so there could be some serious gore. But hey, worth the 10 bucks. At the end, I couldn't help but feel there was going to be a makeout scene, that is, until she looked at its face...  So, the movie's over, and it's like midnight, so we take the anderson train back downtown. By then it's like 12:30, and no more busses are running. Me one friend lives in inglewood, and the other in erin woods. So we walks her home to inglewood. That was a nice long walk, but we all survived. It was worth it all in the end, because we got to see her mom in her pyjamas! So then we walked back to my house...That was a long fucking walk. Then we get home and the adventure was over. Oh well.  Then, this morning...er...afternoon, when we woke up, we had to hook up the "new" tv in the living room, because fuckface took the other one when he left. That took a really long time. Further investigation would reveal that one of the RF cables was busted...joy. So we have television now! Yay...Yay for the degredation of our society.  You know, everybody's saying that our generation will be the one that changes the face of the earth, but I doubt that. Society is on a slow and steady slope downwards. We are just as biased and inolerant as ever...And not to mention destructive. I predict an apocalypse or two around...2035...
