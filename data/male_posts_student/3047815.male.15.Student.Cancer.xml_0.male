The only thing that has not been done is a crewed landing on Mars. In 1893, a gentleman by the name of Frederick Jackson Turner delivered a speech at the annual conference of the American Historical Society. This little known professor from the University of Wisconsin characterized America, not through religion or politics, but the existence of the frontier:   ...to the frontier the American intellect owes its striking characteristics. That coarseness of strength combined with acuteness and inquisitiveness; that practical, inventive turn of mind, quick to find the expedients; that masterful grasp of material things, lacking in the artistic but powerful to effect great ends that restless, nervous energy, that dominant individualism, working for good and evil, and withal that buoyancy and exuberance that comes from freedom-these are the traits of the frontier, or traits called out elsewhere because of the existence of the frontier. Since the days when the fleets of Columbus sailed into the waters of the New World, America has been another name for opportunity, and the people of the United States have taken their tone from the incessant expansion which has not only been open but has even been forced upon them. He would be a rash prophet who should assert that the expansive character of American life has now entirely ceased. Movement has been its dominant fact, and, unless this training has no effect upon a people, the American energy will continually demand a wider field for its exercise. But never again will such gifts of free lands offer themselves. For a moment, at the frontier, the bonds of custom are broken and unrestraint is triumphant. There is not tabula rasa. The stubborn American environment is there with its imperious summons to accept its conditions; the inherited ways of doing things are also there; and yet, in spite of the environment, and in spite of custom, each frontier did indeed furnish a new opportunity, a gate of escape from the bondage of the past; and freshness, and confidence, and scorn of older society, impatience of its restraints and its ideas, and indifference to its lessons, have accompanied the frontier. What the Mediterranean Sea was to the Greeks, breaking the bonds of custom, offering new experiences, calling out new institutions and activities, that, and more, the ever retreating frontier has been to the United States directly, and to the nations of Europe more remotely. And now, four centuries from the discovery of America, at the end of a hundred years of life under the Constitution, the frontier has gone, and with its going has closed the first period of American history.  That first period of American history is now long past closed, and so is the second period, mainly the Space Age. The next great frontier for human endeavor is Mars. Right now, society is stagnating. Music, art, science, everything. Things are beginning to repeat themselves. What we need is a new frontier, a new chapter in life. Mars can provide this frontier. The Red Planet is the perfect candidate for a frontier. It is the only place in our solar system that we know of that can support a civilization. The colonization, or even manned exploration of Mars will yield immeasurable riches, not only in terms of economic growth.Economically, Mars is not a problem. Technologically, Mars is not a problem. Politically, Mars is a problem. The budget of NASA, over a span of one decade, is enough to support a crewed Mars mission. The technology exists now to launch humans to the Red Planet. But, the political climate is one that does not want scientific advancement, or a new scientific adventure. Today, politics wants conquest; politics wants military adventures that could secure a steady stream of oil; politics wants money; politics wants security. But what politics does not want is science. Science is heavily under-funded today. Government scientific institutions, such as NASA, are slowly bleeding to death. NASA's current budget is $6 billion, which hampers NASA's true potential. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the end of the Lyndon B. Johnson presidency, NASA lost a lot of support in Congress as well as the White House. NASA's budget started to drop, and now it is at a low. But this low budget, with the reallocation of funding by the Bush space proposal, is more than enough to reach the Red Planet. Research done during the Space Age on nuclear rocket engines, and life support processes for long duration space flight can be adapted for use on a crewed Mars mission. If this technology is revived, then costs can be cut even further. Nevertheless, the end of the Bush presidency (hopefully) will bring about a definite change in political climate, with relations with other nations being smoothed out, and economic stability. Mars may soon be within reach. Mars provides the challenge that humankind needs to further its evolution and rescue it from a period of intellectual stagnation. Mars is our New World to explore, and colonize.
