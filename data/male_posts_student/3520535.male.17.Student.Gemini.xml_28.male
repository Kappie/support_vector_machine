Times that stand on their own, without needing to be propped up by a backstory, or context. Having a drink on top of a restaraunt in Key West, leaning against the railing watching the sun set, maroon radiance casting a glow upon the street performers below. Running through the streets of Cordoba at night, not really knowing what I'm looking for, and hoping that I never find it. The breeze from a fort in St. Augustine, wondering what the nation was like when people actually used this building as a fort, before the English had established so much as a single city on ancient soil. Driving at god-knows how fast down a deserted back road at night knowing that if I had hit anything I'd likely die. The sky-flyer at Kings Dominion with my older sister. When I'm a broken old man, these memories may well be all that's left of a life, people missed, and chances squandered.
