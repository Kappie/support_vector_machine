They don't survive on dead organisms, and in order for them to live they require that their meals are living.  The males drink the nectar of plants to survive, while the females drink the blood of mammals in order to gain enough energy to lay eggs. Both of their meals exist outside of the insect realm, they do not eat other insects at all- which is interesting when you start to think of the diets of other creatures on the planet.  Mosquitoes are very successful at what they do- although interestingly enough their only real enemies are the elements and human beings.   Why is it the most powerful creatures on earth hate these little bugs so much? Because the allergic reaction to their bites are inconvenient and in the past Mosquitoes have been a source of disease.  The most interesting thing is that in order to kill mosquitoes people use really nasty chemicals, which in the long run could harm people more. Personally I would rather take my chances with a mosquito bite then to be inhaling or absorbing some toxic chemical thats bound to give me cancer.  So in a strange way, I've found a respect for the biology of the mosquito, and although they lead very simple lives- they are very kind to the world around them.
