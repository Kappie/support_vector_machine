Then at 1:30, we started to walk to Redditch Alex Hospital, this was full of tails from me my, brother and Josh  talking about fights,  which was real interesting i suppose. When we got too the hospital, we sat in the waiting room, then I went in too my appointment, and there was this random person, staring at us for about ten minutes (he was about 13), so my mate stared bag, and this kid started to grit his teeth at us, then he did it too me and I burst out laughing, which made this kid smile, then this kid lent down and started too look up my mates shorts, so we took the piss, and like did gay jokes, like lisp's, the wierd hand thing and put our legs up on the chair and winking, then he got pissed off and went into his appointment.  After this, we waited outside, got on the bus and the bloke let us off the bus fair, which was wicked of him, then we went into Redditch town centre, and my mate bought a game called Shocking Rulette, we played this while eating mcdonalds!! What you have to do, is put your finger in a little hole, and then you press a button, a light spins around, and you wait, and you have too try and keep a straight face whoever is shocked, and if you don't you're out. Its wicked, and the schock is just irritating, not really bad!!  After this, I went and bought a fake moustache, and walked around with this realistic Moustache on, it looked as if people wanted too look at me, but they didn't want too, because they thought I had a disease or something! It was funny, then I went into a shop asking for shaving foam, and the people behind the counter and people in the shop burst out laughing at me, I just evilled them.  After this, I went down the wrong escalator, and the Security Guard Chased me, and then he had a go at me, and I was like, "OK!!! I have a moustache!!" Then we left, unfortunately for my friend Josh, a load of townies are after him because he helped my other friend in a fight, and on the bus were none other than some of the alcester crew, so we had too take a load of high pitched verbal abuse from them, and might I add, is "I fucked your mum" the best that they can come up with, its just really lame.......  Because of this, we got off at the hospital and walked home! It was great, more talk about fighting, so I bought a drink and a magazine, and we walked through the Recreation Ground, where the kid who broke my nose and his mates were, but I kept a straight face, so we went back later, and Chris, the person who broke my nose, wouldn't even look at me, and when he did, he looked away straight away, so I don't think that i'll get anymore shit off of them anymore, so I'm happy now, anyway, I'm off...
