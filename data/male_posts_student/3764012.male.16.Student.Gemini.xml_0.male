They will get it from me , 1 day they will let me screw upside down ...And I promise ... Secondly NDP , the drills of both the NCC and the NPCC GOH sucks like hell include me , I cannot believe it ! , worse than SHIT .... Thirdly , bloody hell ...... Don't know what to say really stuck in a turmoil , I want to get out of it ! becasue of xuan zhu , I dont know should i give up and go focus on my studies , taekwondo and NPCC or should i also include her in my goals ????..... then now somebody is trying to go near her , I cannot stand it anymore , i do not want to get affected by her but i just cannot let it go , i swear to myself i will never give up , i can break the promise that i made to other people but i AT LEAST must keep my own PROMISE .... but then i also cannot force someone to like me , she said i dont know her well , fine , but when i want to know her she run away from me , fine , this made me feel like i am a monster , i stopped talking to her after the BBQ , only ocassionaly on msn , basically i feel abit awkward and becasue i am busy and also N levels , i foce myself not to think about her instead it grew the opposite way , this is more powerful than a drug , what is worse , this few days SOMEBODY trying to do something to impress her which i heard and see enough .... man i dont want to complain i dont want to think i just feel like i need a break or should i just leave it to fate maybe it is better ... what is mine will be mine ,waht is not mine will not be mine
