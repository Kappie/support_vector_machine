It's like..Whoa..Yeah. So anyways, I don't use my blog to "vent" the energy or anger that built up during the day, or to otherwise use it to inform others about what I did today. If you want to know you can ask!   John, do you still check this thing? If you do, we should talk sometime, and think about some questions to think about. That was good...I might have a few things to say..   So. Right now, I'm thinking about...Homework...and not just what everyone says ->  "I'm so lazy!"   "I hate homework!"    "This is stupid!"  Is it possible that one is so unmotivated to do homework at this point in life, but will somehow magically become more motivated once out of high school... As of now, I can't do my homework for reasons I'd rather not discuss, but I feel like once I'm on my own schedule, I will be slightly different. Something weird is telling me that I just wont have the same "forceful" figures beckoning me to start my homework. Maybe I can make my own choices when to start. That's why I want to go to a summer school college. If my thoughts now do not match up to the reality of things, then I'm sorta screwed over gong into college with that kind of mindset...So I dunno...Gotta make a choice. Just like always!  Current music:  !....I don't do that! ..But my computer is making some funny noises....real funny indeed..
