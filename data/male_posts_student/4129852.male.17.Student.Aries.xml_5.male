I feel this way when I am feeling emotion that i dont know how to interpet i dont really know if its sadness or joy i feel now all i know is im feeling a lot of it. I can often feel the way the ppl around me feel I interpret what they are feeling and i in turn feel that way. that is the reason im the way i am. i focus on understanding what other feel and how others act sometimes i forget about me. But hey there are a lot of ppl who are more interesting than me. thats why I am a rounded person I take the cool parts of my friends and i become that, so i feel better about myself. I guess that makes me a huge phony but hey if you are gonna do something might as well be convicted.... or not whatever   i guess im done for now
