I can remember them, if I really try, so that's an extremely good thing. Dreams are actually a lot of fun, a purely original show playing out in the deep abyss that is your brain.  Anyway! =P   The Girl =)  I've got to make sure I don't chicken out on this =) I've got to make sure I don't screw it up monumentally. I just want a fair chance at asking her out, without any trip-ups, or half broken sentences. If I make a good stand, and she says no, I'll be happy, because I made my stand. Then, it'll be even more confusing if she says yes =P We're kind of in different social groups, both kind of inbetweeners, and that means that at school we probably wouldn't have a great amount of contact. Oh well, at this stage, it's a dream, but a dream which I hope has at least some foundations outside of the Wonderland playing itself inside my head.   My teeth are imprisoned in bars of metal! =P  The braces are going alright, I guess =) I got them in two days ago now, and they're about as bad as the spacers I had in before, but with the major difference it hurts to chew on anything at the moment =) Yes, anything, biscuits, sausages, and  especially  calamari! It takes a lot of getting used to though, especially when I tried to whistle for my dog, and then all of the sudden noticed it wasn't working too well. After a few stops and starts I found out it worked, but haphazardly lol Only time will tell, I so hope I get used to them! =P   Last Exile  I still haven't gotten that last episode of Last Exile! Episode 26, the final one, that's it. Still haven't got it... *sigh* lol. It's actually not that bad, if I leave my connection on for approximately 26 hours and start downloading, it'll be done, but the problem is that it isn't a resuming one, so an hour here or there won't work. It's an amazing series though, so I'll get the end of it eventually.   Star Trek  Star Trek Season 7 Marathon finished today, and I hadn't even noticed that Star Trek: The Next Generation had finished in 1994, silly silly me =) I quite like the series generally, I mean, nothing really challenges you mentally since Macguyver, it's good to see something which expands the general ideas of consciousness and of possible relaties, time, anti-time, etcetera =) It was good while it lasted! =)   Homework  It really doesn't seem fair, but my last week is going to be partially ruined by homework. Fabulous me has left an assignment off until the last minute, a writing one, so I'm going to have to test how fast I can write this week, should go well, on a computer I can type faster than I can write. Anyway, that's my main bother =)   Forrest Gump  An excellent movie, makes you feel every major emotion during it's length... I don't have too much to say about it, apart from that =)   Creativity  It's that time again, to release the mental anguish =) Perfect time too, my music just clipped over onto Linkin Park, In the End, my favourite song, EVER!  Like a whirlwind inside of my head =)  An alleyway with ladders running up and down to the ceiling around it, and electronics, and wires, hanging out of every wall and sparking - A man is standing in the middle of it all, turning around, in a relaxed stance, to look at you. Two men, fighting on rooftops, which are tiled, running up and down with an agility never seen before - one falls off of the edge, but rebounds quickly using some kind of cord and the gutter of the building - they continue fighting and leaping from rooftop to rooftop. A man walking down a street, in the dark cold of midnight, and down a run down alley he encounters two guys, and rises slowly from his slunky walking pose to fight them off quickly. A electric train is running it's route between different flying cities, all connected by a small runway between them - All of the sudden the train is attacked with a kind of high-tech ballista, which fires a connective rope from far below straight into the vessel, letting others take over the train - the floating buildings it travels between look like pyraminds, but with quite a few extensions mainly below it. A vessel, meant for anti-grav transport, with a rudder at the back to direct airflow, it's coloured green and marked with golden runic symbols, on the bottom it has an engine which fits snuggly into the whole design - the whole thing looks like a fish with it's head and tail cut off, ie, tapering towards the end. Like in X-Men, with the girl who can go thru walls, someone fades into a building's wall and starts pushing out the bricks which hold it together - the guards come over to inspect what the hell's happening, and all of a sudden, out of the darkness just caused by the brick's hole, and hand comes thru - WOOOMPH - and knocks the guard stone cold =P ...   Oh well, not quite as good tonight, but I've been talking to my cousin Kate quite heavily =)  Here's to another day over, and yet another long night just begun!
