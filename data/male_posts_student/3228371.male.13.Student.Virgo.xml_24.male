He said "joey...i really dunt think u understand how much i love u" but I guess I can say the same for him. Meh, whatever.  You know what...? I need to read. The Bible. Erica came online. Hmm, I'm tempted to say something but never mind. This'll be better if I type it up and email it... Whatever. Blog later.  Nima came back online. His computer froze. He said "joey...im tired of making mistakes. i want every moment with u 2 b happy" But he doesn't understand that... it's not his fault, it's mine. I'm just... too picky and... screwed up. I dunno... he's offline now. His mom wanted him to get off. He said he'd call later. Meh...  Blog later.
