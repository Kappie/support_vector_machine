As soon as i get home today i am putting on the home-made, uptown, cut-off man capri's, ah yeah...those three inches of shin totally make the difference. I am so loving this weather...but, i want the trees to leaf out and the grass to green up.l I can't deal with all the brightness without anything to cut it. Sunglasses are really not my style. Think all the hair is coming off...shaving my head and getting rid of the beard. It is time for a change, and i realized wednesday night that i am starting to look old with the hair and the beard. Not like old old, but strange old. Time to get rid of that.
