In France, I went to Paris and went to Notre Dame, the Louvre and saw the Mona Lisa, etc.,etc. and a couple other places for 3 days. When I got to Italy, I went to Rome and visited the Vatican, Ancient Rome (inc. the Colloseum), and just the whole city. I went to Florence and went to some markets, the Ponte Vecchio, Trevi Fountain, some Duomo's, and lots of other places,while staying at a B I was in Milan for a day and went to the Duomo and a couple of monumental things. Then we went to London for a night to fly back to the states and it was pretty cool, we were in a 5 star hotel. We had a connection flight to DC from Toronto and there was a 6 hour layover in Toronto. Our flight was cancelled for 'equipment failure' for 2 hours and then it rained/lightninged for 3 hours and then the pilot didn't show up for an hour. The trip was good, except Sorcha is a skank-ass whoring bitch. I give the trip an 8 because of her. If she wasn't there, it would've been a 10. BTW: I'll post lots of pictures once I get all my film developed and a scanner. PS: I lost my brand new CD player on my flight from Paris to Rome and tripod on my trainride from London to Paris. yay -.-'
