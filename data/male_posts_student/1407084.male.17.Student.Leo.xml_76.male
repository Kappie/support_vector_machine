Love can be a many splendored thing Can't deny the joy it brings A dozen roses  Diamond rings Dreams for sale And fairy tales It’ll make you hear a symphony And you just want the world to see But like a drug that makes you blind It’ll fool you every time  The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger then your pride The trouble with love is It doesn’t care how fast you fall And you can’t refuse the call See you’ve got no say at all
