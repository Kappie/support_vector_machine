It's so great....wrong in so many ways...yet hilarious.   urlLink The International Rules of a Farting Competition .  Yes...you saw correctly.  Rules for a farting competition.  Anywho, its 2AM...2 of my friends are online still, which is cool, since usually everyones dead asleep by now.  But not me!  Well..soon enough.  Anyways, Superbowl is tomarrow.  BFD.  I won't even be watching it because I think it's stupid.  I was going to go to Disneyland again...but I'm not going to wear that place out.  It's good for a few visits every once in a while.  Instead I'll probably be sleeping all day, or something.  But yah...No Stupidbowl for me.  And I get to hit Knott's soon so I can get that Solace ticket I need to get so I can go in at freakin 5 AM or something to ride rides.  Which is insane.  There's no way in hell I'm gonna get up in time.  But thats at a later time, I'm not bitching about that yet.  I saw some pictures my friend took today.  She rocks at photography.  Seriously, she rocks, and will always rock, forever and ever and ever.  Reminded me I needed to take some shots of Haunted Mansion soon, my other ones are way out of date.  And, I feel like it.  Okay yah....well, okay I guess I'll bitch about this new month.  It blows.  Seriously just...it needs to be done with already.  And then it'll be March....which isn't that much better, since then that's Solace time, where I get to put up with those 3,000 lb ACEr's.  And all they talk about is rides.  It's so bad!  But all will be made up when I get to like ride rides at freakin 7AM.  Nothing better than riding Montezooma's in the front at 7AM.  Seriously, it rocks.  But yah, I'm more into Supreme Scream than other rides.  That ride is just cool.  And I guess this year they're doing like...ERT on the Log Ride and the Mine Ride....wow...I can see that now...4000 lb boats running at like 2 mph breaking the flume and shooting water everywhere.  And the mine trains will probably derail because of fatness.  Ugh..I'm shuddering at the thoughts of it already.  Well, since I'm a bitch today...I'm done...so...bye.
