Finally I started talking to my new schoolmates, most of them are my smoking khakis. It's boring to smoke alone too. There was morning class today and I had to drag my ass off the bed. I knew it! There's something wrong with me on Monday! Shower, Online, School. Same old procedure just like the past two days. IT. My favorite subject, too bad my favorite teacher is teaching that subject. Mr Unique Hairstyle. Hahaha Smoking break after IT, and met Daryl and two of his classmates there. Only remembered one of their name. During FK class we watched a video of the slaughtering process of sheeps. CooL ~ School is getting interesting. Lunch time finally! Took free bus go eat with smoking khakis, kenna tork by the rice seller. After POC we finally made it to the kitchen. Got to see all the stuff there, getting to cook on Friday. Tomorrow is sharpening knives day, rox. Want to go gang fight can borrow knives from me.. Guranteed for slaughter. Hahaha Gotta run, gotta organize my notes for the day.  Be back tomorrow
