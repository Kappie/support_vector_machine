Staring up the sky, I hope to forget you one day,  And tightly closes my eyes,  Thinking about the day, when there will be someone who will take your place,  So that I will not think of you anymore,  Staring up the sky, from sadness to a smile,  And then tightly close my eyes, Thinking once again, your tender face and the things we have done, Before I forget..........   Oi Thim  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
