It had good special effects, and good acting (Sean Connery is old but he can still act).  The only problem was that it had one of those endings that left you hanging......I  hate  it when they do that!!!  So there will definitely be a sequel.   Good movie though, recommend you see it.  I am ungrounded today, so the band is gonna practice today!  I am stoked for that.  I am gonna sit down and work on some songs after I finish blogging.  I also need to pick up my room....but I don't know if I can lift it...*cymbal crash*....sorry....i know that was  really  corny.  I had a longer post, but my computer messed up and it erased it >_
