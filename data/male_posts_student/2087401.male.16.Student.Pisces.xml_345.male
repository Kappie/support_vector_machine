But it's also a query for information regarding the LN blog. I've got a bit of curiosity about this and a few concerns.  What is the name of the blog? Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title? Who is Joining the LN Blog? Is Nathan going to be admin? Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium? Is Marten Joining? If Marten is joining can I join?  When you get around to it, information about this would be greatly appreciated  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'
