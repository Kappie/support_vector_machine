Made my car go really fast on the road back. (Don't tell my mom. She'd hurt me.) Called Laura. Excerpt from the conversation here:   Laura:  would you get your butt over here?  Me:  what's over there?  Laura:  me!  Me:  sounds like a good reason to me..  Anyways.. it's moments like that when i wonder if there's something more to our relationship, or if it's just siblingly love. Laura confuses me sometimes, but i just buckle down and make a bad joke that she laughs at.  Anyways.. in reference to the food issue, i'm going to walmart, and i'll post later. bye now.
