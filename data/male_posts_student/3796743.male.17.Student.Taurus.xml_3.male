But lately this is how I've been looking at all the crap that happens in my life...look at life like its a war. It's quite simple. You've got to drop the bombs in the right place at the right time.  I'm thinking of shaking stuff up. Maybe cut off some dead weight. I do that every once in a while. I haven't done it since freshman year. I decide which of my friends I want to continue to be my friends. I got rid of quite a few freshman year, and I couldn't be happier with the results. I really think that it works. Look at every one of your relationships, and decide which of them are going in the direction that you think is right, and which ones contribute positively to your life. Then, you cut off all the rest. It sounds mean, but it really makes ya happier. Maybe, I'll start thinking about this again. Yep....thats cool huh?  In other news, today I did pretty much nothing. What a life huh? I woke up at like eleven, went to IHOP for breakfast/brunch and then did errands which suck, but whatever. Spent like $300 at the grocery store, cause I had no food here! But I bought a ton of Ben  Jerry's Brownie Batter! Best ever!   But on TV, there was footage of the Ronald Reagan funeral, and I got sad all of a sudden. That sucks. Oh well, now I'm watching Cops. That show is a white trash showcase. Hmmm....well one of the things I hate doing is packing. I hate it almost as much as I hate un-packing. But I gotta get ready for San Francisco....one more day! I can't wait, I haven't been on vacation in months! So adios!
