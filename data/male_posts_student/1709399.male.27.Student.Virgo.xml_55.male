There were some good write-ups on the Tourist Destinations in TN with some wonderful photographs. Its heartening to see that the TN Govt has become proactive in promoting Tourism in the State.                             However was suprised to see that a few big destinations were missing from the list ( Thiruvannamalai for instance) . Also there is no mention about the Wildlife Sanctuaries in TN ( Like Mundanthurai  Kalakkadu among others ) .
