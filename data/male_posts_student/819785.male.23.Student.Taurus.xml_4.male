Guess what, I can't figure it out.... maybe it's cos they were stupid or something? Never mind. Been having fun with the course so far, I live and breathe code so those aspects of it have been soooo easy to get my head round. Networks and Communications ain't quite so easy, but I think I'm even getting my head round that.  Oh well, limitations of the language aside, C is pretty cool. Can't wait to get onto C++, but I have to wait until next year for that. Shame really - I'm fairly sure they've got better string support!  We're all having a Halloween party over at Darron's. Fancy dress. Buggered if I know what I'm going as, guess if I didn't shave until then I could go as a werewolf.... but I don't think that'd be such a good idea, really, do you? Ah well it'll be a good night, loads of people have been invited, we're all going to get very very drunk and do silly things, and you can pretty much bet that the photos will end up online. I wouldn't mind setting up a webcam for it but people would probably object, or at best make obscene gestures to the camera.... actually that could be quite fun!  One of the other modules I'm learning here is Web Programming - covering Perl (which I think is a damn sight better than C, owing to it's scalar variables - if you don't know what that means, don't worry, it's not important). And I get 15MB of webspace on which I can run scripts..... hmmmm can anyone say testbed? Nowhere near enough to upload my photos and stuff, but at least I can check out the functions of the sites I'm working on before I pay out for a hosting package.  Also I get to open my Student Bank Account today. Going with Natwest, cos they offer the best deal by far. Can't say no to a £1250 interest-free overdraft.... and based on my projected spending for the next 5 years, I shouldn't even get that close to the limit, which also will rise each year. I think my maximum, or minimum depending on how you look at it, is going to be around £800, and then only at the end of each year when my Student Loan is all spent. See, going to uni needn't cost the Earth.... so long as you've got a part-time job - and how else did you think you were going to pay for your drunken parties?  It seems this post has turned into a completely freeform thing. I don't seem to be able to concentrate very well today, didn't sleep much last night. I'm probably coming down with something, it seems everyone else has been wiped out by a nasty bug the last couple of weeks, it's probably my turn now. Damned if it's going to stop me doing what I want though, only way that'll happen is if I literally can't move as a result.  Anyway enough weirdness for now, I'll probably post again later, when I'm sitting in my practical session for Web Programming - back to Perl again. I'd go for an early lunch but I have a meeting here at 1, so I've got to stick around for a while longer. Damn.  Later.....
