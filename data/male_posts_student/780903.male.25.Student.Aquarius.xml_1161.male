I have a marvelous idea for a post all about Tax, but not the energy to write it yet, so look for that later today or maybe tomorrow.  At some point in the next 24 hours I head back to NY for the summer, now that the weather has turned nice here in Cambridge.  There are people from my tax class without earshot in the library puzzling over something I should be puzzling over but instead am writing a weblog post.  Oh well.  We have 4 hours, I have the tax code, I have my notes, if I can't find it and figure it out during the exam, well, then I deserve whatever grade I get.  Like that excuse as to why I'm not puzzling over the interaction between 1231 and 1245 and 1221?  Yeah, me neither.  I think I'm going to press "publish" and start puzzling.
