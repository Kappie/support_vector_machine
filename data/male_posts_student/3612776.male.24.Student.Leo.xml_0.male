Sure, I should be downstairs in my bed with my laptop typing away...I have a paper that's due on Monday for PLE.  Ah, I'll start that tomorrow night after I get back to Rochy! :-P  Home...I came home for Father's Day and mom's birthday (it'll be on Tues.)  Found out that we were invited to a high school graduation party...so of course, being the nice family, we went--UP IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THE MOQUITOS ARE.  I sat there, swatting my legs and smiling at everyone--no clue what they were saying! My brother, the idiot he is, FINALLY showed up from MA at 5 pm, just when we were about to leave to meet Granny for dinner.  So behold it, we didn't leave until 5:45 pm, and knowing how Granny is...eek, we speeded to dinner.  It was lovely, at the Freehold Inn...quite nice and expensive!  Now, we're home...Andrew's back to MA, of course.    Home...it used to be "home sweet home" and I couldn't wait to get there.  Now, it's "ehh, home".  Things have changed a lot over the past 3 years...mostly becuz of the relationship I'm in...but ah, my parents have to accept that I'm HAPPY and it's the guy I'm going to marry.  My parents are not marrying him...so be it!  Whatever.  Now I dread coming home since I know mom'll say something (or should I say some thingS) negative and I just have to nod and ingore it.  Me tired..me going to bed now.  YAWN!  Good night! Ta-Ta Brooke
