Before i start off with todays happenin', let me tell ya all that u hve to follow science lab rules. if not, this might happen to u...  7 july 2004, SMK SBU Science Lab *what lab is it again?* - Lai Sue Sein, 2A, has broken the most disasterous accidents record...by making a flamethrower out of a bunsen burner by accident. 2A thanks Adam Akmal for putting out the fire using wet cloth.  So, dont make this mistake again. thk god no one was injured, including the lab.  ok back to 2day. early morning a gal from ed. board went into our library to get photos of us boys. hahha it's gonna come out in the skool mag. well..the main focus was 2day's st. john class. wong ai lynn really smacked me by shutting my mouth everytime she asks a question to us recruits. dunno y...jus trying to answer. maybe she thought i answer enough correctly. let the other recruits do the *umm......* thats' all i wanna say i guess.  cheerio!
