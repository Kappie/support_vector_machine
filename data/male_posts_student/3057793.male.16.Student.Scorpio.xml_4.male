HAhahaha... then shaun told me it is not... one more day to school reopen. i'll start with bio first ba... found out that my Gippy Times's still in the locker at sch.. donno whether to go back and take. Lazy to go out.. Still muz wear sch attire... anyway monday also got time ... :P haha...  The soccer match last night between FRANCE and GREECE was really once in a life time thingy... France team... which was once a champion team and won most of the matches... actually lost to GREECE~!! Hahahaha.... unbelievable lor.... Greece was so lousy for the earlier matches!... hei ma....  what puzzzzles myself alot is the sudden interest in the results of these soccer matches.... not exactly is how the ball got kicked in or who kicked in at which interval and the which minute stuff.... it's quite fun predicting the results and analyzing who could be the ultimate winner...:) felt that maintaining and updating a blog is not easy... still have to squeeze out time for studying and doing other stuff... quite hard. but i'll try.
