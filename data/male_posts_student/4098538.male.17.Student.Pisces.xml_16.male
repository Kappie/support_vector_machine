We got there at like 8pm, had lots of beer then had a little 'jamming' session and it went alright seeing as we were all a bit mashed! We did some Lostprophets, Misfits, Korn, One Minute Silence and some other random crap. Then we had a 'waterfall' bong and I cleared all 3 of my turns, go me. That was the point where things started getting weird. I don't really remember too much after this. Apparently, Amanda took me to bed 'cause I was in a pretty bad state and I told her I'd go look for her phone because she had lost it. She come down a while later to find me asleep, and she woke me up. She asked me to go look for it so I stumbled into the living room andwalked back out claiming I had searched the living room. Then she asked me her number and I said I don't know it. Then a few minutes later I said I did, and typed 103 into a phone and said "I don't know how this thing works!"... so I was pretty bad. Then we had a massive hug in the kitchen and I fell asleep on her shoulder, and woke up asking what the tap was doing in the sink... yeah. All of this (by the way) is stuff I have been told, I don't remember any of it. Stuff I do remember... not a lot. I remember making mini-pancakes with syrup and standing in doggy piss! I have been pretty ill the last few days too, I think it was a dodgy burger I ate on Saturday...
