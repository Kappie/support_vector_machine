If you want a  private  typed record of your thoughts, for whatever reason, buy  Word Perfect  or  Word 2000  (Hell, I'll burn you a copy of either if you ask nicely) but don't have a blog.  Blogs are for instigating conversation  with people  and continuing communication  with people  or to simply  exhibit yourself  to the public at large .  So unless you got a few other people  inside  you then a blog better be for doing all of the above with other people  outside  yourself.    Now maybe I'm missing the whole point of blogging, but isn't having a secret blog like having a walkman but no headphones?  That's dumb.  I'll concede that the blog hunt is an interesting idea but not to me.
