Something about cheat heat. Don't understand  -->played bball with the usual gang. A bunch of idiots stole the court from us.  -->Rain poured, we went to under the blocks to shelter. Talk, then played Captain's Ball.     -->SL came. Gave out prezzies.   -->Hann lost ball. Can't find. Decided that it was stolen.  -->We went to eat. We discussed about things. I finished Reader's Digest.  -->Gloria gave me a Christmas prezzie. It was a candle holder with some candles. YaY! I always wanted a candle holder! No more using plates to put candles in. YaY! Thanks Gloria.  -->In the midst of reading Wendy's book. It's quite a meaningful book. I like it.... Will give a complete review after finishing it.   -->Gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
