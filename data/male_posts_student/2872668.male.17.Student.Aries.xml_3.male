This sounds like nonsensical rambling, since i'm supposed to like her...to love her, even. And perhaps I do. But i know i cant. Thats why i planted an artificial feeling of hate in my heart, to fight back the intense feelings i have for her.  Just talked to her over msn. Seems she likes the music of Midnight Garden, Hymm and Winter. Never heard of them tho....ha. She lamented abt her paintin cip...lucky i finished my 80 hrs already, yea.   'gd nite, sleep tight, and dun let the bed bug bite'...she's the second gal to say it to me...it triggered some vague memories n emotions in my mind. I...realli have to further reinforce the wall of hate in my heart, before im hurt...again...   Let amnesia strike thy lovesick heart, may thy mind lie within poppy field; for though the feelings of love be stark, requited affections shalt be few.
