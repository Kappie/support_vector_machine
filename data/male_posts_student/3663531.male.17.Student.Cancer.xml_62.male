But now I realise, that practially no one likes you anyway, so just do whatever pops into your head at convinient opportunities.  So, go ahead, bugger up society even more by being weird! At least most of us will be happy! Or insane! But I reckon insane people are happy in their insane world most of the time, so try being insane for a while!!!!!
