My computer has been virused all to hell.  Therefore, until I get this shit fixed, IRC and all of my IM's have been uninstalled untill I can cough up some dough to have a professional grade firewall coming into the house.    Anyway, to my main man Pete "The Sneaky Cheat", I want to say "Thank You" for giving me the oppurtunity to distribute my wrestling drivel around the world, via this blog.     Now shut up and read on, you sick freak...   In 2004, I want to see:   Shawn Micheals get a lengthy run with the World Title : Man, that last RAW show of 2003 gave us an awesome Main Event between HBK and HHH.  The ending may have been a bit controversial, but it truly elevated Shawn as the #1 babyface on the RAW roster.  Talk about your comebacks.  He was supposedly done after his back surgery in '97.  When he came back part-time last year none of us expected him to be anything more than a p/t player.  Not only did he get a brief run with the belt at the end of last year, he's managed to pull off incredible matches with nearly every heel on the RAW roster in '03.  His match with Chris Jericho at WrestleMania XIX was so good that my good friend Xine, who was at my place that night even got off the computer long enough to watch it.  Micheals is back and let him have the ball while HHH is filming Blade III.   More attention given to the US and Intercontinental Titles:    Back in the day, the secondary titles were nearly as big a deal as the World titles in their promotions.  Now that WWE has both titles in two brands, let's make it a real competition for those straps.  Instead of passing around the belts like a drunk girl at a frat party, let's make it a big deal to win that title.  On RAW, they're starting to turn the corner by making Randy Orton's IC win a big deal.  SmackDown! could really benefit by having Chris Benoit and John Cena feud over the US title as well.     Less McMahons:  'Nuff said.  It just occurred to me that the New Year was rung in a few minutes ago.  Isn't that something?  I spent my final minutes of 2003 and my first few minutes of 2004 writing a wrestling column.   Obviously, 2003 was a rough year for yours truly, so send some good karma my way for 2004.
