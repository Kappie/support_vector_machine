Everything's fine, we're all alright, we'll survive We're probably all just in denial Can't accept the truth of our reality We don't cry 'cause we can't stop the smile The whisper of an endless dream An echo of a thought Striving for things we don't understand Trying to be what we're not Swallow your empty, meaningless words Swallow foolish pride and vanity Face the facts of your inevitable demise And look towards the coming calamity My mind is stretched broader than the horizon It can accomodate all of existence Wave a magic wand at my life Erase the pain and resistance.  That ought to be enough of that for one day.  I find myself worn out lately, like I've been stretched too thin across too many fronts.  Maybe I should take my lesson from the Germans and not fight wars on two fronts, metaphorically speaking.  I feel almost transparent, as though someone could look through me and see out the other side if I weren't wearing clothes (don't worry, I don't plan on running around naked anytime soon...not as cold as it suddenly is).  I'm trying to do too much, I guess, but that's where it's odd--I'm not really getting anything accomplished, it seems.  Quite the predicament, really.  I guess you could classify this as some sort of psychological cry for help.  I tend to think of it more as a cry for alcohol and a good night's rest.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Electric Light Orchestra, "Easy Money"
