Hmmm, for wad i know, I didn't study for Chinese and only read through about a few pages of Chemistry notes. That's all the preparation I made for the exams today. Lol. Maths paper tomorrow. Gonna feel damn sick cause I hate Maths. =/ As usual, I chill around wif my classmates to "study" but end up eating in the canteen. ^^ I reached home at about 5pm and started sleeping. Zzzzz.... Woke up at 7.30pm to eat my DINNER!! I'm feeling sleepy again... Haiz. How on Earth am I gonna study Maths in this manner? Well, i guess this Mid-Year Exams wouldn't really help me in my promotion exams at the end of the year. Just hope a small miracle would happen. Well, I always believe that some things are just fated. Though we can manipulate fate in some manner, still, fate plays a major role in our lives. Guess I'm gonna start "reading" Maths before i fail my Maths and get OWNED by my bunny-teeth Maths teacher... Gayguy. =(
