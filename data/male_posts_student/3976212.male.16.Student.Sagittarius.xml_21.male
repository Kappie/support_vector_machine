It looks quite informative and professional, I even included work I did for the school almost three years ago for 2 weeks. Mwahaha whatever I worded things very proffesionaly and all. What else? Well my grandmother said that my dad can come and pick up all our stuff including my router! So soon y'all can be listening to my fav songs broadcasting at 128kbps stereo mp3 shoutcast radio sound music! hehe. Actually, last time my file exchange service (similar to kazaa except all the stuff was hosted in my server) was the most popular feature of my site. It got overloaded, people abused it, but I managed to overcome those obsticals with more power and space. My family got fucked up, all my money was stolen and I wasn't able to continue to offer the service. Now I can! yay! Besides that, I've been doing nothing but sleeping, chatting and well yeah thats about it! mwahaha. I really need some good drugs to pass the time ;-(.) yummy drugs! ;-)
