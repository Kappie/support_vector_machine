I would make an epic post about how I loved Italy, but I won't.  I will make my daily post and at the end write about something that happened one day of the trip.  I will start tomorrow at the first day and post every day's events until I reach the end.  As for today's events, I woke up at 10:00 after sleeping 13 hours.  My room is the messiest room ever witnessed by mankind.  It's terrible.  Yeah, I guess I have to clean my own room again.  I wish I was in Italy.  I had practice today and there was only three of us there so there was nothing to do.  We shot at goal and stuff.  Then we ran by the cheerleaders.  That was my idea of course.  Then we worked on trapping and played some poker and went home.  I went to Chicago Dough for some pizza.  It felt great to have American pizza again.  Pizza in Italy is very plain.  The  Margherita  pizza is a thin layer of dough with crushed tomato sauce and cheese.  That's it.  So naturally I ordered a pizza today with everything on it.  Mmmmm... heavenly!  Also my favourite waitress took our order.  She was the waitress for my wild 16th b-day party.  That was a great time so whenever we see each other we are always nice to each other.  I also had McDonald's today.  It felt great to have a greasy, fatty, unhealthy double cheeseburger with super salty fries.  It was glorious.  That's all for now because I am so very tired.  More tomorrow.
