While I've read several postings, it's very likely that I may unintentionally repeat something. After all, I haven't been here as long as the rest of you.   For now, I'll hold off on my comments regarding Iraq, just because I'm pretty confident that that topic has been brought up a lot already.  For my first contribution, here are a few talking points regarding our President. (Note: It is not out of sloth that I don't bother to spell out his full title, "President-elect." I just call 'em as I see 'em.)    *When asked in 1999 about his alleged cocaine use, he responded that he has had "no felonies in the last 25 years." What do you suppose that tells you about his life prior to 1975?  *He's been arrested three times, including a time in 1976 when he was found DUI. I'm not saying that something that happened twenty-four years before his campaign for President should keep him from running for office. I just wonder why he and everyone involved in his campaign lied about it and covered up the truth for so long. Al Gore was man enough to admit that he had smoked pot as a teenager, and he still managed to get 500,000 more individual votes than Bush.  *Later on, when people found out why he really was arrested in 1976 (drunk driving, not "driving too slow" like he proclaimed), he responded "It was back in my youth." His youth? He was 30!  As for stuff that happened after within the first few months after he took office:  *"It's amazing I won. I was running againnst peace, prosperit, and incumbency." -George W. Bush, July 14, 2001. Speaking to Swedish Prime Minister Goran Perrson, unaware that a live TV camera was still rolling.  All kinds of funding cuts: *Cut $35 million in funding for advanced pediatric training for doctors. *Cut $39 million from federal spending on libraries.  Fun side-note:  He actually proposed eliminating the "Reading is Fundamental" program, which gives free books to poor children. *Cut funding for research into cleaner, more efficient cars and trucks by 28%. *Reduced, by 86%, the Community Access Program, which coordinated care for people without health insurance among hospitals, clinics, and other health care providers. *Cut funding for the Girls and Boys Clubs of America programs in public housing by $60 million. *Cut $200 million from workforce training programs for dislocated workers. *Cut $200 million from the Childcare and Development grant, a program that provides child care to low-income families as they are forced from welfare to work. *Cut $700 million dollars in funds for public housing repairs. *Cut $500 million from the Environmental Protection Agency's budget. *Cut $15.7 million from programs dealing with child abuse and neglect.  Among his broken campaign promises: *He did not invest $100 million per year in rain forest conservation *He has not regulated carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to global warming.  Fun side-note:  He actually pulled America  out  of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol agreement on global warming, ultimately signed by 178 other countries  Ooh, and here's a goody: He denied college financial aid to students convicted of misdemeanor drug charges, though convicted murderers are still eligible.  Yes, all of that happened just within the first few months of his administration, but he still managed to spend 42% of his first seven months on vacation.   Any rebuttles?
