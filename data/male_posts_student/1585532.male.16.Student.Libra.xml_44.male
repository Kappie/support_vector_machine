After trying to restore it, it corrupted again.  I eventually gave up on it.  But that doesn't mean that there's nothing new on the site.  I managed to do one thing already in 2004 that I promised.   urlLink New Messageboards.   So now you can post to your heart's delight in a decent looking forum instead of that pile of crap I used to have.  Okay, so what's new?  Well I went to Knott's yesterday, that was tons of fun.  For once, HOLY CRAP!  NO CROWDS!  I was half expecting a bunch of people there for some reason.  Probably since I had to put up with all those tards during the holiday rush.  So, I get to the park, empty blah blah.  None of my friends are around thanks to school.  Thought it was going to be an entirely boring day all-together.  WRONG!  Mid-day I meet up with some Australian kids on Ghostrider, we all ended up hanging around with each other and I showed them some things I know about the park, and showed them DDR, which was hilarious because I was limping it since I bruised my knee and I still think a few people were amazed.  Great day, hopefully I'll talk to a few of them via internet soon.  They actually took a liking to me I think, and they said I was the most "Aussie" person they've met in the US.  (aka, I'm not some tight-ass that'll sue at the drop of a pin on my foot.)  I poked fun at a few things and did my "Ahhh-nold" impression, along with a few others.  After that we all chatted about how strange the US is, and I got to talk to them about Australia.  Being a person who actually studies other countries, I amazed them with a few things that I knew about Australia that would normally go over an American's head.  They're going to hit Disneyland soon they said, and good luck to them.  That place is probably  still  a holiday hell hole.  Overall, that day was one of the best days I've had at Knott's in a long time.  Though I'm still waiting for Halloween Haunt...  Well, that about does it, I'm gonna get back to my new message board.  -Signoff-
