I knew most of what I had gained before was water from Darien Lake and whatnot, but a day of fasting sure kicks things off.  I got 2 more DVDs out.  Only something like 30 to go.  Laura visited me at work, she brought a pamphlet for jobs in the DC area.  She's got my future all planned out. :)  We went back to my place and hung out until Cindy got done with work.  We then headed to a fabric store in Henrietta.  Cindy needed supplies, I needed material for a tablecloth.  Laura is sewing it for me.  All the while I was doing laundry at UR.  I've discovered my cat likes to break everything I own, walk on everything I have and eat anything I have in reach.  She also stinks to high heaven (her litter box) even though I clean it several times a week.  I think I need a new litter.  Several fish died today.  A shame really, but what did I expect with such a small tank.  Yes folks, I admit it, I have a small fish tank.   Cindy and I hung out forever and watched Footloose.  We're having a picnic tomorrow at the lake with Laura and Luke, so thats all good.  My aunt called and let me know that we're going to the casino on Saturday, a picnic for my cousin in 2 weeks and also going to the racino in Farmington a week from today.  Lots to do in the coming week.  Ont he way to drop Cindy off, we figured out how to lose 20 pounds for me and 40 pounds for Cindy.  We'll be cutting off limbs, shaving our hair off, donating as much blood as possible, and a cease of any food or drink.  Kidding of course, but it was a funny conversation:  Cindy: I could cut my breasts off. Luke: If you did that, even I'D lose weight. Audience: Hahahahaha.... (sigh)  Good night.
