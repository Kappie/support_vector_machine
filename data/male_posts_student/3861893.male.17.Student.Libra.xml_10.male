Saw a couple of blogs lately and developed this sudden urge to create a blog where I can express myself freely. Haha. I'm kinda new in this area, and could do with some expert advice. If you have any precious advice, please don’t hesitate to contact me.  Well, what shall I say? Guess I should start with a little introduction about myself. Kwok Siong is my name. Some people call me by my initials KS, while others call me Siew. Closer people also know me by Mungyo. Many people have asked me what does the word Mungyo mean and what kinda word is that. Basically, all I have to say is this: I don't know the meaning of this word! Saw this word somewhere and thought that it was a nice word. So, I took the word and started using it ever since. I don’t know what it means, but who cares anyway.    What are my interests? Actually I enjoy watching soccer. Haha. Who doesn't? Many think that soccer is a stupid game with twenty two people chasing after one stupid ball. But actually I think if you really sit down and watch, you would enjoy watching soccer. Since we are at it, let me give you my two cents worth on soccer. This is my world XI, following a 4-4-2 formation.   Goalkeeper: Gianluigi Buffon (he's the best in the world)  Left Back: Roberto Carlos (he's a defender but also adds strength to the attack)  Right Back: Lilian Thuram (need I say more?)  Centre Defender: Alessandro Nesta (I love him!)  Centre Defender: Marcel Desailly (they called him the rock)  Left Midfield: Pavel Nedved (he's the champion)  Right Midfield: Robert Pires (provided he doesn't go around diving)  Centre Midfield: Zinedine Zidane (legendary footballer)  Centre Midfield: Patrick Vieira (he's got the determination)  Centre Forward: Ronaldo (fat but fast)  Centre Forward: David Trezeguet (you may dispute this, but he's still good)  And the manager who's worthy to lead this team is none other than Fabio Capello. He is the only person in the entire world who is worthy to lead this team. He is a master strategist and knows how to change the game. Just look at how he changed Roma from a team of losers to title challengers.  Okay, that's about all now. Bye.
