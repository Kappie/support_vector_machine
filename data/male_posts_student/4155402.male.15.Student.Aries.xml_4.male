Maybe frm today onwards we will not talk to each other... (i hope not.. haizz) i think im so dumb.. to tell her that i like her when it is shown so clearly she likes someone else.. i just had to get it off my chest.. i did feel a little better than but now i regret telling her that i like her. this maybe the ending of our fragile friendship.. haiz.. meeting zh later to walk round 201 to get over her.. but i know it will not work and i think zh is the oni one who can accompany me thru tis.. i think i'll be gay if the blow is too hard for me.. haha (juz kidding la) hope we still can be friends even though she doesnt fancy me.. I still like her though... haha.. blog some other day ba.. Adios ~ :+: HoPeFuL :+: bB^rAnDy :+: HoPeFuL :+:
