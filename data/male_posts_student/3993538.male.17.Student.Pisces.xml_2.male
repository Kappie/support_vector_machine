Would last forever So where did things go wrong What happened that made things fall apart Why I just don't know It's so hard to let go of someone... I used to call my own  But I'll find a way I'll get over you one day I'll find a way I'm gonna deal with all this pain I'll find a way' Cause I know that somewhere... My soul mate is waiting for me Gonna make it through the day I'll find a way  Silence gets so intense... Without you to share a word I really miss your presence... This loneliness feels awkward But I won't call you... I refuse I'd rather lay here by myself in the dark... Crying my heart out I wish these tears could erase... All the memories of you but they can't  But I'll find a way I'll get over you one day I'll find a way I'm gonna deal with all this pain I'll find a way' Cause I know that somewhere... My soul mate is waiting for me Gonna make it through the day I'll find a way  'Cause what hurts today... In time will fade away When you told me goodbye... I felt so betrayed Find the courage... To move on One day I'll replace... The precious love I lost
