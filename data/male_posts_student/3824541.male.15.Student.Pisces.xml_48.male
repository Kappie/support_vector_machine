We made it to the last Sigma stage, and HUZZAH! we beat the Sigma virus. Thank god. I've had that game since like 1995, and it's finally been beaten. Notice how I said  it's finally been beaten  instead of "I finally beat it." I didn't complete the game. Randy did :(. Go Randy!  Idaho has no meaning whatsoever... (continued)   Speaking of completing things, I completed the  Nectar in a Sieve  homework. Soon I'll have to start 'The Odyssey.' bleh. Sparknotes seems good about now. I might end up using them. I can't decide.  ...and was previously suggested as a name for several other states.  Something I've decided: I'm going to start some sort of daily thingy in my blog. Who knows what the hell it'll be. If I had ideas for  Red Dress  I'd post new scenes each day. I'm thinking of starting a photography type thing, and I'll post my pictures here.  Scroll down a bit and look to the right.  BTW, now that I think about it, I do have a scene for Red Dress. The conclusion of Valentina's story. A big wedding is going on, and she interrupts it with tears coming down her face. I'm not telling why yet ;/. If you are interested in  Red Dress , leave a comment or something.  One more thing to discuss. Mugglenet is having a Harry Potter contest. I think the artwork is really good so I'm hoping some of my readers will vote. I voted for number three.

Jason and Mike I've known since I moved here, and Randy is from the bus.   .Music  Sugarcult - I'm bouncing off the walls
