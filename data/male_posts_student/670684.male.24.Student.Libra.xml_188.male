There's not much, but I'm going through and looking at all of the shit I didn't unpack and wondering why I keep hauling it to places if I'm never going to use it, and once I get it out I see it's all notes from the past:  journals, stories, film ideas, even some music.  And I read it, and look at the pictures, and feel it in my hand and try to remember where I wrote it; the only one I can remember is a silent play I wrote in 1998 on a Delta flight from Dallas to San Diego that involved Ken Scruggs as a jealous boyfriend, acting to the tune of a Kitaro masterpiece.  Seat 24F, and I didn't write that down on the cocktail napkin.    I found a shoebox full of baseball cards I collected years ago; at the time I took all the good ones and gave them protective sleeves and put them in one box...these were the leftovers that mingled freely with the other dregs.  Every time I run acoss these, I look through them and see if I recognize any of the names; if I do, I take them out and save them.  The last time I did that was before I went off to college.  I remember at the time looking at the cards, most from 1991 or 1992, and thinking that they would never appreciate.  I found 10 cards of current superstars as I dug through the cast-offs today; at the time of the card, these players were beginners.  Today they're thinking about retiring.    An attractive girl from Singapore was at the apartment this evening, discussing the heterogeneity of rural Wisconsin and assuming that the Japanese girl across the way from us was more Oriental than she.  We talked about school and Singapore and roommates whose boyfriends wear speedos, and got around to my time in undergrad and what I was doing now at 23.  "How old are you?"  I asked.  "20," she sighed.  "I don't want to be older."  "23 isn't that old," I said, suddenly panicked and looking for reassurance.  None provided.  She stood, lean and energetic.  I slouched, fat and ready for a beer and nap.    The key isn't fighting to reclaim youth -- I watched some PBS Kids show today where the kids designed wood cars and rockets and raced them at national competitions; I never got to do that, and I'll never have the chance -- but to work to make these days better than the ones before.  I read some psychology article saying that our adult lives are spent reconciling childhood issues and abandonments; if I am to believe that, I need to get out and reconcile rather than lament the issues.  I go into every year saying that it will be better than the last one.  The first year where that wasn't the case was May 2001 - May 2002 (my life revolves around the academic calendar).  This past year was about as good as 2000-2001, maybe a bit less.  I'm determined that this next year will break the streak.
