For a while there, the brand was in the doldrums, post Wrestlemania, due in part to Brock's departure, Angle's injury, and too green an undercard.  Then of course came JBL's push/title win...  Anyway, Smackdown seems like it's coming back into its own as of recent events.  JBL, oddly enough, is managing to pull off the heel Champion a bit.  He's not "there" yet, but he's getting closer.  It looks like he'll have a decent buildup going into SummerSlam against the Undertaker.  One of the reasons I'm starting to buy into the JBL character as a credible heel has a lot to do with my burning desire to see Bush/Cheney go in November.  Bradshaw makes it a point to come across as the neo-conservative, racist, money-bagged asshole that embodies the current administration.  (A case could also be made that Bradshaw's title win was fishy at best, just like Dubya/Cheney's "victory" in 2000.)  But that's another Blog (I just started a new one dedicated to this years elections, http://www.usorthem.blogspot.com )  Anyway, I got to thinking tonight about some fueds of the future. The beauty of the brand extension (which many wrestling pundits hate, I personally love), is that you can hold off certain money feuds until both wrestlers are big enough money draws to pull it off.  Therefore, I'd like to see in the next year or two:   John Cena vs. Randy Orton  These two are the future of the WWE.  The next Shawn Micheals  Bret Hart.  One day down the road, they'll find themselves on the same roster and headline a Wrestlemania together.  Not to mention that they both debuted around the same time, and my wrestling-fan-ex-girlfriend's nipples would pop out any time one of those guys came to the ring.    Hurricane vs. Rey Mysterio  Mild-mannered reporter Gregory Helms' alter-ego The Hurricane has been horribly under-utilized on RAW.  During the post WrestleMania Fantasy Draft, I was rooting for Sugar Shane to go to SmackDown! to finally be able to compete for the Cruiserweight belt.  He's the second best cruiserweight on both rosters.  Sadly, 'Cane got left behind on the RAW roster only to be a constant jobber to Kane, et al. I say let the Hurricane compete for the Cruiserweight title.  The matchup has so much drawing potential that the writers wouldn't even have to turn one of them heel.  Just give the match a proper PPV push and let them go nuts for 20 minutes in the ring.  This matchup would also help WWE's ailing house show attendance.  No one is lining up to see Rey Rey vs. Chavo jr. for the umpteenth time.     Batista vs. Brock Lesnar  By all press reports, it appears Brock Lesnar's chances of signing with an NFL franchise is slim (although, I do have him as a linebacker on my Chargers team on Madden '04).  Brock pissed a lot of people off by quitting like he did a few weeks before WrestleMania.  He decided he wanted to persue his dream of being an NFL player, despite the fact that he hadn't played football since High School.  (To be fair, he was an All-State HS football player during his Senior year.)  Barring some desparate team like the Lions looking for a quick ticket draw (ala aged Joe Montana going to the Cheifs in '94), it looks like Brock will have to return to the business that he had already earned 10 Million dollars from.  Would WWE be willing to welcome him back?  Of course!  Would Brock get the same "Superman push" he got the first time around?  Hell no!  Vince would gladly take Brock back, but Brock might have to do some jobs to the likes of Jamie Noble and Tyson Tomko.  The way they're pushing Batista these days, like the behemoth that he is, he'd be a natural opponent for Brock, once he comes back and gets back in good graces.  Who comes out on top of that feud is anyone's guess, though.  (Side note:  Brock Lesnar may actually become the very first member of the OFFSCREEN Vince McMahon Kiss-My-Ass-Club.)   Ric Flair vs. Bret Hart  Actually, I'm going to make a separate blog entry on this whole ruckus.  Apparently, The Nature Boy badmouthed the HitMan in his book (which I haven't read yet), and now the whole IWC (Internet Wrestling Community) is abuzz with debate on the topic of who was better.  And lastly, the Ultimate feud I'd like to see in the ring:   Pedro "Admiral" Stockdale vs. The Almighty Drewcifer  That's right, WeeWee, I'm calling you out!  Not that you'll get in the ring with me, cuz you aint got the nards!  You heard me! You call me an old thirty-something, and you may be right, but I can still take your pubescant ass to that mat and make you tap, just like I tapped your mama the other night!  What?  Yeah, you heard me, little man!  C'mon! Your sister tapped, too!  Whoo!  I'm so filled with hellfire, you'll get burned just by laying a finger on me!  I'm like the Sun...the World revolves around me, and I'm way too hot to touch!  Yeah, C'mon!!!
