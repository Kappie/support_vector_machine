The whole time was just really natural and felt right. You know how you are in the first few days of a relationship with someone you really like? Well, things are like that after 6 months. I still feel the same way. I'm not bored at all! But she's got a new job in a pub and that'd kinda annoyed me. I just don't fancy the idea of her being around a load of drunk guys on a Saturday night... but oh well. I had a pretty funny conversation with her earlier. I was like, 'Yeah, I'd still love you even if you had no arms and legs and you was just a stump with a head', and I was going on about all the fun things I could do, like throw her onto a bouncy castle with a load of kids jumpin' on it - she'd be fucked! Hahaha. Sorry. God I'm an idiot. Been listening to some new stuff this week - Cannae, Dillinger Escape Plan, Bleeding Through, Sworn Enemy, From Autumn To Ashes, Atreyu, As I Lay Dying... and some others. I'm hungry.
