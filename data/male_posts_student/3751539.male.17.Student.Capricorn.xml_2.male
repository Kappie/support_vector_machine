It basically gave the guidelines for having a productive and useful argument.  It pointed out that in order to have a beneficial and non-contentious argument, you need to have a higher goal than winning the argument.  You must be seeking for the truth.  An argument should be a journey for all involved, not a battle.  This requires being humble (teachable).  Also, arguments go easier when they are motivated by hope, not anger.  Anger, or anything that looks like anger, has no place in a constructive argument.  It is not necessary.  There are ways of being firm about your opinion without being angry (Mormon missionaries).  While arguing, you must always respect the person you are arguing with.  He/She is a person too, with life experiences, knowledge, and potential.  Gordon B. Hinckley in a speech that I read encouraged BYU students to discuss and debate.  It is a necessary part of coming to understand our society and eternal truths, and there is something extremely central about understanding.
