I was the designated 'ride with audree (my 5yrold cousin)' person on the carnival rides, and as you know, all of the rides at a carnival go in circles, so i was feelin a little queasy.  I's all good now.  I got a bag o that kettle corn stuff (very good...why else would you go to a fair/carnival thing?).  We saw the balloons fly in and the illumination thing.  I had to drive myself there and back (darn...heh).  People are very impatient.  Oh well.  So, i think we're going to Canoe Country on monday afternoon if i can get ahold of everyone.  I'll see how goes it.
