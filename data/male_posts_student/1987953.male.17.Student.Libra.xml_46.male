I have waited so long to blog because everything is piling up... 7-8 hours at school everyday, 7-8 hours at work four times a week, church, and everything all at once. School started up again and I have finals next week. I will be able to blog, however, because I go to school at 9:45 to be there and in class by 10:10 during finals week. I have a lot of time in the morning I can find to blog. It will be fun! So anyway, I have to go. Tell me about something though, just for curiosity: Most likely I will be getting my grandmother's car when i graduate because she can no longer drive. Her car is a gray/silver Mercury Mystique, made by Ford. Its exterior is identical to  urlLink this . What do you think? I intend to get my own, nicer car when money lets me get a good one. In the meantime, my first car will be my grandmother's car which I will fix up a little, get professionally cleaned, some small things fixed, and put a CD player in (all of which my grandmother didn't want to do or wouldn't do). It'll be pretty nice for now. What do you all think about it honestly? Anyway, blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
