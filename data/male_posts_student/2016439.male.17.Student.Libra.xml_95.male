It's so nice to return to the country after living in the "big city" (What? Did I say that?) for so long.  As usual, it was a pleasant trip.  I love it when I go down there: the two great-aunts who hold down the fort at our family ranch could easily take care of my weight gain streak.  Even when you're full to the brim, they always insist that you eat more just because you're a "growing child."  Haha.  Yes, Aunt Rose, I'm nearly 18 and in danger of being malnourished.  Good times, good times.  The highlight of the trip was when we discovered the PS2 stowed away in the Old House (the ranch is composed of two connected houses: the Old House and--you guessed it--the New House).  It was a ninja game, and a strange one at that.  There was no hand-to-hand combat.  It used a gun similar to the one from Duck Hunt way back in The Day, and for the life of her, my mother couldn't figure it or the game out.  Example:  MOM: Am I killing them? ME: No, Mom.  They're killing you. MOM:  Okay...well, have I hit one yet? ME:  No, Mom.  You're still shooting at the painting above the TV. MOM:  Oh, okay.  *pause*  Okay, now am I hitting them? ME:  Mom, you haven't even changed the angle of your gun.  Aim  at  the TV. MOM:  Okay.  *pause*  All right, now am I hitting them? ME:  Where are your glasses, Mom? MOM:  Wait, I think I got one! ME:  No, Mom.  They just got you.  Gotta luv generation gaps within my family.  My great-aunts still haven't seen the light of day with a computer.  They're still in awe of the brand-new plasma TV the family just bought for them, but they don't know how to work it.  They always get Alfred, the ranch-hand, to work it.  They still call the DVD player a CD player and a CD player a record player.  Good times, good times.  Tomorrow is important on two accounts: 1) newspaper camp--I get to see the oh-so-pregnant Mrs. B and her minions...er, students.  It'll be fun to see who's coming on staff for next year, but it'll be hard to even hold a candle to this past year's.  I completed my packet for the first time ever.  Yay!  2) After that, it's off to the orthodontist for me!  If you don't know what that means, shame on you.  You should know by now.  I should be looking quite different by the time school rolls around.  Mmm...I'm still not sure about this whole thing.  Let's hope it works out for the best.
