I would like that every user has his own account but if there are problems I will give out the other login. Also I made Adam and Tim admins on the website so they can also sign up people and do other stuff. Last thing about the name now its "Cava and other luxuries" but if you have a better idea please docomment, also the about the subtitle "Barcelona unofficial fan club".    Ok about my life, last week I went golfing for the first time in something like 8 years. I went with a friend of mine who's brother is a professional golfer. I did ok, had quite a few good strokes but in between I had terrible ones, so the total was about180 strokes on 18 holes. Quite fun I think Ill start golfing now, regularly.    The weekend was as sweet as can be, I haven't had so much fun for weeks. I first went to a move-in party where I drank my Estrella Damm beer and spoke mostly about football with my friend from school because I didn't know much people there.    Later I went to a birthday of an acquaintance of mine it was also very fun but there I spoke to this Indian-American guy (you can guess if I spoke about one particularfriend of mine).Also there is this one guy I know a bit and we always talks to me while drinking and we always talk about the same thing and nothing new ever comes up... rather boring. After the party I went downtown and in the line of the most popular bar around here but they have terribly long line so I 'bailed' with a girl I worked with. I went to another bar which I usually don't go, there I met my cousin, three people I work with and other friends. To was so strange because usually I don't meet that many people I know. One of the girls I work with is so pretty and I hope that we can go on a date soon, the  move  is on the books.    So now I'm just working not to much fun... but when the weekend comes...
