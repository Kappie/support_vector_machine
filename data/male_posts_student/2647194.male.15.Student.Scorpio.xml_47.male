I don’t believe in the idea of giving something up for lent as self-sacrifice. Instead, I think that people should give up their time (well, maybe do give something up…lol) to serve and help other people. You give up something to better yourself, right? So then give up your time and energy to do something good, which inherently makes you a better person, and it helps out others too to make them feel better during lent. That’s my theory, so critique me if you’d like. On another religious note, my feelings on The Passion of the Christ: agh!!!! Sure, the evangelicals (who happen to be crazed conservatives) praise its graphic representation of “how it was” for Jesus on the cross, crucifixion, etc. This movie has way too much f%^ hype and publicity for what it offers. I myself have not seen it, and I don’t plan to. Ever. Instead of showing the violence and hatred of the time, why not show all of the good things Jesus did? This is just another reason why I don’t particularly like Mel Gibson, along with the Lethal Weapon series. He’s a violence-loving conservative bastard. lol  Moving along ::cough:: ENGLISH SUCKS!!! Well, maybe not so bad, but this project sure seems daunting. I mean, nearly 300 points in about 1 month, tons of work, and the topic isn’t necessarily interesting. Even yet, I managed to write over 200 words on “what it means to be a Murphy” today…lol. Then there’s that social project, which shouldn’t be so bad since we have tons of class time. Over all, the class I dislike most right now is English. Have fun with vectors in pre-calc  The biking season’s closer than I thought-I already have an indoor training session this Saturday. DAMN this snowstorm! It can’t be spring with 7 damned inches of wet, heavy, sloppy snow on the ground, with me shoveling it all away. No, I don’t have a snowblower. Not that we really need them a whole lot, thanks to global warming…and when snow comes, people are up in arms about it.  Thank you, Mr. Bush, for your immense efforts on industry emissions control. You have really helped fuck up our air, and you still deny the existence of global warming. In fact, you try to cover up and eliminate all of the scientific FACTS that point towards global warming. I want to thank you again, Mr. President, on your efforts to weaken the United States Economy and drop the whole damned country into 500 billion dollar budget deficit. And also, thank you for cutting the taxes of fat, rich company-owning bastards all over the country and backstabbing middle and lower-class citizens. It’s really helped eliminate the huge poverty gap. Despite all these wonderful tax cuts, you took the country into Iraq for no real need, except for all that oil that a Texas oilman like you can’t resist. And now the country is stuck between Iraq and a hard place. Thank you, again, for stealing the 2000 election and screwing over the United States of America.  A good book to read: Red, White, and Liberal, by Alan Colmes. He happens to be the host of a news show on Fox news network, which is by coincidence, the most utterly idiotic and disgustingly conservative TV network.
