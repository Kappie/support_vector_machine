Most likely you won't. But you never know. So, I'm bored at the moment. But tonight I have Bible study to look forward to. But in between now and study, there will be a "values clarification" class. The liberalism of the people here knows no bounds. I was told last time, "We will discuss things here that you won't get a chance to anywhere else. You may feel uncomfortable at times." Fun fun fun. I'm really looking forward to that. I just have to remember I'm earning at least a $20K scholarship by being here. Which comes down to 50 bucks an hour if you exclude the time I sleep. So I'm making money right now. Not too bad. Hey, everyone! I'm getting paid to blog! Later, people.
