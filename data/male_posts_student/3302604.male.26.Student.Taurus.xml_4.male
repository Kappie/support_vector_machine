On the same day, the University held their annual elections for various offices. Two elections, seemingly at opposite ends on the scale of importance, but what do they have in common? Well, it seems that they are considered equally important by the people in the running for the posts and the amount of canvassing they are doing.  Consider this, in the Local Election, last year, it was clear to me the sort of people who were standig. You'd hear their points in the media and often meet canvassers as you went about your daily business. By the time the election day came about, I had a good idea who I was going yo vote for (an independent if you must know). Now, I have no idea who's even standing, for which party and on which issues. In my opinion, if you don't vote for anybody, then you have no right to complain when the next incumbent of the position doesn't do what you want. The trouble is I might as well not for all the good its going to do. I mean why bother. If anyone had even bothered to come out and say what they were up to, the may gave got an extra vote for nothing, but no. The same is true for the University elections. Occasionally, you'll see a poster up telling you to vote for someone or other in some position because ' I'll make everything better '. But you never see these people once they have taken up their position (or even find out who won).  Another point on the importance attatached to the Eurpoean elections by the returning officer. In the General or Local elections the ward that we belong to is once of about twenty in the Edinburgh area. For the local election, guess what the ward we belong to is....  Scotland . I kid you not.  Vote for me. I'll not do anything either.  Jack
