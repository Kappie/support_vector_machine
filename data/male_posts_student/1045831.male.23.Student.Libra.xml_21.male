We then went ona tour of the Old Man bars in lawrence...  went to Stu's for a while..  then we went to the Shenago Lounge where to our surprise all the drinks were free...  April came and hung out with us then we went back to her house and drank some more..  then home to pass out in a lump of drunkeness..  It was a good night..
