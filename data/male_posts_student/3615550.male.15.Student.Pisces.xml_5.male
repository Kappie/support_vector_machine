Maybe the U.N. will condemn stuff.  They're good at that; it makes them feel like they are doing something good without that annoying obligation to take action.    Maybe they'll blame it on America; after all, we are the ones who invaded Afghanistan, and by freeing the people, we have given them more means to make the drug.  DOWN WITH AMERICA!  Really though, this is a big problem.  U.N. bashing aside, somebody really needs to take some action in Afghanistan, whether that someone is the U.S., the U.N., or somebody else.  Maybe they'll be able to work something out.  Finally, let's not forget what the article said about illegal drugs versus legal ones.  Abuse of any substance, legal or illegal, always leads to bad consequences, sometimes for the individual (such as lung cancer) and sometimes for society (such as a drunk-driving accident).    Let's be more careful with God's temple; let's present ourselves a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God.  Once everyone starts doing that, alcoholics will want to change because they will no longer be the norm and socially acceptable.  That's the only way to guard against substance abuse.  Be blessed!
