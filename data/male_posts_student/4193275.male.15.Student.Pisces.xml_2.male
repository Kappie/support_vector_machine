Today I "practiced" "singing" (yep, they're both in inverted commas because it probably wasn't real practicing and it definitely wasn't real singing) with the aid of a really sad book, which you too can purchase at  urlLink http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/184442880X/qid=1092866238/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i3_xgl/202-1114015-6414214  ! Despite the optimistic title, I really can't sing, but "singing" along to the CD is pretty fun. I also got another book, but the CD for that one features a strange robot woman instead of the lovely David and Carrie, so I don't like that one. My favourite exercise is number 12. You have to sing:  You're wonderful, you're beautiful X 4  but the "you're wonderful" has to be really loud and the "you're beautiful" has to be really quiet, but they still have to sound the same, so you can't just shout and whisper.  God, I'm sorry, I just realised how incredibly boring and sad that last bit was. Who the fuck cares what my favourite singing exercise is?  Daniel  P.S. I also like the one where you practice riffing.
