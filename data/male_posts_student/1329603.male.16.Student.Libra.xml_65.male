I know anyway, it's very upsetting to be reminded at all, much worse when you laugh at me because of it. I'm really quite upset about it, seriously. I know you didn't mean to upset (or if you did I'd be fairly shocked), and you're really nice and friendly, but please be a bit more sensitive about... well, anything to do with Sam. I'm sorry, I don't mean to be angry, but...  OK, you may have guessed but Miller's not on the top of my "list" at the moment. Je crois that it's Rachel Foxhill at the moment, partly because she seems to like me in that annoyingly not-fancying way but in the way that she's still a little shy around me but tries to talk to me ^^. She's cool.  I started writing a song today, for the band. Woo!  Oh, and also, I may become the singer in a metal band at school with Buzz... Heaven knows, and I don't.  Mum has been am-az-in-gly cool and granted me permission to use some of the money she put into my account, as savings, to buy a white fedora... how cool! I found one in Cribbs Causeway Topman, and I think there's a Topman in Cheltenham... *drools over hat* As Miller said, it's only a hat, but it's SUCH A COOL HAT. Scott's getting a Trillby, so I'm going to get the fedora. Seems only fair.  I am narked off.  I got my debit card through today, whoopee!  If 2 + 2 = 4, does 22 + 22 = 44? Short answer: Yes. Long answer: ...No, not at all, dumbass(!). I mean, what kind of idiot are you? Did you come up with the Gloucester schools review or something? Duh.
