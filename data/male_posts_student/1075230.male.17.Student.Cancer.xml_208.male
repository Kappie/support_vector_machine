Extracurriculars may be different. I'm sure doing better in units than last year. Etc.    Some people would kill for such normalcy... those in countries with natural or man-made disasters... or even close to home, when income isn't always a sure thing. However, once you've conquered all those big problems, what next? Help others. There's always suffering and stuff in the world... and help is most appreciated.    Wouldn't it be funny... if people got what they hoped for, and everyone is well-fed, sheltered, stable job, and good health? Big problems ... all gone. I could just imagine... people looking around with a bewildered look..."what next?"    Then again, there's always room for civilization to grow... outer space to explore, new remedies to discover... however, civilizing the earth so far does not seem to benefit it much. Sure... we live longer now... but do we do more with our lives? Sure... we have all these conveniences and materials... but at what environmental cost? How long can we eat up the earth's materials, before it finally breaks down like a too-oft ridden horse?   I'm not saying progress is a bad thing... it's just that there's always balance.. no matter how much you advance, something else would deteriorate in its place. Which kinda contradicates my first point of how pointless it would be if the world was perfect, since if there's balance, it'll never be perfect.    Well, that closes off my random thoughts...    ~Chronos
