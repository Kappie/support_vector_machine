Now im hyper and having a lot of toubles typing. hehe. Well anyway im greatfull that my other friend hasn't imed me cause i dont feel like dealing with her. She is even more depressed then me. And she is upsessed with keith urban and elivis. She said one day she will marry keith urban. I was like ya right. Shes only 15.....I don't think it would ever work out.:P
