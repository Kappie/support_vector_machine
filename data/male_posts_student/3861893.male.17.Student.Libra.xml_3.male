We were dragged down to some "interesting" econs tutorial which wasn't even supposed to be there in the first place. At the wrong hour of the day, the econs tutorial is surely a cure for insomnia. Definitely. I just wonder why the doctors don't recommend that to their patients.They will surely make more money. Anyway, before that tutorial, wemade a pact that we wouldn't yieldto temptation. Haha. So funny. Anyway, was glad that I didn't fall asleep like that Wesley who almost fell off his chair. Now, you must be thinking that if I didn't fall asleep, then I must be listening to the teacher attentively right? Wrong! I was notsleeping but was engaged in more entertaining activities. Almost throughout the entire session, I was talking with Alvina and Su Peng that nothing went in. The only partof mybodythat was productive was probably my right hand. I had to copy those long essay outlines. Haha. Somuch for productivity.   After that, I stoppedat the bus stop at Queensway waiting for my bus. Guess who I saw? Soo Chin! Haha. Didn't really expect to see her at the bus stop. Almost didn't recognise her. In fact, she recognised me first. Haha. Then later saw her again when I was on the bus along Bukit Merah Safra. Haha.Was so funny. Anyway, knew her all the way back since those Sec One days. Haha.Couldn't remember how Ireally got to know her. Those days were donkey years ago. Haha. But one thing I rememberwas that she keeps playing this stupid game with me. Don't know how to describe the game lar. Yup, then went on to know her better during Sec Three and Four days even though wasn't in the same class as her. Ya, she's a nice person. Easy to get along. Haha.   Just received an email from Ying Yu about Mr Chia's wedding. Haha. Finally going to get married. Knew his guy all the way back in 1C'99. Was my form teacher. Have always been a slack teacher. Became Discipline Master but was still very slack. Haha. This guy implemented those discipline forms for people who don't do homework and yet during his classes, he never used those silly forms. Slacker! Haha. Glad to know that he is doing well and is going to get married. I wonder if this is the lady whom he courted for seven years or something. Haha. So devoted.   Think that's about all I will write today. Coz I'm rushing to watch my favourite show, the OC. Cool show. Yup. Got to go...
