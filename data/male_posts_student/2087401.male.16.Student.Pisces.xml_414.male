Michael J. Fox guest starred as a doctor with obssessive compulsive disorder, who was unable to use any toilet but the one in his own house, however he conquered this fear and used the roof toilet. The message: We all need to poop on the roof.  That was completely random and probably won't make sense unless you either watched the show, or saw this particular episode.  I added this so Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.
