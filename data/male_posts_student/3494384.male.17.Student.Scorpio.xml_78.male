I've post this song before. But this song is playing and playing in my Winamp. I'm so shit.  This song reflect what I'm feeling now. Shit shit shit.  I'm so stupid. I should have forgotten about my ex. Why call me? My mood keep flatuating today and yesterday. Oh shit.   So what if you're much more good looking? So what if you got a new boyfriend? I dont wanna know.   Treat me like you dont know me. Dont ask me to message you anymore. This is all over.  But deep down inside. I'm not feeling this way. I dont wanna end all these. I cant forget. I cant do ANYTHING.   Tears are dried. Feelings are gone. But why cant I forget you? Why? just when I'm about to forget you, you called.   Shit everything. I'm going to sleep. I need to sleep. My world is fuck up.   I thought we can remain friends but I dont want it this way.   I sucks. I should have delete you from my Friendster. The pictures keep revolving around my mind.   Why why why.   I'm in a fucking daze now.   Where is all my friends? I have my friends. I dont need you.   Oh fuck. What's with me? I'm going to bed.
