So all the guys were like, "Whoa she's got hot legs(she had really short shorts)" And as always I wasn't able to make all the laps around the track.  The hot Sargeant was pulling me and I stilll couldn't make it, and when it was almost over the two other chicks  were pulling me(enjoyed it, but embarassing)    After the guys dropped me off I decided that I was going to cut off all my "beautiful" hair off.  So when I got home I woke up my sleeping Mom and asked her to cut the hair off(she was surprised *gasp*).  It turned out the machine didn't work so she tried as much as she could with scissors and the next day we went to the hair place.      And on Tuesday I went again which was kinda good because this time I felt almost no soreness  first of all, the dude that gives me a ride saw the hair-do and was all saying, "Slick!"  Anyways went to get Hernandez(very hot  chick)  And when she saw me she said,  "Wow, almost didn't recognize you"     So we proceeded to pick this apparently lazy guy that doesn't like to go to PT(Physical Training)  so I did the training and this time it was different cause we had to run then stop and do the exercises(it sucked ass)  I was stared by tons of people since I was so far behind the other people.  Oh well, so we went to a store "Circle K" and we got a free drink (a whole 44oz of it) .  Then we went to the recruiting office and waited then I got weighed and found out I was now 202 lb. thats around 3lb of lost weight.  Also my recruiter saw me and was amazed and chuckling at my new hair-do.      Finally I left with the rest of the guys and got home and ate food and got some *hush*   free porn on the internet via "backdoors"    I then slept at around 8:00 am until 5:00 pm the next day(today)        Okay that's pretty much what happened those others days.  And today all I did was sleep all day and eat.
