Manmohan Singh, an economist to the core is at the top of the Food Chain of Indian politics. That too after a rather dramatic turn of events which shows that we Indians can never fail to amaze the world.  Take a look at the news channels. These two words rattle endlessly out of those talking heads 24 x 7. As if our lives depended on these. I wish it did so that we could expect some welcome changes in the quality of life here in India. And sometimes I breathe a sigh of relief that our lives are rather insulated from the antics of Indian politics. We are just like people at a variety show or an amusement park--- being taken for a ride and going back home pleased but with considerably lighter pockets. Is this mass unconsciousness that keeps India going --- people happy and politicians happy too ? Maybe...
