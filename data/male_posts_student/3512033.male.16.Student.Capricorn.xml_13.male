(thank god for publicly funded education)  although the worst is definately over, i still feel as if i must endure eons (is that even a word?) of study before that holy redeeming day of wednesday the 9th of june... will it ever come?  i know i probably shouldnt be posting such pessimistic feelings on here, as i know that it is possible, and highly that my fellow examees may read this, resulting in a contagious depression... but screw 'em... if i have to put up with it, so can they...   mwahaha  by the way, that request of a copy of photoshop is still standiing, as you can see, my site is in dire need of some redesigning...  well, i gess thats it for todays edition, i think i should at least glance over some accounting revision... i could never forgive myself for failing, let alone recieving a mark under 90% in such a simple subject...   saying that, the chances arent entirely equal to zero... there is always the chance that i collapse from exhaustion in the middle of the exam...  man i need sleep...
