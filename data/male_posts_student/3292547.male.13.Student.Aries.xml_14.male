As you can see, msgplus.net is also brand new and will continue to be updated during the week. All the sections have been rethought, new feature pages have been added, new merchandise is available for Messenger Plus! 3... soon, the site will even include localized content for the main pages! a new software, a new web site, both of them still as free as ever: what more could you ask? :)  I hope this fourth year will be as great as the past three ones. I promise you that I'll continue to do everything in my power to improve your Messenger experience. Thank you all for your wonderful support!   Wahoo! I've had it since this morning about 5 hours after it came out. I must tell you there's a BIG difference in the appearance of Messenger Plus! now. In the Plus! installation package,  Patchou  included software from his sponsor that installs itself together with Plus! Select  I refuse, do not install the sponsor program  if you don't want anything else but Messenger Plus! on your PC.    The new Messenger Plus can be directly downloaded from  urlLink here , or from the  urlLink downloads  page.    urlLink      Improve your Messenger experience for free at www.msgplus.net
