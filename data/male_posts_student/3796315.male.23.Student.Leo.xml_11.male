That's a memorable thing, could have been much more memorable ya, heehee. Goal for the new 'year'? Study well, be a better person, etc, etc. Wish? Hmm...guys, what do you think, haha... Anyway, chatted with friends back in SCE. And man was I surprised at the latest news. KG and BQ both have girlfriend now!!..!! It's unbelievable... That's so fast.. unlike some of   us  ..haha, know who I mean..  Last night we had baked mushroom and chicken  filo  made by michelle. And after that, WX made chicken curry for the pratas we bought... that was so tasty. Michelle also had her first attempt in making 9-layer kueh last night. Haven't tasted it yet, am sure it will be nice. So last night, our neighbours Dominic and Jinghui came over for prata supper. I had cheese prata with milo Dinosaur.   Today will be my cooking day, haha. Will do my best to cook a nice meal. Anyway I got to go. Have to do some reading up and tutorial before I go grocery shopping for the dinner because tomorrow is Wed which is the start of the busy week for me.
