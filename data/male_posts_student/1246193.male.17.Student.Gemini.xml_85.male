I recieved a rather loud wake up call today, actually it was more like being woken up by a 1,000 piece trumpet ensemble. We are old.   I took my first steps into the rest of my life today. The college applications have begun. I am going to apply Early-admission at University of Chicago but not at Wash U. I am not applying early at Washington because they are binding; you get accepted and you are attending. I am a little confused about how it can be legally binding but I suppose that since I don't have a law degreeI don't know much aboutthe law. I don't know where I want to go, or how on God's green earth I am going to pay for it...I'll worry about it later. I'm scared,and I still have a year left in Taylorville. I am going to visit SLU in a few weeks and we shall see how that goes. I suppose that I shouldn't beso worried, but I am comfortable here with my friends and the town that I know...I don't want to come out from under my security blanket.I know that there isgoing to come a time when I must throw caution to the wind and let life take me away, butI am not ready yet, I don'tthink I will ever be.   "The secretof health for both mind and body isnot to mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly."--Buddha
