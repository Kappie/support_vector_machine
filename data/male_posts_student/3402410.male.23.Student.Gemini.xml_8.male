I'm so hip: Friday night, alone at home surfing the web while thinking,  Go to bed you cad! Sleep, sleep! You're tired!  Yet I continue to surf.  Been taking quizzes at OkCupid -- a site made by the same two guys who created The Spark. I took the personality test and apparently I'm The Loverboy. Check it out:   "Well-liked. Well-established. You are The Loverboy. Loverboys thrive in committed, steady relationships--as opposed to, say, Playboys, who want sex without too much attachment.  You've had many relationships and nearly all of them have been successful. You're a nice guy, you know the ropes, and even if you can be a little hasty with decisions, most girls think of you as a total catch. Your hastiness comes off as spontaneity most of the time anyhow, making you especially popular in your circle of friends, too.  You know not to make the typical Loverboy mistake of choosing someone who appreciates your good humor and popularity, but who offers nothing in return. You belong with someone outgoing, independent, and creative. Otherwise, you'll get bored. And then instead of surprising her with flowers or a practical joke, you'll surprise her by leaving."  A flattering assesment of myself I think.  urlLink Take the quiz yourself if ya like . Some other quizzes I took:  urlLink The Virgin Game  (you have to look at pics of folks and guess if they're virgins or not), the  urlLink Geek Culture Test  (I'm "mildy geeky"), and the  urlLink Kinkyness Test  (I'm "pretty kinky"). My username is TheRedWave if you wanna spy my results.
