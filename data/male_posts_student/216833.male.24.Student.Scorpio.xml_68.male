Ugly slut. Then I go to my car to leave for the day and she is sitting in her car next to mine on the far end of the parking lot. I open my door and she says, "Oh! You scared me..."  I just smiled and closed my car door. See ya later, wierdo.  Got the fucking 7" compilation in yesterday. Also, the deposit check from our vaction. I'm fucking glad the wax is here. Now I gotta wait on the covers and this mess will be done - one fucking year later.   My legs are still pretty sore from the leg workout wednesday. Today is bi's and tri's.   I decided that I am not going camping after all. I need to finish up some things and I want to work on some shit around the house. mimi is going to snyder this afternoon for her cousin's graduation. Hope that goes well and she stays safe. She should be back around 2am. I think I am going to toy around with my vepsa - I got some skrilla so I 'm gonna clean up the parts and see If I can make some headway and get it up and running soon. Also, I need to dick around with the Mortal Kombat arcade. Maybe I should order the parts today. I will do that. Also, F.Y.I. - the Time Killers arcade game is up for sale. What's a good price?  I also need to clean up the house and finish folding the clothes. I need some beer buddies to drink some beer form my beer mugs. haha.   Sometimes I miss palmer - maybe I had a non-sexual crush on the guy - i dunno. But him leaving has really left an empty spot in my life. I feel like a dork but oh well. I guess I will have to shoot up to Denver and see him. I called him around Tuesday and Aurda answered the phone. I talked to her for a little while - I wasn't mean, I guess I'm not pissed about it anymore.
