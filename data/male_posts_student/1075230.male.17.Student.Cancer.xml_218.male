The was a gentle rapping at the door, and Hinotama went to answer it, not before recieving a cold stare from Haruka.   One of the daughters of the house, who was about only 12 years of age, held in her hand a candle and a kimono in the other.    "Here you are...sir," she said with a mumble and bowed her head with a blush.  Hinotama smiled gently and pat the child head. "Thank you. Now off with you; to bed," she said with a wink.   As the door closed, Haruka asked, "What's all this about?" She could here the sound of Hinotama shuffling around, but making hardly any noise.  "No time Haru-chan," she responded lightly, "just stay there and be quiet."   Haruka looked away and edged into a corner.  "Ah," Hinotama said, "here are the necissities to hold my hair up. "Hashi!"  Haruka almost flinched,  eating utenils...?  she thought in puzzlement.   The men ignored the inn keepers and barged up the stairs of the small house. Being ordered by their master to dispose of any suspicious characters, they were more then happy to rid themselves of these annoying pests. The one who wore their hair short was a freak look alike, a walking disgrace, and not to mention the other who pranced around the village as if he were in charge.   Saro, a large man and the one in charge of the small gang consiting of five members, knocked loudly on the door. There was a cry from the room and the door swung open to reveal a beautiful woman kneeling on the floor. She was whimpering and sobbing and each man looked at one another with a wide grin.   Saro though, knew there was something he needed to know before he had any fun, so he held out a hand in front of his men before they let their ugly nature take over, and asked the woman, "Have you seen two men? They were supposidly loging in this room."  The woman whimpered and answered with a sweet voice, "They left me here, saying that I should be an offering to your lord for forgiveness! The wish to be forgiven, they say!"   The men all moaned, disapointed that their lord should get all the spoils. Each one knew that Saro wouldn't allow for misbehaivour and undamaged goods was  not  what their lord wanted.   Haruka watched as Hinotama was dragged from the room, Saro taking one last look at where she hide; Haruka did not move and was not seen. Light of the Moon shown through the window, reveiling a slight, almost unnoticable grin on Haruka's lips.  "So, this was your plan all along...Hino-chan..." she mummbled; Haruka prepared herself.
