I dont want to accept that i cant get the girl i want...i dont want to accept the thingz that have happened that just utterly destroyed my heart and my feelingz...i dont want to bow down to fate. Even though she still likez him...i cant give up cuz im not that type of person...im not the type of person that just givez up his dreamz, i only give up dreamz if i dont want them anymore...but this dream cant get out of my head. I am a very strong person in the inside...my love for her drives me 2 my fullest...when im in class, when im doin weightz, when im playin vball...i think of her and that makez me strong. I just hate the thingz that r just happenin to me right now...i hate the way thingz r goin...i hate the way my life is goin. I dont know if my decision is for the best or for the bad...im tryin to write my own story...and i want it to have a happy ending...well untill next time...tune in to what happenz to Charlez' dreamz...will it shatter...or will it b great...who knowz...only time will tell...the saga continues
