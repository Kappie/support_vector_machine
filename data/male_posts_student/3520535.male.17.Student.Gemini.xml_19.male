But she said that tomorrow she'd steal me and put me in her class and he said okay. Then, took her home and stayed for about three hours. She attempted to braid my hair and then we played video games on Rebekah's gamecube. Forgot the book which I'd come for, but I'll get it tomorrow. Then, came home and had to take my sister out to eat since no one else is home. And that's about it. Also, I tend to get these instant messages from porn sites trying to get me to buy their services. And they're always a megan, have megan in their name, or be somehow meganish. Fucking megans. Oh well. I'll post more later.
