Decided to go with Aladdin after reading the reviews and asking around, but may end up settling for the Monte Carlo if it comes up unavailable. Now I just have to figure out all the shit I want to do. Gambling..well duh. Also plan on trying out some of the nicer restaurants like Nobu, Spago, and Postrio. Not sure what shows are out but I do plan on catching Cirque du Soleil and maybe some Penn & Teller. Or maybe something with more tits..hehe just kidding of course. Oh and I definitely want to go up the Eiffel Tower and maybe try out an escort or two. Damn this shit's sounding real expensive, real fast. Oh well, this is my bday present right? I'm worth it. muahahaha      Oh and no I'm not serious about the escort thing. Well..maybe if Grace is up for it.
