It's a weapon used to render us useless, inactive, and unconvicted. Is it really a surprise, then, that 90% of Americans surveyed said they believe in God ... but don't live like it? Sure, they believe in God. But they also buy into self-serving materialism and the endless pursuit of "happiness." What is happiness, anyway? Finding happiness isn't about trying a bunch of different lifestyles, it's about dedicating your life to a single goal and gaining satisfaction from getting closer to it. Those who go looking for happiness never find it. The ones who find it don't set out looking for it; they are rewarded with it. If you're seeking pleasure, you're only going to find pain. But if you look beyond yourself and your own comfort, you'll find something that will make you content. Life doesn't become easier, you just get more satisfaction out of it. I won't say God is that thing FOR ME, because Christ is for all of humanity. (As my friend once said passionately in a crowded Mexican church.) I say these things because the way Christ lived is the way we should live. Of course, we can't. We've already failed. But the closer I get and the harder I try, the more satisfying my life becomes. And I'm not the only one. The strongest Christians I know are also the happiest people I know. I believe we're supposed to live like Christ because we're happiest that way. Christianity isn't about following a bunch of regulations. "Don't do this" rules are worthless. It's about genuinely striving FOR God, not AWAY from sin. Does this mean I'm labeling a lot of church-going, Bible-believing Christians as having the entirely wrong focus? You bet I am. But I also recognize that I've been guilty of the same thing for a long time. Staying out of trouble, for the most part, is not enough. And neither is just believing. I really need to work on acting out what I believe. Scratch that - if I don't act out what I say I believe, I must not really believe it. The truth is not something you can just believe. If you really understand it to be truth, you cannot help but act on it. Faith is made complete by action. I'm sick of being inactive.
