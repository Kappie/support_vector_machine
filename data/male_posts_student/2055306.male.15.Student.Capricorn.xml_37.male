(relient k forum) my mom hates that i im her. she didn't really even like that i talk to manda all the time, cuz i've never met her. but you know, biengs she now knows that manda is caleb's best friend, she's kool wit it. bak to christi- she is really nice, and always wants to knowif she can pray for anything for you. the first time i talked to her, whe wanted to know if she could pray for anything for me. bomb.  darin: is he on here ever??? i'm so not remembering right now. oh well, darin is so kool. he is like, the man. he designs stuff and is like, the greatest to talk to about anything. he's never seen a lotr film. i praise him for that. oh yes.  well, i dunno who else to talk about, so i'll throw sum out:  p-mike: i love mike whitford. he's still learning, and is a sincere pastor. if he messes up or trips in his walk, he will apologize and humble himself, and admit he's wrong. bomb.  p-adam: don't know pastor adam really well, but i do know that he is so awesome. one of the most spiritually mature youth pastors ever, so kool.  p-pete: my first pastor i paid real attention to. pastor pete in jr high. wow, he was so nice to me. i love you pete!! hayrides at your place!!!  curt johnson: ok, so non of these are on here, i just have to talk aobut them. curt has the best bass guitar ever. curt is the first person on the face of the planet to tell me to my face how wrong i was about my biological father. he was so right, he's been thru teh crap too. everyone else just puts on their pitty selves when i ever used to talk about my dad. but curt showed me what i didn't think about, what i didn't see. curt is anothre one of those ppl you just hafta like.  jon g.: awesome guitar. so kool, one of the greats. i love jon, and elevator music. he knows the reality of the importance of the holy spirit in his life.  josue: ok, so i'm covering all grounds here. the man on this planet i have most respect for is josue. there is not a person i respect more than josue, he is the man of the mans. in everything, he is just so much an awesome man of god. he hasn't got credit for so much he has done, and will not until he gets it from god. he is the man, and i mean it.  ok, i didn't put up everyone that i could, but you know, it's all good. imeant jst to put up ones of this board but i stretched a bit further.
