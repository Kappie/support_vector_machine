This is due to lack of study during the year, so all culpability shall bear on me. I suppose I have a half chance of getting an E, so I had better do some revision anyway (neglecting politics and lowering me to a B) in order to negate complete failure. With a little bit of luck, I should still be on track for my three A's and my destined course forthwards to Oxford! Well, that's the theory, the resolution itself will probably throw myself onto an entirely different course of life. Probably end up with 2 A's and a B, well at least that could chance me into Exeter or somewhere modestly worthwhile like that. Well I shall depart, have a nice day.
