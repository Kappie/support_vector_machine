Master Chief. Red.   The one I tried to sell on eBay a while back, got $10 for it, and the guy  a) never got around to actually sending me money, and  b) Left me bad feedback on eBay about the whole mess.  I'm quite happy to get rid of it, and I'm also quite happy about getting Gmail.   All in all, I'm quite happy about things. Except now is the time I should be going to work. That, I'm not ecstatic about.
