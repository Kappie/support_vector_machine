This thought stirred some serious thought, we had a half hour before the movie started and I explained," Everyone wants to be captain of their team. This comes following thought that the captains are the best athletes on the team." I explained to him that wasn't the reason I was chosen to be a captain. I did my best to show them that in times of struggle,loss of focus and direction. I could be the one to step up and hold the responsibilities of being a leader(At this point everyone at the table was listening). I told them that when I was a freshman, I could care less about the team. I was in it for nothing relevant, just to do something. My sophomore year. All I was thinking about was myself. Trying to be the best and doing well without caring who I was stepping on or pushing out of the way. I realized what I was doing and decided that the team was going to need a leader in 2005. My Sensei had reminded me that I was a born leader and I should always take advantage when there is part of my life that is without leadership. It was my duty as a true warrior to step forward and expose myself as a potential leader. I could have easily blended in and pretended like I didn't exist. I chose to take leadership where it was needed. Now I have taken the time out of my life to lead this team and gain knowledge along the path. We  WILL  go back to that state final...Even if it kills me....
