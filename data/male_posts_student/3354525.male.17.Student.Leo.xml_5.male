Free health care was what made living in Ontario such a good thing. Outrageous. Cigarettes are up $2.50 a carton. I can't disagree with that. Jack them up as high as you want, people are still going to pay it. The government could make a mint. The provincial debt is going to be paid off in just a few years if things keep going the way they are. I still cannot get over the whole paying for OHIP bit. This is truly a sad day in Ontario history.
