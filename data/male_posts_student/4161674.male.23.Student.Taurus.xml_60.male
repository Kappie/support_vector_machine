So many people I know are pushing for me to move in a particular direction, even though I don't believe that's my destiny. I try to articulate how I'm feeling and my thought processes, but they just give me back spiritual clich√©s and pat answers. I feel so alone. But I draw great strength from this prayer in  urlLink Celtic Daily Prayer: Prayers and Readings From the Northumbria Community :  Lord, help me now to unclutter my life, to organize myself in the direction of simplicity. Lord, teach me to listen to my heart; teach me to welcome change, instead of fearing it. Lord, I give You these stirrings inside me, I give You my discontent, I give You my restlessness, I give You my doubt, I give You my despair, I give You all the longings I hold inside. Help me to listen to these signs of change, of growth; to listen seriously and follow where they lead through the breathtaking empty space of an open door.
