Based on the theory of love, it has broken the rules. Love isn't about looks. It said to be the personalities and characteristics which individual preferences stand the piority. SO why does people doll up themselves? Are they hoping for something more? People tend to improve on the relationships with new friends while neglecting the old ones, some even their cloest kins. Thats why i think human are insensible! the immaturity in them makes them go after the new n better ones rather then improving the current old friends. Have they forgotten when they were at their darkest period, the people who were with them? The golden days that they shared and the most difficult hurdles they had gone through. In fact, they had clean forgotten. Maybe some still remember but unwilling to do anything to revive it. They had never grow up neither they will ever grow up. When will someone learn to treasure the people who love them? When will they give up on the people who don't love them? Everyone says that being love is fortunate than loving someone. But being with someone u don't love is painful. Thats why humans are stubborn. Once stubborn always stubborn. This is a natural cycle. We can never escape from it.
