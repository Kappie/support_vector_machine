Gary did give me my new orders, which, are, heh, fairly confidential.  After that, I went out to Ashley's brother's friend's birthday party at family fun center.  I won a Bruce Lee poster!  Yeah.  And Ash and I spent some time together, which is great.  We went to Fuddruckers, and I have never eaten a larger burger in my life.  Man, I was full.  I had a great time with her, as usual.  I don't know what else to say other than that she makes me so happy, and I make her happy, too!  I later contemplated her birthday gift, and lo and behold, we agreed on a little sum'n sum'n. Sonja and my parents came when I got home from Fuddruckers.  Today, not a whole lot else happened except that I got my ut cds.  BUT UT DOESN'T WANT TO WORK.  I don't wanna have to pay......... ugh......  I am glad that Unreal4Ever is the greatest weapon Mutator for Unreal Tournament 2003, and will hold me over until I can get ut2004.  And then there's Kotor, which I am still playing.  Ashley and her friend Ashley (same middle name, too) talked a while today, and that was pretty fun, too.  Scary, but fun.  Sonja and Ryan left, also.  Yeah short visit.  It was mainly for Sonja to see her friends and then complain about the house.  Swear to God, she always whines about the house.    I'm doin' a wash right now.. prolly gonna see Ash to celebrate our 2 weeks *fweeeeeet!*.  Its not much, but it should be fun, again.
