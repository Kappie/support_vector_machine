Yes, i have had some majorly crappy things happen to me in my life.  I'm not going to tell you what exactly was so bad..  Why you ask, because i don't even know any of you (or so i think)..  Yes, i'm usually depressed, etc.  You get the picture...  I go to a little place called Campbellsport High School, it's filled with hicks...  Well, where i live is also filled with hicks.  Yes, i do live in the middle of nowhere...very depressing...  Well, i'm also very interested in computer security..  I'm 15, (birthday january 24) and i am very different.  You know those wrist band things...well, everyone has one, but i found a way to make mine even better.  My first one, i stuck some safety pins in it, so it formed x's all around the wrist band.  Then, my second one, i wear on my hand instead of my wrist.  Just so i'm different. :)  I have a step-dad (saw my dad like twice that i remember, don't know mucha at all about him or my uncle).  He's kind of a dick, but can be nice at times.  I have a step-sister that loves to tell secrets if there true or not..  I have a step-brother, i get along with him, but he's usually off working.  My mom, she was cool, but now, she's very different.  She was warped into my step-dad's mind setting, and now she's not at all fun to hang around with.  I hang out in my room either listening to music or watching some t.v. with the lights off, blinds shut, and curtains shut.  Lol, yes, i love the dark, why is everyone so afraid of it?  I'm going to start back a while before this blog date, just because that's when the stuff really gets "interesting."  Oh, and yes i'm a male, and yes *ladies* i am availabe...lol.  If you want to e-mail me, i'm at the_original_nights_shadow@yahoo.com..  Anyways, off to the next one.. *and for some reason, you can only go from one blog to another without it not finding the page, so just click back and go to the one you want..*         ~You can no longer sleep quietly once you've suddenly opened your eyes~
