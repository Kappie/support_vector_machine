I also got my picture taken for the photo ID, and already I smell the ugly. I'm not very photohygenic on my good days, and this was a summer morning (we're talking about 8:00 AM). Not good. So I'm a health flunkie now. I can't explain why, but I have the strongest sense that I'm not getting enough protein. I want to eat more meat and tofu and maybe some veggie dogs. But these areas are highly limited until the next grocery splurge. I'm taking a multivitamin as well. I have taken a vitamin since they were shaped like the Flintstones.  Speaking of photohygenic states, I chose a new hairstyle. It wasn't cut or conditioned at a barber or any other trained professional. I tried to tame the beast myself. I struck early in the morning, while the head-strapped creature still rested. A quick shower to subdue it and I combed it back into a ponytail. The beast retaliated, trying to break from it's new and uncommon bonds. The fore section succeeded and gained freedom in a matter of minutes, but the back remained in chains as a tiny stub of growth. I fear future revenge against my oppressive dictatorship coup de tat. I can hear the freedomfighters whisper their plans of violence retribution. Ready the tanks.  I'm not sure if I can continue reading Calvin's  Institutes . They're still worth reading, but it just isn't enough to keep my ADD teenage mind captivated. "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Maybe I'll take a quick reading break and read my newest buy: Henry David Thoreau's Collection of Works. We've got  Walden  and a couple of his other works. I'm interested in how his wilderness experience worked out, that I may change mine to gather more spiritual gold from nature's bounty. Also, I may start my DD reading trash:  The Dark Elf Trilogy . You can't suggest this kind of trash to any friends, but it is a good way to relax and waste the mind after a mental binge on the  Institutes .
