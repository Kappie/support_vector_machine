This is because I am young, vibrant, and some might say good looking (ok… no one does). I should be going out, as people who are my age do. I should go to clubs, bars, and what not. Unfortunately, I don’t believe in it. I am more of a home body. I would rather stay home and read, watch a movie, or listen to music. Even if I did go out, all I would do is go out to dinner or watch a movie, and nothing else. I realize that I will never meet other people that way, but it truly is what I prefer. I guess I’m turning into somewhat, of an old fogy, which is something I would never admit to ever again.  Relationships:  Do I really need to make more friends? I would really like to keep my friends to a minimum. In a nutshell, I am quite contented with the few friends that I have. Due to some traumatic past experiences, I feel I have lost the will to “expand my horizons” socially. I feel rather fortunate that I have had a chance to see the true colors of people who were considered friends to me, and to find out that they really weren’t. It hurt very much, but at least, it was a great learning experience. Not everybody gets the chance to go through this filtering process. I did, and I dealt with it accordingly.  No Man is an Island:  I can’t remember the first time I heard this, nor can I count how many times it’s been said. It feels like it got to the point to where the saying became cliché. Despite, its cliché nature, it is true and a lot of people do believe in it (myself included). Unfortunately, so do my parents.  No! I do not have a girlfriend, nor do I have any prospects. Unless, of course, if the term “prospect” in this context means girl whom I like, but do not have the guts to tell her or show her, in which case, I have a few of those. I know that I, one day, will have to find “the one”, I actually, I think I might have found her already. I’m just afraid that she won’t reciprocate. It is very complicated. We’re just in 2 very different points in our lives. Then again, is there any woman out there who is in the same point in her life as I am in mine? I didn’t think so, and I think I am rather wary of that fact.  I am a little old to not have a girlfriend, especially considering that I plan to get married and start a family. So is there pressure to find “the one”? I don’t really think so, although many people would beg to differ. I think that once I have found “the one”, we would naturally hit it off, and it would lead to living happily ever after. I really do feel that way, and it isn’t that I’m afraid of commitment. I’m not like all the other men out there who use this asinine excuse to not get married. It just seems odd that a man can love a woman, but can’t fathom the thought of spending their entire life with her and just her. That really isn’t love. In fact, I don’t know what that is.  This being said, my mother has tried countless times to set me up with any eligible daughters’ of her old friends. All she says to me is,”there’s no pressure, just try to be friends with them”, and just recently, even my father has tried to do the same. It isn’t like I can’t meet anyone by myself. They think I’m pathetic. I’m probably not for that reason, but I think the reason why I am pathetic is because I appreciate them for doing this for me, and I entertain the thoughts of going out with these set-ups. Thanks mom and dad! Will I be happy this way? That’s another issue!
