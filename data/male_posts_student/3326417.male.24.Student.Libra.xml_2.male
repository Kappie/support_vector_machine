The scene was a closed door discussion of the several blood banks in California, arguing if they should test the blood supply with a slightly effective Hepatitis B test. They came to an overwhelming conclusion that the test was too expensive, and the costs did not equal the deaths occurred. Although all this was dramatized for Hollywood effect, I still remember one of the board members saying, "If doctors act like business men, then where do the patients go for doctors."  Although the details are different, I reflect on that scene because it reminds me that although Doctors and Administrators are in the business of helping people, they in fact still are a business. While it would be nice to have an inelastic budget, the reality is that resources are scarce.  The conflict in the first case centers around telling the truth. As a business person my first reaction is to keep things quiet, but as a person who likes to treat others as I would be treated, I find that my sense of moral obligation would require me to tell the patients the truth in the best way possible. I have always felt that honesty is always the best policy. At work I never dance around the truth with my customers. I am brutally honest and my customers appreciate me more knowing that I am being honest with them. Reps at work who dance around the truth (sometimes instructed to by people upstairs) end up leaving canceling their contracts and in some cases seek litigation. Bottom Line: Tell the truth most people appreciate it.
