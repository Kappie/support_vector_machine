It sounds pretty good and is fun to play with, but I need to buy or borrow a real base or midi keyboard so I can get the base line right, because right now, the baseline was clicked out on a software keyboard, and the timing/velocity is terrible and it really brings down the whole track. I'll make it available for download soon.
