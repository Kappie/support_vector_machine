President Bush made a bigger fool of himself by saying "Terrorists keep finding ways to harm and scare our people, and so do we." I swear to God that is an exact quote from Bush. If you watch Jay Leno you've all ready seen this. In the genre of music MTV continued to retard our youth by playing shitty rap music videos by artist like Kevin Lyttle and Akon. On a much better note rap artist Kanye West not only released a respectable song, but one about God entitled  Jesus Walks  finally the youth of America has found a mainstream artist with more morals then a wildebeest. Under the title of movies people still didn't figure out how bad they're being shafted by theaters by being over charged by Coke-a-Cola advertisements and over priced pop corn. A steady flow of shitty movies came out this summer as usual, and lets not forget about the yearly Will Smith saves the world in another shitty sci-fi movie. (See  Independence Day ,  Men in Black ,  and Men in Black 2 ) Last but not least in the overall news subject of news the war in Iraq didn't end, thankfully.  Saddam went on trial along with Kobe Bryant, Martha Stewart, and Michael Jackson.
