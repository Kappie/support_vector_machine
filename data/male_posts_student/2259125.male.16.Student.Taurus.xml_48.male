Isn't there wome way I can save a piece of me?  Isn't there somehow You can take this cup from me?  Lord, I hear You whispering that this is how it has to be.  But, my God, it's awfully hard to say goodbye to me.  Hold me close as I say goodbye to me, Let my heart know that you are all I need,  I'll stay right here on my knees, Until I have the strength to say goodbye to me. 'Cause i'm tired of livin' somehwere in-between My love for you and my love for me. So take whatever's left of me I sacrifice it, Lord to Thee, Goodbye to me!  Help me cast down every idol that I've built Lord, and lay them all where Calvary's blood was spilt, There where You sacrificed Yourself for me, Now it's my turn, Lord, to die for Thee!  Hold me close as I say goodbye to me, Let my heart know that you are all I need,  I'll stay right here on my knees, Until I have the strength to say goodbye to me. 'Cause i'm tired of livin' somehwere in-between My love for you and my love for me. So take whatever's left of me I sacrifice it, Lord to Thee, Goodbye to me!
