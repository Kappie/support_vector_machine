Lol, even though I don't think I spelled it right...I love smelling good.  and not like B.O.  lol.  sorry...kinda random...but we switched seats in Law and the guy next to me doesn't wear any...so he's kinda smelly.  Other than that he might have been kinda cute.  Anyways.  Enough about that.  PRODUCERS THURSDAY!!!!!  SQUEE!
