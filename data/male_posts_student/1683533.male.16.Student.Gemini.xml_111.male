I think I am gonna hate this more than the actual test.  No motivation, i would be pumped if it were the real test, but it will jsut be really really dull tomorrow  Good: See Kate afterwards and then the 9miles2go concert  We got a new drummer Evan Beck, and he seems enthusiastc.  He wanted to practice today but I had work, also, his brother has a pro studio. Sweet.  And Marty says he is really good.  Tank (guy from work) is in a band called The Distance Between Stars, it is a pretty odd name, but here is the  urlLink site  anyways.  "I dont want to be another 'I-dont-care-ican' " -NOFX
