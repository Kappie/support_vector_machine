My pain is nothing compared to this...I don't even feel my physical pain right now, and I assure you there is a lot of pain there. It's the fact that something a lot more important to me was damaged tonight. A man's pride and dignity; my pride and dignity. The true meaning of those words were expressed to me tonight. Right now I can truly say I understand those two powerful words that you can only find personal meaning to.  This may seem frivolous to the one I'm talking about, but it's more then what you think. It's not the fact that I'm o so hurt that I couldn't get the girl I liked, no. That was the least of it. And no it wasn't rejection either, because I was never rejected. I never even made it that far to even be rejected. If you don't know, or haven't even got to that point your life, its more then what your mind is saying is the "obvious". Because in this case, I don't think your mind has even expanded to this field of thought, this new level of subconscious. I may be a "boy", but I do know things, though you may not have even mentally expanded to that level either. Truly being a man is being able to say you tried and strode for what you wanted and what you believed in. I was horribly deprived of that this night. Yah as you may say,"you never had a chance", at least if I tried I could go and say I did try and didn't puss out like a punk. If I like a girl, I will start talking to her, no matter if she even tells me,"fuck off you stupid, ugly shit I'm not interested in you", at least I could say I gathered up my fuckin balls and tried. It's not what  YOU  think is the outcome, its what the outcome is. I never even got a chance to see that. Yes I did like M, and even tiger told me what problems I might run into with her... and you can even ask him, I said I'm going to try anyways. That is truly stepping up, I knew what obstacles I had, yet I still was determined to go on. Even if she would have shut me down and out, at least I could say I tried. That's being a man, facing your situation, though you know the odds may be against you. I only wanted to try, trying and failing isn't what gets to me, it's not being able to try at all. That's what slaughtered my pride and dignity distastefully in front of me as I watched. Rejection isn't a bad thing, but I didn't even get to make it that far. I wasn't even shut down by her, and I don't even think she knows I liked her, not that it matters anymore. That's like getting kicked off the football team, when I wasn't even on the team and never even tried out for it. Look at this situation outside of your little box, think of it from my perspective. Then, and only then, will you truly understand this meaning of a man, and what pride and dignity really is...
