The campout at the lake was great!!! it was me tim clem bryndan and matt, ben showed up for a little while also but he went back to hannas house lol (whipped *whoopish*).  while at the campout at our lake we watched the sunset, the sunrise and had a halarious and fun time in between, i got some great videos and pics that i wish i could post on here.  then the day we came back from the campout, me bryndan and matt headed to b-ham alabama to meet up with our nylc friends.  it took about 4 hours to get there but we finally found katies house.  first we went out to dinnner with a bunch of her friends (guys were outnumbered 3 to 1 hahaha :) including bonnie who was stayin at katies and then we went to the baseball game then starbucks and then to the b-ham outlook, which was freekin amazing and i wish i had a place like that i, i could fall asleep on the hill everynight, i wouldnt even need a house out there.  it was soooo cool.  then while sittin up there 6 of us just talked about deep stuff like life and friends.  i really enjoyed it.  then after that we dropped off one of katies friends and headed back to her house where me matt and bryndan got rdy in our section of the house.  then we stayed till 5 30 in the morn watching blow and all talking and eating and all that.  after 1 hr and 30 min of sleep they woke us up and katie and bonnie headed off to school and we had breakfast and started heading back.  ohh and if you read this katie, thank you again for letting us visit, i know we all enjoyed it and you and your family were all so nice to us while we were there!! and i really try and keep in touch!  when we started heading back, it was weird, i felt like i would see them the next day or something but i realized i wouldnt and i got really sad, the exact same thing happened when i dropped matt off.  i said see you later but that usually means a day of to but it could be 2 or 3 years and i have sooo much fun with that guy.  i just got sad and emotional although i didnt cry lol.  then i came back here and insanly played tennis lol i was dead with only 8 hrs of sleep in 3 days.   ohh and then b/c of my lack of sleep and emotionality (haha dunno if thats a word) i ended up gettin in a fight with jess well it was kinda of fight, they never last over a few hours but i broke my phone when i threw it against the wall and its missing apart not, its kinda funny but not at the time.  i think were all good now though and she is commin back today, i just wish she hadnt told me somethings that she did while she was down there, nothing like hookin up with ppl but still it was frustrating, i just leave out anything that i think will make her mad but she didnt o well we pretty much worked it out and i still cant wait to see her.  ohh yeah i would like to say bryndan is crazy, right after he drove my car back from B-ham, he left to go to kentucky to visit another friend and this was after 1 hr 45 min of sleep for him.  i hope he doesnt crash!! wow that was a long one but well im goin to play tennis with hilton lutz so i will catch u guys later.
