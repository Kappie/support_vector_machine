Sunday i think i did nothing, then at 9:30, i went to Ians, we drove arond then watched philmont video at his house.Yesterday Lindsey and Sara came into work and i left with them, we hung out at sara's and then Lindsey and i got kicked out so we hung out at her house on her couch. Tonight was jeds, then aarons, Lindsey and I played the ankle-slapin game, and when she left we walked around the neiborhood. Mike's been gettin high too much lately so we talked about him, and havin a talk with him. But i talked to him and he said that it was joe and dan pushing to get them drugs, and mike said hes just tryin to be a friend and be nice, but i told him to be strong and say no, and that he's not himself when he's like that, and he agreed, he knows hes better than that. So he told me he's gonna say no to those kinda things, and called me a true friend. Then I talked to heather about her problems, and gave her psalm 23, and she said it never really made sense untill now, and she thanked me.
