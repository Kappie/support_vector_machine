Alrite, so my day started out once again wif waking up early in the morning to take tt stupid Chinese oral thing. By now all of u ppl shld haf already known tt I hate waking up early in the morning. Haha, anyway, the Chinese oral went pretty alrite I suppose, dun think that I'll fail it, but who knows. I can't be bothered anyway, cus wad counts is still the 'O' Lvls, so even if I get straight A1s now, i would not be happy. Even if I get straight A1s now, there's no use cus I might end up not doing well in my 'O' Lvls. So for me rite now it's juz to learn frm all my mistakes even if I failed every single paper. I won't be surprised if I actually do, cus I haven realli been revising for my mid-yr exams, haha, I'm a slacker man!   After the Chinese oral, I headed straight home to take a shower and change. Den i went down to Orchard Road at bout' 1pm to meet a fren of mine. We walked around Paragon and The Herren for an hour first, before heading to Cineleisure for lunch. We met wif two other of my frens and had lunch at Subway, which was realli expensive. It's a fast food restaurant, but their meals are like $6 and above, which is totally unecomical. A meal consist of a sandwich, a packet of chips and a drink. The sandwich was 6 inches long, the packet of chips were those small in size wif the packet onli half full and the drink was normal size. I think the price it's realli too high, they shldn't charge so much seriously. The taste of the sandwich is juz alrite, not all tt superb after all.   After lunch, we went up to the cinema to buy tickets for Shrek 2. We were supposed to watch it at the 3:30pm time slot, but there were onli tickets left for the front row and single seats. My frens didn't wan to seat at the front row or separately, so they bought tickets for the next time slot, which was 5:05pm. So, we basically had one and a half hours to do something else. We walked around Cineleisure first, den we decided to head to The Herren once again (OMG!), haha.   On the way there, i pop into Starbucks and got a Ice Blended Mocha. Boy did tt taste good man! I juz love those Ice Blended Mocha, it's probably my favourite drink too. So when we got to The Herren, we went into HMV to look at some stuffs, which was kindda boring. Not tt I dun like music or anything, but well, today juz wasn't the day for music. Haha, so I went wif one fren to look around at other shops. We went mostly to clothes shops and I saw quite a few things tt I would return to buy during the June Holidays, as I didn't haf enough money to buy them at tt time. Haha, we returned back to Cineleisure at around 4:50pm and entered the cinema to watch tt movie.   Honestly, at first, I didn't like the idea of watching Shrek 2. It juz wasn't the kindda movie I would watch. But hey, I was realli glad I watched it cus it's a damn funny show man. There was one part of the show where I laughed till my leg had a muscle cramp and I was like ouch the next moment. I will definitely recommand this show to any1 man, it's hilarious! I won't mind watching it again too. Haha, the show was one and a half hours, so it ended like 6:35pm.   We went out of Cineleisure and two of my frens decided to go home, as they didn't think there was anything else to do. So it was juz me and this other fren. (the one who I met in the first place) Both of us didn't feel like going home tt early, so we were juz aimlessly walkin around Orchard Road. We walked around shopping malls too and even went into those high class shops, which sold a tie for $170 and a shirt for $930. L0L! Insane stuffs I tell u man. We were done like around 9:30pm and decided to return home at last. Haha, it was a long day for me and I was tired too.   I reached home at around 10:30pm. I took a quick shower and caught the last 15mins of The Bachelor. Den I came here to type the entry for today! Hehe, it was like 11:00pm since I started typing and it's nearly close to an hour cus I was kindda interrupted when I was mid way thru. Let me tell u why...   At 11:18pm sharp as my mobile phone read, I received a call frm who? A fat pussy cat! OMG! As u all noe I'm a polite person who won't reject calls, so I answered the call, thinking tt the stupid fat pussy cat would asked me some decent questions. I regretted answering the call man! OMG! It was like so late in the nite and he juz had to do it. I was in total shock! The first thing I heard when I answered the call was none other than a seducive voice! (obviously tryin to turn me on) I was like OMG!!! But as u all noe, I'm a decent guy and won't realli get turned on juz by a voice, so I politely said hi. When the fat pussy cat on the other end knew tt I wasn't turned on, he used a ger to try to make me get into the mood. Unfortunately, I knew it was a prank and didn't fall for it. So his onli hope was to say wad he realli wan! U won't believe this man, I couldn't either! He wanted to haf phone sex wif me!!! OMG!!! Firstly, I'm not gay! Secondly, I dun get turn on by a fat pussy cat! And finally, it was totally DIGUSTING!!! EWWW!!! It's so late and u wanna do this kindda thing to me??? I'm pretty sure tt I'm gonna haf nitemares later wifout a doubt man. Furthermore, tt gay fat pussy cat refused to hang up till I've said the 3 words to him, which I'm definitely not gonna say wad! Yea, he did finally hang up... like half an hour later? OMG! OMG! OMG! I'm still too shocked rite now! I guess I'll stop here and hopefully get some slp. Hehe, peace out guys! And erm, especially to u bro, peace man! Do not try to do anything to me on Monday, cus I'm merely stating a true case tt happened. Haha, luv ya! (only and I do mean ONLY as a brother! L0L!) Cheers! =]
