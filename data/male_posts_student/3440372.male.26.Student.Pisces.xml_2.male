It could just be a cold, but seeing as how I don't believe I am able to contract colds* then it can't be that. It has to be hayfever, it just has to be. I'm glad I've sorted that out. All logic and reason suggests it must be hayfever and not, as the evil ones will have you believe, a cold.  *it has long been my belief that if you don't believe in particular ailments, then it is not possible for you to contract them. It quite simple really. Don't believe, don't catch. Say with me people:   Don't Believe, Don't Catch!! Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!Don't Believe, Don't Catch!!   Well now that I'm feeling safe and sound (and sane) I think I'm off to bed.  :: follows the little pixies to his bed in the cabbage patch ::
