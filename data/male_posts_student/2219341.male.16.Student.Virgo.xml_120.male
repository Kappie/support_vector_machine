A squeak.  Silence.  Slowly, a small, blonde head peeked out of the slightly opened door.  A look of utter annoyance spread over the sapphire blue face of Daelix Smith.  She opened the door wider, but still continued to stand inside the house.   	 “What do you want, Hubo?”  she asked, not hiding the fact that she clearly did not what him on her doorstep.  “Please, Daelix, cant we just talk like civilized Quivos?”  he pleaded, not wanting to give up.  One of Daelix’s five hands lifted and slapped Hubo’s ugly green face, leaving a purple imprint of a three fingered hand.    “WHY DID I DESERVE THAT?!”  he asked in utter rage.    “Oh, you thought that I wouldn’t find out about you and VIRDE, did ya?  Oh yes, mister, I found out that you two slept together and that your carrying her baby!”  she shouted and the proceeded to slam the door in his face.  Hubo shouted a few choice words at the closed door, and the stormed off down the street.  Daelix, on the other hand, walked calmly into her bedroom, where her own lover was laying.  “You tell him, girlfriend!”  he said, an impish grin on his handsome face.  Daelix sat down on the bed, they kissed, and well, night came.  The sun crept up the ever so slightly opened window.  Daelix and her lover took no notice.  Around midday, Daelix awoke, took a shower, got dressed, and went to the kitchen to make coffee.  A torn piece of paper lay on the counter.  Written in pink ink stated that Daelix’s lover had gone back to his house so his wife wouldn’t be suspicious.  Also written were words of romance that one other than Daelix herself would not want to read.  As Daelix went to sit down on the couch and watch her favorite soap opera, there was a crash through the skylight and glass shattered all around her.  A man dressed in a black cape put a sock in Daelix’s mouth and a mask over her eyes.  Too much was happening at once, therefore causing her to faint.  The sun went down again on planet Bronkitius, but Daelix did not know for she was on a space shuttle headed for the deep depths of space (dun dun dun).  As the confusing cleared from Daelix’s mind, a face appeared in front of her.  “You thought you could hide from me, Daelix Smith.  I think not!  You are now in my grasp and the entire world will obey my every command! Well, once we get to Caladone!”  an evil laugh rose from the creature.     “Who are you, sir?” she asked, afraid for her life.   “Oh of course! I always forget introductions!  My name is Verboosta, the evil villain that you always hear about that always ends up losing with the hero, but no this time! NO NOT THIS TIME! I will prevail!” an exotic gleam rose in one of his fifteen eyes.   Daelix sat in wonder, contemplating on what she should do next.  There was no one to save her now.  She was somewhere unknown to her.  A lively tune played over the intercom, singing “Lost in Outer Space,” and sung by the famous Christoph Clar.  Daelix banged her head against the wall, trying to block out the sound.  The door then sprung open and the most unlikely person came into the room.  It was none other than HUBO!  Daelix’s jaw went down upon seeing her ex.  She noticed the faint colour of a bruise across his face, although he had tried hiding it with some green paint, which he failed miserably at.  Trying to put two and two together, all Daelix could muster was a few incomprehensible words.  “Yes, Daelix, my dear, it is me.  I tried to warn you that Verboosta was after you, but no, you just wouldn’t listen.  I can stay here and rescue you, saving the universe from utter destruction, or perhaps I can just leave you here to be ruled by Verboosta.”  Hubo nodded toward Verboosta.  A look on Verboosta’s face showed no shock.  He stepped out of the corner, with a twinge of laugher on his face.  “Ahh, Hubo! You too, I see.  Finally, I can have the whole family here at last.  Well, except for your mother, God rest her soul.  You have met your sister, Daelix, I presume on that planet you have both been dwelling,  Bronkitius, I believe it was called.”   Disguest spread over Daelix and Hubo’s faces.  They looked at eachother, then at Verboosta, then toward the painting of the glamorous Quivo woman hanging above the fireplace, and then back at eachother.    “Family?  Us?  What? Are you trying to tell me that HE is my brother, and that you…you are my…father?”  Daelix managed to get out of her shaking lips.   “Why yes, of course we are family! Sorry I couldn’t get to you sooner, but you know how it is, blowing up planets here, blowing up planets there.  Hard work being a villain.”  Verboosta said like it was the obvious thing.  He looked once more at his two children, and then left the room.  Daelix and Hubo shivered at the thought of them being siblings.  They had been a little too close that what brother and sister should be.    “I think I’m going to be sick.” Cried Daelix.  She ran into the bathroom and vomited.   “Me too.” Hubo agreed.  He too ran to the other bathroom.  Many minutes passed before they both came out of the bathrooms, feeling a little better than before.  They made there way to the control room where there father was conducting his evil master plan.    “Well, kids, we are planning on resurrecting your dead mother.  It should work now that I have you two!”  he turned back to his controls and continued working.  Daelix and Hubo shrugged their shoulders and went for some coffee.
