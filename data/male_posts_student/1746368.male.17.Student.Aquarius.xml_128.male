I would ask that anybody who is reading this post, please make sure that they have read  urlLink this post  first.  I wanted to compare to you guys my life at the beginning of Junior year and at the end of Junior year.  Beginning: I was very unsure about myself. My best friend had just moved to Oregon and I was feeling horrible about it. I had protected her last year and she really had depended on me for guidance, and now all I could do was let her go with the knowledge that God went with her. Dominique and I were still together and were just about to celebrate our one year anniversary. I was supposed to have my license soon and therefore, the ability to drive to Dominique's house. Little did I know how different it was going to be.  Now: I still miss Jessica all the time. She was a fantastic person and a great friend. Dominique and I are still going out after some hard times and while it seems we might be going to those again, I still like her so much and hope that this is who God has for me. I am not unsure about myself anymore. God is with me, I know it. I was struggling with my sins at the beginning and I am now on the road to victory.   I see how much I have grown after reading all of those, not only in my spirtiual walk, but in my mental abilities. My writing has improved greatly, and my sentences don't look so choppy. I hope to keep thie blog for many more years and I have decided that eventually I am going to upgade this to blogger pro. I love writing and this is one way I can really write what I feel. I hope that all of my readers stay with me as I move around and that I can stay with all my readers as they move around. I want all of them to know that I love them all and that anybody who reads these posts know more about me then my parents do.   Sometimes I wish I could be out of here and sometimes I dread that time. Anyways, post a comment.  "Dark Helmet: Before you die there is something you should know about us, Lone Star.  Lone Starr: What?  Dark Helmet: I am your father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roommate.  Lone Starr: What's that make us?  Dark Helmet: Absolutely nothing! Which is what you are about to become." --Spaceballs
