I've been pondering this for a long time, and somehow i get the feeing that i've not found him anywhere in my life at all. Looking back, i find my life is corrupted with sin, and the evils of sin still tempt me today, making it so difficult to love the people around me. Sucess, wealth, grades.... they have their value, on Earth, but not in heaven. To the rich man who asked "What must i do to inherit eternal life", Jesus replied, "Give away all your richesand come follow me". Indeed,i acknowledge that nothingbound on Earth can be taken to heaven. But then, i also realise that i've not done anything in my life out of the love Jesus has given to us.  I want to follow Jesus, but i just don't know how. I've stopped praying regularly and have even stopped being attentive at mass. Whats happening to me?   I'm like the lost sheep. Without my shepard, i fall prey easily to the snare of the fowler. My only hope now is that my shepard comes looking for me, and finds me. I want to return to prayer, to be in communion with Christ. And i know that so long as i repent, and follow my shepard home,Hestill has a place for me.  "He who has never loved, has never known God."
