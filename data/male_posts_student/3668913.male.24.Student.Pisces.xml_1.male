Statistics also showed that the group between age 20-25 were the most vulnerable to divorces. Upon reading all these, I kind of feel quite sad that our so called modern Singaporean society has now set this new "record" Although we are progressing in our economy and technology, morally we are regressing. But beyond the regressing part, it is quite sad to read and hear that people no longer cherish the vows they had made, that "till death do us part". While certainly, in every divorce cases, every couple have their own reasons for splitting, that does not give any excuse to people for splitting.
