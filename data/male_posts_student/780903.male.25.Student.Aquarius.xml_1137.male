The trainer kept saying stuff like "there was big demand for that feature, Westlaw doesn't have it, only Lexis does."  Yeah, it's like drop-down menus, or automatic pdf conversion, or something so marginal.  Don't get me wrong -- I actually prefer Lexis to Westlaw (Note to any Lexis reps reading: Can I get points for publishing that?  Note to any Westlaw reps reading: I'm just kidding).  I like Lexis better because it has more magazines, and reading Variety and the New York Times archives, and Newsweek, and Entertainment Weekly, and Sports Illustrated for free -- well, knowing I can, not that I actually do -- is pretty cool.
