They don't understand.      Perfect example: the song  Parachute .  This is, I swear, one of the most beautiful songs ever.  You might be lost in the same A-G-G-D chord progression.  You might think the lyrics aren't very clever.  Please, God, just listen to the song.  Please.  I get so emotional listening to it, I want you to feel that.  For anything that's ever put you down or bothered you, listen to this song.  Get it's message: it's beautiful.  I've cried listening to this song.  The end is the greatest thing of all-time.  The redemption is great, when not only Ryan Miller, Adam Gardner, and Brian Rosenworcel realize that there's always someone there looking out for them, but   when  you  realize that you're not alone, there'll always be someone there for you.  In my case, it is my girlfriend Jami.  I realized this last night when even my parents turned against me, and I was left alone.  She came and picked me up, and for her I am forever grateful.  I don't deserve her, but I swear that I'll love her as best as I can for the rest of my life, with everything within me.        Here are the lyrics to  Parachute :      There we stand    About to fly   Peeking down over land   Parachute behind   What was that moment for   Which we live   Without a parachute   About to die      Find my self convincing   Blindly falling faster   How easy   Know the place I'm leaving   And the rest is just gone      Oh the adoration   But how much strength does it take   For exploration   For split decision   Are you stronger to remain      Find my self convincing   Blindly falling faster   How easy   Know the place I'm leaving   And the rest is just gone      It crept up on me   Ignored all my pleas   Begging to leave   No justice to maim me   Fell out of the sky   Cease it to be   Without a reply   Gravity fails me   When I awoke   I knew what was real   Hope to convince you   Lies they all torture me   Opened the door   Knew what was me   I finally realized   Parachute over me      I'm in tears and I love you.  I love this song, I love this blog.  I've got to go, though.  Goodbye.
