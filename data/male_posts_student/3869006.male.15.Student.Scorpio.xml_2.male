Ashleigh picked out some shirts for me, a crazy Garfeild shirt, a blue BUM equiptment shirt, and a (hot)black shirt. Then I got to watch as Ashleigh, and all picked out night ware, under ware, and the such. Ashleigh found these kickin shoes on sale for just $5.00! Then I got to guard the clothes while Kayla and Cath tried them on 6 at a time. All together I had a great day, on the way to Ashleigh's the rad almost overheated, and then after casing a house for it's water we went home, and I got to model my 3 new shirts, Ashleigh says I look hot in the black one ;). Tomorrow I get to go to another wallmart with Ashleigh and Kayla and Cath to pick out some casual dress pants to go with the shirt they got me! Hooray! Well, I'm going to go to bed now. Lovingly Loving Ashleigh ~Sean
