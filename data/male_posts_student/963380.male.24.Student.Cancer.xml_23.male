Their deft manipulations of english and it's rhythmic intricacies is impressive to say the least.  My other impression is that it fucking sucks.  So it is with trepidation that I am going to see "8 Mile" this evening - the story of Marshall Mathers III (does he go by three or the third?) and all the angst he had to put up with as a kid. I'm sure there are a few children on this planet who can say they honestly had it easy as fucking pie as a child, I was not one of them. I never have, nor will I ever (in my foreseeable future) live/lived a tough life; conversely I'm not getting a movie deal to commemorate the worst memories of my youth either. So I'm expecting to see some seriously depressing shit to validate the fact that I'm witnessing a multimillion dollar sploogebath in the honour of this chaps' life. That said I've got nothing against the fellow - just that I'm not so sure he had it that tough. I guess I'll find out tonight.  In relation to rap - I hate a lot of people, however, my hating skills really do have next to nothing compared to the hate generating power of rap. It's fascinating to see jovial happy youths transformed into do rag wearing, gang colour sporting, rhyme spitting angry bastards of death. It happens to only a few, and yet it happens. I can't help but think that if they didn't listen to this shit and take it so seriously, they would have grown up to be nicer people. Nobody likes a fucking "mad dog killer" attitude, put it away homie.   On the upside I've got dolphins on my radio in my car. Yeah, I forked out some extra juice to get the Organic Electro Luminescent  Display. What does that do for me? Starts me down a long path of ricin' it up.
