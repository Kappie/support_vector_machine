As the bell rings i immediatley know what direction i am headed, there is no migling around after class, there is no friendly conversation, im out like a trout. Today is Thursday, and Thursdays are known for their awsomeness. They just have the reputation of being the best day of the week, and to this day it holds that reputation. The main reason is that the Salinas and Monterey people unite... but it has become even more than that. So back to the story...  I leave chemistry, i take a quick left, Jason Naylor is still in the class... now when i leave a class without Jason, you know something big is in store for what im headed to, because i always wait for Jason. so i walk quickly down the hall, Oliver Twist jumps out in front of me, and i pummel him into the thick floor tiles without even slowing me down. I head down the winding stairs, to "the meeting place," which is where everyone always meets between classes and after school, which is also mike and I's locker.  Now this is where the adventure starts, from this moment on is what made this day one of those days that are just better than all the others.  There he is, right where he is supposed to be... Tyler. I quickly put away my books, and with little hesitation we split outta there. OK.... i am going to have to start leaving some of the details out.... at this rate i wont finish the story until the war in iraq ends.  basically we rush to my house, grab the necessary gear, and head to 13th street beach. however, just when we enter 68, tyler realizes that his gas is below empty! fortunatly we made it to toro, in which we saw Gavin. There was laughing and jesting about as we filled the camery, but before you knew it we were outta there.  Ther rest of the trip was "deep thought mode," in which both tyler and I became really depressed, for the bulk of the trip to carmel. but once the CD was changed from Taking Back Sunday to Switchfoot things slowly got better. So we reach the beach. its freezing.  we are the first ones there, ashley mike and christian were supposed to be there too. But it would be a good 45 minutes or so before ashley came, and another hour before anyone else came. but while we were waiting, by chance, David Estrella showed up! so me david and tyler decided to hit the water. With dave on the skim board and me and tyler on our body boards. The water was about -29837 degrees. I thought i was gonna pass out and die. but once my entire body became numb, i couldnt really feel the freezing water.... so it was all good. IT was a blast, me and tyler tore up the waves... it was awsome.  So then come along Christian Monica and Mike. so we do a lil fanning action, summon fire from the skies, etc... and then get back to the fun. before we get in mike tyler christian and i took a little run down the beach, and then, with as little hesitation as possible, ran back toward the ice ocean of death. for me and tyler it wasnt too bad, for we had already experienced the extreme temperature drop (oh, none of us had wet suits by the way). so we messed around did some "gliding" and some baywatch action. and before we knew it we were back on the shore, bloody from the barrage of bullets that had come from the red devil apachie squad that attacked us moments earlier. but we were fine, so we moved on.  we then went to the hyatt to swim and hot tuBBB. it was pretty fun, and it was nice to be in reasonable temperature waters. we didnt get kicked out, which was disappointing, but hey it was still fun.  then we went to pizza my heart, then bible study, yea yea yea fun stuff. (as you can tell i am getting tired of details).  so in a nutshell.... today was a blast. a big blast, Hyroshima blast.  tyler is nagging me to hurry up and post this blog... i apologize for the lack of witty humor, but as tyler also said, this blog's priority isnt to make people laugh, although when i start writing things its almost inevitable... dont get mad when i dont do something funny.  that reminds me... i hate everyone.  Brad Duren - Hair. Lots of it. Brad is like those really expensive chocolates your mom gets for christmas. You have to eat them sparingly, but they are hecka bomb. Brad is a Montereyer, i am a salinaser, so this is why brad is like a rare delight... rare as in i dont see him every day, i still see him a lot lot though. if brad were a turtle, he would be a big black one that had the words "big bear" on the shell written in blood.  current movie thats coming out tomorrow - Troy current Tyler - Smith
