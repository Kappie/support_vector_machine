It's here.  I'm ready. I'm ready to stay up until 2:00 AM every night, and sleep in until 11:00 AM every morning. I'm ready to not care about school. I'm ready to have no stress. I'm ready to beat Shawn and Randy at golf on a weekly basis.  I gotta keep this short, 'cause i'm heading out to celebrate, but I will say this. It's good to be free once again. Now i'll leave it up to Randski to do a proper post.
