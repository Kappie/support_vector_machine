All due respect to you if you're a perpetrator of this trend, but please consider stopping.  I know you're talking with your friends on Instant Messenger or chatting with BigUnit69 and you want to show them that you're friendly and smiling and LOL and ROFL and OMG-I'm-so-carefree-I'm-like-Peter-fucking-Pan!!!!!!!  But I believe the end result of all this horrible misspelling and substitution and bad grammar will be its continuation throughout the lives of its practitioners.  You couldn't imagine an oncologist saying "How r u feeling today"?  There aren't any company chairs saying "LOL Stanley, our stock is rising at 3 times the rate of our rivals, LOL".  Could you imagine an astronaut in space typing a message to Ground Control that read: "Dood we r on the moon.  i dint knoe we culd jump so hi"??  Don't you want to be an astronaut?!  Try capitalization, grammar, spelling and punctuation.  It'll take practice and you may not get it right away (hell, I still don't get it all now), but it will benefit you in the long run.  I'm stepping down from the soapbox now.  Good night.
