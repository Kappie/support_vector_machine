I thought I did terribly but my teacher actually complimented my speech and didn't compliment anyone else which is a good sign.  BUt i still have a Western Civ paper to write but I think that I should be alright with this..  I'm still gonna try and get an extension but hopefully I won't need it...  My manager at work also called and said he had a bunch of shifts for me to pick up which means money which I need.  Seems like things are really falling together...
