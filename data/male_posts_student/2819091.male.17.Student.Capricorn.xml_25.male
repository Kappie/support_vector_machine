Why are you doing this? I cried out my plea... Don't leave me.  Yet, you left without saying goodbye, And didn't even pass me by To tell me that in your heart,  Our memories will soon die. Forgotten and withered away.  I would have done anything To make our memories ring, Yet in your heart, You refused. You wanted to forget, You never wanted us to have met.  Yet we did...  Now I'm all alone.  without you with me, I am drifting in sea of memory. Forever drifting.
