From the side of my eye, I saw a tiny light glittering out of the dark blanket covering the room. Then, from that light grew a strange image that I could not understand. I saw a classmate doing something horrible and bloody. He was killing someone with a dart. And before I closed my eyes to avoid seeing the scene, I still saw him puncturing the helpless man on his right eye. Blood flooded the place leaving me in a shocked state.  Then again, everything became black and the place looked dark. Behind me, I heard a frightening sound but as I looked back, the only thing I saw was a wedding. I was puzzled seeing the couple hand copped as they were sitting in front of the altar. To my surprise, the couple looked straight at me. At that moment, I vividly saw their faces. Blood was falling down their heads and lacerations were all over their bodies. I could not imagine their wedding dresses ruined with blood. Vines were creeping around them as I see them floating away from me.  A television stood from the other side of the room. Zombies were all around the place and they were in a commotion. As I saw it, they were fighting about the television. It seemed that they were familiar to me. It looked as if they were my classmates! But I was not sure. I don’t know…  The place became dark again but another image became clear to me. Again, I saw the killer with a dart. This time, he was devouring on the man he killed. Then from behind, three of my best friends appeared in the scene. Altogether they said, “Come, eat with us. It’s our treat!”  I heard a clock ringing. Then, I remembered that I was late for school and that it was our school’s foundation day! As I stood from my bed, I felt a sudden rush of excitement from within but why?...........
