I think that the person should just like try to keep in touch with their friend in any way possible although the friend in question may be a really good friend that you feel u can tell everything. it like we all have to deal with different things in life and this is another stage that we haveto go through. so yeah another issue is will that person still be your friend when they come back since you haven't seen them all summer? will you and that person be as great of friends as you were before thye left ? or will you like make new friends ? I guess everyone think ahead sometimes but some think farther han others and that can make them great or that can make them paranoid. But if it is something really big like a friend moving for the summer then it is ok to be worried what will happen to you and your friend so yeah if u have any opinions my e-mail address is darckloud_skye29@hotmail.com and beastboy1@sbcglobal.net
