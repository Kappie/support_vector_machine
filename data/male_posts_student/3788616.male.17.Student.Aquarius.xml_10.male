Haha... yup... today is Kelly's birthday, so... HAPPY BIRTHDAY KELLY! May all your wishes come true! heex... so happy! i LOVE her smile lah! i don't know why, but at least, when she smiled, i had this feeling of xing fu... haha... i bet, you guys who read this must be thinking that i am crazy right?! haha... yeah... well... guess, i really am, crazy about her at least! haha... okok... better stop this for now! All i can say is that, i am really serious about her, so please ah, don't like, put me down and anyhow spread empty rumours and scandals... cause, i really wish that things would work out, and , well... i will... wait for her... *blushing*  ok... that's all for that part of my life, not going to say anymore! haha... anyway, my good friend in X just broke up, and damn it, i am damn pissed with the F****** idiot who cheated on her lah! WTH! She is like, wonderful and great as a person and all loh! Not to mention, she isn't bad looking either lah! WTF! Man, i really sympathise with her and i wish that she would get over the guy soon man... it's like... haiz... she is really fantastic as a girl lah, forever encouraging me and helping me when i was down in X... now, to see her this sad and heartbroken, it tears at my heart... Anyway, hey girl, if you ever find out about this blog, just want to tell you... CHEER UP! if you need anything, just find me yeah? will always be a friend to you... :p  Anyway, yeah... am going to be committed and serious about Kelly now... oh well... anyway, today, something happened in school, in class for that matter, and i guess, it's really depressing in class lah... i really hope tat things would take a turn for the best soon! i really don't like this class, i hate to say this since i am afterall the class rep, but i really don't mind turning in my badge and lessen the responsibilties so that i can be more of myself... than, perhaps, people would be able to see me for who i am, instead of who i am supposed to be, someone that sticks to the job, and more or less, more strict and restricted in front of everyone... but... oh well... i guess, what would help is a class party, so... HIRO! CHERYL! NARTZ! Everyone! HELP OUT!!! ;p  haha... ok... that's all for the moment, but... yup... am going to keep upbeat and try to stay on my feet for now! Take care everyone! once again... Kelly... HAPPY BIRTHDAY! ;p heex...
