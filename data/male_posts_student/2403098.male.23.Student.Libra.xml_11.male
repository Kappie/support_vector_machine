It's everything from clever hate mail responses to high profile conspiracys.  For the record:  I do not buy into half the conspiracy stuff, but DID find myself lost within the depths of that website's "Ghost pictures" and "Denver Ineternational Airport" section for a good hour today.  It was not until a car engine started outside my window in the parking lot that I was jolted back into reality.  Scared the f*ck out of me actually because I was in the process of reading about ghosts!  Anyway, check it out, have fun.
