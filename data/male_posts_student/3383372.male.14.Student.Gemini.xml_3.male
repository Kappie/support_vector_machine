Well, today was "fun", my neighbour brought over some kittens that we had to find the mom of, which we did, then my friends came over and we dug up dirt to fill up holes in the front yard. Around 6 we went over to Becca's hous which was really boring, except when becca broke some plastic chairs with one swing, that was cool, also when she chased Josh off her property. The edge is this friday which is really cool. It's this huge party at the Parkway Christian Center, they have tons of inflateable jump things and go-karts, and trampolines, and music, and food, totally awesome! Well, I gotta go to bed, night.
