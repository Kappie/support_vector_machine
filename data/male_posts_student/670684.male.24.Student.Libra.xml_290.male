You would think that a president who wasn't elected by the majority of the people, whose candidacy helped divide the country, would make an effort to reach out to everyone, try to push away partisan politics, and make an effort to befriend and help those outside of his party  she says, pacing her apartment floor, rum and coke in hand.  In the kitchen, two pork chops sizzle in a cast-iron skillet.  My mom is most animated while in the kitchen.    I never thought it, I said.  Why would a man who was a centrist on economic issues, and a staunch conservative on the religious social issues, ever push his platform to the left?  Bush got elected, and he has four years to do whatever he wants.  By aligning himself with the likes of Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and John Ashcroft, as well as social issues like the faith-based initiatives, I don't see how anyone could reasonably expect a rational, understanding presidency from Junior Bush.    My mom grimaces.  She's an idealist, one of those who believes that the United States has always pursued truth and justice, that America is not just a country, but a motto.  She ponders.  Her son walks in her shoes...she was the only liberal in her family.  Now he is the only one...yes, she is still liberal, but times have changed, there are kids to take care of, and the idealism of making the world a better place has to suffer so she can provide for herself and her kids.  A ruined marraige and subsequent debt and poverty took the fight from her long ago.     I was impressed with him once,  she said.   September 11.  He brought the country back together.   I take issue with this anytime someone says it, but rarely do I speak out.  September 11 is the touchiest of touchy situations.  I understand that.  I lost no one in it.  I get the goosebumps, the shortness of breath when I see it on the TV.  But I don't wonder why people would do such a thing, or how they would do it.  I am sad that they did, but it is not shocking.     What did he do, mom?   I ask.    She doesn't know.   He was there for us.   And another president wouldn't have been?  I press the issue.  Many people I know believe that Al Gore would have wet himself and fall into the fetal position at the first sign of terrorist attack.  There is no evidence to prove this.  Just as there is no evidence to say that George Bush did the best job out of anyone in the world...or for that matter, the worst.  George Bush was in a tough situation.  And he did what a President does.  He gave a speech.  A pretty cheesy one too.  Yes, I listened.  I wanted to hear his reaction.  But I didn't need him to talk so I could go on with my life.  I don't think many people did.  Yes, they'll say otherwise.  But that's because they're supposed to.  We all are.  We're Americans.  We're supposed to rally around Old Glory when we're told.  And Bush was telling us.  Yet somehow, I was rallying already.  Within hours of the event, I had downloaded Lee Greenwood's PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN off Kazaa.  I wanted to hear it.  Corny, yes.  Maybe even premeditated by the media...I won't pretend to house original thoughts.  But George Bush didn't tell me to do it.  I didn't need him to.  He made his speech.  Good for him.    And now the media and my mother say he's riding a wave of terror, housing a shoot first and ask questions later foreign policy, making enemies of countries not worth making enemies out of, and just generally fucking the Middle East in the ass.  And it doesn't look like he is ready to stop.  There was an attack against us.  We would like to believe that was the original action, not a reaction to something we did.  So we retaliate with more force.  And then they retaliate back.  So now we bring in even more force.  Because force works.  We can see that, because when we used it before, we fixed Afghanistan.    I want to stop the fighting, sit down with these folks, and see what's wrong.  And I want to fix it.  Bush won't, because he's fellating big business, and big business needs to dominate the Middle East, as this war is about nothing but Globalism...not to the average American, because we live in a bubble, and our society is the Global society, but it's ours too, so we don't realize it...we just take American culture as that, and don't see the corporate influences upon other nations.  There are other nations out there?    Fixing the situation.  You slowly stop the violence.  You sit with the antagonists.  You figure out what they're mad about.  And both of you work at a way to fix it.  They're not all extremists.  The extremists won't get any love if we're not fighting against them...if they're not in a fight, they can't be the underdog.  They're just bullies if the fighting stops.  Terrorists need local support to function.  And the more shit we stir in Afghanistan and Iraq, the more love they'll get from the people of that area.  And my mom will just get more flustered.     He's a boob  she says, as a picture of our 43rd graces the television.  She has no evidence to support this.  She is correct.
