I just got out of the shower to hear that she had infact rescheduled the party. She... I hate her so much. I cringe at the thought that I was once her best friend. It is impossible to fathom the pure evil that exists whithin her soul. I have never felt such hatred toward someone before. I cant type anymore, Im just to angry.
