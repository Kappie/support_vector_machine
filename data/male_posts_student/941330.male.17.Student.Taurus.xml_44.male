"21 questions, 1 answer: richard ho" clever pop culture reference, no? fri, took the scawy ac all the way to the theater, kat was worried we would get jumped so erik reasoned it would be funny to rip his sweater and pretend he got jumped. how believeable would that be if i was there to protect him? you know how imposing i am. oh yea. then we played videogames, amita came wit some styling shades, "who needs raybans when you got those?" says ankur. she didnt kno where to put coins in for the machines, that's ok, she's amita, she's allowed to play dumb to make the rest of us feel smarter :-D elyse was there, it was cool cuz she didnt kno we were watching the same movie...she told the world how she had nobody to make fun of without amita. then watched holes (the 2nd fandango ad is the most annoying pos). it was alright, clever how it was all connected.  track meet yesterday, i was late but jenny and kat saved me from the clutches of the demented security guard. i pr'd wit 13.2 but i still suck. some ppl actually made it to top 8, including jenny which is cool...  sry, that was long. chem cards. grrrr. pat no more have braces? =O
