Just think - these guys are 18 years old (think Ross, Rory, Isaac, etc) and have BMWs, Hummers, multi-million shoe endorsements, and their own contract (a guaranteed 5-year deal with over something like $5 million or more a year!). Many "old-schoolers" don't like the high school players getting drafted (some have utterly failed in the NBA and now don't have a life at all - one guy (Leon Smith) attempted suicide) but many are succesful (Kobe, T-Mac, JO, and KG to name a few) and I think it is a good system - I mean, their job is to play basketball and they do it with the best of them. Oh, and I think the top two picks (Dwight Howard, a high schooler; and Emeka Okafor - a UConn grad w/ a 3.8 GPA) are both Christians. Like anybody that reads this cares.
