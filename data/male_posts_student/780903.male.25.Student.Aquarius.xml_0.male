I've been wandering in the darkness but no more.  No more inadvertently taking the longest path possible to get everywhere.  No more hoping and praying that the next corner would be familiar enough that I'd know where to turn next.  And all for just $4.95.  Plus a 5% rebate at the end of the year (bought it at the Coop).  Started delving into my reading.  Easily distracted by the Mets game, answering e-mails, eating, sleeping, and going to the bathroom.  It's slow going so far, but I have to admit it's kind of comforting to be a student again.  I can deal with reading assignments better than I can deal with 401k plans.
