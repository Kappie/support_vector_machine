She was positive and spoke well of the Democratic nominee.    Ok, now that we got that part done, lets move on to the big speech of the night, Bill Clinton. When he walked out onto the stage, the room seemed to just light up. He was smiling and just great. It is moments like this that I wish we didn't have term limits. His speech was also very supportive of Kerry.   *I will be back tonight to respond to the night's big speeches.
