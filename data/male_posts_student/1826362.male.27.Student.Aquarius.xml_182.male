Last night on the green line, this woman was sitting there with her phone, making it make these awful beeping noises.  continuously.  Until she got off at park street.  and not just beeping sounds, but I think she was trying out ringtones or something.  and the volume was really loud.  And it was super annoying.   And the day before I saw this kid sit down on the red line with a big bag of sunflower seeds.  and he was spitting the seeds all over the floor.  And I was thinking that I should say something to him.  But of course I didn't.  And I was thinking that in the days when men wore hats, somebody would have given this boy a stern talking to, and asked him if his mother had taught him any manners.   I think that a better use of the MBTA's resources would be to have an etiquette officer on the trains, instead of randomly stopping people to ask for identification.  That way, if the whole train can hear your ipod, if you refuse to give your seat to an elderly person, if you are an ass with your cellphone, or if you spit on the floor, the etiquette officer would tell you that you were a big jerk.
