I get ready for the day and suddenly realize that North Carolina is in the Eastern time zone and that I have been going by Central time. This means that I have 20 minutes to meet Molly (my NC State entomology friend) at Mad Hatters. Yeah, I came really close to screwing that up. Molly and I both show up at Hatters at about the same time. We talk about Duke basketball, dating (or my lack thereof), and old Arts Dorm members whom are married, engaged, whatever. After Hatters, we roam 9th street, which has a handful of very interesting shops and eateries. Molly is looking for a wind chime to give as a gift for a bridal shower. The Regulator Bookstore is the next place we visit. While browsing I get stuck in the self-help section while Molly is looking at children’s books. She finds an illustrated book on the life of Henry David Thoreau and the main character has been drawn as a bear. It was real funny. Franchesca’s was our last stop. It has much more space after having taken over the building space next door. Molly recommends to me some mint latte or something; somehow in the years that I’ve known Molly I never knew that we both liked mint. We spend at least an hour in there talking about movies, our respective academic stuff, and whatever else. It’s funny because we talked about so much, I can’t ever remember it later. I mainly just remember catching up and telling stories that made us both laugh. Oh…she and I have the same car. They’re exactly the same. After 3 hours, we go our separate ways again. She drops me off at the WEL and then continues on the road back to Raleigh.  	I then call Stephanie, my old resident coordinator (RA boss). We meet up in her new office, a huge improvement from her office last year. Her hair is now short and curly. Stephanie seems to still be happy with her job so she’ll be staying around for a third year next year. Students who live in selective houses and fraternities have been pretty upset with the Residence Life Office decision to do away with the annual review, but Stephanie’s view is that people are blowing things way out of proportion (some people claim that the university is trying to get rid of frats and selectives). Whatever. I tell Stephanie everything that I’ve heard from Michael Barham and Ashley Colburn, and we end our conversation laughing about the fact that there still is no furniture in the “dead-end alcove” on my hall. Go figure! 	In the EMS office Matt McDaniel and Michelle Hu are getting ready to do scenarios. I couldn’t resist the opportunity to be a patient again so I ended up simulating a chest pain patient first and a hyperventilating mother second. On that last one I actually hyperventilated so much my finger and facial muscles kept consistently contracted for a few minutes afterward. I was real glad about how much Matt and Michelle have progressed over the year. Being a crew chief and doing things like this for my crew members was just about the most fun part of Duke EMS.  	What is it with the Duke food? I come back to campus and quickly realize that I am unable to finish the meals I used to get all the time. The food point system there on campus seems to promote convenient eating, which means I must have eaten more then than I do now. This must be true ‘cause I’ve also had several people tell me that I look like I’ve lost weight.  	Matt catches me on the way to the bathroom and it’s evident that he’s anxious about something. I know through the grapevine that Matt has recently been demoted from crew chief. He’s actually had a pretty tough month and he seems to want some damage control advice; he’ll be assuming the I.C. role in two weeks and he’s beginning to feel a bit overwhelmed. We schedule a time to meet and I hope to help him in any way that I can.  	One of my favorite experiences was going with 7 Duke EMS members to the Durham County EMT-I class. They have the class on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays in the evenings. Fortunately, Kathy Mellown is the instructor. She’s a really good instructor who did one of our EMT-D classes about 2 years ago. The EMTs at the class (Steve Barmach, David Strauss, Jared Miranda, Steev Jones, Shelby Addison, Omaira Pacheco, and Mike Cheung) all had bruises from their previous class when they were practicing IV sticks. Tonight they learned about external jugular IV sticks and pharmacology. It wasn’t a very interactive class, but I pretty much got the idea. I really wish I would have had that kind of opportunity sometime while I was at Duke, but then again I’m in med school and I wouldn’t have had the chance to really use the EMT-I skills that I would have learned. What I thought was very good about the class was that Duke EMS was the most represented agency there and our members were able to network with several other people from different county agencies. I even got to meet with Josh Bordeaux who is an Orange County EMT. Josh (a UNC sophomore), Marcia, and I met probably about 2 years ago to talk about Josh’s goal of establishing a campus EMS squad at UNC. While things haven’t really panned out the way he’d hoped, he is active with Orange County EMS and seems to be happy there.  	Cosmic Cantina is a staple of the Duke student diet. You can get large amounts of food for very very cheap. I actually forgot to bring money with me to the EMT-I class so I figured that I wouldn’t be able to get any food with Dave Strauss and Steve Barmach. However, at Cosmic Cantina I was able to get a good- sized vegetarian taco for $2, which I payed for with spare change that I had in my wallet. You’ve got to love Cosmic. While I wouldn’t call it the “best Mexican food on the planet” like they always claim, it’s got to be one of the best deals on the planet. Oh, and it’s also the place where you’re most likely to get mugged in Durham. Fun stuff! 	David Strauss approached me earlier in the day about doing the incident command structure (ICS) training at Wednesday night’s meeting. How could I resist? This would be the third year in a row that I’ve done the training, and it’s really no burden ‘cause it’s a training that I love to do. I didn’t want the presentation to be “business-as-usual” though, so I needed to find a way to spice it up a bit. Before I went to bed I updated the powerpoints with a number of pictures from past MCI drills and I went about planning an outdoor activity for an MCI walkthrough. I loved having a training task ahead of me, for it gave me a focus and I began to get all wrapped up in it, just like I used to do.
