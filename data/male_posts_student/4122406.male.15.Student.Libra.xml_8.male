The day before yesterday was as lovely weather as you could hope for; bright blue skies, a warm wind etcetc. Now yesterday was a completely different matter - such torrential rain that to stand underneath it was like being pummelled with, uhm, things that pummell you. I was walking back from the library, and as I had no money to phone home, nor a mobile, I had to run through the town wearing my jeans and a t-shirt. By the time I had got home, I was saturated. Absolutely soaking. Today, of course, to stop us English from getting too comfortable with the weather, it has decided to revert to it's sunny state, and is looking very pleasant. No doubt tomorrow it will start snowing, or some such equally silly weather for the beginning of August.   I will be going to see  urlLink 'King Arthur'  tomorrow. Apparently it's not that good, but since I've seen Lord of the Rings, and Troy, I want to see the next sword-y film. More on that when I come back.  Saw  urlLink Minority Report  again yesterday at my girlfriend's house. Slightly unnerving film, as it is set pretty close in the future.
