OK...anyway, today was a typical monday. Woke up in the morning feeling lazy, almost went back to sleep again, but managed to drag myself out of bed. Then went to school and everything happen like it should on a normal monday. Then after recess kena zap by chinese teacher, he seemed to be bloody pissed off, and i would be if i was him. Its not the first time the class was in chaos, ppl screaming and shouting, like girl like that. Ya, then heard news that ming yuan whack a guy from band. My hero sia...haha...then we keep pestering him to tell us more info on how he whack the person. Then after school went confrontation with those ppl, then talk abit crap then go home. Alamak, i still thought got fight, make me so kan cheong, in the end...nothing happened. After that went home, nothing much to do, figured out it was too noisy to study, so took a nap and study at nite. After that went market to eat, then slack here and there. Then tried to study abit of chemistry, and intend to continue on later, then after chemistry do abit of ss. Yep, I'm going to study. thats about it for today.
