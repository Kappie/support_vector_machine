I'm not feeling great about much of anything, but I can go back through this Blog and realize that my life could be a lot harder, and that I have a lot to work with and look forward to. With every thing from friends, to Brothers, my love Patti, and my family, I'm a lot better off than other people. Especially the little things like clean water to drink, the sounds of Metallica, and the taste of chocolate are all worth appreciating.  And this weekend will have a lot of that. I'll be hanging out with friends, Brothers, Patti, and my family. I've still got clean water to drink, the sounds of Metallica, and I know I'll be having chocolate milk at least once with my girlfriend! (cuz she rocks!) There's definitely stuff to be happy about!
