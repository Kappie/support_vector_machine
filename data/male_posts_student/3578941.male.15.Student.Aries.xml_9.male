Oh yah, my uncle is giving me $5 for each present I wrap for him for my aunts birthday, so I am getting $20 today or tomorrow or sometime!  I don't think it's a good idea for me to write everyday because it's going to get very boring, so I am going to write every other day or every 3 days or whenever I feel like it sooooooo I'm outa here.
