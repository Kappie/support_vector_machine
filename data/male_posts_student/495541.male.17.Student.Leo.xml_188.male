After turning in my locker, I ran home and got my car.  I literally went home and got my car and drove back.  That was tight.  I managed to do it all in less than 10 minutes.  I'm quick... like a cat?  Yeah that was tight.  The only downside was that I picked the wrong place to park because the busses blocked me in so I had to wait like 10 minutes.  It wasn't too bad though I got to actually listen to some music in my stereo.  It was doing some weird things while I was driving to school, but it seemed to work itself out because there wasn't anything wrong with it then.  So yeah I came home today and just sat around then went to Best Buy and got the new Staind CD.  I kind of forgot the new Deftones CD is out as well.  Didn't even see that.  I'll have to get that next week.  Tomorrow is 2 finals.  I don't have to go in until 9:45 which is tight.  I'll be able to sleep a lot.  Fun.  That or I'll watch the Price is Right or something in the morning.  :-)  Yep, that's about it.   Listening to: Staind - "Price to Pay"
