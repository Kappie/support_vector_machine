I never really know what to expect on trips or events like these, but I definitely feel challenged, and peaceful, and even a little better about myself and life in general.  The overall package of this retreat was great.  Getting the chance to just personally reflect in nature with God set me up for the rest of the day.  I really enjoyed being able to get away and talk with these people outside our normal environments.  The walk/hike was amazing with some great moments of reflection and contemplation for me.  There were also plenty of opportunities to take great photos.  We had a blast with some of the rock formations and levels to create some interesting scenes.  Now three people are passing the time by playing paper, rock, scissors.  ... I think I'll join them.
