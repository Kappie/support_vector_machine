The director and screenwriter is  urlLink Jeff Arch ,  who was the screenwriter for  urlLink Sleepless in Seattle .  Dave is going to be in it -- I even heard him practicing his line ('guys care deeply...').  He was doing a shoot with a well known South American heartthrob actor whose name is Carlos.  I'm not sure what his last name was, but he was funny.  And apparently, extremely good looking.  I didn't think he was amazing, but the girls there seemed to have a different opinion.  Let me recount an incident:   Carlos and Dave were riding up the street in this contraption -- it was an old, beat up van attached to a really spiffy pickup truck.  They were doing this shoot, and they wanted it to look like they were actually driving.  So they went up a small side-street in Pinecrest.  The contraption takes up the whole road: at one point, an oncoming car with two middle-aged Hispanic women was forced onto the grass.  They drove by, and then, upon seeing who was in the van, they threw their car into reverse and backed up.  "You are even more good looking in real life then in the movies!", they said to Carlos.   After the incident, he said, "I paid them to say that."  You see?  A cool guy.  In the picture above, you can see Dave's head sticking out of the side of the van.  It's circled in red, so you can't miss it.  I got a part in this movie, although I don't think it'll make my acting career.  I think I'm going to be an extra, but the shoot is going to be tomorrow (Thursday) at around 5pm at the Omni.  I'm going to take pictures, so I can prove that I was actually filmed by a camera for an actual movie.  I think I play the guy in the background flipping a coin or drinking from a water fountain or something, but still -- SAG here I come!
