Reports said the woman was aged between 69 and 79.  "They said old," a police spokeswoman said, adding she could not confirm her precise age.  The pilot of flight AA-2133 with 126 passengers on board announced an emergency as a precaution shortly after taking off for Caracas, and fighter jets were scrambled to escort the plane back to Miami international airport.  The plane landed safely.  ::: What is the world coming to when the elderly can't throw a simple fit on an airline any more!?! I mean, what happened to respect for the elderly, huh?!
