If you don't know what I'm talking about check your e-mail for your last minute invitation.  Anyway the match-up today, meaning no disrespect to either of the organizations, is a Basketball game between the Indiana School for the Deaf and the Indiana School for the Blind teams.  Results of last match up: James band cleverly used the hat to convince the toothpick that he was a time traveller on his way to erase the toothpick from history.  The toothpick, racing to stop him, tried to slingshot around the sun and got pulled in and incinerated.  Meanwhile the hair, seeing the vest, gave up on life entirely and exploded.  Bond thus saved the world once again.  I went on the Monon trail today with Marten and Michael (and Sam, who deserves massive props for putting up with us).  It was fun, but now I have to write the story. Ugh. BTW Marten, I still say we put the tagline in italics.   This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.
