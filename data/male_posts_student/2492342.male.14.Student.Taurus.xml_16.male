You promised me your tender caress your kisses at night So try to show it wasn’t in vain coz I’m wasting my time  You promised me Just me and you  Tu Es Foutu Tu tu tu tu   I don’t know what to do with my life But I know my rule is no second chance You promised me You promised me You promised me  Tu Es Foutu Tu tu tu tu tu   You promised me Tu Es Foutu You promised me YOU ARE SCREWED UP...  So..let's go over this again. You promised me. You didn't deliver. Fuck you.          Hm....yes. I think Brighton and DJ broke up. If they did, that's really sad. I hope they didn't. but Brighton has been really sad. Today she smiled at me in math, but ignored em later and was obviously not having a nice day. and gave DJ a dirty look, tho he might not have seen it. I'm too short compared to all 6 feet of him.   Tu es Fouto is a really good song....i dont really have any reason to use it. but thats ok. love to aisha. i need a girlfriend..lol  not that im ever gonna get one..at least til summer. lol... ill meet a whole new bunch of girls and wont look like as much of a dirk. lol...  oh well.   math...first double block..it was funnish in the corner, tho still boring class. at least it was just us reviewing problems without much structure. during free i talked to neena for a long time, about all sorts of things. It was her birthday! she refused to tell me tho because she didnt want me to bring anything. sad....tomorrows yanna's birthday. ill bring her a teddy bear i guess. ill find a barbie for christmas to give to her someday....  i talked to adrienne after school yesterday. i missed talking to her in a while, so it was funny. i sort of made my mom wait like 5-10 mins tho, lol. she kept trying to make sure i saw her.   last night my dad said i was NOT ever wearing a turban. he said it wasnt persian culture. ugh, it has been for the last 25 years, so get over it. then i asked about shalween kameez(a long shirt with baggyish pants, all white) he said thats pakistan. screw pakistan. lol..he told me to wear a suit. or to wear a black turtleneck with a sports jacket like the persian in westwood. thats VERY persian. ugh.  he then proceeded tot ell me about a persian tribal thing. which happened to be a shalween kameez with a belt and fez. weird persians; cant take anything thats arab or mutt- always need to make it their own.  umm....oh, i woke up really late this morning, so id dint have time to shower or do anythign with my hair. people played with it.   i hope brighton isnt still starving gerself  need go  much love   bye
