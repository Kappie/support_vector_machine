I'm leaving in about two hours to Trois-Rivieres (I think there might be an accent somewhere in there) until the 26th. I'm pretty sure there's nothing resembling a computer within half an hour of that place so this will most likely be my last blog until I get back. Stoney's also going somewhere for some reason so this place will be pretty much empty. I'm sure both the people that read this blog will be very saddened by this touching news. Anyway I gotta go eat something before my trip so see you Friday or Saturday.
