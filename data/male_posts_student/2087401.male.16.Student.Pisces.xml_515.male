I apologize for sunday, it was largely my fault we weren't involved, but I'm bringing board games to the next meeting, because hide and seek is just really boring when it's not a lock-in.  Especially when your locked out of the hiding place the first game and yelled at for not playing the second.  Still, I'm all for a more unified youth group, where we can actually plan things, but just by our nature we're going to be atleast slightly disorganized, and Patty needs to realize this and work with us instead of helping to create an atmosphere in which we're working against her.  Perhaps Erin is right, and she isn't the person to be working with older kids.  I'm hoping you(jonah) can take a little more control, I feel like under your leadership that we can be, for the most part, self directed and Patty can worry about the younger kids.  Who added this template? It's stupid. It's not funny, just stupid. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.
