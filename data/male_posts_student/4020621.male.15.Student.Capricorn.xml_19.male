It’s the feeling that I’m seeking, If I deny my true feelings, Then its me myself tat i'm cheating. Hence…  I keep on waiting…  Its true she once hurt me deep, But she too gave me the love I need.. So I won’t admit my defeat, Stand up,n dance with the music to the beat.  Yet autumn after autumns, spring after springs, Time passes, just in a wink… He was mine, only in dreams, The dreams were sweet, like cookies n cream!!  One day she called, “its just another chat” I thought, He said, “I feel for you”, THAT gave me a shock!!~ Was it April fool’s day? I realized its not, I felt as if I’d conquered the mountain top!  sHe asked if I was willing to wait. Leaving the relationship to the fate. He hopes by then its not too late, To make up for her past mistakes….  Dear fate, play me out not, I really love her lots n lots... give us the chance to b together again, its the only cure to my greatest pain..
