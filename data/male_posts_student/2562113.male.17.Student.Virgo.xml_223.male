Last Saturday night I went downtown with Karla, Emily, and Danielle to go to the Post (the most popular Albany college bar). We stopped by some sorority house to pregame before heading to the bar. I thought this was going to be a crappy little party but no, there were THREE KEGS, BUCKETS OF PUNCH, BEER PONG, AND TONS OF PEOPLE!!! I found a nice little spot near the keg and started pounding cup after cup. 6 or 7 cups later I was absolutely hammered and it was time to head to the Post. Along the way to the Post I lost the girls either in the confusion of the crowd or the fact that I was just too drunk to comprehend anything. I tried calling Karla but her phone was off. At this point, the buses were no longer running and the cabs are impossible to catch by yourself so I decided that I was completely fucked......I started walking (stumbling, rather) back to campus......the dreaded infamous 3 mile walk from the Post to uptown.......at 2 in the morning.....all by myself. I made it back to the dorm alive in about an hour or so but some point along the way I can remember some homeless bums/crackheads yelling at me as I was journeying along Western Ave.......that just made me run a little faster. An interesting adventure and a great college story, to say the least.  Finals are coming up and the semester is coming to an end........boy am I going to miss college.....  -BIGsmut
