I'd still have to live of my folks , but thats only until i beginto fly. Once i do, theres no holding me back . I'll repay them with the debts ive incurred, which is currently 10000GBP. A lotta money. lol im neck deep in debt, neck deep in love with a gal whom i;d probably never meet (for her sake atleast) andI have nothing to hold on to    When all that you wanted     And all that you had     Donâ€™t seem so much     For you to hold on to     For you to belong to     [JET : Hold On ]
