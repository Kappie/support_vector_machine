"umm...that was my chauffeur...my, um, jaguar's still in the garage, getting, um, a 4th exhaust pipe installed..." first game, in our sharp red/black/white bowling shoes, i bowled a 78, but jill got a 71 to cheat me out of last place. my bro got a...137? pwah! he had a celebration dance...you don't wanna know. mom got 134, she used to be in a bowling league. 2nd game, i found my mistake (step too close to left) and got a 132. that's cuz jill got a strike for me. and the pins didn't reset after one frame, so i got a 3rd roll! bro got...104-ish, mom was 130?...jill got 70. it's ok, cuz she can drive and take pictures and she has awesome sunglasses. mom's like..."wow that's jill? isn't she stunning?" "mom...she's my cousin..." then dinner, had japanese food, talked about reality shoes. yup, i did it again. shows. don't watch banzai! their japanese accents are so bad, they kinda sound british...and that's about it.
