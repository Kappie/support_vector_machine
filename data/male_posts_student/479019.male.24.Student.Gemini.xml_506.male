I will wake up with a smile just for you." - Consumed   Normally I don't dig the same old lovey poppy songs that 80% of musicians out there write, but Consumed's "Wake Up With a Smile" is done in an aggressive enough way that it doesn't annoy me. No fucking emo bitch that needs to grow some balls...  Anyway today I got my drive kit replaced and the new one's running great. Afterwards I had lunch with George at Fuddruckers... the home of the best fucking hamburgers. Then I paid the high school a visit... man if I wasn't so out of shape I would have totally whooped Manual's ass. I just just sprawling hard on all his shots and hitting front headlocks... but I didn't have the energy to shoot. Also I didn't want to mess up my clothes, since I was street clothes.  Then it was some AOM and TV... I need to make dinner and do some reading later. I want to get through a few chapters of  Privatopia  tonight.  ***
