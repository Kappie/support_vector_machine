These 4 boys from Ohio just know how to play a perfect punk rawk! Check them out in their last cd, two lefts don't make a right...but three do, and of course songs like: "Marilyn Manson Ate my Girlfriend" and "Chapstick, Chapped Lips, and things like Chemestry". By the way, this is a desktop background, you can get it by pressing the buttons in your mouse and all that other stuff...     This picture was taken by someone with a camera...
