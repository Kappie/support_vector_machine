It's both faster, more powerful, and better looking than Outlook! urlLink     If you're looking for a fast email program, that's completely customizable, and has a nice interface, look no further.  Mozilla recently released Mozilla Thunderbird, which is their equivalent to Microsoft Outlook.  And guess what.  It, like Firefox, is better than a Microsoft program.  It's faster, it's got everything you need, and it makes checking email and newsgroups even easier than ever before.    To run Mozilla Thunderbird, you have to have a POP3 email account.  You can find millions of these kinds of email accounts online for free, or, if you run a website of any kind, they're easy to get, as well.  They normally come with your web server.  But, anyway, you can also run Hotmail, Gmail, and Yahoo Mail on them, but you'll have to download special programs in order to do this.    The main thing that sets Mozilla Thunderbird apart from Microsoft Outlook is the fact that it is so much faster, and has a much better interface.  Everything that Mozilla puts out is based on the Netscape technology, which is faster than Microsoft's Explorer Technology.  So, you get blazing speeds, even if you're on a slower connection, and its free.  As long as you have a POP3 or IMAP account, you can run this program without problems.  Mozilla Thunderbird is the ultimate companion to Mozilla Firefox, and, if you're on a slow connection, then you definitely need to download these two programs and let them show you how the internet is really supposed to work.  Now if we could only get them to let out their own email service...then it would be perfect.  I give Mozilla Thunderbird, the next generation email program, a stunning  4 out of 5.
