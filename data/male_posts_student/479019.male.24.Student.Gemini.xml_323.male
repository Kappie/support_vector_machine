While we didn't see eye to eye on some stuff, things ended relatively amicably after a few months. I also do feel like I owe her alot in terms of introducing me to my culture. So I wish her the best of luck with everything.  While it's weird... it's a really heart warming to see good things happen to people. I also heard my next door neighbor from my dorm freshman year is engaged now too.   Well... I guess I'll always have my nude paintings to keep me occupied until a real girl who likes me back or doesn't have lesbian tendencies comes around. Yea... I was painting today. It's nice to hold a brush again.  ***
