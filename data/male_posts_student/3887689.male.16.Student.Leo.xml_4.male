Today is a day for celebration because this is my (*loud horns blare, old man has heart attack due to unexpected blaring of loud horns*) 10TH ENTRY! True, the 10th entry really isn't that important of a milestone, but...well...fuck you! This is my blog, I can do whatever I want! So, in celebration of this, why don't we look back at some of the best moments in Jeff's Blog history. Remember that one where I dissed vegetarians? That was awesome! Oh! And that one where I talked about gay marriage! That wasreally cool. Oh! And the one where I was all like, "Goths are totally conformist." That ruled! Looking back on all this has brought the predicted salty tears of nostalgia to come forth. I love you guys. Even George Bush, vegetarians, and goths. Hooray for people! No matter how stupid you may seem at times, you surprise me again and again.
