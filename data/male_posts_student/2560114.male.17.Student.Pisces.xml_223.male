Plus she lost my essay on bein a stand-up comedian so i have to print that shit again...so yeah. Well practice was productive though, at the beginning casey took us to the team room and jus told us about what we needed to work on and jus play tuff in the playoffz. Then we jus did hittin linez i one of the 4z i hit was probly one of the best hitz i ever had...loco. Then blockin was a big part of practice so it was really good.
