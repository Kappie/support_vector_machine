Hopefully soon you'll be able to take a peek inside the exciting, freaky and often boring as fuck mind of one young chappie from a place you never want to visit and never will, tune in later for some accounts of what i do with my days in tht in-between phase where im not in school and not in uni yet, spending countless hours watching utter shite on the tv, talking utter shite on msn and thinking strange thoughts of a various nature including, but not limited to: squirrels and other woodland creatures, bewinged harbingers of doom and a 5o foot plutonium bum. Ciao.
