Well we went and I shot the best round of my life! I was very happy! but i didnt tell selena that because i just figured she would be like oh thats nice whatever! and i mean its a really big accomplishment i have never shot three over par ever since i started playing gol fi thas been 6 or maybe even 10 over and i just did plane good today! Well then we were getting ready to leave for our DCI thing and well my mom ended up screwing up so that we didnt go and that made me so mad because I let selena down so much and all of that! Well after that i invited Nathan over to spend the night in which we went to movie gallery and got "welcome to mooseport" and "suburban nightmare" they both look like really good movies! Well then we went to see Dodgeball which is a hillarious movie but jolei kept being stupid and I just wasnt happy with her! Well i think that im done now! wait gotta pray...dear father please bless selena and her family bless nathan and his family and may everyone sleep well tonight father amen! Well all good night!
