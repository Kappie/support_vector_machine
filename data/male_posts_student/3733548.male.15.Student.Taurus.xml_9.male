Im awake now and I have nothing to do, and im still tired, but I can't get back to sleep, im up now, what do ya want!? okay, well, i wanna do something today, so when mom gets back from Home depot, (shes been there for about 2 hours now, I wonder what shes doing!?) I'll see if we can go to the mall, and Amanda was saying she was gonna be bored today, so I'll see if she wants to come, better check her journal, and see if shes been online yet... and then I'll have to get off-line to call her... I'll post more later! g'day mates!
