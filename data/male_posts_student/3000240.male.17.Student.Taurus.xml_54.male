Maybe because there's no agitation or nerves (well except tonight maybe as the mighty Tooting and Mitcham are in some obscure cup final which I'm going to with Ian - COME ON YOU TOOTS YEH!!) about football anymore and the fact I've decided that my Christian theories are fairly useless and so I'll stop relying on signs from God (read into what I would have done if Chelsea beat Monaco last night) and just go for things on my own terms and accord. Hopefully it will work; hopefully.  Was also thinking as you may have gathered I tend to do it quite a fair bit, to try to sway every open minded music lovers, if they don't already, onto Nine Inch Nails. I copied a while back, one almighty CD with 12 of there best tracks on them and it tingles my spine every time I listen to it. Just marvelous. Ciao children. xBuBzx
