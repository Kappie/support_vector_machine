I don't dare to sleep la.   Heh. Coward. Yeah. Met CQ at 10 to go oral. We can't find Mr Yeo at first leh. We searched high and low for him and he's not in his office. CQ went to study area to take a rest while I continued searching.  Lo and behold! I found our savior! Gloria's teacher, Mdm Chueng, was walking past me. I called her "Cheng lau shi dui ma?" She turned around and said yeah. I asked her where is Mr Yeo, she went in and said he's not in there. Then she offered to call him on her phone, and he turned out to be in the Haven. Such a good teacher.  Me and CQ went up to meet him. He's giving his class (Clar's class, we saw her) oral first. Hmm. We waited for a while.   Hmm. soon. It was my turn to practise the passage. Well. It's generally very easy. I knew almost all the words. Except for 'ji lei', which I totally forgot how to pronounce. I did reasonably well in this section. For conversation leh,I sucked terribly. I was asked about National Day and all. Well, I was trying to lead my answers to what I want to talk about (participating in NDP), but that made my answers didn't answer his questions. Right.   CQ didn't fare that much better. Oh well. We invited WQ and Gloria to come out to have lunch. Aniticipating long arrivals, we walked all the way from PJ to CCK Station. Not bad leh. Only takes 15 minutes.  They came at 12.15. anyway, only me and WQ ate. Gloria ate, and CQ has no mood to eat. Sigh. We ate LJS. Right. I was laughing about jokes. Laughed laughed laughed. Okay. We met Janet while going out. Hmm.   We went back to school for PW lecture. Well, that lecture was not bad. I took notes. As a Secretary... well, actually not really la. I began to take notes, but then I didn't feel like taking them later. However, I felt that since I wrote something, I might as well carry on. And so carried on taking notes I did. Quite interesting la.   Yeah. I came back, bathed, ate dinner, watched TV and came online.  Sigh. I'm worried about Wendy. Terribly worried. Wendy, I know I told you this le. I am telling you again. I'll be there for you. I will be there for you when everything goes wrong. I'll be there for you when everything is right. I'll always be there for you. I ain't abandoning you, no matter what you choose. I don't approve/support your decision doesn't mean that I will abandon you. :)  Yeah. I go sleep liao wor. See ya! TaTa! Morning blog!
