As I usually have a hard enough time with ONE game, I was certain that I would breathe my last with about 10 minutes left in game 2.  I made appropriate Final Arrangements with my wife before heading to the rink.  The first game went well, despite the predictable high score.  We won 12-11 with the winning goal coming with 21 seconds left.  We played the best team in the league so far, handing them their first loss.  Again, the speed of the players here is difficult to believe.  Despite giving up 11, I played solid and made numerous saves that felt like the old days.  I lost count of the number of 2-1, 3-1, 3-0 and outright breakaways, and I acquited myself well.  When Game 2 started, most of my guys were barely moving, especially after coming off such a close, intense game.  We were down 10-5 at the end of the first half, and as evidenced by the score, I was playing quite poorly.  The fatigue was certainly catching up with me, but I can, in good conscience, dish a small portion of blame to my teammates for failing to cover anybody in the slot.  At least 4 of the goals were back door plays, leaving me all by myself.  Things changed a little at the half when we rested, and then immediately burned our timeout for a few more minutes of rest.  The quality of play improved all the way around, bring us to a score of 15-13 with two minutes left.  Then 15-15 with 60 seconds to go.  We took the lead at 16-15 with 40 seconds left on an amazing sequence of purely satanic give and go passes.  It reminded me of the Tampa Bay goal.  The final 40 seconds was a seige, with the other team just pounding away from eight feet.  I have no idea how I stopped so many shots, but it was as if someone was standing there with a bag of pucks, throwing them at me as fast as they could.  I don't mind to admitting luck had a great deal to do with it.  So we ended up 2-0 for the day, and despite the score, I was quite pleased.  I'm certainly feeling it today, but it is a pleasant sort of ache.  The kind of pain where you know it has been good for you.  I was invited to fill in tonight for the women again, but I passed.  I'm thinking about calling the rink and agreeing to go in, but haven't decided.  Looking forward to Steve's update on how many penalties he called, and how often he avoided getting in the way.  After watching our ref dodging pucks, it occured to me the ref is the anti-goalie.
