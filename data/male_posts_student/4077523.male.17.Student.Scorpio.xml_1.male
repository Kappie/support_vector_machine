I am just sitting here and my family is at a water park, I chose not to go to it because first off I am not really in the mood due to previous circumstances which brought me down, and b I never really liked doing family trips because they seem to be boring. If I did the family vacation myself I would not make it boring.    The youth ministry I am a part of came back from Beach Blast yesterday. B.B. is a camp we go to that we make ourselves. I wasn't able to go because of Band Camp, my band director wouldn't let me go. It is the only trip that I want to go on and really work for even if I go on others. I wish I could have gone because if I did go I wouldn't have been through what I went through this week, and Justin had the nerve to instant message me and say "You missed out."That is the last thing I want to hear, number one because I know I missed out on something better than this, and number two it wasn't my choice to miss out on B.B. because my mom made me, it was her money and at the time I didn't have enough to pay for the trip. It is really hard trying to see what God wants for me even after going through stuff like this. But, I pray I will see and I probably wont see until after it is over and hindsight is a beautiful thing. I could use everyones prayer that reads this, and thanks. -De Colores
