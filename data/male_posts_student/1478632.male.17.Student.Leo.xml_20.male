Funny, huh?  I've moved on though. Why? Because I got a car! It's a 2000 Daewoo Nubria, fully loaded with only 43,000 miles on it. I got it for $3,650 (USD). It gets about 35 miles per gallon, and it has a lot of vertical headroom. I like it. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's an automatic :(. Oh well, you can't get everything, huh?  urlLink Here  is a picture of a car that looks just like it, just more expensive. The guy that I bought it from doesn't have a license to sell cars that have been in accidents, so I know its clean. He's going to have it inspected and make sure that everything is good on it before I can take it from his lot, so I know it'll be in good working order. I drove it, so I know it runs. I'm happy. Guess what else I have to tell you? I got a job at Market Basket! Yay! I'll be starting tonarrow at 3:30 and I'll be getting $7.00/hr. It's not much, but it's $7.00/hr that I wasn't making before, plus it gives me something constructive to do in the afternoons. A bunch of my friends work there too, so it can't be horrible or anything, plus if I need a day or a few off, I just ask my boss a week in advance and he'll put it in the schedule. Yay! That's about all I have to post tonight. Later, y'all.  --Raine
