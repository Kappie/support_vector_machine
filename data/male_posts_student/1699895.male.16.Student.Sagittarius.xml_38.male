I have a 105.7% in biology right now, which is cool enough to say the least.  Also I am doing great in Sci-Fi  I am failing sports....what a lost =( YEAH RIGHT how can u not get an A?  Today was okay, just really tired right now and i think i am going to take a nap in a few  I feel like taking won of those retarded quizilla thingys because I really have nothing to do, but I figure a nap is just as good as not being cool, or wait...what? i need sleep  Wings last game is agaisnt the Blue Jackets tommarow, and they are not going to be happy to be playing with kirk maltby at the same time. They are either gonna kick there ass or just be afraid of M-by  bye
