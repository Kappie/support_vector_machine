Well, I certainly appreciated the movie better when I watched it the second time. I didn't concentrate so much on the plot. I looked at the mechanics of the movie. It's a very nice movie! The rat was more prominently featured. Yes! I still loved Professor Trelawney! I was pondering over the question "Would it be the same if they didn't go back? At that time when they were about to go back, Black has been saved. Why bother going back?" someone posted in SGSB. I think they should go back. Number 1, if they didn't, there are going to be 2 Hermiones and Harrys stuck at the same time. Secondly, the 'future' Herimone and Harry are there because the 'past' friends went back. If they didn't go back in time, the 'future' Hermione and Harry wouldn't exist. Therefore, what they did will come to naught. Besides, what the 'past' friends experienced is because of what the 'future' friends did. The timeline MUST be continued! I know I am confusing. HaHa! They have to go back...Yeah.   Okay. After the movie was choir. Choir was a bit tiring. I was hungry, tired, sore-throat and I can't even pitch AT ALL! Sigh...   Well. Today sucks. I made CQ angry. You see. We were filling feedback forms. CQ asked me must write the class or not. I misheard it as whether must write the name or not. I got pissed off and said "ayiah..write name won't kill you one!" and wrote my name in big letters on top. I was writing my answers, I misheard and I got irritated. I hate it when people ask me stuff that the teachers/people have instructed a few moments ago (that's why I keep glaring at JunSheng [CQ kept glaring at me whenever I give JS my evil look] when he ask stupid questions like this...PEOPLE! PAY ATTENTION!). When I get irritated, I just shot out my irration. Like natural reaction. I cannot control one lor. Adding worse is that I MISHEARD CQ's question. Sigh...now's he angry with me. All my fault la!   Sigh. I also kinda insulted Amanda. I was messaging WQ and it goes something like this "You terrible idiot! I just watched Harry the second time, and I appreciated the movie more when I didn't care about the plot". I wanted to tell Amanda about the appreication part, so I sent it to her too, forgetting there's a "you terrible idiot" part in front. Oppsie! She didn't reply...so I don't know whether she got offended or not. She might be in a bad mood when reading my sms. Sigh...   Ayiah...stupid la. I think I end my blog here. Oh yes! I had a very nice time with Noriko, chatting. :D Right. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
