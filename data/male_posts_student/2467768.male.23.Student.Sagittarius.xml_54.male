Their associate members now will be able to know each other events, club's news, etc. They can also participate in the discussion forum.  The web team will be appreciated if the plan will be going well, and this will be another milestone for the site to give services to the community. This will also encourage the two groups to work together and bring the live of students in Wollongong.
