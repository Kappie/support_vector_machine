Then took a shower ate breakfast... all that fun stuff and went to X-country. small turnout [3 guys 2 girls] So i was the fastest guy there and i had to set the pace [i hate that] So anyway I had no way of reaching anisia after that [we were going to go to commonwealth] so i went home. Now I'm talking to her online and she hurt her back skating. [i'm sorry anisia] But she doesn't seem like her normal self right now so I'm gonna go figure out that.  Catch you cats on the flip flop later
