Well then at 3rd period i wrote her a letter sayin how i felt about the whole situation and what not, so yeah...then i had to leave at 5th period cuz i was "suppose" to go get a shot, so when we (me and mi madre) went to the doctorz office on base, i was greeted with screaming children and horrify soundz coming from those children...insane yes quite...this one kid had to b held down by 3 doctorz, muy loco...well then instead of takin only 1 shot, i had to take a total of 3...yes folkz...3 freakin shotz...well the 1st one was semi-painful, the put the needle under the skin of my forearm. Then the next 2 shotz were shot into my left and right shoulder...they were shot out of this crazy gun thingy, the one of the left didnt hurt at all, but the one of the right hurt like all mighty hell had been unleashed on my arm...so yeah...pretty sore...laterz.
