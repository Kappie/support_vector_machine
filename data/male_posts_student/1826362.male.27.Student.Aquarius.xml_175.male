And I realize that sincerity is out of fashion these days, and that what I'm about to say will be totally insincere, but it is an attempt to convey in an insincere way a moment that was sincere.  This play made me an emotional wreck.  It made me sad and happy and it made me think about my life and my own father and about how good of a dad he is. Hi dad! I love you!  And it made me wonder why it's so hard for people to talk to one another.
