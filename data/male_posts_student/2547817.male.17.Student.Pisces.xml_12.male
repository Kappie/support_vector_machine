I don't wanna forget. I can, can't I? I think I can. Oh crap, I'm not sure. In doubt of my own ability to disown something I love. At least it proves that I have a heart. Thanks.  I don't feel I have much to thank God for. Though I know I owe Him my life, it seems that giving thanks for my breath would be a pathetic attempt to scrounge for a reason to give thanks.  I hope I'm not left out of the book of life for what I feel. Shan't elaborate any further, lest I come under reprimandative fire and inquiry as to whether or not I am fully equipped with limbs. F.I.S.H. knows what I mean.  Leave me not out of the book of life.
