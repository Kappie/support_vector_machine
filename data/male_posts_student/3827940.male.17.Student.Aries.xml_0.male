And SmackDown! will just either bring about decent or if they really wanted to, a pretty watchable match. How things have changed ever since the brand extension in March this year. It was the beginning of the rocket blast off of RAW, as well as the well documnted downfall of SmackDown!. Going into this year's Summerslam, the situation has switched in full force with RAW being the dominant brand and continuing to flourish, while SmackDown! continues to drift into obscurity. I look foward to Summerslam as it has delivred in to some extent in most years, and I expect no less than a very exiting program considering the situation that the brands are in, and don't take that as a compliment for SmackDown!. It's just that, maybe, just maybe this will motivate some of guys from SmackDown! on the card to give out something meaningful whether it's promos or matches. I as well as many others am liking the way the situation from RAW seems to stack up. And now it looks even clearer because of Vengeance just concluding about an hour ago. I won't say much more negative comments about SmackDown!, instead I'll just go ahead and post the possible card from both brands for this year's Summerslam event.        Summerslam 2004 (The RAW half)  World Heavyweight Championship Chris Benoit (c) vs. Triple H I expect Benoit to drop World Championship here at Summerslam. I would like for Benoit to actually hold the championship until Survivor Series, but I'm not sure at all that would happen. So it's probably a ood estimate to say Benoit will lose here at Summerslam to Triple H in a Vengeance rematch.  Intercontinental Championship Edge (c) vs. Randy Orton In another Vengeance rematch, I see Edge retaining the belt and Orton staying afloat without the Intercontinental Championship. Who knows, maybe Orton can tag with Batista or just stay in the Intercontinental hunt, but I don't think it would make all that much sense because I see Edge having moderately long reign. And having Orton in the direct hunt, wouldn't help the reign as sooner or later Orton would have to win the belt back. I'm not saying Orton won't or shouldn't win it back, but Orton can only stay so long with the belt if he's in the direct hunt. So I see a possible Benjamin return where he cost Orton any chances at winning the belt or revives their little feud from April-June 2004. Edge retains and remains the champion.  World Tag Team Championship La Resistance (c) vs. Eugene/William Regal I say after HHH and the rest of Evolution attack Eugene for costing Triple the victory at Vengeance, William Regal should go out and check on eugene while getting jumped himself after that. The two then revitalize their friendship and challenge for the World Tag Team Championship. In this match it could go either way. But seeing Eugene and Regal win the World Tag Team Championship would hype the crowd for the rest of the night.  Chris Jericho vs. Batista w/Ric Flair Yet again another rematch but it's worth another try and spot on the card. Personally this time, Jericho should go over. He's already been pumbeled a couple of times by Batista, so it's fair to give this one to Jericho. The match would probably be the same as Vengeance, but the result will possibly be shocking. If this guy doesn't return on a RAW before Summerslam this match will most likely happen, but if he doesn't it would've been a different story. So if he hasn't already made his return and this match is scheduled, I expect Christian to attack Jericho after and make his big return after this match at Summerslam. I think the Jericho/Christian isn't quite over and needs some conclusion to it rather than it ending in a steel cage which gave Christian his back injury in the first place.  Falls Count Anywhere Kane vs. Matt Hardy w/Lita Well, the RAW half mostly consists of rematches but it'as only for the sake of concluding those specific matches and that is the true way I see it going down this year. Well, I see Kane winning, and putting Hardy out of action for awhile. It'll continue to to try and build up Kane's monster persona and lead him into his feud with Michaels which will happen at Survivor Series if you ask me.
