That afro hair guy did look like clay but i onli managed to see the sideview. haha, but he very weird lor, dressed the way PAP would at todae's NDP.  Ydae's CIP was crazy. we got a nice spot to take picture of and watch the fireworks too. haha, thanks to elsa. after that was chaotic cos all the crowd tried to jay-walk across the road to marina shopping centre ( i think that's the name). of cos, we broke the rule too. some time later, we reached suntec city. that place sux! we spent 1 hour juz to search for affordable food with short Q. in the end, we settled with sandwiches from carrefour's delight corner. haha. den, going home from suntec is problematic too. since the collaspe of nicoll highway, many suntec's busstop are no longer in use. *damn it* once again, like last week, nus and i ( this time plus a couple more ppl) were trapped at suntec. we finally boarded a bus from esplanade (it's still crowded, think 5566 went to perform, i saw them when i'm on the bus) at 11+. needless to say, by the time i rched home, it's   THE NEXT DAY !!!      nevermind, juz to let S08s noe, i've never regretted to sign up for this CIP. Though it's not a nice way to spend a sunday, we got to spend it together in an interesting way. isn't it fun that we cracked our brains and try to find a way out together. that would certainly bind us together. heehee. haha,   love you guys and gals, we rock!!!
