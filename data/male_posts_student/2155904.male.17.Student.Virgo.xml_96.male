Saturday was a decent day.  Tyke didn't do too much in the means of going places though.  He woke up about 11:30 and his mom, as usual, greeted him with "Morning, sleepy head" as she almost always does on Saturdays cuz he sleeps with reckless abandonment.  After getting up he talked to Haras for a little while about her Friday night and their plans and such.  Nice and relaxing to start off Saturday.  His brother had come home for a few hours so they chatted and played some PS2 together.  Then he left and right afterwards he went to Cougar Ridge to watch some of the Amed-Skippy battle of the ball.  Basketball.  Skippy ended up taking the W 19-17 and that meant that Amed owed him a dinner.  They decided to go to Teriyaki Bistro for the meal.  Well, Tyke ended up going home right after that as there was nothing else to do.  But he took a circuitous route home.  He went down to South Cove after getting off the mountain and took the Meerwood turn, dropping by Purdy's neighborhood.  He didn't go to her house, just past the turn into her neighborhood.  Then he went towards Tina's house but turned up to get back on the main road before going to her actual house.  He drove by Tig'Ol on that path so it ended up being a positive decision to take that route.  Just because he saw one person.  It was successful.  He came home and then just sorta sat around for like 4 hours.  He talked to Purdy for a while.  They talked about traveling some and about Tyke's trip to Europe and how Purdy should come with him but can't.  Sorta like nobody will be able to come with him cuz they would have to pay for their own airfare so that would cost like $2000.  But if you want to go with him, still just let him know and he will see about getting you in.  That is, if he would like for you to come along.  And there are some of you he would really like to have come along.  After talking to her he had dinner with his family and he doesn't remember what they talked about.  Then he helped his dad put some phone numbers into his cell phone (which he got about 6 months ago).  After that he went downstairs and waited for Skippy, Amed, K-caj, and Kinker to come over.  They started off with MOH and while playing the game K-caj showed off his new songs on the piano.  A few tunes from Mario!!!  It is hella tight really.  Like the star song is really cool.  But they are all really good.  Macaroon came over later and brought Halo so they played that for a while.  Tyke and Skippy owned after the first round.  They lost only once.  It was great.  Actually, it was just fine.  Decent, adequate.  Average.  However, the best part of the night came when it was just Tyke, Kinker, and Macaroon.  They started playing cards and they played Shithead and then Ratscrew.  It was fun but then they started playing one of the best card games ever.  It started out with the game Bingo.  This is not the Bingo you know.  This is the Bingo that was created at Dr. Phil's house over the summer by Macaroon, Tyke, and Dr. Phil.  However, Tyke decided to start changing the rules and he did.  Then Kinker and Macaroon did the same.  And they created....CHINKO!!!!  This game is so much fun.  It is a mixture of many different games.  Some of these include Gin Rummy, Jenga, Memory Match, Basketball, and Go Fish.  These are just the noticeable ones.  There are prolly others too.  The game is just a jumbled mess of cards scattered all around.  And then you have to match cards and stuff.  He doesn't want to explain it on here cuz it takes away from some of the fun of the LIVE EXPERIENCE.  But next time you are with Tyke and run out of things to do but have cards, just play this game.  It is better with more people though.  It is so much fun.  Wow, he really loved playing.  Tyke is going to try and keep thinking of ways to add to the game.  He is trying to see if there is a way he could toss in the element of betting to the game.  Perhaps, and if he does then it would probably be enjoyed by even more people.  So anyway, his day was somewhat eventful but he is still really happy from his Friday night.  That was a great night.  He just keeps looking back and saying that it was really fun and wants to do it again soon.  Real soon.  Like EVERYDAY!!!  That would be fun.  It was funny and entertaining.  Kinda like Tyke Turner.  Actually, very much like Tyke.  Just imagine all the little kids who are saying "I wanna be like Tyke."  He could maybe even make a commercial for his blog that included a bunch of kids saying "I wanna be like Tyke."  Would you want to be in the commercial?
