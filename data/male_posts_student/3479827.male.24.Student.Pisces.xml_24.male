My miniscule bed is getting quite uncomfortable. What doesn't help is that the old couple beneath us are snoring like angry tigers (not me this time!) this is really quite boring, i'm really looking forward to arriving now :)  i ate a small dinner served on a sectioned metal tray. It comprised tofu, green peppers, pork and rice. It was passable enough for the 15 yuan price (1 pound) well, we're on the move again, i'll try and sleep now. For those of you reading this by email, i attach a picture of my bunk.
