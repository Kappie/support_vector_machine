And you know what is cool about it? Well, at least I think it's cool, because I'm Sir Geeksalot of Gamesingham. Yeah, it's a video game. Ps2, baby. But Tim and the people that created it are helping make it, and I watched videos and pictures of the game, and it looks just like the original movie. The only big question I have about it is the involvement of a certain Mr. Elfman. There's all new songs that everybody sings and the background music is new but it sounds like music from the movie. I just don't know if the Oingo man himself is making it. He really should.  No idea when it's coming out though. They keep pushing the release date back. And, imagine that, Buena Vista is in charge of publishing it. The same bastards that have been depriving me of   Ed Wood   for two years now. God, I hate you Buena Vista.  You know what? I can't believe that I forgot about Tim's upcoming movie.   Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  . A lot of the casting has been done. His girlyfriend Helena is going to be Mrs. Bucket. All the kids are pretty new at acting. The kid playing Charlie looks cute as hell. But it doesn't really matter who else is in the movie since Sir Deppington of Manlysville is playing the lead. He's going to steal the show.  Oh man. Ralph Fiennes (which I've discovered is pronounced something like Rafe Fines) is gonna rock. You know what I'm talkin' bout.  We went over to my aunt's house in Orenco today for dinner. Adam and his girl and I played Halo for way too long. Dude, I suck at that. But it's my brother's fault. I used to be King Killingston of Halotown. Then John took the Xbox over to Sarah's house. That was, what? Two years ago? Yeah. No joke. Even though that one Christmas that our parents gave us the Xbox, John bitched and moaned because he wanted a Gamecube instead. Then I get a Gamecube a year later, and he makes fun of me for it. But that basically sums up John.  Holy shit, that reminds me of those Subway commercials with the kid that complains that his brother used to make fun of him because he was a big, fat, fatso, fattypants. A FAT FUCK! Those were Subway, right? Anyways, I laughed a lot.  After Halo, Adam and Danni and I went over to Taco Bell. In Danni's convertable Volkswagen Cabriolet, which is a fucking cool car. I don't care if Volkswagens are primarily driven by women and considered by many to be "chick cars," I'm getting one.  Adam and I were in shock to see that Taco Bell had a brand new, only found in Taco Bells Mountain Dew. It was called Baja Bash, or something like that. I bought one and, dude, disappointing. It's like Mountain Dew mixed with Sierra Mist or some crap like that. That's the first time the fine folks at Mountain Dew have ever let me down. I love the original, I love Code Red, and I especially love my Livewire. But I guess they've run out of ideas.  But that was fun. Adam has the same taste of movies as I. He told me how since he saw the preview for it in front of   Eternal Sunshine  , he's had an uncontrollable urge to see   Garden State  .  Oh, before we left, I went to Stephen Lynch's website, because I haven't been there in a long, long, long time, and I almost pissed my hot, hot pants. There has been talk of a Stephen Lynch Dvd for many a moon now, but it's finally coming out in September. Stephen Lynch: Live at the El Ray. They have a preview of it on there of him singing Special Ed, and it's so fucking cool. After the part about getting hit in the head by Ed, he starts dancing around the stage like he's retarded, and when he returns to the microphone, he says, "I'm strong! Like Hulk! Arrr! My shoes hurt!" and then he yells out the name of the Tv show he quoted. If you don't know what he's talking about, then I dub you Sir Dumbington of Lamescatraz. Or Lady Dumington of Lamescatraz for all you lady readers. Or L.A.M.E.R.O.B.O. Unit 139485023C for all you robot readers out there. Or 1000101101001110010101 for all you binary readers.  I took that one a bit too far.  But a Stephen Lynch Dvd. It's gonna have everything he played when Kit, Ian, and I saw him in concert, and a commentary track by The Man, Mark, and Drew. Awesome, awesome, awesome. I cannot wait.  I took a big risk. A huge, huge risk. A huge, funny risk. I made my parents listen to   Superhero   on the drive out to Orenco. To my surprise, they thought he was really funny and creative, albeit crude and discgusting. I panicked about "The Best Friends Song," but luckily, my mom got lost right at the end part and turned the music down. When she found the right road, she turned it up and it was on the next song. I sighed a sigh of relief.    But all that meant no clothes shopping with Lady Kittington of Hipsterland (and her merry group of followers, Squire Nattonberg of Artsoncove and Madame Sydningsing of Sisterton). But tomorrow. For sure, tomorrow. Parents gave me $170ish. Is that enough?  And hopefully,   Garden State   tomorrow. I can't wait any longer. I just can't.  I went through my parent's Cd collection to see if there was anything that interested me, and out of about 250ish Cd's, all I found was a Tom Petty Greatest Hits, a Heart Greatest Hits, A John Lennon Greatest Hits, a Stray Cats Greatest Hits, and crap, after crap, after crap. I saw two, TWO,   FUCKING TWO! Kenny G Cd's. And Celine. And Mariah. Dude, it was gross. And I had just showered. Not cool.  Oh yeah, They Might Be Giants was awesome. Awesome, awesome, awesome. They played "The End of the Tour," as they left. Perfect. I love that song with a rock hard passion. And we saw a pirate. A real pirate. Everyone was saying "ARR!" to him, so you know he was real.  My favorite Home Movies episode has always been the Summer Camp one ("I've also been wetting my pants at a fairly regular basis."), and I watched it this morning, and I recognized two familar voices that I hadn't noticed before. John and John of TMBG are the two Junior Music Counselors. They rock, they rock so hard.  I actually have some more to say, but pretzels await me downstairs. (Okay, one last one) I am Lord Hungersly of Appetitesfield.
