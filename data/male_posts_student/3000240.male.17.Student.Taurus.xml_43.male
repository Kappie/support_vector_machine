Well we play Monaco tonight which can only be described as huge. I feel that this match will be significant and ponders a couple of questions for a couple of reasons: isn't this just a little above the station for Chelsea, but we will well and truly never have a better chance of lifting the trophy than we will do in foreseeable evolutionary future. It's a shame that Gallas and Duff are out otherwise I think Ambrosio apart we would have has the strongest 11 available. I think we will be able to do it, but our defense needs to be on top of its game to stop Europe's most prolific goal scoring machine of the year. If we sneak a 1-1 or a 0-1 or even a 2-1 to Monaco I'll be happy, just as long as we score . . . May God be with us tonight. xBuBzx
