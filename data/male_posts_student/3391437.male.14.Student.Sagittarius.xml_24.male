What do you think you should learn now that will come in handy, the rest of your life  The foremost thing I think I should learn today which will come in handy the rest of my life is writing. One can express his feeling, emotions and everything else by writing. There are many different ways of writing. Some of the most famous are essays, poems, stories and news articles. What I am writing right now is an essay. An essay is a group of sentence which describes a particular subject.      I have started writing essays daily since last month. My essay was poorly organized and structural when I first started writing. As time passed on as fast as a speeding bullet, I started writing better. My grammar, my organization of themes and paragraph structure all became better. Not only I have to write essay in home, but also I have to write essay in school in a daily basis. Writing essay is a very good habit because by writing anyone can express their opinions and views clearly.
