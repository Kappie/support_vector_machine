This gave me something to do during the long summer. Every thing went great and I will miss haveing to go to the meetings and doing the other workthat I had to do. Well now I think I have the rest of the summer off and thats a good thing. Well over this weekend I gor Extreamly sick and I am still kinda sick today I have a pain in my stomach but I am sure it will get better soon. Well now I have to go into Pasadena and get my bike fun, fun, fun! Well thats all I have to say for today, so until next entry.
