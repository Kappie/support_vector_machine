Our invigilator looks like one of those PE-teacher type. So PE-teacherish. Anyhoo, the paper was so easy! You can even use logic to answer the questions! It is like...duhz! I am confident of scoring full marks.  Right. After that, me, PY, CQ and Gloria went to help WQ with his PW work. Counting his surveys lor, so he can go off early. Heh. Even ducks counted and meowed.   Yes. After that, we minused PY, went to Causeway Point to eat lunch. I ate kueh chap. Okay la.  After lunch, I brought the cats back. CQ wants to come over to do PW research. Gloria wanted to come along, so why not. I have not planned on adding WQ, but since I felt bad about leaving him out, I inivted him over as well. I have now 3 cats in my house.  Yes. I left them alone for the first hour or so, as I went to bath then watch my Pokemon. Yep.  Ayioh! My room is so small and there are hardly enough room for all of us. Heh. Koo Wen Qiang is very bagua. Reading my conversations wor! No way dude! :P   Heh. It was a utter mess. Fans were being switched on and off. Am I the only one who doesn't find my fan cold? O.o I even fell asleep. Heh.  Right. They finished with their work and began exploring my computer. Siow cats. After that leh, we went outside to talk lor. Talkity talk.   At 5, they went home. Blah blah blah. Ate dinner then watched Simpsons. A lot of cats made guest appearance, like Tony Blair, Ian McKellen and JK Rowling. HaHa! Cool beans!  Right. I think I better go now. I am getting tired. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
