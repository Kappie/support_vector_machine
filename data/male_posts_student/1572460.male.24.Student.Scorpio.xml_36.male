The Top Twenty Rock Songs: #16-20   16)  Led Zeppelin - Ten Years Gone   This is one of my Zepp favorites, right up there with most of their other predictable picks, like Stairway to heaven. Again, far better lyrics than perhaps any other Zepp song. Introspective rock, as they say. I always have a fascination for how a song starts off. It more often than not dictates the rest of the piece. One might think that every song starts off in its own good way. But the truth is, songs like ten years gone separate the good from the best. This is one of those songs that begins with lovely bass notes. Later on, there are some nice distorted electric guitar riffs. This one is also in dropped-D tuning (DADGBE).  17)  Led Zeppelin - That's The Way   Oh, that's the way is another classic. The entire Led Zeppelin III album has an absolutely brilliant acoustic side. The album is as good as or even better than IV, and just got overshadowed by IV. With songs like Friends, Tangerine, Bron-Y-Aur Stomp, and this one, Jimmy Page shows why he is a maestro on the guitar. Throughout his musical career Page was known to play songs in all sorts of wierd tunings, that perhaps only he knew. Which speaks of his risk-taking ability, like no other guitarist ever did. He managed to pull this off regularly on stage. This song is in an open G tuning (DBGDGD). Beautiful strumming patterns. Watch out for the mandolin too!  18)  Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond   I could dedicate an entire thesis dissecting Pink Floyd's music. None of the bands/artists/musicians mentioned in this list have had a bigger impact on me than Floyd. (Yes, Straits/Knopfler did, but that was only with respect to guitaring). Pink Floyd's music is on an entirely different level, and you need to be an  active listener  to appereciate their work. Floyd has been one of the pioneers of conceptualization in music. Their music essentially has an ambience and dreamscape like quality, lots of loops (in which a musical idea is introduced, allowed to disappear, and then re-introduced as the concluding piece), fade-ins/outs, philosophical/satirical lyricism, and plenty of experimentation to keep you guessing. A heady mix of psychedelic blues and progressive rock, they were always unafraid to take risks by composing lengthy songs. Shine On is their  BEST  musical piece. The entire Wish You Were Here album is an example of Floyd at the peak of their musical powers. If I had to buy one rock album, I would buy this one! What a concept! (The "feeling of loss" theme when Syd Barrett left the band). The piece is split into two parts, totally clocking over 25 minutes. It exhibits every musical quality that I have mentioned above. Dick Parry's sax is surprising but marvelous, and one of the most creative shifts I've ever heard in a song, from a melodic state to a soporific one. And don't forget to check out Gilmour's slide guitaring in the second part. Absolute mastery! I feel this was one piece where every band member has something to offer in the song.  19)  Pink Floyd - Dogs   Dogs (17 mins), from the album Animals is another example of the sheer profundity of Floyd. Animals is their most underrated work, and is more rock n' roll-ish than any of their albums. Roger Waters compares people to animals and writes songs to reflect the views of each type (Pigs, Dogs, Sheep). Dogs are seen as the users of others and cut-throat pragmatists. Lyrically and technically, this album is really creative. Roger Waters was not only a tremendous songwriter, but had a great smooth, husky voice to go along with (I think he sounds awesome in the album Meddle!). After their success with Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here, I guess this one was bound to be less successful, and I feel sorry for the band. Nick Mason kicks up a great rhythm in this song and even Richard Wright puts his patented synth effects to some interesting use (like the dog sounds). David Gilmour, is God, as usual.  20)  Pink Floyd - High Hopes   Goodness gracious, what a song to end this list. High Hopes is a post-Waters rock ballad, the finale from their final 1994 album - The Division Bell. A musical career couldn't have ended better. Most die-hard Floyd fans do not especially like the post-Waters era of Floyd, i.e. their last two albums, although not me! It's one of their best written songs, even considering the legacy of Waters (I know it almost doesn't make sense to most, since Gilmour and some Polly Samson wrote this). The theme of the album relates to the division within Pink Floyd that resulted in Roger Waters leaving the band, and the other members searching for an identity without him. Apparently, the album has a different Floyd sound and it takes a while to get used to it. I was practically reduced to tears when I heard this song. Apart from the orchestration, and Gilmour's exceptional ability to make the slide guitar not just sing and talk but also make it sound painful and heartbreaking, the songwriting is just phenomenal, just incredible - do check it out! What a song, and what a great ringing solo to end! Perfect!
