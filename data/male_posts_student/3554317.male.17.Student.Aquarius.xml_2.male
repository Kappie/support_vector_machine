I also made fried calamari, veal parmigiana, grilled fish/chicken/vegetables, and bruschetta pomodoro.  I got off work at 10.  Apparently coffeeshops/everything else closes at 10.  I was going to get an iced coffee, but instead I got nothing.  Main reason why I'm super ultra tired.  In other news, UNDER17 has come to my attention.  They have the cutest vocals I have heard from any j-pop/rock band.  Thank you Kawaii-Radio.net for fulfilling the dreams of my ancestors!  I'ma go sleep. Keep on truckin'.  Current Music: Eastern Youth - Sajin No Kanatae (to the sandstorm)  ^ Saw this Japanese indie rock band live.
