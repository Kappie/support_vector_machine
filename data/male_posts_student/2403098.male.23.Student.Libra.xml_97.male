People linked in from lauren's fantastic  urlLink http://ellekinzy.blogspot.com . Some had gotten there just by typing the address in. There was the person who searched yahoo.com for "Pimps Across The World" and ended up on my site for some reason. But more exciting than even Pimps Across The World (I'm going to start assuming I'm one of them that is representing the mid-states and central Oklahoma region) was that I was linked from a blog that I have not heard of. "wha...?" I said to myself, and went to check said blog out. Someone has linked me on their site under the heading "Favorite Blogs," and better yet: there are only three listed. I am flattered. I'msure that if he ever sees this, he will quickly delete the link because I have now appeared to feel a little too special about the whole ordeal. Seriously though, what a flattery that someone has somehow stumbled onto my weblog and decided it was one of their "Favorite" blogs to read! Of course, I read every entry on his. I enjoyed it quite a lot, and in case you ARE reading this- you've got a new fan too! Thank you mystery person who lives in Chicago of all places (see ya there).   Anyhow. Back to the title of my blog. *Ahem* where was I. OH, I was tired, that's where I was. Last night I got out of the shower and had a message on my cell phone from lauren who said "if you're still up give me a call" (or something to that effect, strewn with racial slurs and curse words though probably). Just kidding, no, but if I was up lauren wanted to talk and so we did.. for.. over.. EIGHT.. hours. SIX and a half of those hours were consecutive. It has been a long time since we have been able to do that, it was like old times. Like old summers that lauren worked the internship at the news channel in Oklahoma City and we would stay up all night bull shitting until finally I would hear something in the background and say "what was that?" She would say "well, that's my alarmclock going offand it's time to 'get up' to go to work." We'd laugh, she'd go to work and I'd take myself a nap. Today, however, roles were reversed and I was sitting on the edge of my bed at 7am when I said "okay, just so you know, I'm going to go ahead and get dressed for class." It didn't stop there. We talked until I was literally walking into the door of my classroom at 8:40am.   On MY watch it felt like it was about 4am, and I had been up all night and was justwinding down and getting sleepy for night-night-time. On everyone else's watch it trulywas in or around the hour of8am and they were not happy tobe out of their beds. It was really weird to see everyone looking depressingly tired, making mouth-love to Styrofoam cups of coffee from 7-11, appearing disgusted to be alive. I, on the other hand, looked better than I've looked for class all summer. I didn't just roll out of bed (didn't get in it at all), so I actually had time to not just throw-on-a-hat-and-go. I felt kind of drunk, to tell you the truth, from lack of sleep. We discussed our case-studies on EuroDisney's failure and subsequent revitalization, and I offered my my insights with full force (much like an intoxicated student would, which I have been intoxicated in class before so I would know, I'll save that for another post). I was on my A-game. I started thinking "shit, I should NOT sleep more often." I had the class laughing at my remarks and I was starting to wonder why I hadn't been so entertaining all summer. When Dr. Gross asked me where I thought the next Disney Endeavor should take place while taking into consideration the mistakes made at EuroDisney, and my reply was "Tulsa." I wasn't serious. Somehow it was funny to sleepy seniors though.   I came home and fell asleep around noon for close to 5 hours. Waking, as if nothing, and "staring" the rest of my day.  Speaking of class, I am finished with class after my exam tomorrow. I will be done with college forever, and I'm having a very hard time letting that information sink in. I was supposed to be done in May, but OOPS road block - I was diverted to summer school. No big deal (psssh, I say that now), and I am finished as of tomorrow at about 9am. Raise your glasses in a toast to me, the new college graduate.   I am getting sad about the things I can't take with me when I move. Of course Iwill miss thereally important things like friends andSonic Drive-in, but I mean the things I don't think about on a daily basis: My washer and dryer, my cheap rent (compared to Chicago anyway), my fire place, my balcony, my plants. I'm actually quite sad about my plants on my balcony. I will feel bad just, like, throwing them away. How DOES one dispose of a plant? I feel like i'm about to abort the poor living things. Shouldn't there be some protocol for doing away with balcony palm trees like there is with disposing of the U.S. flag? I guess I'll burn them or something. Just kidding. The plant in my kitchen though, it WILL go with me. I will take it in my car if I have to. That thing has survived since my freshman dorm room in Tulsa. I will be taking her (i should name her) with me. Just me, Betty (just named her) and the open road.   Goodnight.
