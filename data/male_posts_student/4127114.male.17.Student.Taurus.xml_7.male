The post title is a piss-take of nasty Sue Nelson, who wrote in The Guardian yesterday about how street art is litter. Like wake up and smell the spray paint, Maureen! First, she doesn't make a distinction between normal, unthinking graffiti and thought-out, sourced-material street art, and second, she seems to promote the idea of sanitised blank walls in cities across the UK, which is a) unrealistic, b) creatively stifling, and c) darn boring. Grrr, non-apreciators do me 'ed in.  *Toilet break*. Eeew, eww,  ewww.  I just had a poo ;)    And then dropped the spare key, kept on the toilet cistern, into the loo when flushing it. Accidently. Key - retrieved but unclean. Me - scarred for life...   Smiles.  Soooo  Not smiling  Tsk, shall listen to some Keane to "soothe" me...mmm, piano solos.
