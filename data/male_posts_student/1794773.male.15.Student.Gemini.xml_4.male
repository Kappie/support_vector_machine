I heard about the possible one at kristen's house but I'm not really sure about what is all going on. So could someone call me or something. and please pray for me cuz I'm kinda stressed out from everything thats going on this summer like driver's training and poms. yeah it's really crazy. can't wait till it's all over with. so hope to see you guys at the next movie night whenever that is. and I love u guys so futching much.                     Love, Erica
