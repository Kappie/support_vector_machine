You people might lead more interesting lives than I do (who am I kidding? OF COURSE YOU DO!!) however, I find the accounts of other people's lives uninteresting unless I am involved.  There is an exception the rule: DANIEL REED. I love Dan Reed's Xanga. I love Dan Reed. I love his spew. I'm a sucker for smart witty guys who ignore me. http://www.xanga.com/danreed Enjoy (Cut and Paste if you have to, you lazy bastards) It will make you say "Hey, I hate that too!"  Dan Reed is full of hatred, which I find to be his most attractive quality. I need to make more hateful observations - they are so much more entertaining. So, here I go. I'll begin by listing all the tihngs I hate.  Hold on. I got a note from google.com. I'm limited to only 570 terrabytes. BLASTED!  Today, after being a lazy bastard at work, I made my travels with Luke  Laura to....where boys and girls?...that's right! WALMART. SUPERSIZED. McDonald's, too.   Bah da bop bop bah! You're getting fat!   We made goohuacamole! and marrrgarrritas! Laura got so drunk she started telling stories about this ancient mythological donut called "the dunking donut." Legend has it that this "donut" had a "handle" baked into "it" for "dunking" it into a "cup" of "coffee." Fucking loon.  Last night I went to Thirsty's, a bar for the Pittsford locals. I stood around holding a cup like a lame ass until I couldn't take it anymore. I don't see it, people. How do you guys do this year after year? So Marc and I bought some Ben  Jerry's and watched Army of Darkness in my room. Ah, the density. One of the many things I learned from Benny is that denser ice cream is better. And Benny knows about density. He is the densest person I know, and I'm completely in love. He's white, from New England, and tightly packed. Damn.  I cut my arm on Luke's screen door handle. I'm bloody. I'm watching my fat rat clean his foot. Life is good. What? No it isn't. I just like dirty rat feet.
