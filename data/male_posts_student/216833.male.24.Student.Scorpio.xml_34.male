Tonight wuornos was supposed to play a show in ft.worth.  Non of us really showed any real effort at trying to get it together.  Oh well.  I really don't have time to be in a band.  I need to just stop all this shit all together.  I feel completely overwhelmed.  I guess that is the way it is going to be.  I am sure I would just be bored if I had nothing going on.  Its a challenge for sure.    Will power could really come in hand right about now.  I feel like all I want to do is bitch, what are the things that make me feel good?  Working out, lifting weights, reading awesome books, eating good food, making art that I like, just living and doing new things.  I'm an f'ing lazy shit ass.  I know what I need to do, I just gotta do it, seems like i write about the same things.  This journal is really more of a self-disipline thing for me.  Makes me see how behind I am.   Lots to do, better get started on some of it.
