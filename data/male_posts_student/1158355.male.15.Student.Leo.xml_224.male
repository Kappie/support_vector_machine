Saturday from 8:30 to 3:50 I had NYSSMA, working and then my solo at 3:45 and then at night I went to my cousins for my cousin's birthday. We had some fun. Went to the park, played some softball, played with Katie's ferrets, Dan threw toads at the park and at night we watched Disney's sing along tapes I haven't seen since I was like 5. And we watched Blair Witch Project. That movie sucks. I'm pissed after seeing  urlLink this  and  urlLink this .  urlLink This  was good though. I'm just sick of the retarded war. It's completely pointless. And if there's a draft I'll spit on the people who think they can bark orders at me. What am I fighting for? Religion, to prove a point? What because of 911? BIG FUCKING DEAL. So two towers fall down...that happens everyday in the middle-east. And you can thank the government for making Al-Queda do that to us. And the military goes in to justify, "TO MAKE THEIR COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE" That's not the real reason why. The reason is pure revenge, don't give in to Bush's bullshit. Give me a fucking break. Things were better when Saddam was there. People and buildings weren't getting blown up everyday until we came. We're making things worse, and of course the military and govt doesn't care, they want it because of sweet revenge. So to prove a point that we're the most powerful? To represent the bald eage? The stars and stripes? George Washington? Big deal. Nationalism can suck my dick. Why can't we just live normal and stop fighting each other for power. Why can't this world live where every country is happy and equal and there doesn't have to be military. War is pointless and alot of you morons have too much of a primitive brain like the government to figure out that war is completely POINTLESS AND RETARDED! We're fighting over nothing. Ah, there isn't gonna be a draft, I mean look at the force we put against the Iraqi people in those websites. It's horrible. There will be a time in the future where kids will learn the US to be the evil empire in their textbooks. Horrible, just horrible. Drafts are the most crazy thing ever. WHAT RIGHT DOES A GROUP OF MEN, OH IM SO SORRY I FORGOT YOUR THE GOVERNMENT! YOU MUST BE THE NEXT THING TO GOD. MORONS. THE GOVERNMENT IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE, NORMAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE US. You have freedom. A right to stand against the government. Don't let the government do what they did in our past wars. Don't let them destroy our society's emotions by taking away our loved ones and ruining families. War doesn't hurt us, but it hurts Iraqi families over there also, I used to not care but after seeing these pictures it makes me think, these people are people just like us. We're killing them all, the kids, the women, the men. This world seems to be falling apart yet it has always been like this. There will never be peace on earth. Unless...machines, they're perfect. Maybe we can be perfect if we have machines. Robots. Technology to keep peace. To maintain world order.
