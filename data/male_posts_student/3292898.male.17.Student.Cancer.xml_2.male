One, me and a partner have to teach the class a lesson because Mrs. Krinhop is too much of a  lazy whore  to do it herself. Two, we have 10 hours of community service due Friday. That means I get to spend a few days after school at the Exit. I just can't get over how much I hate history...almost as much as I hate Spanish. And speaking of Spanish, Longoria has us watching everyone's favorite Spanish soap opera, Destinos, every day in class (even though we've already taken the final and AP Test.) He's such a bastard. Other than that I suppose school is bearable, but I'm still ready for summer. As Joseph so nicely put it, "It's gonna be so awesome! Sex, beer, friends...minus the sex and beer." Amen to that.    And I'll end it with a laugh:
