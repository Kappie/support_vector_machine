That is, Maxchina is our virtual home! As we all knew this, why didn't we jump at the opportunity? As we all knew this, why didn't we retain our own home? Four vanguards of Maxchina are Tiantian, dicky, Sonic and Carmen. They are just students that have common interest and hope. They have already fulfilled their first step to found Maxchina Group in a very difficult situation. Hard working made today. And I feel honored to be a member of it. However, this situation isn't what we ever expected. Maxchina was set up almost half year ago. But now, we only have about 200 registered members. What is worse, they are always NOT online! Is this what we ever expected? No! Of course not! What does MAX mean? It means MAXIMUM!!!largest, best ever! But, why can we hold on to this? As china is so large, aren't there any people wanting to build our net community, our another homeland together with us? As we can see, our systems aren't completed and not good enough. We must improve, which is what we are trying our best to do at the very moment. But how can we expand only with our little strength? How can we make Maxchina larger and larger with such few people? I have ever been to some other forums. Each of them has its strong point. But they have one in common. That is, the number of their registered members is far larger than that of us. Why? What's the reason? Do we do worse than them? Didn't we try our best? NO! So what is we lack of? Advertising! What do we need? Registered members!   www.maxchina.cn  What a simple domain name! This is what we decided after several discussions. The reason is that this domain name is easier to remember and easier for us to disseminate. Now there are many similar forums challenging us. How can we challenge others with this situation and attitude? We have our own strong points and merit. We have space and free to all sayings and words. Registered members can send off applications for their own space of a whole page. All we need are advertising and registered members, with which we can make Maxchina grow up and build up our home. Wake up! Wake up sleeping fellow-citizens! We'll never allow the good days to slide away from us. We'll never allow our homeland to be brushed aside. Friends of Maxchina, wake up! Cheer up! Only if we together determine to do it, we'll make it. The motivity of Maxchina won't exhaust. Maxchina will become more and more powerful. Maybe one day Maxchina will vanish from network because of no motivity due to the lack of registered members. But it's not today! Maybe one day Maxchina will become the trash of network because of being brushed aside due to not enough advertisement. But it's not today! Maybe one day Maxchina will become a place with good and evil people mixed up leading to close down because of not good enough management systems. But it's not today! Maybe one day Maxchina will have no money to support space leading data loss and forum breakdown. But it's not today!  Today, MaxChina needs members! Today, MaxChina needs conducting! Today, MaxChina needs managing! Today, MaxChina is our home, our family!  No matter you are a member of Maxchina or not, we salute you. Make advertisement for us no matter what you do!! And become a member!  Die for Maxchina!  Live for Maxchina!  Rebirth for Maxchina!  Do Remember! Tomorrow may not be fantastic! But fantastic tomorrow will surly come!
