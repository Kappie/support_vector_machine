(ya right!!) then we took a 30 min bus ride. after that, we walk through an underpass and we reach the beach. then we ask for direction from a fat officer who works there at the beach as a patroler. he was riding a golf cart. we ask him for direction where the mcdonalds were, which was the meeting point for the "picnic". he said it was that side (the right side). so we took his advise as we thought he ws a dedicated, honourable, and honest officer. but like always, the person that you think is the person you can trust, is the person you shouldn't trust. we walk and walk and walk all the way to the other side; but the macdonalds wasn't there!! so do you know what that means?? the officer had given the wrong directions for crying out loud!!! so we took a taxi. fork out 5 bucks and reach the mcdonalds. to our surprise, only 13 people came. 13!! 13!! only 13 freaking people came! out of 40, only 13 came!(including me and the other two guys i had came with)i shouldn't had went. but i already made a promise to the "captain" of that party. so we sat at the beach. sat on newspapers. a quater of the food had already been eaten by the early comers. what a picnic!! so there it was: the sun, the sand, the wind and the party which i don't know why on earth i had gone to! after the party, we went home. we wanted to ride a bus because it was cheap and it was the only transport home (unless you want to fork out 8 bucks for a taxi ride!!) after i reach home, i lie down my body on my bed, knowing that my misery had ended. but!!! my dad, ask me to go to this wedding wif him. i tried to find an excuse but to no avail. the wedding was at night. strange huh?? a malay wedding at night?? but it wasn't a malay wedding. as you people know, i'm an arab; a good looking male arab!!(just kidding!! But not about the male part!! just kidding about the good looking part!!) so we went there riding my dads motorcycle. reach there; ate, saw all my cousins, relatives, aunts and uncles, grand-daddies and grand-mamas!! all arabs, BUT!!! all not as good-looking like you know who!!hahaha! please ignore when i say that sort of stuff!! its the other bad but good-looking side of me trying to get out off this nice and good-looking side of me! its hard to be me! handsome, sexy, cool, macho and on and on and...aiya!! what a hard life!!! (just kidding!!) and so i spend 3 hours there, messing with my phone and my cousins. and so night went, dull and dry. dull as the word dull itself and dry as the sahara desert with hamizan doing the funky chicken dance!!( for those who don't know him, he's hot!wow!) finally! it ended with a guy giving a long speech (which till now i have know idea what he was talking about!!) then i went home; home bitter home. as bitter as it was, it was till my home! so it ended there after i watch braveheart on the tele. ( that movie rocks!! but the ending was sad!! like wanted to cry! BUT! i did not! so don't come up to me saying that i cried watching a movie showing a bunch of guys wearing skirts!)-kilts; wore by scottish men which looks like a chequred skirt- so that day ended there after i closed my eyes. so there you have it; just another day in my life. till next time...  ~Peace Out~    Crash
