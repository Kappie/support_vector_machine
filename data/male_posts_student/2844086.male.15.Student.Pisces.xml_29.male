I'm seriously embarrassed to write this.  Cadences  - OK. I think that these were OK. Don't ask me about first inversion. Terrible! On both C and G.  Hanon  - I had to practice all of them just because 7 is so hard, and I don't really feel that I'm getting anything out of practicing it hands separate.  Technic  - I didn't even practice it. I did practice my inversions, but I didn't practice "Snowmobiling".  Piano  - I didn't have this in time today, but I think I'll have it once I get to practice it again right.   Spinning Song   - I didn't practice this either. I know, I know. I should have, but I didn't.  Ok, want my excuse? :) I didn't have time to really practice today. That's truly why I didn't pummel everything. I'm a serious practicer. I do really practice, just not this week. But don't worry next week shall be different.
