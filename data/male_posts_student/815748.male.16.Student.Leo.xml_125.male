On the plus side, I've gotten all necessary signatories, and no more big tests for a while except for Le Petit Prince.  Here are some highlights from yesterday's Elite-Eight trial against Dennis Yarmouth:  Our team objected to "multiple questions," so the opposing lawyer said "I'll break it down, Your Honor."  Everyone expected her to start getting her freak on.  "This e-mail came up in Mr. E-mail's letter, didn't it?"  The lawyer who was crossing Palmer (Jake Chervinsky) was trying to get him to say that there was a correlation between the plaintiff (a musician)'s response and her sales, based on information said by the plaintiff's witnesses, but Jake wouldn't say it.  Finally, he said, "I think there's a correlation between the people testifying for Ms. Sarak."  After the trial, at the meeting, Elliott (the lawyer-coach) said, "Whether it's Brookline or Sharon, you KNOW they're gonna be working 24/7 'til Monday."  And I imagine that they walk drowsily into the courtroom, and they're slow on everything, and when the judge asks them about it, they say "We've been working on this for three days!"  In the end, the court found in favor of the plaintiff (we were defense), and the defendant was ordered to pay Jody Sarak damages in the amount of one dollar.  So we won.  The person with the role of the defendant should have gone up and handed them a dollar.  At the meeting, we were apologizing to her for having to pay such damages.  On Monday, I get to miss school for the Final Four, and if we win that, I miss school Tuesday for the state championship.
