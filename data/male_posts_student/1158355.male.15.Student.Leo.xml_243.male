Why should we let a few big record labels start sueing us and take away our musical influence?! This is bullshit. Music should be free. Anyone that thinks different can die a long painful death for being so fuckin ignorant.  Ok now that that's out of the way...let's see what I did. I forget what I did this weekend. But Monday (yesterday) all I remember is I slept at Matt's at night and today had asoftball game. We lost. Of course. The only 3 games I go to and it's against the college team, what a unprofessional recreation.Then BajaGrill and then a little tiny party atMatt's. Now I'm here, alone, depressed, worried that Augustis gonna fly by.)=
