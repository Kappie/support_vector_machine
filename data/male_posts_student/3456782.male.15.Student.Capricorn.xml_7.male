I don't really care where you went, just as long as I know you'll come back eventually. One thing though, people who put suicidal notes in their away message piss me off. Oh, or these people who think that it's acceptable to put a very personal message in a very public place like "I hate you, Griff! You're a fucking dirtbag and you should go to hell and bla bla bla PMS shit!" Or these people who make inside jokes in their away messages also get on my nerves. You check someone's info and you see "R U   GoNNa eAt ThE bUNnY? !? LOL. I krak mislf ^. gud tyms,,,, good tyms.,.,!?!" and the first thing I think is "Man, I'm embarrassed to even know this piece of sh -- I mean "person". Aside from blatantly disregarding anything she learned about punctuation, grammar, and spelling, she can't even type because those are commas, not periods. It's also not technically proper to use more than one punctuation at the end of a sentence. Also, What is up with these people who mix the caps? Not only do you waste time mixing them, you're making my life harder because I can't even read the sh -- shhhtufff (yeah, stuff) when it's like that. Sigh.   It's not like any of those idiots will ever read this so with that said, I'll break into some quick  7331 speak:  Hoo r u?! !> d0oD u sukd bgtym dat gam I ttly pwn'd u wen we wer plaeng u dnt std a chnc >| mi! !? !? I rxrz ur bxrz 2 hel,btch! ha ha, koknoker. u sux!   That was disgusting. I feel... dirty after even typing like that for 5 minutes. Sad part is that I've seen worse on bnet, much worse.  That is all.         -- Feanor
