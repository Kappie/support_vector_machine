I mean, yes, I find a lot of blonde people attractive but it wouldn't work, me with a full/peroxide blonde. I'm not a great fan of plastic people. I never even liked Playmobil.  Emailed Sam randomly last night (before you start thinking I've done it again, it was entirely amicable, and in saying that I reassure Marcus, Sam (if she hasn't checked her email) and Patrick that although it was amicable it wasn't TOO amicable, if you get my drift). She's probably the most likely to reply. Well, maybe Marx, but he's having email problems.  Got to go to this Pirates rehearsal in about an hour and a half... *waits*  Anyway, I'll repost later.  Love, Jon Roskilly
