Is He blind, or simply deluded?  Does knowledge give power, or is fallacy the only destination? The application of garbage is deeper than it seems. If a hand is outstretched, is the possibility of it being hit any larger than when it is withdrawn? Though the answer to this may seem arcane, foreign, to the mind of the animate, is it so with those who have died? Is death even the end?  Maybe the gobbledygook of the pious shall elucidate the eventual root.  “My dear people, we are already the children of God but what we are to be in the future has not yet been revealed; all we know is, that we shall be like him because we shall see him as he really is.”   Of the New Testament, John   Does he mean that we, the human race, will eventually evolve into Him or does he simply mean we will become him upon death, a final unity and conclusion? Does it really matter? Our lives, they are both static and ever flowing. Does anything past today matter? Before?  “That is not which is. The only Word is Silence. The only Meaning of that Word is not. Thoughts are false. Fatherhood is unity disguised as duality. Peace implies war. Power implies war. Harmony implies war. Victory implies war. Glory implies war. Foundation implies war. Alas! for the Kingdom wherein all these are at war.”   Of the Book of Lies  ,  Aleister Crowley
