I like to have some time to myself and take stock of life. Like when i went up the resevoir with jackman jess and katie i wasn't upset i was just thinking bout stuff that is going on in my life. Im really sorry for the blog yesterday i should know better than to post stuff like that. This BLOG needs to get back to normal and tomorrow i promise it will be :)  Tom
