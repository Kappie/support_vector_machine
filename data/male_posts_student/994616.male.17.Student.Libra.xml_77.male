Here is a bad one:  You realy need to grow up everyone nows that pcs are are bettr than macs because they are suported by more software. this is really important good software makes the computer good macs dont have and good games too wich is boring and no fun macs suck.  (in my opinion) a better one:  Macs have lots available software, also the ammount of software is not as important as the quality of the software. For example the Windows Movie Maker software is available, but that does not mean it is good or frequently used, whereas iMovie 3 on Mac is simple to use and, therefor, is more commonly used. I do agree with your point that there aren't enough games, however most of the major games do come to Mac. What I do believe makes up for this is how simple it is to use Macs, and the software that is included with Macs.   Ah yes, any chance to sell either Mac or Nintendo...
