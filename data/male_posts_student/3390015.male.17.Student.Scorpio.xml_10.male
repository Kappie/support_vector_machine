First off, the original score is classic...I always find myself whistling that one song from the movie.  Second, it is based on the book by my favorite fiction author Michael Crichton.  Read the book folks, it is really awesome.  Oh!  Almost forgot, Wayne Knight is in this movie, he plays Dennis Nedry, the computer guy who tries to steal the dinosaur embryos.  And you know what other part Wayne Knight plays, NEWMAN FROM SEINFELD!!!!  One of the greatest sitcom characters ever on the single greatest sitcom ever!! Helloooooo  Newman !  P.S. Did you catch Cheaper by the Dozen, and see the new and improved Wayne Knight...he was the chandelier fixer dude and he has lost a ton of weight, no pun intended.
