Been volunteering at the hospital. Great how I only need ten hours for the entire 10th grade. I now need -30 hours. Yay. Things have been up and down. Went to disney (almost always an up... *recalls marching in the christmas parade*).  Life is pretty... lacking... or not-as-good-as-it-could-be when Lucy (the greatest woman ever. Along with my mom and some other women that did historical stuff. Like... (which was the girl that liberated Africa from the Italians?)) disappears. However, I've been getting along with out her pretty face and keen-wit. I might as well confide that I saw this person that looked quite a bit like her. Then this guy kissed the girl who looks almost like Lucy but lacks that lovely-undertone and I nearly went up and punched him. *Random Anecdote*  And what's with FF7. Besides being the greatest RPG ever, having a great sound track, possessing a brilliant plot, featuring almost-ahead-of-it's-time effects and backrounds, and being the the greatest RPG ever... it was the greatest RPG ever? I really wasn't to bothered by the characters. I really prefer them to all this FFXII junk that is floating around. Although Cloud looks the freak'n awesome in Kingdom Hearts.  I've also been back in the knack for writing music. Did some cool stuff with guitar concerning effects. I also discovered how much you can compress a mix before even the quiet bell part at the beggining distorts your speakers. Then the overdriven part kicks in- I'll give you the distortion 101 later. Currently Working on a more orchestral/pianostral/ambient padesque..stral song. Having some fun with all my new Native Instruments (TM)...(or is it R?) and the classic Sampletank 2, which is all you need to live. OR DIE TRYING! Mahn that sounds like a cheap war movie.  Oh, almost forgot to rant:  SUMMER READING ASSIGNEMENTS!  Fun stuff.  Count of Monte Cristo  is a great book, even better when you have to write a reflection on a quote from the story every five pages you read... I've got 28/528ish. I'll be around, and I might even post something constructive someday. In the meantime... never stop dancing/prancing.
