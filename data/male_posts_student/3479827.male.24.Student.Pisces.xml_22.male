After arriving on the train at 8am, we were greeted by jinbo, his dad and a driver. We deposited our luggage in the car and headed off for breakfast. It was a buffet in a local hotel, certainly not bad- i had soup, dumplings and several vegetables. After breakfast, jinbo's dad went off to work, and the three of us were left with his driver and the car. Jinbo had decided to take us to the qian shan (the thousand mountains) the drive was long and hot. A main road was closed for repair, so we had to divert across a small, poor, dirt track village. The driver, new to this territory took a few wrong turns. But, after some helpful direction from the locals we were soon on our way. As a sidenote, the poor village really highlighted the difference in the quality of life of china's population. Shen yang is a huge sprawling metropolis (it apparently takes 2 hours to drive through it) but the small village had dirty small houses that were falling apart. While some enjoy the impressive skyscrapers, others can barely feed thier families. We arrived at qian shen after 2 1/2 hours. The moment we pulled into the car park, we were surrounded by guides trying to get us to hire them. We got out, and the driver bought the tickets and organised a guide. Qian shen is a very large mountain range (hence the thousand in its name) and the part we visited was a buddhist colony. The climb to the top was more than 1300 steps, which is not easy in the burning midday sun. Anyhow, we made it to the top and got some beautiful photos (to follow when i have access to a computer) after coming back down to ground level, we were absolutely exhausted. We'd not showered or changed our clothes since yesterday morning (there was no facility for that on the overnight train journey) i was certainly rather sticky and not nice on the nose :) after the 2 hour drive back to shen yang city, we met jinbo's parents and popped into kfc (yes, a chinese kfc- not very exciting, it's very similar to the uk but only about £1 for a meal deal!) where we had a drink and some ice cream to recover. Finally, jinbo's dad took all of us to a public bathhouse to unwind. It's a huge multistorey building, very modern and expensive looking. As we walked in, we took off our shoes, and an assistant took me up some very posh looking stairs to the changing room. The women separated off the the ladies area, and i went into the mens. Much to my suprise, the assistant opened my locker and waited. Looking around, to my horror, i had to strip completely starkers! The assistant took my smelly clothes and stacked them in our locker. Then i followed jinbo's dad into the main spa area which had about 20 middle aged bare chinese men. Once i got over the shock, it was all very relaxing and just what we needed after such a long day. I relaxed in the spa, showered, brushed my teeth and went into the sauna. ... Then pretty promptly came out again. It was my first time in a sauna and not entirely what i expected. The steam was very herbal smelling and seemed to go right through my head. The steam was so hot it was burning my eyes, but i left feeling refreshed. After drying off, we were dressed in some white cotton shirts and trousers (complete with paper underwear) finally, we proceeded to the 8th floor to eat. It was a busy buffet where you can bring raw ingredients to your table. Each person has a pot of boiling water to cook it in any combination you want. It was really very nice, and we were all tasting each others concoctions. After the meal, we changed back into our normal clothes and had a quick walk around a local park in the cool evening air. Yuqi and i were dropped off at our hotel which gives us an 11th floor view of the city, certainly not bad for £30ish. Yuqi's trying to sleep now, so i must stop tapping away on my phone. So, goodnight for now :)
