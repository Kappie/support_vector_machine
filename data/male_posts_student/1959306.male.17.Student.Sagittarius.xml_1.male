When you think of these people what words come to your mind? Resentment?.......Bitterness?.......Bile?......Warm milk? You might even think of yourself, scary!    There is at least one in every class except in my class there are two. For instance the class will get scores in the range of 13(matt meinema) to 76/77, and then there will be the girl(s) who studied. I, myself, think that these people are being selfish and vindictive. If they just would have thought of the procrastinators, the school, neh, the world would be a better place.  So I have came up with a few steps to help them!  1) Admit- the first part is to realize what you are doing to others :(  2) omit - this part is easy! Once you have a good grasp on all the pain and suffering                  you're causing, all you have to do to make it go away is not answer the hard                   questions. Therefore causing you to get an initial lower grade but in the end                    your grade will elevated to its proper status and so will everyone else's  :)  3) Commit - We want all curve breakers to realize you can change this undesirable trait.                     But it will take a lot of work! There will be days, though few and far                    between, when you feel like getting the the answer right. That is Why I                      will meet with any one who wants to rectify this situation. Here is an                     example off the top of my head. ;)     JORDAN BRAND ---------------------------------------KEILAH BROWN    I'm sure these two would do wonderfully well in making our school a better place!    Now, for us "non-curvebreakers" we need to work on encouraging these people and    helping them get through this struggle!     This is Paul Rolley Leaving you with pointless info. for you to do with as you please.
