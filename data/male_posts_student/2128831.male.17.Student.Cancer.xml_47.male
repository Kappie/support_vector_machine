Those of a sensitive disposition are advised to look away now. Dad’s fluey thing turned into a full-blown gastrointestinal episode on Monday night (or rather, the early hours of Tuesday morning) with Thai food as the cause. He hasn’t really eaten or slept properly in about a week now. Her is working a lot I feel bad and I’M REALLY SORRY that I haven’t been a very attentive nurse and he’s just been struggling on and now he does from home. I have a snot-headed cold which isn’t miserable but irritating and much worse at night, Just tossing and turning all night and waking each other up every half hour and my meds aren’t working, I guess I am to sich for them. And I have to get up at half past five. And I’M FUCKING EXHAUSTED. I can’t be bothered to do any chores around the house; I’m just sitting in bed surrounded by clothes and art and poetry stuff and random shit and getting more and more worked up. Dad and Big Mama will be up  in an hour and I’ll be in a right state by then.  And I’ll probably shout at them and they’ll think I’m being ungrateful because they cleaned the bathroom and it’s spotless. Sob!  PS I know these aren’t real problems and that there are starving children in the world, but I just feel better writing it down. Sorry, I know it’s not very entertaining. PPS A happy note to end on: I brought the toaster down and I am thrilled to be able to make toast at the touch of a button again. It’s great! Might make some now...    I've Heard It's Better On Ecstasy - Candy is addictive, right?   That's because drug overlords are actually the presidents of the confection companies, and so this would act as free and necessary advertising, since drugs are going downward in popularity and usage. Plus, it hooks the kids and virgins of ecstasy. It would be perfect. Just a few suggestions. I don't think that ANY Candy Corp. CEO would be able to turn these down. If they do, then I'll give them a candy heart that says "We're breaking up." Then they'll give me one that says "Please don't, I'll do anything you want." And then they'll be like putty in my hands...ironic that I'll be playing with their hearts on Valentine's Day.   Alas the 13th curse strikes!   My multifarious thoughts and feelings, without regard to logical argument or narrative sequence...  Damn thyne mind for a wicked web it shall weave!  Just started this book and already I'm wondering the validity of the statements made. How can a thought or idea have its own agenda using our brains to spread and stay alive? The author even proposes the idea that we may not be the free thinkers we thought we were, that idea is only a "meme", as he would call it, that has spread itself across the our brains and stored itself in books for so long that we think we have free will. If this is the case then where does an original meme come from? Does it just manifest itself out of nothing? If new memes really can manifest from nothing than how do they? A proof of this new theory could be detrimental to our society in ways we cannot know, since proof would mean we can't think for ourselves. It's good to see friends I don't see very often...er, non-roommate friends. Going to Coffee Brew Place on Sunday was a very welcome change of scenery today. Big Mama had a cold coffee and I sipped Italian soda through a straw that was obviously too long for the cup. I'm lazy though and couldn't get another straw. Talking about everything from Orthodoxy to church planting to enigmatic friendships is always the best when intermittently interrupted by the exaggeratedly loud voice of a dirty old man. It was nice to get a new perspective on things, though...and I suppose to give one.   POEMS  A desire for something so great A fulfillment that will never be reached A love so pure, yet envisions such hatred Hidden by such depth As if encased in stone A whirlwind of emotions That dare not be revealed Searching for a purpose Which could never be found Once such a success, now is drenched in failure With the utmost courage he ponders her life He hides away wondering Where’s his purpose, his meaning,  His pot of gold at the end of the rainbow? Why is everything so lost, everything so confused? Pondering his life with such risk He envisions to be perfect But fails to be anything close He strives to be the best But gives up ever so effortlessly  Well, the whole thing with Edwin is over, he is in love with his ex and I mean all is fine.  I know that Edwin will be happy with him and I will search my search anew.  So bois, I am available! I think Edwin will be happy with him, it may take breaking another boi's heart to get it though...  I really do hope that he is careful... Edwin don't get yourself hurt by him, don't for I know what it feels like, take care of yourself Edwin we are always good friends.  Cries that no one hears Tears that pierce the skin Thoughts so cold, warmth is no where Wishes of nonexistence Fears, hopes, and dreams No one knows of Screams on the inside Cries on the outside A wish that could be so easily fulfilled But fear consumes these wishes Drowned with sympathy Such terrible empathy is never felt Screams indulged in silver Released in such hatred and despise Everything's fixed the same way No matter how hard he tries  He needs this to survive He pretends everything’s okay But he's such a horrible actor he deserves no Oscar For he’s failed once again And maybe this time he'll fade away Fade away into nothing  No I am not depressed I am merely musing At this point I feel compelled to haul myself out of slothful self-indulgence and shower. I'm going to get clean, shaven and straightened before I force myself out into the snow to bank and buy then eventually return to the mountains of work that have managed to grow and multiply in my two days of lethargy. Now, To the water-closet!     Last night and the smell of too much orange juice linger in my mind. I was punch drunk and ate Mom's fruit loops. I feel bad, and have to go buy her a big new box today from the grocery store. Shameful, especially considering his much need camaraderie and commiseration offered without second thought last night. I purchased the aforementioned juice and My dad matched me nearly to the drink with his sadly mandarin favoured vodka and orange soda-tinged abominations. Ironically, the milk I poured over the sweet stolen cereal didn't suit me either. It's been, apparently, too long without dairy for me. I haven't been able to stomach the cost, and now I can't stomach the lactose. Poetic justice for my sin, I suppose. Roiling belly and rancid farts continued into the night.  The commiseration continued. We talked on subjects which became more varied and tangential as my state of intoxication blossomed. We talked about Edwin. "What a bitch," he said. I laughed and was glad, but sad for I don’t hate him we will always be friends.  Most interestingly though were our discussions about writing; my work, my plans and then his own (of which I have read nothing and knew less). Apparently Edwin's may need to search for some inspiration that might start him on the university path again. Proudly I declare that my description and discussion may help.  To Edwin and all of you listen to this : I know he has something worthwhile to share there. I told him that there's nothing wrong with having pride in your own potential -- that I do myself.  It's always comforting talking to my dad. He's a great human being, but besides, he and I can connect on virtually any subject. There's no apology (or need to give one) on those few topics where our interest or understanding don't coincide. Basically he's a good guy that I can always get along with easily.  Bonus: some of the things we discussed were amazingly interesting. Borderline inspiring. We agreed that he's better suited to write the story "Edwin" than I am because of his distance and perspective. I think that with many further discussions (though he understands her more intuitively than anyone else I know) he could do the idea justice. We made some unbelievable... breakthroughs regarding the nature of imagination and its connection to god, the unified field theory, calculus and the constant. God, it turns out, is the sum of the set of all prophets. And I don't even think I was drinking! =)  As it was, I'm glad that I didn't spend the whole night bitching about things, wait I did.  It's time to really get on with my life and future.
