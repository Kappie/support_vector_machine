It all went by so fast, as it seemed...Brings me back to the time when I just came into the Springfield band...The day when I picked up my first pair of drumsticks. Although I was aloof and over confident at that time...I slowly came to grow attached to the band and developed great respect for my superiors. Kind of like my Drum Major when he first entered the band, eh?  As the final hour went past we were there standing on the track waiting for the march in command...The last 8 minutes on that glorious field...And then we would march out again onto the track...facing the grandstand filled with thousands of people to await the results of the competition. The best Drum major award was passed, then the best Display Band award...And then I realized, that for this year...It just wasn't meant to be. Although we didn't get anything in the end...Mr Poh was very pleased with our performance; perhaps the best we've accomplished so far in these 8 months.  And little did I realize...when we were back on the grass patch outside the stadium getting ready to head on back to school...that after the next few hours the Titans would go their separate ways...Maybe we wouldn't see each other for the next two years, when the bands come together again, or maybe forever, if we were to enter alone. So many things left unfinished...so many questions left unanswered... ... ...  But this formation of the Titans has forged me into someone I knew I could never be. In the past 8 months I had learnt countless things...techniques, virtues, character. Every practice helped me in one way or another. This was no waste of time, surely. The seniors came back to help us and guide us in our quest toward the Gold, and in the end, we got it.   And this is the start of a new beginning. Almost everything will change, but the biggest change to me...will be when he leaves after 30th July. Seems to me that I won't be learning as much as I did before. Seems I won't accomplish as much as I did before...So many things... So many things...
