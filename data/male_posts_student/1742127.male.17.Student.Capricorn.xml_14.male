Yesterday I went to Hurricane Harbor. It was fun! The cheerleaders went. Tori and Amy were already in Dallas and they thought that since they were already up there we could just meet them there. So we did. At first it was cloudy and we were all regretting coming. But it cleared up and it was soooo fun! I don't know if u know what I'm talking about, but there was this wire thingy, it's like a swing, they pull you up all the way to the top of the tower thing and you pull the string and you swing way over the wave pool. It was awesome. It was the first time I had ever done that before. Definately an experience! LoL  Well, I've been looking forward to today for awhile! Mikey and I are going on a date to W.F. to eat at Red Lobster's... watch The Notebook.... then walk around the mall. It's gonna be fun fun! :):):) We had to plan it on a day that he wasn't working. And the pool is closed today and tomorrow so woohoo! :D I just hope that I'm not supposed to be working tonight. LoL  Alrighty, I'm gonna go. Adios amigo!!!! ~ChRiStIn ElAiNe
