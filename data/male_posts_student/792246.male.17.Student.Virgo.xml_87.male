This confuses me, because it says the Rachel Austin award goes to people demonstrating "academic excellence", which makes me think they sent the letter to the wrong house.  Secondly I am being honored by the school board for being gay...sort of. Unfortunately I lost the paper and don't have the date for this event. Claudia? Tristan? Somebody help please.  Lastly I have to attend Senior Showcase because...I'm not sure. I guess to make sure she doesn't give me an award in a shallow attempt to make me love her. And to see who wins for Best Costume Designer. I just can't imagine who.
