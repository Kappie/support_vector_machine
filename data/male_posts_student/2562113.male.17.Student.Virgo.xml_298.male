I can't make decisions for them but fucking christ don;t they realize im telling them because i've been through it all? No, it takes over their brain from that first fucking time and they think im trying to be a dick and get involved in their life. If anyone wants to talk then im here, i cant let myself be bothered by it and try to ddo the talking myself anymore. I'm here for anyone.
