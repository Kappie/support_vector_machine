That was a blessing for him.  He was really so bored before that he was looking forward to seeing people again.  Mainly the opposite sex of course.  But then that was quickly over and he went home and did nothing.  Well, he went to take his mom's van into the shop for some collision repair.  Then when he was driving her home on the bare freeway he was of course speeding and was going 68.  So his mom says, "you're speeding" and his response was of course, "yeah i know."  He was like, ok that's cool but why should i care...it's not like I am in trouble for doing it.  He was still getting passed by most cars anyway.  He had actually considerably toned down his normal driving just for his mom's peace of mind.  But of course that won't happen.  Then she lectured him on how he should always have gloves and a hat on cold days cuz you never know what might happen.  His response to that was, "So do you carry gloves and a hat everywhere you go during all seasons?  Cuz you never know when you might get stuck in a really cold place."  Of course not!  It seems absurd that Tyke could always be prepared for every possible scenario that could happen.  That wouldn't be fun.  It's cool when your friends have to get out of your car and push you up a snowy hill.  It's fun when you have to sleep over at a friend's house cuz you didn't prepare for snowy conditions.  It's fun when you realize that you forgot to put on your pants when you go out to meet up with some friends.  Well, the last one has never actually happened to anyone Tyke has ever known and it prolly wouldn't be fun.  Nor would there be much of a chance of someone "forgetting" to put their pants on but hey, he needed a third sentence for that last idea.  Yeah, well it better snow a good amount and get school cancelled.  Tyke has a feeling he won't be writing very long blogs for a little while.  Just cuz his life is so bland and vanilla.  Mmmm...vanilla ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream and belgian waffles and frozen yogurt and Peeps and Altoids and hot, sticky caramel and the Olsen twins...ooo how'd that last part get in there!!!
