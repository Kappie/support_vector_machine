Then I thought, whenever I play my guitar over the phone to Peter to see what he thinks, he says it adds distortion so it might not sound very nice... But then I figured, if I told them that it doesn't have that crisp sound, would it be so bad? So here I am with a post of me playing a piece of a song that I'd like everyone to take a guess at what it is (Do it in the comments). Oh, and also lemme know whether I should do this again.  NOTE: I already know I am not a very good guitarist so there's no need to rub it in that I should be switching between chords faster and more cleanly. I know that already and that's why I practice.    urlLink
