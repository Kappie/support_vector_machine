After a few unsuccessful attempts at explaining that I did not understand French, one of the other passengers translated for me. Appparently I needed to buy another fare in order to travel on the South shore; fair enough, although I think this episode caused the driver to take an instant dislike to me. I asked him to let me off at St. Charles, which is where Alex lives. Instead he let me off a block  before  St. Charles and told me it was a couple of blocks behind us. If I hadn't beeen lost in that area only a couple of days ago, I would have wasted a good deal of time wandering around aimlessly. 
  
I had an enjoyable time talking to  urlLink Izzy  Alex  for a few hours before we left for a soiree at Alex's friend Jacob's studio apartment on the island. Jacob's apt. is a very colourful place, with all manners of interesting artifacts on the walls. I met a bunch of fascinating Montrealers there and  urlLink played with this kewl sword I found  :-) It was during that time that I decided Montreal was definately more fun than TO. 
  
The night before I left, Alex, Izzy  I went out for dinner at this neat little Sushi buffet on the South shore. The proprietor explained to me the significance of that ceramic cat that seems to grace so many Asian restaurants. Apparently it is a symbol of good fortune, with each of its paws representing health  wealth, respectively.
