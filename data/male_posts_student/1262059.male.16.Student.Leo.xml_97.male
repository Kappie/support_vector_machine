Also, I was practising "First Love" on the piano a bit. It's a simplified version... doesn't sound as good as the actual song. Oh well.   Anyways, today was interesting. I lost first round. So far, I know how two of my other friends did. Aaron got knocked second round by Eric. Eric got knocked 3rd round by the same guy that beat me. Clarence made it to the finals, but don't know if he won.   Umm... as for going on Thursday, I think that I'll probably be able to go. Probably as in not 100% sure yet... my parents can change their mind very easily... oh, that reminds me. I'll probably be off messenger for the rest of the month.    Ahh... just came back home from volunteering for Spelling Bee. Quite interesting. Not that bad.    If you're wondering why I'm typing in short sentences, it's cause I'm annoyed. I'm just annoyed cause there are annoying people in the house, who can't seem to quiet down. Since there hasn't been any visitors today, and my sister is at university, I'm sure you guys are smart enough to use the process of elimination. From now on, I'll have to rely on the phone as my main source of communication. Ja   ~Chronos
