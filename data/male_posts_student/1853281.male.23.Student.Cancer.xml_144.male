Them A. swung by and we went to the smitten kitten(I love my new toy) Then to the CC club, which has changed a lot in the month or so since i was there last, the entire crowd is now metal heads and suburban prats. Strange. But someone left some glasses there, and hello new frames to me. Highlight of the evening must have been the trip to Kowalski's and subsequent picnic outside of it at midnight thirty. SO much fun. Back home afterwards to watch some of "Party Monster" and the they went home and i went to bed. This morning, nary a whiff of a hangover, how do i do it?
