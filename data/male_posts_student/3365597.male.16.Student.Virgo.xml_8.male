It was a very fun event, I was there everyday, and I was at the soulparty at Timboektoe, the place to be if you're a surfer. Rick was there too the second day and he even kitesurfed there. he was about the only one on the water with a psycho2 10m2, all the other kites didn't even stay in the air :), as you can see on the photos.
