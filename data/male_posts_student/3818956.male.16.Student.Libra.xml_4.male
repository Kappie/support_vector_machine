Along with music. And it seems like blood. I got cut once again, and this one hurt and bled like crazy.  Lets see, my day. Well, 6:00 A.M. unfortunately came once again, and I do believe I despise it more every day. I woke up and checked to see how charged my iPod was - not very. That made me unhappy, but I finally came to the conclusion that the charge doesn't register on the screen for a little while (and I have no idea why). So I listened to music all day while I built that little art desks that would supposedly piss off little kindergarten students. After I came home, I left again to have my hair cut and I must say I like it a lot better. Then came the "fun part" of the day. The Whitecaps game for my dad's company. Whoo, whatta doozie. The game was pretty boring, so once again, I listened to my music. You'd think I love music or something, wouldn't you? Oh yeah, I drank a lot of free pop and ate a lot of free food too.   Sorry my life's so boring. Maybe something exciting will happen tomorrow...
