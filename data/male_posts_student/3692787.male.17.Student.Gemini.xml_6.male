"i feel as though i've never felt anything in my life, like i've never ever been truly happy or sad at all..."  whoa... i didn't see that coming. but, at the time, i thought that there was hope for her yet, that she won't necessarily always be that annoying burst of sunshine, that maybe, just maybe, she might actually feel the same kind of pain that i have grown so accustomed to these past few years, and that it might take place sooner than i think...  anyway, that lunch did not last long enough; i would have liked to talk about some other stuffs with my former classmate. alas, she had a class at 3, so i had to take her back to ateneo (well, i couldn't just let her walk that long stretch of road back, could i?). she got off at the gym, and so did my blockmate. then, i went home and listened to audioslave while typing some stuffs. yeah...  what have i learned? i'll have to do some more waiting. i knew it then and i thought it would no longer apply in college, but it seems as though i need to wait a little longer before people start running around campus yelling "LIFE IS CRAP!!! LOVE IS JUST A LIE!!! THERE IS ONLY RAIN!!! BE THE RAIN!!! BE THE RAIN!!!" all that notwithstanding, i'm sure there is hope yet. in time, they shall all be as bitter as i am... bwahahahaha... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!! >=)  completely wrong thought of the day: in ateneo's campus, there were some signs pointing towards exits to UP and miriam. after seeing the first sign, you enter this semi-long stretch of very slightly crooked road. it wasn't that long, but the thing is, you couldn't see the part where you get out onto katipunan from the sign. anyway, i half-expected our car to enter this dark cavernous thing with spikes that rise to puncture your tires and two guards on either side of your car, whose purpose would be to pump shotgun shells/m16 bullets all over your car while shouting "TAKE THIS YOU [gross expletives that would definitely take this page's rating up a notch]!!!" then, one of them would pull this lever that opens a trap door to a furnace that quickly incenerates your car and all the corpses inside. conclusion? i watch too many movies, and too many gangster movies at that... by the way, no offense to atenistas; as you might have noticed, i'm not exactly poking fun at ateneo exactly. after all, we could have driven through any college in the world and i would think the exact same thing would happen to us. basically, it's not your fault i'm a retard, so don't act like it is... alrighty?!
