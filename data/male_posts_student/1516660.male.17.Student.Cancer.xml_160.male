I actually wrote a blog one lor, on Wednesday night. But, I accidentally closed the window. Morever, Charmed's about to start. Actually, it was't much of a lost that time la. I wrote in point form...hahaha. Yesterday leh, went out to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival with friends. More details later.  Okay, starting with Wednesday. I forgotten most of the stuff le. We had Bio and Physics, with Physics lasting till 4-something-pm that day. I made an important descision during Physics, that is to join Shuet Ling's group in celebrating the Zhong Qiu. Why? You thought I originally joined Wendy's right? Well, there are some other people joining Wendy's group which I am not familiar/comfortable with. And I bet the shy me is not gonna have fun and be KY that night. Whereas for SL's group, I know everybody there, so I can enjoy myself. So therefore, I am joining them. I told Wendy, she doens't seem to mind. I am so afraid of making her dissappointed or something. Well, I kinda promised, and it is bad to break promises. Hmm. Miss Tan was very upset that day, because the soccer boys came in late for her class playing soccer. I noticed Miss Tan was almost close to tears. And yet Eugene and Yean Seng was scolding her for naggging. I pity Miss Tan actually. Yeah. so, I tried to do the experiments seriously. Yeah. And Charmed was nice that day. It's always nice! It was so funny when the demon realises he's gonna be blown by up by Piper. "NO!!" Piper thrusts her hands and "AHH!!". HAHA!   Moving on to Thursday! It's Mid-Autumn Festival, otherwise known as Lantern Festival, or also known as Zhong Qiu Jie. It's when the Chinese celebrate the full moon with mooncakes, lanterns and candles. Well, actually, it's more on the candles part lor. This is the time when we can play candles until shuang! HaHa! We (meaning I, XC, CQ, Joyce, PeiYing, SL, Gloria and HL) planned to go Woodlands Town Garden to celebrate. Yep.  That day, there's only 2-hours of Bio. The practial is damn easy man! I managed to get 34/40 (We self-marked)! It's such a confidence booster! After Bio, me, CQ and SL went to 4/5 class to wait for XC they all. SL beat my Snake high score by achieving a 700+. Oh my!! They came out at 1.30 (XC disappeared for a while!! He went to the toilet with Benjamin!!!). After all that hoo-haa, we went to Causeway Point to eat and buy things.  At Causeway Point, we went to eat at KFC. Ayioh! I should have gone up to eat at the foodcourt you know!! Ayioh! We, a big group of us, were standing near a table to wait for the occupants to finish eating. Then, a cleaning auntie came along. She scolded us for blocking her way while she's sweeping. Whatever. Then, the occupants left. We rushed to grab the seats. Then, the auntie came and nagged and nagged at us for blocking her way and all that crap. We were like staring at each other, rolling our eyes and staring at her. Actually, she was talking in some dialect which I don't understand. I keep asking CQ what she said (and loud too). We pused some tables to join as a group...but leh, she go and push back. And keep on nagging. Okay...I got really flared up. I don't care lor. I pushed the table back. CQ stopped me and said "don't". I was very the bu shuang! I tried to push there, CQ stopped me again. She then come and nag and said something about students should not be making her life hard, she earns so little. I was like very the qi! There're no rules saying we cannot push the tables, so why can't we? I can't stand people nagging at me, at how poor my behavior is, and in some dialect which I don't understand. Total insult to me! Everybody also feels very annoyed. This, is a sure-fire method to get rid of potential customers. Ergh!  After that, we shopped around Causeway Point for water-bottles (so idiotic! listen to stupid news....kiasi!) and ham. There, at Cold Storage, I blurted out that SHE is useless (because Gloria said...there! SHE poster!, then I blurted out). Ayioh!!!! CQ was so mad at me you know! He said, "Don't talk to you for one week". What!!! Ayioh...for goodness sake! And I was quite saddened by the fact that he placed SHE on top of our friendship. Gloria told me that I should not think that everybody follow my mindset. Maybe I was wrong by insulting SHE in his face, but I say, CQ can also learn a thing or two from Gloria. Not everybody likes SHE lor and can voice their opinions one lor, and CQ have to respect that.   After the shopping, we went back to our respective homes. I am bringing XC back home. Me, XC and Gloria decided to meet at 5.15, then meeting HuiLing at 5.30. XC and I went back home. He played my computer while I bathed and made instant noodles for both of us. HaHa! That XC ar! Put all three full packets of chilli oil, chilli powder and black soy sauce. He was so hot that he gave up halfway. I forced him to finish the plate, because I hate cleaning after a dirty plate. After that, I offered him drinks. Then, we went to Gloria's flat.  Woah! By the time Gloria came down, it was pouring heavily! Me and XC shared an unbrella, but that XC ar! The wind was blowing to the West, but he held the unbrella up high. And because I was on his right side, I got the full blast of the rain! My right side of the clothes were drenched heavily! XC!!!! We went to Admiralty to meet HL and her two sisters. We then called SL. The venue was changed to SL's block's void deck. Okay with me. Joyce and PeiYing did not want to come, because it was too troublesome for them. We then travelled to Woodlands Station via MRT and took 903 to SL's house.  We met SL down her block and we waited for CQ to arrive. HL and XC started on their Physics homework while SL and Gloria went to Sheng Shiong to buy drinks, foods, candles and lanterns. I played with some candles. Then, CQ arrived. After waiting for SL for so long, we decided to go up her house to watch Holland V. Actually, HuiLing wanted to watch the part when JingJing awakes. We went up, and watched DaHua boasting about his abilities to lead. Oh please! Then, we saw the BMI commercial and decided to calculate our BMI. I was 21, CQ 25 and XC 18!! Oh my! What's more surprising is that WQ is 15! So low! Then, we found out from SL's parents that the JingJing parted has shown (we missed the ending by a mere second!). So, it means like watching the show equals to not watching the show. SL then called us down to play.  We played with candles (melted a whole lot) and firecrackers. HaHa! We set up lanterns around the bushes outside. Then, we decided to play The number game. I don't know how to explain. Just ask me in person la. I lost about 3 times. And become the person who makes out the number. I decided to use 77 (rep 7th July...me birthday!). Everybody spotted that, and tried as hard as they could not to guess the number. Second time round, I used 43, instead of 42 (my class register). Then, third time, I used 77 again! And SL managed to trick HL's sister to say 78, so HL zhonged. HaHa! We then played another game, something about police and thieves. Me and Gloria became the police....and woah! That XC very crafty! Tried to burn me ar, XC!!! So hard to catch, he is!   After playing that, we decided to clean up and go home. It was hard cleaning up. I cleared out the food and drinks, while they tried to scrape off the wax. Woah! Clean clean scarpe scrape for dunnoe how many minutes till 9.50, when all of us started going back home. Ahh...SL just go up the lift can already ar! XC go take bus to Checkpoint, CQ rushed off to meet his mother, while the rest of us take 903 back to Woodlands Interchange. Reaching the interchange, HL and her sisters take the train back home, while me and Gloria took 913 back. I reached home at around 10.20.   Today leh....I met CQ at Woodlands Interchange. He didn't talk to me. I stood besides Chun while waiting for 962 and said chirpily "YiChun zhao!". I busied myself with Streats, Discman (playing Ye Hui Mei) and Charmed book, so didn't talk also like never mind to me one. After that, while walking up to Bio Lab, I was walking in front of CQ and WQ. WQ was asking CQ something about me. CQ then called for me. I stopped. He caught up to me and said "Hello", smiled and waved. Oh good. He stopped his silly game. I asked why he want to talk to me, he said "See you so pitiful". Oh well.   Today's A-Maths and Bio went quite well. HaHa! But I must say something leh. That WQ...say don't want to talk to me....really don't want to talk leh! Not even for basic nescessities. Today, he tapped my shoulders during Maths class, pointed at some worksheets and pointed towards XiaoXi's row. He repeated that. I was so confused. I took one whole stack and gave it to Hann. He then said panickingly, "My worksheets! My worksheets!". Ha! Don't wanna talk some more lor! Then, at Causeway Point, me and CQ were talking about Practical. He was like interupting, giving CQ sweets. I raised my voice louder and louder "study practical...StudY practical...STUDY PRACTICAL!". Then, CQ said Ayiah...give KY la!". In order for me not to hear his excuses for not giving me, I said shrilled, "WO CAI BU YAO!" CQ then laughed and laughed! Ha!  Okay6....I goota go eat chilli crab le! See ya tomorrow, blog! Bye bye!
