I started my day hella early today. I was up at 9 AM.  After I went dropped off my papers at school, I went to Walmart and managed to get some food and stuff. I also got another pair of pants of pants.  In rotation right now is  Division of Laura Lee . I downloaded their  Black City  album (2002) 2 nights ago. It's pretty good.   Now for some laundry, lunch, and a nap...  ****
