I'm sorry I started the "blog fight". As Doug would say, "It's the fight of the century!" (Doug's drunken mumblings throughout the Freddy Vs. Jason movie).  Fucking International Business final tomorrow. Somebody throw away the test. PLEASE!  P.S. We all have to jump Ms. Bassani someday. It'll be fun.
