Well, my plans for today are kinda hazy. I was gonna go on a date with Mikey, but his mom decided not to let him and to make him to go Eastland. Her friend is having a birthday party. Yup...  Newayz, I am also babysitting tonight for the cutest kids at church. Which is really really good I think because I really really reallyyyyyyy need gas money! I'm down to less than 1/4 of a tank!!  I don't know when we're supposed to go up to the gym to practice for basketball and all this. Our new coach said he'd be up there like everyday, and when he isn't, his daughter would be. It ticks me off cuz they aren't up there and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm going to start going to the Wellness Center and working out up there. It'd be fun I think! :D  I go the job at Pizza Pro!! I get paid on Wednesday. I've worked 3 days now and it's pretty easy. I've only messed up once cuz I was following what Ross was doing. I'm really kinda clueless there, I really just wash the dishes. LoL Well, I'm gonna go help in the garden AGAIN. My mom's giving me a guilt trip. Adios! ~ChRiStIn
