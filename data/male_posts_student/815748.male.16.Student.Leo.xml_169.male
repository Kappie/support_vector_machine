Lately I've been following the dangling-preposition rule almost without fail.  According to her, "ive noticed actually."  By the way, sorry if the beginning of this post is a little too Stephocentric, but I fell asleep today so now I'm kind of half-asleep so my long-term memory isn't good, and so I tend to rely on what's happened recently.  She also pulled a Summer a minute ago.  For those of you who don't remember, a while ago, Summer didn't realize Seth was Jewish, even though she calls him "Cohen."  Likewise, Steph didn't realize that Jason  Sullivan  had any Irish blood in him.  I was reading  Bless Me, Ultima  for English today (that's what caused me to fall asleep), and it's partly in Spanish (I understood a little thereof, like "¡Que lastima!") and it turns out that "cuentos," the word I use to make fun of Jason's Portuguosity, is a real word.  It means "stories."  I don't know how much sense that made the way I used it.  Also: everyone start saying "yesterblock" (meaning the previous block) in your everyday conversation.  I want to make it into a word.  Yesterday was the Model UN BBBQ.  The extra "B" stands for "BYOBB."  What's that extra "B" for?  That's a typo.  It was fun; mostly I talked to Loren and froshmen, while Loren did things for which he should be internet-punched.  Over the weekend, I had planned to do all of my commentaries, and I ended up doing none.  ¡Que lastima!  And then I've been thinking about The Issue and its many, many nuances, and I haven't been able to come to any definite conclusions.  None seems both practical and positive.  A long while ago, at the end of first term, I was angry with my math grade so I argued with Mr. Stanley about why Jonny got such a perfectish score when he never paid attention and rarely did homework, and he said that participation didn't matter.  Then a few days ago, I got a warning from Ms. Richardson saying that I don't participate enough.  I'm not trying to make a point about when participation is necessary, I'm just saying that I got a bum deal.  Now, since there isn't anything else that's any of the public's business, I'll get on with the quotes and see y'all tomorrow.    I don't want to interrupt, but I do want to interrupt. --- Ms. Kranes     As for Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, they're both pretty high also. --- Michaela Yule
