All we did was see this shabby trailer house that we all knew my dad wasn't going to buy. Then when we came back, my dad bought me a 23" Sony LCD HDTV widescreen television. It was so cool. We then learned that it couldn't be wall mounted so we exchanged it for a Zenith 23" LCD HDTV Widescreen television that can be wall mounted. On Tuesday, I got really sick, probably caught it from my mom. I was worried that I was going to miss the Yankee/Boston game the next day which I was really looking forward to. Luckily I was feeling better and I was able to see the Yankees beat Boston 4-2. David Ortiz can't field a ground ball for shit. Way to help the Yanks win Dave! Today I'm playing sick so I don't have to umpire tonight. Don't really feel like doing it. I'm out for now, until next time.
