The main drumming teacher is Gordy Knudtson. Yep, the drummer from The Steve Miller Band, and he's also a pretty famous jazz drummer. He's got connections to people all over, including some guys in the band on Jay Leno, and Letterman. Plus, "Max Weinberg is a hack."  Aside from GK meaning Gordy Knudtson,does anyone remember Gene Krupa? Famous jazz drummer from the 40s or so. He drummed on "Sing, Sing, Sing". crazy...  I've been taking the bus more. Everyone should. Supporting mass-transit helps with traffic. But really, instead of building more damn roads and 24-lane highways, we should build a kick-ass lightrail system. Wouldn't it be nice to take a train into St. Paul from most anywhere? Plus, everyone needs to downsize their f*cking SUVS...drive cars more on the scale of MINIs, ok?  Anyone ever been movie-hopping? It rocks...theres enough semi-good to good movies out that I might go this weekend over to Carmike again. They won't notice you, even if you're wearing a bright blue jacket and wandering the halls looking for movies all day/afternoon/evening/night.  Movies worth seeing that I haven't seen yet(well, most anything considering I'm not paying for them all, but...): 1. Harold and Kumar go to White Castle (uh...stupid. really really stupid, but funny) 2. I, Robot (looks ok) 3. The Bourne Supremacy (looks really f*cking good) 4. The Manchurian Candidate (political thriller, I'll take it...then again, Denzel Washington plays hero again) 5. The Village (ok, so Signs wasn't scary. at all. hopefully this will fair better)  Hey, 5 movies. I sense a hopping schedule coming on...now I need someone, or someones to go with. Dylan, you're coming this time, unless, well, you know. Plus Emily, I think you might like it. Derrick, I'm not so sure you can get in by "asking for the phone". You go ahead and try it, but I won't.  Oh, and Buddy, do f*ck off. Please. I'm sick of you.
