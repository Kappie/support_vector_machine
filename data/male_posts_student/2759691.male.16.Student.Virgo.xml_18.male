Al-Jazeera expressed regret on the news, but vowed to continue their coverage of events in Iraq. The government alleged that the channel was "encouraging" attacks on Iraq by outlawed militants and also potraying a bad picture of Iraq to the rest of the world. This seems quite familiar. Actually, this is exactly what Paul Wolfowitz, the U.S. deputy defense secretary, has previously alleged. I don't see how this closing is going to do anything to stop the voilence in Iraq. As for the image of Iraq, what does the current government expect Iraq to be? The "country torn apart by war" image is going to stay with Iraq as long as the country is unstable... al-Jazeera or no al-Jazeera. But the broader question is that of freedom of speech in democracies. Maybe al-Jazeera is mistaken! Do they think they are in America where freedom of speech is exactly that--  freedom ? After all, Iraq isn't a democracy (yet) and doesn't have all the freedoms of the West. As for ordinary Iraqis who currently receive the channel, there are going to be no changes. And since al-Jazeera is a satallite channel, it can still be seen in Iraq.
