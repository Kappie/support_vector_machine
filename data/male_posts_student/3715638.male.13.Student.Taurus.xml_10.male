OK, it wasn't horrible, we got to go to the lake and swim for an hour after the acticites the "Jack" planned.  After school, I went to Mad Willies with LOD, and I saw a bunch of people I knew......from Fuller. I didn't bring any money so I was just hitting up LOD for money. Now, I kind of feel bad, but not really. This morning my mom called and she goes "Last night I got a call about what soccer team your on." I was practiclly crossing my fingers because I wanted to make 1 so badly. Then she goes..."Your on Mr. Parishs team" I was about to scream! Thats the 2 team. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, now I have to be with little 7th graders. UG. So, then she says "He's trying to plan a little get together for you guys to meet each other. And I found out a couple people on the team. Theres Fabio, Larry, and of course Jeff." JEFF? Who cares, hes in 7th. My mom thought it was going to be good because last year they had "special" uniform for the regular season. HELLO! YOU CAN'T WEAR THOSE! Oh well, maybe, if I'm lucky, Nestor made the team and I won't be alone. Phin
