The girl who never goes away signed on right as her new song came on, so I thought I'd share it. :)  "I Can't Be Your Friend"  (Rushlow)  This might come as quite a shock, but I've given it a lot of thought. This thing that's come between us can't be ignored I've taken all I can, and this is where it's gotta end, cuz I can't be your friend anymore.  And I can't be accused of not being there for you How many nights have you shown up at my door? I hope you understand that this wasn't in my plans, but I can't be your friend anymore.  And it's killin' me to know you  without havin' a chance to hold you, and all I wanna do is show you how I feel inside. Now you can run to me,  you can laugh at me,  or you can walk right out that door. But I can't be your friend anymore.  So baby now it's up to you--do I win or do I lose? Will my heart fly or like broken on the floor? Well take me as I am,  cuz I wanna be your man, but I can't be your friend anymore.  And it's killin' me to know you  without havin' a chance to hold you, and all I wanna do is show you how I feel inside. Now you can run to me,  you can laugh at me,  or you can walk right out that door. But I can't be just friends anymore. We can't be just friends anymore.  ------  Who are you, Mr. Songwriter, and how the shit did you get in my head?
