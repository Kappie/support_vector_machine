Or does it mean that I need a big ass to be served their hearty fish fry, in which case I'm sure I'd qualify. Or does it mean that I would have to be a big ass to get suckered into ordering their putrid fish fry?  It's so nice to see local merchants support with the Lenten season with such sensitivity.
