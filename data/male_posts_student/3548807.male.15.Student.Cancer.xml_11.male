Tamsen is getting really uppity about doing her little song for matt...it's quite cute."she" and i didn't talk all that much today...i don't remember if i saw her in the morning...at lunch i don't know why we didn't talk. and after school she was busy singing or something at the top of her lungs...it was funny. the only problem is that whenever she leaves to catch the bus it seems too early and it makes me swallow my heart when she leaves...meh busses are bitches. hanyways...i guess my blogs are getting shorter and shorter...tis strange. i can't believe i'm watching the federal election debate...these guys are talking out of their asses and they're like children when they interrupt eachother. gahh i'm reading her blog right now...and there's something about someone being a little bit too flirty with me...i'm trying to figure out which person that is. but i think i have an idea. i feel really bad that she feels that way about whoever it is...but i guess it's just my friendly nature.
