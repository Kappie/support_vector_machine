My name is Timothy, and I am currently in 11th grade. (Woot!) As for what I like to do, that is very very simple. I'm a complete out of this world computer geek. Pure and simple! Lately, I have been joining a lot of things that I would not normally join but I am currently saying "What the Hell!" Right? Anyway, that is all I shall share for right now. I will make another blog I guess tonight before I go to bed. That is if I remember to do so. LOL! Anyway, later!  Wolfwood
