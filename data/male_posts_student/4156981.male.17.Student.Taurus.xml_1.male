Now I just gotta get my ass into updating the website with new stuff, but Im hoping by the end of today I can put some more show info up on there.  Here is my (hopeful) plan of action today:   Go with Andrew to Appleton to get his cabs all cool.   Schedule another show at the Blue Moon   See if we cant schedule a show in Appleton too   Update the website   Workout      Thats my rockstar plan, ha.  Its just hard as hell to book out shows when you have no demo to give to a club owner.  The conversation gets pretty goofy, like,     Me:   Hey, my name is Joel from this band infinity theory...we've played a lot of places, have a lot of experience and would like to book a show at your establishment."    Owner:   Ok, well, do you have a demo?    Me:   Um, well, okay I have this old one but it sounds nothing like what we sound like now and I dont have one with our new stuff to give you because we are broke off our asses and dont have the money to go record another one...unless you know of a studio that will like finance a recording?    Owner:   Get out of my coffeehouse.      So you can see from my hypothetical situation that I just spent too much time typing that the whole thing gets pretty hairy.  Long story short, send us as much money as you can so we can record, that way you will be able to hear us play live a lot more AND you will be able to have a CD to listen to us anytime!  I know this appeals to you, so in closing,  SEND INFINITY THEORY MONEY.
