To clarify, my paternal grandfather is Jewish (from Jerusalem), Persian and Greek. My paternal grandmother is Cuban and Egyptian. My maternal grandfather is Irish, British and Indian (from India), while my grandmother is Irish.  My first name is derived from well-respected uncles: Rodney, Derek, Eric, Ricardo (Rick). The outcome of combining these names was Roderick. I am a man of many nicknames. What you know me by is determined by how you know me: Derick: family and their friends Eric, Erik, Erick: College friends, namely girls Ro: Frat bros, sports buddies Ricky: Uncle Ricardo and Aunt Geneanne  I have two middle names, Jordan and Sjimon, as well as a long Hebrew name and confirmation name.  Kalabastia is a relatively new surname, under 50 years old. It's a combination of my paternal grandparents' family names: Batista and Kalanopolous.   Put it all together and you get Roderick Jordan Sjimon Kalabastia. We do the hokey pokey and you shake it all around that's what it's all about.  Any questions?   Christmas plans: Arrive @ Sac airport 7:35am Christmas day Breakfast Christmas morning with friends, see April later, Mikel and Naejariella for dinner Flight leaves next day
