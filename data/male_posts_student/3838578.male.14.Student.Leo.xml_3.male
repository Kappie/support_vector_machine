I run and run, fast as I can.  When I stop, People tell me how fast I ran.    I ran in the marathon with these new pair of shoes.  I came in first; I was front page of the news!    So as summer came, soon it was gone.  The shoes, they left footprints as marks on the lawn.    Autumn arrived a down the leaves fell.  Winter then came at the sound of a bell.    Winter boots were the footwear that I now wore.  My nice not-so new shoes were behind the door.    So winter passed as the snow up and melted.  No more snowballs would I now be pelted.    For spring I couldn’t wait, to open that door.  And get those old shoes that I did adore.    I tried and I tried to fit them on.  I would have to hand them down to my little bro John.    So deeply I was saddened as I passed down my shoe,  But I didn’t worry, because I got more shoes, brand new.    And I smiled and smiled, filled with glee.  These new shoes the fit perfectly.    I then realized that this was a cycle,  As John passed down my shoes to baby boy Michael.
