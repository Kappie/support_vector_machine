And to tell you about how my Day went It was so F!@ked-up! Why you Ask? Because I dont know why, My day started off as usual in its own Ritualized Routine that high school has put me On. I get out of bed after Saying to myself countless times " Just Five more Minutes, Just five More minutes!" Which eventualy turn into 30? I crawl out of bed and ask myself is it an A day or B day? B day of course which is my favorite day ( Dont ask!) I quickly get ready to go  by Consuming the always Reliable Bagel and Glass of Orange Juice and then jumping into the shower, And last but not Formatable Clothes and what I HAVE to wear (Dress Code) Blue Collared dress shirt and blue jeans "Great" i think to Myself "I look like A Smurf that has grown 6 Feet?", Put Gel in my Hair Which hasnt been done for 2 years, I make Shift with the look of a Metro-Sexual and I'm of to my Nieghbors house Candace Abbney (Cancer) which i stay and Commute with them for about 10 minutes 7:30-7:40 ten minutes Before the Bus Arrives which talking to Candace and her mom Tammy (Aquarious) is always an engourement Of communication. We then get out and say our goodByes to Tam. When we Arrive at the Acadamy of Living Hell (Pendleton County High School) I cruise the Hallways and think of What a pathetic Loser I look Like!? I then remind myself that This is testing prep week and how thankful I am that Mrs.Reed the Librarian has picked me to be In Her study Group. So I head of to The Library and set myself and my stuff down. And Cruise the Halls Talking To What Little people I know. (Maybe that is my downfall As a Scorpio?) Reminding myself that I have to live with this B#$lS^ for the next 4 Years (As being A freshman Of course?) I then go back to the Library knowing that I have but only 5 Minutes and fall asleep at the table.  Amanda Wallace (Tauras) Wakes me up and Tells me it is time That I should get up and get out. So I head out to Gym (I hate The Class with A passion!) Picking my clothes up at the Locker... After Gym It is English ( Hate it 2!) But there is always Reliable Friend Shiela Hensley(Leo) we spend the class passing notes Back And forth about her and Her Boyfriend and that short dude (Tell You Later)   Eventualy Im at the Brink of Insanity and Shiela is dead And Im thinking about poking her with A stick to See if She is Still Alive? But IM saved by the bell and once again I am off to try to find out what the (Shiela and I call him the muchkin man) Hell Kieth (?) is up to by asking me these wierd questions about or should I say Like  1. K/Do you want to get out of here?     W/No? 2. K/Did you tell them yet?     W/ Wah?! and countless other questions?! Its so wierd! What does he want from me?! (Shiela says he wants my @$$ and that she thinks he is hot?) Shiela is a somewhat confusing Character to me in part Because She Appears as this sugar Coated prepy blonde girl but doesnt hang out with others like her self?! She Hangs out with me? Why? I have no Clue! Im not ugly for sure but I have never hanged out with the "IN-Crowd" plus the fact that I moved here 2 years ago (Falmouth, Kentucky) But She moved her on the same day?! Wierd Huh? By the time Lunch rolls Around like a Beheaded Banshee I Am Jumping off the walls because that how it always is I have a fast MetabiliZim~ and I am Hungry so shiela her our friend Angela and her BoyFriend Justin go to lunch and sit at the same table and thank god its Bambi (?) (Bi-Sexual!) and her friends sit by us and I freakin out! Justin yells out "Its Lesbian Tuesday!" and I say something realy loud ( I forget) and it Draws Everyones atention. Good Friend Bambi comes over and sits on my Lap and says "Hello..." and I reply " Hello,Hello, and Hello" (Think about it) and so that episode of whatever ends and I take a french fry and smere it all over my arms and im just freakin out like im a gerbil on crack! and WERE all diein From laughter and doin stupid stuff!? And then near the end of lunch The Sex Munchkin comes over and sits By me and Im thinkin "Arent you Supposed To Be sitting by your Prep School Friends?" And He starts Smiling and asking me these Questions About me like Whats Your name and What Grade are you In and stupid stuff and then I ask him Why he Asked me Those wierd questions and by then shiela is listening and he denny's it ( Not like a Jerk but just Blonde like?) Quote on Quote Like A Darbie? So I Shake hands with this Stranger that stalks me And Say good-Bye and its time to leave! The rest of the day doesnt matter ok! Tommorow I will tell you more about Me!? Goodnight...
