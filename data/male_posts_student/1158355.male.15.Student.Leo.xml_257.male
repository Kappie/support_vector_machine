And read this  "Affirmative may be justified Take from one give to another The goal is to be unified Take my hand be my brother The payment silenced the masses Sanctified by oppression Unity took a backseat Sliding further in regression One, oh one, The only way is one I feel angry I feel helpless Want to change the world ya I feel violent I feel alone Don't try and change my mind no Society blind by color Why hold down one to raise another Discrimination now on both sides Seeds of hate blossom further The world is heading for mutiny When all we want is unity We may rise and fall But in the end we meet our fate together"  - The beginnings of Creed
