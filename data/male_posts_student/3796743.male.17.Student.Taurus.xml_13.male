The only problem is that she actually has to work for her money now and she doesn't really like that. But I think the new job is good, especially cause it means mucho dinero!!!$$$ My mom had today off, so I woke up super early and we did stuff like go to the bank and post office...what a life eh? We had lunch at Appleby's, which was good, I hadn't been in there in so long! Then it was off to the airport to pick up my sister who had been in Europe for three weeks. I miss being the only child already! But its cool, I remember when I got back from my three weeks in Australia I matured so much and was a totally different person, which is good. I think she changed a lot too! That's really good, I can already tell shes much more mature, thank God! She brought presents...I got a pretty green sweatshirt from Ireland! She actually has taste...I never knew! And the girl brought more candy than you could think could fit in a suitcase...so John has a supply of British candy like you couldn't believe. But its not as special cause I went to Canada last week and spent $40 on candy there, and its pretty much the same as in England. So yep yep...I'm stocked! Tomorrow, I have to do...well nothing.   Okie...so I am a horrible person and I jacked this from somebody's away message, but it describes me to a tee right now, so I am forgiven for the theft. Here ya go...it is my life as I know it...  Alone  I am alone, so very alone  I hurt, so very bad  I am ignored, just thrown aside  I am security, for others to have  I am lonely, there is no one close, no one sees the pain  I cry, hope is gone  I am alone, and no one knows  Have a good day y'all ...
