Okay....now that we have that out of the way....I plan to offer my take on three things I've seen/heard in the past two days....DVD-Spy Game, New Release Movie-Spiderman, and NEW Music-Musiq "Juslisen"  First up Spy Game....well acted....mostly a man on a mission agains higher forces type deal....must admit I haven't seen many Robert Redford performances so I have little to judge from but he performed very well here....the plot was believable with only a few stretches of shaky logic....good direction....the DVD is loaded with special features.....not groundbreaking but good enough to keep you wanting more for 2 hours....I'd give it 3 and a half out of 5 stars.....  Now Spiderman....I want to approach this movie from two ends....firstly as a comic book geek (yes I STILL read comics)....I didn't get into Spidey as much when I was younger although I have read all of the essentials....without giving away too much of the movie I will say that it was extremely faithful to the origins stated on pulp.....of course certain liberties were taken for the benefit of 21st century moviegoers and their intellectual lazinesss but that is too be expected....the characterizations were ON POINT....everything was right to me....it was as if someone had taken the pages of Amazing Fantasy 15 (first Spidey story) and the first few story arcs of Spidey and translated them directly.....all in all it was the best conversion from comic to movie since Superman (yes even better than Batman)....  Now as a film critic....the movie did suffer a little from cheap scary moments (I mean how cliche is it to splice in a scary face and turn the volume waaaaay up to make the audience jump....you can come better than that Sam Raimi....you made Evil Dead!!!)....Other than that the complaints are few....there were no dead patches in the movie, all loose ends were tied up....as I said about Spy Games it was nothing groundbreaking but the movie was VERY entertaining....overall I would give it 4.25 stars out of 5....  Finally Musiq's latest release....now usually I go track for track with my analysis (I DO actually have a history of critiquing albums check the archives at  urlLink Club AUC....look under AUC interactive, entertainment section ....however it's early (11 AM on a saturday might as well be 7 AM on Monday)....so I will say that it was what I expected.....a very solid album....overall it's not the best album to be released this year (Ceelo Green and His Perfect Imperfections gets that title)....but it's a good buy nonetheless (if R is your thing)....  I'll probably come back and do a track for track....but peace for now....
