I find myself thinking of him all day, every hour... he's kind and nice... but he seems to have a more resolved life than the one I have. He seems more mature, more in tune with what he wants... I'm just a mess... also.. I don't want to get a broken heart..  Today I was at school... just me and a friend in the class... so we had the total attention of the teacher... All I could think about was him:  did he towed his car?...  maybe is asleep...  should I call when I get home?...  will he call me later in the day?... could I see him today even though he works tonight?... did he had a good time during our date yesterday?... am I a prospect or just a little bit more than a friend?... love or lust?... I like him... he is nice and sweet... he's dreamy... why is the teacher looking at me?... did she asked me something?... I think she did... what do I do?... what will he be doing today?... oh yeah, the teacher... mmmhhh.... should I ask for her to repeat the question?... he must be asleep... it was a weird conversation last nite... it is normal for me to feel this way after just two weeks of knowing him?... did she repeat the question?... I want to go to the bathroom... I want to see him in his uniform... I'll let him call first today... hope I'll be alone at home today to call him and spent a lot of time on the phone... man, she did repeat the question... I wanna go piss!... he's funny... he did spent a lot of money on me yesterday... I should have had some dollars... I looked cheap... he's so giving... I'm bursting...  I need to go to the bathroom... she's still looking, now what for?... Are we in the same question?... Man.. Yeah, he must be asleep...   and so and so... that's how I've been spending this last days since tuesday... oh and for those who care... a great kisser with a lot of feeling... two thumbs up...!!!
