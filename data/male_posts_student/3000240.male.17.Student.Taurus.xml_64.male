So I decided to treat you wonderful people to a piece of renaissance art, which can be magnificently viewed upon clicking the link on the "Oh there your mates!!!" part (another of Ian's random sayings encase your wondering). Thinking of Ian as well, he said he would start a Blog of his own soon which I look forward to in mesmeric anticipation.  I'm yet to find out how to do the links to interesting and wonderful links although hopefully tonight they'll be sorted (Jen  WILL  help/do that for me [Danke LOVE YOU!!! lol]).  Nehoo Been an average so so sort of day except this morning when I was having my eyes tested (6 month check up, and nothing to do with the *ahem*  mowing down of a child incident ) and discovered these amazing set of geeky old retro type of glasses (yer you know they're cool   really  ) were - wait for it - Â£120!!!!!!!! They're begged and swayed me though with they're powerful methods of persuasion (well just a cookie really) and now I await the ultimate-cool retro geek eyesight YAY.  Besides that I'm loudly annoying the townies (always one of my favorite past times with my excessively loud Metallica and my even more excessive ignorance to there complaints. Hoorah: now where's some food I'm hungry. Well must be of to Psychology soon enough so ciao for now my little one's. xBuBzx
