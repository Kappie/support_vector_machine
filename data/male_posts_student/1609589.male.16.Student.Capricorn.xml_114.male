Anyway, this one was for that Sportscenter show on ESPN, but while the show is crap, the commercials are sometimes amusing.  What happened was, there were 2 baseball players casually sitting in a house, one reading, the other one just staring at his feet. The one staring at his feet says "Ya know what's wierd?"  "What?"  "It's wierd that they call us whitesox, when we wear black socks?"  "No, it's not that wierd."  Then he said something that sounded like "But isn't it wierd that their pole is on their side of the field?(i dont know either)"  "No, that's not wierd either. You know what is wierd?"  "What?"  He points towards the window. "That."  The guy looking at his socks casually looks out the window, and you see a bunch of people in animal costumes and jester costumes dancing around a very colored maypole. He casually looks back. "Yeah, it is."  hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
