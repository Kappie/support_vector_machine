In fact, just got back from it... /me sigh... I really need to get a life...  Anyway... Instead I have decided to start random slagging of the Taiwanese "President"  (people who know me *should* know why I put in quotation marks)  A long long time ago... In a Continent far far away...  A fairly unpopular "president" was trying o get re-elected... His name was Chen Shui Bian  (don't worry if you don't think you can pronounce it, you probably won't ever need to) http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-03/25/content_317890.htm  The day before the election, he was "shot" by an unknown assassin...  Yes.. He was *that* desperate...  Anyway, that's the background story...  The joke is in a Chinese TV show I watch, its a topical discussion show where people randomly talk about current affairs.  Here's a transcript:  Man 1: Strange how after Chen Shui Bian got shot he still strutted about. Man 2: Yeah, wasn't he shot in the stomach? Man 1: yeah, he was shot in the stomach after the bullet went round his back in a circular trajectory *between* his clothes and skin. Man 2: They rushed him to hospital right? Man 1: When he was getting surgery, it looked like he was getting a circumcised Man 2: And the bullet trajectory, it looked as though before it got anywhere near him, it had to go through about 8 people  :D My 2 cents Meh...
