I will have an art feature, for all of my deviant urlLink ART , as well as an album for my "scraps" and such pictures that are not art per se. And of course I will have a blog. I hope I can somehow persuade my parents to let my buy a website (yikes), or at least keep it on reserve until I am old enough to buy it myself. Before then, I will attempt making templates again, if I remember any HTML, or maybe just commission somebody to make it for me.   I started to get uncomfortable with my  urlLink old blog , since all of my friends knew about it. It was hard to post on it and feel secure. I slowly stopped using it, because it took too much energy. Perhaps that will happen with this site too. But, I'd like to seem more professional than I really am.   I enter the world of blogger.
