I thought "Oh crap, it's over? what?" then i bet people gave me funny looks when i fell on the ground and started having seizures. after that, i was all sticky from the theater floor :(  What really bothered me was the french evil guy. French people can't be evil! Was that guy even really french? That accent of his was too annoying and garbled that i couldn't tell if it was real or not. Sometimes I wasn't even sure if he was speaking english.  Did anyone notice that when they went to france, they were still driving with the drivers seat on the left side? Only the english do that.  Rowan Atkinson was hillarious, but sometimes i was confused about how sometimes he did something really well, and sometimes he messed up badly, but somehow found a clever excuse for it.  A warning for the weak-stomached- this movie has almost as much man-ass as Jackass: The Movie did. And that's more than should ever be seen, ever(thank goodness for the miracle of movies and television!). And it was british, hairy man ass. Be advised. I say advised instead of warned because i know a couple of you out there would like to see man-ass, and though i don't know any of you(i think), you are free to do as you please with all the disgusting man-ass.  Allright, enough man-assing around! I've got to get to bed, i need to get my sleep straightened out before school starts! (oh, i see some of you are getting mad and picking up pitchforks. Did I say the secret word? Hey, watch out there, buddy! I don't like pointy obj-- OW!!! AAHHHHHH!!!!)
