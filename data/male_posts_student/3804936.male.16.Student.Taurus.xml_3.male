It just feels that way. And within my cocoon of solitude I sit and think. Think about me, think about my life. Think about what I've done wrong and every once and awhile I think about what I've done right. It's hard. People somtimes wonder why I isolate myself with games and books so often. It's because I'm afraid of ending up in that space again. When I'm reading a book or playing a game I'm somewheres else. I'm not in this world, with all it's problems and difficulties. And I get mad when interupted because it means I'm being dragged back into the real world. To tell the truth, that's a place I don't much like to be. While I'm here everything can come crashing in. The pain, the hurt.  And you wonder about me?    Life is wonderful,  Life is horrible,   -Dant
