Most of these posts are full of random thoughts, such is the way in which they come to me. So remember that, and i'll try not to be too confusing.     16 Years is a long time. Longer then people may think. After 16 years of life (or anything for that matter) your pretty much have the basics down. The teens are a time for modifying life. It happens, wether you want to or not.   Most people have trouble with it and call puberty a hard time. Some people get angry that they have to, and feel troubled and angered that they are “caged in” by life. And there are a few people who question it. It looks like im one of them.    Life is a difficult subject to tackle. People have trouble dealing with life, for they think that if they forget about it, everything will turn out fine. The fact is, life is short.     There are a lot of people that will do anything for money and I think that is sad. You only have to watch reality TV to see it. People might think that money will get you places, but if you think about it; in the end, you still die. Money is useless in heaven (or hell).    I am a very religious person, im not afraid to say it. I think people without religion are lost in their lives. They’re trying to make sense of life on their own. You can’t. Nobody can. It’s like going to a class for ancient Egyptic algebra when you’re not even graduated from primary school and not asking for help.   Some people take religion and use it to their full extent, by asking God for help and for help and receiving it. Some people take it as a placebo, and that’s ok too. As long as it helps you. The scary thing is, though, is that some people know they’re taking religion as a placebo. Doesn’t that create a conundrum?    I love conundrums. They’re what make life great. They keep us on our toes. We need them so much; otherwise we’ll stay stale and passive. That’s a bad thing. How can we keep advancing without moving?    There’re many types of people out there that want to slow life down for people. I don’t get that, and that infuriates me (but in a way, I like that). I guess they don’t know where their life is going.  BUT WHY SLOW OTHERS DOWN?  Maybe they don’t know the consequences. Then again, they’re not stupid.   Then again, they would be if they want to slow others down.   I’ve long thought about why success in life is so important for people. The hardest question for me, though, is why do I want to be successful? I want a job as a psychologist/writer/actor etc. and a family. I want a pool and a fast car but I don’t know why.    I believe in the whole “everyone is on Earth for a reason” thing. It makes much more sense that way. But life shouldn’t make sense, that’d be too easy (but I’ll get to that later). I think I am on Earth to help give people a new lease on life. That’s what I hope to do. But I’m only 16.     Well, there's my first post. I knowI went on a bit of a rant, but I hope it started your brain wheels turning, that's important!
