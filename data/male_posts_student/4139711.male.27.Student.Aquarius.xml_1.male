Of the visible church (at least those professing) there are 3 catagories and these 3 are further divided into 4 sub-catagories.  The 3 catagories are Conservative evangelical, Mainline Protestant, and Roman Catholic.  Within these are the catagories called committed, customized, ceremonial, census. Committed refers to Christian committment within church allegiance. Customized refers to Christian committment with the individual right to pick and choose their own beliefs.  Ceremonial refers to Christian identity with self-selected special occasion involvment. Census refers to Christian identity without any church involvment (they simply denote a denomination when the gov't census people roll around). Within the Conservative Evangelical camp 23% are committed, 46% customized, 19 ceremonial, and 12% census.  Within the Mainline Protestant 9% committed, 30% customized, 37% ceremonial, and 24% census.  Within the Roman Catholic 15% committed, 28% customized, 37% ceremonial, and 20% census. What this means is a very very small percentage of "Christians" are actually committed to a message that is orthodox (Jesus is God, Jesus died, Jesus rose, exclusive claims of Christ, Trinity, etc).  Also interesting to note is that the difference of 18 between ceremonial "evangelicals" and mainliners and catholics is not very much considering these groups far outweigh the Cdn "Christian" population. The most troubling of all these stats is the catagory "customized christian" having such a huge majority within evangelical circles.  We all know it, so many of our trendy, faddish evangellyfish church which are more "seeker" sensitive than doctrinally sound.  These are the people more committed to orthopraxis and pragmitism than faithfulness to the Word of God.  What is with this?  Are these people moles in the evangelical church, sent by satan to unwilling (maybe willingly) to waterdown truth?  Rise up, Oh church of God.  The world for you doth wait.  Bring in the day of brotherhood.  Rise up and make her great.... Isa 6:8 "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here am I! Send me." Will you go and be committed to Mother Church and the Word of God?  Who will go?  Who will he send?  Will it be You????
