Or do you talk instead of how you don't intend it to be a diary, but instead a place to phisically drop your brain into?  I guess I should start with this: I'm not english, I'm not american, nor am I an aussie, canuck or from any other english-speaking country. So I'll surelly be excused for the ocasional flop in my typing.  See? A good first post. Practical, serving a purpose, in this case, a warning.  That should take care of that, but I guess I'll go with the clich√© road and give a short intro to my personality. Not that you may CARE, but it should make reading the following thoughts a bit easier.  Right, I'm a 23-year old single heterosexual short blond guy from an undisclosed part of Europe. I'm a soon-to-be History student in college, already having gone through a different History course and a short stint at International Relations. My hobbies include movies, model-building and sea hunting, or whatever you call it. Big harpoon gun, wet suit, kill fishies. Harldy fair, but there you have it.  There you go. That's me in a nutshell.  Why, oh why did I choose to do this? Why create a blog? Quite frankly, because I find the idea of putting thought to word in a an accessible place quite appealing. people can even read and comment on it. Amazing what we can do nowadays...  So... the basics having been deal with, this looks like the perfect place to pause for a breath before moving on to the little bits inside my brain that may annoy and amuse people. hopefully, myself included.  When will I post here next? How should I know? Maybe I get hit by a car when I leave home tomorrow morning, and this'll never get updated.  Of course, then people reading this would simply think I'm negligent. So I'm here to tell you otherwise.  To conclude, if I don't post tomorrow, look under your hood. You just might be surprised.
