Woohoo!  The next day, I was surfing around and I noticed that I made a big mistake.  Apparently I got the wrong e-mail to avenge my in-box.I guess an apology will be in order coming up. That's my major Oops of the Day.  Last night someone wanted to be nice, I guess. He messaged me on the forum and asked if I wanted Adobe Photoshop. I said alright. He's the nicest random person you could meet on the internet.  We spent about 30 minutes on AIM downloading until my computer crashed because of a popup. Crud. I rebooted and started all over again.  We talked for about 2 hours before it was finished. I installed it and went directly to bed, giving him my eternal gratitude.  Last night I had the weirdest dream about being Spiderman, and being seen in my underwear, and that turned the whole city against me. I spoke a lot of profanities in that one, but then again, it was only my dream. I ran out of town muttering that I was unappreciated, etc., etc., and woke up.  I made a new banner and some good buttons for my site with the new Adobe Photoshop. http://gameboards101.proboards15.com if you want to check it out. It might take a while to load.
