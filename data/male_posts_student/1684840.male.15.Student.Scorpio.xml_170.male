It's basically a program which takes a picture from the webcam every X about of minutes and saves it to your Hard Drive.  Mr. Salt took over Maths again, which reminds me...  Click Here!   Muahahahaha!  You will get it if you were in the lesson where Mr. Salt explained co-ordinates... anywho, ICT Shortcourse followed and Craig got told off for not doing any work lol    I have the feeling I am being spooked, or have somehow wandered into a patch of bad luck.  The bottle of water I bought from the canteen at lunch somehow unscrewed itself (it was tightly screwed!) and made a small swimming pool for my books in my bag.  I got it mopped up and saved my books from absorbing most of the water.  At dinner time I went to Sam's house with the gang and we pranked Kerrang! with the Old Boot sound effects lol!  The DJ answered and everything, they're a great bunch.  We played 'Hello!' and he laughed.  We reckon he realised who it was but kept schtum anyway lol    Back home I decided to make the Solar System in Adobe Photoshop.  You can see it  Here .  I love drawing in Photoshop... WHAT THE!  I've just noticed that my keyboard has a euro key!  It's added itselfonto the '4' key   God I swear I'm being spooked.  This happened earlier when I was looking for my camera card reader.  I scanned the whole bedroom floor, gave up, sat on the bed, then saw it right there on my shelf, which I had scanned a number of times!  Jeezus!  Anyway I better be off I'm tired...
