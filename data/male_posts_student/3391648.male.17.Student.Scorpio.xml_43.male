However, we saw two impersonators of prinny hill people, one of whom is highly ranked in the M3r club. There was someone who called himself Goran, who looked exactly like Max K. If he hadnt been rapping and dancing (well) at the time, I would have thought it was him. Seeing how the guy sucked and was a dick, he must have been trying to bring down our reputation. There was also a girl who looked exactly like boof. But she doesnt really matter.
