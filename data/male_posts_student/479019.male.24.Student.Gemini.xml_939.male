I should eat there again before going back out east (as well as hang out with Minh-An again).   So I got gym membership at 24 hr Fitness, and went to the gym this moring at 5:30 AM. It was a weird crowd that early. Lots of older buff people (men and women in their 40s or older) wearing tight clothes.   This is the society we live in: Walmart is  sexist and  murderers  don't get convicted. Sad huh? ***
