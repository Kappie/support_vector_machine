Exun members online can interact and share ideas with eachother even during holidays. Also online meetings can be conducted. MSN etc. cannot serve this purpose asevery one then needs to know eachother's id, include them,allow them....etc.etc.etc. No complications at all, just login and if there are members online start chatting immediately. We can have username and password to control entry into the chatroom. Do comment on this idea, folks.
