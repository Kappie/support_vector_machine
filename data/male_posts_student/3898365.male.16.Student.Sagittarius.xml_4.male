Today was so icky. It got up to 90 degrees while we were out at this little shit-hole called Richardson Creek. The water wasn't moving at all so nothing was getting cleaned and all the sediment and icky stuff just sat in there, making it smell bad. And the research group that I've been assigned to for the presentation on Thursday is the longest and wettest and most complicated one. I'm with Jenny, which is neat and all, but we have to identify all the plant life around the stream and measure the volume of the water going through the stream. Today we only went to that one site, and we were outside for something like two hours. But tomorrow we have to do the same thing at two different sites. Wednesday is preparing for the presentation to the Clackamas Watershed Council, and Thursday is the presentation itself. It's gonna be a loooooong week.  But it's the last week, and I'm starting to be glad for that. I'm just so tired. It'll be incredibly nice to just go back to spending my days at home, playing video games, downloading music. I need to burn a bunch of Cds so I have a bunch of new stuff to listen to during the family reunion/camping trip. And I'll be able to spend more time with friends and not have to leave early because it's a school night for me.  Hey, speaking of school, I want to brag for a second. Gilford handed out our first progress reports, and I have a 97%. So far we've done a lot of work but we haven't turned in the majority of it. Of the stuff we've turned in, I've only missed two points. Two! On my CIM essay that I wrote last weekend, I got all fours and 20 out of 20 points. I was the only one in the class to pass CIM with that assignment. And Gilford wrote a long note on the back commending me of a job well done.  I so kick Robin's ass at arm wrestling.  I'm starting to miss Cody. Mostly because of  Anchorman . I know that if  Anchorman  came out while school was in session, him and I would have a field day quoting that masterpiece. It's too bad that I never keep in touch with my guy friends during the summer. Haven't seen Ian, haven't seen James, haven't seen... okay, that's about it. It seemed like the list would be longer when I was brainstorming about what to write.  Okay, I only have a few finishing touches to add to my CIM science inquiry, and then I can sleep. It was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.  My parents are making me drink a milkshake with this protein powder in it every night as a part of their plan to fatten me up. The protein stuff tastes really bad. Probably because my brother bought it and it's made from soy. Stupid vegan influences.
