If they should yell at anyone, they should be yelling at the fucker in front of them ordering 10 complicated drinks, while chasing 10 kids, and fumbling for change... not the people working hard on your order.  This is why when I travel, I avoid going to touristy places during touristy times.   Today at least was generally a good day. I made a good amount in tips today. The after work I wandered up and down PCH in Laguna Beach and checked out galleries and stuff. After that I picked up some art supplies so that I can keep the right side of my brain  artistic . ***
