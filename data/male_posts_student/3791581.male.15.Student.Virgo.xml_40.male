Can you believe I have been to the dentist 5x in the last month or so regarding this one darn molar! Well, I have one more appointment to put in a crown over the molar that just endured that painful route canal.  On a happier note, we celebrated Trystan’s baptism last July 4. After all the last minute preparation and anticipation of rain, the day turned out to be a great hot and sunny success. And I will email you all the pictures to prove it : ) !!!  A couple weeks ago we went up to Jamie’s Cottage for the weekend to celebrate her Annual Family Reunion. Jamie’s cottage is 2 hours away from Toronto in little wee town called Bayfield. Fun stuff, other than Darryl, JP, Trystan and I were the only other ethnic culture around ….for miles upon miles. HA!! We drove up late Friday night and left Sunday afternoon. We spent majority of the weekend relaxing and chilling. JP was soo excited to find out the cottage was on a golf course that he was awake at the crack of dawn (with the help of Trystan of course!). On Saturday afternoon we had lunch at this local burger stand… where the guys ate almost every item on the menu…and they even went back for seconds… I hate to admit this, but those chilidogs were quite tasty!! The food was soo good we picked up some grub before our long drive back to Toronto.  Last weekend, we celebrated Jamie’s birthday at a club downtown. Lucky for us the club we went to was not the Caribbana crowd we anticipated. Phew!!! However, the atmosphere is a little different now that smoking is banned from bars and nightclubs. For one to smoke in a club they either have to go on the patio or stand outside the club…(Now that’s a night of fun…hanging out in front of a club like a bunch of groupies….) On a happier note, my clothes and hair were smokeless…what a change!  As for this weekend, I intend to relax and catch up on some well-deserved RR. The past month was super busy between long hours at work and fun-filled weekends. I am in dire need of some tropical vacation!!! Anyone interested???    I   also took some time to sign up Darryl and JP to the blog… welcome!! Jamie is having technical difficulties and will probably need another invite sent to her. Do I have to hold all your hands through this process??? Geez… hahaha…. I sorry, I was just joking….  I will email all of you the pictures of my past month adventures…. Fun stuff!! Miss u all!!!
