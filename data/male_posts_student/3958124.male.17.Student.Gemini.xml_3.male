Anyway, even if this heinous thing hadn't come to my attention, I would have mentioned Noah anyway. For tonight, I have been invited to a partay (yes - AY!) at Noah's house. If you are coming bring party supplies. Last night, I went to Travis's house, watched Futurama, then went to Kevin's and watched the simple life. Paris Hilton is fiyiyine. Nicole is not-as-fiyiyine-as-Paris-Hilton-fiyiyine. I'm so jealous of that guy that Paris and Nicole are staying with. If the season ends and he is still a virgin, he should kill himself. Time to go have a ham sandwich and wish the Hilton sisters were coming to my house. Peace.
