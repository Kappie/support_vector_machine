Charla, age 27 and living in Phoenix, is "married to the man of her dreams" and is manager/co-owner of a chain of ten sportswear stores. Mirna, age 23, lives in Towson and is an attorney who graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law. The two were born only a month apart in Syria and emigrated to the United States when they were young children. Between the two of them, they speak a variety of languages, including Armenian, Turkish, French and Spanish, and have traveled extensively to foreign countries -- skills that should prove valuable during the competition.   This is my favourite team based on purely character. I think they have the brains to make it far, but their physical disadvantage will definitely bring them down. Luck, luck, luck! Go the little one! By the way... Doesn't she look pretty fast for her short legs? I mean, she was whizzing through everywhere! Again... Go the little one!
