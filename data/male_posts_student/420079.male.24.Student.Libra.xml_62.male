MBNA: "We have given your application individual attention..." Matt: "...and?" MBNA: "...and have made every attempt to approve it..." Matt: "Dammit, what are you getting at? I want it to work, you want it to work, why do you have that look on your face?" MBNA: (long pause) "After careful review, we are unable to approve your request at this time." Matt: "What! Why???" MBNA: "We have determined that your credit references have not been established for a sufficient amount of time..." Matt: "Look, I'll admit it, I don't have a lot of long term relationships. I'm unique. I'm picky. I need someone special. I thought you were special. I thought we could make beautiful music together." MBNA: (silence) Matt: "What? Is there something else?" MBNA: (pregnant pause) Matt: "I can't take this. Please tell me." MBNA: "You have a history of delinquency." Matt: (looks away) MBNA: "With your creditors." Matt: "Yes, I know! Times were rough. I had a lot of homework. So many papers, so many deadlines. Something was bound to fall through the cracks. I didn't mean it, baby. It wasn't intentional. I'm a good guy -- ask anybody." MBNA: "This decision  was  based on information obtained from  your  application..." Matt: "You used my own words against me??" MBNA: "... as well as  the credit reporting agency..." Matt: "That bitch. She hates me. Don't trust a word she says. She's fucking crazy." MBNA: (silence) Matt: "Well, is that it?" MBNA: (looks at her shoes) Matt: "There will never be anything between us?" MBNA: "If you have any additional information..." Matt: "...yes?" MBNA: "...that would allow us to reconsider our decision..." Matt: "You would reconsider?" MBNA: "...please write to us." Matt: "You don't want to talk to me." MBNA: (silence) Matt: "Well you can wait by your fucking mailbox all you want. I'm not writing to you." MBNA: (starts to walk away) Matt: "Wait, baby, wait!" MBNA: (gets in her car) Matt: "I'll write to you! I will!" MBNA: (drives away) Matt: (to himself) "Bitch."
