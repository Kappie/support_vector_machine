I spent too much money at lagoon buying my season pass and renting a locker (which i forget to get my towell and swimming suit out of before 8:00 so i couldnt get the stuff out of the locker). I went with Kensley and Amy which was tons of fun, but my passport photo looks like complete crap, im going to upload it to the website tomorrow so you guys can see exactly how dorky i look (HAT HAIR!).  I've been listening to a lot of emeinem lately because it seems to help my frustration with the people around me.. because lately i've been really struggling with people who are so enthused about trying to make my life a living.. well you know what comes next.  Line of the day: I am one of Satan's minions, but in more of a ceremonial  role
