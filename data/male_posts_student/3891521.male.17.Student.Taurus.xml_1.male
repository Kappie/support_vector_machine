"Everyone else is outside."  "I have an eleven inch penis...AROUND...think about it."  "I'm sure you do."    Friendship is fleeting.  Enjoy it while you have the chance.  Evenstraightroads meanders,  and memories are a fading dance.    "The fan is spinning."  "Yes it is."  "I want to be IN the fan!"  "Well that would be interesting"  "Do we like me?"  "We all like you."  "I can walk a straight line, on my HANDS."  "I'm sure you can."    Don't think about it now.  Think about itwith your friends.  Now you may be contented,  but we separate and meet different ends.    "Well this is fun."  "Yes it is."  "Let's do it again sometime, ya?"  "Sure thing."  "But next time I'll sit with YOU."  "Sounds like a plan."  "I am going to puke."  "I know you are."    Obsticales come and go,  but we clear hurdles in stride.  Forgiveness is all in a days work,  And in the end friendship knows no pride.    "Ow my head."  "I bet."  "What happened?"  "You played it smooth."  "Did I throw up?"  "Yeah."  "Sorry."  "No need to be."
