So naturally, there should be some discount for us special members rite.And I thought like we're gonna get 10% or 20% discount but NOOO... They dun even give us discounts! But guess wad, since I dun haf a digicam, my mum wanted 2 get one.  so we settled on this particular digicam which says its going for 649 bucks (no prizes for guessing wad it is) on the BUHLARDEE website. They're selling it for 649 outside and it even says so on the BUHLARDEE website but on the price list of the products they're selling us, it frickin says 646 and quotes the original price as 699. It even dare quotes the profit we're making!!! They're selling it for 649 OUTSIDE, WITH FREE GIFTS WORTH 300!!! Which would u choose, 646 WITHOUT free gifts (from my CCA) or 649 WITH free gifts... Dont ya think canon is FOS... Any1 hu did their research wud noe dat the canon powershot a80 is 649 bucks outside... sheeesh, buncha dumb asses
