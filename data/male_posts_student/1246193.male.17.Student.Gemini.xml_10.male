A wise man once said,"My momma said life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get." Well I guess he didn't really say it, his momma said it. So I guess it was a wise woman(as if there is any such thing).  Anyway, my belief is if you don' t like the chocolate you just pulled out and bit into because it is coconut, which is disgusting, then do what you would in real life.  Throw the nasty coconut chocolate away and pull out a new chocolate.  Maybe you will get something better, maybe not.  If you don't like what is going on in your life right now, then change it and buy some chocolate.  I like chocolate, but not the coconut.  My life isn't a coconut chocolate, but it isn't so much of a dark chocolate chocolate either.  It's more of an orange chocolate.  Which is fine with me, I like orange chocolates.  This is my wisdom.  Listen to it or don't.  Just don't complain to me.
