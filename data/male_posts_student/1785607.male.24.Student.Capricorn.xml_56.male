The conception I had about the people that are around me is changing all the time now. Is totally bizarre how could I be so blind and nice. Is totally bizarre how am I able to be nice now. How the color of some people show after the situation. Bizarre!  So what was I thinking? Still, what am I thinking? I'll insist, bizarre!
