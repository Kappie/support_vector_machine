I'm sure that if your reading my blogs then you'll definately hear about my expirences there. And I'll guess I'll leave it at that. But anyway if your reading this and really want someone to talk to then you can e-mail me @ Godsdude4life@hotmail.com  Well today I am so bored and it is not even funny. I'm really just trying to finish this song I started writing. My music teacher (who is published song writer) told me to think about a few things that I put in it. It's kind of depressing, but I love it. She told be something about making it where the "hearer" could be part of the song not just hear what I have to say. Well I think that people should hear what I have to say. But she knows best I would think. :)  Anyway for now I'll leave it at this.
