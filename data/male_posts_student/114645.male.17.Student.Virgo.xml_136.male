It doesn't signify anything anymore. There are 1200 of us now, why not make the non magnet kids wear a big pink shirt that says: "I'm to stupid to be a magnet student, I attend RHS." I like those. But yea. Lets move onto my day, shall we?  Okay, so the day starts with French. Bloody fingers was fun. We got 65 points or something like that. Then I toddle off to Aviation and take a short quiz on weather. BORING! Then Mr. Kelly puts in yet ANOTHER weather movie. When was this made? 1979. You know those bad movies you watch in science with the bad music and crappy graphics? Yea, this was it. And tomorrow we are gonna watch yet ANOTHER movie made in 1969. Why? Does it teach me aviation? NO. Moving on...  American Literature. Wonderful American Literature. We are learning about Poe and Hawthorne. Oh yea. Fun! But yea. So moving on.... HISTORY. I love history. Why? I don't know why. It is just ....cool..... I guess. lol. Then Math. Boring, as normal. Well, that was just my day.
