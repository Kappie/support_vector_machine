Since the birth of humanity people all around the world have started playing sports. Native people in South America called the “Mayans” played a game called “____” two player played volleyball with their legs. The Greeks started the Olympics, in which many participated to be the best in events such as long jump, shot-put, running, fighting and so on.      Even today we play a lot of sports. Throughout the years people have invented new sports. One of the new sports “Ultimate Frisbee” is one that has rules similar to Football, Soccer and Basketball and uses these basics.      Between Ultimate Frisbee and Football, I believe football is the best game. Not only I agree with Football being the best sport but thousands of fans of football all over the United States agree with me. Football a game of determination, strength, power, motivation and teamwork is one of the best games that exist today. Creator of the Ultimate Frisbee is a cheater because his game uses some aspects of football, soccer and basketball. The game of football is better because it is pure and hardcore.
