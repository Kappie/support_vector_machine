I got off at Stadium and went to the BC Lions offices as a guy (I think his name was Bill) had arranged to get me BC Lions  Felions posters. He brought them through and I shook his hand. He had got the Felions poster signed by Leah - a cheerleader - and gave me a Hall Of Fame BC Lions player autograph as well! That was so cool!  Walked up Robson after that and then had a Subway for lunch which was delicious! I went to Blue Water Cafe in Yaletown and had a drink with Stefan - very pleasant! He asked about Dad and told me what it was like living in Vancouver. After this I got back on the SkyTrain to Waterfront and then got on the SeaBus to Lonsdale Quay - this is well cool as it is a ferry that takes you over the water included in the travel pass!!!! Took some photos of Vancouver from there.  Then I got back on the train to Metrotown - a huge shopping district! I got a Roots bag for school, really nice and only $34.00 (13 quid!) and a Roots Canada T-Shirt. Roots is a leading brand name in Canada!  I eventually made it back to King George to meet UN. I was SO tired! AL and I had Boston Pizza when we got back - sooooo nice! :D  On Monday we went Whale Watchin which was so cool! We were really close to the Whales and it was really fun!  Tuesday golfed again with next door neighbour Pat and his son Jordan. they beat us by +1 but I had improved, especially my putting!
