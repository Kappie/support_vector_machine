I've seen enough fucking kids who think that they're cool because they shop at the thrift store and wear torn clothes and 152847 bracelets and they listen to emo and they totally rawk every Friday night. Modern "punks" are seriously no different from jocks or preps or anybody else. All these kids try to be cool by breaking stereotypes, but all they really do is switch over to the cookie cutter of oh-my-god-I-dress-so-crazy-I-must-be-uber-hardcore. Whatever. I think everybody just needs to grow up and realize that clothes really don't fucking matter at all.
