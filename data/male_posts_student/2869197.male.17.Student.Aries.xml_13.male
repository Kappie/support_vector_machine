Apparently, this is the custom among other families, but it is an extreme rarity in my nuclear family. I ended up getting some very strong hiking boots, a tank of gasoline, and looked at tents.  Youth group makes me sad. As stated, I find the last bastion of quasi-fellowship in church. But recently, I feel more aloof, less connected, as though I do not belong here. I feel like a puzzle piece sitting in the hand of the Great Puzzler staring down at the unfinished puzzle. I know I belong somewhere in that great connective collective, but where?  Thoughts have turned to prom even though it is months away. I plan to ask Emily to it. I hope I haven't asked too late. I know women like to look extremely good for these kind of special occasions. I just hope she won't feel rushed.  Mental note: Should I ever rejoin the world of multiplayer gaming, I will take on the alias "Gravefeeder." Just because.  Mental note: I use too many sentences with the subject "I". Fix that.
