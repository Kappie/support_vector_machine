Next year I need to get organised or I'll screw up big time. So, a little list of new school year resolutions...  1. Do homework at home, not in the morning at school! 2. Do homework yourself more, not just coping everyone elses'! 3. Organise work in folders, with notes separate from other work! 4. Go through previous notes every now and then to make sure you understand them!  It all sounds so simple looking back, but the reality is is that I'm here now and I've got less than a week to sort everything out, ready for my exams. Oh crap.
