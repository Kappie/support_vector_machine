AHHHH so bored. i guess i am sleeping at ryans house tonight. yeah we cut his couch up, took out all the springs, all the cushions and insulation and replaced it with a futon mattress.  I hope everyone knows this is just a post to pass the time. im so bored that im doing anything to pass the time. ryan is now playing with the springs from the couch and still talking on the phone.  la la la, yeah thats right i have college level add. its more advanced then regular add, it takes more skill and uses more brain cells. so put that where the sun dont oh look its a paperclip!
