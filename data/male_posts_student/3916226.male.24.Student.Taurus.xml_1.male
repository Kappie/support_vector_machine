And it continued to haunt me through the rest of the night....What was this reckless emotion that started to melt me...  I just realized gazing up onto the Big Screen of the Cinema Hall with the monsterous sounds blaring at me...That it's been an year now since ...someone told me .... ... Since some one gave me a ... sincethere's been any emotions .... I felt weird at that very instant... Weird in a pathetic kind of way... What was I asking for here?What did I lose? What have I gained?
