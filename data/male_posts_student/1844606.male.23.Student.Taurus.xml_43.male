Wish I was there to celebrate.  Its one of those deals where the friendship seemed more solid than it really was, and in typical slapnutz fashion, I misread it all, said things I shouldn't have said and sometime last March it got to the point where I realized it wasn't worth the time or effort to maintain it all.  But sometimes you wonder.  How things are going, what's new.  But the effort of asking overrides ego.  A year ago today I had been living in this apartment for about 2 and a half weeks.  I knew her birthday was coming up and being in the lowly position of "cute friend" was handcuffed by the possiblities of a gift.  Hours were spent in the most unmasculine of stores looking for the "perfect card."  After narrowing the choices to something non-mushy and somewhat sly, I returned home and showed my roommate the choices.  They were, in his words, decidedly weak.  Back to Hallmark I went and wound up getting something different.  But ah, what should the gift be?  I wrote a quick note, hyping my culinary abilities.  Quick isn't the best word, considering five drafts were written for a three line note.    Her birthday was upon us.  I went to a meeting after classes and called later on.  Sweat dripped from the point of my nose and hit the phone.  This time it wasn't nerves, but the heat.  I walked over to her place an hour later to drop off the card, and her "guy friend" was there.  Talking was kept at a premium.  I claimed work had to be done and made a quick exit.  I hadn't seen her in two weeks but it felt longer.  Talking on the phone was a mixed blessing of comfort combined with an ache of not seeing her.    A few days later on the phone, she talked about new jobs and new guys she was scopeing.  If I knew better, or took off my blinders, I would have seen it all.  But I didn't.  Jealousy, anxiety and a slight sense of desperation shook me.  Beer could not calm me and I found myself lying awake, having to write to get this off my chest.  The beginnings of a great letter never sent lay on the back page of a discarded notebook.  Its themes all too framiliar.  I knew I was in trouble because I now admitted I cared.  A few days later, I spoke those words that kill friendships between the sexes.  Things just haven't been the same.  She was the last great hope of the past year.  Here's to the next.
