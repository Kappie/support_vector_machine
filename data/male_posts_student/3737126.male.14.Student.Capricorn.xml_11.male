My parents: Without them, I'm not here, and besides, I do love them. 2. My sister: Yes, there are indeed times when we argue, but she is still my younger sibling and we do heve things in common. 3. (If God was a person, he goes in this list as well.) My best friends: I'll tell you my friends and tell me who I am: Rico Pascual, Jason and Aldrin Acacio, Intertas, Umali, Nobleza, Quito, Robel, Jiguli,  Panji (the 2ng year ang the alumni), EJ, Jed, Jiggy, Abel, Jules... MADAMI SILA!!!!!!!! 4. My friendly teachers: you know who you are!!!!! 5. The inspiration of my dear life: She does not know I like her, or maybe she does...  Oh God, I wish I have a female best friend, someone from my peers... What the heck, torpe pa rin ako...  Good News: 4 members of "Da Krew" will still go to Claret, namely EJ, TJ, Sol and me to cover the event for Tanglaw Better News: We get to see the Teacher's dance, sportsfest, etc, etc. Best News: KASAMA KAMI SA LUNCH!!!!!!  Well, time is out and got to log out!!!  ----RoNin
