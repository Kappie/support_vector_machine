The journey was fairly boring up to the part where we missed a roundabout turnoff and ended up on a tour of the city. We eventually got there though, and the uni is really promising.  It's in a leafy suburb of the city, with a mix of big redbrick buildings and some '60s concrete. The computer science building was only 1 year old and the facilities they had there were impressive. Accomodation was interesting - I'm now thinking of going for a self-catering flat rather than a catered hall. The union was substantial and the setting was nice. I'm fairly impressed with the uni overall, but it's staying at number three or below on my list until I've seen the other unis. Next stop; Manchester.  After the visit, we got a room at a Travelodge where we would stay the night. However, some (probably drunken) arsehole decided to do a 3 point turn at 20mph into the back of our new Mini. Then drove off. The staff caught it all on CCTV and the car was undrivable, with the back lights smashed, the bumper hanging off and possibly the fuel tank cracked. We had to go to the Police station to get a crime number and organise the recovery of the vehicle.  So most of Saturday morning was spent in the back of a recovery vehicle, chatting to the driver, who to his credit was friendly and fairly interesting. We got back at 12.45 and I was due to start work at 1pm. Thankfully, they knew I would be late and I eventually got there at 1.15. Because I had come late, I would only get paid for 4 hours' work and thus would not get a break. That bastard in the Fiesta, I'll get you! Anyway, the weather was great, so I enjoyed work more than usual and spent most of the afternoon moving trollies, baskets and people's purchases around.  Now I sit here with two or three maths papers to do by the end of the day, plus three reviews which need to be in soon. Ahh!
