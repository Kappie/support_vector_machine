I enjoy doing that alot for reasons other than fitness; I get to think about some things in my life without the distractions of ims, my cat, cell phone ringing, and whatever else may decide to annoy me.  I'm still without a "summer job"...thanks to the wonderful economy, nowhere reasonable is hiring and nobody is paying anything decent either.   I joke a lot about how my job is applying for jobs and not getting hired, but really it's sad when ya think about it.  I have a cell phone bill to pay,I need money for books and Fraternity dues at school, plus cash for food, alcohol and having a life...AHHHHHHHH... I try not to think much about it though.. Being broke and unemployed, your life becomes extremely routine..well at least mine has for the most part. Stay up real late and bullshit with people online or play video games, since theres nothing worth waking up early for.  Wake up after 11, eat, gym on mondays thursdays and saturdays...on tuesdays cut the grass and go for wings, drink on saturday at tinks cuz its cheap, you see theres not much variety.  I can't wait to get back to school...more people, more parties and more money, thanks to the fact that i'll be getting a nice refund  back from my student loans.  I guess the only fun right now and the only thing that really makes me worth anything is the fact that I have been doing tons of ZBT VP work..getting things in order for the fall semester, talking with Kevin(prez) and Todd(advisor) about this and that...it gives me purpose and something to accomplish on an almost daily basis.  I really hope though that I get some kind of paying job sometime soon..i'm going to call Price Chopper Tomorrow or tuesday to see what the fuck is up. I guess this is a good time to start enjoying simple things like the beauty of nature...music..things of that sort that most people don't have the time to really appreciate.  Last week I went to "my place" twice to just relax, clear my head and tan...it really relieved me of a TON of stress I had on my shoulders, so I think i'll be going back there as often as possible. Right now my life is in a slump..but as everyone should know by now...you always hit the very bottom before you rise back up to the top.  I'm just taking this as they come.  I'm single now and its not a bad thing, so after you read this don't bother imming me with "sorry to hear that."  The reason I don't think it's a bad thing has nothing really to do with the relationship i had or the girl, but rather its more of an acceptance thing.  How many people with significant others have you heard say that they wish they were single.  How many single people have you heard wish they had someone.  It seems with most people it's better to be anything but themselves.  I'm cool with life, NO its not easy to deal with at times, but whatever I may be, I may as well enjoy it because no matter what state my life is in, only one thing is sure:That it's temporary.  I always say that the only 2 things in life that are definite are being born and dying.  Everything in between really has no constant.  So hey..i'm single, OK.  I have my times when i think back, and miss what I had..but then I realize and comprehend that was "then" and things aren't "now" for a reason.  The best thing a person can do is just live now, and work for a better future...so thats what i'm doing.  I'm thinking of cutting back on drinking alot for awhile...I dont think its really harming my life but the carbs in beer are getting in my way...and plus, alcohol is a depressant.  If you don't believe that, think about your drunk friends that either flip out when they get drunk, fight someone when theyre drunk, or get all pissy because they cant get any when they're drunk. I don't think I will ever swear off alcohol totally though, and its not a willpower issue.  Alcohol is part of our culture, our society, Especially in Northeast PA.  I often think back on all of the crazy and insanely fun and wild things that have happened in my life and I know that I wouldnt have this many memories if it wasn't for alcohol being involved.  Ironically...volch's birthday bash is Saturday Night at my house..I think i'm going to be all responsible and sober maybe a DD or something...just because I can.   I can't believe how quickly time has passed...but then again, why is it that events that happened last year seemed to have happened years and years ago? Weird.  Volch is turning 23 in a few days..its crazy..I remember when he turned 21 and we took him out...thats a whole other journal entry in itself.   I'm already going to be 24..i think it might just be about time to finish up with school.  First..i think i may have to because i dont know how much longer pheaa is going to give me money and Secondly, i'm older than alot of the people there, age wise.  Then Wisdom wise..people tell me i'm wise beyond my years and all that.. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE COLLEGE...call me Van Wilder..really..but I'm around alot of people with high school kid mentalities..people who aren't exactly adults yet mentally, and I find it really hard to relate, especially to the girls..their goals conflict with their attitudes.  Try to find a girl thats 18 or 19 thats ready to start thinking about having a future with a guy, and knows how to be a respectable girlfirend, really..try to find one..you'll see what i mean.  My run may just about be over...I don't know..in one aspect..yeah, I want to get out and make tons of cash, but at the same time...i'm not sick of the partying and I feel like I can do a lot for my fraternity if I put off graduating. Ahh choices choices.  I wonder if anyone is going to remember its my birthday this year.  I guess this comes from the same School of thought as wondering who would be at your funeral if you died.  I dont parallel these 2 thoughts at all being that only a handful of people last year said "happy birthday"..i KNOW a TON more people would be at my funeral whenever it is that I kick(NOW DONT TAKE THAT WRONG..i'm not saying i want to die or that i am dying anytime soon).  I don't really know why it is that it pisses me off so much that people dont know its my birthday.  I think its the whole bitter thing..where I do so much for people then feel like i dont get back enough, or that people somehow owe me at least a happy birthday or something..I don't know.  Maybe it has to do with  that fear inside of me that drives me..the fear of being forgotten or not being appreciated or even known for anything during my life and when I die.  I have this thing inside of me that I want to mean something to the world..I want to make a difference for someone..anyone..somewhere...everywhere....I want to leave my mark in this world when i'm gone...No idea how or when or even why i'm driven by this, but I am.  Somewhere along with this facet of my personality is an "idealist streak"...i spend so much time talking about how things should be and how i want them to change for, what i see as the better.  Add this all up and multiply it by the fact that i'm strong willed and a sure leader.  Thats one big equation..whats the result? Me.  I'd rather people love me than hate me, but some people dont like leaders, rules, and following..some people dont make sense and know no reason....I suppose this is why I have  a hard time understanding alot of people in the world..and society and things.  I don't really know where I was going when i started this journal post, and I'm not sure where i really ended up, but This is the wonder of this journal..and my mind. Until I write again. Peace, Love, and that other thing.  80s song you should have:18 and Life by Skid Row 90s song you should have:Can a nigga get a table dance by 2 Live Crew Movie song you should have:Any song sung by the Steel Dragons from the Movie Rock Star Current Hit you should have: Boys of summer by the Ataris Current Hit you shouldn't have: anything by 50 Cent An REM song:Man on the Moon A song you've never heard of: Temptation by Delerium
