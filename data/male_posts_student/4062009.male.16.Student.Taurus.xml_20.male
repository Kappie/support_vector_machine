For those who missed today's meeting. I will give you the best summary about what Film Club is all about that I possibly can.  Well Film Club is pretty much what it sounds like. Only difference is that we don't make movies in the club, though you are highly welcome too and you can bring them in for us to watch. What we mainly do is sit around in the class room and watch movies while we eat pizza or whatever that we can get. Yet we do do more then just watch movies. We also hold a Film Festival about every year, from what I know of, to which people can watch movies, get refreshments, and whatever else there is to do there. And one time, last year, we even had movie under the stars where people could come and eat dinner while watching a movie at the school.  For the most part, we do a lot of things that involve movies and films. For more detailed info about the club, then just contact Nicholson at Milton. She can fill you in on your questions a lot better then I can. LOL!  Well, see ya!     Tim
