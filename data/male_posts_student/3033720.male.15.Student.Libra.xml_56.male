She was really nice, and I just felt I could really relate to her personality and sense of humor, not to mention that she was drop dead gorgeous. Anyways, Ponder and I went to the movies, and 'twas great fun. Although he sorta looked alone....oh well...Anyway, I hope to get to know this special person a little better. It's really a relief to meet someone like that. I guess thats it for now...I think I might have a good summer to look forward to after all. And Sarah, if you read this, I'm really sorry I made you upset. That's all for now, but I will post something else later. I still need someone to do another audio post with.
