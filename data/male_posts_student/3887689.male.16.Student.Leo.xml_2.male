I. Minor thing first. My mom gave me her old MP3 player, and it's totally sweet. It holds 10 gigs, which is about 3,000 songs or so. Trying to figure out how the hell it works with no manual was tough, but me being the genius that I am, I did it in about a week. I'm uploading my Bjork albums to it as we speak. Having my entire album collection all in a box about the size of a camera totally kicks ass.  II. My friend Khalina lost her virginity yesterday. It kind of shocked me. You know how parents are always talking about how their kids grow up so fast? I feel the same way towards my friends. It seems only yesterday when me and my friends first learned the meaning of the word "clitoris". Now they're smoking, drinking, fucking. Sometimes I pine for the days of innocence, the days when I found fart jokes amusing. But then I realize that those days...kinda sucked, regardless of what people try to tell you. Your parents never let you do anything, you had to go to bed early, you enjoyed Barney. Yep, don't let anyone tell you that childhood is the best time of your life.  To Khalina: you're my best buddy, and may you enjoy many more fucks in the future.
