Now personally i could sit through 4 or 5, but not 10 or 15... I pretty much have them memorized.  All i have to say is, wouldn't it suck to be "Ensign BOB"? The caption would say "Ok, for this away mission, I'll need First officer Spock, Doctor McCoy, and Ensign Bob..." Right about this point, you know you’re going to die, so what’s the point. I'm rather surprised that there are so many Senor Officers with the death rate among Ensigns; they never have a chance to be promoted. Now, if there are around 300 people on board the ship, and around 100 of those are Ensigns, There are about 100 episodes and half of them feature an away mission, that’s about 50 Ensign Bobs. So now that’s about a 50% chance of being The Ensign Bob who just got eaten by the mutant giant (bad pun ahead warning!) from planet Ure, in the solar system Scrude. So personally, if your name is Bob, or Jack, or Johnson, I would get out of that red uniform pretty quick like.  *Playing with phaser...* Have you ever noticed that when there is a fire fight on a ship, no one shoots a hole in the window or wall? And who would be stupid enough to put an OVERLOAD button on a phaser. And now, how fast is "Ramming SPEED! Lieutenant Sulu!" And would you put a setting on a ship for it? I wonder how long it was sitting in Committee before they actually decided on a good speed for ramming a ship. I would have loved to be the person who had to test it... Ramming Ships into brick walls... ahh the good old days.  And one last thing, why do the planets look red and green and purple in space, but there normal on the ground... anyway *hops in time machine with a replicator and a few phasers* I'll be heading back to my own time now, and if you want a phaser.. Just call me!  Later... :P
