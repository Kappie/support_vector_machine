Anyway, what ended up happening was that I hung out with a bunch of cool people around the belmont/halsted area.  Lots of fun.  Much cool stuff and cool people.  Particularly cool was this guy named Alex.  Really nice guy, funny.  Flamboyant, but not ridiculously so.  Talked a lot.  Vaguely cute.  Cool accent.  (He has a boyfriend.)  Anyway, that was fun.  Definitely going back.  Chip should be home within a couple hours.  -Mike  "Leave it on the back burner, take it to the drytown, yea, here we go."
