I had to redraw the schedule this week - it was a bloody chore - consider I'd already done it once. Rob keeps attempting to console me with the fact that the Glennis will probably be gone within the next month - we both know that's a lie. He can't even manage a home theatre department, let alone several other chores beside that. He has no work ethic to speak of. We have AORs - Areas of Responsibility. Tag, dust shit, make sure it looks good. For his entire tour of duty in Home Theatre he wouldn't dust (I'd write "Dust me" on the screens), his plasma wall was broken and things were generally fucked up. A real shame. Now that he's back in comm, things are bad - we've got serious staffing issues. Essentially we have five full timers in a department that could run on three.  In good news I've been assigned dual captaincy with Open Box and clearance. How I juggle these two tasks will be the benchmark by which I'm compared in the future. You wanna shoot high, but not so high that you hang yourself. It's a delicate balance.  I talked to Harold about working at Rogers yesterday. That could be appealing. At the very least a steady paycheck would be nice.  I'm looking pretty trim on this Atkin's thing, however I've got a holdover from when I was sick. I think I'm going to go back to the doctor and talk to her about it - my stomach hurts quite a bit almost immediately after I eat. Maybe it's the cancer.  Yesterday was April fools, I didn't get fooled at all. Pity.  Jeff has announced that he will be joining us here next week in an impromptu visit. That is very exciting and unexpected. There shall be much rejoicing.  Movie theatres are phasing out cheap night. My propensity for downloading films just shot through the roof. Fuck me, I fuck you right back. IN THE EYE.  That's all for now.
