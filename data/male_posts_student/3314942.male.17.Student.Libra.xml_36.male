When you listen to music your listening to an auditory art form. Just like art today, its not meant just to be pretty. within the skillfully crafted rhythym, and the oh-so-carefully worded lyrics lies something more sinister. First, i have to distinguish something. There is music, and then there is commercial music. Music examples are Franz Ferdinand, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, Charlie Parker, Bach, Debussy, and Beethoven. Commercial music is not crafted, it is designed for the sole purpose of making money. Everybody inevitably says "isnt that the point for all musicians these days?" The answer is no. The musicians mentioned above each had a desire to communicate through song, and to help relate a common cause or theory. Commercial musicians, i.e. MTV spewed crap, were designed not necessarily to communicate, but to fuel the money making machine; this is not to say that it doesnt sound pleasant, but there is simply no substance. Now, i sound like a total asshole/snob/pretentious erodite fuck by saying that, but its really what i believe. now i have cleared that up i return to my original topic of mixes. A mix is a carefully crafted playlist of songs. Each mix, in my view, has a "soul" to it. You cant just throw together any random songs, that would just be shuffling your fuckin music library. A mix conveys much much more. There are simply good music mixes which are meant to have nothing but good music on them, and those are important too; because, in the end its good music. But a crafted mix composed of meaningful and carefully picked songs has the ability, just like the songs, to convey something more to the listener. You can tell a story, you can create an emotional rollercoaster, you can create a soothing prozac mix, you can create a mix which bursts forth with mounds of energy which just makes you want to sing at the top of your lungs. Mixes, in the end become an art form. Just like Van Gogh's "Starry Night", you can create the feeling of that cool blue star-lit city with the perfect set of songs.  Many people ask why i confront a mix with same ferocity and dedication as i would with a piece of my art, and i give them the same reason i give with my art, "because i care".   songs are my paint, and mixes are my canvases  this is why its an honor to receive a perfectly crafted mix from anyone. Your not just getting a cd which might be nice to listen to; your getting a little window into that person, and your getting a piece of audible art.
