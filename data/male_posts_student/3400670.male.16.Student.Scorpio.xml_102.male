I don't feel that abortion is a legitimate way of escaping the problems of unexpected pregnancy. The woman should have thought about the consequences of potential pregnancy before she decided to have sex. I know I know, but what about the women who get raped. That solution would be solved by adoption. I have heard from some people that adoption isn't a sucessful option. What I have to say to that is where's your proof? With the process of adoption, the baby, at birth, is signed over to a family or a couple. It's not like the baby is being handed over to the state. It's the state that has the problems of foster care, or the problems people may think of when they hear of adoption as a solution. But anyways, should the government keep abortion legalized? I'm against abortion, but the to tell you the truth, the government should have no say as to what women do with their bodies. Abortion is a moral problem, not a legal problem. To say something else about abortion, especially the clinics. I wish that abortion clinics would give more information about the procedure. Abortion is not simply taking a piece of tissue out of a woman's body. Abortion is taking a life away, and no one can argue that it's not.
