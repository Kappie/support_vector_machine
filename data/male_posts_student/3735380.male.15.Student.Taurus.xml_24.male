Here's the story.  My brother's birthday was today. I'm lucky he didn't bug me all day. You know how birthday-boys are.  Anyway I overheard a conversation when I was getting a snack in between editing images. My brother wanted to play Monopoly indoors, but my dad wanted to play baseball outside. He promised to play Monopoly tonight.  Well, it appears that he was ticked. I walked upstairs and continued editing and creating images for peoples profiles. Hey, I was addicted to photoshop!  The family went to dinner, we ate, got stuffed, and nobody could finish the last morsel on the last item of the meal.  When we got home, I came upstairs but was quickly called downstairs for the birthday present openings. Well, Dad and Mom were not pleased when they found the garage door hinge halfway in, halfway out. Kicked stuck.  My dad knew the culprit. Birthday boy it was. However he said "It wasnt me", which implied directly that it was me. Allow me to explain.  My mom and dad would never do a thing like that to the door. My other little brother just was't strong enough. Yes, that meant he implied the blame directly on me. The only people who truly knew were Dad, my brother, and me. My dad refused to talk, knowing that my brother was in deep trouble for lying, and nobody else believed my defense.  Now this loss of credibility in front of your parents is devastating for anyone. When around parents, you need to be a good little angel in their eyes, so when you make mistakes, they'll trust you. My little brother, one year older, has less privileges now.  He sat down at the table and cried. I almost felt sorry for him, but with the pain he gave me within the last year, I just walked away apathetic. It was his decision, and he made the wrong one. To make the situation worse, it was in front of his parentsâ€”the worst nightmares of his next 5 years living in this house.  When I was in my room, about 30 minutes later, my mom came up and asked me to join in a game of Monopoly. That fool has been hostile toward me all year, he tried to rub the blame off onto me after ruining the door, and now he wants me to play Monopoly? I said forget it, along with the sentence above.  Part II: War on Kerry  I stayed in my room. Then I met some nice republican dude. We came up with the idea of a new comic strip. Yep, you guessed it. War on Kerry. I'd post this on proboards support forum but it will get me banned because the admins on there are all Liberal. Below I'll show the first three images I've made so far.   Warning  These comics are very Republican and may offend you. Read at your own risk.  Please understand I am not responsible for any injuries resulting from the high amount of laughter you will experience from this. My suggestion: do not read with food in your mouth, or if you're in a dangerous position.
