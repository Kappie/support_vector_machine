But what people need to do is put it within a context of war.  The prisoners were war criminals.  They were imprisoned for trying to kill American soldiers or American civilians!  They were bad people!  All of the sudden people are realizing that we use certain interrogation on these bad people for them to give us information on other bad people.  Let me tell you, we have been doing this for many years.  It was probably much worse during the Cold War.  It seems to me a bit naive of some people to be shocked and disgusted about this.  This is war.  Someone said to me the other day, "All is fair in love and war".  While it is a cliche, it holds true.  If one of these prisoners can help stop further attacks on our troops, then our soldiers should be able to use any means necessary to get this information.  Imagine if on 9/10/2001, we had captured someone who might have had information on what would occur the next day.  Wouldn't intense interrogation methods be warranted?  Wouldn't it seem necessary?    War is war.  The Iraqis never played by the rules when they pretended to surrender, then shot our soldiers.  They never apologized for any of their atrocities.  Then you have these jerks on the cable news shows talking about violations of the Geneva Convention.  WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY THAT FOLLOWS IT (modified: the only country with an active military.)  Not even the self-righteous French who scripted most of the rules follow it with active prison camps in South America and islands in the Mediterreanian.    It is all just plain politics during an election year.  Bush gave an apology, which I would have never have done.  Now all these people need to just be quiet.
