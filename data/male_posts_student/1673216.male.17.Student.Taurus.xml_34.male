       
      Do you ever wish a bird from above would fly down and save you from the sorrow of life  do you ever ponder what a savior would be like to lift your spirit, mind, and soul  does the thought ever pass that dreams just might seem slightly more real then the waking hours  here at the beginning of all things the end of all things  do you ever wish you could have your own savior
