"Michael, take the dog for a walk"  Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! This is crazy. You can't expect me to do everything. It's summer. Time to relax. Imperative sentences are supposed to be gone, along with school.  I already have a job. I get paid. It's not my fault that I requested hours and didn't get any.  And what am I getting paid for these chores? $0.00 a year.  That 's gonna buy me a car. When I did a cruddy job on sweeping the driveway, I yelled back to my dad, "You get what you pay for", and that got him. I still had to sweep the rest anyway.  "But it's simple." Then do it yourself.  All I ever wanted to do today was sit and play Golden Sun on my GameBoy. I managed to play about 4 hours of it, and 1 hour of reattempting failed sidequests. But that was for the entire time of today. The other 5 hours I was forced to do something else.  It was a long morning too. My brother yanked the covers off me to wake me up at 11:00. That got me in a great mood to beat him up this morning.  Basically, I was ticked the entire day. In the game, I was stuck against Saturos on the Mercury Lighthouse aerie. That's when the batteries ran out.  So what happened that actually went right today? Let's recap for a minute. 1. I'm still alive.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Let's wait and see.
