In anycase, I think shall be asking Jeanie (probably the most visited site belonging to the queen (okay okay jeanie, queen does sound old!) princess of 2H, to advertise my blog. Then we'll see what happens. Question for thinkers and dreamers: What kind of people visit blogs anyway?  Oh so sad cassandra, don't worry I'll always be there to argue with you. That way you won't fall asleep in class hehe! And yeah, in case you haven't noticed, I HAVE been talking to you you know? Albeit it may be in the form of arguing. By the way, you were saying something about an expressions voucher?...  It's my first time (blog virginity?) making a blog so maybe there will be lots of things to say. And really I have no idea how to handle this stuff. The last time I made a site was primary school and believe me when I say I was good.. At that time. Now I forgot everything there is to know, but as long as this words get published, Honestly! Who needs music and pretty icons?  I'll have to be careful with what I say... Jeanie seems to handle okay though, maybe it's because it's all "Ooooh! I got this Newee Pinky baggy! Oooh! and look, I also got this newee pinky skirt! And Look and Meeee and Hubbee!! Love him to bits!! Oooh!"  Haha, I didn't say anything about her directly, so don't put words into my mouth. Besides, Jeanie is part of my microscopic list of true friends to, so I don't think she'll mind.  Speaking of which, I know the answer but is it possible to inflict this anti-social behaviour on Cassandra so she'll literally be happy that people ARE leaving her alone? Okay I promise this will be the last time I'm talking about her; scared  kena  get whacked by her on wednesday.  To those people who are out to bring me down in the politcal race in the class of 2H, it's alright if you choose to find ways and means to search for things that I said wrongly and exploit it. I survived many of these sort of things. Oh and feel free to mock me if you find any bad English, I didn't realize that what I say have to be  scrutinized (cheem  enough?) all the time.  Right, so things end here. Meanwhile I'll be learning more about this blog machine thang and I'll just be living life. Conte Partero.
