Kane then pulled out a pair of jumper cables and a car battery.  Kane attached the jumper cables to the Shane-O-Nuts, and zapped him off of the battery.   My first thought was,  "How shocking!"   Then I realized my brain was punning me....  The segment was saved by RVD running in to make the save and beating the crap out of Kane.  Thank gawd.  It was almost about to become one of the dumbest things I have ever witnessed as a pro wrestling fan.   What are some of the dumbest moments you've ever witnessed as a pro wrestling fan, Drewcifer?   Why thanks for asking!  There was, of couse, David Arqutte's run as WCW World Champion (which was the final nail in WCW's coffin, ask anyone), but WCW doesn't count here.  I remember a few years back when the Hardcore Title, and hardcore wrestling was a big deal in the Fed (whenever I refer to "the Fed", I mean pre-lawsuit-change-WWF-to-WWE days).  Anyway, Al Snow was the Hardcore Champ, and was feuding with The Big Bossman.  At the time, Snow had lost his "Head", so instead he was coming to the ring with his chiahuahua.  Then the doggie vanished.  So Bossman takes Snow out on a quest to find his dog.   Over the course of a couple weeks, Bossman decides to serve Al some homecooked beef stew.  As Al was chowing down on a dish that he was selling as MY-T-TASTY, Bossman reveals that Snow was eating his own doggie.  DUMB!  Speaking of Bossman...somewhere after that, he was feuding with The Big Show.  Show's storyline was, at the time, his father was dying.  And howww courageous Show was, for continuing to wrestle in the name of his dying father.   Except Bossman was interupting Show's matches via the TitanTron, taunting him with vignettes about how he was stalking his dying dad.  At last, as RAW came on the air, Jim Ross announced that Big Show would not be appearing because his father had died the night before.  The next Thursday on Smackdown!, they were going to air scenes from Papa Show's funeral.  Sure enough, during the burial, Bossman showed up with a tractor and hauled the casket off.   DUMB!!!   What else was dumb, Drew?   What, you want more?  Okay...Doink the Clown, The Ding-Dongs, Edge  Christian wrestling as Los Conquistadores (to their credit, they did beat the Hardy's for the tag belts in that match). the current Super Hero In Training (S.H.I.T) Rosey...  Remember the angle with Mark "Sexual Chocolate" Henry and Mae Young?  Mark was addicted to sex (who isn't?), but when he hooked up with 80-year old Mae Young, he was...ummm...hooked.  Anyway, over the course of time, Mae announced she was pregnant.  Here's the deal:  I like to suspend disbelief while I'm watching wrestling, always.  Make no bones about it.  But when they decided to make Mae young pregnat? At 80?  It wasn't even one of those things where I could say to myself, "how are they going to play this off?".  No, it was more of "please end this crap".  And after a few weeks, they finally did.  The Dudleys put Mae through a table...EMS came out and wheeled her into the back, whereupon she proceeded to "give birth" to a mannequin hand!  DUMB!!!!    I was going to mention HHH bonking a mannequin corpse as well, but I think you, dear reader have heard enough for one day.   Actually...no Drew, I haven't....   What?  Okay fine.  Wasn't even over a year ago when Kane was feuding with HHH.  Trips claimed he had some damning evidence of Kane committing murder on a gal named Katie Vick.  Kane claimed it was a car accident.   Then HHH pulls out his video coverage of Kane at the funeral home.  To every viewer, it was blatantly obvious that is was HHH in a Kane mask, that proceeded to crawl into the casket and make sweet sweet love to the corpse.  DUMB!!!  Actually, now that I think of it...Kane's electrocuting Shane-O's grapefruits doesn't seem to rank as high on the Dumb-O-Meter after all....  Close though.
