(the guy that interviewed e said they were a big company, but I've never heard of them) Anyways, they have a branch downtown called the Creative Group that deals with multimedia stuff. They hired me for the remainder of the summer so I'll be staying in Cleveland for longer than I thought.   Anyways, to celebrate, I'm going to go watch Spiderman 2 now and later get tanked.
