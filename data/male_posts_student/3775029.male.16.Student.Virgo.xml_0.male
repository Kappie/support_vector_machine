I'm gonna have a great time doing them.. :S  Heard from my classmates today was hell. Ha.. glad I didn't go to school today =D Said maths lesson was rough. The whole class got a major lecturing for being in the 'holiday mood'. Totally no mood to study after holidays man.. But can tell everbody is trying very hard. O levels is not something that can be played around with. I'm downright scared of it. 3 more months to the preliminary exams. Gotta really catch up if I want to pass it.   Alright, I'm gonna rest up awhile.. good day to those reading this. Peace.. ;)  "Unleash the power within..."
