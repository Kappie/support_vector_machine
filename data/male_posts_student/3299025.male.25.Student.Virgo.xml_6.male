He, in the dream, was unfortunately in the closet, but I didn't care. He cared about me in an extremely profound way. Anyways, in this dream, he was locked up in jail and I waited diligently until he was released. He gets out of jail, and runs to me and tells me how much he loves me and how glad he is to see me, and he kisses me, then he reaches around my waist, and he feels my love handles. Which do exist, by the way. At this point, he instantly becomes disgusted with me and runs into his large apartment condominium complex. I start yelling at the building, saying "come out here! Tell me why you ran away! I deserve an explanation! Get out here, or I'll tell the whole world what we've done together!!" And to him, being in the closet, as I mentioned earlier, this was quite a threat.   So, instead of coming out himself, he sends his best friend, a rather unattractive Indian woman with dark red lipstick and big teeth. She had very wide hips and adorned them with terribly frumpy looking light brown jeans. She then proceeded to give me a speech along the lines of: "Well, can you blame him? Don't you want someone with a slim, slender physique? Someone with rock hard abs?" I replied calmly, that attractive people needed a better spokesmodel than her. And I also said something that sounded quite sassy in my subconscious: "Your ass, in those jeans, is in no danger of making me bi. And baby, if it did, I would let being bi pass me by." The crowd that had gathered outside at that point roared with laughter, but the emotional pain that I was still feeling in the dream at this point caused me to wake up. The moral of this dream, I'm sure, is something more profound than "don't get an eating disorder and go to the gym", yet, I woke up and resolved to do just that. Hooray for distorted morals.  Ironically, in psychiatry today, we had a lecture about eating disorders. Instead of paying attention to the lecture, I thought about this dream, and how I felt as though I may be a stone's throw away from one of these eating disorders if my subconscious kept beating me up so. I thought about all of my friends with eating disorders, and all of the things they've been through, and I was just like, ugh.  I did learn some interesting things though. When we began talking about bulimia nervosa, a serious disorder characterized by binge eating and purging, either by inducing vomiting, using laxatives, or some other compensatory behavior, they noted that one of the diagnostic criteria was "eating an objectively large amount of food". Objectively large? That's like saying Jessica Alba is objectively prettier than Tara Reid; you sorta get it, but there's nothing objective about it.  But leave it to modern science to take the mystery away. The lecturer circulated a list of foods and "objectively large" amounts of them. Let's take a look at some favorites. And I think this list was from Oxford, so thank the Brits for this.  3 plates of Chinese food. OK, this is a lot of food, but keep in mind that you are always hungry an hour later. This is an easy trap to fall into, I think. Does it count as a purge if it's just the blatant culinary trickery of the Chinese?  5 donuts or 15 donut holes. Hmm? OK, this is a little much, but keep in mind that, for this to be an "objectively large" amount of food, most of us are very capable of comfortably eating such amounts of food, or somewhat less.W e only eat one donut, or a half a donut due to considerable, and admirable psychological restraint. Cuz those Krispy Kremes are gooooood.  5 pieces of a large pizza. Really? People used to count on me in my younger years to polish off at LEAST that many slices of pizza. I mean, especially if that pizza is free, you need to get your money's worth. I certainly don't think that it counts if you are peer pressured into bingeing.  15 Oreos. Um...are these people AWARE of my life? 15 Oreos counted for about 2 and a half pages of a paper in college. I think that the stock price of Nabisco Foods crashed when I finished my senior thesis. My whole rotation came out talking about eating whole boxes of Girl Scouts' Thin Mints. And they call it "objectively large".  3 plates of steamed vegetables. OK, now, I certainly don't want to make light of anyone's eating disorder, so perhaps I should just say that we, as the general public, need to be enlightened about the nature of the steamed vegetable binge. It seems that it is as serious as the Chinese food. Where is the MTV 'True Life' where the 15 year old girl is shamefully lying about the bags of broccoli that she is smuggling out of the Whole Foods, and taking home to steam before mom gets back home? Where is the boy whose parents are keeping the lima beans under lock and key? Where is the Meredith Baxter-Birney after school special about her crudite problem?  All this class has done is convinced me that I do, in fact, have an eating disorder, and that I should go to the gym. Damn. The dialectic process at work.
