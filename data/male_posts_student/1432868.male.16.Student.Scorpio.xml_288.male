I'm a good driver and I know that...It's just that I haven't tried the entire course with my current car exactly as it is in the test. That for some reason worries me..   meh I'll prolly do fine but I'm gonna be kicking myself for a while if I screw this one up...(see archives from December for last attempt summary.)
