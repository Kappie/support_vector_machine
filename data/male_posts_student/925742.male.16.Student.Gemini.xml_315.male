Its like, I'm paranoid that the next dude I see will start shit with me and I need to take a course of action.  Such as if he were to push me, pat my stomach or something, I would proceed to strike at his solar plexus with a palm hand.  Its like I'm overreacting, but then I continue to think, well, what if he dodges (unlikely) or somehow blocks it?  Well then I would proceed to pivot and smash his face into the brick wall.  If he would throw a taekwondo punch at me, then I would twist his arm.  By twisting his arm to a near breaking point, I would then manage to somehow walk up the ramp and toss him over the edge, breaking his legs.  Ah, so violent.  I think its from my brother's influence on my life.   Well, thats as far as you're going to see into my mind today.  Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.
