She understands how I feel and I really appreciate that. Jenni and me are fine now.. We're close and like each other's company.. I promised her I'll wait for her and I asked her whether she'll wait for me.. She will.. I'm really glad and grateful to hear that from her.. She still likes me and of course I do like her a lot.. Hehe! Things are getting normal between me and Jenni.. Today I woke up.. Had noodles for breakfast.. Went to the nearest plaza to get a haircut.. Kinda short but ok.. Bought some stationaries.. Not much happenings today...Maybe tonight.. *sIgHzZ* I'm doing my Social Studies work now.. Must complete it or my S.S teacher will nag..Nag..Nag... Hahaha!! That's for now.. Peace Out!!
