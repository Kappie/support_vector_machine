But before all that, after I was disgusted at Mcdonalds, I came home and did nothing. I just sat at home and then around 6:00 my dad asked me if I wanted to go to the pool with him and my brother. So I did and swam a little with Tony and Mark because they were there. Then I decided to walk home. So I walked home and got dressed and then just listened to music. And then my sister told me some of my friends where here. It was Brian and Melissa. They walked over to visit me. We came down in my basement and had some pretty interesting converstaions lol. Remember your drawing Melissa, I forgot to throught it away lol, but my dad did and I don't think he saw it lol becuase it was all crumpled up in a ball. And remember how Brian was molested as a child :-) Nah, I'm just joking with you Brian. You two need to come and visit me more often. I emailed you Brian like you told me too! Well they stayed till around 9:20 and then Melissa's mom came and picked them up. Then, I went and got online, and CJ was just be a retard, he kept making Andrew show me all this stuff because CJ "had to talk to me" for some reason. So I unblock him, and he is just being his stupid self. We get into the argument of Animals and reason again. And we find out CJ is wrong like always. He still believes dogs can reason, I find it pretty funny how he won't give it up. He kept telling me that I'm stubborn, and I tell him all the times I actually said I was wrong, but he would not give it up, even after me and Nick told him too. He didn't though, because he just thinks he has to prove he is better than me. He said next time I annoy him or something he is gonna hurt me physically. And I laughed and went, "oh yeah that proves awhole lot doesn't it CJ" and he got all mad and said I'm gonna get hurt and all this. Well CJ if you have to become physical to try to prove to everyone you are somebody, you're sad. You are one of those sad people that the commercials talk about on TV about violence. I actually kinda feel sorry for you. But if beating me up proves anything to you, you need help. If I annoy you, maybe you should just leave me alone. Because you even said I leave you alone. But thats another story. After that I found something out that I wasn't really happy about. Not that they have it, just how it got there, and even both of them. Hmm, I'll have to find out. Well after my chat room about the animals with reason, I washed my face and headed off to bed. Then, I got up, and took my shower and went up to get a hair cut. And guess what, it's short. Yes you heard it right, its all gone, i have short hair. It's nice now that I don't have to do anyhtign to my hair now, I can just get up and go. And it won't look like a frow anymore which is a plus. So I'm happy about it. After that, I just came home and its really hot outside. Let me check the tempature. Yeah the "feels like tempature" is 90. That's crazy. At least my new hair cut will keep me cool a little. But yeah, I had pizza rolls and fries for lunch. They were good. And now I'm just listening to music, and just keeping cool. That's about it. Well I'll talk to you later! See-ya
