    
       I'm depressed. And I can finally summarize why. I have no love and have no idea what to do with my future. Thank you for your time, please sign the guestbook on the way out.  But anyways, my notions on love are getting out of hand. I find myself fantasizing about the most absurd scenarios, in which the guy I like will magically show up at my door and make love to me. I'm hopeless.  As for the other issue, I'm royally fucked. I'm abandoning acting, which leaves me with interests in Religion and Japanese, but definately not a combination of the two.   That first paragraph is still pretty damn true.
