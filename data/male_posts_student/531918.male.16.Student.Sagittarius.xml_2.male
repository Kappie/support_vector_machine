There are too many examples of how Atkins is ruining the world.  - McDonald's, in what I feel is a response to "Super Size Me" (which I no longer have the desire to see), recently created their Adult Happy Meals, which consist of a salad and a bottle of water.  That's it.  What a meal.  Starving Ethiopians would demand more. - The simple fact that McDonald's offers salads is really a joke, if you think about it.  I can't imagine some trucker going down I-95 and thinking the following: "Wow!  There's a McDonald's at this exit!  I need a salad!" - Burger King (which is way better than McDonald's, in my humble opinion) has seven low-carb sandwiches available.  Counterpoint: on this menu is "The Angus", which was quite possibly the best burger I've ever had from a fast food venue. - Subway has their low-carb wraps available.   - Every food item possible that can have the Atkins logo on it has the Atkins logo on it.  Look around.  The gym commercials you see on television are eminent of this too.  The main reason most gyms give for why people should come there (Bally comes to mind) is to resolve a "lack of energy".  Maybe they'd have more energy if they digested some carbohydrates every once in a while.  Of course, the capitalist pigs we live under have to make money somehow, so the energy drink craze happened.  There are too many.  Granted, some of them, like the Snapple Elements drinks, are very good (albeit only six of them are energy drinks, and they are pretty hard-to-find).  However, how many energy drinks are there?  Red Bull.  Amp.  Rockstar.  Sobe.  Erektus.  Red Stallion.  Some of them are just ridiculous. - V8, that tomato-ridden veggie-juice that is "okay", has come out with Invigor8. - Rappers' energy drinks, like Pimp Juice or Crunk, are just marketing ploys and gimmicks.  However, the worst gimmick, by far, belongs to Gay Fuel.  That's right: Gay Fuel.  Don't believe me?  Here's some  urlLink underlined words .  America, we have a problem.
