One of the things I've always thought about myself (if not necessarily always exhibiting it) was that I was basically from the country (i.e. rural) at heart, but lately it's become a dominant theme.  For instance, I pretty much only listen to country music any more; it's gone so far that two of the songs on my rotation are "Redneck Woman" and "It's OK to be a Redneck", I know where Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, and Shania Twain are all from (Ohio, Australia, and Canada, respectively), and I even found myself watching the CMA awards on TV the other day.  But it's gone a lot farther than just the music - I've been saying "y'all" and "howdy" for a while now, but now it's progressing into the tone and manner of my speech.  I used to interject all kinds of "big words" into my conversations, but anymore my main goal has simply to come across as friendly and laid-back (which generally means using "small words").  And I've been finding myself more and more drawn to the out-of-doors lately.  I went out and visited my aunt and uncle in rural Virginia on my way home from DC, and I have to say that I felt more comfortable out there than I've felt in a long time.  Maybe it's weird to some people, but the smells and the openess and everything just appeal to me in a way that the city and suburbs never could.  Maybe the heart of all of this is an attempt on my part to get in touch with the simpler parts of myself, to reach back and revive the way I was back when we lived in the country before we moved up to Hudson.  And I think that the two things I'm trying to realize most are a simplified worldview where the most important consideration in anything I do is whether it's right or not and a straight-forward perspective on things where I feel free to speak my mind.  Of course, if I remember correctly this way I was didn't exactly get me a whole lot of friends (although it probably was about the same number as I have now), but at least I felt at peace with myself.
