Today my parents and me went and did the best thing ever for a sixteen year old desparate for forward propulsion: car shopping! That's right, it shant be long now. Yay! No more being dependent on other people's cars.  This weekend I finally fell to the yelling of the masses. I bought a Playstation 2. Peer pressure is a great force (just kidding, I'd been wanting one for a while). It was my birthday present, though my b-day isn't till the 19th. Speaking of which: 12 days! But before that I have to pass the minefield of midterm exams on the week leading up to it. I have my birthday off, how's that for niceity?
