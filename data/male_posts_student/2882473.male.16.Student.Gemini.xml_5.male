I'll probably be sounding like an old person when I say this, but I'm sure young people had much more respect for their elders many years ago. Why do these people just want to disobey adults, and laugh in the face of law and order? I tell you, it is these 'rudebois' who will be responsible for the breakdown of society and the introduction of guns for the police, which will then result in the increased levels of guns on the streets, meaning more guns for police, meaning the relaxing of gun laws untill it is leagal to carry a gun, which will be the point where we turn American and I commit suicide. I blaim partly America (as always) and partly this 'modern' music, which is more of just noise. People such as Eminem and 'Blazing Squad' (see Deutsches D's blog) have such a large influence on todays teens, and they 'sing' about sex, violence, drugs, and then get caught carrying knives and guns and complain they are being badly treated.   The second point I wanted to make was about drugs. Why do people even consider to take illeagal substances? What is the appeal of taking a substance that will potentialy kill you, or seriously harm your health? Supposedly the answer is 'peer pressure' which I don't fully understand, possibly because I'm not bothered what my friends think of me. If they were really your friends, they would not care that you don't wear expensive clothes (or in my case cheap clothes) Another point, drugs are also extremely expensive, which in order to finance, increases the levels of gun crime on our streets. As my english teacher would say: 'they are inextricably interwoven', in a welsh accent, or course.
