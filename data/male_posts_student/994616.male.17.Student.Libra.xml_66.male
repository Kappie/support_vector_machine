Anyways i did 20 min on the bike at 100 rpm compared to my usual 12 min at 90 rpm, so after that i was exhausted. just thinking about it now i realise thats almost a  90% increase . I stretched then did some leg stuff and bla bla bla its not that interesting so I'm going to stop typing about it.   oh and now for the semi mandatory bitch about touch typing. for some reason i can do it when  i cant see my hands. otherwise it is so incredibly difficult for no apparent reason.  1up shroom  me for going to the gym  oisosned shroo,: me for having 2 mini picnics 3 mini snickers and 6 oreos thereby rendering my gym experience useless...
