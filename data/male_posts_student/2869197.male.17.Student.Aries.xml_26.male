He is a feeble man, forgetting small things like names and wallets, and his wife is extremely sick and in a hospital. I agree with this man. I truly fear few things in life and old age is one of them. I hate the idea of living in an assisted living place more than much else. Death I can stand. When I die, I become greater than I was before, robed in radiant white and ageless. But old age is worse, old age is inability and dependence on other humans. I pity people who live their lives in some foolish hope of immortality, that if they keep going just a little further some miraculous scientific cure for infirmity be made and all will be well. That said, I will live my life to its end, even old age and death. I believe I am nothing but a tool of the Most High, and I will work for him until my ticket is punched. I will live my life without fear of death and do whatever I feel led to do. Perhaps God will bless me with a death at the top of my existence, but if He doesn't, I will continue all the same. Old age does have some blessings: knowledge, a warming aura of nonviolence (no one expects the old Grandma be packing heat), and amnesia towards the unimportant things in life (like names).
