If this works out, I'll start a separate blog for my writing and poems.   Old gone days   There is not much of a sadder thing than the ramblings of a poet whoâ€™s lost everything.  Lamentations of days gone past; long past. Regret is the black tide. Wash over me, me over.  Damn naivety. 'Twas for the goal; for the gold. The prize was price paid for ignorance.  Time was opposition. Procrastination, my ally. Overly conquered foe. Too much of a friend.  After all, I am faced with resolve.
