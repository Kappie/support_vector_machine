I don't think so...im grateful for ppl's concern for me whenever i go off on walks but i dunno...somethings i can't put into words...not the right time to i don't think.  Well...it is good that im in good company...im just spilling random  thoughts into here.  I'm getting better..im just kinda trying to fix myself before attending to other ppl and no1 can fix me but myslef and God. Yes He is indeed the building block within me.  - F.R.O.G dully rely on God. I intend on doing that from now on.  Marky>
