It has a good strong beat and almost a jazzy melody; I love jazz.  I have true admiration for Stevie Wonder.  The man is blind and still manages to play a mean piano.  Yeah! Go handicapped people!  Ms. Pedigo was telling us about the summer camp which she volunteers at for a week.  She told us about a fellow counselor who is confined to a wheelchair but decided to go for a dip in the lake last year and took his chair with him.  Needless to say the ELECTRIC wheelchair wasn't waterproof, and it didn't work too well after that little incident.  Ms. Pedigo was talking about trashcan fires in one of her speech classes a few days ago.  There was one in the boy's restroom today.  Mr. Campbell said that it was more of a smoldering than a fire, in his e-mail to the teachers.  In the near future, Science Fair is tomorrow.  It is weird; as much as I dislike Science Fair I am almost looking forward to tomorrow night.  I pray that we will do well, Spencer and I worked really hard on it.  In the distant future, I am going to Europe.  This summer we are going to England, France, and Switzerland.  I am really excited-never been to Europe.  The only downside that I have found is that a certain french teacher's son who is our age but seemingly immature and rather annoying and has the same name as one of my good friends whose last name is Thomas, is going.  Oh well, perhaps he won't be too bad.  The play is quickly approaching.  I have a feeling that the pit will suck...what's new, right?  I have good friends.  A few might be slightly misguided, but good.  Spencer was leading a sing-a-long during lunch in the library.  I will sincerely miss Mrs. Maag when she leaves for back surgery.  I hope that I can deal with Mrs. Wright; I'll just take it day by day.  I made an awesome paper airplane in seventh hour.  The fat bitch from the land of satan stole it, that's right-we all know who I am talking about...it's Bethany!  No, just...um...kidding.  For those of you who don't know---BRITTAN RUDOLPH HEADED TO THE GYNO---yesterday she went because she has been having some nasty cramps.  When she told Gregg she had cramps he asked if they were in her leg!  Yeah Gregg, that's why she is grabbing her crotch, she has a leg cramp.  I asked my neighbor and good family friend to be my sponsor for conformation, he said "Sure, I'd love to!"  One small complication, he is a faithful catholic and is married but didn't get his first marriage annuled.  He talked to father and was told that it would be best if he wasn't my sponsor.  I need a new one!  WHO?  I don't know but I'll figure it out.  I don't have much of a choice.  Wow this has been a long blog.  Well, I could apologize and close up but I'm not going to.  No, I am going to explain the meaning of life.  First of all, the meaning of life is supposed to be some big huge unanswerable question.  Newsflash people, LIFE is a word-that means that is a definition a.k.a. meaning.  The following are the meanings of life: 1. existence in the physical world: the quality that makes living animals and plants different from dead organisms and inorganic matter. Its functions include the ability to take in food, adapt to the environment, grow, and reproduce.  2. living individual: a living being, especially a person, often used when referring to the number of people killed in an accident or a war ( usually used in the plural )  Two hundred lives were lost in the crash. 3. living things considered together: a group of living things, usually of a particular kind She was an expert on plant life in the Amazon. 4. whole time somebody is alive: the entire period during which somebody is, has been, or will yet be alive All my life I?ve wanted to learn to fly. 5. time when something functions: the period during which something continues to function Cheap batteries usually have short lives. 6. some part of somebody?s life: a particular aspect of somebody?s life social life.  7. human activity: human existence or activity in general real life.  8. life imprisonment: life imprisonment ( informal )  9. way in which somebody lives: the character or conditions of an individual?s existence Most people in this city lead hard lives. 10. characteristic way of living: a way of living that is characteristic of a particular place or group country life.  11. biography: an account of a somebody?s life, usually in writing, but sometimes in other media such as film, video, or radio He was the author of ?The Life of Galileo.? 12. vitality: animation and vitality, or something that produces animation or vitality We liked him because he was so full of life.  13. artist?s subject: something real used as a subject by an artist, especially human models, who are often nude She always insisted on painting from life.  From the previous reading I have come to two conclusions.  The first is that people should not ask "What is the meaning of life?"  but rather "What is the purpose of my life?".  The second is that I have absolutely no idea what I am talking about and if you have read this entire entry you are almost as pathetic as myself.  If you skimmed through the definitions I can't say that I blame you, but I can say you are a dirty lying son-of-a-bitch.    Have a nice day!
