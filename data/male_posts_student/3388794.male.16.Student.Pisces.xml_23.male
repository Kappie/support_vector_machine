I sit here and wonder what made me write such a noible language, surely it cannot be this world, it is too fake. it is full of anger, it asks too much of too many bad questions. I am sure you will agree that the world is slowly falling down a sink, slowly bieng washed down, like a spider in a bath tub by a scared mother.   I wonder at how life is suddenly better, how it is that i have become so substantial a personnality, that finally love isn't a bitch, it doesnt hurt. it leaves a glow, there is no need for stage names masks and sheets. thank you. i can be me again.  i love you.
