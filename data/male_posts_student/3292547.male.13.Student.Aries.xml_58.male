Not very comfortable when at least one is itching all the time.  Tomorrow happens to be the *big* day that I change the layout. I've somewhat decided with what everyone has said. Anyway, I'm about to update the template scource on my computer in case anything happens. It's still the old one with book 8 showing, but that's not much of a big change.  I can't promise when it'll change, but the template isn't the important part of all this. It's the blog. =-) But you can't live without all the nifty little addons and gadgets in life now can you?
