I need a place to store my writings so that people can see them... since Poetry.com is money grubbing, and has limited space I've decided to come here... Well here are the first 3 pieces to join this maiden voyage...   The Thoughts of A Dreamer  As a dreamer stands tall...  Alone and shattered he wanders... Always drifting in the wind... Always falling towards his fate... Struggling to find his destiny Fighting the loneliness in his heart... What future is there to come…? For one who has seen the pain…. Who’s lost in the eyes of society... And trapped in the void Forever lost in his soul. I must always wonder... Starring up at the stars every night Is there truly a place for me? Will I find my fantasy? Is there truly destiny? Is there truly love for me? Will I ever be free? For many long years I've dreamed of these things... Searching for the truth Yet always finding deceit... Trying to step forward But pushed back so far Where is the place in time...? Where darkness ends... And light begins... The day I find identity... And one day find true destiny... That day shall come to me some time... But for now I must always wonder... When... Where... How... Who...? Such things have always journeyed my mind Yet I feel so broken... Battered down by my past Through the ages I drift... Waiting for the answers I may never find... Hoping for the dreams that may never come... Yet I still stand strong... Never losing faith...   Another Day...  Another day to dream a dream...  Another day the stars don't gleam... Another broken soul to mend... Except my own... it shall not end... And so I look up to the sky... With hopes that one day I will fly... And that one day your world will see... This thing that I call destiny... But it is here I still remain... With fragile dreams that I obtain... Someday you just might understand… The task I put into my hands… Of Chronia you hear me speak… It is this world to which I seek… I pray this world shall remain safe… For in Chronia I place my faith… To escape the pain of society’s blight… It is in this dream I find my light… And though I cannot see my star… Inside my dream’s it’s never far… I hope that I return to her… And prove that I’m not just a Dreamer… But here I stand, alone and cold… With dreams not shared, and thoughts untold… But I swear! All is not in vain… Although my life is endless rain… I have a few who stand by me… Who opened their hearts and set me free… These are the few who gave me wings… And show me the happiness your world brings… Even they do not understand… It is I alone who comprehend My Dreams, my Fate, my Destiny… And all the things inside of me… So I remain the only one… To know the truth to what I’ve begun… Human, or Chronian… no difference to me… For I believe in both you see… I am on Earth each passing day…  But on Wings of Time I fly away… As Casartello of the Human race… And Dynedockia of Chu’Bwa Ku’ Space… Two entities exist inside… They are my passion, they are my pride… My heart will heal, my mind has grown… As I slowly drift into the unknown… It does not matter wherever I go… For in my soul I shall always know… There’s always tomorrow… that’s when it may come… And the race against Fate has finally begun…   This is Our World  War is among us… and slowly losing cause… This is our World… We sit back and watch as our children are sent off to die… This is our World… Our society reeks of Corruption… This is our World… The mainstream floats to the top,  as the idealists, the visionaries, the dreamers,  and the different people of this world  slowly drown in their wake… This is our World… Our minds are filled with greed,  And we constantly search for glory, for power, for more… This is our World… We discriminate towards so many,  “They are inferior to us, and don’t deserve the same rights we have” This is our World… Where people stand up and fight the system,  But are battered down by the sheer mass of the opposition… This is our World… We cannot change society… for it is far to big for it to change in whole… This is our World… Through Fire… Justice is Served… This is our World… Even when the odds turn us away, one will still step forward and face society… This is our World… One will let go of his feelings as an outcast,  and open his eyes to the ways of the Dreamer… This is our World… It is I that shall be the one… With clear mind, open heart, and dreams that shall change this world… This is our World… A mainstream has learned to free their minds  and slowly accept the thoughts and ideas of a Radical Dreamer… This is your World… You have all slowly grown… in your own ways… and in your own aspirations…. This is your World… As we slowly travel into tomorrow…  You will all move into the future with strong foundations, And Minds ready for whatever it may bring… This is your World… And as we head towards that day, we stand strong,  Ready to fight whatever the world puts in our way… That is our World… While you spent your days growing up… One was left behind… That was my World… A poor soul who never really got the chance to fit in… That was my World… A boy who’s good nature was forgotten, or worse… never known… That was my World… Until now… Beyond the pain I have felt… lies a place beyond all sorrow… That is my World… A place that has shaped my destiny…  and forged the dreams that lie deep inside my soul… That is my World… In the Galaxy of Chu’Bwa Ku’… on the distant world called Chronia… That is my World… Of Hawk Dynedockia… the Master of time…  And Fate… which cast him away… with the words…  “You are nothing but a dreamer… Fool.” That is my World… And So I wait… and I dream… and I believe in tomorrow… This is my World… With Companions who I hope shall help through the journey that is our lives…  That is my World… We march towards the future… with eyes looking to destiny… Let it be a fulfilling one for all of us… That is our World!  There we are...  Enjoy... and please feel free to add a comment, I enjoy the feedback!  Through Fire, Justice is Served!  No matter how shattered... or how broken... or how impossible they may be... Dreams never die... as long as you beleive.... and I do... - Hawk Dynedockia
