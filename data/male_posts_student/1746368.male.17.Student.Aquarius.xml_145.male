Right now I think I need to add my mood back to the left sidebar. I always thought of that as a really neat-o thing. *Does that right now and plays some cheesy muzak*  Okay I'm back. I just edited in my mood. Now that wasn't so hard...was it?  I am bored and I am thinking of some more features to put on the site to make it more interactive. Anything short of a message board tag thing (that's what I have TD for) is acceptable. If you wanna suggest something, feel free to put in a word at the comments. It doesn't even have to be blog related. I will just add it to a new section called "In-Site"  "Shooter: Just stay out of my way, or you'll pay. Listen to what I say!    Happy: How 'bout I just go eat some hay? I could make things out of clay and lay by the bay, I just may. What do you say?" --Happy Gilmore
