Game 7 monday, woooooooooooooooooooooooo! Gotta love Bert haha. My shirt smells like smoke, (bonfire the other night, drugs are bad kids) yeah and my girlfriend Carrie decides to break up with me for some weird reason, all of a sudden like a couple days ago she decides she doesn't  feel the same  about me anymore! I mean what the hell? I figure she's some flitty/fickle person who lacks a lot of maturity like some people tell me. Which leads me to feel that I didn't do anything wrong! Oh well, that makes me feel better to know that I'm normal, and yet again, another girl i've dated, isn't. And the normal ones always end up friends, or nothing really happens.  I have a feeling Karen still wants us to get back together, but hmmm, I might put that thought off until summer.  So many girls out there, so many have issues...geez. So it's back to the single life, until I finally find myself in a real strong relationship.  Jen made me drink the other night, I told her there's no way im drinking, but god-damn I don't know how she got me to in the end. This isn't over! But I wasn't drunk at all, no really, I guess I was buzzed, but drunk? I don't think so...Yeah I wasn't drunk.  Damn people with perfect pitch, it just makes me...so jealous!  Man, I could really go for some IHOP right now, mmm, delicious warm crepes and pancakes with that butter swirls mixed in with real fruits.  And a choice of 5 syrups...oooooooh.  Gulliver's better start work soon, I needs the cash to get my cd player, and pay some other bills, they just keep coming!  God monday night tv sucks, cbs and their lame comedies, like that one, "baby bob" where the freaking kid talked like an adult, and suddenly knew about everything going on in the world, and acting all smarter than everyone else.  What the fuck is wrong with cbs for them to churn out crap like that? God!
