Last sunday (when the smackdown! tapings are on at my house) i missed smackdown because the stupid local TV station went nuts and played reruns of crap over and over and over again...but oh well  Hopefully the next time wrestling comes through town I can get a ticket. I missed it last time it was in Ames and I was pissed!!!
