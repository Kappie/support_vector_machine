GODAWFUL REFEREES.   Not about inconsistencies this time...justnot calling shit - then calling a weak-ass hook on Lidstrom!?!  AND YES - there was more shit that they didn't call against Detroit than against Calgary.  This was just a tough, mean game all the way around....So much shit not called...So tight....IF the Wings pull it out, they will get WASTED by San Jose.
