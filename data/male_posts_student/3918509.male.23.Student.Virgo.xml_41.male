One played "Orc #2" in the Dungeons and Dragon's movie. Another is the CEO of a major Canadian hockey equipment company. There is another fellow who is a figure skater.   I only spotted references to myself twice on the list, and neither reference was all too important. Here is the link from the  urlLink third page of the search . The only other mention of me came from  urlLink page twelve  of the results.   The latter reference fills me with much more pride, but comparing my results with some of the other Matthew O'Tooles makes me feel pretty insignificant. I need to either get my name in the news orcreate a Google bomb.
