The bums around the University Belt and other schools...   4. The professors who I wished they were not teaching anymore... Due to their belief "I am the teacher, I am the fountain of knowledge"...   5. Friendster... Wala lang!   6. Children (as in minors) inside internet cafes, playing counter-strike or ragnarok.   7. Children inside internet cafes, watching and wondering what the user do... It's none of their businness!  8. University of the East... They don't declare class suspension during rallies, transportation strikes, and storms... If they did, it would be at the end of the day or when the students got here after a bad trip from their houses...   9. Pop-ups... The greatest distraction on every surfer's life. All these and more soon...
