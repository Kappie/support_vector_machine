In fact it wasn't with thanks at all.  I'm going to Jess's party on Friday night, I think. I should prolly find some alcy to bring. Meh. Do I even wanna get drunk?  I think I'm falling on (bad choice of words). Let's try that again. I think I'm falling for Jess. She's being really nice to me. She's like "Oooh, I love you Adam!" I'm like *:|* "What the?" Except... It's good. I like it. Do I like Jess? Does Jess even like me? I think I'm misguided. I think I'd take anything I can get at the moment.  Um... Yeah. She's nice, and not too bad looking and meh! I bet she's already got a man. That or she's a dyke.  I'm so confused!  *scream*
