Wanting to be a teacher/preacher, I am trying to develop 3 points to share, so far all I have is one and that is man the ol' body is stubborn.  I have regained a renewed enthusiasm for exercise, my mind is already at my appointed goal, 180 lbs., exactly half the man I am now.  My legs are somewhat cooperative but lungs are still languishing in the mire and misery of being overweight.  All this seems collorary to my Christian walk, my mind is in mostly Heaven (notice that Ephesians 2:6 is in the present tense) but my carnal mind and body is still focused on worldly things, what am I going to eat?  Do I REALLY have to walk 2 MILES TODAY?  Then after the huffing and puffing and the profuse sweating, pride creeps in says "Chad you are the man!!!!!!"  I suppose all this is a long-winded way of saying, all of us are treadmills of sorts, working and striving but not going anywhere but thanks be to God who move us, animates us and transforms us into something not carnal and temporary but something eternal and glorious. All praise to him!!!!!!!!!!
