See this friend is majorly in love with a girl. He's also pretty good friends with her. Now, he might have a good reason for this that's not know to me, but he won't and hasn't told her. He beleives it will hurt her. This friend has started into the self mutilation, razors; tacks and scissors. I never really knew and never woulda guessed. It's scaring me. I mean, I'm like any other teen. I have my periods of depression and I know a little of what it feels like. But never that far. What I'm getting at here is that I'm starting to think I need a way to tell her. I feel bad at betraying my friends trust in me over this since he told me who it was but I also can't stand seeing him hurt like this.  So if you're reading this man (Unlikely but possible), I'm sorry. It needs to be done. You're on a downward spiral. Been there, done that. It's not pretty. The only difference is that I know I hide my depression better. Either you tell her how you feel or I do. Ask her out. If she says no then fine. You love her enough to just be friends if that's all she wants right? And secondly, you fucking think she'd be impressed with this shit? I would bet a shitload of money that wether she loves you or not she doesn't want to see you like this.  And neither do I.  Don't feed me any bullshit about me having a girlfriend and therefor not knowing what it's like. I got news for you, I was in love with her for three fucking years before we started going out. Hear that? I'm sorry man but you have no freaking room to complain. And I almost forgot about that space where she dumped me for awhile. I'm willing to bet that's even worse. In fact I know it is. I was still completely in love with her and even more unsure over what she felt than before. But as I said, I loved her enough to just be friends because that's all she wanted.That being said, I feel your pain and I know what it's like. I hold complete sympathy for you but somehow I don't think that's what you want or need.  I also read about how you're not sure how any of your friends can respect you. Newsflash. It's because we're your  friends . That's all there is to it. I'm your friend man and always will be. So is everyone else. In fact, same goes for the Bluefish. None of us would simply desert you. Anyone who would can't be truly counted as a friend. When we did Julius Caesar in english class I remember hating Brutus. I couldn't give a fuck what his reasons were, he abandoned his best friend. Not only abandoned him but literally stabbed him in the back as well. Neither of you would get that from me and I hope from none of your other friends. My parents dislike most of you guys and I know it. It doesn't stop me from being your friend. I'm not your friend because I want to make a statement. I'm not your friend for the conveniance. I'm not your friend because I think it'll make me cool. I'm your friend because I like you and enjoy your company. You guys cheer me up, make me feel better and let me live life. I doubt any of you really realise how much you guys mean to me. How many of you would guess how depressed I've been for the last five months or so? None I'd hope. I don't like placing my problems on the shoulders of others. But you've all helped me never the less. Thank you.  Well, I'm worn out out for this evening. Can't think of anything else to write. It feels good to get this stuff down though. I can be almost positive none of you will ever read this but there's always a chance. So, to my (best) friend who hates the world, I'll leave you with this little thought: Has it occured to you that you're hurting the both of you far more by not telling her? Think about it.
