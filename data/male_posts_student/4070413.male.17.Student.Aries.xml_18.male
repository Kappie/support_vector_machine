Maybe in the darkness, it is easily for me to recollect myself. the more i want it this way, it will turn out the opposite. There are lots of changes made, but my stubborness remains. Don't really likes to do things which i think it will work the way i think because i hate to see my assumption turns out incorrect. As people always praise my intelligence, i more afraid if i cannot prove them right. Am i really that intelligence or am i just lucky? Before i can be myself again, i have to keep on acting. As it is really tiring, thats why i always want to behave like a kid.
