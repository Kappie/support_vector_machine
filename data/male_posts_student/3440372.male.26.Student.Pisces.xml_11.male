It just seems like a really strange thing to do.  On a different note-I have just finished watching an episode halfway through season four of Angel (the turgid supernatural soap opera, for those who don't know) I have had many discussions with my SO about which is better, Buffy or Angel, with her in the Angel camp and with me firmly by Buffy's side. Angel is much better written but for sheer enjoyment it has to be Buffy every time.  The evil Anjelus has returned to wreak havoc on Los Angeles and be 10 times funnier than Angel. Whatever will happen next kids? Answers on a postcard, a prize for the best one.  I think this is an appropriate place to stop waffling and go to bed.
