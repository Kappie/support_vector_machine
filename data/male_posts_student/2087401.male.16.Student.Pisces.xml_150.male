As far as "widespread" goes, at the time Marten notified you of my "angry letter," Marten, Thomas, Sophia, and I think Nathan (I'm not sure about the others) were all getting fed up with it as well. They didn't put it in any form of print; the communication was strictly vocal. I'm tired now and I'm going to bed. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
