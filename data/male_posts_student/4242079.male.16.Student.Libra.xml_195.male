Well, I have, but it was easily pushed aside or moved to the back burner. Or just plain unwanted. Or unclear. But now. Now it's different. Now I know exactly what I want. Well, not exactly. I suppose there's always room for compromise. But you know. I want it so badly now, and I...I feel so angry at the degree of difficulty there is to finding what you want in this world. So much anger.
