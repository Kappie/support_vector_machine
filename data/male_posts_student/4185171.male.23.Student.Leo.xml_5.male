I got it for parking on the street when it was scheduled to be swept.  Kinda like streets being cleared for snow emergencies, except that it’s not an emergency.  These Californians must really like to keep their streets clean if they feel the need to sweep them once a week.  It’s that or palm trees produce a lot more waste than I ever imagined.  	Since Dad has left my days have been pretty low key.  I get up, play a little Xbox, eat a little something, think of some errand to run, and ride my bike.  Those are the kind of things I fill my day with.  It’s not boring yet.  It still feels like vacation.  Sure, I mix up my days with a few other things to do such as going to the gay cyber coffee shop.  I figure it’s a tradeoff.  I get to use their internet connection, and they get to look at me.  Seems fair.  Okay, they’re getting hosed… but I really need their internet connection.  I don’t have an internet connection at my apartment, and I’ll be honest, I don’t have many leads on how to get it.   	This sunburn needs to go away soon.  I’ve based my activities for the past few days on the time of day they could be done so that I don’t have to feel the burn of the mid-day sun.  I should have figured the sun would be a lot more intense out here.  I’m so foolish.  But I will say that the areas of my body that have recovered from the burn are looking quite good.  	Oon Saturday night Dan, Jon and I went to a party in West Hollywood.  It sounded a lot more glamorous than it ended up being.  How did we end up at a party in West Hollywood you ask?  Dan’s ex-girlfriend’s friend from high school lives out here and knew somebody who was throwing a party who invited us.  Yeah, it was kind of a round about way to get invited, but we’re willing to take any bone that gets thrown our way at this point.  I can’t say that it was overly exciting.  Basically, the three of us stuck together in a little herd.  I/we did meet one interesting girl.  Genessa’s from Orange County, and she said she’d show me around Long Beach sometime this week.  It’ll be nice to learn some of the more intricate parts of my new hometown.  It will also be nice to talk to someone not Dan, Jon, my father, or a complete stranger.    	I’ve started saving my receipts from all the purchases I’ve made since I got here.  It’s like entering into a whole new stage of adulthood.  	Beth Burnes informed me while I was on the phone with her tonight she thought the state bird of California is the California quail.  It sounds made up to me.  She might be a liar just like Dad.  But again I don’t have any choice but to believe her.  I will give her credit for bothering to care about my fascination with state birds and at least making an attempt at finding California’s for me unlike anyone else.  That’s right, I’m talking to you…  	All of the incoming graduate students at USC were given each others emails so that we could email each other with comments, questions, invitations and the like.  After receiving a few of these emails I’m beginning to fear meeting some of these people.  Not all of these mass emails I’ve received have made me fear meeting the other incoming students at USC.  (I haven’t yet sent one out.  I’m choosing to remain a mysterious stranger until orientation begins.)  But a few of them have left me with a bit of doubt if I can ever really get along with these people.  I’m sure I’m just being cynical, but I thought I’d give a sampling of the two worst offenders.    	The first guy to send out one of these mass emails was a bit too excited for my taste.  Now I understand more than anything he was just probably nervous, but really I don’t think that’s an excuse for spelling “What’s up?” with a “Z”.  It’s just not necessary.  Later offenses in his email included using the phrase “keen on having some contact” with other incoming students.  Excuse me, did you just use the word “keen”.  I don’t know how they do it in Connecticut, but in Minnesota that word went out with “Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?”  And not the crappy new Scooby-Doo shows or the stupid movies.  Jinkies…  He also tried to be way too cool.  Despite his best efforts to cover his tracks he was quite stiff with his language.  I mean, I already know he’s going to get his Ph.D in chemistry.  His cool train left the station a long time ago.  Even I know that.  	The second offenders email was not as long, but the content was so… I don’t even know what to call it.  I’ll just cut and paste because I will never be able to find the words to describe.  Anybody from the gang is interested in going for the Phil Collins "First Final Farewell Tour", he is performing at Staples  Center close  to USC  on August 31 at 20:00 hours.  I am a big fan of Phil, and plan to go there, if there are people willing to join, it will be great.  U can check the site: http://www.philcollins.co.uk for Details  Reaction from Kiah: Stunned Silence… more silence… an uncomfortable laugh… Lordy what am I getting myself into.  (Note: Any fans of Phil Collins reading this that are currently offended, I apologize.  Get a copy of Rolling Stone magazine.)
