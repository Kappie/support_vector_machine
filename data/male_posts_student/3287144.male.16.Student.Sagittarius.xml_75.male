Fortunately though the opticians where quite empty and so my delay wasn't of much importance to anyone except myself.  The rest of the day has been idled away but I have decided to go for this job I was offered tomorrow so in preparation for that I have assembled the following; a thermos flask for coffee [in case it is a cold day], a bottle for water [in case it is hot day] and a copy of George Orwell - Nineteen Eighty Four [in case it is a boring day].  Apparently my payment will be of Â£50 so I will be very happy once I get it and I also get to give someone a little present who I otherwise wouldn't see for a long time - all in all - it should be okay if all goes well!
