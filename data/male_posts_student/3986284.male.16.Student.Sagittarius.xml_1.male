I'm gonna tell you all right now, if it wasn't for Matt being blood, he would be laying in a puddle of it. I'm serious, I hate him as a person. I could of killed him many times today, but I just couldn't do it b/c he is blood. Lol, motherfucker got pissed off at me b/c of the car and tore my shirt then threw a can of soda at me. That's nothing though, I hate him. And he's lucky we're blood, lol. On a side note I am going to Joo's house tomorrow, and spending the night. I'm gonna be reading BTP most of hte time so it should be shwayt. ok I'm out talk to you ALL later hopefully lol
