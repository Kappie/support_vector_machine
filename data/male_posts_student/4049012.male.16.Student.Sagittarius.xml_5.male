Well, for one, there's the bastards who constantly tell me about their boyfriend/girlfriend/gerbil. Now, I'm sure most people wouldn't care about that. It might even be a tad annoying. But, no. I am jealous. And if that makes me insecure or as shallow as anyone else, then so be it. I have a low tolerance for shit, so you see my problem. I don't need to hear how happy Mr. X is with Ms. X, or vice versa. I'm happy for them, I'm just not happy about being subjected to every little menial happening in their lives. I don't care. You're a bunch of stupid, shallow, small-minded teenagers who think the world of each other. Tell someone else how tight Ms. X is, but don't ever fucking tell me again. Sorry is it's "elitist" or what have you, but lately, I'm just not in a good place. So it'd be better, if any of you who actually talk to me, to just keep it basic, and avoid the aforementioned.  See, the anxiety itself isn't so bad, but when it's exacerbated by shit, I become...well...depressed. So please, if you feel the need to exclaim powerfully about your little affair, do it elsewhere. Perhaps pick up a " urlLink livejournal " and do it there.  Thanks.
