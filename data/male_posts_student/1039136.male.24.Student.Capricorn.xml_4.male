I've seen or have been in nearly every category of relationship...I'm old..and wise... All men are assholes, or psycho, or possesive. All women are bitches, or crazy, or clingy. FACE THE FACTS PEOPLE...no one is perfect... You never will find someone that is perfect, but rather you should be trying to find someone perfect for you...aka YOUR TYPE.. The trick here is..look at yourself..figure out whats wrong with you, because people, we're humans, find out what your biggest relationship flaw is, face the facts, talk to the exes..talk to your friends that are bluntly honest with you.. WHATS WRONG WITH YOU...if anyone says.."nothing" theyre nothing but lying ass kissers...theres something wrong with every one of us.  Now once you've swallowed your pride you should first seek a PERSONALITY in a person of the opposite sex that seems to match with your flaws..using the above flaws as an example...possessive guys and clingy girls are a good match, whereas an independant guy and an independant girl are sure to fail.. Now GIRLS AND GUYS, we all know that looks are a major factor..but personality FIRST...find compatability, then look at what thet look like..theres nothing wrong with having physical taste...some guys are breast men, some girls like really big dicks, whatever...All of us, both guys and girls have their tastes, don't deny it. You have to get to really know the person as well, figure out what you like about the other person, but more importantly what you DISLIKE about the person...if what pisses you off about him/her isnt that big of a deal where you can blow it off and it not be a major emotional trauma for you, youre in good shape! Otherwise, fuck it..you can try and try and try and it will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever (takes breath) ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever... work..if it doesnt work with someone, its not a crime, youre JUST INCOMPATIBLE, get over it...move on  I've been in this spot before, and IT SUCKS, but suck it up, life goes on.. Remeber, this life is YOUR life, and you DESERVE to be happy. If youre not with someone who will make you happy, dont start all that whiny self esteem shit, just get over it. You will find someone in time...that is if you stop concentrating on the one person you arent going to work with.  Relationship people, the key is COMPATABILITY, embed that in your skulls..COMPATABILITY...you need to be paired with someone who you can deal with PERIOD.  Ooo and onto the single people...yeah the single life is fun...some girls/guys like being players, some girls/guys like being single, some girls/guys are afraid of being hurt, well join the fucking rest of the world. If someone comes along and you feel you are COMPATABLE with them, fuck it, take a shot, whats there to lose at most, a few months?? wow..big fucking deal..you have roughly 960 months in a life time, you have a few to spare..remember relationships provide somethings the single life cant, and NO NOT SOMEONE TO DO ALL THE TIME..well yeah..thats a given but..good relationships provide a feeling that you cant ever ever ever recreate with anything else...some call it LOVE...ya know..that thing you tell that guy/girl so they will do you? yeah well when it REALLY happens, you'll know it. And also, you single fucks(this includes me), DONT LOOK FOR SOMEONE...you pathetic fucks, the more desperate you look, the worse off you are..yeah..SOMETIMES it gets lonely, but thats life...stop thinking the grass is greener on the other side..and don't rush into anything..be you and enjoy life  Guys/Girls its a rough world...someone somewhere will like you for you, its your life...Remember:compatablity is key to happiness in relationships...if youre single..living life for the sake of living is key. REMEMBER: ITS YOUR LIFE..YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY, live it up mother fuckers..and read this Bon Jovi - It's My Life  This ain't a song for the broken-hearted  No silent prayer for the faith-departed  I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd  You're gonna hear my voice  When I shout it out loud   Chorus:  It's my life  It's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just wanna live while I'm alive  It's my life   This is for the ones who stood their ground  For Tommy and Gina who never backed down  Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake  Luck ain't even lucky  Got to make your own breaks   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive  'Cause it's my life   Better stand tall when they're calling you out  Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive  'Cause it's my life!
