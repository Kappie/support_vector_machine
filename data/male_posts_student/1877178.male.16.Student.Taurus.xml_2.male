And I will let you go out on Friday and Saturday.   Sister:    Mom that not fair! I am never around, and if I am, I am never with you.   Mom:    Thats why you need to stay home and spend time with us.   Sister:    THATS NOT FAIR! ERRRRR   Mom:    Well I don't care   Sister:    ERRRAAAA! (stomping up the stairs*)
