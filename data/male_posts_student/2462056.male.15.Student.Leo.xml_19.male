I went to Chewacla today with Jesse and his mom and sister, and we swam for almost 5 hours straight... so I'm totally tired...  We swam across the whole thing, it was fun.  Then we jumped around on the big rocks and stuff, which was really fun.  Then I came home... sat around for a little bit.  Me and my brother watched like, 3 hours of South Park tonight, which was fun (he just left a little while ago).  Ah.... Smartees are so good.  Yesterday I saw I, Robot, which is a lot better than I thought it was going to be!  Then I went to the park with a group of people, and it was fun.  We played hide and seek, hehe, then we kicked around the soccer ball for a while.  Around 7:30 everyone went to Jordan's house, but I didn't because I went home because my brother and my cousin came over and ate dinner.  Then we had a wicked game of clue afterwards... hahaha.  So yeah... hmmm.. Claire gets back on Saturday! I'm so excited!
