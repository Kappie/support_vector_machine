From then onwards, I am more or less 'free for academic oppurtunities'.  The time and venue can be decided. Most probably school seems the best fit, you know something like after school, or Barista also works out. Depending on the audience ofcourse.  Preferable if students can bring laptops. Hmm.. I guess this is asking too much.  Anyway, post comments to this post for any more information.
