Bob Sendall, my mom's friend, got some bad directions and we ended up milling around the countryside in his SUV (ironic: he's a liberal, Bush-hating sort of person) for about an hour before stopping for directions at some golf range named "Bob's Links," or something, that was in the middle of nowhere. It took a guy at the bar five whole minutes to remember where the place was.  Now, I admit that the food was great: all the people invited were somehow affiliated with the food industry, and the main attraction, the lamb, is supposed to be the  urlLink best lamb  in the United States. So yeah, that was good.  Except I didn't know anyone there, and it was just really boring and not worth it. It could have been nicer, if we had come earlier.  -----  OK, my Math and Biology finals are whispering to me like the sirens calling Odysseus to his doom upon the rocks. I bid you all farewell.
