MSA had three teams there, and considering we're a small school, thats quite a feat. And by the way, I got up at 6 on Saturday. I got home at 8, majorly exhausted. I didn't have enough energy to stomach the vegetable dish my dad made, so I had good ol' pizza...again. What a day, and damn it was fun. Hehe  Then Sunday, I was late to the Darksteel Pre-release, causing me to wait 4 hours until the next tournament started. It wasn't so bad, since I wasn't the only one late. I got up at 8 Sunday, and I got home around 7. Luckily I had no homework. Well...there was that science I didn't do...  Then of course, the wakeup call the next morning coming in the form of an obnoxious, ear-splitting beep. Jazz band was canceled today due to the weather, which was a nice benefit of all this snow. I've got a bit of homework tonight, so that helped. Also, I won't be going to my drum lesson tonight, yet another plus. I want to take someone to the Ice Palace this weekend too...hmmm....  That bastard still hasn't gotten the shipment of Mirrodin boxes, which does contain mine, in yet. It's getting me really pissed too-I ordered it on the 29th of December! *sue for mail fraud...*  Well, I'm off to actually get my homework done, and listen to music of course.  See ya'll lata, Bren
