Well, thats because I dont have much to blog about on the TEW, mostly on my own personal blog...  So, how is the weather people? Where we are it is BLAZZZZZZZZZZZZZING hot! At least it is a dry heat and not this hot and humid heat like in Vietnam (check my PERSONAL blog about that later)...  Yep, I will blog on here in a bit...  Stay tuned right after this government-issued-commercial-break!
