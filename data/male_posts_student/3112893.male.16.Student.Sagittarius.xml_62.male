January 29th, 2004  The Random Ranting of Old  Mother Dearest yelling and crying and whining over a site that was down but gave obscure error messages  My mom was looking for a job and in her search she found out about surveys that you could take online for which you would be financially compensated. So she looks around the web to find some sites that offer this service and shortly after starting, finds one that she likes. She looked around the page to see how she would get the money after taking the survey and she was totally fine with it so she clicked on the thing to sign up.  There are three ways to pay the one-time $35 down that you have to pay to use the service. This is where it gets ugly. She first decided that she wants to do it through PayPal but was unable because she forgot her password. So she decided to pick another option that was labeled "pay with credit card or check online." She clicked the link and filled in her state and zip code... (and here's where it gets good) She clicks the continue button and (BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUUUUMMM) IT DOESN'T WORK!!  "HOLY FUCKIN' SHIT!! A SITE WITH A FORM THAT DOESN'T WORK!! WHA HO HOOO!! THIS IS REALLY FRIGGIN' HEAVY STUFF!" my mom must be thinking to herself as she starts getting mad at the site and doing the same thing to it over and over and over again. So she asks me what's wrong after several attempts at fixing it  the same way over and over again. I suggest that the site that's responsible for payment may be down or they're doing maintenance. This seems reasonable enough to her so she waits... and she waits... and she waits... for a whole 5 minutes. And she tries again and it still doesn't work. She does this twice again and finally cracks.  She unleashed fury of which even Melkor would have been afraid and she cursed IllÃºvatar and told Tolkien to shove his gods up his ass and that god was not on her side. And then she changed her rants to a whole different subject. That of her cookies, for which she had thought she had a perfect recipe (and she did). Here's the thing, it's not like the recipe she used the first time didn't pan out. She changed it and then ranted as if her old cookies failed! She went on for like 10 minutes doing this. I amazingly managed to keep my mouth shut.  The moral of this story is that my mother needs to grow up and smell the withering tulips because life is not a rose garden in which all things are perfect and will always go your way no matter what you do. LORD, save her please. And if not her from her ignorance, save me from being subject to it :-P. >> meowMix  January 30th, 2004  Better Late Than Never  This is a log of the 29th of January that I forget to put together at the end of the day. I will be writing the message as if I were doing it last night. I met the lady with whom I'll be working at UCLA.  Well, today I woke up at at the ungodly hour of 5:45AM to go to the UCLA volunteer orientation and to meet some people for whom I will be working. I got out of bed at 6:15 to find that The Postal Service was playing. I knew that I had turned it off last night so I thought it had to be my mom or sister, AND IT WAS! My mom said that I had gotten her used to listening to music in the morning and she was so used to hearing them in the morning that it felt quiet without it. I feel special.  At 6:45 we left for my uncle's place so that we could go to UCLA together an on the way he gave me a talk about how to hold myself and behave. I had no problem with this and was, in fact, thankful that he pointed out a few things. While at UCLA I checked at the volunteer office to see if I had to fill anything out only to find out that the orientation was cancelled.  After finding out about this, I was very disappointed but helped Babak set up, clean up, and while he was working on his first patient I called my mom to see if she could spend an hour in Westwood with me. She said that it's take a while to get to UCLA from where she was so I spent that time downstairs looking through the BioMed Library. I found some journals on Diabetes that were cool but I didn't understand them.  It was about 10:20 when my mom finally showed up and we went to get some food at In-N-Out. We also picked up a salad for Babak at Corner's Bakery. When we were done eating, it was about 11:20AM so my mom took me back to UCLA. I went see if Babak was done and he wasn't so I went down to the BioMed Library again and found a really cool journal called "Evolution and Human Behavior."  After Babak was done with his first patient we met up and he introduced me to Dr. Younai who is for whom I will be working. She's a nice lady but I was very nervous and so I stayed quiet most of the time. I'd like to think I left a good impression though.  After meeting with Dr. Younai, Babak had an Endo (Root Canal) patient and I didn't have much interesting in watching (aside from the fact that the professor who was there at the time didn't like anyone watching anyway) so I called my mom again and she picked me up.  After getting home I didn't do much more than play SC and talk online. I really hate it when that happens and want to stop :-(.  Overall I think this was a good day and hope that more days can be more like this. 	>> meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.  That is all. -- Feanor
