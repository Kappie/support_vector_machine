I went on that voyage to figure out what I wanted from myself, life, relationships; to think about the kind of person I want to become. In retrospect, this trip did teach me about what I  don't  want to become: a carbon copy of my old persona.    To deny ones self of emotions will only bring heartache. And it has. That's why I'm here. Not to clear my own conscience, but to give explanations to someone who deserves them.  People keep asking me whatI "am" so here is a repost:  urlLink http://robastia.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_robastia_archive.html
