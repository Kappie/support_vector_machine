It is a tired but true cliche that in Hollywood, all movies must be pitched in terms of other movies.  Things are always described as a mating of two or three other concepts in order to get the suits to understand the concept in under eight seconds.  Well, this review is a good example.     "King Arthur" was directed by Antoine Fuqua, and resembles his earlier film "Training Day" in the visceral, gritty nature of its battles. It was written by David Franzoni, and resembles his earlier film "Gladiator" in its manly-manness and its obsession for historical lore.  ...  If "King Arthur" brings to mind any previous film that Bruckheimer produced, it's "Black Hawk Down." Both share the same cinematographer, Slawomir Idziak, and at times share a similarly bleached-out, grainy look.   ...  But Knightley continues to prove herself a versatile young actress: She can do comedy ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"), she can do romance ("Love Actually"), she can be young and fresh in a girl power movie ("Bend It Like Beckham").   ...  Winstone, so excellent in "Sexy Beast," here provides sporadic, much-needed comic relief as a knight whose girlfriend has given birth to so many of their children, they've assigned them numbers rather than names.  ...  And Owen, so suave in the excellent noir hit "Croupier," provides weight, intelligence and heroism to go along with his dark good looks.   OK, maybe it is only funny to me.  But reviews like this make me long for the days of  urlLink Paul Tatara.   And speaking of Tatara, here's a good  urlLink interview  of the funniest reviewer ever to work at CNN.  In case you haven't heard of him, here's a  urlLink classic .  Obviously, some else is enough of a fan to provide  urlLink this .
