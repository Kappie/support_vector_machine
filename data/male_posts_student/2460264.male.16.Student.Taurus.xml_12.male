Very boring, and I'm really tired because I always end up going to bed late even though I'll tell myself I need to go to bed early. Don't lose sight of what's important because when you do, it's hard to come back to that and focus on it. At least for me, I kind of blew off school for a while and now it's really hard to get back into the swing of things. I mean it happens, but it's becoming a pretty heavy responsibility. Not just school though, this can apply to anything. On a kind of happier note, I'm going over to Jordan's with Rich to record vocals. Hanging out with the cool kids...   Alright, I'm going to do a little something, something to make this a little more interesting...  Finish this sentence: The worst thing about ______ is _______. email me your answer and you might win something and I'll tell you my answer.
