I don't have any angst at all, and if you looked at the poem you would see that; instead of just saying "creepy."  There's a story behind it, all you have to do is look at it.  So here it is again:  PAIN  I feel it, the pain, it's running down my side. The blackness, the bane coming forth to consume me. Little voices in my head are driving me insane, always urging me: "do it, do it." Like little drops of rancid rain they fill me up inside. I swirl and swell without a drain, my seams will surely break. It is only I who know it though, it's entirely my strain; My outsides show no signs of grief. Therin lies the problem, I'm not a child plain. Why should someone help me, a child with a brain? Will I float or will I sink, when my sorrows fill the brim? When the vein pops I'll be slain only if it pleases Him.  I've decided to give out some awards.  Most like myself: Josh H. or John V. Most Spontaneous: Josh M. Coolest kid on the block: Bryce O. Slowest kid around: Jeff S. Most likely to kill a friend because of constant harassment about Pammy: John V.  The final note: I need to find a way to play Halo, or at least a way to get training for it.  Next weekend looks open for me so...
