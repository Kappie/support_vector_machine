I dreamt that I got married to this girl. It was kind of a rushed thing and I guess I didn't really think about it a whole lot. But then all of a sudden we were married. It was done. And then I started thinking that I didn't really want to be married to her. It was a horrible feeling. I felt so trapped! I felt like I had messed up and there was nothing I could do about it... it was so final. Wow. What a huge relief when I woke up and realized that it was just a dream. Does this dream mean something? Do you think it reveals something about what I think deep down? Am I really scared of marriage and don't even realize it or admit it to myself? Am Iafraid that I will messup and marry someone that I end up not wanting to be with?I don't know. Maybe it was just a dream?  So I was walking to work just before noon and I saw this guy walking across campus and talking on his cell phone with the antenna up. I don't know why, but that is one of my pet peeves. It totally bugs me when people stick the antenna of their cell phone up. Does it really do anything? I seriously doubt it. I think they just look stupid. Now I don't want to speak to harshly because I know my Mom used to pull her antenna out, and she would feel really bad if she read this. But she has a new phone now, one that doesn't have an antenna you can pull out. So she's good now. Anyway, just leave the antennae alone people.   Work was fine today. There are certain people that come to the library and use the computers every day. I can't figure out what they are doing. No joke. This one guy was there today from 10:30 a.m. until about 6:45 p.m. That is not normal! These people aren't students either. It isn't like they are working on research papers or anything like that. They are older people that don't even have logins, so they just have to use the public access computers. I just can't understand how someone earns a living when they are sitting on computer at the library all day, every day.   After work I came home and went running. I went 5 miles in the rain, wind, lightning and thunder. It was pretty fun. There was some beautiful lightning while I was out there. I was actually getting kind of scared that I was going to get hit, but I just kept going. I've got a marathon to train for here!   Tomorrow we have no classes for pioneer day. Some of my friends and I are going to hike Mount Timpanogos in the morning. We're meeting at 5:30 a.m., so I should probably get to bed. I'll probably have some pictures to show from our hike tomorrow.
