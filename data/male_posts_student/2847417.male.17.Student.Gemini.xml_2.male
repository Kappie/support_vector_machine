This is- not including my blog/websites- probably the 15th or 20th blog I've started. However, unlike all the previous weblogs, I have began a mission to soak up all the info I can on web design and programming through other people's blogs.        urlLink Authentic Boredom  by Cameron Moll      urlLink A List Apart  by various authors      urlLink Youngpup  by Aaron Boodman    Although those are just three that I have frequently read over the past weeks, there are many more, but for now the main purpose of this post is to inform you on what will be coming- and see this template by  urlLink Jeffrey Zeldman  that is default until I get my act together with a school project and friend's band website.     A Purpose, A Goal, A Passions   (I hope)   For now the main intent of this blog is to track my trail as I begin my road to predition- er, excuse me- full fledged web designer and web programmer. The programing idea seems to fit my mathmatical talent more; yet I have failed to initiate a step by step process to learn a language. The web design side of things apeases my eyes more, but I am no artist, yet I still try and come up short miserably.    No worries, as a camp counsouler once said, "You'll bounce back!" And indeed I have! Once I finish the touches on my school's website and get rolling back in school within the next month, I'll take to an independant class solely focused on Javascript. From there I plan on presuing PHP and dive into some hefty reading on web design.    Until I return from vacation- to all a goodnight and to all a good blessing.
