Todays topic of discussion (by me) on Lets see...Music!!! Music is the best thing going, as long as you listen top the right kind of music. So, if you're listening to rap, Don't. Listen to something where it is possibe for the artists to actually be artists and create something that took talent, not something where they gave a retard a rhyming dictionary. So if you find this uninteresting, come back and I'll lambast you for being an idiot. Now carry on with your worthless days.
