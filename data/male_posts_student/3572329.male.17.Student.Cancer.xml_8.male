I feel yucky now, both physically  and  emotionally.  I've been doing random things to keep my mind off of everything but it's not really working.     Jamie modded his case with a fiberglass window and a red cathode.  He also drilled some holes in the fiberglass for 2 more fans.  It's actually pretty cool.  He overclocked his processor to 2.8 Ghz, a pretty decent increase.  Classical music is really good to calm down with.  Every note played is really beautiful.  Yeah, I'm weird.  Deal with it.  Writing is making me feel better so I'm just gonna keep rambling, lucky you.  I cannot wait for school to be over with, I can't wait to sleep in.  I'm actually really feeling better now that I'm getting this all out.  I'd appreciate it if the comments be kept (mostly) serious.  Yeah.  Thank you for being my friend.  Later.
