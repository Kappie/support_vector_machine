I was reading video game reviews when I found this review of halo 2. Check out the spelling and grammar.  PEOPLE CALM DOWN......... This game will blow, why? Because its like future and stupid stuff like ugly guns and all that. I dont care what u think about my review. But this is my opinion.... I thick this game wont be a big dial. I thick rainbow six 3 its a big dial. Its real like in real live. And halo its just mosthers and laser so fake.........dont like it...........i mean why would u buy a game that its borring like that. Just because its a new game it doesn't mean evert one will go crazy about it from 1 to 5 ill give it a 11111 it blow.........sucks. Make games that are in the present, not the future.....not proded....
