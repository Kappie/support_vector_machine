With Clinton in office: For fiscal year 1999, the federal budget  surplus  was $122.7 billion.  urlLink Proof   With Bush in office: For fiscal year 2004, the annual federal budget  deficit  is $639 billion, [...] a near-record level for the post-World War II era.  urlLink Proof   According to the U.S. National Debt Clock, right now, Outstanding Public Debt is $7,295,929,465,739.86. Still, that number is not quite accurate because, in the time it took me to type this large number, the Deficit has already grown. It's impossible to keep up with.
