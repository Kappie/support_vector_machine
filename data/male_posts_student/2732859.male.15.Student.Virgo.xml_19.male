Anyway, the world is still falling apart and Bush and Kerry are dead even in the polls.  What is this business about Kerry's war medals and whether they were medals or ribbons that he threw in DC 30 years ago and whether he deserved them or not?  How can the Bush people even talk about this?  Kerry isn't handling this well though.  He should probably ask the President to show the country his medals from Vietnam.  Oh yeah, he doesn't have any because he didn't even show up to the national guard.  Maybe if Bush had served he would know about Medals and ribbons.  This just shows that Bush can't run on the issues and has to go on what Kerry threw in 1971.        I'm also very angry about the flip- flop issue.  Both Bush and Kerry have flip- flops.  In the '70s, when Bush ran for Congress, he was pro- choice.  In 2000, he said he was against "nation building" and what is he doing now?  He was also against the Department of Homeland Security, and has opposed funding for anti- terrorism measures.  The Democratic Party is THE Party of National Security and they should really expose the Republicans for who they really are.  I am so mad today, I feel like Howard Dean!!!!  PS-   Oh, I have a new catchphrase, Clinton screwed an intern, but Bush screwed America.
