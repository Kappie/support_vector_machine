ANDREW GOT A NEW SKATEBOARD. HOW FUCKED IS THAT. I need a new bike cause mine doesnt ahve breaks! and he alreayd has 200 boards!@ So i was so fucking pissed i threw shit at my walls and punched a hole in a wall ( i have a poster over it now ) so yeah i was fuckin PO'd and then i was ready to cut the damn skateboard in half but i knew id get in trouble so i retained myself. and then my mom ordered the books im gonna need to read over the summer. god i hate reading and then im here with steve and hes sleepin over. then i gotta get up for worl tommorow...god this sucks. julz is going to maryland till Sunday but i ant worried this time lol. so see ya later
