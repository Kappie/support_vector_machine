Instead I was over a friends house practicing and watching his mom and a kid fight and curse at each other. Very funny none the less. Saturday. Boring day. Nothing really happened Saturday except I went to Church which really isn't too exciting anyway. So Saturday was pretty much a waste. I look forward to the weekends so much but then when I do have some free time to do things I never do. Um I would reword that last sentence but I'm too lazy. Sunday. Today I was home alone and just like Saturday did nothing at all. Watched football, ate, laid down, repeat. I really need to move out of this wasteland. Hazleton is nothing but a collection of rain, sewage, ugly cars, and white people acting black. I wonder if other cities are populated with as many wanna-be-thugs as here in Hazleton. I sure hope not. Well I think I'll end this post now.
