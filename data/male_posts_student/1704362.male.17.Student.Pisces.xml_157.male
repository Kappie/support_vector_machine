Anyway, here's the inner monologue:  A  cot(x)sin(x)/sec(x) A  (cos(x)/sin(x))sin(x)/(1/cos(x)) A  cos(x)sin(x)/sin(x)/(1/cos(x)) A  cos(x)/(1/cos(x)) A  cos^2(x)/1 A  Ah, cos^2(x). A  I dig through my mind. BIFURICATE B  That's not a good metaphor. A  I don't think there is a good metaphor. B  Well, if there's not a good metaphor, it's not worth expressing. A  That's stupid. What was I saying? B  You like to dig through our mind, that's what's stupid. BIFURICATE C  Maybe he likes to channel-surf through our mind. A  Shut up. B  Shut up. C  Sorry. A  Okay, I thought of one. B  I hope it's not as stupid as the last one. C  What, the digging? B  Yeah. C  Oh. A  My mind is like a tree. B  That's trite. C  I like it. B  How can you possibly like it? C  He's talking about all the bifurication. C  I'd say it's more like a tree getting struck by lightning. B  Or a tree going through a wood chipper from the top down. B  Maybe a metaphor isn't the best way of going about this. A  Why do you say that? B  Because you're wasting our time thinking about wood chippers. A  Hey, that's you thinking about it, not me. B  It's my time, too. A  Oh, right. C  Why is your mind like a tree? A  Because, I can't follow a train of thought to its end point. C  Oh, the branching? BIFURICATE D  Shouldn't you be working on your exam? A  Case in point. C  Gotcha. A  Oh. A  OH. Shit. B  Nuts to this. Bye. MERGE C  Have fun. MERGE A  Where was I?  I mark down answer "cos^2(x)" and continue. This is why I need to remember to take my medication before testing.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.ikissyou.org/famous_site/famous_site.html
