Woke up late do lots of cleaning... still gotta clean my room.. sigh... my cats have satisfied tummies and napping right now..  Listening to Elton John's Im still standing right now...   Having this blog made me realise how computer illiterate I am... and best of all I dont borther.. Never really a computer person..  Life with straight hair has never been better.... It will be a long time before i turn back to curls again... and the thing is that i miss combing my hair.  Chatted with Sufian today... talking to him make me miss school alot and Yishun. I feel that Yishun was more of a home to me, eg, went to watch movie yesterday with Nas.. Whole Ten Yards... yeah totally in love with Mr Matthew Perry... I walk ard Yishun saw lots of familiar faces and it was more like " balik kampong" u noe,.... But whatever it is its not home anymore. Life has to go on...  Actually Im very nervous about going for op this Friday....
