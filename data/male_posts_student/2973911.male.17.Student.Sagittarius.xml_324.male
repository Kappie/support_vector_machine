If you'd read any of mine during my dark hours, you'd run for your life. *evil laugh* *delete evil laugh* *evil cackle* ^^  Pero we really can't help having regrets with our lives because there is always an opportunity cose. Oops! Sorry, commerce talk. There's just one other thing we never really did and we can't help but say 'what if?' Pero parte pa rin iyon ng buhay and if we did change that part of out life, we would be so much more different than we are now and would you really have wanted to change yourself?
