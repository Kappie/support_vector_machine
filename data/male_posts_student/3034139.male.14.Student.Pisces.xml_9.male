He's red and he lives in a small tank in my bedroom. I've already had to clean his tank once because he poops a lot. Mom helped me do it. He eats a lot and he likes to push the rocks around in the tank.  We learnt a new note for the recorder - a. Now I know another song. It is the B and A Blues.  I've been teaching some other kids how to do PowerPoint in Computers. It's really easy and I like the things you can do with it.  I started a new research project. My friend and I are doing a presentation on Texas and the Alamo. My friend has been there before. We went to the library yesterday to start our research on it.  That's All Folks!
