I've grabbed them from Strongbad's emails and I still got a few to go through. I've also documenter each email from sbemail.html to sbemail106.html describing the main events.. all this has taken me about 3 days.. ehh  Also about the engine - I've decided to use AGS (Adventure Game Studio -  urlLink www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk ) since it's free and has the functions I need for the game. The problem is, that I'm running OS X on a Mac so I have to run AGS either under Win98 on Virtual PC or on a shared household PC. Bit of a hassle since AGS doesn't run that smooth on my Virtual PC. I've pretty much taught myself how to use AGS with the help of the tutorials (Thanks to the guys who wrote them!) thought I'll probably need some additional help in the future with advanced scripting.  I've also put together a story framework with start and beginning and various bits in the middle, just need to develop it and tie it with the available graphics I have (and will have later). I have to keep in mind that I'm bound by the graphics I can aquire from www.homestarrunner.com since I don't think Brothers Chaps will make me any graphics if I asked them.  Also, I've started creating a mindmap of the game with FreeMind ( urlLink http://freemind.sourceforge.net/ ), absolutely wikkid progam, Java-based so runs on multiple platforms. I've started entering all the available rooms as archives so I know what I can use.. I'll later add all the other info, such as objects, character graphics and animation, etc.. Oh yeah! One thing, FreeMind lets you export the data as HTML, so I can put the whole game mindmap online, once I've got it to some decent stage..  One more thing, I am aware as you might have thought, 'what about copyright?' - Well I've decided that once I have couple basic playable rooms together I will contact Brothers Chaps and ask what they think of it. If they say no, I have to reconsider finishing the game, but if they are interested in releasing the game as a fan prod, I'll try to get some more people behind it and get Brothers Chaps support behind it! Thet would be just swell... ;)  Whoa, that was a long post, mainly because it's the first one with any real info.. the future ones will probably be a lot shorter.  'Until next week.. or day!'
