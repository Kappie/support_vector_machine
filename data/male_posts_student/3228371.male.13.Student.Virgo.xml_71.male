Blah, whatever.   Guitar class was a lot of fun. We did different songs and sounded great! My mom's considering getting me an electric guitar  amplifier in the summer. We're gonna do a garage sale and then I'll get most of the money from what we sell since I'm PROBABLY gonna organize it... maybe. We're probably combining with Rachel too so yeah. Well, it's not that I'm gonna get most of the money from what my family makes but it's probably gonna go towards paying for my guitar. Hopefully. Gotta be a good girl and show mommy that I deserve an electric guitar and amplifier. Hee hee~ I'm probably gonna save up a little too. I really wannit badly, as you can all see... or read. Haha~! Wow, Nathan and Caleb did REALLY well in guitar class today. They've totally mastered the fingerboard! Awesomeness! I'm on my way though. I didn't practise but did a lot better than last time so yeah. I'm totally getting the hang of the riffs. I understand how to pick/finger the chords instead of just strumming, which in some cases sound better... like "POWER OF YOUR LOVE". Total harmony among us. Yayness.   Anyway... Guess what? I saw this really cool dress on http://www.promgirl.com! It's called "COOL SHOULDER". Almost $300! Expensiveness! But I totally love it! I'm OBSESSED! Too bad I've already got TWO grad dresses, otherwise, I'd totally order it online! Too bad it only comes in white and light blue. I wanted it in black. Plus, it's got matching shoes that you can buy additionally. Too bad, I can't get it... maybe I'll get it when it's time for my grade 12 prom! Haha~! But it'll probably be ancient and out by then. *sighzZ* Whatever.  Shopping on Saturday. I'm sure I've mentioned that in my blog previously. I really hope Nima can come. I want a guy's perspective on the stuff I try on. I mean, girlfriends are great to shop with but if they can tell that you really like that outfit even though it looks horrible on you, they'd say: "Oh wow! It looks great!" just so they won't hurt your feelings. But I want a GUY'S perspective on things. Plus, I don't want ANY guy's perspective, I want NIMA's perspective. If I wanted ANY guy's perspective, I would've brought ANY guy with me! But I don't think I dress nicely for guys, I dress nicely for Nima. 'Cos I want to look good for HIM, not other guys! Capiche? Anyways... so yeah. I really hope he can come. I don't want to have to drag some guy randomly from the food court to give me his opinion on the tops I try on, which will most likely be spaghetti strap tops 'cos that's mainly what I'm shopping for on Saturday. Anyway... I should go now... gotta take another shower before going to bed... I'm all sticky... so hot. >O
