Talk about a lazy ass huh? Anyway I woke up around 12 PM, sat around on the internet, made myself French toast, and did some cleaning. So it wasn't a total lack of productivity.  My plan is to get 2 papers done this weekend - the reading paper and the constitution paper. 6 pages shouldn't be that hard to get done in 2 days right? That leaves me next week to get my world systems paper and a good chunk of my research paper done next week. Then the following week, I should be able to get my research paper done. That's my plan.  In rotation right now is  Skid Row  and the  Strokes .   ***
