There are a few pluses to this trip as compared to the last trip.  For one, its in the states which means quite a few things.  1) No GAY ASS customs/border patrol 2) My cell phone will work and 3) Again, not gone as long.  Not that im not looking forward to it because again I love to camp and this will be a great experience for me (maybe even see a bear!!)  Hey, it happend last year...so yeah, this trip wont be AS awesome..well, weathher wise it will be but i dunno...its gonna be fun no doubt.  I guess Im just tired of traveling and kinda just wanna stay home.    So I guess I will talk a little about England here since I havent mentioned it at all in here since I got home.  As youve prolly heard it was AWESOME and yeah, thats all I can say about it.  Totally great to see a TOTALLY different side of the world and totally different country.  I would recomend going there to see things for ANYONE but never go there to live...way too expensive.  Plus they are little weirdos and drive on the left side of the road and use currency that is worth TWICE as much as American money. lol so yeah, great trip.  Website is up if you havent already heard with a lot of my photos from the trip.  Took me 2 days to get it up so have a look.  Link is in my profile but in case you cant get it there here it is again.  http://behindbritain.blogspot.com/  Since I got home its been really great to see a lot of yall.  I know I havent seen many of you but today and tommorow I have plans to see a lot of the people I havent seen already.  Saw The Notebook yesterday with Meeta and it was SO good!  We had a very good time yesterday except for one incident which we cleared up pretty quickly so yesterday was good =).   Also played hockey yesterday for the first time in a month which KILLED me cause we skated for a hour and a half.  Was so sore...ugh, and left me broke too.  Still have yet to see Spidey Man and prolly wont get around to it till after I get back from Colorado.  Unless I see it tonight... Alright well I guess Im gonna end this.  I will prolly write later tonight if enough happens to make it a good entry.  Aight, im out.
