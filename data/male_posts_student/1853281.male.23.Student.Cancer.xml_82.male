I am suprised. had so weird intense stuff happen this weekend, totally lost my balance for a while(for the full story give me a call, and if i know you well enough i will dish) than collapsed with something flulike, but now i am doing better, and i feel good. Oh, and i have lost 8 lbs since last tuesday...what is that? Must have been total bloatron. Anyways. so far in the weightloss competition with the rents i am seven pounds ahead. Oh yeah. Give me some competition and i will do anything to win!!! e-mail me talk to me love me, i am in a good mood. cheers d
