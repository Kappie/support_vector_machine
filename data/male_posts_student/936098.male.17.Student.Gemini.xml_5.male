We heard the word "corazon" (heart) in a song, and we both noticed it. I always point out how much they use that word in Mexican songs. Then, a Dr. Pepper commercial came on. (El sabor de la originalidad?) Somehow, they managed to say "corazon" in the Dr. Pepper commercial too. Then, on the way home, I left it on and I heard another song with "corazon" in it. Three in a row.  A pretty extreme storm happened lastnight, and I would blog about it but right now I'm going to clean my room. I just though that "originalidad" was definitely worth mentioning briefly.
