Then I put my swimsuit on and headed to Hardees this mornin for breakfast and ate a bacon,egg,and cheese biscuit, then I headed off to work. It rained some during my shift, but it was fun swimmin in the rain durin work since nobody was there. Then it cleared off. After I got off work it was so nice that I stayed and swam until 5:30. After that I came home and took ashower. Then I talked to friends online. I got inturrupted by dinner, but of course I didnt mind. Thats all for now, have a great evening. Love always.
