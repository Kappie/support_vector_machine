I became even more horrified when I heard how he was decapitated; a thick knife through the right side of his neck, and then the left in the midst of his screaming.    What really got me, though, was a picture of Nick's dad and brother on the front lawn, crying.    But when I was finding more stuff about Nick, I found tons of articles stating his decapitation is a fraud.  Here's what I've found so far:    MILITARY BEHIND THIS?   There are alot of suspicious dates that have been lied by the U.S. Military.  Many sources say that the "Beheading of Nick Berg" is nothing more than an attempt to swerve attention away from the naked photos of Iraqis.       Descrepancies- Here is a quote:   "Berg's last known whereabouts was in U.S. custody. On April 1, Beth A. Payne, the U.S. consular officer in Iraq, sent an e-mail to the family of Nick Berg. It stated that Ms. Payne had located Nick, and he was currently in custody of the US military. She wrote, "I have confirmed that your son, Nick, is being detained by the U.S. military in Mosul. He is safe. He was picked up approximately one week ago. We will try to obtain additional information regarding his detention and a contact person you can communicate with directly. This is distinct from the next point... The US military has stated that Berg was never in US custody and that he had been in custody of the Iraqi police. The Iraqi police adamantly deny he was ever in their custody. (See again: The Unanswered Questions of Nick Berg's Murder.) If this is so, we have to conclude that either the email from Ms. Payne was incorrect or that the US military has been lying." -Break For News      Similiar- There are alot of pictures that have dragged attention to a white chair; both in the photo of Nick Berg in the hands of the "terrorists," and in the photo of the U.S. Military prison, Abu Ghraib.  In both photos, the wall colors are of the same hue.  And, in the video, you see a glimpse of a military hat and sweater.    Here is the article: http://aztlan.net/berg_abu_ghraib_video.htm.         THE VIDEO      Dates- The military reported they found Nick's body Monday, May 10th.  But the video itself is dated May 11th.       Dubbed- Screaming starts while Berg is not moving and before he is touched.  Here is a quote:   "Whatever the mismatch in the speaker and video, videotape cognoscenti have said the scream was amateurishly dubbed into the tape. The writer of this K5 article reviewed this issue closely: The screaming starts (at 4:31 - on the copy I viewed, not the time stamp) about 5 to 6 seconds before Berg is touched (at 4:36) and he is moved to his side. He is just sitting there like a lump. While the screaming commences for (1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 seconds), his head doesn't move and his mouth doesn't appear to move (though the tape is blurry), nor does he seem to be physically screaming at any time. Yet the audio plays a loud vigorous screaming. The exact same dubbed screaming continues after the long time jump and a bit of a time gap with silence and after some cutting on the head, during which Berg is not moving. This screaming seems clearly dubbed and is highly incongruous with Berg's lack of activity." -Break For News      Time Stamp- There is a big jump in the time stamp that goes from 2:44:40 to about 13:45:47.  The first time is when Nick is reading his statement, and the second one is when his head was held up.     The Time Itself- The time itself is in Military time, and not Arabic.     Different Men- The man who was doing the cutting, the one in all black, was not the same man who held up the head.  In the video, however, it shows the man who was doing the cutting to be the same man who picked up the head.  Obviously there is some descrepancies here.     Sneakers?- This one is more funny than credible.  There's one guy in the video wearing white tennis sneakers; and these are supposedly terrorists?     OTHER EVIDENCE   There's to much to type, so here's another quote:   "Berg shown in video wearing orange jumpsuit known to be of U.S. issue. The orange jump suit "appears" to be identical to the jumpsuits used at Guantanamo. (Compare with pictures at Guantanamo.) The orange jumpsuit was standard US military issue to men in custody. It is unlikely Berg would continue wearing a U.S. custodial uniform if he had been released by the military as they claim. The fact he was still wearing the suit is both anomalous and suggestive. One wonders: Was there an immediate transfer of Berg from the US military to unknown persons, preventing Berg from discarding his US prison garb?   When Berg is decapitated, there was almost no blood. If Berg were still alive at this point, with the cut starting at front of throat, blood would have been spraying everywhere. Berg's severed head, the floor, Berg's clothes, and even the hand of the 'Arab' who decapitated Berg had no visible blood on it. When the executioner holds up Berg's head immediately following what is represented as an actual decapitation of a living person, there is no significant blood flow from the neck or blood splatters showing anywhere on the executioner.   Berg seems limp just before the beheading. It is not clear if he was moving after the time skip in the tape. While on the ground, Berg's body didn't seem move except in response to the captors movements. Although held down, Berg would have tried to instinctively wiggle and writhe away from captor's grip and use of a knife. (That is unless he was long dead after the cut in the tape.) A surgeon would very likely testify that the beheading did not cause the death.   The lack of spurting blood and lack of movement suggests Berg was already dead at the time of the alleged decapitation. During the beheading, Berg's eyes are not seen. Camera angle made it impossible to see if Berg's eyes were open or glassy. Berg very probably was killed before the staged beheading. Did the captors have no stomach for the beheading of a living person?"    CONCLUSION    To tell you the truth, I'm just as confused as anyone else is.  I really have no idea whether to believe Nick Berg was beheaded by the al-Qaida group, or the U.S. Military.  Maybe it's just my longing believe that there can't be people with absolutely no moral values at all.    I really hope this is all a fraud.  Not so I can bad mouth the Military, but so Nick Berg can come home.  But I think that's already to late, since we already have found his body.  But then the question remains, because he's already dead, who did it?  I think we owe it to Nick and the rest of the world, to find out for sure.
