That's quite a tough subject, unless you are very very informed of the music industry. Another contestant had a poor memory and did not remembered where his boards were. Oh meow!   Hmm... I didn't have much problems with my specs. I got comfortable with the vision thingy, no giddiness or anything. However, the two support-thingys that rests on my bridge of the nose actually made two marks on my nose. I think my specs are too tightly pressed to my nose le. Ergh.  Hmm...today I made 4 pages of my web! Weee.... at least I did something. HaHa. I am such a lazy cat.   Okay, today I was supposed to help MeiYing they all carry goods to Wendy's house. Take note of supposed. I did not help in the end. I can't leave the house and leave my brother all alone at home. Sigh...I can only offer directions to Wendy's house. They also said I will be delivering the food there too. I said I can't. My father is very annoyed that he has to scarifice his working hours (money-making time, to be exact) to fetch me there. I am not even sure he's fetching me back (How to take Wendy's christmas tree back? Never mind. I carry it on the train.). I can't demand more by telling him to pick up food at Wendy's house. Sigh... And hor, I don't know how I can manage to carry so MANY things down from my house to the cab. Have to make lotsa trips. Ben is helping, so is HuiMin (I think...). I think I am selfish by complaining. Just suddenly felt guilty for complaining so much. After all, I promised to help. I just never expected there're so many things lor. HaHa.  Hmm....I think that's all I have to say la. Darn. I haven't watched my recorded 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Daughter yet. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
