We had our DnT lesson after school and Mr.Fattah kept ranting and insulting some people..o.O Here comes the fun part : Social Studies Course... I kept seeing forward towards that course..and it's the last lesson...and guess what? IT'S QUIZ TIME!!! Though we were short of 3 people for a team ( it consists of 6 people actually ), we managed to tear and rip the opponents apart.. We won the quiz and we were rewarded a packet of Mars Bars..hmm..not too shabby for a day's work!
