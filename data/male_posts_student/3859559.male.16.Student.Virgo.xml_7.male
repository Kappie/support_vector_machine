Alright i know what you're think what the fuck are you doin at a country music festival. Tell you what I wasn't there for the music I was there for the booze and the women. I had so much fun 3 cases of beer 2 bottles of Pucker in to the weekend I found the perfect girl. She's got the same name as a car, but the girl was so hot that didn't matter. That's all the detail I will give you in here. Great weekend thought we had a water fight saturday which was cool. Then we went driving around the camp spraying people that looked at us funny. Hey guys I highly recomend you check out the Wallace Motongator. Just fill your weekend with women and booze and nothing will bother you.  Remember: B, double E, double R, U, N!!!
