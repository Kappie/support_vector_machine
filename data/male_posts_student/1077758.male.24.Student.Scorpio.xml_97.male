No major blowups in the car or anything. Got to see Vegas again, then we went north and looked at a whole bunch of parks in Utah and Colorado and the like, saw the other side of the Grand Canyon, had the parents freak out because of a narrow walkway that would have surely plummeted them into a cavernous rock surface that would cause their primitive skull casings to spray jelly everywhere upon impact but hey, that's life, eh?  Good times, good times.
