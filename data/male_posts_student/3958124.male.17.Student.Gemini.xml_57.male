Honestly, when I see any Chinese characters that are affixed, stuck, tatooed, or otherwise attached to a white guy or a white guy's property, I think "Asshole." Pure and simple.  "Do you know what that thing says?" "Na, bra, it looks cool though, don't it?" "It say's 'I prefer underaged boys to women my age', you prick!" "Ya, but it looks cool though, don't it?"  These stickers also appear on cars. Not your mom's Subaru Outback or your dad's Lincoln Town Car. The cars they appear on usually have a four foot wide sticker on the windshield proudly announcing the brand of their "ride" in some exotic font. The side usually has some extremely lame graphic, like a silver and blue eagle, or a golden sword - think "The Fast and the Furious". But they always manage to stick a character in for "Deadly Strike" or "Swift Claw" right above the gas cap.  I'm sick of this. It's not cool.  Less Chinese, sooner.
