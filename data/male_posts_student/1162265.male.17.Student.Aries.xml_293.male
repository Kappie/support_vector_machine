So the only things that leaves me to do is try to find an identity, which never works, which leaves me feeling more depressed.    The worst part about it, is it's not even normal depression.  It's like this mild empty feeling I get in my stomach.  Maybe it's also because I'm tired, because whenever I feel like that it usually goes away by the next time I'm in school.  Maybe it's the repressed virgin in me crying out in pain? Haha. Yeah, that's a good way to view depression.
