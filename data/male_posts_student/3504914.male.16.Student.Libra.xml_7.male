I spent a lot of time going with my dad to deal with stuff related to getting his work visa renewed. Didn’t do much else except eat. Well, I bought two CDs, two jeans, and a book.   I chatted with two girls there, both who I’ve never met before, so that was cool. While we’re on the subject of beauties, I fell in love while I was in Singapore. I fell head over heels in fact. God, she was such a beauty. Great lenses, great frame, manual focus, auto focus, oh baby. The  Sony DSC-F717 . Now, my only drawback with this baby is that you can’t control the damn shutter speed, something that is becoming increasingly a need for me (I who like to experiment… Hot ladies, who like to experiment too, give me a ring-a-ling-ling). Well, it made my mind perform multiple orgasms anyway. From this I conclude my mind is a woman, and now I am stuck trying to figure out how she manages to live in this body which pays homage to masculinity and chauvinism. ANYWAYS, I need to find a digital camera which fills my every need. If you’re a single camera, call me.     Finished reading  1984  and it is a good break from the usual stuff I read. I highly recommend it for anybody who liked  Animal Farm  (also by Orwell). Favourite bits from it? Well, the repeated mantra is one.  “War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is Strength”   And the other would be the whole book xD    Topic : How I Can’t Be Screwed To Make Another Topic Right Now  See title above.
