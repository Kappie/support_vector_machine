I wish that you would just leave. Because your presence still lingers here. And it won't leave me alone.  These wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cry, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. And you still have...  All of me.  You used to captivate me by your resonating light. And now i'm bound by the life you left behind. Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams. Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me.  This wounds won't seem to heal. This pain is just too real. There's just too much that time cannot erase. When you cry, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. And you still have... All of me.  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone. But though you're still with me. I've been alone all along.  When you cry, I'd wipe away all of your tears. When you scream, I'd fight away all of your fears. I held your hand through all of these years. And you still have... All of me.
