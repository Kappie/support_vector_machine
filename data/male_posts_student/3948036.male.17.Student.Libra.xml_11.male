Well some would say The Godfather, but in my opinion The Untouchables is better. I mean the music in that movie! It's magnificent. The 'danger'-music is truly terrifying, but I have to say the music that's entitled to Al Capone is the best. It kind of reminds me of something that would feature in something Japanese, like an anime-movie or something. If I ever was to make a movie I would definitively have Ennio Morricone do the score. But what are the odds of that happening?  I've been following Paradise Hotel the last few weeks, and it's at the end now. I haven't seen too much of the first ten-or-so episodes, but I knew enough to keep up with what was happening. Right now there seems to be a lot of trouble in Paradise, seeing as the people that had been 'voted' off the show, came back and they've watched all the episodes of the show to see who's been going behind who's back. It's so much fun! They're arguing like crazy, and there was even a threat of physical violence! "I'll come visit you in Arizona when your brother moves there... with about 50 guys." Oo that Zack sure is a rough customer. I don't know what it is about reality-shows, but once you've watched around 3 episodes you just have to know what happens next! And by 'you' I mean me. But it's fun to be the only one in your class watching some stupid reality-show. Last year I talked a lot of shit about a show called "Singel 24/7". And I was the only one watching it! No one else I've talked to since that show started/ended, has watched it. It's crazy... Or maybe I'm crazy?  I stood up early today to clean a bit. My older brother is coming home for a short while, and the house was really messy, so I had to take action. And if you ask me, I think I did a fairly decent job.  I think I have to do a countdown for me going to the Oya-Festival in Oslo. It's only 9days until I get my ass on a train down there! I got butterflies already! I'm going to see The Streets, Velvet Revolver(I've only heard one song with them but I think it should be good... if I don't like the performance, at least the ambience will be rawk'n'rawl) and Span among manymanymany bands. It'll be 4 days of music and it's a fair upgrade from my first festival last year which was Norwegian Wood. Me and my buddy John went there to see Audioslave which was pretty frikkin awesome. We were right in the middle of the mosh-pit with a perfect view of the stage. I hope I have an experience like that at this year's festival. I think Velvet Revolver and The Streets will be my best bet... Maybe Span as well.   9 Days and counting....  Song Of The Day: Phantom Planet - Big Brat         You're alwaaaaays up to noooo good!
