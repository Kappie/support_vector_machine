Flowers, although devoid of their daily hues, were still offering their amorous perfume, and while birds were in distant slumber, crickets were providing the symphony of the night… 	 	They were the only ones who were witnessing that night’s wonder and Mina thought it was best that way.  They were holding each other’s hands, looking at each other’s eyes, feeling each other’s warmth.  And the whole place was engulfed in silence.  Mina wanted to say something but the beating of his heart enthralled her. So time passed through them, without any sound disturbing their togetherness.  	Until he uttered so softly, “Mina, promise me one thing: never open your eyes…”  	But she did.  She had to.  It was another dream and the sun had already taken its place in the sky.  When light fully entered her eyes, she closed them quickly.  The light seemed foreign to her.  She has not been used to it ever since he left.  She got up from her bed with her eyes half-opened; walked towards the windows, and closed the blinds.  She welcomed the slight darkness.  She went back to her bed and laid there, not knowing what to do next.  	She thought of the dream.  It was different from the others she had in the past.  It was more vivid, more lucid.  She really felt his hands, his warmth and his heartbeat.  She could still hear the crickets, and the fragrance still caresses her nose.  It appears to have happened just minutes ago. And his voice, his plea; it still echoes in her ears.  She began to cry.  ********************************  	It was dusk and they were both lying on the grass, looking at the sky’s fading and morose light.  There were no clouds, no birds, no wind.  Mina was smiling, for they were together.  But, his countenance was filled with uncertainty.  She wondered why.  	Suddenly he stood and said, “Mina, I have to go.” 	Startled, she replied,” Why? It’s still early.” 	He helped her stand up, looked at her and uttered, “I really have to go.” 	“Oh, sure.  I’ll call you, ok?” 	“Don’t” 	“Huh, why?” 	“Because I have to go.” 	 And she understood.  It was over.  She lowered as the wind finally announced its presence. Leaves began to rustle.  She wouldn’t cry.  She never cried in front of him.  	Then she heard again his voice.  This time it seemed far away, though he is still near.  “I loved you, Mina.  God knows how much I loved you.  But, it’s all over now.  I wanted to tell you sooner but I didn’t have the courage.  I have fallen out of love, Mina.  I’m sorry.  I hope you understand.  Please understand.” 	 	“I understand.”  That was all she could say.  	“Thank you.  Please move on.  I wish you luck.  I wish you happiness.  Listen, I’m just not the right man for you, ok?  You’ll find him soon.”  	“I know.”  	He looked up.  He seemed to be thinking of the right words to say. And finally, he said solemnly, “Mina, have a final glimpse of light.  Night is coming.”  With that said, he walked away just as leaves and tears began to fall.  ***************************************  	She went to her drawer and found it.  Her face was still drenched with tears.  She walked again towards the windows, but this time very slowly.  She stood there for a long time, gazing at nothing, but thinking of him.  He was her life; her breath, her sight, her music, her purpose.  	When her tears had dried off, she opened the blinds and whispered, “My final glimpse of light.”  	Her eyes closed, never to open again.
