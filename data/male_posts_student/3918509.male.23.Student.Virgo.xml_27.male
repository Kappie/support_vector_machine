I don't deny the statement.  And I happily accept all the criticism I deserve.    Well, being the ignorant but eager student of humanity that I am, I went in search of Mr. Kohlberg and found this in a  urlLink blog post  by  urlLink Marvin Olasky  (EIC of the Christian news magazine   urlLink World   and a journalism prof at Texas):  Some WORLD readers may be familiar with the work of Lawrence Kohlberg, who became famous for proclaiming ethical stages through which he thought people should move: from following the law to "social duty" and perhaps to "autonomous ethical thinking," wherein a person makes up his own principles. Kohlberg argued that such ethical autonomy should be the goal of human existence-even though in this stage humans are in some ways the most selfish, virtually inventing a world, totally apart from God.   I'd propose instead of Kohlberg's six or seven stages just three. First comes the glory stage, the I'm-the-center-of-the-world thinking within which we attempt to glorify ourselves. Next comes the glory, glory stage, when we strive to promote not only ourselves but a collective entity as well: perhaps a nation, perhaps a business, perhaps Communism. Our goal, however, should be to move by grace to the highest stage, where we act to bring glory, glory, glory to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (And in the course of glorifying God we may bring honor to ourselves and to our nation or business.) Education, the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty, indeed!
