I was playing my guitar with it on and it looked like I was playing in slow motion lol. So I have decided that before I die I will have sex with a strobe light on. Yay! So today I spent most of the day over there, and while we were playing around with jis little brother, Anthony slid into my foot and he tore off part of my toe nail. It hurt like a bitch! I couldn't put my shoe on all day lol. When I got home I just talked to Stacey and played my guitar.
