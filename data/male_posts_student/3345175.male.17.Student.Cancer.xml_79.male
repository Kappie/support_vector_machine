Wasnt brain-wrackingly bad. I either knew the answer or how to do it, or i didnt. Simple. Not stressful. But i wouldnt count on my getting any better than a C, if even a C, so thats brilliant!  Had drama yesterday, which was okay but i completely ended up the most knackered i have been in a long time. That mighta been due to Friday night's complete allnighter, Saturdays collapsing in the wee small hours of the morning and not waking up till bout 6am, and the fact that the exam itself is criminal.  Anywayz am all happy now. Get to sleep, which ive forgotten the feeling of. But tomorrow i gotta get up to go on my last S5 drama trip. George Gershwin musical "Crazy For You" or sumthin like that, in Edinburgh. These things are always a laff, so should have fun.  If i can find that bloody consent form.  DAMMIT!  Anywayz after my thingy today i went for lunch with mother [twas very nice - had the weirdest burger ever, a chickenburger with bacon and cheese...WEIRDO!], and then on the way home stopped in for a rousing three-dance round on the dancemachine.  I actually dont have much to say tonight. Except that Daniel's invited me to stay at his on Saturday night. And i sooo wanna go.   Must convince mum...or get her very uncharacteristically drunk...  Hmmmmm...how?    Milk milk, lemonade, around the corner fudge is made.
