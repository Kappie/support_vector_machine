Not a big day, she got a TV and a batting helmet for softball. I had drums, as always, at 2 and I couldn't make it to Bosch's grad party. Mad me a little mad. But then I go to talk to Alyssa, and find out that she is at Andrea Golby's grad party (which I supposedly knew about). So, yeah, I sat bored at home. It was okay tho, I'd recover.  Oh wait, the next day would be Sunday. Not much a recovery at the end of the day. I got up did the church thing as usual. Then I headed out to Sarah's softball game, always a good time. We (Alyssa, Chris, and I) walked to Tim's house, but he wasn't there. All good fun tho. But then the trouble starts.  The game lasts too long. We miss the showing of Harry Potter we were gonna go see, and I still have to make it to my sister's b-day party at 6. The showing is 6:40. So, Obviously, I can't go. Accordingly, Alyssa gets mad at everyone. But we fixed it, a little bit. (I still think she was lying to me.) But I get dropped off at Chuck E. Cheese's and everyone else heads to Tinseltown. (Just across a few parking lots.) Time frame: 5:30. I head into CEC and hang around a little. Until my mom shows up, she gets the party going. Everyone shows up I talk for a little bit, play the games. I win 300 some tickets... So, I'm sitting there, out of tokens, and I'm really bored. No one cares to talk to me... So. Yeah. I get an idea. I'll walk to the movies. So I clear it with my parents and I'm allowed to go to the movies but I don't have a ride home. Dern. But, I'm a smart boy, Alyssa always tells me to call her mom if I need a ride. And I need one. So I call and now I have a ride home. I tell my parents the plan and high-tail it out of there.  Time frame: 6:43. Movie started at 6:40. I RUN across CEC's parking lot, a Lowe's parking lot, a street, and Tinseltown's parking lot. I get in and buy my ticket. Apparently, Alyssa's mom called the others and gave them a heads up. Alyssa meets me in the lobby, amazed that I showed up. But worried that my parents will hate me for me coming to the movies. I go into the movies during the Garfield preview and have a great time. I always love spending time with Alyssa. I also learned a new talent.... Lol...  Monday now... School day. Boring as always. I had a Ortho appt. but I wasn't going to miss reviewing for finals. So I cancelled that and stayed to study for Science.  Tuesday, FINALS START! Oh yay! Tons of fun here. I studied... For once. French was pretty easy, I just didn't know the Mettre verb. Oh well. English was easy. Gym, of course it was easy, run for 12 minutes. Even I can do it. History's is tomorrow. Math's was okay. A little tricky. Not one in Art. Science.. A little confusing, but I think I will do alright.. I need an A. Band, was gay.  One more day of school, I think I can survive.  Oh, crap. I forgot about my talk with Amy. Wow, is all I have to say. And I wish her the best of luck.  Essentially, Today is yesterday's tomorrow that you didn't care about.  !--::*ADDITION::*--!  I forgot about swimming, and how could I?!?!? I named this post after my expirience. I was swimming in my nice pool when I hear a splash. What could it be? I look over and peanut is swimming towards me. Loo. Who woulda thunk it?!? Loo, It was a funny story. I love swimming. And hey, my pool's open. Come on down to swim.
