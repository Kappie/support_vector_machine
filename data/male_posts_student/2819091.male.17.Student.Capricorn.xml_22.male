Chills my soul in many stirring ways, Her beauty, her charm; How she reached to me with an open arm... How she gave me such emotions warm To feel...  I can't believe it... Could this be real?  Mattea Duquette, How I wished I never met you... Yet in years forgotten, I wished to meet someone like you. What should I do? I want to remember you yet I want to forget you too. I want to forget you as easily as you have forgotten me, I want to forget everything, for this feeling wouldn't leave me be. I try to move on with my life, Yet the memories of you penetrate through me like a sharp knife.  Please... Could anyone tell me how I could be able to forget her As easily as she has forgotten me... I want all of her memories in my head to flee... Forever. I want to say goodbye, yet my mind says "Never." Please... Help me.
