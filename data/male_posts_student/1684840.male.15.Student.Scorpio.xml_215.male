I got a little wet after getting caught in it while watering the nextdoor neighbour's plants (as if they needed it lol)  No Sam today, aparantly he is back...now! He better be on MSN or something, we need to talk lol, and aparantly he has a tan to match his hair mwaha. I was invited out yet again today but I refused because there might have been people there that I aint comfortable around, but it turns out there wasn't and I missed being with my mates during that wicked thunder storm! The rain came down and lightning spread across the sky in all directions. The roads were flooding up and this 'porky woman' (as Ryan called her) was jumping up and down in a MASSIVE puddle lmao.  Then it cooled off for a bit and came back quietly later. I reckon the weather tomorrow is going to be perfect but I have a feeling it is going to be miserable again...  Oh yeah, I have recieved Â£90 for doing lots of website jobs for a friend, plus $5 payed into Paypal for the first survey I did on this amazing site. Saving now for lots of PC upgrades hehe...
