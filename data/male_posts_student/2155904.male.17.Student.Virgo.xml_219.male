Hence the great title of this first post in which Tyke actually uses titles.  So today was a day off for Tyke.  Just cuz he is a senior.  But really it seems like there were quite a few seniors who didn't skip today.  Maybe it was a normal amount though.  Tyke wasn't a senior other years so he can't tell ya.  Maybe if he doesn't graduate he can tell you next year.  But don't hold your breath, cuz holding your breath for a year is a long time.  You'd most likely die.  But in the rare chance you didn't die, you'd most likely come to find out that Tyke graduated so you were holding your breath for no reason anyway.  So here's how today went for all of you Tyke-heads out there.  Tyke got up at 10 and planned a poker game with Kinker for 11 at Tyke's house.  Kinker, Dr. Phil, DCups, Skippy, and Macaroon came.  Skippy came for only a little but he still left with a few bucks.  Tyke ended up losing 15 but then got a one dollar bonus for using his house and such.  So he only lost 14 in the end.  Once everyone left Tyke went to Dotti's house for some lunch and they planned to see Harry Potter.  However, not many people ended up coming apparently so they just went to lunch.  Purdy, Karla, Dudely Doo, Big Poppa Booty were all there.  They had some good Red Robin chow and stayed there for a while.  Then everyone dissipated and Tyke and Dotti went and rented a movie before going back to Dotti's and splitting there.  Tyke came back home and was just kinda like, damn.  Mainly cuz he wanted to hang out with the girls for longer but then he knew his parents wouldn't be too keen on him hanging out with them later at night like he could have so he ended up not doing anything really for the rest of the day.  He did re-burn some of his lost mixes and he wrote a nice note as well.  That was something he just needed to do.  He just needed to get some things out and since he has been struggling with writing songs for a while he just wrote them in words in a personal manner.  Then he listened to some good music, mellow music that is, and played some ESPN.  And now he is listening to American Pie while the M's play in the background with mute on.  And "this'll be the day that I die..."
