I noticed early today that something wasn't right. I work in a copy center and for the life of me I couldn't seem to hit the right buttons on the machine. I had to recycled more botched jobs today than I care to admit.  Normally I have no problem answering questions or ringing up people's orders, but today I was fumble fingers and mumble mouth. "Everything he touches turns to shit!" Then I saw him. The super cutie in the paper aisle. He was with a friend. They stood there puzzling over which paper to buy. I should have realized that there was no possibility of striking up a conversation without mussing things up, but did that stop me? Of course not, today is Idiot Day.   He wanted to know if a certain pack of paper was glossy or not. How simple a question! I knew that it was not, but do you think I could manage a simple no? Of course not, today is Idiot Day. As I sat there struggling to open the package of paper to double check that it was, indeed, not glossy paper I thought about how much better it would have been if I had never gotten out of bed.   There is nothing worse than trying to look your sexiest while fighting to remove a plastic wrapper. Just ask anyone who's ever tried to open a condom  after  things get busy.  Anyway, it all went downhill from there. I'm going to bed.   P.S. I accidentally closed my browser while typing this entry. I had to retype it all. I give up!
