Thanks to those who came to see the play-- it did have some great lines, the definitive one probably being "WHAT??" That's a cast joke... Marten is letting me share his topic of subject lines-- quotes from movies and books. That one is from Monstrous Regiment, the newest Terry Pratchett. And now I have to go, for the stage calls me home in about 45 minutes.  SQ(u)EE!
