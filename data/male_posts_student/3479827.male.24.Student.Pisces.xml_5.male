After the cool huang shan mountain and the humid shanghai weather, the hot and very dry 36 degrees of shijiazhuang was quite a shock! We jumped straight into an air conditioned taxi back to yuqi's parents house.  Upon our arrival, we had a quick lunch together before her parents returned to work. After that, yuqi and i were still quite tired after all the travelling and took the opportunity to relax in the air conditioned apartment.  The heat outside really was too much, so we stayed in all afternoon. Later we all cooked dinner together and ate it with some nice cold shijiazhuang beer (san jiu pi jiu -three nines beer).  After dinner, we chatted whilst looking through some fantastic old photos of yuqi's family's travels. There's still plenty of wonderful places for us to visit next time!  Interesting china fact #9 - car number plates here are numbered quite differently to the uk. First there is a chinese character showing the area of origin. Then follows a letter showing which city/town or a number 0 denoting police. Finally is a serial number, lower numbers showing greater importance and status. For example, a number less than 100 could be a government or high ranking police leader. Most cars have numbers much higher, usually 5 or 6 digits.
