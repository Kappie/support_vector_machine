I know everyone has seen that stupid asian guy William Hong on American Idol, the guy who sucked at sining she bangs it was "funny"  But of course the press and music people had to jump on it. So instead of him fading into bolivian(sp) they over do it and give him a record contract, a FUCKING record contract, and all this press. All the people think it's some feel good story because he "had no regrets" and he "tried his best".  Well woo fucking who, you are a busted num shit who has some crooked ass teeth with fuzz growing out of them and can't even sing the right lyrics to a song. He is seriously dumb, have you ever heard him talk? God it makes me soo mad the way America rewards people that are sucky because they think it's soem sort of rebel thing to do. And now being a rebel is all of a sudden some sort of trend now. It's so god damn annoying and any of you who think this guy is still funny or anything go jump off a cliff right the fuck now. You should die.
