Well, in the morning I read a bit of my book, and watched the first half of the Shawshank Redemption, which I taped from last night. Seemed fairly good, but before I had finished it my mum announced that me, mum and my 2 sisters were to take a trip to Tonbridge, a fairly nice town in the South somewhere. It was also announced that we were to go swimming in the outdoor pool there. This wouldn’t have been a problem if it weren’t for the following facts.  1) I have not been swimming for about 2 years (excluding going to a friends house and going in his pool, but there wasn’t much swimming.  2) I’m not even sure if I can swim anymore.  3) My swimming trunks have not been worn for at least a year, and so I’m not sure if they still fitted.  So, I tried to suggest somewhere else to go, but no one else would hear of it, so I packed my things and we left by about 11:00.   We got there, and on a small patch of grass by the pool, we ate a lunch that we had prepared earlier. (sandwiches, crisps, and bits of cucumber and raw carrot with some tasty dip things – lovely). Eating that, as it was a nice day I decided to sit back against a nearby wall whilst listening to some of my music on a CD player. And here I was so comfortable that I ended up laying right down on our picnic mat and sunbathing fully clothed. That’s the way to do it – you don’t get burnt :) Anyway, I decided not to bother with all the changing, getting wet, drying and everything else that comes with swimming, so I lay there in all my peace. Then after 1 hour 45 minutes of paying to come in, people with black wristbands – that was us – were called out. Although I was ready to go by then anyway. So we walked back to the car, dumped our stuff, and walked round the nearby park. I had a bit of fun doing summersaults on a rail held about 4 foot in the air, and also swinging upside down by my legs. Should have taken a photo, but didn’t, so you’ll have to take my word for it. I probably looked like a right prat, but it was fun :)  And then we came home, and all had a barbeque in the garden, with burnt burgers et al. And now here I am.  Ta for now.   Weather:  Hot, sunny. Slightly cloudy now  Reading:  Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves  Listening to:  Monty Python soundtrack - Decomposing Composers  Watching:  Shawshank Redemption  Confused about:  The inevitability of burnt food on a barbeque  Annoyed with:  Nowt  Mood:  Fine
