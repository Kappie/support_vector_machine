As you'll see in every other blog by kids from my school, we're all busy as hell.  Eighth grade is not a kind year.  We have to keep up with national standards, get ready for high school, get in everything necessary for graduation, take numerous tests, and all the while we're fighting off the collapsing walls of our social lives....  Don't ask...  I promise you I'll have something soon.  Please, stand by this bullshit.  I need you people.  You are the blood and soul of this blog and all it makes...  I've been watching too many early morning preachers...  Trust me on this one: Stay the hell away from Pat Robertson.  He's 5 steps away from George Bush, and only 2 genes away from a spider monkey...
