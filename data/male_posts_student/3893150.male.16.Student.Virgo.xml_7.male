Bankok 8 by John Burdett. about a cop in Bangkok who witnesses the murder of an American marine and his partner. big conspiracy, who-can-you-trust thriller. damn good. well, I got home that sunday, just chilled out monday. Tuesday, me and Reynolds went swimming and we smoked up. good times. chilled out on my own the rest of the week. whole lotta PS2 and movies went down. Friday, went out with Bartlett, Reynolds and Shauna. met up with Farrell later on. smoked a doober around 12, hung out at a playground, being high fools for a couple hours. didn't do anything over the weekend. maybe swimming later tonight...maybe not.  on a sidenote, I have this sick fascination with trash TV that comes on really late at night, roundabouts 4 am here. shit like Jerry Springer, Elimidate...it just makes me laugh. I'm glad there's fools like this to keep me occupied during the wea morning hours.  this summer has flown by. I have a supplementary math exam one month from today.  gotta start studying for that sometime soon...within the next couple of weeks, for sure. fuck man....my last year of high school. never thought I'd see the day. King Of The School, baby! hah...not likely. I guess that's it for now. it being 4:35 in the PM, I should probably get dressed and showered soon. chow.
