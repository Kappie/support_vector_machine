I was like the last one up and inputted my height, age, and sex.    After doing everything correctly on my part, the machine displayed that I was 150 lbs with 15% body fat (twice!) and 100 lbs with 9% body fat (also twice, hahah).  So its gotta be my chi internal energy, thats diverts the pulse the machine shoots through you.  Screwed up, eh?
