Scgs gals really   KICK ASS   man. Nowhere willl u see as much talent as i saw last night. To all not present, it was a peranakan-themed nigth with all the 4 classes performing, having a peranakan theme/storyline. 3 sec4 and my sister's (!) sec3 class was performing. Naturally, the sec3s lost but damn, the sec 4s were   gooood.   I nearly peed in my pants when i watched the first play, a comedy remake of shakespeares' The Merchant Of Venice. It was so funny cos they keep emphasising Antonio's gayness and the "loan" of Antonio from shylock was "nine-layered cake" or  jio chen gao.  All the characters were peranakan and Portia was a  bibik.  The last play by tessa rambles' class, was equally as funny and they won the dramafest (the story was about a pair of worried peranakan parents trying to marry off their son after he comes back from the states from uni education). Im definitely going back next year and to all the mean gals who  didn't  want to come along: HAH! U dun noe wat u missed man!  Sigh . . . being back in sc was sooo nostalgic, seeing all the teachers dressed up in peranakan clothes and being in a WHITE not  grey   school   for once. And there was NOT, i repeat, not a single J1 in da house! That means no sc gals in j1 now actually came back to watch except for me and my entourage. Wow, they missed some good shit cos it was even better than sc dance nite. But there were j2s though . . .    P.S. Somehow all the sc gals now look better (but also sluttier)
