It was a 1992 rematch against Boris Spassky, whom he defeated to win the 11th World Chess Championship in 1972.  The rematch was played in Yugoslavia in violation of economic sanctions.  This chess match apparently boosted Yugoslavia's economy to the point of making them dangerous to the US, so Bobby now faces extradition from Japan.
