Can’t do without, like medical doses. But as we grow, we all change, So one rose fell out of the range. As it fell, the thorns pierced into my heart,  The cut was deep n really hard. Then I realized how far we were, apart. She told me,  “like this, is what I am! I don't wana give a d*amn !!!”  and these words drowned me like quicksand... Coz only seeing her own stand, How I feel, she won’t wana understand.  Love n friends, these two gems,  To go on, I feel weak without them. Hope that fallen rose, one day, will fall back in place,  n Let me,  once again, see its glamorous grace.
