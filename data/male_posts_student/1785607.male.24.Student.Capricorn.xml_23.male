Mom, Dad and I attended the ceremony in which he received a plaque and his diploma.. I was tired, had a deadline and stuff... anyway, I was there and had a horrible time: those long speeches, one after the other... endless boredom... But at the end, they made something no one expected: they showed a movie, well a collection of pictures taken during all their years at school... the most important thing about it is that they started with pictures of everyone when they were kids or babies... When I saw my baby brother up there, his baby picture, I just couldn't hold it.. I started crying ( as I am now ), mom too... Dad, he held in there ( as I was told, by mum, he cried at the ceremony held on a church early in the morning ), I just couldn't... it was an emotional moment...   I am so proud of him... I just don't have words to describe my feelings... just hope that he makes all the right decision he needs to be happy... and wealthy ( j/k )... AND AS I REMEMBER ALL THIS, I'LL KEEP ON CRYING... IS JUST SUCH A GOOD FEELING I CAN'T KEEP IT IN MY CHEST...
