Something about me being listed in the bible as God xD     Heathen talk! CURSE HIM!    Anyways, you’ll notice that though only a day has passed, I’m reading another book. So maybe you didn’t notice, and if you didn’t, you make me sad.  Switch Bitch  was REALLY short. Lovecraft is, in my experience, fucking excellent with his words, or a fucking tart. His scary stories truly are scary, as opposed to the shit movies they come out with these days.  The Ring ,  The Stupid Movie that Begins with The , etc. But then you have his meh-ish stories which make you think he’s a bloody retard. If you can, try pick up his  urlLink  Cthulhu Mythos   stories, written in the later part of his life, and are much grander in ideas. For a week or so I tried imitating his style and failed simply because the imagery is just so vivid and yet, simple.       Have I anything else to talk about?     No, not really, I’m sorry. Today has been trying in so many ways.
