Getting off the plane at Bergstrom last night, I wondered if I had done things right.  I worked.  I relaxed.  I read.  I wrote.  I played a lot of grabass.  Sometimes I played no grabass at all.  I drank a lot, and I went almost two months without drinking anything.  I went to the beach.  I spent so little time at the beach.  I made money.  I didn't make enough.    But I don't want to be anywhere else, not now, and not then.  I think it was in Poway, CA where I was finally happy to be where I was, and while I knew I would be leaving soon and I would miss the people there and the San Diego breeze, I was excited about Arkansas.  And then I had to leave Arkansas, and some of the best friends anyone could ever know, but I was excited about Winston-Salem.  And the same thing there, and at Duke, and in Little Rock, and then even in Florida.    And now Austin.  Again.  Beginning my third year.  I was shat out in Year 1, gorged on by a hungry metropolis that didn't bother to taste, just enriched itself on my meager content and spent me.  I worked my way back in Year 2, focusing on myself, getting shit together so I couldn't be hurt again, and in that way, distancing myself from the city.  And now, Year 3.  Taking who I am and making something happen in this city.  I will write screenplays, I will graduate with a 4.0, I will do everything I need to do for me.  But that includes doing a lot of things that aren't directly for me.    If I'm supposed to call you because you're new in the city or I now know you live here after years apart, I can't do it right now.  Hotmail isn't working, and I never punched your phone #s into my phone.  Be patient.  I've got to be.  UT says I can grab an emergency cash loan on the 15th of August, they say this two weeks ago.  So I come back on this day in order to get this.  They say it's no go, but I can get it tomorrow!  Except they're closed tomorrow, and they're closed on Sunday, so I can't get it until Monday.  HOORAY!
