Today went fairly well, I managed to see Aliens verus Predators with David, his bro and his bro's possy. It wasn't that scary to my discontent. The focus ended up being more on the use of highly advanced graphics rather than the suspsense of the ol' movies. The lack of suspense was due to the fact it was the predators verus the aliens rather than the puny human verus aliens, so they could be more cocky and insert some amusing scenes and just crazy battle scenes.  Besides the movie I went for another in car driving lesson today, I'm improving. This is good. Josh has agreed to buy my old left handed bow, so I'm in a good mood about that. I'm letting it go real cheap just 'cause I'm a nice guy and want it put to good use. I haven't used the bleedin thing in years, I prefer my longbow over that over-rated hunk of metal they call a compound.  Let's see, I've agreed to help michelle with a terrarium. She's taking over Kyle's neglected gecko. Kyle is also back from camp today, I know michelle has not been exactly looking forward to his return. Sticky situation which seems to only become more sticky as time goes on.
