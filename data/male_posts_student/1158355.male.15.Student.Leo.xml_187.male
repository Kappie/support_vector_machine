I went all out on my drums and went crazy playing all the rudaments. My hands are like gods now. I'm also starting to grow black callasses, yummy. Anyways today was a great day where I showed everyone my nude ladies on my picture phone. So today was a happy day. I'm no longer depressed and Corey might be the new guitarist for our band. YES! Tomorrow, James and I are going all out for real, lady! Ok, I'm not making sense to anyone right now but James. So 25 hundred goodbyes to y'all. Tomorrow's freaking Friday! No not Freaky Friday. Lindsay Lohann hit the spot. 123, shoot.
