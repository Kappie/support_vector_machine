I want some more people. Make it a real Ericville Community. Well nothing happened really. Its been pretty low key except for my girl. I will publish about Amanda later. Oh today after school and and I went driving around and playing with people walking home from school. We asked for directions and asked one girl in a pervy voice "You wanna go for a ride little girl". Then we drove along and played with a TSC truck. We keep doing u-turns and going back and forth down this street. I think we freaked out this girl. I know this girl very little but she is in my gym class. She must live down their. Ha we drove up and down the street stoping and looking around. The guys in the truck were lafing but the girl (ha her name is amanda too) and some women was kinda freaking out I think. Oh well. Were gonna to it tomarrow for sure. Thats about it for now. Oh yeah I watch all the episods of the broken. They are alright. I want to see more out of them though.   Well blog ya latter ....eric...
