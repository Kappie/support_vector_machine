Yup so lets see what was good about today... NO SCHOOL! yay! and maybe (cross your fingers) it'll be to cold again tomorow and we'll have like a 5 day weekend... that'd be awesome.  anyway, as I was saying I worked on the new design today, and started a separate portion devoted to alias :P  called SD-8.  I think i'll have a screenshot of that too.  Speaking of alias, I'm thinking about having an alias party on sunday (since there's not school mon) and even though there's no new alias on ABC we'll be watching my season 1 dvd.  Yup so thats about it. so long for now.  My sis's like "is that your website?" "No It's my blog"  "Whats a blog"  "Web-log" yeah byebye
