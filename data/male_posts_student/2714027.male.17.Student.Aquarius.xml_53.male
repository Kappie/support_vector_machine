I wouldn't say that I enjoy work, but it's certainly better than it could be and it provides me with money for my gap year travels. I just had a night in to myself and watched a mildly entertaining rom-com called  Picture Perfect , starring Jennifer Anniston. Talking of TV,  Big Brother  starts this week, so I'll be following that for the next 10 weeks or however long it goes on for. Many people are cynical of it and rightly so, but I like it and I'm not quite sure why, but there you go.  Today I did some revision for tomorrow's Maths Mechanic exam (scary!), went out for a drive and did some crappy garden work. I work in a garden centre, but find gardening extremely boring - how ironic. Anyway, I'm watching  Armageddon  rigth now, the semi-probable disaster movie where a giant asteroid is heading towards the Earth and will   destroy everything in 18 days. Cue improbable heroes, patriotic music, the world uniting, predictable plot and a love story mixed in for good measure.  Well, until tomorrow...
