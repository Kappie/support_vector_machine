I haven't had time, and I've got to go out in a couple of hours and go sit in Gloucester because I don't want to get stuck on the late bus. It's the last night of the double for this show. Still, getting money, w00t. Does anyone still use that?  People have been invading my dreams, namely Sam, Rhiannon, Zoe, Sally Grant and Caroline. There's no order in that, I just thought I'd mention it.  I've still got to do this bloody English coursework.  Oh, that poem I wrote, 'Freedom?' is going to have to be retitled so I can send it to a competition held by the UCE. I'm thinking 'Equality?' so that I can keep the rhetoric in the title.  I'm looking ugly again. Nice to get back to reality, there.  I've been feeling really small over the past few days. Small as in childish, small as in insignificant... I don't like feeling small.  That feeling of getting left out is coming back to haunt me, too. I really want to get drunk and grope someone I don't know very well. Or be sober and grope someone I don't know very well. Either way is good.  Quote of the day: ""Beware the jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! Beware the jubib bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!""
