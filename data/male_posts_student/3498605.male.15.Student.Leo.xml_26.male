Basically, we were in a volley and my friend smashed it at me and the ball hit me in the...well, lets put it this way, it hit me where it hurt the most. Yeah, my friend who did that was being an ass. He though I was faking so he spiked balls at me while I was on the ground for 10 minutes. I mean, I never thought a little tennis ball could cause that much pain. I mean, the tennis ball is so light and hollow, you would never think that it could bring down someone in one hit. Anyways, I think I'm ok now, and we are gonna play tennis next week, becuase I'm not mad at my friend because it really was an accident. Anyways, I just thought I would share that. Oh, but before this post ends, I have to say something. On the tennis court we were playing on there was this random whole in the middle of the court, and it wasn't a small little dent, it was a hole about 2 feet deep and 1 foot wide, it was just so random. Anyways, I have been working on some pretty funny stuff for this site, and you should expect to see it in a few days.  later, bradleyJ
