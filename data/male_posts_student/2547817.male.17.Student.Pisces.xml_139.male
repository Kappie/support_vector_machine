Yesterday and today were special and I have learnt. Well actually, I just fought with my mother and I'm off centre, but I'll try to make this one good. On a slightly more trivial note, I decided to call yesterday, innuendo day simply because of the antics which my geography lecturer performed. He got the ball rolling when he hinted that he nearly said "bra". Being rather tickled, he slid into sporadic giggles. Yong Xi made it worse for the last row coz the lecturer was talking about erosion and he was like "the more you rub your rocks, the smaller they grow" and Yong Xi was like "are you sure?". That totally cracked me up! The lecturer kept talking about round rocks and about rubbing themand this was unfailingly accompanied by his hands forming individual cups at his chest. What a queer man.    I have been observing. The people in my school, generally, don't listen enough. Everyone's the one who're right and has to be heard. 10/10 for self confidence - I'll give 'em that. And the gossip and the politics - urgh. And to know what my friends partake from the same sustenance - double urgh. I think I think too much. But that's a good thing. Reading your environment helps you. It's like a cheat code which lets you see obstacles even before they stare you in the face, in a computer game.    Drama practice today was bad. I can't bring the humor in the scholar and the Vicomte out. I've got people coming to watch the play and I don't want to disappoint them. The nights of the 30th and 31st will be the proving grounds. To peers, audience, Madams and myself.    After that, I went to Chinatown to conduct a drama workshop for children. There were the naughty ones, so I played a littlegame of "lets see who can do the most push ups and sit ups" with them. That got them tired. A 7 year old swore at me in Hokkien and ran off too! We hopped about like rabbitsandspiderman. I love children. I dig children and dogs. That sounded terrific didn't it. The people who I was working with and the staff of the establishment commended me on my ability to work with them well. ACDC drama night was next. It was good. Humor was predictable and danceswere amateurish, but they made me laugh a lot and I think it was well done.    Last night. I went to Fairfield's production. It was alright. Things are improving between Zel and I. Kai Wei tells me not to push things. He is right. She needs her space. But I of all people should know her love is magic. I stood ouside the pet shop today watching. We used to go there on sundays just to watch the love birds. I want to move, but I don't want her to get pissed. Funny part is that she knows how I feel and she doesn't blast me for it. I am happy because of that. I wanted so desperately to get ont the bus she boarded, but I couldn't do it.    For now, I can just hope.
