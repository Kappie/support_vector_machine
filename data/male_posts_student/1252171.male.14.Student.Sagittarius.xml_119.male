"Peeeeeeeeeerrrrrfeh-ka-teh," says Camo, sarcastically, "let's go look at some of the other rides." "Kay," says Katt, and she puts the kiosk back in its capsule. They went on a slew of different rides, including the Tilt-O-Whirl (run by my friend Shane), and Katt found out that one of the things Camo should do is eat  after  the rides. At the end of their vacation, they decide to go to the gift shop, run by  urlLink Mandy . "Hey there!" says Mandy, "What will you be buying today?" "Ummm, how about this 1' Nightcrawler action figure?" asks Katt. " No, that's mine," says Mandy. "All 120 of 'em?" says Camo. "Yes," says Mandy. "How about this stand-up cardboard cut-out of Nightcrawler?" asks Camo. "NO! Not that! Definetly not that!" screams Mandy. "Okay, we'll just take these issues of Sonic the Hedgehog," says Katt, all weirded out. "That'll be $6.57, please," says Mandy, politely. "Thanks," they say, and quickly leave. "Well, I thought this vacation went pretty well," says Camo. "Me too," says Katt, and she gives Camo a small kiss on the cheek, "Wanna play DDR when we get home?" "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!" screams Camo as he runs off. "Hey, get back here!" says Katt as she gives chase.   THE END  -Sane Intolerant-
