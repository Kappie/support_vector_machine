He did something delightful today and went behind my back and "tattled" on me - for something rather rediculous that I didn't even realize was a problem. As soon as I was made aware of it, the common sense solution presented itself and I rectified the issue - problem would have been solved if he'd just talked to me, instead he breeds bad blood.  I brought him a few slices of pizza. A few reasons behind this - when someone does something nice for you when you've been a dick you feel extra guilty. Secondly, it will let him know that even though he's being a dick, it doesn't have to be that way.  He's intimated to several people that there are problems at home. This is not the sort of thing we make fun of (nonfunctional testicles notwithstanding). His wife really needs to get with the program, he's got needs too.  Okay, I need to stop that line of thought now.  Spider-man 2 the game rocks. Plain and simple. Go play it.  The outline for the article I'm doing for Massively Multiplayer Gems (2) has been greenlighted. Woo. PUBLISHED AUTHOR BABY! (assuming my drafts don't suck)
