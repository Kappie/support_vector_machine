The knights are from Sarmatia, except Arthur, who's from Sarmatia via Rome, and likely has never lived in Sarmatia. This isn't traditional Arthurian stuff, and the presence of French names (Lancelot,Dagonet) strains it. It's hard to believe that Lancelot, who's almost wholly the creation of the French romances, is a wild and wooly Eastern European horseman that fights with two swords. Also, Sarmatia really only functions to make the plot work -- it's far enough away that the knights need their papers to get home safely. Finally, we have no real idea of what the knights are like beyond broad strokes of personality -- Bors drinks too much and has eleven children with a Briton, Tristan's got a pet hawk and is a dead shot with a bow, Galahad's tired of fighting, Lancelot doesn't understand Arthur's religion, Dagonet and Gawain have no noticeable personality. There are too many characters for the movie to support. Even Arthur only gets the most basic of personalities. None of them really got enough screen time for me to give a damn about them or their fates. Also, it suffers from the same problem  The   Thin Red Line  had for me -- too manyactors looked vaguely alike (I had to piece together Tristan's death by who was still alive and what they were fighting with). Finally, Dagonet, if I recall my Arthurian myths correctly, was Arthur's fool, not a knight.I realize this last pointis overly technical, but why choose Dagonet and not Percival, Kay, or Bedivere, or another major knight such as...   Mordred . The entire Mordred story line was cut out. Gone. If I recall my Arthurian literature class from undergrad correctly, the unravelling of civilization, the destruction of the Round Table, and circumstances of Arthur's death (Mallory's workis, after all,  Le Morte d'Arthur ) are kind of the point of the story and myths. It's not to say you couldn't tell another story, and I don't dislike the idea of this one, but you get no sense of there being an end to it. Which leads me to the other thing that's not present in the story (and the movie I think most people want to see):   The Love Triangle.  When most people think of Arthur, I'm going to guess that the Guinevere-Lancelot thing comes to mind first. It could be the fault of Lerner  Loewe or Mallory or both, but this is present in every Arthur story from the French Romances on up. And it is the story, in my opinion, not "Arthur and his knights do really good deeds and sometimes free the Britons" -- it runs through everything in Mallory and comes up repeatedly in both Chr√©tien de Troyes and Tennyson. With the Mordred storyline, it's the major precipitating event of the end of times in the myth; both represent the dissolution of the bonds that hold society together. Mordred's the product of incest and Lancelotis breakinghis feudal vows by sleeping with Guinevere -- and that vow is what holds this society together. It's a bang-up story, and one worth telling, but it's not here. Instead, we get a few significant glances between Lancelot and Guinevere and then he dies fighting to save her. Not quite the same thing.   I did during the course of the movie think that the movie might be espousing some mild right-wing propoganda, but nothing solid enough to write about (and it probably was just me being paranoid). Was the film worth seeing? Probably worth renting. It was nothing too thrilling in the theaters. I had the distinct feeling that, despite the mediocre reviews its received, I should have seen  I, Robot  instead of  King Arthur . Of course, I probably should have saved the pass I used to see it until later in the summer, but that's neither here nor there.
