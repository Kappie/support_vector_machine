I've yet to give an excuse for speeding (or anything else) not because of pride, but because I know I'm just wasting the court's valuable time. The best excuse I heard tonight:  Defendant: "Well Your Honor, it was really late and I was trying to get home, you know, cuz it was late, but I guess I just didn't notice how fast I was going . . . "  Judge: So how many years have you been driving?  Defendant: "Since I was 16, Your Honor." (The man was about 30 years old.)  Judge: "And in all these years of driving you can't tell when you're going 84 in a 45?"  Defendant: "It was dark out . . . "  Judge: "Were you in the Air Force?"
