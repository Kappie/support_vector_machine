To this point all has being nice and polite, we haven't had a fight ( event thought seeing our temper, Rome could burn again ). What I was afraid of, and most of you could sense it in my previous posts, was the sense of, maybe, not having much in common in which to base this relation. I mean, being Gay is nice, but is not all.  I know that I love him, and is the second time I felt this strong about someone. But now, I know that we can spend time alone being us, without boring each other to death... He   is   what I need.   ... What's the matter with my classmates and me? We seem to just not care about school anymore. Well, maybe not school, just some classes... They are boring, senseless, long, tedious and useless. Most of us just wait for class to end to leave and grab a bite. This is not our usual behavior, so, what the fuck is going on? It is us, or it is the subject? I'm in love, so I don't care. I just have to say something different so no one can tell me that I'm a little bit obsessed, ah, screw you if you feel that way. I am obsessed, so what?... ( sorry for the "screw you" part, hang in there my friends )
