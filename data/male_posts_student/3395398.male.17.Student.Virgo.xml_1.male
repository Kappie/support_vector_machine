Things may seem to be getting better at a faster speed, but the faster you go, the eassier you may fall.  Just recently heard of a story, it's about a relationship of these two people. Everyone believe that they are the perfect match, they had only met for two or three month. The fondness has grown in both of their heart. And they got into a relationship.   Everything seems so perfect, everything goes on so fine. Everyone believe that they will never be apart. However, apart from this perfection, nobody, even themselves, realise that they are moving along in a very fast speed. They are climbing the stairs of love in a fast speed, maybe is the boy, who pull the girl up too fast.   The boy is a very serious about relationship and this is his first time got into a relationship. It became part of his life. Affecting his emotion, his thoughts and his everything, love makes this strong willed boy cried. The girl, a cheerful girl, the love bring her out of her carefree life which full of freedom, a man step into her life, whatever she does, she got to think how would he feel and think. The happy teenage girl's life is nowhere to be found.  Maybe it is because of the seriousness of the boy make her feel uncomfortable, maybe it is the restriction which the girl feels. One day, she told one her friend that, she doesn't feel good with his presence and she is regretting to get into a relationship because she doesn't know him well enough and with the past few months of being with him, she felt that this man is not the one suitable for her, though he is very good.  Cause and result? Things are going on too fast. The pressure that the boy impose on the girl is too intense, like "having dinner with the his father". Though I believe there is no natural perfect match in the world, the perfect match only form after years of understanding of each other. Time is the factot for everthing, everything happens in its own duration, we all need the patience to wait.  ..................................................................................................................  Yesterday is the Catholic High Music Award, Justin, with any doubt won the Best Solo Performance and the Best Performance of the Night!   And i saw her again, after last year September, was not looking forward to see her anymore since last year September, but i saw her again. It is not fate that let me see her again, I believe it is not. Fate decide that we are not gonna be together for long and we are not meant for each other. There results the separation, not temporary but permernant. Two people, who used to like each other, who used to say "I love you" are now met again. But no matter what, they are all "used to", she chose not to be friends, that's her choice, i respect her choice. I never regret to initiate the separation last year, i believe i made the most correct decision in my life till now, we are not suitable for each other. Now she is no longer part of my life, which I am happy with. I have my own life, hope that she will never enter my life again,  we shall be strangers.   ..................................................................................................................  Today, Cheryl, Debra and Lirong are leaving for italy for their Choir Trip, hope they enjoy themselves, it is great to have a break before all the tiring workloads flood onto everyone of us. Bon voyage and take care girls!  ..................................................................................................................  Everyday, lots of things happened, we can't be perfect for everything, even we want, it is impossible for everything, we need to give up at times and maybe just LET IT BE.
