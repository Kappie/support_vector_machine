I have to live with my little sister for at least another 4 years, on top of the 13 I've already endured.  Grrrrrrrrrrrr  Anyway, I've got very, very bored within 2 or 3 days of being home. Have been doing esceptionally random things like watching daytime TV and putting golf balls up and down the floor of my bedroom (I don't play golf).  Someone save me, Tribute to jamiesunl33tnessdoesntgetasmuchmoneyasconor, Simon
