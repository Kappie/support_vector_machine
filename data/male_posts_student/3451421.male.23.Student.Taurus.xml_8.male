If you are using a photo or picture with a lot of color fields as well as some blending of colors, jpeg will be the best bet. If you are going to save simpler things gif is better.  2.	Is gif legal or not? This is a tough question because thetre are many factors involved.  No one will be prosecuted for using gif but it’s partners like tiff are going to be much more srutinized. 3.	on my zine, www.albany.edu/~pm0115/zine.htm 4.	a) I feel like I have addreseed most of the points here, especailly numbers 1 and 14, you told us those exclusively. b) I havbe many priority accesability errors. The main function of these is to tell me things to make my website better. For example, I need a table summary.  Another thing is that my links aren’t exactly clear in were they are taking someone. Also, my table is apparently not formatted well. c) This is a good thing, it helped me understand what’s goin on woth my page.
