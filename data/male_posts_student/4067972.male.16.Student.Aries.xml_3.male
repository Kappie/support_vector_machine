My step brother and his girlfriend's two children were at home alone.  The youngest is ethan, who has to be on oxygen and a heart monitor;he's about 6 weeks old.  He was on a rug face down with a little bit of carpet in his mouth.  Honesty is just over 1 year old, and she was found in her room with a large knife on the floor. safe huh.  Both are ok now i think.  We're not sure how long they were alone, but my step brother and his girlfriend showed up 2hrs after the kids were found.  Who knows how much they had been leaving the kids alone before.  They're so stupid.  She smoked while she was pregnant with both kids, more with ethan.  Both of them smoke around both of the kids.  Child Services came and took the kids away to live with foster parents.  Hopefully we will be able to see them again, but who knows.  My Dad and step mom are still going to try to be the foster parents, but they don't know if they will be allowed to be because then, my step brother and his girlfriend would know where honesty and ethan were, and they would probably end up coming over and harassing my dad and step mom. There was a hearing earlier today, but i don't know the outcome.  Stupid people shouldn't reproduce.
