But I didn't think about what it ment outside of class.  After the last stories were handed back to us, she turned and mentioned that we wouldn't be seeing each other on a daily or semi-daily basis and she was sad bout it.  I mentioned I was bummed, knowing that I could say more, but wasn't/nor will ever be the right time to say something.  That's what its like when the other person's got a boyfriend. I really enjoyed standing with this girl at the bus stop talking with her (me probably doing too much talking cause I was nervous and she was quiet)  we stepped out of class, walked for a bit.  She said it was good to get to know me more and I mummbled something likewise.  She called me a sweetheart for hanging around with her and I got a big, tight long hug.  And though we were both wearing heavy coats, it felt really so good. Not in a sexual way at all, it just felt good to be close and know that someone, in a small way, appreciated me (eventhough I had my own selfish reasons for hanging around with her...loneliness)  She walked away, caught a bus and told me to email her.  I will-its a question of what length and voice.  Once I was well out of sight I started to tear up a little bit.   Met with my Rhet teacher and I'm getting a higher grade than I thought.  Oddly enough, he's very personable outside of class.  Just wish that was a bit clearer earlier in the semester.   Acted like a Professor in Po Mo today discussing Kerouac.  Right up my alley.  Subconsiously I grabbed flannel before the class and remembered that was one of JK's favorite get ups.  For what its worth.   I forgot how much I enjoyed reading/learned in that class.     I also sat with Miss E after class and talked for awhile, making her laugh all the time (not all that hard to do).  Philosophised on why selling shit in a business sense is much like trying to have sex...I didn't make eye contact.  Could have been weird.  Wasn't.     Really wish dating was simple as wishing cause all of things would have been solved earlier.  But I ain't gonna write a song about it.
