I only get C6 for the Mid Yr 'O' Level Mother Tongue n my MT oral get a Pass. Mayb compo, cloze passage  compre sections causes me to get such a low grade. Congrulations to Cheng Lee (the tall gal in case u dun know n also known as Jasmine)  Dong Hui cos they no need to retake at the end of the yr as they scored A1  A2 respectively. Very shock tat Dong Hui scored A2 cos he is from China so his Chi should b very gd. Feel so down abt tat. How will i feel if i get the same score as them? Hmm...... Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! Just joking n dreaming only! 2day leh, 4 Maths, we watch a 10min video abt students talking abt life in Temasek Poly. Mr Chinoh mentioned y we should work very hard, to get into poly n to do the courses tat u like. 4 the Mid Yr 'O' Level Mother Tongue results released yesterday, most of us done below our expectation. So during Chi lesson, Mr Ngm gives us a evulation form to fill in. The form tell us to comment y each one of us had done below expecation n what each person did b4 the exams n also give suggestions on how 2 teachers n school help us improve. Aft sch, i was chatting with Shera, Naz  Raihana, i saw Sherry. Not sure if she staring at me or not. Mayb she got SPP. Well nvm, just ignore it. Hai! Tml (Sat) is Mass Run 2004, it'll b held at Bedok Reservoir Pk, so early had 2 wake up cos it starts at 7plus in the morning.
