And we the comp was part of a judges circuit that generaly scores higher then others. But none of  that matters a damn bit. We won sweepstakes!) I think we need to keep working. I dont want us to get lazy now becouse we won an insignificant, and a tab bit imbalanced comp. Witten gave us Monday off, and i think that was a mistake. We need to keep working and keep morale and drive up. I want to win sweeps again at Savannah in two weeks, when it actually matters. I want to be able to stand our ground at the Impulse Invitational. Well, Halloween is closeing in, and I am doing jack shit for it. If any of my friends read this and want to do something then im down, but as of yet I think I might just watch somemovies or something. Probley just watch  The Nightmare Before Christmas   a bunch of times.   Matrix Revolutions is coming out in just Nine days, Fifteen Hours and Ten minutes. Anyone who wants to come with me, ill be getting my ticket on Thursday after school. Give me enough money to cover the price of a ticket and ill pick you up one. I have scout meeting Tuesday next week, but as soon as it ends (roughly nine o clock) i'll be waiting in line.   Untill then, to all the people in the world who have nothing better to do in their life then hate: Take. The. Bullet.
