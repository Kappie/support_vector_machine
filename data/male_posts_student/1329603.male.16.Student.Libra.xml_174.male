That was cool. It's a pity I was taking Arturo (Tom's Spaniard who is actually quite cool) to Sam, or I'd have talked to them for longer if they'd have let me. They're both cool... Phil's growing a beard for Les Mis ^_^ How cool.  Oh, I also went to Toby's, where we have so far composed 45 seconds of a brass band piece. It's really cool, it starts using chords based on the dorian on A, and then after a held note goes in a really cool Salsa thing. We've called it Salsa Del Charlton Kings, and after we've finished it (in perhaps a couple of months) we'll see if we can do it with CYB. Ruling.  And I'm talking to Laura ^_^. And Amy (Dorset woman) ^_^. Haven't talked to Laura in a while, though, so yay for her being on.  Quote of the day: "There's no time for us, There's no place for us. What is this thing that fills our dreams, Yet slips away from us?"  From Queen's   Who Wants to Live Forever?   Love, Jon Roskilly
