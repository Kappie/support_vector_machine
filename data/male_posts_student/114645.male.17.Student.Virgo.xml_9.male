Do you have a favorite poem? (Share it!) No More Fun, No More Love.  As I walk up the jet way, there she is, same place as always, Leaning on the wall in her brown overcoat With the biggest, brightest smile you have ever seen. Her teeth glimmered in the light,  When the sun dances on the water after a storm.  She was my grandma, and I was visiting her, Visiting her on that cold winter day.  It was cold when I went outside and got in her car. We went the same way back home as always,  But something was different, but I didn't know what.  Time passed, and we both got older. We loved each other more than I love chocolate. We would go walking together, and we loved each and every day.  She is gone now. No more fun, no more walking. The house is silent. When I come home, Judge Judy isn't on. No more planning out the week because she couldn't remember. No more fun, no more love.  4.
