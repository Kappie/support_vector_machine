Not only have I decided to take a gamble with such foreign concepts as "attending class" and "studying," but the rest of my free time has been consumed with  International Week  seminars.  In the past two days I've managed to sit in on the following sessions:    01 - The Wall In Palestine 02 - When Victims Become Perpetrators: Children of War in the Process of Peace 03 - Issues and Perspectives of Peacebuilding in West Africa 04 - Human Security: War in the 21st Century 05 - FILM - Musicians in the War Zone: A Look at the Effects of War on Children 06 - The National Missile Defense Plan: Consequences for Canadian Independence 07 - Building Sustainable Peace 08 - Edzimkulu: Rebuilding AIDS Communities in South Africa 09 - Breathing Peace (an actual seminar on rediscovering the secrets of natural breathing) 10 - Feeding off Empty Bellies: Structural Violence and the Global Economy 11 - Ending Conflict on the Roof of the World: Potential Solutions fo the Tibet Problem 12 - The Arar Case: A Public Forum 13 - Perspectives on Peace: Pride, Promises, Problems - Canada's Role in the World    That's 1010 minutes of lecture time, or just shy of 17 hours in a mere 2 days...and I've still got 3 days left!  Going to bed last night, though, would have made today run much more smoothly. I reached the sleep-deprived, nerve-rattled boiling point fairly early in my day, as a man sitting in front of me was eating walnuts  very slowly , and  very crunchily . At the time it felt like I was seconds away from going insane, but I withheld the urge to  murder  the poor soul, and slowly counted back from ten (not purposely slowly, but 'cause I was super tired) while he continued on enjoying his precious nuts.  Between seminars I stopped in the bathroom, and I really must have looked like hell to all those people around me. My eyes were bloodshot, a vacant stare glazed-over my eyes, and I was wearing army cargos, an "American Psycho" President Bush t-shirt, a ginormous wool-knit touque, and my German army parka. Either I looked like a  very  tired Faculty of Arts senior student, or a cracked-out junkie trying catch a nap indoors. The line between the two is often very blurred and indistinct.  What  did  snap me back to harsh reality, though, were the ungodly temperatures enveloping the City of Champions. On campus the mercury read -42C, and that's before the "where'd my testicles go!?" windchill effect, which made it feel closer to -50C! But really, once things dip below -30C it's so mind-numbingly cold that you begin to question just  why  our Forefathers thought this particular chunk of dirt would make a great place for a sovereign nation anyways?    Currently listening to: Hell freezing over - it's really that cold, dammit!
