Now thatll be fun but ya until then nothing too fun..hanging out...And you know what....getting your wisdom teeth out isnt as bad as people say it is...i mean besides alotta blood and soreness...its not too much to write home ABOUT...anyways...ive come to the conclusion that i definitely wont have time to keep up with this thing during school so i guess this is like the SUMMER DIARIES 2004....man that sounds like some gay disney movie but o well.... maybe i should send it in...yes?no?...  SO IMPOSSIBLE...DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL...
