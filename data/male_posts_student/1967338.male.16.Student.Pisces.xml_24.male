LC got fourth, which is disappointing compared to last year's second place, but I am still happy with a great performance. We got 6th in music and that is what dragged us down. We got 3rd in visual, and 3rd in general effect. Indy regionals and Grand Nationals will be very exciting.  Nathan: I shared your soul with Jonah and it gave me a soar throat :( Jonah: PiE! Huzzah for marching band despite the Protests of Marten and Soph Sophia: When are we gonna get a duo?! By the way, I do not post often because my posts would be pointless if I did. I only post when I have something to say.  SQEE!
