The trip to lindale was good, fireworks.... good..... trip home..... good..... still bored tho.  I'd been wanting to make a sword pole that the Blue Man Group uses for that 'swooshy' noise in their songs. I learned today that they are fiberglass rods that can bend and flex, and, couples with their light weight, make a satisfying  "woosh" noise when swung in the air.  What is a fiberglass rod, you ask?  Boat antennae(60 bucks), have a guy make it for you (100 bucks), Magicstick(25 bucks).... wait, was that 25 bucks? Yup. I found some sap that was selling what he THOUGHT was an electrician's prodding tool, but its actually an instrument used to make a noise not unlike that of a...... record scratching??? I've been hearing that bands out there are looking for a DJ soely for that sound, but i think an air pole is cooler, sounds better, and is funner to watch. Im probably also going to end up making a Drumbone (a percussive offshoot of a trombone, made with PVC pipes and connectors) by the end of the summer, if i get bored enough. That would only cost 30 bucks, what with us already having the saw, easy access to home depot, connectors and elbows not being too expensive.... I wonder how the people of home depot would think of a guy like me looking at their warehouse, not of a place of home improvement, but a music store? Hmm... I'm gonna need to think on this one.  Have you ever noticed that while you're listening to a song with a real good beat, and youre typing, you end up typing in tempo with the music? its hard, but my subconscious typing pulls it off... somehow.  skiddely wa doo wah day. Thank you.
