Well, when me, ashley, and lauryn were in the car on our way to pick up daniel, this commercial was on the radio and it was all "Have you seen Mean Girls? Well, if you haven't you should! Boys, do you know how many hot girls will be at the theatres watching it? Mean Girls is a movie you've got to see. You should go see it on a Friday night." When we heard that we were all "WTF?!" And then by the time we got to Regal, the movie had already started so we ended up seeing Shrek 2. When we got home, we found out that Shrek 2 was already playing at Chabot Cinema >.
