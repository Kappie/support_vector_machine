Anyways we just wached a couple of "scary" movies which were just fukin booring as hell and i was cold all night!!, i guess u could say i just had a sucky night, we played a little basket ball and me and lisa went rollerblading a couple of hours before people started to show up which was alright.im actually getting kinda annoyed of seeing my friends all the time, its like fukin hell i see them 5 fukin days a week and they wanna do something vertially every weekend which is fukin annoying, lol, i only was them all yesterday and they wanted me to come bowlong tonight which i so didnt want to do, so i didnt go.  on friday during school me a lisa were torturing ourselves, if u have seen teh movie "jackass" then u probly would remeber the papercut one, we kinda remade that one but we use aligaor clips which are these clips used in science, there these little clips withj these realy sharp teeth type things on them, anyways we put them all over bodies and then we would yanks them of each other without releaseing the clip so it hurt like thell adn usualy cu, i did it to my earsand i got this little cuts on my ear, lol, wehn my dad saw it he had a major shit at me lol, it was fun, me and lisa were adicted to the pain! lol.wehn my mum picked me up from lisa's house i went shopping with here and she bought me 3 new dvd's they are "American warewolf in london", "long time dead" and " the matrix reloaded, im waqching that now cuz wehn i brang it home i wached it but i fell asleep half way threough, wich is a good thing cuz then if anyone asks why i didnt go bowlong i can just say i fell aslee and didnt get up till 8pm.  one of my mums frinds came over and she has a daughter that goes to my skool in yr 7 adn she hates scary moves so i forced her to wach " long time dead" lol it is one of the sweetest movies ever, she shat her self figuratively speaking ofcourse.im soo bored and tired, in the pase 2 day i have only gotten 4 hours sleep, right now im talking to meeka and ches waiting fro me to finish this diary entry so she can read it, anyways im done writing so ..L8R......
