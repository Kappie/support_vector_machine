We got there, and we reviewed for a little, you have to love the review games we play. They are actually fun and entertaining. And then we were given time to study, and then there was two parts to the test which both had 50 questions each. Well, that was one of the easiest tests I have ever taken. I got a 100 on one of the tests and a 98 on the other. I was very happy, but then after school, I took Kyle home and then me and my sister went and picked up my brother at golf. While was getting him, I saw Tony and talked to him. Tony is an awesome kid, it was good to talk to him again. It brought back awesome memories of us hanging out at St. Pats. But then, I went home and I'm trying to remember what I did after that. Well, I ate oviously, and then my brother went to the pool, and my sister left for work. And then I just kinda hung out for awhile. Then Amanda, Natelie, Whiteny, and Kacy, and me hung out for about an hour. We stayed in someone else yard and on the sidewalk for some reason, and we played with the basketball. And then after that I had go home and eat. And then after that I really did nothing else I don't think. If I did I don't remember. But then I went to bed, and then got up on Thursday and went to school again. We reviewed for the IL Consitution Test, and then after school, I gave Ryn and Kyle a ride home, and then I had to go to the ortho because of my stupid bracket. I get all the way over there, and they are just like, "we arn't going to put it back on, you don't need it." So they just cut my wire and I left. Pointless, but then we got home. And my mom went and go food from Taco Bell which was good. And then after that I called KLT and then went to her house and then we walked up to Hollands, I bought a nasty grape shaved ice, it was sick. But then we walked back to Kristen's and just sat on her portch, or however it's spelled, and I stayed there for about an hour and a half. And then I rode home and then got online, and then I was riding to Kyles, but then Bree came out of the pool, and I stopped and talked and we ended up talking for over an hour and a half. It was a great converstion, we both said we had no lives and we are gonna hang out now since we have no lives. It should be fun, but then after that I went back home, and then got back online to tell Kyle I was finally coming over. So I rode over to Kyles and we went down stairs for awhile and then went outside. We stayed outside for a long time, and then about an hour and a half later I had to go, so I rode home. And then I ate, and then me and Kyle decided we were bored so we went to the swim meet. Stayed there for about 2 minutes because no one was there, and then we just walked back to my house. And then Amanda, Natelie, and Whitney came over and we talked for awhile, and then Kyle had to leave, and then the girls did to a little after. Then my mom left to go pick up my dad at the airport because he came home last night from his buisness trip. Then I came inside and got online and just listend to music. At around 11:00 I was jsut listening to music singing it because that's what I do, and then I decided it was time to stop and go get ready for bed, and I still hadn't studyed yet. So I got ready for bed, and then just read over my review sheet once. And then went to bed. Then I got up today and oviously went to school again, my dad took me, because he is home now like I just said, I told him to buy a lottery ticket because the Jackpot is over 290 Million. And that is just a crazy load of money which would be very nice to have, even Matt Lauer from the Today show bought over 400, he is a smart, but rich already, guy. But then my dad took me to school and I sat outside talking for a little, and then we went inside and we played another game to review for our IL Consitution Test, then he gave us time to study, and then we took the test. Again, a pretty easy test, after the test he gave us a ten minute break and we went outside like we always do and sat on the steps in the sun. Then we went back in and since the test was Scantron he had them graded and gave us our grade. I got a 100 on it so it was nice. And then after that, we watched this video. It was interesting at that lol. It was about Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court appointment and the sexual harassment that he was accused of. Well the lady who accused his said he said some pretty colorful words. She said that he said that he loved to watch porn of girls doing it with animals, and he would talk about his penis as "long dong silver" and many other worse things were said in that video. It was a very interesting video to be watching at school. But it was interesting about the case. Before we left for the day we talked about it and decided on who was lieing and who wasn't. Some think that the girl was and some others believed that Thomas was. But we haven't finished the video yet so I don't know who is yet. Thomas oviously won because he is on the Supreme Court now, but its a very interesting video. The sentors just yell and are wierd some times lol. It's interesting. But then after that my dad picked me up and I went home, and then we went to the bank, and then my dad took me and my brother and we bought some fireworks down in East Peoria at the place with the big roaster which is the coolest thing in the world, and then we came home and had lunch. And now I'm bored. So if anyone wants to do anything the rest of the day, I'm up for it. I haven't seen Spiderman 2 yet and really want to so if you want to go see that, I would love it :-D, but if you want to do something else to that's alright. I'm just sick of sitting at my house. Well I'm going to go outside before it starts raining and I am going to play some basketball. Have a great day. See-ya.
