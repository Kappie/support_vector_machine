I can blog, and everything else just fine. it has comments, i can post info about me, its allllll good.  look forward to numerous posts about how my life is and all sorts of other tidbits. I don't hold much back in a blog, tho i have learned not to tell people everything, because then they get interested and bad things happen. Keep it on the DL. yeah, i have a paper to write now, maybe another post before i go to bed.
