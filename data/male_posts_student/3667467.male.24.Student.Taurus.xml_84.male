Second, mad props to the school secretaries for keeping it real with politeness and sincerity even in the midst of the jungle. Third to my peeps on the Thruway, the toll-takers, construction workers, travel plaza associates, and miscellaneous that keep everybody moving. Fourth, everybody at the IHOP on Maple (what a coincidence, the names are!) for their high standards of quality and wide selection. And last but best of all, everyone at the many Blockbuster locations in Buffalo for their mad crazy phone tree system. We found the perfect movie at 12:30 in the morning, and couldn't have done it without the support of my B-Buster peeps on Delaware. Everybody watch "Fear of a Black Hat"!
