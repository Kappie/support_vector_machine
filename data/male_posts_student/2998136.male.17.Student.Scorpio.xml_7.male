I felt like throwing down the whole damn PC off from the window, I think twice about it and I was not concern about injuring the people below, I am scared that my dad won’t buy me another PC. I was like a mad computer whiz till today, I done numerous online scan, use Norton to scan umpteen times, I downloaded a few spyware remover. And those detected over 100 viruses, script viruses, Trojan Horse and spyware. You name it, I have it. Now everything is back to normal, I told you I am a computer whiz.  Now I have regained my internet connection, a company keeps on sending spam message to me begging me to get a diploma. The message said you need not study and take tests or exams to obtain the diploma. What the hell is this! It’s asking me to buy a piece of paper, fake certificate. I could just block the spam but I want to know how many times it can send me in a day.  Below is how the message looks like:       You know I felt like dying without Internet for the past few days, I can’t live without it. I thought of committing-suicide by hugging my monitor and CPU together and jumped off from the building. That would make me the first person in the world to die with a computer. I simply have so many nonsense to blog, I need to type rubbish out of my hand at least a day. Now my blog is  very hungry and I am going to feed it with rubbish so that its stomach won't be rumbling so badly.
