It was "allergies" that were getting to me.  right.  I was up a little too late last night.  Probably didn't help the feelings of ill.  I'm quite bored right now, just sitting around, listening to the radio. wow the station is called "K-BAY"  how creative is that?   Damn smooth rock, makes me feel like I'm .. i dont know in a department store or something.    The world is REALLY small.  This is what i've determined.  I guess I knew already, but it's weird how many people know each other.  (I know what I'm talking about, and what has sparked this realization, so that's all that matters).  It's just weird to think that everyone knows so many people... like ____ amount, and then each one of those people know ____ many people, and so on and so forth.  Pretty soon we're all related and we all have babies that look like monkeys!!!  Well.. some babies look like monkeys anyway, bless their hearts.  Black babies are really cute.  Don't you think?  Who am I talking to?  I dunno.  maybe i'm talking to a black baby, leave me alone.  Michael Jackson doesn't look black at all.  I wanna know what his deal is.  I'd like to just like.. go into Neverland, which.. by the way doesn't even look that great, and look at what his life is like.  FREAKISH no doubt.  I saw him covered on FoxNews today.  You know, where America goes for "Fair and Balanced" News.  ie- propoganda.  Nothing is balanced about FOXNews.  That's okay tho.  I think they kinda plant weird ideas into people's heads though.  Call it fair and balanced, that's fine.  What  a weird train of thought.  CHOO CHOO!   Choo-Choo-CHOOSE me.   bye:)
