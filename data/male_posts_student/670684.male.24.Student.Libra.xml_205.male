I was killed well before I had the opportunity to do this, via the word Frisbee.  How fair is it to kill the RA with Frisbee?    Scorpions - Winds of Change.  I am pathetic.    There is an inherent amount of flyshit drama that comes with working at a summer camp.  A lot of the staff gets upset with some shenanigans and tom foolery that happens with kids.  A few of the kids are jackasses, a few apathetic jackasses, but this is honestly a really good camp.  When I went to my first band camp, Jackson Jennings poured tabasco and other sundries on his cherry jello and then vacuumed it into his mouth so he could regurgitate it onto his plate.  We loved it!  But when Kevin decides to see the scientific reaction of pouring water onto Shepard's Pie, he gets admonished.  He didn't make a mess though.    I feel no need to write on a screenplay at the moment.  I finished a short two weeks ago that I am quite happy with, some of my best work to date.  Maybe that's enough for the summer...this is a nice break because I am working, and it's not just sitting in Palm Springs drinking cokes with the old folks at home and wanting to be productive.  I'm productive in some manner.  My dreams are productive.  I was in a WWE show last night, thrown through a table in a ten man tag match.  There was a girl too...don't remember who.  There's always a girl.
