OK so my step mom is like the fakiest person in the whole world like seriously i mean she has like a different face for everyone, like for me her face is "in my eyes ur just a toddler and u better do what i say" and to my dad she's like "I'm ur loving houseservent i mean housewife and me cheat on u? hell no" and to peeps at her "fancy parties" (where upper middle class peeps she knows like to pretend they're all upper class) she's all "I'm a better cook than all of the women, i'm a more loving and devoted housewife than you are, me and john's (johns my dad) relationship will last forver" and my dad, (just as fake, remember that almost all of the upper middle classmen like to fake and be everything to everyone) puts on the "HA! i got a job, a blonde for a housewife, I'm making like 20 more Grand than u are" kinda look towards all of the men, and he's like the charmer to all the women so they can take turns telling Janet how lucky she was to get him as a husband. OK so now to the meal, first we have wine tasting, even though no one is even close to a good wine taster, and never get it right they swap "intelligent" remarks about the wine, but hey i get to wine taste too so i'll stop bitching on that, so we move on to hors durves, which really taste like crap BUT remember we're upper class now so we have to pretend we like them and make remarkes about they like "too much spinitch" and crap like that, ok so now we're ready for the main meal, OH?! no turkey? no us upper class people need to pretend like we're losin whight and we'll just have some cold sandwiches with fancy mustard and "YAY!! I GET MORE WINE!" time for some toasting to the great peeps john and janet uray! (even though most peeps just want to act like they're best of friends because all rich people need to be friends ya know) so the next moring, YAY ITS CHRISTMAS!!! I start opening my presents and what do i have????! ITS A F'N ROBOT KIT!!! what do they think i am like a hardcore nerd??? I'm a sk8r who writes on the net when i'm bored, so anyway i have this ROBOT KIT!! in my hands and what do i have to tell my dad, what i think(DAD!! u idiot! what the hell did i do that makes u think i deserve a ROBOT KIT!!!) what i say( o thanks dad i'm sure i'll have fun with this) also i then i think (heheh i'll have a blast selling this on ebay) so now i think the reason he bought the kit was so he could show off to his co-workers "oh your kid got a new RC car??" "my kid got a robot kit cause he has a brain!!" so apparently he had told Peter (my uncle)  about this about 2 weeks before christmas and not wanting to be outdone Peter gets me a gift card to the discovery store for 50$!!! so this leads to the title "New Jersey Jocks" every man out there has to prove he can one-up the other and fake his moods just to be accepted, I MEAN COME ON! put the f'n testosterone away and get serious! real friends don't fake, lie and bluff their way into respect! QUIT JOCKING AROUND! QUIT THE ONE-UPMANSHIP! JUST BE YOURSELF! OMG I H8 everyone there so f'n fake i can't take it!
