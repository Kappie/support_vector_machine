I am, once again, sucked into the world of fanfiction, this time immersing myself in  urlLink Per Solumn Lacuna: By Words Alone . Terrible! Heh.   Right. I planned to zheng CQ. By making myself his gui fei. The favored concubine, in other words. See. Told ya I am getting more and more disgusting.   HaHA. When I met Gloria, I was planning to zheng her also. She was already down her block awaiting for me. I was surprised. I was planning to greet her when she comes out of the lift. No matter. I ran towards her, do the mock bow-thingy (both hands on the left waist and did a sorta-mini-squat) and exclaimed loudly "chen qie chan jian lao fuo ye. Lao fuo ye qian shui qian shui qian qian shui" (It means "the concubine pays respect to empress dowager. long live the dowager!") Gloria was laughing and laughing and laughing. Heh.   Right. I was about to greet CQ that. Ayioh! He spoilt my fun. I saw WQ and hurried over. He seems to be in a daze. Then, I sense someone besides me. I turned over and saw CQ. I was so shocked to see him there that I forgot my lines! AHHH! Qi shi wo wor!!! Heh. There goes my surprise!   Well, I did tell him later. He was like O.o o.O . Right. Heh Heh. I kept calling him Huang Shan (Emperor) and Gloria Lao Fuo Ye (Empress Dowager). Well, WQ was Xu Gong Gong (Xu Eunch). Heh.   Right. We studied in the library and I managed to study 2 Chem chapters. Oh well.   Ayiah...there ends my crazy day! I gotta get back to mah fic. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
