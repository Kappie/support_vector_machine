THE AUDACIOUS MICHAEL OWEN BACKFLICK, THE FURIOUS RUI COSTA DRIVE AND THE LAMPARD GOAL AT PRESSURE SITUATION, WILL MAKE THIS GAME A PART OF FOOTBALL HISTORY. THOUGH THERE WAS THE CONTROVERSIAL DECISION OF DISALLOWING AN ENGLAND GOAL, WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT THEM THROUGH SURELY, I THINK PORTUGAL PLAYED BETTER ATTACKING FOOTBALL. ENGLAND PLAYED WITH THE SAME SORT OF COUNTER ATTACK STRATEGY THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST BRAZIL IN 2002 WORLDCUP AND THEY PLAYED THEIR PRICE. YOU CAN'T WIN BIG MATCHES BY JUST TRYING TO CONTEND THE OPPOSITION. WELL BEING A BRAZIL SUPPORTER I WAS ECSTATIC AFTER THEIR MATCH AND I WAS ALSO VERY HAPPY LAST NIGHT AFTER THE PORTUGAL WIN. THEY MIGHT RODE THEIR LUCK A BIT BUT THEY PLAYED A GOOD ATTACKING GAME AND DESERVED TO WIN.
