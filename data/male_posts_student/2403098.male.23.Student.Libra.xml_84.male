I used to wear them simply to read, go to a movie, or if say.. I knew I'd be driving at night.  Lately, however, I feel I   need them more often.  I asked the eye doctor, after he adjusted my prescription for the third time in 5 months, why my vision was changing so rapidly.  His response was that basically he didn't know, but "we'll keep an EYE on it" No pun intended.  It's funny because it's basically just my right eye that is getting worse.  I have always had a stronger left eye.  My MIND'S eye is fuckin 20/20.. but that's another story.  He did remark that if it was diabetes, that it would be both eyes rapidly deteriorating.  On the other hand, if my vision was getting BETTER rapidly, it would mean a brain tumor could be growing behind my eyes.  YUM.  Kind of freaky to think that a brain tumor makes your eyes get better and better.  I was speaking to my mom last night about the general events of the day and the happenings in my world.  When I told her about my eye doctor appointment, I of course relayed the interesting tumor facts.  Her comments, and I quote:  "Man, talk about the good news and the bad news.  'Well sir, the good news is your vision is getting better and better.  The bad news.. you're going to die'"  Leave it to mom to be clever out of no where.    Lately, Norman has become BugFest 2004.  I don't know when ballots were out for where BugFest would be held this year, but Norman happened to win somehow.  I think we beat out Raleigh, North Carolina ONLY due to our centrally located position in the United States.  In case you're wondering there really isn't a BugFest, per say, but there might as well be because there are a HELL OF A LOT OF BUGS around for some reason.  Last night alone, there were 3 slaughters in my apartment.  They're coming in, and I don't know why.  I walk my dog and there are Junebugs EVERYWHERE.  Fluttering around at my ankles, whizzin' across the grass, dancing in the moonlight, and so on and so forth.  Spiders have joined the party too.  They're crawling on the walls of my apartment and every once in a while making their way inside.  I think they get lost.  I  had to kill a "Daddy Long Legs" the other day, and felt pretty bad.  There he was, traversing my ceiling, minding his own business, and probably just trying to get home to Mommy Long Legs, when suddenly *SMASH* dead.  I apologized to him as I flushed him down the toilet.  Another bug rode into my apartment on lauren's shoulder last night.  He just jumped on board and cruised in like he owned the place.  Death to him too.  Again.. with apologies.  I'm sorry though, I pay rent, and unless these guys wanna chip in a bit, I'm living alone as originally intended.  One particularly interesting thing about me is that I constantly personify everything.  I call it interesting, you might call it annoying, but then I might call you a piece of shit.. so whatever, we all have our opinions.  To each his own.  Anyhow, personification.  As I mentioned the convention seems to be in town and the Junebugs are out in FULL force.  One such Junebug was walking through my apartment the other day, just browsing around my carpet.  I was trying to tell lauren this (for SOME reason) and the story escalated to the point of insanity.  You know, the type of conversation you only could hope that the government is tapping into and thinking they've finally pegged some terrorist using code language about junebugs to plan some attack.  So here's this Junebug, coasting along, and I had no heart to kill him.  I've killed before and it would seem I would be able to kill again, easily, but no.  So I got a paper towel and placed him out on the balcony to once again be out in his own element.  In telling the story to lauren, however, the Junebug somehow became a mayor.  With a closer look, I imagined the reason I spared his life was because he was dressed so dapper.  He was wearing a BIG mayor hat, carrying a septor of sorts, and kinda marching along.. not really walking.  I imagine that he will take the paper towel I removed him with back to his people as proof that he did indeed travel to foreign lands.  Much like the Wizard going back to Kansas, he will tell his people of his travels and the great things he saw on my carpet.  They will admire him, re-elect him, consider him their hero, and then build a house for him out of that very paper towel.  One day I will be walking Boomer and I will pass that house, and see Mayor Junebug of June-Bug City giving me a thumbs up.  We'll both smile, laugh a bit, and wink at each other.
