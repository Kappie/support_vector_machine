There were tons of ppl and overall i think that it went really well. They showed a video of the camp that was like from 10 years ago so of course i didnt recognize anyone on it. It was like dang thats really old yet on the video the camp basically looks the same. So i met a bunch of ppl, saw some old friends, and enjoyed the time of fellowship. After i got home and went to bed at like 3:00 am for some reason. Saturday- Whoa boy i cant say much for this day except that i woke up at 3 and like i was really dazed and dizzy. Sunday- Went to church and during sunday school we acted out the book of Esther which was extremely fun schtuff. Our parts included the dateing game and a movie showing of "Woman On A Mission." So i got home and stayed there until i went out to Chevys for dinner which was really yummy yummy yummy but not so free. O and by the way im still really jet lagged from the trip...
