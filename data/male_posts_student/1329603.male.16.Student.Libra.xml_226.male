My feeling? I reckon she's going to urge me to stop talking to Becky on behalf of her. Why do I think this? Partly because I'm the 3rd most annoying person I know, and partly because I'm just a wanker. Let's face it. Not the wanking, though. Yuck.  Went to Aroma today with 'the gang'. T'was moderately cool, though Cieran and Curtis didn't show up. These people with C in their names, I ask you. Yeah, walked round with everyone, then lost Scott and Marx in WHSmiths and so the number was depleted by 2. As is usual the Scott/Marx-less group wandered around aimlessly into RGames and the Software Store. Funfunfunfunfun.  Oh, and apparently Gwen's a senior! Well done her for doing something I have absolutely NO idea what it means.  If you're free (you being indefinite from typing but definite to who's reading, especially if it's Laura) on the 13th of June (Sunday), then CYB are playing in the bandstand in Montpellier, with me doing a trombone solo called "The Joker". I wanna have someone come and gimme a hug for playing well... preference need not be mentioned!  Quote of the day: "And I know it's only in my mind... That I'm talking to myself, And not to him. But although I know that he is blind, Still, I say, There's a way for us."  From   On My Own   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
