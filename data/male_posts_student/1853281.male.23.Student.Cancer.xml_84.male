This mostly consisted of a lot of quacking and waddling back and forth...three or four drakes in a little circle around one duck. The drakes would occasionally charge eachother with a great show of puffing out feathers and quacking and a little waddle dance which probably looks mean and tough to them, but to me looked like people trying to "boogie" at a wisconsin wedding. the duck sat contentedly preenin, occasionaly quaacking out encouragement as if to say" come and get it fellas, you know you want it." On the other side of the bridge and apparent duck couple walked back and forth on the shore looking at the courting drakes and seeming to laugh. Isn't love grand.  night class tonight, of course, on the day it gets to like 63 i have to walk not through the park, but down washington, across a highway and through a concrete university. I love my life.
