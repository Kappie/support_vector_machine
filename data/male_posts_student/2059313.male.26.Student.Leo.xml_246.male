So I'm making myself happy.  No one else has done it.  At least no one on earth.  I can't take complete credit.  Sometimes I need to listen to my heart more than my mind.  I need to open up, and not be afraid to get hurt.  There's no way to actually shield myself completely from that, anyway, so why try?  At least with friends, the healing can happen quicker than if I keep myself closed off.  Also, the last Well service that I'll be able to attend happened tonight, and afterwards, a Christmas Party that we had prepared.  I think it went really well.  To me, it was part funeral, part celebration, but total dedication and thanksgiving.  That service is what got me involved at Crossroads, those people are the ones who pulled me into their lives, and those lives that gave me a home when and if there was no other.  I know that I'm going to have to let it go... and like dealing with a lost loved one... I'll mourn and then I'll move on.  I had a couple people come up to me tonight to express their excitement that I was a part of that place, and that my skills and energy were looked forward to being integrated into the regular weekend services and the church as a whole.  This was all originally thanks to two people: long-time friends - Ben Stewart and Stephanie Seales.  Without their encouragement, I wouldn't have come as far as I have, as fast as I have.  Thank you.  Now that just has to give you the feeling that something is going right for you.
