Ah, curious friend, Thou puzzelst me.”  Am I delusional enough to have imagined that these people were ignoring me? Am I delusional enough to have imagined this so well that I did not realize until last night that I was the one ignoring them? I really do not  think so, but that is basically what happened. All this week, I have had this idea in my head that a few of my friends do not want to talk to me anymore, or that there is something going on that is making them act differently around me. I still do not know what is going on, but now I am almost completely sure that no one was ignoring me, and that I was imagining that. Of course, if that is possible, then is it not also possible that I have been imagining everything?   “For each ecstatic instant,  We must an anguish pay In keen and quivering ratio To the ecstasy. For each beloved hour Sharp pittances of years, Bitter contested farthings, And coffers heaped with tears.”  “If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain.  If I can ease one life the aching, Or cool one pain, Or help one fainting robin Unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain.”  “Much madness is divinest sense,  To a discerning eye; Much sense the starkest madness.  ‘T is the majority in this, as all, prevails. Assent, and you are sane;” Demur,- and you’re straightaway dangerous, And handled with a chain."
