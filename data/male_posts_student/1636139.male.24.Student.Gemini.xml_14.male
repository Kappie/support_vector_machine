After being informed by my friend Nathan Babcock of an exciting conference being held in Palo Alto, I signed up for it. So I'll be attending the Accelerating Change conference on Sept 12-14 :-)  
There's also this O'Reilly Mac OS X conference at the end of Oct that I'm looking at but I don't need to sign up for it until Sept 15 so I think I'll wait until I'm actually down there before making plans for that one, since it takes place during the workweek, rather than on a weekend.
