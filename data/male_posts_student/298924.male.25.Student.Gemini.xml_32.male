Today....I flunked a test for the first time in Med School....it sucks to get a 54....especially after you studied your ass off....  The Yankees are like Cockroaches, can't get rid of them....  I found a hilarious Osama Bin Ladan vs. Mr. T website the other night but I can't find it now....oh well....  I'm not in a particularly good mood now so I'll be out...later!
