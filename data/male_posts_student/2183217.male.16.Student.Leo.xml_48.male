Not only does it smell like someone puked in a sac of shit and shot it all over the bus, but theres all these retards yelling and pushing everyone. The bus driver then turns the heat on to about 95 degrees so everyone sweats and it gets wiped on you. Everyones school bag are packed to the rim so don't try to move around in any fashion. Oh yeah and don't forget the people that get on the bus on the way . These people include, Horrible french quebecers with BEAVERS on theyre head... I swear to god.. Ok wtf is it 1860? i really don't think its necessary to wear animal carcusses on your head in the middle of fall anymore sir...What makes it even better is I have to take it all the way to the end of the line and catch another STINKING bus there thats just as bad except its filled with delusional oldies who never know whether theyre coming or going. They always have about 40 grocery bags with them and expect you to give them your seat...YOU SNOOZE YOU LOSE OLD TIMER!  Ninjas : 1 ; Oldies : 0
