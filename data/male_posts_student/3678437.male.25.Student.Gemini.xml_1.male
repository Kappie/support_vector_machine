Secondly, I read that Johnson was married in Saudi Arabia. I wasn't aware that Christian weddings were allowed in the country. Hmm...live in a country for sixteen years and you still have no idea about it. I know a few Christian friends who held covert Sunday services, but then again they were Indian like me, and the only skin the Saudis will kowtow to is White.   Speaking of which, in all the hubbub about the seventeen people killed in Khobar, few paid attention to the fact that most of the dead were non-Westerners, Indians in fact.
