Hermes gave her a golden box and told her to never open it.  Hera gave her curiosity.  Pandora was then sent to Earth.  For many years, Pandora wondered what was in the golden box. She was very curious.  Eventually, she opened it, thinking that the secret to life was in the box, but many foul creatures flew out, some of which were sorrow, disease, and pain.  She slammed the box shut, then peeked inside.  There was one creature left which escaped.  This creature was hope.  Always remember that whenever there are hard times or wherever there is foul kind, there will always be hope.
