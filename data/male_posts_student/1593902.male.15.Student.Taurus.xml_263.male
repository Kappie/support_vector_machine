Cereal for supper is awesome. Sugar puff, chunky marshmallows, and peanut butter pieces are children's other food groups. But then again, it wasn't always the cereal itself. It was the neat little box it came with. The back contained fun games and puzzles. The sides contain recipes, coupons, and nutrition facts that nobody can read even today.  How a cereal is discovered is by it's advertising, and what's important in advertising is what it's trademark character is. How can we relate to him? How likeable is he? The characters on the cereal boxes have become icons of our childhood, and today, we count down the top 10 cereal box characters.  Before we get into it, I just want to guarantee that all of the really stupid characters aren't on the list. These include that Honeycomb Monster, the Coco Puffs Bird, the Cocoa Crisps Monkey, the Corn Pops Porcupine and Wendell. I have excluded the Flintstones as well, mainly because kids loved them before they had a cereal. Now, on with the list:     Ah, yes. The good Cap'n. He led kids into sea with promise of peanut butter corn puffs, taking them on wild adventures with dinosaurs, pirates, and icky, icky monsters. Cap'n Crunch cereal is pretty much terrible, with hard, jagged edges that torn up the top of your mouth. Still, I kept eating it in thinking that I would get crunchitized by the Cap'n.  In the last ten years, the Cap'n has dealt with quite a bit. A while ago, he had this whole big adventure where he had to protect this island from evil monster-things-monsters. You got this CD game with a couple of proofs of purchases, where you played against the monsters in skateboarding compitions. How drugged out was that? The Cap'n would get a higher standing if his cereal didn't suck so much, but remember, we'll always love the Cap'n.     We don't know much about the bee, other then he always has a bowl of his cereal on him. In fact, he constantly persuades people with that same bowl, which usually means that the person has to stop what he's doing to eat the honey-honey-yum-yum. We've seen the bee stop the Big Bad Wolf from eating Little Red Riding Hood, stop a barber from giving a man a haircut, and stop a princess from kissing a frog.  What gives the bee such power of persuasion? We might never know. What we do know is that the bastard is rich. He's got his own Marcy's balloon, his own race car, and his own airplane. In our early childhood, rich means good, so we all loved him. His may do questionable things, but that doesn't stop us.     Three guys that live with each other, making cereal, that talks when covered in milk. Riiiiight... Well, these guys are pretty well known. One's a chef, another's a band leader, and the third is a, um.. sailor, I think.They all look equally gay. The "Three Men In A Tub" of the cereal world, these guys are never seen apart. Their cereal is alright, almost melting in your mouth. And. Yeah. Rabbit. Stuff. What else can I say about them. Um....  Rice Krispie Treats. That's why I put them in the list at all. Rice Krispie Treats rock. Suger-packed rice cakes. Yeah     These guys were the villains of the cereal world, going out of their way to steal those boxes of delicious cookie goodness. Their actions were justified, of course. Who wouldn't want to eat bowls upon bowls of tiny chocolate chip cookies? We were always rooting for them, and unlike the Trix Rabbit, they even managed to get some cereal. Their main obstacle was the Cookie Cop, your standard Keystone Cop stereotype, only he protected the world's biggest vault of mini-cookies in cereal boxes.  Today, only the dog is around, trying his hardest to spread the "COOOOOKIE CRISP!" around. Where the bandit and the cop is is unknown, but some expect their still going at it past the Mexico border.     He was the bird that taught us to follow our noses, which, according to this tropical bird, would either lead you to great fruit or great adventure. Tucan Sam was the #1 exposure of tropical wildlife to any standard city kid. I wouldn't know what a tucan is if it wasn't for him. His cereal wasn't so great. Like Cap'n Crunch, Froot Loops were sharp like frickers. I swear, if I could properly see the top of my mouth, it would have more scars then Michael Jackson's face.  Tucan Sam also had his own set of kids/nephews or something like that, making him sort of an Uncle Donald to them. They weren't as misbehaved as Huey, Dewy and Lewy, so Tucan Sam is soft inside, but's he's still a cool guy, and the top bird of cereal.     Ladies and Gentlemen, the scariest cereal logo in the world. Who here hasn't had nightmares about him? I still have dreams of being eaten by the guy. But then again, I have dreams about getting eaten by everything. So, why does such a scary man get such a high spot on my list? He made scary relatives look harmless. Hey, if a picture of a scary quaker man can improve the relationship among families, then it's all good with me.     Out of all the guys we've looked at today, Lucky had the best cereal. Of course, there was the whole matter of getting the cereal. Lucky is a crafty little devil with magic up his sleeves. It takes an effort, but those kids almost always gets the Lucky Charms. Even though he tried to avoid people, we all loved Lucky. Lucky was Lucky was Lucky.  He was never angry. In fact, even while he was being chased by hordes of stupid animated kids, he had a smile on his face. He showed us how to "Don't Worry, Be Happy Now!" Plus, my ex-girlfriend is of irish decent, thus I have to promote him highly. I guess that's why they call him Lucky.     Count Chocula is by far the coolest monster to come out of Planet Cereal. While he was teamed up with such guys and Boo Berry and Frankenberry, he was the obvious leader of the pack. While his later reincarnation made him a goofy guy, his first version was intended to scare off kids, which didn't work. In fact, kids were drawn to him by the truckload. Maybe it was because he had no proper fangs. Or maybe because he ate chocolate.  Count Chocula is not only on my top 3 cereal character list, but also on the top 3 most lovable vampires, right up there with The Count and Duckula. Making two lists makes the world go round.  (Note that I've spelt things pretty good so far!)     Heeeee's GRRRRRRRREEEEAT! Tony has been an icon for all kids. He's shown us how to work our best at sports, how to become strong and fast, and how to beat your fellow friends at everything you do: By giving you bowls of stereotype-packed Frosted Flakes. Who needs exercise and a good diet when you got those surgery paper-thin flakes. Even the fattest, clumsiest kids could become gold medal winners with just a single bowl of the great stuff.  Tony the Tiger believed in sharing his mighty cereal of the gods, and that's why he gets my #2 spot. Congrats, Tony!     And, coming in first place is the trickster of Trix himself, the Trix Rabbit. Nobody knows his real name. All they know is that he wants one thing: Trix. He's got to get his Trix. Nobody knows for sure why he wanted it originally. Maybe it was the great taste, maybe for it's wide range of colors. Whatever the reason was then, his motivation now isn't to get the Trix anymore. It's to get those damn kids to shut up.  "Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids." This is the sentence that haunts the rabbit everywhere he goes. When he walks down the street, kids beat the quote into his brain. "Trix are for kid, Trix are for kids, TRIX ARE FOR KIDS!!!!!" There is only one way to prove them wrong: by getting the Trix. Recently, he's left his kid-tricking ways and have been entering contests to win the cereal fair and square, and several times, he's succeeded, but THOSE KIDS. THOSE KIDS STOLE THE TRIX FROM HIM! THOSE BASTARDS!  I feel for the rabbit. I believe he should get his Trix and live in peace. I'd deliver the Trix to him myself if I knew where he lived. People, help a guy out, and give a rabbit some cereal.
