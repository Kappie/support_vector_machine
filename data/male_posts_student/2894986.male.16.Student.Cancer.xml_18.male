I guess Greeks aren't cool enough to clap their hands for Jesus. So I guess I'll tell you where it comes from. We have Ray Boltz to thank for this also, along with the many other great things he has opened our eyes to. Haha.   Greg downloaded the live version of "Watch the Lamb." At the beginning and end of the son Ray talks to the audience. At the beginning he tells them why he decided to sing about Jesus. "Because there is nothing greater to sing about," he says. Then at the end he goes all holy on us. He tells us to 'clap your hands for Jesus Christ the Son of God right now'. And as Ray said, no christian musician gave his life for us, Jesus did. So true. Haha.
