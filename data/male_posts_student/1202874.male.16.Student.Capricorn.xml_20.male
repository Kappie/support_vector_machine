I AM NOT THE OTHER DARK MEAT! anyways today i talked to someone i haven't seen in a long while: colleen bojarski. in 7th grade we started talking like a month before she left to aurora schools. she was angie's friend and i thought she was hot. what else did you really care about in 7th grade? personality? sophistication? inner beauty? hell no, are you kiddin me. but yeah i saw her at bedford's world famous rib burn-off 2 weeks ago. but very cool deal... tomorrow i'm going to get my temps packet from the dmv. thats definitely sweet. on the otherside of that, driver's ed is starting for me in a couple weeks. 3 or 4 hours a week watching videos of people getting pulled out of accidents. yay! can't wait for that... so today as i was browsing through a myrtle beach golf magazine one of them caught my eye: "Myrtle Beach's most prestigous tee time awaits you at 'The Granddaddy.' From our fleet of  Rolls Royce  golf carts, to the starters clad in authentic Scottish kilts." rolls royce golf carts?! thats truly pimpin. i just got my mercedes benz scooter yesterday, complete with rims... i wish  well some good ole real world paris is on mtv. Adieu.
