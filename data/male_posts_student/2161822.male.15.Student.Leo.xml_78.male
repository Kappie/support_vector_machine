It really is pointless when the teacher needs to ask the kids if he's doing a problem correctly. For example, today we spent the entire class doing 2 problems. They're pretty difficult, but with some thinking you could figure them out. Well our teacher is doing the problem on the board and completely messing it up. Everyone sort of just looks at him and pretends like he's doing it right until someone tells him he f'd it up. Then he replies, "What?! How? What do you mean? How do I do it?" I don't know why he's even there since I can learn the same things by reading the book. (Which is what I end up doing anyway) And when he does take the time to explain a problem, he does it wrong and ends up confusing us more. So after a grueling, annoying period today, I'm walking out and as I walk out I overhear him say "(looking at the book)What is this? I don't know how to do these." Other than that, the day was somewhat tolerable. I was surprised to leave the building and find it to be warm outside. So I took advantage and played basketball. Until my stupid orthodontist appointment where I find out that I think I need braces. Great. Just great. So that sorta killed the rest of the day until I got to driver's theory which  always  brightens a day. (sarcasm) We did however get to watch some cool videos (sarcasm) like a funny one about airbags. I'm not sure when the topic of airbags became comical, but whatever. And after driver's theory I am here. And now after a long post for today I will be merciful and end it here.  Listen to H.I.M.
