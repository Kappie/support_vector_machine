I used to be SO "live and let live" in my outlook.  I guess I just never realized that you people actually hate ME for no reason.. so now it's MY turn, only I actually have a reason, unlike your "reason" which is hating my views of "freedom" (for the record, I PERSONALLY would never have harmed you, pressed my opinions on you or hated you for not agreeing with my freedom-oriented views, because afterall, I didn't want you over in my country anyway, we're all full up here.  STAY in your country and make oil for me, and rape women, I don't care).  BUT NOW, now I have a reason, and it's been building for a couple years *ahem, 9/11* and I'm tired of it.  I  Just read a story in the news about an ambush in Fallujah, Iraq that killed NON-military Americans, and the townspeople dragged the American's bodies through the streets, mangled them, hung their corpses from a bridge, and rejoiced proclaiming that Falluja is the cemetery of Americans.  Come on down to Oklahoma you piece of shit, I'll show you a cemetery.  I'll show it to you slowly, and I'll show it to you with my bare hands.  I think I could find a bridge to hang you from, the Highway 9 bridge is just a short walk from my door.  Anyhow, I hope everyone is pissed now, it was my goal.  :)  You see, I am a caring person, I don't wish harm on anyone, but provoke me, hate my 'people' for no reason, kill my countrymen, wish harm on me without knowing me, and hate me for beliefs I would never wish for you to share, and it's war.  Keep it up Iraq, and burn in hell when you're done.  I only hope the leaders of MY country assist in getting you to said hell a tiny bit faster.  Have a good day!:)  ***Disclaimer:  I know that "me hating an entire race, based on one news story, is as bad as people who hate all Americans (even those innocent) based on certain beliefs."  I am not seriously hating an entire race, but this blog expresses my views, beliefs, and feelings at the time of posting them.  I am pissed, I do have feelings, and I have very real emtions just as any human being would.  Much love to my friendly Iraqi friends.  I have plenty of love for all kind and decent human beings.  My views have simply been hardened towards others, whereas before I had love for anyone in the world until they proved themselves not worthy.  I now feel as though I am hated for things I can not personally even control, such as how the country I was born into intereacts in world affairs.  With that said, don't get your panties in a wad.***
