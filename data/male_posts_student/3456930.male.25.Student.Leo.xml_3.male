Makes an old man feel good. *Grin*  Was getting a little freaked out when I hadn't heard from my parents first thing this morning. Was expecting a 5:30am wake up call. But, as I found out, my parents were busy unpacking their belongings in Grafton. Yep. They've finally moved. The house has been on the market for a week and a half and it looks like it'll be sold by the end of next week. So they've done it. They've taken the first step to... well... the coast. Hmmm... not really the first step. More like the last, I suppose. But, anyways, they've finally done it. So that explains the lack of communication.  Okay, I know what you're all asking: "Shut up with the thanks and tell us what ya scored!!".   Well, I got a REALLY REALLY nice watch. Let's just say that it was expensive and leave it at that, shall we? BLOODY nice watch! And I got a hooded, zip-up, jumper. I don't know the official name of it but it's something you'd get from General Pants. That sort of thing. It's really really nice too. I've been looking at something like that for a while. So now I'll be able to say that I'm now hip and cool. And really mean it! LOL  My flatmates are taking me out to dinner tonight but, unfortunately, I can't get absolutely wasted because I have to be up at 5am tomorrow to start work at 7am. Tough luck for me...   Mum feels bad that they didn't get me anything but, really, I'm not too worried. Just as long as their happy. That's what counts. Besides, I know that I can use it as blackmail material for the next 5 years at least. *evil grin* No, seriously, I'm just glad they finally did something about the itchy feet...  But seriously... 5 years. Oh yeah. I can see the stuff I can wrangle out of them already... LMAO  Anyways, I gotta go to uni now so I'll talk to you all later.   Lowman X, out.
