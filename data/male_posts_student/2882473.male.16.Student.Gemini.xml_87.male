But most importantly, a time for blogging, as I will have written my 100th post.   Oh, Dave, we reeeealy haven't got time for you to be blogging now, yeh? I mean, we have sixth form starting in just 6 weeks and we still have a ton of work to get through now. I reeeealy need you to engage with this... believe me yeh?  Aaaanyway. More about that when the time comes. If it comes. Who knows? We could wake up dead tomorrow....  Right, there has been a recent lack of posts in the past few days, mainly because I haven't been doing much other than alternating between the computer, reading, and sad stuff (ie chess, morse code, writing with left hand etc). And that is not really worth blogging about. But today was different. Oh yes, very different. For today I went out with friends!!! (that deserves at least 3 exclamation marks) The last time this happened was... July 7th, on that memorable trip to the science and natural history museums in London.   Well, today a trip to London had also been planned, with me, megatrobe, deutsches and rob having a wander. So, here is a detailed account of how the day went. Enjoy! We all met on a train from Hayes to Charring Cross; of which I got on at Clock House, after getting a tram from Beckenham Junction. The train was delayed by 10 minutes, so there was no need to panic when the tram was just sitting in Beckenham junction doing nothing before it left.  Arriving at Charring Cross at preciesly 10:22, we made our way out of the station, across the road to Trafalgar Square, where we got photos of Thunderbird 3, as well as ones of us climbing the lion statues. Next we took a walk to St Stephens Tower (which houses Big Ben) and walked past parliament en route to a small area of greenery by the Thames. A significantly longer walk took us to Buckingham Palace, which had hundreds of people crowded outside, trying to get a glimpse of the changing of the guards, with loads of police around, some with heaftry machine guns it looked like.   Next a walk to Hyde Park Corner, narrowly avoiding an angry cyclist on the way; we saw Marble Arch, then got a tube to Canary Warf, as Dave knew a good place to eat near there, and we were all getting hungry (except jon for some reason...) Anywho, tube to canary warf, and Docklands Light Rail to some place nearby to go for a short walk to a nice Chinease restaurant. All you can eat for £5.90, plus a glass of water making it up to £6.90. And I ATE DUCK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. Not too bad actually. Plus lots of other stuff.   Realising how far it was to Canary Warf, we walked back there, passing some novelty sized apple sculptures made from grass and computer cables. Some more photos. Next was a tube to Oxford Street, where in Virgin Megastores I desired to purchase the Two Towers soundtrack for £5.99, very good value. Also had a go on the keyboards, as well as Spiderman 2 for PS2. [At this point The Dave stops blogging to have some dinner] We then went into Cost Coffee in Virgin for a drink and rest from walking all day.  Leaving Virgin, we saw Tottenham Court Road tube station across the road, meaning we needn't have walked nearly all the way down Oxford Street from Bnd Street Station. Here we got another tube to Tower Hill (not direct) so we could catch a glimpse at the Tower of London as well as Tower Bridge, which we walked across.   And then it was suggested by me that a walk along the south bank of the river to Charring Cross would be a good idea, where we could then go home, but after getting only about 1/4 of the way, decided to go to London Bridge instead, much nearer, as we were all very tired. Here we just missed a train home, but got another 10 minutes later.  A 15 minute walk home from Clock House and I was home at last, 8 hours 45 minutes after I left. (09:15 - 18:00) A quick shower was in order, and then a blog. And here I am.   A generally fun day, which I feel we must do more often. I need to get out the house more after all.  In other news, I started reading 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' last night, which seems to be fairly good. All about grammer and how many people don't know how to use it. Probably qite useful too.  That shall be all for now.  Ta ta all.    Weather:  Sunny, cloudy, warm. A spot of rain on the way home. Now overcast.  Reading:  Fellowship of the Ring, Eats Shoots and Leaves  Listening to:  Two Towers Soundtrack - The Riders of Rohan  Watching:  Little  Confused about:  Why I get aching legs after walking  Annoyed with:  Being unfit  Mood:  Quite happy. Maybe even proud. 'Twas a good day
