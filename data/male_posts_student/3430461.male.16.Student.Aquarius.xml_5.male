My name is Bill and I live in Chelmsford, in Essex. I'm 16 years old and I go to Great Baddow Hiâ€¦ Sports College. I play the trumpet and piano (just passed my grade 8 trumpet yippee). I listen to jazz and classical music (sneer if you must) and play in quite a few bands/orchestras.  I am not at all normal, in that I am not your average grumpy 'Kevin' teenager, but then again neither are my friends (of which I would love to include whoever you are, unless you're horrible. Then I blow a raspberry in your face thrrrrrrp). My interests are music, electronics, physics, maths etc. and also the one of the masters of sci-fi fantasy Terry Pratchett, the others being Tom Holt and Robert Rankin. Like I said, not your average teenager.  I have a brother (20, in the merchant navy, drives cruise ships, yippee, free cruises for me), a sister (21, at Cambridge doing History, in her last year) and a mum and a dad. My mum is a secretary for Farleigh Hospice, and my dad teaches maths at my school. My mum used to teach there, which is where they met. I'm the result of a staff room romance. Sigh.  Thats enough of that... Right now (well, obviously not right now, but you know) I'm doing my GCSEs which is of course why I am now wasting time bloging away here. Oh well.  To explain the name Bilbo. OK, yes, it is the name of one of the characters from JRRTs books, but it has nothing to do with that. I am not short fat and with hairy feet (well, perhaps a little hairy) but I do have a big appetite. Anyway, at a music course I was on, someone said "Hey, Bill, Bilbo!" and it stuck. The stupid address is becase the same person thought that obliBsniggaB (BilboBaggins backwards) was excruciatingly funny. Besides, who else would have the name of their site oblibsniggab. The title of my blog, 'Absolvi meam animam' means 'I got that off my chest' in Latin. I didn't work it out myself; I've got a list as long as...erm...something very long of Latin phrases like 'I've got to see a man about a dog' and 'Beam me up, Scotty'.  Well, I should probably leave it at that for the moment, and perhaps I can go out and get a life now. Ho hum...
