I’ve heard all about this book through the years; it’s been alluded to in many of my favorite books and movies. Since I’ve had some spare time in the last few days I picked this book up and decided to give it a try. Now that I’ve finished it I consider it to be one of the best.   Salinger’s main character is Holden Caulfield who is a very troubled teenager. The reader eventually sees that Holden’s account of his own problems is unreliable. The most important clues as to the causes of his problems is only briefly mentioned if at all; when one considers these clues and the entirety of his actions one sees that Holden is desperately searching for an intimate connection. Unfortunately, his self-destructive behavior often gets in the way.  There are several great ideas presented in this book the first of which is the human need for intimacy. Holden oftentimes is unaware of his own motivations saying he’s “a madman” whenever he reaches out to others, every time ultimately ending in failure. I feel that this message is particularly important for young men. Our society and most of the world instills in boys a stoic, emotionless quality; this gender socialization, in my mind, really inhibits men and makes them more prone to mental and other health problems as is evident with Holden.   Another great idea from the character Mr. Antolini is the observation that some people, like Holden, are in a terrible kind of fall where they are unable to see or feel themselves fall. Mr. Antolini’s advice addresses the dramatic irony of the book, namely that the reader realizes Holden’s terrible fall while Holden himself does not. Salinger suggests that one needs the external environment to help us realize when one has fallen; Holden does not realize his fall because “feeling” and “seeing” are both sensory perceptions stimulated by the external environment, of which Holden is detached.   The interesting title of the book represents Salinger’s last great idea, namely that an essential part of life is being there for others. When pressured by his sister to name one thing he’s interested in Holden can only say that he imagines a person catching other people running through the rye field who would otherwise fall over a nearby cliff. Holden finally finds a connection with his younger sister who keeps him from running away. As a medical student this message has been one of my central motivations. No matter how screwed up my own life is I can give my experiences more meaning by helping others.   I highly recommend reading The Catcher in The Rye. We can all relate in some form to Holden’s “life-at-a-crossroads” experience. Personally, after having finished my freshman year at medical school I found myself sympathizing with Holden at times, for there were times when I felt that I didn’t give a crap for anyone in my class. Everyone seemed “phony” to me, but unlike Holden I realize that I need to be more tolerant and not as quick-to-judge. While these are my own interpretations at this stage of my life, this novel no doubt has some important messages for everyone at various stages of life.
