Awwww computers are evil and mean and mean and evil. W00t, firewall is back. Hey Mark does anyone read your blog? Do they see what I write to you? =/ Mwahaha.. you deleted your username, you should have blamed it on the hackers, said that they did it.. I could have sent you some of your stuff back to you.. but just the other day I put everything onto zip disk - which meant I deleted a lot of videos and pictures etc. I still have some of your stuff.. hehe I kept it. =/ Don't know why. I hoarde things a lot.. hoarde = spelt wrong and basically collect a lot of stuff... you fixed your computer now though... right?? hehehe you're bored... awwwww. *hands over another play toy* seem to have gotten bored of the last one. I'd play hide and seek with you. But hey you're in Manchester. Why is everyone who is nice to me live away!? No fair. *stamps feet like a little child* hahaha I stole that offa you. No seriously anyone who's nice to me lives away from me. Hey maybe that's ...well.... telling me something. You're around me for more than a few weeks and you just end up hating/disliking me... ah well... ummm.... I wrote enough... byebyes.
