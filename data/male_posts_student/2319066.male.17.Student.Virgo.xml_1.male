Though, today we did have turkey.  It was a trash can turkey.  This is a really cool way to cook a turkey.  When the turkey is done, it is jucier than turkies that are cooked in the oven.  It also is done a lot quicker.  No matter what size the turkey is, it will be done in 90 minutes.  My dad found this in a camping cook book.  Well, that is all for now.  See ya!
