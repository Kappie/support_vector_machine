That I'm not? I'm talking about my writing. I'm not going to go on leaving you in a lurch, attempting to decipher a coded message like other writers do, coz it's "stylistic" and "impressive". Pseudo-Shat my man, pseudo-shat!  backlogged assignments tug gently. You know, like something that persists, but doesn't affect you. They will soon. That's life, the way things are, it's a cycle, and wheels of such have to come full-circle.  There's a lot on my mind, about life, love and music. My passions, I pray remain with me. I'm listening to Killer Queen by Queen. That's music. I love it.! I LOVE IT!!!  Dawn will be on TV tomorrow. Friends. I got a little (pretty large) gift for Leon. He's bound to like it.  Smallville is on. Weird thing to say after intellectual jargon. Shut up.  I love you.
