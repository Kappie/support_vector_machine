Today I had a  urlLink Japanese  test which I totally failed-- I was half awake, feeling like crap and I didn't have enough time to finish it.  It was horrible. Saturday, there is a  urlLink Taiko  performance at the museum of civilization.  I hope I get to see it- I really enjoy the sound.  Post more soon,  -Ryan
