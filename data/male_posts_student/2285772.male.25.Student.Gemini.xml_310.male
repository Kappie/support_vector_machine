(kinda like when i was little and all my friends had a nintendo, but my parents wouldn't let me have one)  on the brightside, i've got a date with emily tonight. it'll be the first 2nd date i've had since last fall. i dunno though. i feel like i've already hit my usual 1 or 2 week interest limit. we'll see....
