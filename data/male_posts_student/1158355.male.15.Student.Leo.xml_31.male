Running outside for 30 minutes with only a t shirt and shorts. Smart guy aint I. Ok, that's all. oH wait, no its not. i stayed after till 5:10 with paul, crystal f and dana d who I've been sitting next to in Italian since 7th grade. I think ms lazarus thinks we're married or something. She's been putting us in the seats next to each other for 2 years! I got home... uh... Damit! what was I going to say!
