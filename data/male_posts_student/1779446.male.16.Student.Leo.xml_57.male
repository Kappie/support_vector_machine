A quote from the text that Michael made me aware of "The epileptic seizures were said to be caused by the incessant flashing lights in the cartoon overloading the optical nerves and inciting seizure; however, seizures can also be caused by demonic attack."  Do I really need to prove my point? This shit was probably written by a group of Nazi-style Christians. I got two words for this "Bullshit Propaganda".
