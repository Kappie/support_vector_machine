They have no social skills so they feel the need to repeat ridiculously long comedy routines that nobody wants to hear in order to try to get attention. They frequently enter a conversation with, "Ahh dude I just thought of something funny." Grr.    Truck Trader  reader:  Why are kids always reading this damn thing? When they don't even have a license? Yeah...it's a magazine...where people sell trucks. They look at it in pairs, saying what they see: "Dude, it's an F-150!" "Dude, it's a Dodge!" That's right. Same for paintball people, reading their silly  P8NT  magazine: "Oh my god, Angel!" "w00t, Phantom!" Grr.   Guy who has heard of every band imaginable:  No matter what band you mention, no matter how obscure, no matter if they even exist or not, this person has fucking heard of them and been to one of their shows. Sometimes they'll get real clever and throw in a "Dude I moshed so hard" or something like that. Grr.   Spontaneous Rapper:  Some of these African Americans (C) just HAVE to be rapping some horrible fucking song at ALL TIMES, with their headphones around their neck way too loud. Nobody wants to fucking hear it. Grr.
