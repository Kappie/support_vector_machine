I mean, there have been many times like the story Iwas told by a friend of mine. A car was reversing into a parking space, with another car coming up behind it. As the first car was reversing, a person walked out in front of it to cross the road. Whereupon, the following car scraped its way down the side of the parking car in order to get past rather than waiting and nearly hit the pedestrian. Not only that, but the driver swore at the pedestrian and raced off. This always happens with people in cars. Why is it so important to be 15 feet further along the road that you have to dive in front of a car that is trying to join the traffic. Does it get you home any quicker? Apparently, BBCs Top Gear discovered that if ou let people in front of you at every opportunity, often it takes exactly the same amount of time to get anywhere. How about that eh?  Working in a shop you see this a lot. Especially in my shop which is very narrow and doesn't allow much room for people to get past. People always think they are the most important person in the shop and they can just push past and nobody will notice. I had to throw two people out on Sunday, because one insisted on pushing through (knocking over a display but they ignored that) and the other started to shout at him that she was here first and he should ask to be excused and gave the impression that she  may  move for him. Eventually I had to send them both different ways around the centre.  I have seen a lot more of life than the 19 year olds that I share a flat with and I decided sometime before coming to Univeristy that I didn't care about what happened and I only wanted to worry about things that concerned  me . Assuch I feel so much better and I don't get stressed about anything (apart from the after effects of giving up smoking) The others let all sorts of things bother them and I simply don't care. It makes me laugh.  I don't know if less stress makes you live longer but what you do get is better  Jack
