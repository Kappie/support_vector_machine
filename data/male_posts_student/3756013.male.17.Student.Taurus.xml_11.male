Therefor, all your bitching about how christianity is the only religion that isn't going to burn in hell is very rediculous, because you've got to realize that Christianity is a new idea compared to buddism and hinduism... fuck it, atheism is older then christianity. I can't wait for one of these days to come when you really care for someone, and you try to further your bond with them in whatever way, and you cant because of bigotry and hatred. Do you think you have a bigger cock because you stand in the way of people's happiness? Do you get some sick amusement to make people feel bad? It's bigots like you who give the United States a bad name. Congratufuckinglations on becoming a jackass."   Ok, First of all, whoever posted that comment needs to go back and read what i wrote! Not once did i say that christianity was the only religion not going to hell....In fact, i didnt even mention anybody going to hell...I just stated what i believed as far as the bible and christianity. And as far as this country being founded on christian beliefes...HELLO GENIOUS!!! IT WAS!! Read in every history book...it says it right there. On money it says "In god we trust"...in teh plege..."One Nation Under God"...It mentions god in our constitution! Like I said, I wasnt denouncing other religions or beliefes. Thats what makes this country great, you can worship whatever you like. I have friends who are athiest and the list goes on and on. I have no problem with a person being gay! thats their right, Im just saying what I believe is right, that my faith tells me is right! So if that makes me a jackass I guess i am...I dont know how you got what you did from my last post...but its however you want to translate it. O btw, i have 2 gay friends and a gay aunt that i love to death...but it still doesnt cahnge what i believe. God Bless America
