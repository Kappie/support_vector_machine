Well I was at NC for a week with family and a bunch of people that claimed to be family... anyway had a good time and I think I wil start to update daily but don't take my word on that ;-) Right now I am kinda trying to finish my 6 book reading list for AP english but I am having loads of trouble writing notes.... so if anyone has notes on The Great Gatsby Huck Finn The old man and the sea or Song of Solomen e-mail me. (click on my name).
