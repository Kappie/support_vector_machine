I went to all the memorials with them, then I spilt up and went to the holocaust museum with this British guy I met along the way named Henry. Funny dude.  Except it's hard to be funny in the holocaust museum. You get the idea.  So we went out for food later that night, and I could have had a normal meal. I could have had a burger or even a salad or some soup.  But NO. I'm a jackass. I had to act like a qusdo-intellectual prick and order some ultra spicy raw sushi.  Flash to 5 AM with me over the hotel toilet vomiting my intestine out. I called my dad in, but he's like-  SAM, STFU.    I love my family.   I figure this is all the Jews fault.  If there weren't any Jews to begin with- the Nazis would have picked on some other ethnic group we don't care as much about, and there would be no museum or Henry or bad sushi.  Of course I could  admit  that it was my bad idea to order the food I couldn't pronouce, but blaming the Jewish race seems so much easier right now.   I'm going to go take some more pills and try to get some sleep.
