Just like any normal girl, she went to school and tried to do the best she could at the same time having as much fun as girl can have; close to bursting like an over-filled ballon.  Her dad was a drunk but he meant well and really didn't get involved in the kids activites, she felt alone alot - all of her older siblings had moved away.   Close to her senior year in highschool she met a guy that she thought was so cool.  He was the guy that you couldn't bring home to mother, he was an 'outlaw.'   Of course, she could give two shits less what her mom thought, this guy was hot and he could have some fun.  One night, they both rode up into the yard of her friends house, the engine from the motorcycle making waves of beating sounds across the party goers.  They seemed unphased, their music was bumping and the toxins were pouring a river that babbled alot louder than any harley.  It was just like a scene out of some movie where you ride up to a cliff and there is a bonfire in the distance.  The closer you get the louder the metal \m/ gets, the louder the screams and shouts get.   Two guys on the side porch were smashing beer cans on their foreheads, one fell over the rail and everyone started laughing.  The girl was taken by the care-free attitude of the party-goers, this was everything that she had been feeling, but wasn't sure how to find it.  All smiles and sparkles, she gazed around the scene of totally rebellion and hedonism.  As she walked into the trailer house, three guys and two older women where planted on the couch with smiles on their face, like they just heard the funniest joke in the world.  There it was, the source of their humor, a joint the size of a sharpie marker.  In the back room, serveral girls were passed out on the floor.    "They musta had a little to much to drink.." she smirked.   "Their high on smack, stupid." the boyfriend grinned, acting as if "stupid" was the name of a dear friend. "Have you ever done this shit?" he asked. "Sure, I had my first taste a few summers back." she was shaking with nervousness. He didn't ask anything more of her and they walked outside to check on a few of his other buds. The amazed smile on her awe-stiken face had turned slowly more to a glazed stumble with every beer.  She was talking to another fellow that she had in a class at school, and suddenly she was struck on the left side of her face.  With what, she didn't know, on the ground, she was afraid and sweat started to pour down her face.  She reached to wipe it away, it wasn't sweat but blood.   Another sharp jab was felt in her ribs, the alcohol did little to numb the pain.   After the shock was over, she gathered her self up and began to relaized what was going on, her boyfriend was upset.  She could understand, he arm around the other fella must have looked ill.  The shouting began and he tore away on the motorcycle.  Bruised and beaten, she limped to the trailor house, with the help of some other girls, and taken to the back room to treat her wounds............   ( I will continue the story later)
