I have been to 5 parties in the last 3 weeks, and didn't get drunk at any of them I am pleased to say, probably because I don't want to, but yea. I’m guessing that’s the 4-1-1 for now, but when I get any other things, be sure to stay tuned!  Foot note I’m terribly sorry you’re so beautiful (You know who you are)
