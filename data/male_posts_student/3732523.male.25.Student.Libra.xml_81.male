I therefore would like to dedicate this post to Matt! Yup, finally I no longer have to risk Ginge's bed to spod ;)  I am now settling into life in Dorset quite nicely. It took me only 3 weeks to get a job (and I wasn't really trying that hard the first week, as you do). So yey! I start on Monday so am making the most of my last week of freedom...well not really, I'm sat here at the computer as normal but never mind!  I have to do a three day induction course next week which is sounding worryingly like those dodgy 'managerial courses' they send people on to 'bond' and so forth. I need to take with me three items...which is a bit of a bugger as I didn't bring every bit of crap down south with me! 1. A photo of family or friends (lets see which dodgy meet photo should i pick?) 2. a momento of my best ever holiday (i don't have momentoes other than sand in my suitcase) and 3. an object that helps describe your favourite interest outside of work (sex, drink, err?). So I need to get thinking...  Oh and what the hell are penguin videos doing on our blog? Has Russ infiltrated blogger to add his personal collection?
