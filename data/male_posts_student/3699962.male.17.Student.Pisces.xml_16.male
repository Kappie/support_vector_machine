Whether I've done it well or not is another thing. Guess what? I think I my math paper's done for. And Lit PC? Nonononono... Miss Kon said more than half the papers she already marked have an actual fail... Oww!  AO Chinese oral exams today were aiight. Guess what? I read snow skiing as ice skating in chinese!! Ahh!! A complete giveaway huh. Telling the teachers straight in the face that my chinese SUCKS. Heh. The best part is, those two words came out like. 5 times in the whole passage. Yes, five times. I'm sooooo glad I didn't look up 'cause I'm sure the teachers must have been laughing their bottoms off.  I thought there were a lot of things to do during the exams period. Who knew. More stuff to do now! I need to get a haircut, use this Haagen Daz voucher, shorten my CDs-to-buy list ;), maybe get my hair highlighted, meet up with me Pre-U Sem mateys, do my holiday assignments and I know there's much more, just that I can't remember! :S  I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I might actually miss exam life! Heh. The going-homes before 4, the homework-lessness and the air-conditioned hall! Haha!  P.s. Missing my Pre-U Sem mates heaps... - Amazing what living with people for 6 days can do to you huh.  Sir Germy.
