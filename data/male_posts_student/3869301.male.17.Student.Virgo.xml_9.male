Otherwise I would not see the humor in my life, and the way it plays jokes on me. Like the one where Amanda Dotson and k-ray both enjoy me as a friend but as far as I can tell want me as nothing more when I think it is ovious(sp that Andy or Sam can fix) that I really like them. It is ovious(sp) that they don't feel the same though. Oh well, hopefully the first week of college I will get something. I can go on lagging behind my friend Wheeler in the romance department. I mean, the guy is kind of nuts, but he gets more tail than I have ever had (and he has not gotten that much). I mean I understand Andy getting girls. He fits into a niche market with them. I am not so niche-y though.    Things I hope to have done by the time I update next:  1. Sleep 2. Go with Amanda to get her ears pierced 3. Spend precious time watching a movies with the Wheelers at the cabin   Find out where your niche is, and it will lead to riches. - Hank Hill
