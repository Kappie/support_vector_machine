'he' had extra classes after sch on the FIRST day of term 2.. i can't believe it.. what is wrong with hss.. then the next day, tues.. was openin my front door and all set to go to school when i noticed my dwarf hamster squashed at the corner.. didn't know how Misha escaped and got herself there.. she was already dead of course.. she's a very cute little one.. jus the length of my little finger and yours.. was a little brownish gold.. and very timid.. my bro cleaned up for me.. wasn't a bloody mess.. ed was of course pissed with me cause i woke him up early in the morn jus to clean up.. then he scolded me the f word.. then he asked me to wipe what he has cleared.. i was already late for school.. so i jus went off, leavin him seethin with anger and cursin me more.. whatever it is, thanx for helpin me.. although he's sometimes a pain in the ass.. i was very upset and still am.. but u would never guess what happened in school.. i cried at the parade square.. but pls, it was not filled with ppl.. jus u know.. a grp of ppl here and there and shehana and anita were there for me.. i guess they were very surprised cos it's the first time they have ever seen me cry.. gals, i hope that i didn't scare ya.. lol.. i'm still missin Misha.. kinda guilty also cos didn't really have the time to actually play with her and observe and stuff.. guess she was jus this smalll that she's able to squeeze out of the cage.. still missin her.. i'm also missin him.. dunno how's his studies and stuff.. hope that no gals or whatever is distractin him from what he's doin right now.. hehe.. he got a new hairstyle.. though not very 'in', he's cute.. but i think he shld use the super hard wax.. the gel or wax he's usin right now isn't really gonna last his hair the whole day.. lol.. i noticed that it was kinda 'saggin'.. =) miss him and Misha lots... today, Mr Darren Chong didn't come to school.. because he got rashes and swellings due to sth he ate which contained peanuts.. i dunno what is wrong with this male human being, but as a matter of fact, he's allergic to peanuts.. so weird.. how can a guy be allergic to peanuts.. hmm.. ("-)... so today's happenings weren't much.. same old routine again.. i'm so missin him right now.. he so totally went home at abt 4 plus.. which is kinda late and i'm so pissed.. i dunno why.. anyway, hope that i dun wake up tmr and go to school recountin on what happened to Misha on tues morn again.. and always walkin to school woth a heavy heart.. *sigh*.. me signin off.. =(
