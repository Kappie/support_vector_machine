I'm not going to give up, i need money.  I'm going to the movies - me, adam e a friend of his- we are going to watch "Spider Man 2", It rocks.... at least that's the hope. You'll ont believe in what i'll just tell you guys: my dad gave me 50 bucks couple a days ago. I got in shock, because he never does it, he said "Get it ,and put on your savings" People change!  Yesterday i watched for the third time, "American beauty", what a damn good movie!!!! I love it and i could watch for 10000000 times.
