Today, was our last day in shen yang, so we decided to do a little more shopping. We first went into a huge, rather posh shopping mall. We were looking for a new bag for yuqi. This mall had all the top designer names, but we didn't find one to suit.  After a quick stop on the top floor of the mall for a drink and some ice cream, we walked down under the street into what looked like a subway. In fact, it turned out to be a series of long shopping streets under the ground. Probably the best way to describe it is like loads of market stalls arranged in 2 parallel streets over 2 floors. It really was huge, we browsed around for hours, and must have walked a couple of kilometres. The shops were mostly bright and trendy, selling all kinds of clothes, and plenty more besides. Yuqi and i came away with a mirror for her and cute matching flashing mobile phone straps.  We emerged back into daylight exhausted and hungry. We met da bao's wife, son and yuqi's aunty and uncle who were going to treat us for dinner. We went to a very nice restaurant within walking distance from their flat. We had tofu, noodles, beef and some lovely battered pork with a spicy seasoning.  Finally, it was time to say goodbye. We thanked everyone for all their help and left for the station accompanied by da bao. There was a small miscalculation of the train time, and we boarded the train with only a minute to spare. So, now we're on our way to beijing on another night sleeper service, and we're meeting yuqi's brother and girlfriend when we arrive.  I'm sorry to be leaving shen yang. Both jinbo's and da bao's families have been so generous and helpful. I hope i can repay their kindness.
