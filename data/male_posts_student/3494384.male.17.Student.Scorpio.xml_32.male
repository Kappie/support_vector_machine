Then I just went to some Ole! website created by TP for students to do anything and everything related to our studies. I saw a quiz. I click on it. I am forced to do it.   What the hell!!! IISO Quiz. Review Assessment: AY0405 Sem 1 Quizz 1. I didnt know that once I click on it I need to do it on the spot without exiting the quiz. Cannot stop and resume later. Cannot delay. I've only 20 minutes. I'm forced to complete evereything once. And shit! Those question are so strange. Never seen them before.  But as you people know, I'm that kind of clever person mahz. So I never go lecture, never go tutorial and happily answer 7 out of 10 question correct. Li Hai bahz? Dont jealous lehz people. :P  Hahaz!!!  Maybe just luck bahz. :)  Today lesson till 5. Will go to East Coast today alone. :( But still got to meet up with Kor lorhz. :)  East Coast, here I come... :D  8 more days worz... :D
