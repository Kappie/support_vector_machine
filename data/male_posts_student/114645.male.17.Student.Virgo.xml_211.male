My mom was drinking more than normal, which is okay, because she is about to become the new Managing Broker of Coldwell Banker, which is big news! So after the bar, they went to the baseball game and drank, yet more beer. So I go to leave and I'm driving down Washington and she is like "How fast are you going?" and I said "45" and she said "Um, its 35" and I said "Okay?" Then I get to a light, and slow because it is red, and then it turns green so I accelerate to 45 again, and she said "It is STILL 35!" Then I get home and I just want to sleep because I'm tired, and the bitch has to odasisty to tell me that I am a bad driver and then she goes into this 30 minute speech about me and accidents and shit, and how I have no respect for her and all this bull shit. God I hate my parents. They are so dumb. I wish I was 18 so bad!
