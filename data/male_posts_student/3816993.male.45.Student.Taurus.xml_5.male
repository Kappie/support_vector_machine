(Click  urlLink here  to see full story.)    Admittedly, at first I thought I had made a mistake while reading the headline. Surely, it actuallystated that the Bush administration had   not   invited Reverend Troy Perry (as perhaps previous administrationshad done in the past and hence the newsworthiness of the report). But, after squinting a little closer I discovered that my eyes had read the headline properly.   I tend to have a lot of strong disagreements with President George W. Bush and his administration. However, I also want to, well, give a positive nod when it isdue. I'm not sure if Reverend Perry will accept the offer, and if he does, if the experience will be all that fruitful, but I am at least happy that this offer, this olive-branch (of sorts, I guess???) has been made. Acknowledging the effort, even if some might say it is"too little, too late" is one way to encourage some of the same behaviorin the future. It's my way of trying to encourage a more peaceful interchange with others that view me as their enemy.
