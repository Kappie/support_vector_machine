Many have asked me since I moved to the US about Canada's relationship to the Queen.  So here it is, in a nutshell.  Canada is a member country of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Queen is presently our Head of State.  However, over the past century and a half, Canada has grown in its independence from Britain with several notable events, the most important of which was the birth of the Canadian Federation in 1867.  In 115 years, Canada would get its own flag, national anthem, and eventually, full control of its government...   The fundamental text of the Canadian Constitution was the British North America (BNA) Act, 1867, by which the Canadian federation was established, uniting what were then British colonies. The Act was a statute of the United Kingdom Parliament, and as such could only be changed in London. After Confederation Canada gradually assumed more autonomy over its own affairs until its independent status (and that of the other self-governing dominions) was recognized in the Balfour Report of 1926. Beginning in 1927, discussions were held about patriating Canada's Constitution -- transferring amending authority from the British Parliament to Canada - but governments couldn't agree on constitutional amending procedures. Consequently, when Canada officially ceased to be a British colony with passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, authority to amend the Constitution remained with the British Parliament. In 1949 the Canadian Parliament was given a limited amending power in areas that did not concern provincial jurisdiction. Despite many discussions and several formal conferences, agreement on a comprehensive set of amending procedures proved elusive for more than 30 years.  Enter: Pierre Elliot Trudeau.  With Quebec under Renee Levesque resisting at every turn, Trudeau took matters into his own hands and organized the repatriation of the Canadian constitution.  The objections of Quebec have nothing to do with any great desire of theirs to remain subject to the British Parliament, but to the intense hatred of the Quebecois for Trudeau, who they saw as a traitor.   I mention the repatriation of the Constitution because there are still many members of the British Commonwealth who have not done this, and so this distinguishes Canada.  So after 1982, Canada's dependence on Britain and her Majesty has been minimal.  Practically speaking, the British Parliament has no influence in Canada's affairs.  But Canada does rely on the Queen for various ceremonial activities.  Most importantly, the Queen issues a "Speech from the Throne" which opens Parliament each year.  Actually, the Governor General (presently Adrienne Clarkson) writes the speech and reads it in the Senate Chamber.  But it is an act of the Queen and requires her consent.  Secondly, all honours issued in Canada, like the Order of Canada, flow from the fountain who is the Queen.  Aside from those things, she opened the Montreal Olympics and made a few visits here and there.  So there you are.  There  is  a Queen of Canada, much to my surprise.  Sorry for the false information that I have been giving all this time.   But if I were at a dinner party with the Queen and the Prime Minister, I'd toast the PM first.  Heck, if I were at a dinner party with the Queen and the President of the Windsor Lawn Bowling Association, I'd toast the latter and maybe then give a head nod to Liz.
