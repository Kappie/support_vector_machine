In my room the temp is 24.5 degrees C (my clock has a digital thermometre (sp?) on it ;-) )  I'm gonna go outside in a bit and have a little kick about.  Since my last entry, I haven't done anything special. I went on one more jog, and then lost heart. I can't find it in me to continue the jogging - I'll try and go tomorrow morning, we'll see what happens.  My broadband is working finally - not sure if I wrote that in my first entry - I might have, but it don't matter. Its so damn fast, I've downloaded loads of videos since it was up (not  those sort of videos!!!)  Tomorrow, I'm going to revise a SOLID 5 hours for my Maths exam (mechanics module) that I have on friday. The subject is so hard, and I don't even properly understand it. So 5 hours a day, for 4 straight days = 20 hours, I should grasp it by then.  Im off - going to play football.  Bye!  Currently Listening 2: Michael Jackson - Smooth Criminal  PS: I will update the blog on a daily basis from now on, hopefully.
