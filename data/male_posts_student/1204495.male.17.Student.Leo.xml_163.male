I smile at random people all the time, I get scowls back.. or sometimes a smile.. the scowls suck, and you gotta pick carefully who you smile at.. some people think that you're laughing at them and they want to start an argument. Anypoo..  If I look at the world, it means I'll look at life and the whole.. "what's the point".. and frankly I'll come up with nothing. All we're here for is to maybe make somebody else happy. Even that's fleeting.. meh oh well =) I liked reading your entries, hehe.
