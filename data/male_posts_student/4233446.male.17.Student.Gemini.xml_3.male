Anyway....two girls in my study hall got caught yesterday snorting coke...10 FUCKING FEET AWAY FROM THE TEACHER! Come on...how FUCKING STUPID do you have to be to do that. Jesus fucking Christ...grow some fuckin brains. And the kicker...one of them only got a one day suspension. Ummm...anyone else see the idiocy in that? Doing drugs...in school...suspended one day. WTF?!? The other's in jail...but she had 6 or 7 grams of coke and 3 grams of weed. Fuckin idiots.  And on to other things....  Someone who I've become really close to is having a really difficult time right now and there's not a fuckin thing I can do about it.  Meredith if you read this know that if I could take your pain away, I would do so in a heartbeat.  I wish so bad that I could be there for you.  But, seeing as how I'm not, I'll do my best to try and comfort you whenever you're in need of it.  I'll always be there for ya.  Well...there's some more stuff on my mind...but I don't really feel like posting any of it on here.  So, that concludes today's entry.  Peace
