Seems like my belief that I am a fast learner is finally broken...Sob sob. There were times when I really felt like breaking the CPU to vent my frustration.  Browsing through computer books and talking to friends trained in IT brought me more confusion such as XML, CSS and JAVA. Add to that the incessant throbbing pain of my toothache,which no amount of painkillers seem to help, and you get the perfect concoction to drive anyone bonkers.  All these had resulted in little sleep during the night and had caused me to be unable to even walk properly in the morning cos I nearly bumped into a girl(quite nice-looking though) when I was walking back home in a daze. I am not trying to discourage anyone to attempt HTML but don't do it overboard. However, all these obstacles did not dampen my spirits but it had further fuelled my desire to make my site a PERFECT one. It had been years since I felt such pure adrenaline flow in my blood and I am not going to miss out on this experience, even at the expense of other things!
