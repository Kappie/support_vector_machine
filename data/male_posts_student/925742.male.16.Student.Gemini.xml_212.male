Apparently he was drinking and was wondering if he was too drunk to drive home (from a friends place, where the party was at).  So he assumed a leg balancing kung fu position.  All of the sudden,  "HEY KARATE KID, YOU PUSSY"  And Derek turned to me like he did a week ago at the party and said, "What, what was that?"  "Does that karate get you girls?" "Its kung fu, asshole, and she's with me. *points*"  Suddenly, he explains, he was sucker punched by one of a circle of five assholes.  Ok, are you with me here?  This is probably one of his ascensions from basic kung fu abilities to more advanced fighting.  Shenmue style 5 on 1 brawling.   He is hit 4 times in the face and head in ten seconds and all he can do is defend himself and do horse kicks (I've been horsed by Derek when we were sparring.  He kicked both my legs and I couldn't fucking stand).  Then , a punch comes in and he fucking grabs it.  Being drunk(ish) as he was, he never expected that to happen.    "He's FAST!"  The puncher was actually amazed.  Then another guy just sucker punches him again on his left eye.  Soon, after he continues to dodge multiple blows (he only got hit EIGHT TIMES IN THE HEAD) he is told to leave.  Being smart as he is, he complies.  Now he's walking into the street when the guys talk cool to him and he turns to face them, thinking its all over, they want to make peace.    The chode fucking punches him in the mouth, splitting his lip.    Derek eventually goes home, barely in pain (except for the headache from the drinking/blows to the head).  So, the parts I didn't describe here you can imagine he was Ryo Hazuki in Shenmue and was doing miscellaneous moves to defend from 5 other goons like in the game.  I really admire my bro.
