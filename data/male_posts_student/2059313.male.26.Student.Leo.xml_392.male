Now, I've worked there for four years, now, and each time I've left, I have just had a friend or two say goodbye to or to "see me off".  Tonight people are actually getting together to have kind of a send off get-together for me.  Never has anyone ever done that for me, and it just really makes me feel like part of a really awesome family.  I'm really going to miss a lot of the people from my church, and especially people from my small group.  I suppose I've gotten by before, but I'm just a little bit sader to leave this year, even though I know I'll have a good time in Prestonsburg.  On another note, Blogger just launched it's new site and they've got a blue zillion new templates, so I figured I'd try one out.  They've also got a whole slew of new features to try out.  Too bad I won't have a lot of time to actually play around with them before I leave.  Oh well.  Thanks to all my friends and "family" for your presence in my life.
