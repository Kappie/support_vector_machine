I hope my loyal fans (yes, I mean all two of you) recall when  urlLink FOX News threatened to sue the Simpsons  over a segment parodying their rightward bias. I'd be pleased if my loyal fans remembered when the  urlLink RIAA threatened to sue Ed Felten  for publishing his success at their watermark-breaking challenge. I'd be surprised if my loyal fans recall when my friend Tom Lotze was  urlLink threatened with a copyright lawsuit  over his mirroring of the  urlLink hamster dance , a webpage of animated gifs and 30 seconds of music (the ones on the first link) taken from the Disney animated film Robin Hood (by its creator, not Disney).  Now the Simpsons got very lucky: the corporation suing them happened to be a fellow subsidiary of a larger company, so they just pointed this out and walked away with a stern warning never to do anything like it again. Ed Felten got less lucky: he got to publish his paper, but he actually had to file a lawsuit to get that far (in which, by the way, the respondents claimed they'd never threatened a lawsuit). If either hadn't been lucky, the smart move for each would have been to let themselves be bullied. And while I've admittedly just cherry-picked the first examples I remembered, these cases are far from the only ones where people who were clearly in the right almost backed down because of the threat of legal trouble.  Things are worse because of the internet; what if the FOX News parody segment had been on homestarrunner.com, or this website? Individuals have tended to let their rights be trampled by big corporations with lawyers who send them threatening letters, and the reason is clear: properly defending a even a frivolous lawsuit by a rich entity is a huge cost in time and money. Even if the case is immediately dismissed, it probably costs thousands of dollars to get that far. This happens because going to court is a prisoner's dilemma-type situation even in the best of cases: if either party decides not to settle, that means huge sunk costs for both, making it often infeasible for a smaller party to be sued by a larger one. That leads us to the situation we have now: corporations with plenty of resources, in-house lawyers, and so on, send letters threatening lawsuits against individuals doing things they don't like even if those things are almost certainly not grounds for a suit, and the individuals back down because they can't afford the cost of fighting.  How do we negate, or at least blunt, this power? I have two thoughts. First is making it easier to seek large damages in court for legal extortion of this kind; if someone threatens a frivolous lawsuit, the threatened individual can seek compensation in court. While some version of this might be the right way to go, it suffers from two obvious problems. First, in order to be substantially deterrent, the amount of damages would need to be set fairly high for even sending a threatening letter (how much money to deter Disney?), which seems way out of proportion. Second, the whole regime seems ripe for abuse by unscrupulous lawyers, which is never a good way to set out on new policy.  My second suggestion, which I had just today, seemed better: since current charitable free legal services aren't stopping the problem, why not have public defenders for civil suits? Simply have the court provide the defendant with an attorney if they need one and cover legal costs. If the cost is excessive, you could restrict the program to cases in which the plaintiff's net worth exceeds that of the defendent by (several?) orders of magnitude or cut off the support after some amount of work had been done. I admit readily that I've yet to estimate the costs on this one (I don't know how much public defenders make), but I wonder if it might not take a large bite out of the problem; when Fox comes knocking on the humorist's door, the humorist has a free lawyer to go into court and say "it's a parody, idiot" and the suit goes away. In fact, it probably never got filed in the first place.  I'm sure there are a few obvious minor holes. But why would this not be a good idea in general?  PS: The last tale is less clear-cut than the others; I intend it to bring home the point that threats of hard-to-defend lawsuits are neither far away nor abstract, but rather can happen to you or people you know.
