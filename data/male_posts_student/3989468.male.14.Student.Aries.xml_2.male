Here goes:      ü Life's full of CROSSROADS... And Fate ISN'T FIXED... It depends on the CHOICES we make when we meet these crossroads and... Life's STILL FULL of Crossroads... So don't miss "The Opportunity" once it knocks... ü   It might sound kinda corny with some people but the truth is... There's a really good meaning to it. And if you have a friendster account by the way, ADD ME UPplease!!!     Here's my email address: kensapalo@yahoo.com
