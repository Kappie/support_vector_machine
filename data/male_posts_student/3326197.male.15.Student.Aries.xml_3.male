Gah... dad was on the computer last night for ages and I couldn't go on! I had to spend hours lying on my bed listening to radio, and when they played a crap song, I turned the foxtel digital music channels on, and when they all went crap, I had to play my cd's, and I remembered I left my Evanescence cd in the jukebox in the front room! Ridiculous! Gah! But it's cool, I played Jet for a while, then I think I fell asleep... Teehee my nose is blocked. I love blogging. *Yawn* God i'm tired. Today i'll prolly study a bit for the exams coming up and go on my forum and watch Charmed... Yeah... I like saturday. :D Here's my friend Mel's Blog -  urlLink Click here!  , she's kewl, she's gonna do Photography like me next year! I'm cold, shivering! Meh!
