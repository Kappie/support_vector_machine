When did I get myself banned fro undernet? Strange. By the way I mucked up my windows xp installation with Sun Solaris (x86 version) so i'm working with an oldwer IBM T23 laptop... :-/. I tryed to fix it but repair didn't work so I reinstalled. My network card didn't work (it is a new gigabit card.) and of corce you cant just DOWNLOAD THE DRIVERS IF YOU HAVE NO NETWORKING so I had to burn it onto a cd. Durring my installation there was a few problems copying a few dlls like for the MMC and stuff so I tried installing XP SP 1 but oddly it didn't get updated.. waahhh. To bad I dont have one of those niiiiice powerbooks or ibooks with firewire because I could just do a little internet connection sharing.. who would need a gigabit card! uhgy!  I want a mac. - Jeff
