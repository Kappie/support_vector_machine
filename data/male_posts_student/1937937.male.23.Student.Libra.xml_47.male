She's almost done, but until sometime in early June, she retains the title of "senior".  Then, she graduates, and if all goes well, she goes off and becomes a "freshman" again at some university somewhere.  I don't know if she's going to do that.  Cece amazes me because she lets me see what it's like to go to public school in Miami.  She's a smart girl.  She gets by in school.  But the thing is, she doesn't have to  do  anything.  This blows my mind!  It doesn't even seem that she needs to be there in order to graduate!  How does this work?  If I remember correctly, I had something like 89 absences my senior year, but I couldn't just get away with it: I came very close to not graduating, and was only able to get out by pulling strings with the administration.  The public school system in Miami-Dade county is atrocious.  I mean, it's the worst.  Florida alone isn't so great: for example, in 2002, we ranked 41st out of the 50 states for instructional staff per 10,000 capita  urlLink [NEA Rankings] .  The average salary of a Florida public school teacher in the 2000-01 school year was $38,230 -- that's 29th in the nation, with the national average $43,400 [see above].  So, as a state, we're paying our teachers $5,170 less than the national average.  The best teacher's salaries: Connecticut ($52,693), California ($52,480), New Jersey ($52,268), and New York ($51,500).  So when you've got an excellent teacher making the choice between moving to Connecticut or Florida, they're going to see 15,280 reasons why they should pick Connecticut.  So you may be asking yourself: what does this have to do with Cece?  Well, I've got to clean the bathtub, so I'll let you figure it out...
