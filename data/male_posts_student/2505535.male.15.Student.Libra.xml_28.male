And I also had a jamming session, even though there was a lead crisis we managed to get everything together and it all went smoothly, we were loud and funky (plus in tune and in time) Alan offered to fix one of my leads, which was really cool of him. Everyone played really well, fun fun fun.  I have a large range of movies I could watch tonight, my sister got a few DVDs for her birthday, and my mum found a whole load of cheap 2nd hand DVDs when she was shopping, which includes all the batman films! *gasps*
