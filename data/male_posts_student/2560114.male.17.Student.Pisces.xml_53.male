I only completed the beggining part of it, so i need to come on another day and also i needed more ppl to help out. Nick came to help and i appreciated that, it shows me how much he would help and teammate and a friend. Also dan helpin out was key cuz i wouldnt b doin this without him, haha. Hhanywayz, the first part of the video i had to make a little intro to tell where the coaches where im from and stuff and what im gonna b demonstratin in the video. Then i had to do the passing part of the video, first it was serve recieve and free ball passin, i did pretty damn good. Then i had to do digging, i had like 3 overpasses...BLAH!...i was hella tired cuz it was like a 3 minute coach-on-one. Then i had to pass and get outside to hit, which was alright except for like 2 passes. Finally i had to get to the hitting part of the video, i only did the beggining part which was pass the ball and then get outside to hit. I hit the ball pretty well, but it could of been a lot better. So maybe next time when im gonna finish the video, i might have to do some of the drills over and finish hitting and get servin and blockin out of the way. So yea...that was my day so far...now to do some freakin garcia hw...stupid...lata.   urlLink Superman(Its Not Easy)
