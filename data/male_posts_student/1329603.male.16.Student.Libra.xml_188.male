I just feel small, annoying, and somewhat insignificant... I guess most people get that from what they tell me. But, you know, it's not entirely enjoyable. But never mind. Actually, don't comment on this one. I don't want a load of a people saying "I don't find you annoying" because that won't really help. Whether you find me annoying or not is marginally irrelavant - I feel it.  Love, Jon Roskilly
