Which was good because I liked the food. It was yummy. Then I got dropped off at home while the rest of my family went to Wal-mart because I didn't feel like going. Then I went to Harry Potter 3. Those Harry Potter movies get more and more bizarre every time. This one, they had a bird-horse, a rat that turns into be the killer of Potter's parents. Ouch, I'm mean, pretend you didn't hear that :-) But I told you not to read this. So that's your problem. But it was one bizarre movie. But it was actually okay. Then I came home, and I burned a CD for my KLT. And now I'm really tired. So after I'm done talking to Mary. I'm going to bed. Oh yeah! Andrew and Brian come home tomorrow. Which is awesome. And Haley is leaving tomorrow for her mission trip, so pray for her! Well I'm gonna go. Later!
