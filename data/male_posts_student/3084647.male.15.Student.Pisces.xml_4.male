There it functioned happily for almost 200 years, being one of the few wizarding schools in the world. No matter. 	 In 1819, Sir Stamford Raffles of the East India Company discovered a tiny isle on the tip of the Malayan peninsula. This island soon came to be known as Singapore. Sir Raffles did much for the development of Singapore – changing it from a sleepy, rural island to a bustling trade centre. He set up many schools for the population, and many children benefited from his initiative.          Not many people know, however, that Sir Raffles was in fact a wizard.  	 He had attended Hogwarts when young, and had emerged a fresh-faced graduate with a N.E.W.T in Muggle Studies. As thus he joined the East India Trading Company, planning to carry out the admirable mission of setting up schools for wizards and witches wherever he went. 	 And so, in a remote corner of Singapore, he created a school with the help of a few fellow wizards (one of the most notable was of course, William Farquhar). Having no knowledge of Singaporean names or customs, he named the school Hogwarts, after its British counterpart. He was careful enough, however, to add “Singapore branch” beside the name.  	 He too mimicked the tradition of Sorting students and having Houses. However, having a rather (notoriously) poor memory, he misnamed the four Houses Griffindoor, Huffelpuff, Ravingclaw and Slithering. His colleagues, being too exasperated to correct him, let the names be. And so Hogwarts – Singapore Branch – was set up.   A hundred and eighty-five years on…
