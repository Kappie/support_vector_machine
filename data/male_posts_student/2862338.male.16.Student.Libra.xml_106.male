(yes), ok then...  lol, my vacation is way to filled with detials to describe to you.  Sure, i have stories,  but nothing thats gonna keep you on the edge of your seats.  I'm going to spare myself the agonizing task of acutally typing it all out, so if any of you want to know how it went, your going to have to ask me. Sorry!! juss my attitude right now.  But i will start from the day i got back....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, back.....(??)  lol, i come home and call jorge to see wahts going on, he's with Hernie and Michelle, and they trying to see what they can do.  During htat time, Jorge mentions Jones is gone, and left us the house, and that mike and Benny are over there.  So i think about it, and SHIT! i got's to go to jones'! lol, we juss pretty much chill the whole night (czank was there too by the way), stay up till 5 and shit, and wake up pretty early the next day. We planned that we where gonna have a BBQ, and a buncha people were gonna show up.  Well, that same night, i talk to Caroline, telling her of the plan, and my intent on Suprising Lilia.  lol, turns out, it worked out perfectly! UNFORTUNATLY though, we were locked out for some time, due to ben and Mike going to their houses. Totally fine though, i got to catch up with the girls (caroline, Farah, and Lilia). Anyway, we eventually get back in, and slowly but surely, more and more people show up.  At it's climax, there was about 10 people there: Lilia, Farah, Caroline, Inna, me, rob, Czank, Rick, Mike, and of course, Benny P.  Saying that, i have to admit we meshed pretty good.  I thought it was going to be more "wierd", but it turned out to be just fine.  Caroline had a previous arrangement to go somewhere, so she left.  and slowly but surely, rob left too (after kareoke revolution, and the eye toy, in which we had ALOT of fun..), leaving the rest of us watching Finding Nemo.  And i have to say, good movie, but i enjoyed where i was sitting better :o) (sorry!!! u had to be there...and nope, i ain't saying a WORD!) All i can say is that i'm really falling for lilia right now, and everytime i'm with her, it's better than the last. anyway, after the movie, czank dropped off the girls for me, and we went back home, which is when i fell asleep, but nope beofre waking up to close my windows due to the flash rain that decided to start.  Good night though. I wake up this morning pretty late, come back home, take a shower, eat, type this out, and here i am...  i've had my contacts on for 4 days streight  i watched finding nemo  Freinds house for a week  Surrounded by great freinds  with a even greater girlfreind  and juss came back from Vacation  can it get even greater? i hope so... :o)
