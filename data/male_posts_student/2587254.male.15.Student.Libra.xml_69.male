Crazy how the dude still seems to remember us so well hahaha. Well yeah it was cool to see a whole entry.......FOR OUR FELLOWSHIP!? Were we actually that annoying though back then I wonder? Wouldn't be surprised.....but yeah I never really realized how much more mature we've got over the years. Come to think of it....we've changed......A LOT. But it's pretty cool that he still remembers us hehehe. Gavin still learns guitar off him so yeah I guess he'd remember Gavin pretty well hehe. Well yeah thought I'd add that....pretty cool though seein' that we're still in his mind. Keep growin' in Christ Jesse.....if it were never for you LCAC would probably still have no youth fellowship.  Well I'm gone hehe....lates people.
