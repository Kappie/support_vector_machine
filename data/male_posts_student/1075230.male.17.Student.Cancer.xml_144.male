I met up with a lot of old friends, and found things are not what they used to be (stupid of me to think that it might - too much changes in one year). lol, I remember attaching myself to Keane for the first two months of school... and getting lost very often. Then there was confusion about tests and test centre, units and unit submission, day zeros (I spent my first Day 0 hallwalking because I had no idea what to do), and Focus (which I joined without taking the test - keane dragged me to see Mr.Church, the then-Focus teacher). I eventually met and got to know Joe and Hoshi throughout the year - among a bunch of other friends.   By the time I got adjusted to everything, I was quite behind in units. *sigh* I remember saying to myself that I won't fall behind to start with... but I did. And it got worse. On the bright side, I joined CSUNA for the 3 rd  year in a row, and actually got up and spoke some stuff. Best year ever... I plan to join next year. (CSUNA = model UN). Also, I joined the Anime Society, and was kinda... taken aback... at how late it ended ^^;; We watched Cowboy Bebop the movie - personally, I feel that Cowboy Bebop's plot and stuff goes too slowly... I heard that usually they start off with Akira. Glad they didn't, as I already saw that (and was left very, very confused).   Hope I haven't bore you all t'death yet ^^;;   ~Chronos
