Gina hasnt been on either and i havent been able to get a hold of her to find out if she likes me or not. I still have 26 days of summer, which is good and bad. But im accually looking foward to take my ag classes that i wanna take so i cant wait for school to start. And all the stupid senors are going to be off my bus, unless they didnt graduate. More room on the bus for me! Well anyway it getting really old and i really havent been hangin out with my friends this summer like usuall i dunno why. I guess the one that lives closest to me, David, is still playin his video games all day. After we went camping with him and my mom and dad, Ive noticed hes soooo picky. One time we were hungry and my mom was sleepin so i decide to make him and me a hamburger on the grill, and i toasted his bun. Really bad mistake. He said that it tasted like "stove" and so i told him to cook for himself cause im not making him anything else to eat. So then he woke up my mom, which was pissed. But he used to sleep over like every weekend but now barely ever. Well i could care less hes really starting to get annoying. Well im also looking foward to next weekend cause im going camping again!! This time with my sis and her bf, my mom, dad, and me!! It will be soooooo fun, I hope. Well thats it for today. Till tomorrow.....
