It not only lit up the screen, but it brought my imagination above and beyond it's farthest limits.   First thing I did after I saw it, was build myself a awesome boat, sewed myself a leather pirate hat, and went-a-sailin'... ARrrrrr!  Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was the most beautiful proformance ever.  Everthing about it was unforgettable.  I give it seven gold coins out of seven gold coins!!!!  (I like the number seven.)  __________________________________________________________________  0000000 out of 0000000
