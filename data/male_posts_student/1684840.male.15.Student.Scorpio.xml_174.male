Yes, today I have taken drugs, one which is widely available and almost everyone takes - literally.  This was before walking around mind...  What?!  I'm not on weed or anything like that... whatever gave you that idea!  I'm talking about  trimethylxanthine , that's caffeine to you kids.  It is the most popular drug on the planet and people take it without even knowing it.  So in the form of a post, I shall rant and rave about caffeine and give you some interesting coffee facts     Caffeine is the world's most popular drug! First isolated from coffee in 1820! Caffeine is derived from the Arabic word qahweh! Caffeine is also found in tea! Reaches all tissues of the body within five minutes! Slightly increases water loss through urination... *cough* Caffeine drives me flippin mad I haven't had it for ages and it smells     Moooving on... We had an okay time, as I said my brain feels a bit funny because we were going around and around on a round-a-bout and frankly that was a bit stupid!
