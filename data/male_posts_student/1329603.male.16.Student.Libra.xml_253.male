Mostly, because I was hanging around with about 7 women and Dave Smith, who interjected with things like "I can imagine you as a mother... picking up an axe and hitting your kids with it going "NO, I WILL NOT MAKE YOU ANY MORE PANCAKES!"... course by 'you' he didn't mean me, he meant the person who'd been talking about how she would be a good mother *shrugs*.  Anyway, went into Pates today at lunch, which ruled... seriously, it did. Saw Laura and Fi, got hugged a bit by both, which ruled, talked a bit to Laura, which ruled, saw Nikki briefly which was nice but not enough to see someone like Nikki for! Everyone was really nice, including Becca (tall Belgium woman who is cool and I love), and seemed generally pleased that I was there, all apart from Rebs who turned round and said "What the hell are YOU doing here?". Aw, no, she meant it nicely, I'm sure. Also saw Shez, and Will/Matt, John, Celia, a couple of women I hadn't met before, and the old oboe player for CAYO, as well as Zoe and Lisa briefly. Really cool day seeing some of the greatest people in the world all at once. Especially seeing as I don't see them a lot. Laura, Fi, Nikki, Zoe, Lisa, Shez, John, Will/Matt, Rebs, Jo, Nick, Segye, Celia and Becca, you all rule and I love you. Come back!  Had a practice with Aural for the gig on Sat, as well, and that was fun... yeah, was cool to play with them all again... *sniffs*  Have fun at King Lear, you lot.  ...  Jazz and Scott and everyone, you all rule too, but I didn't see you today >_  Quote of the day: "The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, Though to itself it only live and die, But if that flower with base infection meet, The basest weed outbraves its dignity: For sweetest things turned sourest by their deeds; Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds."  From Shakespeare's   Sonnet XCIV   Love, Jon Roskilly
