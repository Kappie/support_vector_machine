I made a lot of new friends; including Areku, both Catherines, Anthony, Mika, Lindsay, and Joel. I also decided to stop acknowledging stereotypes and social "rules". For example, I got over that really immature thing umong students at my school where you can't listen to punk or pop or 80's music or else you're a loser or a fag. I now refuse to not listen to good music just because it's not "cool". I think Britney and Avril have a lot of talent. What else.... I'm more about myself around people. I decided that all those people that hate me because they're jealous already think I'm a fag, so why not confirm their suspiscions? Ha! I think I'm more of a fun person now and I'm no longer afraid of social situations.  My classes were: Monday/Friday: Science, 30 min advocacy, English, math, health/PE, 30min lunchSpanish, Art. Tuesday: Science, 10 min advocacy, English, math, 60min lunch, health/PE. Wednesday: Science, 10 min advocacy, English, Spanish, 60min lunch, art. Thursday: Math, 10 min advocacy, health/PE, Spanish, 60min lunch, art.  They were OK. I had one of the best science teachers ever first semester. She really made me interested in the lessons and helped me get a high grade. She left so she could live with her husband down on the Columbia River. Her replacement for the rest of the year was a man who did not go to any education schooling and did not have a teaching liscense. He was a crappy teacher and didn't give a damn about anything. He'd give us tests without letting us learn the chapters. I tried really hard and did all of the assignments and papers and I think he gave me a C+ because he didn't like the fact that I didn't look him in the eyes. He told me this upset him several times. I can't help it, I just can't take him seriously. He didn't come to work on Fridays. Our exam day was a Friday. The substitute agreed that the test was unreasonable and extreme and let us use our text books.  Advocacy was stupid, except for when we had student forums where we got to give our opinions on the student climate. I got really into it and was elected president because of my goals to boost morale and have more creative ideas for fundraisers and events. That should be fun.  My English teacher was nice. She was reasonable with the work she gave us and gave us fun projects to do. She also really liked my work and gave me high grades. One time she did make us read a book that I hated. She was really concerned because I wasn't doing very well on those test (I never read the chapters) and kept giving me weird glances. Other than that, I didn't have a problem with her because she was really sweet and had this great learning system. She believed that after 14 minutes of talking to us about a subject our minds "downshift" and she must switch to a different topic to keep us focused. It worked.  My math teacher was interesting. I guess I liked him. He didn't really have a personality. The whole year was just do our homework, review the homework, do more homework. Test. Repeat. He was cool.  I hate my health/PE teacher. She made us run in PE! (I know, *gasp*)... I guess I improved because before that PE class I couldn't run for 15 minutes without stopping but now I can. I also lost weight. But thank goodness I'm not taking a PE class next year!  My Spanish teacher was great. He really made me interested in the Spanish language (even though I think it's a really ugly language). I picked it up really well and I got more than 100% in the class, when the class average was a C-. I really liked it and I'm glad I have him again next year. He was really good because he let us work independantly a lot of the time and showed us movies in Spanish. We watched Stand and Deliver, Shrek, Sweet 15, Bend it like Beckham, Finding Nemo, Ice Age, and The Milagro Beanfield Miracle.  I guess it was a pretty good year. I really like the town I moved to because the people are really friendly and it's really clean and beautiful. My GPA for the year was probably only about a 3.5 average. That's pretty good, but 2-3 points less than last year. That's OK. I think I learned more this year.  I had 3 or 4 boyfriends this year. My personal record. I think I have also fallen in love. A couple other times I thought I had but now I don't think I really did. Now I just get this feeling everytime I see or even think about this person that makes me feel like I'm nothing without him and I'd do anything to just touch him. Sometimes just the thought of him makes me start to cry. Oh yeah, I've matured!  I now officially leave for the UK  TOMORROW !  *sigh*, love for all...
