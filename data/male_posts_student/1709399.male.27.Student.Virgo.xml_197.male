Derek O'Brien was at his witty,naughty best . We missed out on some pretty easily guessable questions. However , I got an audience question right and managed to come home with some gift vouchers as a consolation. For my partner Vijai it turned out to be a much enjoyable evening. For him it was a mini IIM-L 2003 Alumni meet since he met most of his batchmates there  had fun.                                                  Publicis (The ad Co) won the delhi round and did some very intelligent answering in the last rounds.
