NOW. it is that good.   i came back from erik's game today. we did alright, won 13-7. erik didn't play much but he had a nice pulling tackle on some guy. stevie reyes on the other hand...erm, well, we should've lost because kennedy was better, but they had a couple of interceptions, a fumble, and a holding call that nullified a go-ahead touchdown. how sad. fun time, it was cold and alex froze to death in his shirt. me with my ipod that can hold only 2 songs!...2 five-gigabyte songs...the second song gets really good at the 1,250th minute. then natasha and sindy tried to get their binders but some custodian bitch told us to leave. asshole.  umm tomorrow tee-fah-nee's party for about 2 hours, and then open gym. finally! after all these years...
