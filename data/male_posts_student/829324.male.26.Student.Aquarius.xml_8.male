The general impression derived from the Homeric poems suggests nothing of the kind.  The inner and outer tensions are skilfully implied, but the total portrait is that of a man well integrated both in his own temperament and with his environment.  As Athene emphasized, he was essentially "self-possessed," fully able to control conflicting passions and motives.  His psychological tensions never reach a breaking point.  They serve rather to give him his dynamic force.  As a result his purposefulness is like an arrow shot from a well-strung bow, and his energy has the tirelessness of coiled springs.  Resilience, elasticity, concentration, these are the qualities that maintain his temperamental balance.  In contrast the Ajax-like hero was superficially firm and strong.  His code of conduct and his heroic pride encased his heart like archaic armor.  Once this psychological carapace was pierced by some violent shock the inner parts were as soft as any crustacean's.  Odysseus' strength and self-possession did not depend on any outer armor.  He could be as firm and enduring in the role of a beggar or in the cave of a Cyclops as in full battle-dress at Troy.  This was the quality that the Cynic and Stoic philosophers were most to admire later.  Such was his inner harmony and strength.  His conduct in matters of major importance shows a similar purposeful integrity.  He had a remarkable power of taking the long view, of seeing actions in their widest context, of disciplining himself to the main purpose in hand.  Thus while other heroes at Troy are squabbling like children over questions of honor and precedence, Odysseus presses on steadily towards victory.  And why?  Not, Homer implies, for the sake of triumph and plunder, but in order to return to his beloved Ithaca as soon as possible.  Here Odysseus' efforts for the Greek cause are integrated with his fundamental love of home;   pro bono publico  is ultimately  pro domo sua .  Similarly his loyalty to the Companions during the fabulous voyages, and his patience with their infuriating alternations of rashness and timidity, were part of the same enlightened egotism:  he needed a crew to sail his ship home.  His love for Penelope, too, was, as has been suggested already, not based entirely on  eros  or  agape , but also contained that  philia , that attachment to one's normal and natural social environment which underlies so much of Greek happiness.  And his piety is the piety of one who wishes to keep on good terms with the gods.  Such mixed motives may seem impure or ignoble to those who take their ideals from self-sacrificing patriotism, or from self-effacing saintliness, or from self-forgetting romanticism.  But these are post-Homeric concepts.  Within the context of the Heroic Age and perhaps of the Homeric Age, too, this identification of one's own best interests with the general welfare of one's kith, kin, and comrades, with one's  philoi  in fact, was a saving grace for both the individual and society.  All the Homeric heroes are egotists;  but Odysseus' egotism has sent its roots out more widely into his personal environment than that of Agamemnon, Achilles, or Ajax."
