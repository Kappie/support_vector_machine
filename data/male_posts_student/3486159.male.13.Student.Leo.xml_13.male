'How was  "El Retardo Spidero"  retarded?' you may ask... Well, here is the story... So I was brushing my teeth, and  "El Retardo Spidero"  was in the sink trying to climb out of it. Anyway, every time  "El Retardo Spidero"  got to a really high point in the sink, trying to get out... He slipped and fell back down. So I watched him for a couple of minutes, laughing constantly... Finally, I felt bad for  "El Retardo Spidero" , so I got a Q-Tip and he climbed on it and I released him right by the sink... Anyway,  "El Retardo Spidero"  clearly did not want to leave his fun time at my sink, so he literally  JUMPS  back into the sink, repeating the process again...  I wonder if he's still there.  Yeah, still there.
