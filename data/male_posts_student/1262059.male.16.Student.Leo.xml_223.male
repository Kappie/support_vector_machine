Only because it won't appear on LJ =P Anyway, i was going over my post, and just wanted to add a few things. First off, happy belated bday to my mom (all i did was say "happy bday" and even that was near the end of the day --;; i almost forgot...). Secondly, keane would also make a good addition to an online newspaper crew ^^ Next, saw Chat and Eugenie on the libz site... oh, and i believe Eugenie helps out with that award-winning online newspaper.    S'all for now... *left wondering if anyone comes here anymore*    Double Addendum   http://www.earlhaig.com/carpanatomy/  http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/jarvisci/jargonline/main.html   I'd say  those  ones are much harder to beat... maybe when Toronto Star was evaluating, they took into account that public schools have like 4 times the human and technological resources that catholic schools do.    ~Chronos
