It's increasingly clear that we will never have a landslide election again, at least for a generation or more.  It seems that all elections are now destined to be close, as each side is fully entrenched, and no real debate happens anymore.    Don't get me wrong - I endorse the two party system as the best possible way of running the nation.  A parliamentary system of factions coming together long enough to govern before dissolving in rancor is not the way to go.  But it is clear that we have reached a point of irreconcilable differences between the two sides.  And I find that sad.  Particularly when we contemplate the magnitude of the challenge before us.  The crater of the World Trade Center, for a moment, looked like a scar that would bring us together with a common purpose.  Now, that crater has just been turned into an amphitheater, where both sides gather to hurl invective at one another.  It is the cusp of the fracture that is running through the country, and that frightens and amazes me.    I have honestly tried to understand those that say, to various degrees, that the WOT is unwinnable, should not be fought, should not be widened to Iraq, or should only be pursued with other nations that are clearly intending to block us on this.  I have tried to remain open to the arguments, but the stacks upon stacks of hard evidence limit my ability to seriously examine the flights of fancy of the entrenched Left.  Just as they believe I am a brainwashed zombie, I am now looking at them as aliens from another planet at best, and mentally damaged children at worst.  How can people cling to the idea that either Bush Knew, Bush Lied, Bush is Evil, or Bush is In Bed With Terrorists?  How can someone make the principled argument that Iraq is a failure in the face of so much evidence that things are going quite well there, or how can they ignore the historical precedent of occupation in Japan and Germany, with the same sort of insurgency and difficulties?  How can people blind themselves to history when the stakes are so high?  The other side can try to make the same argument about my positions, but for the life of me, I can't understand where they are coming from.  I can't comprehend a chain of events that suggests America is at fault, or a strong response is wrong, or that the establishment of freedom in another part of the world is wrong, immoral, or simply not our problem.  In the words of  urlLink Tony Blair ...    And I know it's hard on America, and in some small corner of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places I've never been to, but always wanted to go...   I know out there there's a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happily, minding his own business, saying to you, the political leaders of this country, "Why me? And why us? And why America?"   And the only answer is, "Because destiny put you in this place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is yours to do."    This   is   our task.  And I believe we should have honest debate how to go about it.  We should have honest discussion about the mechanics of war, the targets, the timing and so forth.  Instead, we are consumed with a gleeful desire to see our efforts fail, in the name of political gain.  In the months before the Iraqi War, we HAD a good debate on going to war, but once war is entered, the time for that debate has passed, and we must focus on making it work - not trying to see it fail so one can point to one's earlier objection.  We should be asking the question - what next?  We should be debating the need to strike Iran or Syria, instead of being dishonest about the occupation, the justification of war, and the ever growing evidence of WMD programs in Iraq.    This is an issue that goes beyond traditional politics.  If Clinton had been in office on 9/11 and he had been the strong one in the face of GOP resistance, I'd vote for him.  Nothing else matters at this point in time, and despite my issues with Bush, I see him not as the best man, but as the man defending the best ideas.  I don't give a crap about his affiliation, his social policies, and his economic policies, many of which I don't like.  This is a single issue election.  Let's be honest.  On 9/12/01, how many of you thought that we would go 34 months and counting without another attack on US soil?  Yet 40%+ of Americans think we are losing the War on Terror, or at best, not engaging it properly.  Where is the honest introspection?  Have we made mistakes in the War on Terror?  Of course we have.  We've blown some calls.  Iraq didn't have as much as we thought, but I believe we acted with honor in our misunderstanding of the true capability.  The WORLD thought Saddam had more, and I still believe that we don't yet have a good understanding of his true capabilities even now.  Abu Ghraib?  Yes, that was a mess.  Poor PR?  Absolutely.  It hasn't all been roses, but to paint these errors as evidence of utter failure is simply beyond my ability to comprehend.    The differences seem too great to breach.  How do you have a reasonable discussion with people who refuse to believe facts, or choose to embrace the lies of Michael Moore or the New York Times?  And how do you deal with it when the stakes are so very high?  I'm just worn out.
