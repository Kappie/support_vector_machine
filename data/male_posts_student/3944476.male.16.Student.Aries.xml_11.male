Maybe i'll practise later.      Fuckin cool discoveries:   1. Chocolates can kill dogs.   2. A hippopotamus can run faster than a man (whooo...)   3. 'Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia' is the fear of long words. (huh?)   4.It is impossible to lick your elbows. (Try it!)   5.Every 2000 frowns make a wrinkle.    6.Only human and horses have hymen (Er?)   7.During the female orgasm, endorphines are released, which are powerful painkillers. (So headaches are in fact a bad excuse not to have sex.)   8.The first known contraceptive was crocodile dung, used by Egyptians in 2000 B.C   9.There are two types of female orgasms. One called ciitorial orgasm and the other, vaginal orgasm.   10.The G-spot of a female is called the Grafenberg spot, named after the researcher who "discovered" it and sbout 10% of females can "ejaculate".
