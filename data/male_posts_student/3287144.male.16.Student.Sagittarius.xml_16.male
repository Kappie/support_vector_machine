My current movie recommendation is for Van Helsing. It's not really a great film, its alright but Richard Roxburgh is in it who is rather special in his own little way.  In other news I discovered that 'painting' your nails with permanent marker is  not  a good idea - I thought it was yesterday while idly colouring them in blue, now 24 hours on I have been able to get most of it off except the bits around the edges which prove to be the most annoying.  Finally my father managed to get a small bargain from Aldi yesterday, a Pocket PC, or a 'Multimedia Pocket PC PDA with GPS Navigation' to be precise. But like all things from Aldi which seem to good to be true, this little technological master piece isn't all that it could be. Think of it like this; just because it is a fraction of the size of a standard PC, doesn't mean you'll have a fraction of the problems - quite the opposite. Still it has Solitaire on it so I'm not too bothered plus I have managed to fix number of these problems.  Oh and at the bottom there is a link to do a practice theory exam; 26/35 means I failed!
