I have made some "major" decisions lately, first I will no longer attend David Lipscomb, I will not attend any graduate program this fall, and I am going to find a job.  Those who know me, know I have been a student a long long long time, it has been so long, I really did not think I was ever going to get a job!!!!!!!!!!!!  I believe now is the time to put the training and preparation into action,  I have a somewhat shaky prospect of a job, I am receiving mixed signals about it, other than that I have not pursued any other occupation.  I attribute to "fear of rejection" and "pride."  You would think those would not mix but I am a strange mixture of emotions.   I want a job for which I have been training for, it is not I think I too good to do internships or temp-work, but I have had my "desert experience/ training in humility."  I am bold/ arrogant enough to admit this but still so insecure in my thinking no one would want me.  This seems to be a confessional time, so I might as well let the whole thing spill.  I am timid in making these decisions because these are decisions where I am contingent upon someone's else decision about me.  I have had many many many rejections in my life from those I have extended my hand and heart to others for it to be crushed.  These are important times in my faith, where I must confess my weaknesses and rely upon the Lord's power to overcome my prickly thorns in/of the flesh.  Some of the Lord's power was evident this previous weekend at The National Campus Ministry Seminar, where contemporaries of much experience believed I was ready for the challenge of being a campus minister.  This was such a tremendous blessing to me.  I pray those who read this please pray for me, pray for boldness and confidence, not in my abilities but in this great narrative Jesus has included in a participant.  No matter the outcome, I will always have an identity, a role in an eternal cosmic play in which I get to play a major role.  I like to think we Chrisitans can  be seen as a lead actors in a play and on the program it would list:  Lead Actor(s)  Now playing the role of Jesus Christ is  Chad Monroe Chad Monroe's blog readers, etc...........   9 For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men. 10 We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored! 11 To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless. 12 We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; 13 when we are slandered, we answer kindly. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.
