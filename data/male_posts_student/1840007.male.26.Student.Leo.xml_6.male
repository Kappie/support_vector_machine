Yeah I was talking on my main blog about how i got some post, well i said it was my certificate for college, I also got KOF2002 in the post, i was a little disapointed that i didn't get my Megadrive games yet but that's ok as I've been waiting for this Dreamcast game for over 2 weeks now.  King of Fighters is such a bizarre game.  I'll admit that i havent played any of the proper series since I owned KOF 95 for my Sega Saturn, which was actually quite recent, it was one of the games i sold to that shop just there, I just hadn't played if for ages cos I didn't have a Sega Saturn.  Yeah it's a bizarre game cos although it's now on its tenth year it still basically looks th esame.  now i never really understood what Neo Geo was, I could understand it was an arcade system, but it was also a home console which played these cartridges which cost over Â£150.  And the console was basically the same as the arcade hardware?  So each of the arcade cabinets had a NEO Geo inside it and to save the arcade owner from buying a new cabinet all he was do do was change the cart?  Is all this right?  Well whatever, one thing that seems clear is that this Dreamcast game is a conversion and a Neo Geo Arcade game and it's quite a faithful one because it looks a little dated.  So the company that does all the King of Fighters games are still using the old technology from 10 years ago?  That's what it looks like cos this game isn't much different from the Saturn game i had in 1997.  It's just that this time there is less loading time.  good though, i quite like the KOF games, they're a little different to Street Fighter, the way the moves feel and all the rest, it's like you can feel the hits more mainly cos of the sound they make when they connect.  Plus they're always loads of characters, I dont think that i had played as everyone on the old Saturn version i had, they're always name copping up every here and there.  I'm keeping an eye on the  urlLink King of Fighter 10th anniversary  site and I'm findng out who's been in what game and all the rest.  But it's great it feels like I have that old Saturn game back except it's on the Dreamcast, i don;t mind though.  A lot of people always moan that all 2d fighting games are the same when people are talking about Street Fighter in fact i was reading this one review of some 2D fighter and they were saying that to say that all 2D fighting games are the same is like saying that NFL2K is the same as a John Madden game.  Though I would say that KOF is unashamedly similar, whereas when yo ulook at a new Street Fighter game they always look better everytime.  Anyway, KOF2002, good stuff, i just wish i could play the newer ones on my PS2 without having to mess around with it's insides, i dunno maybe i better look into buying a Japanese system.
