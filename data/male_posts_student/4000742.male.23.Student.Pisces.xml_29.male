To be fair, it was a really good paper on the following counts:   It covered every aspect of the subject taught so far. Nearly every concept had found a place in the paper.  The marks were also proportionately given - only objective-type questions for the basics, and then more marks for progressively more important things like accounting standards, profit and loss accounts and balance sheets.  It was fully application-oriented - no theory questions. I must say that even though I had a feeling I was not doing very well, I enjoyed writing the paper.   The main thing that went against it was its length. It was an impossibly lengthy paper and I could attempt questions worth only 27 marks out of a total of 35 marks. Of course, in such situations, Relative Grading comes to the rescue. There are hardly a few (mostly C.A.s) who have been able to complete the paper.  On the lighter side, this paper makes me rework Sahir Ludhianvi's words from the Rafi-Mukesh  qawwali  in the film ' Phir Subah Hogi ' (these lines have been sung by Rafi):  ' phirate the jo bhi sikandar bane hue, baithe hain sar pakadke, kabootar bane hue jis  subject  men ye haal ho, us  subject  se tauba, tauba! '
