I want to tell people what it is, but I'd rather surprise them in person XD.   After the car shopping, my mom and I went to Ruby Tuesdays and I drank 4 hand mixed cherry cokes lol. When we finished, my mom dropped me off at a bowling alley so i could meet with the gang and play a few, but unfortunately due to strict parents and curfew, it ended after the first game, lol. 9 people playing tends to take up a good amount of time though, even with 2 lanes, so the game did last worth the time in going.   Tomorrow school starts, I'm excited, but I think the car thing is overpowering the school excitedness, so I don't really think too much of it right now.  In any case, tomorrow's going to be interesting for sure ^___^
