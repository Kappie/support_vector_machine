My dad just told me that we were going to go to the shore and that he wanted me to get my hiar cut before we went; it makes me look like a girl because old men with siccors and "style" don't mix very well, oh well it'll grow back (This whole haircut thing has to do with a long story I can tell you when I get back). Anyways, we're headed for the shore, Ocean City or somewhere on the Outer Banks, it's really not decided yet, but on the way we'll be passing through Washington D.C. and stopping to view Reagan's coffin.  Won't be back till Monday or late Sunday. Later.  urlLink My Homepage
