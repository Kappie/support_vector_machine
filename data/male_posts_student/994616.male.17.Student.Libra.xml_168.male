I dont remember much except there was this part where i was going down a road and it got all twisty and stuff (not just left and right twisty but it kinda went up on its side and stuff) it just kept getting twistier untill it was practivally verticle on it side.  as this was happenigng the doad was heading deeper into a half stereotypical forrest / half canadian type forrest. and there were kinda spirits around. Apparently (no joke this is what happened) whenever you buy an apple product someone's spirit gets trapped there. lol  I had another dream which as far as i can tell had two possible endings. It starts off with this giant game of hide and seek in version 1 i run and hide in this abandoned building, of coruse the abadnoned beulding turns oout to be a hotel, which ahs a very odd elecator and hall structre. it seemed to be based on triangles. The other ending is where i go to hide in this confectionary store and end up working there and integrating all their computer so that they have a much faster business or soemthing like that, but then i had to go because the camp counselors were angry at me for hiding out of bounds (how the hell was i supposed to kow)
