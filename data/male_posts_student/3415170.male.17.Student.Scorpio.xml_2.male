My friends are all at Kevin's house having a great time playing Halo. Why am I here? Two words: my mother. We can all learn a thing or two from her, mainly how effectively one can make the  least  sense. But as a rash of poison ivy, the more I itch the more the rash spreads. So, back Saturday night.  Let me look at what I do have; I have the internet, an Xbox, Law and Order: SVU, and lots of soda. I'm not going to even attempt Xbox, as that was the focus of last night (Friday). L SVU is on and even though the audio of detectives chasing sexual predators may sound tempting I am typing this instead. That last sentence was supposed to read ..."I am instead typing this." but for some subliminal reason I changed that around. Can someone really eat 10 saltines in one minute?  Before I end this message I really must express that it is a shame you cannot hear what it is I think. Kidding myself that I have advanced thought patterns to everyone else is just an excuse that I can make so that I think that even though it seems as if I'm better than you, I'm not. You think about that now.  Screw it, I'm downing this Sujamma and upping my Balls level to 4.
