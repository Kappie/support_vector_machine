Throwdown, God Forbid, Otep, Unearth, Lamb of God, Lacuna Coil, Atreyu, HATEBREED, and last but cerntinly not least SLIPKNOT! I got there about 8:45 and waited in line. So i get in when Mike Chueffo called me. he was with Robert Rios and Harris. So we hung out when we met of with Casey and Aaron Johnson and Keven. My dad finally left and thats when mayham broke loose. I let out so much anger in the pit. All the stress of presenting an image was gone. After that Roachelle called me so we met up. I met her friend Merced. She was pretty cool. Merced wanted to see Atreyu so we made our way to the front of the crowd. They fucken rocked so hard. i didnt think they were gonna be so good. By the way jake got to crowd surf during Atreyu. So after them we waited fer fucken Lamb of God. That pit was crazy. So me and Casey whent to get fucken something to drink cuz we had seen Hatebreede before. (They sound just like there CD). Then the 9 gods were on. It took the stage crew like an hour just to set there tottally awsome equipment up.  Then we had to wait another hour fer them to come out. I swear between the pot being offered to me and being squished I could not breath. Then we see Joey come to the stage. he start up Liberate. then the rest of them hit the stage. It was the best experience of my life. I am not detirmend to see them in concert just them. It was funny Chiffuo wanted me to go in the pit. I said no but i was pushed in 5 sec. after he went in. So after me a Chiffo meet up and I find out he looses his wallet. He lost it in his back pocket. (Dumbass) So me and chiffuo get food. We miss black lable socity and suberjoint ritual. We make it back in time fer Dimmu Bijoru. They were ok, I didnt really like them. Me and Casey were just chillin when we relize that Kevin is fucken high off his as. This dude fucken had one of thoes tall ass fish bone coctail glasses. He thought it was a sword. So this chick comes up to him to ask for the "sword" so she can make a bong. Well to make a long story short. We lost a good sword. So neway me and Casey were making fun of Judist Prist cuz rob Halford is gay. He takes it in the but and like it. So I see my friend Chris Ayadia. He was with his gay friend that was trying to pick up on Roachelle. So kevin starts thowing grass on the dude to piss him off. Dude get up and fucken gets the shit kicked out of him and his best friend. (WORSHIP THE DEVIL) by the way thats an inside joke.  I DONT REMEMBER ANYTHING THAT HAPPEND FRIDAY  SaturdayMe and Michael kicked it. justin came over and so did tony. We hung out fer a while. Then tony went to elanes house. So me mike and justin go to justins house. he got the shit chewed out of him from his mom (not telling y). So we went inside justin like got ready fer the day cuz he claimed that he was not going home. So yea we picked up tony and elane and Elane goes "Jason take me to my friend chicken". She didnt ask she just told me. So yea start to piss me off plus Mike kept makeing fun of my driving. So when they got out of the car tony juped in and i took off. Yes I LEFT THEM THERE. No i dont regret it. It shows i cant be pushed around. So yea thats the end of that day.  Let see sunday, I studyed fer my Geometry final fer tommorw wish me luck guys.
