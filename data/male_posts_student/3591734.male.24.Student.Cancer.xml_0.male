The last I heard from myself, I was rambling on about Absinthe. Well, that plan never came to fruition, but now, with over a month left to drink and smoke myself silly, I'm sure it will manage to find a way to sneak back into my list of "how to drink and smoke yourself silly."  Yesterday was the bomb though. Had my little birthday party, unbeknownst to most, 2 days in advance. Vesbar's 10 drinks for 20 bucks cards were on that night, so you can sure that yours truly made the most of it. Surprisingly, no hangover present. Arrghhh... but my legs really hurt today though.  Warning: Two girls sitting in your lap may seem like fun at the time.  This calls to mind a transcendental Zen quote by my good friend Arun. I can't remember the exact quote, but it went something like "If you piss in front of a tiger, be prepared to face the consequences."
