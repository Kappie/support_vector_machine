When it comes to girls, I never seem to get a break. Well atleast we talk sometimes, there's just so much I like about this girl, I've never felt so strongly about anything in my life. Some might find this crazy, but I remember almost every detail of the different times I've spent with her, though very limited. I'm happy being her friend n all, but it sucks when she's all that plagues my freakin mind. Even when I try to think of something else, I always seem to end up relating everything to her. Everything reminds me of her. I'm going fuckin crazy, and I have no idea what to do about it. It's like I'm going through withdrawl. I even went and told her that my thoughts were like diabeties, and she was my sugar(want me to explain more, ask me). I told her alot of how I feel, but it doesn't seem to do much. I'm torn in two. One side of me just wants to get over her because it just seems hopeless, but then there's this side of me that just,"Don't Give Up, If there's one thing you shouldn't give up is her." I hate this shit, that's why I always kept my heart small(reference to Saosin), so I wouldn't have to feel like this.
