Well I didn't need this I already felt down as it was. When we got to school he ended up saying stuff that was really hurtful and I couldn't take it. I think from then on I couldn't look at my father the same again. I broke down. I think that's why I always feel down. I never really that often get to the high points in my life.  aint life funny how it makes you remember old times when new stuff happen you start to feel a sense of nostalgia. i think it could also be why i found my self getting in trouble at my old school it was cause i was haveing problems at home and i didnt like the school my so i started to muck around and mess up. it funny how things just come to you.  i am currently making a video for a media assign ment i am doing and it all rather feels quite easy for some reason i am just breezing through the subject like it was the easiest subject in the world. i dont know why it comes so easy mybe it was somthing i was born to do but i dont know i just take it one step at a time.  i find that the more you write down the harder it is to think of mre stuff to write down.  so i'll leave it hear so not to risk of having nothing to write when i post next.
