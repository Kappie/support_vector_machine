The smallest things make the biggest changes, somehow. Today, I went rafting. I think. Well, we got a raft and intertube and floated down some river, which I forget it's name. It goes around this waterpark and all, it's nice, slow, smooth, calm. The whole thing took about two hours, to float around. It was fun, I guess. That was about all I did today, nothing else much really. Not feeling like making such a post at the moment. I'll throw the drama at your sorry ass in a few hours. For right now, time to waste some time while I nap. A nap would do me good, maybe help me feel better? :: Shrug :: Bleh, I got news on Nihon Port and Nemui Kosetsu which I'll give you later.
