Ok...sounds like the often misunderstood 'Seeing you so happy makes me happy'. But isn't it so true that we really feel like that. Do we not find joy when we see joy in others? And feel pain for the person as you stand by the person feeling so hurt? And it feels great now to see that people around me are happy.  Recently, I've been just bored. It's like I want to have fun but don't know how. Oh well, but at least I have things to be occupied now. And not to forget all my band activities during the holidays. Just dread it. Maybe I should pray for a gift. Gift of music or singing. If only I could deny my passion for music. But I just can't do music well. And I can't sing well too. Sometimes we just wish we could choose our talents. Like at the start of every Role-playing Game. Where you decide certain skills that you will eventually be better at. Well, but life isn't about choice, but the will of God. Either way, if we were always given our own choices, maybe our lives would be in a mess then. Like everyone says, God knows what's best for us.
