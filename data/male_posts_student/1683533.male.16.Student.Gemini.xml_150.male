If you want to make a name for yourself in punk in 2004, do the following:  1. Be from an upper middle class or wealthy family. If you can't tour constantly nobody will sign you and you can't tour constantly if you have to worry about things like holding onto a job in order to pay bills.  2. Move to California.  3. Copy the crap on the radio. That's what sells. Don't forget the choreographed jumps, hair dye and gel, tattoos, and strategically ripped clothes. But make sure to hedge your bets; don't start getting a lot of tattoos until you've really made it and go with a Safety-Hawk until fame permits you to shave the sides of your head.   4. Kiss a lot of ass. In fact, just to be safe, kiss every ass you see. Fake enthusiasm for the shittiest bands, 'cause they'll be the ones to hit it big, at which point you'll be well-positioned to ride their coattails.   5. Get your wealthy family to funnel you some cash so you can hire an entertainment lawyer, a manager and publicist, for starters.   6. Make sure your politics are correct. Be as rabidly left-wing as possible. If you're ambidextrous, you can write anti-Bush songs with one hand and rake in the profits with the other. The wealthier you grow, the louder you should be in complaining about the wealthy. And don't forget to remind everyone that you're still a punk rocker.   7. Upon gaining fame and fortune, forget where you came from as quickly as possible. The people in your past should consider themselves lucky to have been graced by your presence. Since they can't do anything for your career now, forget them, unless it's to drop their name when you're in need of some punk rock credibility.   8. Never forget, there is no such thing as enough money. When the people you surround yourself with to manage your career tell you to be worried, as they always will, be worried. That way you'll make as much money as possible, and the only others who will benefit will be those keeping you paranoid about not having enough money.   9. When people point and laugh at you for being a ridiculous performing monkey with no character, balls or talent, just tell yourself they're jealous. That's what Kevin Costner does and it seems to work for him.   10. Having made a fortune parading around like a cartoon, start making "serious" music.
