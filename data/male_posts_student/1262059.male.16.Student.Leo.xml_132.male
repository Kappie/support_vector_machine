I hope you guys had fun at the con! Tell me what you guys did there! I am curious ^^;; ahh.. today, I managed to finish 2 math units.. good, but not good enough.. i need to arrange for myself to finish some english units before this night (or morning - watever) is done. Hopefully my parents don't suddenly wake out of nowhere - they have a habit of doing that - and yell at me to go to sleep.   Umm.. lot'sa people saw Matrix: Reloaded today... i want to see too :'( demo.. i guess i'll have to wait to summer ^^ I rewatched the original Matrix last night...I plan on using it for some assignment thingy.   Ah.. i think i really need to disappear off the face of the earth for 3 weeks to concentrate my full energy on the task at hand. The consequences for failing is too much to imagine... I rather not waste time thinking about it.   Umm.. on a cheery note, *thinks* um... well.. it's summer soon? ehhehhehehheh    kkkkkeeeeeeaaaaaannnnnneeeeeee... talk to me will ya?    ~Chronos
