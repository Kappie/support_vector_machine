Joe's Blogger wont let him update his Template for some reason, and although I was originally going to change my template, I guess that can wait for another time...  Umm... I can't really think of much more to put... *thinks* *shrugs* If I think of anything I'll come back...  when I have time ... -.-*  Oh yah...
