 Its the 4th time this summer, hoping it can be a simple battery problem and not something with the starter again. 
 
 I asked Roger Cavallo and Rosemary Mullick to be the two professors on my thesis committee. I'm having Keith Johnson still read and mark mistakes, I'm hoping to get the thesis in to them sometime tomorrow so they can look at it, and I begin to hope everything is alright.
