I wonder how often this feeling is going to get me over, pick me up the ground and throw me to ectasy, teasing me softly and remaining as elusive as the mirage, telling me that the show must go on and then making me sleepy, making things appear beautiful and then stealing my every time to glance at them. Its just crazy. I can bear all the pain of burning midnight oils, reading someone else's PhD thesis and writing for paper for some journal, whose editor, you feel is an ****ole. Yeah, its happening. In my dreams and in my reality, in my every notion, I think of it. I amliving for that moment and that moment seems to be appearing in the distant horizon of december. I am graduating. I am, indeed, graduating. The underdog is surprising everyone. I will be graduting this december. I applied for graduation this friday and I have started believing that I can do it this december. And if providence is in love with me unlike past, then I may go for a PhD in Purdue. Shreekant and Amar all are all those fine buddies. I can't really wait to be with them.I don't know though, how to celebrate it. If it had been a year ago, I would have grabbed a budwiser, ok may be, more than just one and couple of calls to Vikram, Vineet and all those cell phone no.s lying in my phone book. But, my annual celebration for Teetolism is on, and I really don't want to again start drinking. I am a bad drinker I must admit. Or, rather I was, atleast. But, I made few calls to my friends I guess.
