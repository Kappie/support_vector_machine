We were going decidedly average tonight I must say. usually we kick veritable butt. Anyways, that's beside the point. During the night, they have sections where you can win free jugs of beer. The last one of these 'win a free jug' things was a joke one. You had to write down a joke and the best one won a free jug. My baby harp seal joke won out...  (One for the hippie tree-huggers)  "A baby harp seal walks into a club....."  Jimmy (the guy who runs the trivia gig) laughed his ass off. So we won. Oh yeah!  So now I'm (still) drunk.    LX.
