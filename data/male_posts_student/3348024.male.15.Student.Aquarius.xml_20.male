Will wants to know what happened to B to the Rad.  Umm... well, that sorta faded out, but I suppose you could still call me that if you would like.  I just wanted to take this oppurtunity to give a shout out to General Tim.  Many of his jokes and amusing stories will be posted on this site.  He and I have developed Missing Turnip Trilogy, which will soon be posted.  I would also like to give a shout out to General Custard who despite smelling funny has also added to the resevoir of stories.  I'd also like to recognize K-Unit.  Way to be homie... and Amber.  You're awesome, glad we met.  K-Unit  Amber, I'm not really sure what to say it's unfortunate what had to happen but i dunno.  so...  Rock On.  I've also gotta give a shout out to Steve-O.  Hey man, you rock, sucks that your movin to vegas.  Adam apparently isn't content with only having one sentence, cause usually he can't have just one thing at a time.  Like if he's eatin a cheeseburger, ya know he's gonna ask for another and another..... and another  Well Adam, here it is, I hope you're happy.  Wookie, you're crazy as fuck and you're the only kid i know that sounds like a wookie.    Props to Travis.  He's had the same same lameass pos name on msn forfuckinever.  3.1415 days later... Travis still has the Milk Man name.
