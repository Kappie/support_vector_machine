Let's discuss my last post.  On Wednesday night my mum forced me to go to a crappy careers evening at school. I was in a mood. I just rolled my eyes repeatedly while the speakers were giving their presentations. And I fidgeted. Basically I had an attitude. My mother did not approve of this. Once in the car she kept asking me what my problem was. Needless to say I was not amused. I just acted all high and mighty and went into a sarcastic mood. We yelled. And I felt like someone died. I just felt really bad and suicide crossed my mind. Only for a minute or two. But still. As I cut up carrots for my animals I kept staring at the blade and my wrists tingled. I even visualised it. I think I had some sort of emotional breakdown. I can't really remember with my whole emotional amnesia thing. All I know is that I felt like crying, as if I was grieving a loss. But I didn't. I wish I had. Maybe it would have made this whole thing easier.  Now I'm giving myself something to do. My cry for attention. You all know I'm needy. How far will it go? Have you noticed yet? You probably saw me doing it but dismissed it, or better yet, didn't even acknowledge it. How long will it be before you say something? It's funny really. Will any of you figure it out? Here's hoping. Or maybe here's hoping not. Do I know what I want? Not likely.
