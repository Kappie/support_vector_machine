Learning Jesus' last name isn't Christ, that's just his "Holy Position." Haha Amanda. Lunch, I found out someone had told the principal on Heaton for having bad stuff in his blogger. Originally this blog was full of evil stuff but for now on, I'm going to be nice in my blogger, until I find out who this reporter is and ask him if he cares if I have bad stuff in my blogger. Heaton didn't actually get in trouble because it's not really a school matter but his mom and him had a meeting with the 10th grade principal. That lady scares me, when I received detention from her, she shoved her face in mine and started yelling, then some dude said SIGN THIS! God damnit, I really want to say some horrible and cruel things but I can't, god it's so hard to hold back all these emotions against all the retarded things and people in life. I feel really bad for Heaton. Heaton always makes fun of me for hating authority, but now I know he probably feels the same. Ok, I'll tell you the actual story, Heaton said in his blogger that Jason OConnor should die. Then someone reported him, I believe it's OConnor and the principal told OConnor to say it was someone else who reported Heaton, so nothing bad starts to break out. I can almost guarantee it was Heaton because when I was with Jason alone, he kept saying how Heaton was a psycho and belongs in a mental home and he sounded threatened by Heaton. And I quote... James "Tom, Heaton got reported...By Oconnor." Me - "OConnor did you really?" OConnor - "Yes." When Heaton showed up, he denied it. But just in case it isn't OConnor who reported Heaton, I'm keeping my blogger nice and happy until I'm 100% sure it was Oconnor. Come on, it's obviously OConnor, why would anyone else report Heaton, unless they have a gigantic grudge on Heaton. But as everyone knows, Heaton is loved by all...Except OConnor which allows me to come to my conclusion, OConnor is the reporter. If it's you big JO, I'll just have to say, that is very sad. Back to my real life, I babysat today, pain in the royal ass, and uh...Now I'm doing homework and watching the Yankee game with it's spectacular Star Wars intro. Ok bye, and hopefully I'll know by tomorrow who reported Heaton. As you can see, I really enjoy defending Heaton. Wait, if Heaton didn't actually get detention, he only had his parents find out...Then what am I afraid of? MY PARENTS CAN CARE LESS! THEY'RE WORSE THAN ME! (= Ok, so here's how it goes. The Gay/Lesbian orientation...WAS AMAZINGLY HORRIBLE! I feel like Holden Caulfield criticizing everything but it's fun doing this. The Gay/Lesbian orientation, I tried so damn hard not to laugh, I let out a snort. Then the girl said "Daddy Fucker" while reading a poem a gay kid wrote. That's when my face turned beat red because I was holding in the laughs. Wow, why should people be complaining how gay people be harassed and stressed out, why not complain how school sucks 10' dick, that's right, 10 feet, not inches. People should be complaining and revolting about the government, about our liberal rights, about all the gay laws, about how school is giving us fucking too much work and no freedom! WHY DO WE NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL! Life sucks. Period. No, there's no exceptions to that, life sucks unless you're rich and don't have to take shit from nobody. Here's my real opinion on the kid who reported Heaton. We're in high school you god damn duckweed! Are you that immature and retarded? You suck so much, you should leave Earth. That is all. Oh yes, gay people are called faggets because a fagget is a bundle of sticks and in the holocaust, they used to burn gay people alive on bundles of sticks. Horrible, I don't wanna use that word anymore but I guarantee I will use it again. Probably about 20 times tomorrow. Ok, now I really gotta stop procrastinating and do my homework. Goodbye everyone and get ready for another randy dandy blog for tomorrow.
