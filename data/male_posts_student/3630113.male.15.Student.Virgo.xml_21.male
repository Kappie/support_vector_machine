Common tests have been fine i suppose...they weren't really difficult to the extent that i had to scratch my head half the time to try to squeeze something out of my brain...whenever i have vital info inside that is...a maths yesterday was kind of murderous. totally had no idea how to do a question..'cos i didn't understand it at all..until last 5 minutes when i just rushed through it..and i think i managed to get it correct.hehe. but i stumbled upon other difficult questions or when i really had no idea how to continue..argh...oh well..no choice but to wait for the paper to come back..recess..wah...stoopid aiks...came coming after me with my ball 'cos he was trying "dodgeball" wth man...mr softball obviously throws with consummate precision and vicious strength...so yeah...i managed to sustain couple of hits.hah...eventually i took refuge in the staff room..haha..saw kee guan and andy outside there actually..and they wanted to go see soh to ask about the chemistry grade...whew...i got an a2..haha..soh said i even beat lim young...erps...heheh hope that's a compliment though..haha...aiya...actually it's nothing la..i think lim young just didn't do as well as he hoped for...'cos probably he stumbled a bit was quite careless la..in other words he was most likely just "off form" yeah...so yeah...hope i keep it up..heh.  later had geog..wah...another tough paper...melvin chng...god...trying to slaughter us to bits...it was so bloody tough..man...hope i do okie man...had to go see wongsm later...i thought it was nothing much..'cos she said see her after school for a short while(it's a direct translation) so i did...i was still planning to catch i, robot with nic after the "short" meeting with her...wah piang....it turned out she wanted us to go to sajc for the chinese song writing competition thing for a meeting..oh man..so gj cheng liang and i made our way there first..got there quite early..think 30 mins before the scheduled time...wah...was under scrutiny from the sajc people man...people casthing curious gazes...probably insulted ones too..they didn't feel too comfortable with our presence i think...i mean it's their school right...yawnz...so well...went in sit there for a while and waited for the rest to arrive...wah...eventually we found out that...all of us wouldn't be able to sing...'cos when wongsm submitted the cd which contained the recording of the song...the people judged it according to that cd...so that now we had the chance to actually perform it this time...omg...so turns out willy was the only one that could sing...and guo jun was the lyrics-writer..at least for parts of the song...so yeah..the both of them stayed there to take pics and stuff...bloody hell..wongsm made us go all the way to sajc...and we wasted our time there...wat the hell man...i could have gone to watch i, robot!!!argh. crap man...when i gave her a call she didn't even apologise to us or anything..dammit man...she'd better allocate higher marks to the 8 of us for today's test..at least for the six of us who went sajc and did nothing...argh.
