So waited at the canteen with Esmond n friends for pple to come n help out the door gifts and banner for LEO camp. Yah... In the end did 237 door gift (so proud of the grp man). Now juz hope that the clay will harden by tml so we get paint on it.... Rather tiring but fun....    After the ding went spotlight n popular buy stuff 4 the painting tml until bout 5pm. Then I part with my friends n go library (tot can sleep thr n wait 4 the rest) and found tat it's closed lol... Then no choice, went grab some stuff to eat but then no $$$ coz I paid 4 all the stuff for the camp ding lor. So ended up eating Ice Kachang @ east link mall. Wat a waste lor I scope the ice till half drop on the table lol. Hiaz today juz not my day man.  Then haf meeting for the cultural doc. ding at 7. We went to a pavillion at sunplaza park to discuss the thing and it's like so isolated n full of insects lol. The gals thr were like always complaining bout it lol. But finally we mange to make the meeting short n sweet.  Have dinner at east link mall again... alone.... then take the wrong bus home. Took 29 instead of 291. Can't blame mi lah can't see clearly in the dark. Then walk home from Sunplaza park thr coz I alight thr and the route is so damn long lor. I'm like all wet when I reach home lol...  Today's juz not my day man...
