While the book presents interesting scenarios that we can all learn from, I don't think it is an accurate representation of what reality is. I honestly believe that there is a lack of true integrity in the business world. The days of the "handshake" to seal a deal are long gone. The evolution of litigation has a great deal to do with this. What is moral has been replaced with what can we get away with legally?  We face many ethical issues in the coming century that will define the future of health care. Issues that we are currently struggling with now may be commonplace in society. The lack of a basic health care for all has certainly surfaced many ethical issues for us. The divide of what is financially feasible and what is morally justified will be the most difficult challenge faced by health care administrators. I look to meet these challenges with vigor, and I hope that the choices that I make in a will restore integrity and morality to the health care field.
