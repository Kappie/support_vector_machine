But being as nothing really has been going on for the past so many days, I have had no reason to put any new posts on this here blog. In fact, I have not really had any desire to blog either. Overall, I think its a fair trade.    The only thing I want to put on this post are my current favorites in the music department. Don't ask why, because I don't know either. I'll do my best to keep it to a 10 point maximum here. Actually, I'm going as far as I want to, which is probably a bad idea, being as my playlist is 106 songs long... (As you can see, I am somewhat bored right now...)    1) We Still Kill the Old Way -  Lost Prophets   2) Best of Me - Starting Line   3) Desert Rose -  Sting   4) Beautiful Ways -  The Pat McGee Band   5) Stand by Me -  Oasis   6) Stop Crying Your Heart Out -  Oasis   7) Wonderwall -  Oasis   8) Hey Julie - Fountains of Wayne   9) Counting Blue Cars -  Dishwalla   10) 100 Years - Five for Fighting   11) Superman -  Five for Fighting   12) One More Time -  Daft Punk   13) Brick -  Ben Folds (Five)   14) Army -  Ben Folds (Five)   15) Rocking the Suburbs -  Ben Folds (Five)   16) Mr. Bartender - Sugar Ray   17) Letters to You -  Finch   18) I Stand Alone - Godsmack   19) Serenity -  Godsmack   20) Certain Shade of Green -  Incubus     Twenty will work. Don't want to completely go insane here with this. I missed plenty of songs that are at the top of my favorites list but those can wait for another pointless blog entry. Have fun with this.
