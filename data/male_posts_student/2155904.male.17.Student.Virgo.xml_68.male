Just the two of them but still Tyke had fun.  He was quite surprised at the coincidence of seeing Michael King at the game though.  He came from doing a story on a wrestler over at Newport or Sammamish and then came to do some film of the game.  So Tyke and Kinker went over and talked about stuff.  To specify one of the stuff topics, Michael asked if Tyke or Kinker had any girlfriends on the team.  Well of course they responded no.  So he then asked if they had any prospects or something like that.  Well, knowing Tyke you know where this is gonna go.  Tyke responds, "Yeah, I pursued one girl but she would have nothing of it."  So Michael then asked which girl it was later and Tyke pointed out Tina.  So then when Tina got the ball, Michael was like, "Hey #10's got the ball."  Ahhh, good times.  Yet another person knows about Tyke and Tina.  Maybe Tyke is being too willing to tell everyone his feelings and all.  Maybe that makes Tina feel uncomfortable.  Well that is definitely not his intention.  He is just comfortable in having everybody know what he feels.  That way he has something of a support group.  Well anyway the girls won and that was cool.  There was a total of 3 IHS students at the game not affiliated with the game or Tyke or Kinker.  But on the way home Tyke and Kinker managed to strike up the subject of Kram for a little.  They talked about how Kram has talked about Tyke a little bit before.  Apparently talking with Frederique while doing so and basically how Tyke was a turd.  That isn't such a bad thing though.  If someone was in love with your girlfriend (or ex...) then there would probably be some somewhat harsh feelings.  And apparently Kram thought Tyke was being too forward and should back off.  Now that is stupid.  Tyke definitely did not need to back off.  Does walking together before and after class and Tyke coming to her sports events qualify as being too forward?  It certainly shouldn't.  Sure he was head over heels for her but that didn't mean he was buying her flowers and candy and singing her songs outside her window in the pouring rain at night (which sounds fun...something Tyke could do in the future perhaps).  He was just being friendly.  It is not like he was planning a time to jump Kram in the halls and stab him (never came to his mind either...seriously folks, come on).  Another thing.  The fact that they are not together does not make Tyke's situation any better just to let you know.  It's not like Tyke is going to go after her again now.  And regarding him and her perhaps going to prom together.  He is a little sketchy on that too.  Like if he did ask her he couldn't make it a surprise.  There are only so many times he can face rejection from one girl without losing total faith.  He has already been rejected twice by her.  Yeah, twice.  Once in 9th grade he believes.  That wasn't quite as bad though as this year's as it wasn't straight up coming out and hitting her with it.  But it still hurt a little then.  Man, this girl has taken 4 years of my life.  And she hardly even knows it really.  The time he has spent thinking about her is remarkable.  Oh well...this was just an appendage to the last blog so he should probably wrap it up.  And right now his mood is not depressed or sad or anything.  He is fine now.  Not great but just doing good.  And good is good.  So that is all.  Time to do other things such as sleep.
