I had my digital arts class and realized that I need to do my project mostly in illustrator due to the largeness of the project. I really don't want to deal with 50 MB psd files. I went to the library and discovered that we don't have issues of  New Masses  between 1932-1934, despite having all the other years. Talk about lame. After that I worked out, chit chatted with two friends named Eric and now I'm enjoying a smoothie and Jeno's pizza.  Oh yea my little brother is transferring from UCSC to UCI. Good stuff... perhaps...  In rotation right now is  Bigwig 's  Invitation To Tragedy  (2001), and  Propagandhi 's  Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes  (2001).  ***
