Here's a conversation i had with an idiot today-  (dont think im overreacting, im constantly having to tell this prick i hate CS)   Idiot: com to my cs lan today Idiot: com right now ShuChoMouff: dude- what the FUCK is your problem? ShuChoMouff: do you do that on purpose or are you just a retard? ShuChoMouff: I HATE CS ShuChoMouff: so SHUT THE FUCK UP Idiot:  everyone likes it butu ShuChoMouff: what the FUCK is there not to get? Idiot: i think u jus do that to be differnt ShuChoMouff: you're such a fuck ShuChoMouff: dont talk to me ShuChoMouff: until you wanna stop being an asshole  All cs people i know- ALL OF THEM- think its completely IMPOSSIBLE for me to hate it. And i do. So call me the devil all you want(christians do it all the time), but don't mess with me about cs.  Now, if the idiot i was talking to lightens up, i may just delete this post, but until then, it stays.  What's wrong with CS, you ask? What is CS, you ask?  CS, or Counter-Strike,  is a little mod made for the hit game Half-Life by developer Valve Software. There are 2 teams. Terrorist, and Counter-Terrorist.  The Terrorist's goal is simple. Plant some kind of explosive where there is a biiiig target, and all the while keep the Counter-terrorists from rescuing any hostages they may have around the map.  The Counter-Terrorist's goal is simple. Rescue any hostages the Terrorists may have scattered around the map, and keep the terrorists from planting the bomb by either killing all the terrorists, or defusing the bomb once it's been planted.  And it's like this, over and over and over and over.  Problems? What problems? here are some.  1. No plot. Whatsoever. None. Zip. Zero.  2. It looks like crap. The Half-Life engine used to look great, but now it's just a bunch of polygons.  3. When you die, you have to wait what seems like 3 years just to get back into the game. So if you're a newbie, you're fucked.  4. It's not fun. It's the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over (etc...)  5. Most everybody who plays it is a complete asshole. It almost never fails- cs makes you a hybrid jerk-idiot.  6. Hacks- almost everyone who has the damn game has some way to cheat the game- either with being able to see thru walls, or have a program that aims perfectly for them, or invincible mode, something to that effect.  Why does noone see these faults? CS is the most popular online game in the world, apparentally, according to some secretive reviewing organization. Are humans that blind? Apparentally, yes.  I think the There servers are coming back up soon, I'll see you all later!
