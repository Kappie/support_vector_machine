It's just kind of a funny clip, regardless of who you support.  But they've taken it down.  You've probably seen it on TV by now anyway.  Hopefully.  The prospective law student's version of Dean's speech:  "If you had told me one year ago that I was going to get admitted to the nation's third-ranked law school, I would have given anything for that.  "I'm going to get admitted to Yale! And Stanford! And Columbia! And NYU! And Chicago! And Georgetown! And Duke! And Virginia! And Penn!  "And then I'm going to go to the University of Phoenix Online and get them accredited -- with my bare hands!  "YAAAARGGGH!"
