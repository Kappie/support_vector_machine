I seem to hav a problem chatting with people. I am always only asking the same questions e.g. how are you, how are your studies etc...  3. I can't afford to spend money and time talking and sending SMSes to my girlfriend.  2. I don't have money to splash/spend on my girlfriend.                             .                             .                             .                             .                             . Top reason why I can't and don't have a girlfriend : (drumroll)  My parents banned me from having one! (until I enter a unversity anyway)  Anyway, I think reasons number 2  3 are sufficient. It wouldn't be fair to my girlfriend. So from the things I have mentioned above, you can come to the conclusion that I am very much single, haha....
