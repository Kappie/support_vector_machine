Reach school at 8.45am, Mr Chandra said the common briefing for both class 01 and 02 starts at 10am, ap -_-''      Then Mr Chandra and Mr Idris started briefing us at 10am+... talking about all the same old rules... going to fall asleep -_-...zzZ Saw a spider on the ground while they were talking and after a few minutes when I look at the ground again, the spider was gone.      After that we were separated into different groups (same group as the Chinatown trip) and sitting arrangements. Wow, each of us get a desk to ourselves, haha, the desk is so big ^_^      Then we were asked to write reflections on the sketches we had done... sooo boring... I just write whatever I can think of and the air-con is so cold (16 degrees) that we had to go to the toilet to warm ourselves. Speaking of toilet, the male toilet near W15 is very 'smoky' cause everytime I went in, there is cigarette smell.       After about half an hour of writing, finally finish. So we went to look for the photoshop (which was very far from W15) to help print our photos, but due to some problems, we had to go back (a long long way...) to look for Mr Chandra to help print our photos. Went back to the Multimedia Lab and saw him... because there are no papers in the printer, so we cannot print out the photos. So after all this walking and walking and not eating lunch, we just wasted our time.      In the end, we had to make do with the 5 pictures we had. Went to see sketches of other people... I very de Zi Bei, all draw so good one... my one like cartoon... *_*      Finally can go off liao, me, Victor, Raymond and Jun Qing went off first, leaving behind Meme and Xin Hao. On the way past the sports hall, I sign up for the Chess Club, hahaha... -_-''' mad... den went to eat KFC. I went off first cause I'm going back to eat and I went over to the sports hall first to sign up for the Chinese Orchestra. Originally I wanted to join the String Ensemble but the practice is on Mon (5-7pm) and Tues (7-9pm) so quite troublesome and it would be very late when I got home.      Played bball at night again, today got bo, jd, kp, kh, jh, wp, zx, wh and me playing. Went to the court and saw people kicking soccer again... O_O# hate those who kick soccer at basketball court, everytime has to change place. But today got more people playing bball then soccer so not scared of them. Met the two guys from yesterday and a few more other guys. There are 14 of us so had to separate into 4 teams (3,3,4,4). We selected the captains (jd, kh, bo and one of the guy from yesterday)So the teams are choosen - Team 1: The two guys from yesterday and a muscular guy, Team 2: Bo, a very big guy and a guy in red shirt, Team 3: kh, wp, wh and me, Team 4: jd, kp, jh and zx.      Team 1 vs Team 2: Team 1 won. Team 3 vs Team 4: Team 3 won. Yay. Then final match, Team 1 vs Team 3: we won, hahaha ^_^ After that we decided to play full court, 7 on each team -_-''' (Team 1: Two guys from yesterday, muscular guy, wp, zx, kh and jd, Team 2: Red shirt guy, bo, wh, kp, jh, an tamil guy and me) alright it is a bit confusing when we just started playing but it is still very confusing after we've played for some time. ,,_-_ Team 2 loses and another team (those who are playing soccer on the court) challenges Team 1. Wh then went to hp.      After the lights went off, we went to buy water and sat down to talk again, wh came with xx later on. Some policemen came to ask us about some malay guys... blah blah blah. We continue talking and talking and went home.         Transport taken today: Bus 74     Feeling: Very full
