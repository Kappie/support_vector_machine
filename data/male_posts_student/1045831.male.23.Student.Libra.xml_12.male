Lots of movies with Claudia lately but it's pretty fun..  Then I went home and watched some tube and studied some more physics...  went to sleep and basically just studied and did boring things since then..  but I have done well on all my finals which is nice..  ok I just wrote some stuff cuz i felt I was slacking...  I will have more after tommorrow cuz it is my last final and then I am drinking!!!
