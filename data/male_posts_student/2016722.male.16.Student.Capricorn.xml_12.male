Everybody in the mall is so depressing, especially the Easter bunny and every person who walks into Abercrombie. Everywhere you look there's some smiling blonde staring at you. Not to mention all of the jewelry stores. Everybody is the same. Anyway, we also stopped at the bank and I deposited all of my money, not much, into a savings account, so now I'll have an ATM card with which I can deposit and withdraw money. Cool, hopefully the card will get here by the time we leave for Italy. Hm I also got a Messenger bag so I can have a carry on to the plane and not get ripped off in Italy, and one of those little dollar store quality necklace wallets for like.. 10 bucks. I think its exactly the same one that our chaperone has, how embarrasing. Anyway, math... Chapter 13 "Further work with trigonometry". Great.
