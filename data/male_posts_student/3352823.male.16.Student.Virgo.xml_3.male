The first hour was dedicated to the 'red carpet' which was actually a string of interviews with people no one really cared about. Sure there were some performances (i.e. La Toya) but everything else was just something we've heard before. Had they executed some fantasic twist, like the runner up actually being the winner, or bringing back La Toya into the competition then it would have made the two hours really exciting. Instead... It dragged on and on and on and on and on. The highlight of the night though were the 10 seconds that Jennifer Huson, Fantasia and La Toya London had when they 'sang' together for a brief moment. I must admit that that brought a smile to my face. Something else that stuck out in my mind was when Diana Degarmo, Fantasia Barino, Kelly Clarson and Ruben Studdard all performed together; that was a great sight to behold and listen to. However the solo performances of the two previous winners were... Not good. I myself am a huge fan of Kellys, but her piano version of "Beautiful Disaster" didn't have the same "WOW" that it does on her album, "Thankful". I don't think that that song was really for piano.   But eventually Ryan got to the results and Fantasia was named. Sympathy? Because of her situation as a single mother? I have a feeling she won't be seeing her daughter for about a week due to the press and then starting work on the album. I'd buy it if she had a duet with La Toya. Or Diana. Perhaps I'll buy Diana's album just to spite my parents; they  hate  her. But, as I said, I wanted her to win. The second like she sand "I Beleive" (last night), it was AMAZING! Then Fantasia comes back with "Dreams" and it's like woah, baby. Alright? Apparently the vote was close... About a percent between the winner and runner-up.  I think this afternoon my TV will be turned to FOX, while I watch On Air with Ryan Seacrest. Maybe they'll have something intelligent to say. Doubt it. It is Ryan afterall. And now that sweeps is over (ended officially last night...), all I have to look forward to is the summer season. Filled with reality show goodness, hurrah.   Let's dive into summer!
