From time to time I will post a Darwin Award winner or nominee that particularly stood out to me.  Today's focus is on a Darwin Award nominee from 1994. He believed he was a "psychic" and he decided to stop a train with his mind powers.  Click  urlLink here  for the story.    UPDATE:  I just realized that I posted the wrong link to the story.  It should be fixed now.
