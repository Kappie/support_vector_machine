And if it doesn't win Best Picture, the academy will have admitted to being the stuck up snobs that they are.  Remember Michael Moore?  He made a few nasty remarks about President Bush?  Some people booed him, some clapped.  Fine.  Did you hear what he said afterwards?  Something along the lines of: Most of the people who booed where in the balcony.  What does that mean?  The balcony holds the common folk, the non movie stars.  So now we know what Hollywood's opinion of us REALLY is.
