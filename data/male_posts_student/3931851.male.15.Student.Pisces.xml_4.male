I vowed to myself and told everyone else that I wouldn't get "her" back in any picture anymore. It's been working since summer school session two started. But now this!  I had a dream last night like most people did here on Earth. I don't remember what my dream was but it was a regular dream about hanging out with girls.  "She" was in it! And we hung out and fell in love.  I really need to find myself an ideal girlfriend now. What a loser, eh?
