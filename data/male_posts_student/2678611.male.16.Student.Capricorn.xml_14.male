My ridr was late like always, I was expecting my brother Ryan to pick me up, i was expecting him to be late, so all was on time. I noticed a man drinking tea and feeding his dog a cookie, this intrigued me for some reason. Checking my watch i notice Ryan is later then usual so i figure id give him a call, right when im about to call him i see his car pull up, his wife is driving, he explains Ryan was too busy to come pick me up so she had to come instead. It was another 2 hours before we got to where we were headed, I watched out along the cold landscape, as it passed me by. Cynthia (ryans wife) and I make little conversation on the ride home, a gentle rain starts hitting against the windshield.  As we put miles behind us the rain is picking up, the visibilty worsens and the night is turning into a spiraling staircase of rain drops and windy hell. I never liked the way Cynthia drove, keeping her consistant 80 mph as we barreled down the narrow highway, only about another hour to go.  This type of weather was uncustomary to this dry terrain. A coyote darts accross the highway barely missing us, we serve out of its way and back into our lane, Cynthia looks at me, close one huh? Her distraction leads to something more unpleasant as we hit a section of washed out road at 80 miles per hour, the car veers to the left sharply and it flips off the road. I woke up with the most god awful head ache ive ever experienced in my life, and im laying in about 5 inches of water.   I go to check on Cynthia and she's no where to be seen, I crawl out of the wrecked car and call for her, we mustve been thrown for about 300 feet off the road because I can't even see the highway anymore, and my cell phone is ruined from all the water.  I find disturbed earth, or atleast what i think is disturbed earth, its still raining, and im having a hard time finding where the car impacted along the ground, and i feel highly disoriented, i touch the sore spot on my head and check my hand to see that im bleeding a good amount. I call cynthias name to no avail and i start to become very worried...  Would you like to know what happens next?  Then stay updated on my blog, I may post again tonight.
