It's a website made entirely with Flash and Flash Animation and it gets updated pretty regularly, usually once a week.  I suggest you start out by clicking on the button that says "First Time Here" and then go directly to the Strong Bad E-mails.  Some of the best to start out with are the ones titled:  sibbie; dragon; guitar; lures  jigs; i love you;  and  trevor the vampire .  Make sure you have sound on the computer you're viewing it - otherwise it looks kinda silly... y'know... like little characters just kinda bouncing around on the screen... and stuff.    So.. Check it out.  I mean... y'know, I like it.
