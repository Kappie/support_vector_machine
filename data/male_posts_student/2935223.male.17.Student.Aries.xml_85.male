I wanna play FFCC more, but Kyle and Steve went back to Kyle's in the middle of the night.... bastards.   I really wish I had sumthin' to talk about, sumthin' interesting, so that people would comment. But I just can't. I have absolutely nuthin' on my mind......well, not really. Nothing really interesting that I care to talk about. I dunno.  The world is just so upside-down now. Everything that I thought was, isn't. This sounds like a type of thing for Rusty. Rusty has the amazing ability to adapt to anything, which is why he's so damn good at EVERYTHING! He can adapt to anything, I wish I had that ability.  No use getting worked up over it. My life is bareable. I think I'll deal with it.  shit.....I  totally  just had sumthin' to say....but it's gone now.   VISIT STEVE'S BLOG:  urlLink http://ikillubad.blogspot.com      That is all.
