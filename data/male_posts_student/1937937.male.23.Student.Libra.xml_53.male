I remember learning about them in class -- we went over an heuristic proof as to why they worked, and I enjoyed it, but in practice, I don't remember how to use them.  Ah, but I do remember that they are invariant under rotation!  So anyway, I also took my final today for Elizabethan Lit, which was fun.  She gave me an A on my final paper, which was exceptional: I definitely whipped that thing out of my ass while sitting at Starbucks.  Who doesn't sit at Starbucks with a laptop?  It's the latest rage.  And if only I had a T-Mobile phone, I'd be able to ... well, I don't want to go there, if you know what I mean.  Of course you don't.  Anyway, what else -- obviously, I'm just procrastinating.  Hector has called me many times today.  I told him that it was possible to read about his son on the Internet, and this struck him as fascinating.  He asked me to take a picture of the Internet and show it to him.  I love that guy.  His son is a well known artist.  The two of them don't speak (his son doesn't answer Hector's calls).  Oh, I got a call from my good old friend Billy H a few hours ago -- he's up in New York, working for an advertising firm.  He's just gotten an apartment in Brooklyn (on the good side, parallel with mid-town), and he's excited about that.  His roommate is a guy he met in London.  I'm going to be in a movie!  I'll even have a speaking role.  And yes, it's actually a real movie movie -- it's not a super release type thing that is expected to actually earn a lot of money, but I think it's going to be in theaters.  More details later.  Also, I'm going to Greece for the Olympics.  That's very exciting news -- I think I'll be going for about a week.  My summer session ends on August 6th.  Carissa won't be able to come with me, because her new job is going to keep her in Miami without real vacation time for about six months.  Hey, I just realized -- when I do all of these things, I can write about them.  Okay, my girlfriend is telling me to get off (she's my study alarm), so I gotta get back to work.
