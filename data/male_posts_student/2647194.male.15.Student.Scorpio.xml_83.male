Hmm...to do this lab report or not and let people suffer...  Spanish: Fridays are sometimes for movies in spanish, right? Erm, not exactly a movie, "Newsies" wasn't a film I looked forward to much. Thank God for music and cd players. Hm...I think I listened to "Whatever and Ever Amen" by Ben Folds Five, and then Led Zeppelin III.  Study hall: crammed (sort of) for that social test, and listened to more music of course.  Social: took a test which I think I got a perfect on. not too hard to do in social, but hey.  Here comes the fun part....  After school:  I raced home on the bus, only to get to the house to do some cleaning for the evening's party. Namely vacuuming the downstairs and mopping some floors. Plus I got yelled at for not walking the dogs. Keep in mind that I only had about an hour and 15 minutes to walk the dogs, vacuum, mop, shower, change, and pack up for the concert.  At about 4:40 (more like exactly), Amanda showed up so we could give her a ride to the MOA concert, and then the party afterwards. Speaking of the concert...  *Note* Mr. Shelton notified me that there was going to be a drum set there available for use THE MORNING OF THE FRICKING CONCERT! And, of course, I had spent plenty of time the night before packing up the school's drum set. Which happens to be in my car at the time. *Note*  The concert didn't go too well in my opinion. The drummer who owned the set was a f*cking asshole, and wouldn't let me use his cymbols without, "putting down 300 dollars on insurance in case you break them". HOW THE HELL AM I GOING TO BREAK CYMBOLS WITH DRUM STICKS PLAYING THEM FOR 25 MINUTES?!?! The set was pretty much a rock drum set, so the toms were really really dead-they hardly had any tone at all. The school's drum set, which I greatly prefer, was in my car at the time. And by the way, the performance right after us was a choir, so the drummer had to take down his set anyway. WE COULD HAVE USED OURS!!!!! DAMN HIM. So we ended up with a drumset that sounded like absolute shit for jazz music, 1 cymbol, and the band that the other drummer was from didn't even let us use their amps. Plus I heard the guy's comment, "I'm going to give him so much set he won't know how to use it all." The fuck I do! I think I know what I'm doing after 4 years...I had to restrain from giving the guy not one, but 2 fingers when I left. fuckers.  Needless to say, the party was quite a bit better than the concert. Even Mr. Shelton stopped by for a little while. All the people that were there:  Me (thats a given) Jamie Bob Dan Lawless Sam Matt Pat Anton Mikesh Amanda Kelly and Megan Shwartzbauer (I think I got that right) and their younger brother and parents Other random parents Ajay  There were probably more people there, but I was kinda tired so I might not remember. There were some really funny moments though:  1. The first people there (aside from Amanda and myself) were Jamie and Bob, who happened to be "lost" in front of my house. They walk inside, talking to me on the cell phone.  2. I somehow flipped a cup upright on the table once, so Bob proceeded to do that three times. I for some reason just couldn't do it again. "So, uh, are we going to watch you and Bob flip cups all night?" No, I don't think we did, Jamie.  3. "Rolling down the hill with Anton." -- Self explanatory.  4. Bob, Anton, Sam, Matt, and I all jousted and dueled with large sticks and branches, which was pretty funny. I ended up with a few cuts between doing that and wrestling Matt. Good sticks are hard to find.  5. Jamie yells out "There's only one slice of pizza left!" from the top of the hill, so all of us guys sprinted up. I passed everyone except Bob, who got a pretty good lead. Oh yeah, and about that pizza: we were at first going to have frozen pizza, because my mom didn't want to spend the money to order out. Thankfully my dad had a little bit of sense in him and ordered some Pizza hut stuff. btw...God did want us to have ordered-out pizza (lol, inside joke).  6. Bob sneezes and gets pizza up his nose.  7. A not so great moment: my mom had to be down by the fire with all of us (yes, we had a bonfire), since it was windy and dry. The grass almost caught fire too, and we hadn't had a fire in that pit for probably over a year and a half.  8. Matt, Pat, Sam, Mikesh, Anton, Ajay, and I all played "Bloody Murder". Come to think of it, it wasn't all that fun. It was a little cold, and I probably should have been down at the fire. Although I have to admit, running down the hill, tripping over the hose, rolling on my back and landing on my feet was pretty fun.  9. Matt, Pat, Mikesh, Anton, and Ajay all had a bit too much fun on my drum set. The cops could have been called.  10. At around 10, lotsa people got a little tired. I was exhausted-the week really drained me, and Amanda was the only other person there as tired as I was.  Come 11:00, I was still up, just wandering aimlessly around the house (lol). Finally at about 12:30 I decided to sleep, so I crashed until noon Saturday. I feel sorry for those who had to get up for Chops Saturday.  And that brings me to Saturday:  Pretty uneventful until about 5:00, when I went up to the Y/teen center. I shot pool until 7:00, which was when I changed into my suit for the gala at Central Park. I left my music at school (which was locked) so I had to borrow it from another member of the choir.  Speaking of the gala performances:  1. A really really horrible, I mean absolutely distasteful rendition of our national anthem. *cringes*  2. The second performance I really didn't like was the Woodbury Dance center's performance to some stupid disco-dance music. Also, the outfits had small skirts with glittering tops, and golden pom-poms. Not fitting for an expensive Gala raising money for a piano for Central Park. Keep in mind these were probably 9 and 10 year old girls. Definately not fitting with the Baroque atmosphere.  After all that I went back to the teen center, and found out that wearing a suit doesn't really affect how you shoot pool. Like it would anyway...  I considered gonig to the Underground for an hour, but it wouldn't be that fun, as I was tired, and I didn't know if anyone notable besides Drew would be there for certain. Instead I practiced music, played scrabble over a cup o' tea, and laughed hysterically at how horrible the board was. It was horrendous-nowhere to build off of, and my dad's to blame. Needless to say, I lost by a sound 41 points.  No SNL last night, since I had to get up at 7:30 for church this morning. I actually looked forward to church more than other weeks today, as it was service sunday. I know, I don't often include much religious stuff in here, but today was different. I volunteered at the Walker Methodist nursing home for getting the seniors (by that I mean 80 and 90 year olds in wheel chairs) to and from their church service. To be honest, it didn't sound like much fun at first, but it is. You really get the feeling that you made a difference in their lives, which are pretty uniform most of the time. Its a bigger responsibility than you think, and they really do appreciate it. I remember a few of them: I helped Rosa Powers to and from church, which was probably better since she didn't like the idea of change much. Clarence was a real character, and James was cool too.  It might not seem like much, but it really does change you. Specific things too. I assisted Lucy in getting to church (not just down a few ramps-its going through the whole building, elevators, etc.), and after she was situated in the church she thanked me and said "God bless you". Again, its not much, but coming from an elderly person that you really don't know all that well is, well, you feel closer to God.  lol, so yeah, I had a really good day so far. Other than that, there's not a whole lot much else, except me avoiding homework. This weather's beautiful too...I wish more days could be like this.
