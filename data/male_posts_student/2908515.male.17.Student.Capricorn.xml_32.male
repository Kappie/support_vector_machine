At 9:00 PM.  And I was positive (or at least hoping so) that the shows opening day were all sold out.  So that I didn't have to see such a horrid movie.  But one show was not sold out!  YES.  One show.  At 10:30.  So we had to wait until 10:30 when we arrived at about 9:15 PM.  It was so boring.  And dumb.  I hate going to see the movies at night.  Because thats when people go on dates.  And people on dates have the one thing I don't; a date.  So I usually avoid seeing movies at night.  I usually see movies during the day.  When there's only old people and bored people.  Which is me.  Kinda.  So anyway, here I was with my family trying not to look related to them.  And complaining.  I know I shouldn't have complained because I wanted to be on their good side.  I know I should have kept my mouth shut and smiled.  Better to not say anything than to say something, right?  But I just couldn't help it.  Its my character to speak out.  Which pissed my parents off.  A lot.  At the last moment, I just clamped my mouth down.  Fine.  I will like this movie.  I will.  The movie wasn't that good.  I don't have much interest in comic-to-big screen movies at all.  I don't have much interest in comics in the first place.  Except for the Sunday Comics.  Anyway.  My mind was elswhere the whole movie.  But I do have to say that Tobey Mcguire is one good looking guy.  I just melt with his smile.  Its so happy and boyish.  Like he's geniunely happy.  Nothing could take his happiness away.  And its good that he has a nice body to go with it.  (shallow-ness is over)  This morning was better.  I think my mom was a bit pissed off at me this morning still.  But I guess I used my personality and talking skills to calm her down.  Today we went to Philadelphia.  Which is semi-fun.  I hate my weak stomach.  I had a stomach ache the whole morning.  I think its partly due to my semi-lactose intolerance.  Whatever.  We had lunch in a resturant.  I find it nice that I can recognize people there.  And they recognize me.  Well, more so my father.  Connections, baby.  We then went on a quest to buy some incenses.  Or however you spell that.  We went to this supermarket on Washington Blvd.  My father and I spent some time looking at the music they had for sale in a small shop that was part of the whole supermarket.  That was fun.  My father and I were watching a Karoke video of some chinese singer.  It was cool that it both had chinese characters and vietnamese words on it.  I guess it was a dual language thing.  Which I thought was cool.  And the music wasn't that bad.  I was also looking at some knick knacks that I could get for Matt but decided not to.  It wasn't worth it.    When we were leaving, my mom said that if I wanted those small knick knacks I should go to California.  It would be cheaper and the stuff there is better.  So I asked her if I can go to California since she had expressed that in the past I would be able to go on the plane alone and junk.  Which would be awesome.  My mom totally said that that scenario is possible.  But I would have to travel with my brothers which isn't the worst thing in the world.  I would live with my aunts.  That too isn't the worst thing in the world.  And I would have access to a lot of the sources of my little knick knacks.  Which is cool.  And plus, its traveling.  Its something to do.  I hope I do get to go.  It is so boring here.  What else?  Hmm...I think the 75% tuition to Uni of Penn is something of a dream now.  Like its probably not going to happen.  Since my mom would have to work there for three years before the promise came into effect.  Which sucks because I would have been so happy to go to the Uni of Penn.  It's a huge dissappointment.  A really big dissappointment.  If I got in anyway.  Hmm...maybe I can visit Hawaii when I'm in California.  I have family there too.  That would be cool.  That's about it.  I'm getting ready to go to violin lessons with Laskey.  6:30.  I have plenty of time.  Doing what?  Sigh.
