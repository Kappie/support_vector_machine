So much more when asked to express my opinion to the entire class? Having thought over this issue carefully, I, sad to say still have not come up with a satisfactory answer. When I stood in front of the class, the first thing that came rushing into my mind was, “How am I supposed to make my answer  unconventional ?” I thought and thought but nothing not even suggestions from fellow classmates could do the trick. This ranged from, “Marriage is the legal consent to have carnal knowledge of someone,” to “Marriage equals to free sex.” In a nutshell, this boils down to a naughty three – letter word – sex. Indeed in this more conservative Asian society of ours, sex is seldom an appropriate topic at the dinner table. However, to equate marriage to sex does seem to be a rather flawed equation. I’m sure that by reading the aforementioned opinions from  well – meaning  friends, one would doubt the company I mix with. However, before you present the verdict, lets be honest. At the tender age of fifteen, which hot – blooded male would resist the thought of sex; much less a lifetime of free sex? In comparism, if such a question was to be answered by the opposite sex, I’m sure the response given would have been entirely different. This might (I’m just guessing) range from, “ A sense of security,” to “everlasting love.” Honestly speaking, which girls wouldn’t want to dwell in such a fantasy, which is seldom possible in this fickle, demanding world? Having explored the possible responses from both genders, one would come to a conclusion that the meaning of marriage goes beyond moral issues but to fundamental ones like the biological make up of men and women alike. I do not claim to be an expert in this area but as far as I’m concerned, men being more  primitive , will definitely wish to satisfy basic needs before moving on to more complex needs and wants which require greater intellect which is why some men stop at brothels having barely satisfied their basic needs. Women, on the other hand are more sentimental. Apparently, this includes their basic instinct. I mean, it’s the way the human body is designed – do first, talk later. Which is why women would rather be loved emotionally than to have it expressed physically. However, this cannot be said for all women where there are exceptions of women leaving a marriage because the men cannot satisfy their basic needs. Then again, the same can be said for men where the few exceptions also wish to be loved emotionally and the physical aspect need not necessarily come into the picture. My purpose of writing this article isn’t to find the meaning of marriage but to discuss its effectiveness as an ‘O’ level examination question. Indeed this was Tuesday’s ‘O’ level English oral examination question. I believe that the purpose of the GCE ‘O’ level examinations is meant to test the proficiency of students in various areas of study. However, such a question when probed further goes beyond superficial issues like sex. It requires much thinking before answering not because it takes time to find a satisfactory answer which the examiner will appreciate but also to see if it conflicts with ones beliefs. Being a Christian by faith, I find it hard to provide an  unconventional  answer for such a question. In fact, to come up with a  decent  answer would prove to be a difficult task what more unconventional one! As a Christian, there are many  laws  so to say governing marriage. It is seen as a sacred process, which every Christian should go through only once in a lifetime. Which is why providing answers relating to ‘one night stands’ and answers of similar nature would not be right. On the contrary, it is stated that men and women are made for each other but to the extent of free sex? That might be testing the limits. I do realize that what I mention here seems to be rather contradictory with regard to my actions. However, one must realize that what I say outside does not go to the point of conflicting with my faith. No matter how ‘ out of bounds’  my statements may have been, one must realize that it only flirts around the surface, teasing it lightly and that is all. But to answer such a question, even at the best of my ability, my response is as follows. Marriage is the unity of two imperfect humans who regardless of their genders, can live together in harmony and accommodate each other’s flaws and appreciate them for who they are and not what they are or what they can provide. Marriage is more than an act of love but also a lifetime commitment. In the event of either party being unfaithful, instead of walking the easier route of divorcing, they should take the difficult but permanent route, which should involve professional counseling for both parties and the support of their families. Marriage is another stage in life, which further emphasizes the need for compromise. On a larger scale, this can be put to practice between countries where compromise amongst the parities involved can prevent conflict, which might lead to war. Therefore, marriage is not just an act of love but also a valuable lesson in life. Now, even as a Christian, I must occasionally  forget  myself and therefore the other type of response which if I don’t make mention of, I would certainly live to regret. When two humans in the heat of the moment tie the knot, this is called a shot – gun marriage. Superstars who include Britney Spears have acted out such scenarios. Of course when such an unfortunate incident arises, it will definitely lead to a divorce. However, there is a way around this. It is known as a one – nightstand for the fickle minded and a long – time (platonic) relationship. In both instances, the concept of legality is given a miss and this, might give the couple(s) involved a false sense of security. Whatever the case, it beats polygamy, which as you people should know is against the law. In conclusion, marriage is a must for law – breakers (committing polygamy) who want to have the best of both worlds – sex and breaking the law.     Nofing is still confused and is trying hard to learn a valuable lesson in life (compromise) without getting married. Obviously, he needs to find a balance between the secular world and his religion, which more often than not is impossible.
