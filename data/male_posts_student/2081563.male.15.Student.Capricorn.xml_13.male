One example is musicvideos.com, it became launch.com, then it became launch.yahoo.com and now its a better site, but I just don't like that is owned by Yahoo. What really frustrates me is launch UK! I liked it when it was dotmusic, it was so easy to navigate, I really liked how each staff member had their own page, I liked all the .Asp scripts (the nerd comes out). The reviews were the best part, the quality of the reviews hasn't diminished but it's the style of their site. At one point you could see reviews from a while ago, now it's just archived for a few weeks. The hands down best part was the judging it was shown like 7/9 now its colored stars and un colored ones, which usually doesn't bother me but when it get a low score or is kinda in the middle its a bit confusing.
