Hopefully I will take my theory test soon, but there is as much chance of that happening as there is of Sam actually doing an honest weeks work.   Sam is my very best friend, utterly insane, like a piece of cheese or possibly llama excrement... Love him loads, except for when I don't. He's here right now, playing Spiderman 2 for XBOX which I wholly advocate you all playing.   I'm shocked that I'm not listening to any music. Ahh, ok, Frankie Miller - Caledonia. Nice guitar solo.   Ohh, and for anyone who's interested... Claire is out of hospital and is home... Very glad of this fact. I'm currently speaking to her on MSN and she seems to be rather good all things considered.        Remind me to post up the poem she wrote... sad and depressive maybe, but I think its very beautiful.        Later,   Dxx      EDIT - Added Sam as a member to the website as a joint member. Want to see his contributions and wacky comments to my own publishings... So, beware! (19.38 - July 23 2004)
