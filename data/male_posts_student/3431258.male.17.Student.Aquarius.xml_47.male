A bit hyped, but Bungie did a great job with  Halo : Combat Evolved .  O'Donells  instrumental musics in Halo II is as good as ever!   I was suppose to work on the biology project today at home with  Mykaela , but she did'nt came. Well, she was suppose to be here at 2h30, it's 3h28 and still no news. I will work on it a bit later.   Oh! Something really cool as well. I finally got The mp3 of  Grabbag  from  Duke Nukem 3d . No big deal if it was the pc version mp3, but it's the  Nintendo 64  edition we are talking about. AWESOME!  Regards,  Zephyr
