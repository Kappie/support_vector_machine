When I got there we played Red Faction for about an hour. lol they have a bot that they made that has 100 accuracy, so when it gets a sniper rifle... that kinda sucks, BUT if it gets a Rail Gun..... thats just stoopid, because the Rail Gun can shoot through the walls. They also made a guy that has max life and max damage amplifier... so it can almost kill you in one hit with a pistol, and the only way I can kill him is with a grenade launcher. :s    Yeah, well... after we did all that Wes wanted to show me his Neopets account (I so didn't care) and he has all these "super rare" items.... so I walked away and went into Bret's room. Me and Bret "watched" the X vol. 1 DVD that he rented, and I say "watched" because I really wasn't paying attention to what was happening. Then Wes came in and we watched my S-cry-ed vol. 1 DVD... Wes went "Ha" and I went "Ha" and then it was about 6:00. Wes' Mom made some food, sausages, potatoes, and spaghetti noodles. Wes went "gobble" and then I went "gobble". Wes continued to play the game that he rented, Tales of Symphonia, which I thought was kind of a funny game from what I saw. Apparently you can get a bunch of different rank titles and the first one Wes got was "Klutz" and later he got "Combo Newbie". Just before I left Bret made me eat a brownie with an attempted face made out of whipped cream. So I ate the brownie and left as fast as I could.    Ummm.... everything from then till now is kind of a blank.... :p k byez
