I need to spend time on my recreation like playing computer games the whole day, reading the newspapers, socialising with my ex-classmates as well as my friends, spending time with family, etc... it just goes on and on. I need to learn ASP programming for my next semester project, I need to fully utilise my oven to bake edible stuff that doesn't look black, but before that, I need to do some supermarketing, research on the internet and library for the recipe.  Look, I am so busy. So it's good that you guys don't piss me off, but actually I hope I really do get it. But on the otherhand, I still want peace and luckily you guys didn't piss me off which I wanted it so badly. Do you get what I mean? I doubt so. For now I am gonna create 2 more blogs using the same account and I am seeking for any comments from you guys.  I am going to create a blog that lists out restaurants only in Singapore that serve not only good food, have the romantic ambience, beautiful surroundings and nice environment. In this blog, I will give my review as well as ratings on those restaurants. Essential details such as the address, opening hours and I think most importantly the price in the food menu will be shown there. Those are what helpful information that diners will usually look out for, so fret not. Now with this so-called "new service" in that blog, you will never have to crack your head again for an ideal place to dine in.  The second blog would be a blog that spots good readable blogs on the world wide web, its aim is to create awearness of such great blogs and recognition. Whether the blogs are hilarious, entertaining, informative, interesting or educational, they are welcome! As long as it's in English, understandable, readable, presentable and good standard English would be a plus! As usual, review and ratings will be given to indicate the worthiness of visiting such a blog.  So what do you think? Do you agree that I should set up this two blogs? I shouldn't have asked this question because I am gonna set up no matter how violent your objection is. Now I need your help in thinking of a suitable URL blog name for these two blogs, leave your comments in this post. Thank you!  I need to sleep now...
