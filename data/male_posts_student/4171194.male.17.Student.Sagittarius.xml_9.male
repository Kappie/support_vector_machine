Euhh... that's the last thing i want.. seeing my character as an ugly fat black dude in a game"  As opposed to being a ugly, skinny, brown dude in real life? xD   In response to  "well, come on y cant rockstar let us to create our own character before we play.. so we can choose whether we want to be black.. chings.. white trash.. pakis.. italian.. or arabs"  Well they could do that, but it would make the voice acting and such harder. If you don't mind your character not talking, then sure, hey, why not make your own? But with GTA: VC Tommy Vercetti had a voice, and it was a sexy one. And don't even think about adding voices for all those races, it would be too hard. And it would take up even more space, space that I honestly don't think there is. (Note: GTA SA runs on a dual layered dvd disc, unlike it's elders)   In response to  "it gonna be more fun if rockstar can also allow us to choose our own sex.. whether we want to be a male, a female, or both :P"  Ummm, how would that lend to the gameplay? Pick a female and you can whore yourself perhaps? Or even as a man you could sell your body. And I'm not going to say ANYTHING about the both comment.  (I don't know, I think it would be kinda cool xD -Alec)    In response to  "it's gonna be cool to play as a sexy seductive dangerous blood-thirst chineese whore. :P (my fantasy)"  ... I can't give you that fantasy, but I can give you something pretty close. A Japanese (the country near China) review of female vampires (blood thirsty!) and the girl with the brown hair in the first pic doesn't look half bad.
