I contacted you independently of our investigation andno one is informedof this communication. I would like to intimate youwith certain facts that I believe would be of interestto you.In 2000, the subject matter; came to our bankto engage in business discussions with our privatebanking division. He informed us that he had afinancial portfolio of Thirty million united statesdollars,which hewished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.Iwas the  officer assigned to his case, I madenumerous suggestions in line with my duties as thede-facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the volume offunds he wished to put into our bank. We met onnumerous occasions prior to any investments beingplaced. I encouraged him to consider various growthfunds with prime ratings.  The favored route in my advise to customers is tostart by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and2000 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, We spunthe money around various opportunities and made attractive margins forour first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood atthis point at over ten million United States Dollars, this margin was not thefull potential of the fund but he desired low riskguaranteed returns on investments.  In mid 2001, he asked that the money be liquidatedbecause he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments inhere in the united kingdom. He directed that I liquidate the funds anddeposit it with a security firm. I informed him that SMITH  WILLIAMSONwould have to make special arrangements to have this done and in ordernot to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deductionfrom the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He complainedabout the charges but later came around when I explained to him thecomplexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across boarders hasbecome especially strict since the incidents of 9/11.  I contacted myaffiliate and made the fundsavailable to the security firm. I undertook all theprocesses and made sure I followed his preciseinstructions to the letter and had the funds depositedwith the security firm. The Security Firmis a specialist private firm that accepts depositsfrom high net worth individuals and blue chipcorporations that handle valuable products orundertake transactions that need immediate access tocash. This small and highly private organization isfamiliar especially to the highly placed andwell-connected organizations. In line withinstructions, the money was deposited with thesecurity firm.The deceased told me he wanted themoney there in anticipation of his arrival from Norwaylater that week.  This was the last communication wehad, this transpired around 25th February 2003.In Junelast year, we got a call from the security firminforming us that the inactivity of that particularportfolio.  This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the privatebanking sector I was the only one who knew about thedeposit at the security firm, and I could notunderstand  why the deceased had not come forward toclaim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate thedeceased. I immediately passed the task of locatinghim to the internal investigations department of SMITH WILLIAMSON.Four days later, information started to trickle in,apparently our client was dead. A person who suitedhis description was declared dead of a heart attack inCanne, South of France.  We were soon enough able to identify the body andcause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched aninvestigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation andalso to come forward to claim his estate. If you arefamiliar with private banking affairs, those whopatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, butalso some levels of detachment from conventionalprocesses. In his bio-data form, he listed no next ofkin. In the field of private banking, opening anaccount with us means no one will know of itsexistence, accounts are rarely held under a name;depositors use numbers and codes to make the accountsanonymous.  This bank also gives the choice to depositors ofhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that thereare no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next ofkin. Private banking clients apart from not nominatingnext of kin also usually in most cases leave wills inour care, in this case; the deceased died without atestate. In line with our internal processes foraccount holders who have passed away, we institutedour own investigations in good faith to determine whoshould have right to claim the estate. Thisinvestigation has for the past months been unfruitful.We have scanned every continent and used our privateinvestigation affiliate companies to get to the rootof the problem. It is this investigation that resultedin my being furnished with your details as a possiblerelative of the deceased.  My official capacitydictates that I am the only party to supervise theinvestigation and the only party to receive theresults of the investigation. What thismeans, you being the last batch of names we haveconsidered, is that our dear late fellow died with noknown or identifiable family member. This leaves me asthe only person with the full picture of what theprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit andthe late beneficiary of the deposit.  According to practice, The Security Firm will bythe end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements ofclaim to SMITH  WILLIAMSON,failing to receive viableclaims theywill most probably  revert the deposit back to SMITH  will result in the money entering the SMITH WILLIAMSONaccounting  system and the portfolio will be out of myhands and out of the private banking division. Thiswill not happen if I have my way.What I wish to relateto you will smack of unethical practice but I want youto understand something. It is only an outsider to thebanking world who finds the internal politics of thebanking world aberrational.  The world of privatebanking especially is fraught with huge rewards forthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certainportfolios. You should have begun by now to  puttogether the general direction of what I propose.There is  Thirty million dollars deposited in a security firm, I alone havethe deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct themto do so. I alone know of the existence of thisdeposit for as far as SMITH  WILLIAMSON is concerned,thetransaction with our late customer concluded when Isent the funds to the security firm, alloutstanding interactions in relation to the file arejust customer services and due process. The securityFirmhas no single idea of what's the historyor nature of the deposit. They are simply awaitinginstructions to release the deposit to any party thatcomes forward. This is the situation. This bank hasspent great amounts of money trying to track thisman's family; they have investigated for months andhave found no family.  The investigation has come to an end.  My proposal; you share the same surname With our lateclient; I am prepared to place you in a position toinstruct The security Firm to release thedeposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit,I am prepared to share themoney with you in half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the nextof kin and have them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds  be released to me, but thatwould have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming thedeposit. But on the other hand, you with the same very name as theoriginal depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary  with right to claim. Iassure you that I could have the deposit released toyou within a few days. I will simply inform the bankof the final closing of the file relating to thedeceased I will then officially communicate withThe Security Firm and instruct them to releasethe deposit to you. With these two things: all isdone.  The alternative would be for us to have The SecurityFirmdirect the funds to another bank withyou as account holder. This way there will be no needfor you to think of receiving the money from The Security Company. We can fine-tune this basedon our interactions.  I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I askthat if you find no interest in this project that you shoulddiscard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictiveand destructive. If my offer is of no appeal toyou,delete this message and forget I ever contactedyou. Do not destroy my career because you do notapprove of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sumsout of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I amnot a criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, thismay be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industrydictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in alifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself intotal control of my destiny. These chances wont pass me by. I ask that youdo not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know andlet me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man andthis is an opportunity to provide them with newopportunities.  There is a reward for this project andit is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I havehere is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I amthe only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed youwith a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life.Lets share the blessing.If you find yourself able towork with me, contact me through this emailaccount   urlLink roland_anderson7@coolkiwi.com    If you givemepositive signals, I willinitiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish toinform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowingyou and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting methrough my official phone lines nor do I want youcontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide foryou and also through this email address. I do not want any directlink between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they areperiodically monitored to assess our level of customercare in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.Please observe this instruction religiously. Please,again, note I am a family man, I have a wife andchildren. I send you this mail not without a measureof fear as to what the consequences, but I know withinme that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter ofgold. This is the one truth I have learned from my privatebanking clients. Do not betray my confidence.  Kindly send your response to my private email address  I await your response.  Roland Anderson.
