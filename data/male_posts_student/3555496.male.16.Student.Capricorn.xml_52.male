Go set these bricks up! Aaah! Do it now! Because I'm crazy! Aaah!"  so i'm like whatever and i do it to get the guy off my back.  so then chris johnson  co. swing by and he's all like,  "Hey man, I bought an crapload of fireworks, come check them out later man!"  then he asks me for an empty water bottle, and i'm like WTF? so i tell him no and he leaves.  so after i'm through working he comes around again. this time matt comes out and he's like,  "Let's go!"  and i'm all  "NO!"  so he's like see you later and they leave. so then my 'rents are all asking me why i didn't want to go and i just told them i didn't feel like it and they said that's why i don't have friends. so they give me the guilt trip until i finally get the keys and head on over to his house.  on the way i'm pretty pissed cus my rage against the machine cd won't play in the fucking radio. so i turn on thorne dr. and stomp down on the gas; it was pretty funny. so i finally get to his 'hood and eventually to his house and i see that fat tuba guy from band standing in his front yard.  so i park the car and i go up to him and ask  "What's up?"  and he's like,  "Chris and some other guy were making fireworks and one exploded and him and the other guy are all burned, like 2nd degree burns, I'm waiting out here for the ambulance."  just then mike comes up and we're all standing around. so we finally go inside and chris is like all red and that other dude is on the couch like screaming. so i'm thinking that i need to bail, and i need to bail fast.  and like clockwork the constable and the ambulance team show up. so everyone in the house gets rounded up in his backyard and  The Man 's all like,  "Okay, I don't need any shit-stupid stories. What the hell happened here?"  so me and mike don't even know what to say, so we stay out of it. then gerold the tuba guy tells him they were making bombs out of ozarka bottles. so he's all like,  "Okay, you all need to get some parents up here. Now."   then  The Man  calls the  ARSON INVESTIGATOR .  so by now i'm pretty pissed i'm there cus i have nothing to do with anything. aften like two hours sitting on chris' back deck getting bitten by mosquitoes, they finally let us go. so i walk out and there's like a news crew and my 'rents and the arson investigator. so he lets everyone know that  we're all convicted of being accomplices to arson , and that we need to come to his office this week and give a written statement to prove otherwise. so i'm like,   "Kiss my ass, Johnny Q. Law! "Okay sir, I'll be there."  and my 'rents are all like sorry for forcing me off my ass and i'm like,  "WHATEVA!" "It's okay. No problem."   so i get my ass in the car i'm not even supposed to be driving without my license and take off. i get home, i launch some firecrackers, i put out some fires, i sweep up my mess, i come in, i eat, and here i am.  this has been one helluva day.
