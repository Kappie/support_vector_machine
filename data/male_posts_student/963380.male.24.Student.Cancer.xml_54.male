The tints make it look like a sexmobile though, which may be a bit offputting for some :)  I'm up far too late for when I have to be up in the morning. I should be catching some major z's right now, but as usual, I don't know what's good for myself... well I do, but I ignore me. Nothing quite like that voice of reason that you ignore over and over. So work's been a general bust lately. Can't say it's good having more people on staff, cause it just plain isn't. Steve hired two more guys to work with us, one for the floor and one for upgrades. It's just plain overkill, kinda like using one of those Daisy cutters on the poor bastards in Afghanistan. Gets the job done I suppose. I had a bit of a run in with Jerry a few days ago. Dude stepped in front of me as I was approaching a customer. I totally wanted to kill him. He actually sped up to get in front of me. I can't believe anyone would do that, at least not in our environment.  So aside from him being an utter dingus - the fact that Christmas seems to have been hijacked by Al Queda (bet that line got a few stares from the NSA webbots) really sucks. No one is out spending the copious amounts of money they should be. It's going to be a lean few months for some in January if this doesn't pick up.  I get the auto start and the radio installed in my new car on December 17th. Apparently the friend of mine who fixed my exhaust not too long ago managed to get an appointment - but it had to be for 8 hours of labour!! Stupid Malibu! In the meantime, I get to freeze my butt off everytime I get into my car. Meh.  Band of Brothers keeps getting better in quality as the war gets worse in nature. It was sad to see Lt. Hawk go (Buck Compton) but we knew it was coming. I just hope the chap from Office Space makes it through. It's a bit weird to be rooting for guys you know won the war - and knowing that they may not come out alive. It's hurts a little. It's just TV though. I'm suprised I get such an intense feeling from TV, but it's remarkably well done. I wish we had HBO up here in Canada, I'd purchase it just to support them.  On that note, why do Canadian television series generally hurt so badly? It's not like we don't throw a lot of money at them. Sonja Smits must be getting really tired of being part of failed series... poor lass was in traders when it died, and now the 11th hour is barely out of the gate and already in the stages of a coronary. I remember that series about a news network that had the gay producer - they killed that off too... The 11th hour looks to be more of the broadcast side, but so far the stories have been a bit weak.  I'm going to try to sink my teeth into 24 in the next little while. Bought the set on DVD and I haven't even touched it yet. I really have to start reclaiming my time. It kind of blathers away on me. DVD is a real problem - so many series, so little time. Star Trek is the worst offender. three series in like three weeks with them. gah.  Deep space nine is coming out on DVD in January - it has to be possibly the ugliest DVD case I've ever seen in my life. Pink just doesn't do Terok Nor justice.  So, when I got my car, no less than five minutes off the lot, some bastard tried to reverse himself into me to get himself out of the way of the truck. God only help him if he had have hit me. I laid on my cheap japanese weenie horn until he gave me the finger. Motherfucker stopped though. The past couple days have been slightly harrowing as I've been paranoid about everything that has come within 10ft of me.  Jim and Andrew and I are thinking about maybe starting a website selling car modifications - nothing cheesy like riceboy shit, but classy addons. We're going to sit down on Tuesday and try to hammer some details out...
