Pictures of well-endowed scantily-clad models whoclaim to be satisfied customers ....... create a need, in both female reader who are "unhappy with their bust" and, possibly, their partners.  * As a woman, I would like to address the salons' definition of sexiness, attractiveness and the other "-nesses" that have to do with beauty.   The worth and value of a woman are not and should not be measured by the size of her breasts  or any other part of her anatomy.  A woman has much beauty to celebrate : her life and identity, the vital roles she plays in the domestic setting and the workplace, the contributions she has made in various arenas through the years. her creative energies manifested in her writing, and the power in her voice which can still be both a crying baby and a raging sea, among other.  Therefore,  every woman is beautiful and worthy , with or without bigger and firmer breasts. Beauty salons should not try to define us by relegating us to the rank of mere sexual visuals.
