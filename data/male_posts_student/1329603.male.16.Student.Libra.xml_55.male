I feel a bit guilty and a bit that I've undermined my position. I'm not sure why but for some reason I'm worried about Sam. I just want confirmation that she still exists, that's all. Grr, it's all because of the weather on Friday, that being that it was really foreboding and incredibly dark, but it didn't rain at all and there was only light wind. I deliberately went to choir, got there 15 minutes late, to find Sam wasn't there. That sparked this. Hooray.  Oh, and on the subject of the choir, I'm making a choir website. Hooray! It should be up soon enough, I hope. I'm using different shades of blue, given that blue is the colour associated with Mary. I'm finding it difficult to locate any internet pics of St. Mary's though, I'll probably have to take them myself.  OH! And I may have posted this already but mum got the K-1000 fixed (a very valuable kind of camera) and I've been using it to try and see what the filters do. I'm just running this coloured film and then I'm going to put a black and white one in and take some pictures (probably of Zoe, she said she would so I'll hold her to it ^_^) so hooray! I'll take a few pictures of the church in a bit.  The traces of the Evesham bush have all but vanished from my hand. Hoorah!  When it's finished, the choir subdomain will be  here .  Love, Jon Roskilly
