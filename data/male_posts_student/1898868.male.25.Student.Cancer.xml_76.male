Bagel, on the other hand, is guided by societal norms and his quest for prestige. Berkeley is therefore nota good fit.  Duke, on the other hand, would be nearly ideal. Bagel could be the "Sixth Man". Coach K would be his coach. He could eat at the Loop every single day. He could hang out with the Captain (Bert) on weekends.And all incoming freshman now get free ipods.
