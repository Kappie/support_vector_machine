It really is too bad that Dean isn't viable, as he would have provided the most entertainment.  Now that Lieberman has withdrawn, the field is lacking anything resembling a decent human being.    You might be seeing polls that show Kerry beating Bush, but those are laughable at this point.  The electorate doesn't even know Kerry yet, and they are responding to two months of favorable press, plus the natural desire to associate themselves with a 'winner'.  When Bush actually stirs himself to campaign, his staff will present Kerry on a platter.  I don't think it's going to be close on election day, but the media will pump up Kerry's chances until the last moment.  That brings me back to Bush and my anger.  I've decided I will not vote for him unless the election really is close.  I can't bring myself to reward the spending.  I want him to win, since it is vital that we be resolute in the face of terror, but I just can't bring myself to give him my vote.  I will vote libertarian, even though that party will never have a chance in hell of ever winning a national office (since they nominate crackpots).  Much like Al Sharpton gathering delegates to build a small base of power, I'll throw my lot in with the Libertarians in an effort to try to attract the attention of the true conservatives in the GOP.
