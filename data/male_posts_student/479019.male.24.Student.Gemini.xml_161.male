That's probably the reason why we didn't finish again! I had double the amount of people too! It also had to do with the little BBQ I had in my backyard. All the burgers and hotdogs took up valuable stomach space. But it was a cool little party. About 20 of my very good friends sitting around eating, drinking, and watching movies.   Today I just relaxed all day and did nothing. So it was a good weekend. Now I get to look forward to a week of working at 8 AM.  ***
