He has blondish brown hair, greenish-blue eyes, and a very hairy dad.  I love it when he does the robot, and we celebrate goals together.  We always pass before the games, and he got mad at me one time because I didn't talk to him after Miranatha.  I had to apologize to his mom and hug his dad. I was sad.  Anyway, now we're good friends, even though sometimes we don't get along.  I can never really think of one time where we didn't get along, but If I do I'll put it on here.  All of this stuff is a great friend huh?  Well guess what, this person is Adam Johnson!  Love ya Anderson.   That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
