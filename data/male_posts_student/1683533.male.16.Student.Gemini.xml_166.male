The video was synced with the music and there were several special effects used: illusion of the same person being in the shot at the same time, slow motion, fast motion, backwards...and everything fit in perfectly.  My favorite part was when me and marty battled on the merry-go-round, and I think Nick set it so it played twice as fast so it looked even better.   You all can buy a DVD for like 7 bucks, and I suggest you do it.  I am really into the Sopranos, I'm on the 3rd season now.  But one of the last episodes just disturbed me.  Ok, so Tony (main character, pretty much head of the mafia) has a therapist and she gets raped, and they show it, and this is an HBO series so they really show it.  It was revolting.  Then to make things worse the fucker gets out of it after being caught because of some technicality.  So she is at a fast food place and sees the rapist's picture as the employee of the month.  Then she gets this dream.  She gets her hand stuck in a vending machine, and a rottweiler is there and she thinks its gonna hurt her.  then the rapist shows up in the dream and starts touching her and the rottwieler jumps on him instead of the therapist.  So, she analyzes the dream.  The vending machine is her guilt for parking in a empty shady-looking parking garage and not gettin escorted to her car, she is is "caught" in her guilt.  The rapist...is the rapist.  The dog is Tony.  Even though he is a hostile mob guy he can actually help her.  SO, later on she meets with Tony for one of his sessions, she starts crying and Tony asks what is wrong and if there is anything he can do.  And she says No.  Then the episode ends.  I was so pissed, I really wanted the rapist to die.  It was so goddamn sick.  People are sick, this kinda shit happens everyday, I dont mean the mafia shit, but just the rape.  Seeing that, even though it was just acting, really struck something in me, but in the wrong way.  What the fuck is wrong with people.  If your that horny and lonely go to a whorehouse.  All women should be equipped with mace or kung fu, so that doesnt happen anymore.  Hell, even guys to, when they are born, strap a friggen belt on their diaper and a holster with mace on it, let them carry it around to protect themselves till they die.  No more rape goddammit.
