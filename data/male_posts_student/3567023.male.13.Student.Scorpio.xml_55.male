I was going to as a Javascript game but I was tired and really not up to it. I think that there is music so you might want to turn down the volume cause it really blares across the sound system. In case you were wondering its from Chrono Trigger (Frongs Theme). Anyway I just wanted to notify you people that my birthday is however many days away it is. I think I confused myself. Well anyway thats all for now.
