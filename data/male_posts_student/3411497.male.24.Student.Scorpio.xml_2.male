Rather, this morning, I awoke remembering not a single instant of last night's dreams, remembering only vague impressions.  As usual, I was presented with some sort of challenge, some sort of search, and as usual I succeeded only to have a new challenge, a new search, bestowed upon me.  Somehow, my dreams have fallen into some common template -- I always have to go do stuff.  Something about last night I recall: I was pursuing this kind of yellowish, marshmallowish creature that did something... and whatever it did, I had to do something about it, but even then, I don't recall knowing why, or necessarily agreeing with why it had to be done.  We're always doing things  about  something.  I can't remember the last time I've seen Americans, as a society, do something  for  something.  I think our lives are becoming far too speculative, too privileged for the present... I saw a commercial yesterday about some service called "InPhone", (or perhaps more insipidly, "InFone"), where some guy calls this service to   book a restaurant reservation for him.    Does anybody really need a middle-man to take care of that task?  How much longer before I can have somebody sent over to my house to take a nap for me?  Some things are different, and require middle-men.  Assassinations, for example, often require middle-men.  Grocery shopping requires middle-men, we can't all go to the farm, take what we want, and leave some cash in the doorstep.  In certain instances of the handicapped and elderly, driving requires a middle-man... flying almost always requires a middle-man for everybody.  Making a reservation at a local restaurant, however, does not require a middle-man.  That is a task reserved for those so "busy" that they only have time to call somebody to do something even though it would take the same amount of time to perform that task personally -- rather than calling somebody, you can call this service and have them call that person for you.  That is so fucking stupid.  I'm going to call "InFone" and ask them if they'll call "InFone" for me -- I need a reservation at Taco Bell.  I simply wish those resources, and that money, and the people that now work for and run "InFone" would dedicate their lives towards something more worthwhile.  The privileged are already privileged -- they need not more privileges.  Regardless, the entire point I'm trying to make here is that I just woke up, and I'm in a world that makes as little sense to me as the world where I was while I was asleep, chasing a yellowish-marshmallow creature for reasons that were as elusive to me then as they are now.
