Five movies and five songs de jour (in no particular order)....  1)Rushmore - This movie is one part Killa Cal....one part Joey C (a good friend and big brother I never had)....we are Max Fischer....tons of great lines....just a damn good movie....  2)The Big Lebowski - This movie is a staple in my movie diet....John Goodman is at his best here in the part he was born for....Jeff Bridges is the dude!....and the dude abides.....  3)Higher Learning - No movie has the power to make me as angry as this movie....listening to John Singleton's commentary really enhanced an already great movie....  4)The Best Man -THE movie for my generation of young, upwardly mobile Black males....now if I could just innact my plan to steal Sanaa Lathan from Omar Epps....  5)Goodfellas - The story of Henry Hill will always be my favorite....hands down, bar none....  and on to the songs.....  1)Moby featuring Gwen Stefani - Southside (remix)....I like Gwen a whole lot....I discovered No Doubt a little late....  2)Shai - The Place Where You Belong....seriously slept on R song from an underappreciated group....  3)Musiq Soulchild - Settle For My Love....I had no idea that this was a remake of a Patrice Rushen song until a few weeks ago....he really did well by it....  4)Destiny's Child - Dangerously in Love....See the thing is....these girls have never amde a good song....they have made some catchy tunes....but good music?....not before this one!  5)Radiohead - Creep....Sums up so much of how I feel most of the time....maybe I'm really a melancholy white boy stuck in the body of an out of shape 22 year old black kid....  Anyway all of this is subject to change....but it's how I feel right now....  Holla!
