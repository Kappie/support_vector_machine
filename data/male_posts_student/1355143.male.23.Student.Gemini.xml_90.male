Graduation weekend was wonderful- I had family come in from all over.  It was really sad to say goodbye to my best pals, but I guess that's life.  I have now moved from Austin back to Dallas where I'll attend medical school.  I got into my top choice school here in Dallas, so I'm pretty happy about that.  It's a four year program, and in my fourth year I'll apply for residency (specialization) programs.  I'll probably try to leave Texas for that, just to have a new experience.      I just got back from Las Vegas last night.  I went to Las Vegas to meet up with old friends and my family that lives there (I used to live in Vegas), and then we all drove to Phoenix, Arizona for our cousin's wedding anniversary party.  That part of the country is beautiful.  I had fun playing with all my baby cousins :)  Next week, I'm leaving to go to South America for a post graduation backpacking trip with three of my friends from college.  We're going to spend a month there, and travel to Brazil, Peru, and Argentina.  I'm very excited about the whole thing - it should be an adventure!   Besos,      Seema  And then Kat:  ....I haven't read the Bar Tomas blog in a long time too.  I hope you and the rest of the barcelona crew are doing well.  Well, what's going on with me...  This summer I've been interning at the state capitol with a representative.  She's the chair of the Border and International Affairs committee, and I've been doing research on Texas/Mexico border issues for the next legislative session.  It's pretty interesting, and I'm definitely learning a lot.  I don't know about a career in politics or anything, but it's nice to know that we could pass legislation that would address some of the problems there.  I'm also taking a couple summer classes, and taking it pretty easy-- hanging out with friends and my family.  My sister just graduated, one of my cousins got married, and another cousin graduated-- so lots of family stuff.    Regular classes will start back up again in August and then it will be full speed ahead until graduation (I forgot how busy things are here compared to Barcelona).  I can't believe it's my last year.  I'll be graduating in May.  After that I'm not sure what my next step is going to be.  Hopefully I'll get some job offers maybe grad school... who knows :)  I have a lot of mixed feelings I guess.  It's scary and exciting, but I'm ready for a change.    (then she replies to something I wrote)  No, I haven't been watching handball, but since you're such a sports fan, you should know that the Longhorns (My university's baseball team) are in the finals of the college world series!  It's pretty exciting!!!  So the "world series" is a bit of a misnomer... since its basically colleges in the US.  Nevertheless, it's BIG TIME!  Well, that's all I have for now.  I hope to hear from you soon :)  Katherine
