Nagging is hopeless, but there is a way to get her in gear. Now, keep in mind that this strategy only works when they are eating and you are waiting.For instance, If you really want to see Spider-Man 2 on opening night and you are worried that all the good seats will be taken, tell your female friend, girlfriend, wife, that "if she keeps on eating, she will get fat." Trust me, she will stop immediatly and you could watch your movie.  By the way, Spider-Man 2 is better than the original.   -- -- --  I can't really get over this subject. I mean, you could've walked past your future wife 5 times in Wal-mart and not even notice it. I mean, you could have gone to school with her during Pre-K. I don't know, but the possabilities  seem  endless. ITs just one wierd subject. Or maybe its just me. Maybe I think to much. I'm confusing.
