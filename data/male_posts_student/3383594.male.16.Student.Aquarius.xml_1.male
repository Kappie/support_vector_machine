I'm pretty proud of myself though, cus I dun usually spend tt much time on Chinese. L0L!  I met my Pri Sch fren at 6pm and we went to West Mall. We had dinner at Burger King and did a lot of catching up. We were basically talking about our lives and how it had changed since the last time we met. We spent like half an hour at Burger King juz relaxing and catching up. After tt, we were off to shopping!  First, we went to Giodarno. I got a pair of ankle socks there for $6, which was to my judgement, extremely expensive. Next, we went to Watsons, where I bought a L'Oreal FX Studio hair cream. It cost me $10.30!!! OMG! Well, hair products are always so damn expensive anyway, but there was a 20% discount, if not it would haf been $12.90! We proceeded to Popular next, so tt I could pick up some stationery. I juz bought a stapler and a pen. We went up to Sembangwan Music next to check out on the latest albums and stuffs, but didn't buy anything. We made our way to Bata next, also known as, Buy And Throw Away. I bought a pair of shoes there, which cost me $30.  After we came out of Bata, I realised tt the Giodarno ankle socks was gone. I had no idea if I dropped it or if some1 stole it. *Sighz* So, we went to another shop in West Mall to get ankle socks. The shop sold 1 pair of ankle socks at $1.90, which was so much cheaper. I decided to buy 2 pairs since it was so cheap. Well, like I always say, you win some and you lose some. I lost when I lost the Giodarno ankle socks, but I won when I found a shop tt sold cheaper ankle socks. So it wasn't tt bad after all. L0L! I total up my spendings for the day and it amounted to $61! OMG! L0L! But, it's alrite, even my mum agreed wif me. She said it was alrite cus I onli go shopping like once or twice a yr, so it doesn't realli matter. L0L!  *** Important Update On My Injury *** Yesterday I went to see a doc in the morning. I was realli hoping tt my injury didn't haf anything to do wif my bones. I juz didnt wan any dislocated, fractured or broken shitz. L0L! In the end, the doctor said tt it was juz the muscle, nothing serious, but it would take weeks to recover. But when he was massaging tt part tt hurts, the pain was horrible. Haha, so I realised tt if some1 was to actually squeeze tt part, it would probably hurt like hell. L0L, alrite guys, so all of you noe my conditions now. No worries, but pls try to keep your hands away frm tt painful part ya? Cya! =]
