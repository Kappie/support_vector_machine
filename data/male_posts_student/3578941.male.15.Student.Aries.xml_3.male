I even just now forgot what today was, man i love summer vacation.  Oh ya, about that thing were i am thinking about what happened the past few days, it aint gunna happen, so i will talk about today.  I woke up at like 12:15 p.m and i felt kinda sick like i was yesterday so i just got on the computer and screwed aroung for a while on the internet.  My mom got home at like 2 from this class thingy she's takin in jacksinville and at 4 we took chris to work and picked up our car from the shop and i scraped paint off of our rental house for a half'n'hour.  Now i will explain all of those things, we had to take chris to work today because apparently he got in a fight with his dad about him taking a buncha shit from him for the past few years and he was damn tired of it, so his dad said he couldn't drive, so we took him to work and he said he would try to find a ride home tonight but if he didnt he would walk home.  Now for those of you who don't know were he lives, he lives out here at the lake like close to my house, that is about 2 miles from DQ were he works.  I have had to walk home from school, which is further, and it is not that fun, it does give you a lot of time to think about things, but it is 11 o'clock at night and he might be walking home.  Now to the car, about 2 or 3 or 4 days ago the car started making some funny noise and we didnt know what they were, so my dad took the car to Knous and they fixed it...for 215 fucking dolars. o well.  Then to the rental house.  My dad is paying me and my bro $100 each to scrape the paint off of the house and then paint it, all before July 6th.  So every once in a while i go down there and scrape some paint off. and then that leads to now and a bit before now.  my brother came upstairs all pissy and wanted to know if i turned off the X-box like 5 hours ago, i said yes and then he got all pissy because he hadn't saved his game before he left for work.  Either way it would have happened because i played Halo while he was gone and if you leave the X-box on for more than 6 hours it will turn off and he found out about it like 7 hours later so i aint really feeling sorry for him.  and now i am gunna put some lyrics on here for the way i feel right now, i am also gunna do somtin different than most people and put on the tabs for the song, if you dont know what tabs are, they are a cheap way of learning a song on guitar, and yes i play guitar, i think i play well but some may beg to differ so here they are  Linkin Park-Breaking the Habit Memories consume like opening the wound  I'm picking me apart again You all assume, I'm safe here in my room Unless I try to start again  I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I know it's not alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight...  Clutching my cure, I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more, than any time before I have no options left again  I don't want to be the one the battles always choose 'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream I don't know why I instigate And say what I don't mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonightâ€¦  I'll paint it on the walls 'Cause I'm the one at fault I'll never fight again And this is how it ends  I don't know what's worth fighting for Or why I have to scream But now I have some clarity  To show you what I mean I don't know how I got this way I'll never be alright So I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit I'm breaking the habit Tonight...  e--0--5--3--2-- B-------------- G-------------- play 6x D-------------- A-------------- E--------------  e--0-----3--2--0--5--3--2-- B-----4-------------------- G-------------------------- D-------------------------- A-------------------------- E--------------------------  Verse: second guitar e----------------------------- B----------------------------- G----------------------------- D--9--9-12--9-9--9--9-10--9-9- play through out song A----------------------------- E-----------------------------  Chord names:     Em  C   Bm  D   G  D/F# e---x---x---2---2---3---2--- B---x---1---3---1---3---0--- G---x---x---4---2---4---0--- D---2---2---4---x---5---2--- A---2---3---2---0---5---3--- E---x---3---x---0---3---x---  these tabs are short because Linkin Park is more about rapping than about shredding on the guitar i am gunna go to bed pretty soon so i gunna post agian in a few days or tommorow night or when ever
