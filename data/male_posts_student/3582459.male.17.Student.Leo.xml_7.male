I went there to return a book,  The Partly Cloudy Patriot  by Sarah Vowell a few days overdue, and while there I read some newspapers.  More specifically, I read about a week's worth of  The Christian Science Monitor  (CSM), which, despite the scary sounding name, is one of the five national (secular) newspapers, the others being  The New York Times , the  Los Angeles Times ,  The Wall Street Journal , and  The Washington Post . The CSM is unique in that it's printed on tabloid size paper rather than broadsheet size paper. Tabloid is smaller than broadsheet.  In any case, the CSM continues to impress me with journalistic integrity and general goodness. It costs a dollar, but is about 30 pages long and packed with useful information. Except for the one Christian Science (which is a cult) article on the last page, all of the stories in the CSM are usually worth reading or at least skimming. In addition, articles are just the right length--long enough that they leave few unanswerwed questions, but short enough that I can read them pretty quickly.   In contrast, I'm disappointed in the print edition of  The New Republic  (TNR), a left-leaning political magazine I recently ordered. It's only 40 pages long and is printed on magazine sized paper, so it has less content than  Time  magazine. Also, the articles are far too long for me to read in one sitting--they often span several pages. They're good articles, though.  Both periodicals are used extensively in speech and debate circles for evidence.   Getting only the Friday CSM all year round costs $52, and getting 44 issues of the almost-weekly TNR costs about $40. If I had to choose one as my only news source, I'd choose the CSM. But since we get the San Jose  Mercury News , it's better for me to get TNR.   Both the CSM and TNR use a lot of good vocabulary, so if you're planning on studying for the SAT I'd recommend reading them.  The Economist  is good too.
