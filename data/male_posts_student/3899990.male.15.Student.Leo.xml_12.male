I'm going for several reasons:  1) To attend my Godmother's wedding. 2) To visit my sister. 3) To eat lots and lots and lots of Chinese Food (which you know there is pretty much NONE here unless you cook it yourself and it's not even that good if you go to one of the restaurants here).  I will be bringing my Notebook (laptop) with me so I'll try to post every now and then. I'll still be online at night... so you can still IM me if you want to. I have to leave home at 6 AM tomorrow morning, have to be at the airport at 7 AM and the flight departs at around 10:30 AM. Which means, I can't stay up that late tonight... gonna go to bed earlier so I'll have a good start for tomorrow. While I'm in LA, I'll be thinking about all of you who are in the hot valley of the sun. =) Have a great weekend!
