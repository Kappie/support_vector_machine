(as probably expected from me)  We seemed to have had a pretty good hang out today, b/c we like, did stuff, 'cept Conrad had leave early for some waste-of-time program. Got to hang out longer b/c band practice was impossible today. That kinda rocked.  In-fuckin'-credibly, I have NOTHING interesting to share. C'est hard to believe, Nescaf√©?  Well to fill up space, and push old posts out of the way, I'll just rant, b/c I do that a lot. Rant rant rant...uh, that wasn't it I hope you know.  I don't want to go to college! They keep sending me crap about it, and financial aid, and about how great the campus and student body is, and I can't stand it!!!!! I get the worst feeling of desparation through my body, I feel the extreme need to tear my eyes out, or bash my head against a wall! I'm going to lose you all! I never should have made friends. Now I'll only lose them, loose them all, and they've actually become important to me...NOTHING is important to me! And now I'll lose something I will! I can't stand to think about it, and the worst, it's decision time comin' up where I have to do all this shit to appease the colleges, SAT II's, SAT's, essays?!?!?!? WHY?! I DON'T WANT TO GO THAT BADLY, but...I also don't really want to be alone...I didn't think I'd be around this long...I didn't ever expect to have to worry about any of this...  I'M DEADINSIDE, AND I HAVE ISSUES!  "Lame-ass, complaining, emo-jerkwad!! POSER! YOU'RE A POSER! A SHAME TO PUNK AND ALL IT STOOD FOR!!"
