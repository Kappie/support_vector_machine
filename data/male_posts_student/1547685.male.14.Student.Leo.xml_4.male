AH was great again b/c mr. b can always make funny jokes during class. Spanish class was great b/c my teach has a machine that gives out air that helps you think and calm down. To tell you the truth, it smells okay but i dont think it works b/c ppl in my class are always still talking and they get crazy. English made me tired and sleepy so i have no clue what the next two chapters are about b/c i didnt hear it, woops....... Laccrosse was fun but im really bad at it for some reason. Last year i was pretty good, but now i forget the rules and cant scoop it up. Bible was fun fun fun of course and yesterday mr. merrell gave me a packet of Eclipse gun that was CHERRY flavor. Its really good but when you first try it, it tastes like medicine. I gotta go get more of this stuff and give it to my AP crew (lol). Sharks play today!!!!!!!!!!!  P.S. If you read my blog then IM me so i know its not a complete waste of time.
