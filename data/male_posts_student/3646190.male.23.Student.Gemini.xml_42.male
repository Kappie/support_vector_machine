It was sad that more Americans (including Muslims and Desis) were not at the protest.  Well enough with the complaining!  Here is something that might interest Desi readers:  urlLink Youth Solidarity Summer . I recommend Desis to check the website out. This conference is a progressive forum for young Desi radicals to share ideas and experiences so we can better organize our Desi communities. I am attending the conference this year and am excited to see the kind of work being done around the country in the Desi community.   In the future I would like to come back to Detroit (after doing some traveling) and attempt to organize the Desi community in the metro-Detroit area.  I think the main group putting on the conference is the Samar Collective. Here is their online magazine:  urlLink Samar   Here is a Desi organization in New York City:  urlLink DRUM (Desis Rising up and Moving.    ps No posts from me on Sunday or Monday because the library is closed so no access to the Internet :(
