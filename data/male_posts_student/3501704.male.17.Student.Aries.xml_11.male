The thought of the mid year exams coming in about 3 weeks time really kills the pleasure of this holiday. I havent studied and i dun plan to study till like bout 10 days before. Yeah i noe, PROCASTINATION IS SO IRRESISTIBLE, hope i dun screw up the other papers as i already missed one of the compulsory papers. Hm tomolo going back to sji to collect the ORdinary cert, hope to meet up with some of my ex-classmates, havent seen some of them in ages,,, i wanna catch a few film too
