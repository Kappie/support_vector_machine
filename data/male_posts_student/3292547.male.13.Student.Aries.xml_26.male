So bored in fact that I don't even know if I posted yesterday, so if I repeat myself of what I've already said, or mention things you have no clue about- please work with me and ask your questions below.  I'll start out with yesterday since we don't want you to get confused:  Yesterday I'm not sure what happened. More likely I don't know if there was even a yesterday. All I really remember is going out to eat after church and buying a new book called  Eye of the World  by Robert Jordan  . I'm not sure if it's good. Right now I'm thinking it's one of those cheap books that nobody buys and it just sits on the shelf. Considering it has 814 pages and it's a 9 book series, there's no telling if it'll be one of those "....on and on and on and on and on and on....." books.   While we were at Wal-MartÂ©, we also got one of those $10 games that they have. No, we aren't poor, but there was a "Sherlock Homes" one that looked good called  The Mystery of the Mummy  and I also got  Mysterious Journey , which is roughly the same thing as Myst I, II, and I think there's even a Myst III. I'd have bought it or something better, but I'm saving up my money to fix my computer up and get it up to date. It runs great, but a Gig of RAM and a 64-bit processer as well as a good video card and CD or DVD burner sound pretty good. You have to make some sacrifices.   To give you a quick update, I've gone in and made it so all the links look the same color, even if you've visited the site before, and I took off the underline. When you do put your cursor over a link, it will underline then, just to show you what it is. I thought it looked better that way, but I'm not sure.
