Woooooooo we are really really a nation addicted to sugar.  But what's more interesting: "Congress imposed a nationwide speed limit of 35 miles per hour...as a result, highway death rates dropped dramatically." WOW!!!!! Speed limit NATIONWIDE at 35 mph.......Man in today's lightning pace stressful lives......Such a speed limit would certainly kill off lots of people!!!!!!!!!!
