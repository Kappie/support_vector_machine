What do dreams actually represent? Desire? Direction? Or are dreams really merely an indication of things to come.      Yesterday's dream was particularly intriguing. The whole dream was full of action and it involved all the people whom i were close to in my life. The most interesting aspect of it was that my hands were amputated halfway throughout (why though i still do not know why) and those people started to leave one by one. Suprisingly though, in my dream i did not cry when that happened. I only smiled and laughed as the dream ploughed on and finally only ending when i woke up in cold sweat. The dream really troubled me for a portion of the morning. It made me wonder what was my subconscious mind really feeling. Lyrics from a song Gary Jules - Mad World came to my head "And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad. The dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had."      Do i really know myself and can claim to be in control of my mind. Or is there a possibility of me actually losing it. That dream really scared me as it seemed like there was a possibility indeed. Can i claim to know more then i actually know or is reality just a cruel mirror which shows nothing but voidness.          "Blatant lies are told everyday,   but your eyes seem to give the game away.   Where is truth, has it lost its way,   another broken promise, another dismay.   Where i have cried, where i have died,   i can only hope and pray to see a better day."
