(next subject) my mom is being all over-protective since one of her policy holders got hit by a car this weekend, its annoying the hell out of me cuz she brings it up everyday since it happened and she even wants me to go to the funeral, like hell if i am, not to be mean or anything, but i didnt even knw the lady, so why would i be there -_- (nextsubject) this is day 3 of me constantly listening to taking back sundays new cd, for some reason i always do this when i get a new cd but oh well.(next subject) im starting on version 2 of my site, which is awesome cuz i just learned some new flash techniques, that im going to apply to my site (next subject) well sysy played a trick on me and admitted that she was behind it yesterday (the prank was from a week ago, and it was some dude that she knew , who IMed me acting like some girl from school........gay -_-..i knew she was behind it all along tho but thats besides the point) well i told tim, and he came up with some idea that i had to tell sysy that i asked a girl out and she said yes and tim would act like the girl( i have to say it was quite funny at the beginning) i never thought the joke would actually work nor did i knw sysy was so gullable, but anywho, we carried on the joke for like 30 mins, then kevin got into it and went to find some random girl pic and acted like that was the girl tim was pretending to be knwn as "liz" then it continued for like 10-15 more mins then we all left it alone, but during the whole thing we were all wondering did she knw it was a joke, then we decided to go ahead and tell but not straight foward, but through like different little hints like how tim said "liz" last name was mattingly, which should have gave it away......................but it didnt -____- then after that i think he tried a couple more hints and then just left it alone but we still werent sure if she knew or not, ok then we all just gave up and told her, she took it way more harsh than i thought and blocked all of us then made an entry in her LJ that kevin linked me to and it said stuff about me and how mad she was and...stuff (gawd me and my no emotions) it felt like i was obligated to make a comment on it which i did saying i was sorry....and stuff, like it helped any, but she did unblock which is a plus i guess. she hates me now which i dont knw why it was just a joke, if you cant take one dont make one (as chessy as it sounds, i stand behind it) she pulled one on me, so i did one back, and im the one whos suppose to feel guilty -_-, not fair.........not fair at all.
