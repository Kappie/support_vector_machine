The older you get, the more distant you get with your family, so it was nice going up there again.   We haven't camped as a family in 2 years because of mom's surgeries. It's different now, because my parents have given a lot more trust. We saw fireworks, went into town, swim on the bay, and a lot of other shit.  Anywaystogo, i removed some of the band links, because i either don't like them, or don't listen to them anymore.  I also found that fuckin CD, its at this kids house in dearborn, so I have to go get it sometime  Oscoda in five days.  but other then that, ill cya all later
