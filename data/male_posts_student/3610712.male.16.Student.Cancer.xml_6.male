We then watched The Last Samurai, which is a very cool movie indeed. After that Sarah and I watched the Tetris masters (Randall and Zack) test their skills against eachother while eating popcorn, looking through National Geographics and discussing The Mall in Washington, D.C. After that I made an unsuccessful pilgrimage to Randy's computer in an effort to find the "I Love the 90's" promo commercial. We then watched a flash, and then I left. Goodnight.
