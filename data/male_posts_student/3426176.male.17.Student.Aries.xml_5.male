Today, I had a U.S. History final (it sucked massively) and a Physics final. (it wasn't too bad)  Tomorrow I have a Religion final and an English final.  Again, I didn't study.  OK, now that the boring crap is out of the way, it is time for what really matters.  CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL!!!  'Twas a great final.  It was between France's AS Monaco and Portugal's FC Porto.  These two teams defyed all odds as they are not the heavyweights of European football.  (That's soccer if you don't speak European)    AS Monaco were the lucky dogs of the competition as they beat Germany's Bayern Munich 2-2 on aggregate, (away goals 1-0) shocked the world with a stunning come from behind win against Spain's supergiants Real Madrid 5-5 on aggregate, (away goals 3-2) and eased past Chelsea 5-3 on aggregate to lead them to the final.  FC Porto reached the final when Benni McCarthy sunk England's supergiants Manchester United with a last minute goal.  Porto won the series 3-2 on aggregate.  Porto then got past France's Olympique Lyonnais 4-2 on aggregate.  Porto would play Spain's Deportivo La Coruna for 180 minutes and manage only one goal, (and that was from the penalty spot) but that was all they needed as they advanced to the final 1-0 on aggregate.  Then today's final...  Monaco ended up playing a dreadful match and gave the cup to FC Porto three goals to nil.
