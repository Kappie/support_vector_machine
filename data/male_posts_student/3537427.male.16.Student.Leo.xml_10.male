Stacey wasnt actually that "difficult" today. She bought pizza for all 3 of us and then watched "Van Wilder" with us, yet another awesome movie. "write that down."  Later on I downloaded a bunch-o-new music. Got some Sugarcult, a little Fall Out Boy, and some Blink. I was inspired by Van Wilder and got a few songs from that movie, like "bouncing off the walls" and "stuck in america" by sugarcult and thats all i've done all day.
