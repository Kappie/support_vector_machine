The blogger said it was sorry. this weekend has been fun so far, tomorrow's Sunday and the same thing happens every Sunday. It started off with me and Heaton going to Kaiser's. Tom had a bunch of his friends over. We all...um... hung. William Hung. Sound the same eh? Checked out James' new crib. It's l33t. Played his piece of shit drumset that's made by little tykes or something. Then Heaton slept over my house. We started to watch Monty Python but I passed out. Sorry Mike. The movie just didn't catch my type of humor. Anyways, today was band practice with James, Matt and Heaton. Dan came and helped out with back up guitar and hung out with us. We made an original, well they already had it, I added a drum part to it. Ok so everyone went home except Dan. He ate over and at night we went to Paul's. We ate fluffernutter sandwiches. Then watched some William Hung videos. Then we watched the end of Amityville Horror and then the beginning of Amityville Horror 2. Back to back. They left. I'm extremely tired so that's why if you're wondering why I'm being so vague. Is that how you spell vague? Oh well. The Jumbles man, the Jumbles.
