He brought up some good points, but it was really funny when he mentioned Socialism.  Half the  pendajos   there were like oh yeah.  That's the good stuff.  Haha.  It was pretty great.  But it got out at like damn 5 pm, and I had to walk.  So I got home like 5:40, later then I've ever gotten home walking, but the  vatos  at Seton Hall must really have assumed I was a student there, being there that late.  So it's all good.    The Asha thing, I feel pretty on and off about it.  I really don't know what to feel, probubly the result of "disharmony between my multiple consciousness" or some crazy thing like that, but I'm pretty confused on which road to take.
