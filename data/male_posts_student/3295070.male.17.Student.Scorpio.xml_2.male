It's a short film where the actors are small figures made out of fiunny shaped pipe cleaners . . . i spent almost 45 minutes making both of the figures . . . and I think they look OK, but on the camera, they dont look all that good. The one is evil, and the other is gonna get melted . . . .        Ok, so between that last paragraph and this one, I smoked a bowl, attached wires to the evil guy to i dont have to hold it directly in front of the camera . . . and made a stand for my webcam so i can record it all . . . . arent I resourceful? they dont call me Steve for nothing you know . . . oh yeah, and that thing that I have to download for the stop motion to work is gonna take like 5 hours! nuts eh? ah well . . . im starting to babble, arent I? oh well! Its my blog and I'll babble if i damn well feal like it!       Sorry I dont have much interesting to say . . . like I said before, Im not really sure what im doing yet, so the posts are gonna suck for a while . . . and its true . . . but i assure you they'll get better, so keep comin back . . . because I just have a fealing that this will eventually get interesting, and maybe even WORTH reading . . . wierd eh? well anywho . . . I think thats about all the uninteresting crap I have to say tonight! but if any of you actually want to see the movie when im done, i'll be more than happy to show it to you! but seeing as how ive run out of things to say . . . i think i'll end 'er here.       Adios
