I recently just finished taking the American Red Cross's lifegaurd certifcation class, so I can possibly get a job at my home-town pool, and today we went to a lifegaurd inservice with all the hired lifegaurds so we could see how things work and how they prepare for emergancies and such. Let me start off by saying that all of this started at 8 in the morning, I hadn't even had breakfast yet, not even a Mountain Dew, so needless to say I was out of it. This is where the story gets good!    So I'm sitting there, eating a donut, half awake, when someone brings up the Friday Protest that I part take in every week (see Protesting the Leftist Ideology for background on that.) Now, one of the life gaurds there is a Leftist..to say the very least. She has written tons of letters to the nespaper critisizing Bush, The GOP, and Right-Wingers in general. Shes Michael Moore...just a lot better looking. Anyway, she asked me if I was for, or against Sissy, she didn't know because she spends most of her time in College in Nebraska. The dialogue went something like this:  Me: I'm very must against him  Her: Well why?  Me: Because I can be  Her: Well whats your reasoning, your rational?  Me: Personally, I believe that its disgraceful and disrespectful that our troops go over there, liberate 25+ million people, and he has the audacity to say that they are over there for oil and money.  Her: He's not protesting the War...he's protesting us being over there!  I'm   a Political Science Major, Whitey,   I   know what I'm talking about.  Me: The funny thing about Political Science is that even if your wrong, if you have a degree in it, you can still be considered an expert.   Her: Well most people in Iraq actually want Saddam back in power you know!  Me (with a look of utter shock at what I'd just heard) And where have you been getting your news from? What are your sources?  Her: From the news  Me: What news?  Her: Well I watch all the news channals...well except for FoxNews...its propagandist  Me: Ok, lets get back to the topic, because what YOU just said put you with the likes of Michael Moore, thus destroying what little credibility you had. You believe that the War in Iraq was wrong and we never should have gone there. I believe that we liberated 25 million people. You're not going to change my mind, and I'm not going to change yours. End of story  Her: Well is that YOUR opinion or your PARENTS?!  Me: Well is it YOUR opinion or your Poli Sci Professors?  Her: WELL YOUR JUST IGNORANT AND STUPID! (stomps off like a child)  Ladies and gentlemen, what you just read was a transcript of a 16 year old (Me, your buddy Whitey McCracka) owning a Political Science Major in college ("Her" the foaming at the mouth Liberal) Yes, yes...give it a second to sink in...Ok!
