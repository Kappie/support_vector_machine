I am against it. However, I think it is extremely shortsighted and wrong to outlaw it completely. There are certain circumstances where abortion should be strongly considered. Specifically they are in the case of rape or incest and when the health of either the baby (it can be conclusively shown that they baby will not be viable outside the womb) or the mother is threatened. In all those circumstances (which overall are extremely rare) abortion should be an option that can be considered by the mother (in the case or rape/incest) and in conjunction with a doctor (in the health related causes).  I think the phrases of "Pro-life" and "Pro-choice" obscure the debate quite a bit. You could term me a pro-life advocate, but I'm also pro the life of the mother. If her life is threatened through pregnancy she should be able to get an abortion. But overal I would prefer the term anti-abortion. I like to be very clear where I stand and that term is more accurate. That being said, I also don't stand with the radical anti-abortionists. I definitely am willing to consider abortion in very limited circumstances, and I am unwilling to prosecute my views to the point of violence. Pro-choice as a term just offends my sensibilities - you're not pro-choice you're pro-abortion. By saying your pro-choice you're trying to hide an ugly term and sanitize your stance. Call a spade a spade, please.  The basis of my position is that of responsibility. I believe that the power to procreate is a special thing. The ability to create life ought to be taken every bit as seriously as the ability to take a life. Nobody in their right mind says they are "pro-death" - it just doesn't make sense. Life is to be cherished. The ability to create a life should not be taken lightly, and yet that is exactly the position of pro-abortionists. In essence they don't want to take responsibility for that incredible power. If you are willing to take the risk of using your procreative powers in a manner that will create a life, then you should take responsibility for your decisions and take responsibility for that life. I find it telling that more people are concerned with sexually transmitted diseases than they are about abortion. Yet they are both tied to the exact same phenomenon - abuse of the powers of procreation.  Every woman has, within the limits of nature, the right to choose what will or will not happen to her body. Every woman has, at the same time, the responsibility for the way she uses her body. If by her choice she behaves in such a way that a human fetus is conceived, she has not only the right to but also the responsibility for that fetus. If it is an unwanted pregnancy, she is not justified in ending it with the claim that it interferes with her right to choose. She herself chose what would happen to her body by risking pregnancy. She had her choice. If she has no better reason, her conscience should tell her that abortion would be a highly irresponsible choice.  What constitutes a good reason? Since a human fetus has intrinsic and infinite human value, the only good reason for an abortion would be the violation or deprivation of or the threat to the woman’s right to choose what will or will not happen to her body. Social, educational, financial, and personal considerations alone do not outweigh the value of the life that is in the fetus. These considerations by themselves may properly lead to the decision to place the baby for adoption after its birth, but not to end its existence in utero.  The woman’s right to choose what will or will not happen to her body is obviously violated by rape or incest. When conception results in such a case, the woman has the moral as well as the legal right to an abortion because the condition of pregnancy is the result of someone else’s irresponsibility, not hers. She does not have to take responsibility for it. To force her by law to carry the fetus to term would be a further violation of her right. She also has the right to refuse an abortion. This would give her the right to the fetus and also the responsibility for it. She could later relinquish this right and this responsibility through the process of placing the baby for adoption after it is born. Whichever way is a responsible choice.  Is this position a moral one? Absolutely. But most laws are in essence based on morality. If we were to take off all laws based on morality so that our government could not punish anyone because of a decision or action they considered moral there would be few laws on the books left.
