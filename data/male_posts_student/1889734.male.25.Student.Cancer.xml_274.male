Take a look at the details!  45 hours of extra footage, and each movie contains restored scenes.  Alien 3 was always my biggest disappointment.  While it is directed by Fincher (who is like a God to me), it never came together in a coherent story.  I sensed some possibilities, but they never appeared on screen.  This version restores 17 minutes, which might be crucial.    Anyway, if you are a fan of the first two Alien films, you should be aware of this.  I am insanely jealous of Mike, since he has already ordered it and the product is in shipment.
