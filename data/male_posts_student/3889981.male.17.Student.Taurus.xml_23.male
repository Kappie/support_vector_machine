My earlier attempts at freelance imagination journalism have been just that - imagination, nothing more.  To prevent others from thinking that I have conflicting ideas, I have hence decided to remove the article on The Establishment.  The second point is, of course, that I would like to apologise to those who have found me irritating, lame, short, ugly, and those bad points, of course. I will give my all to try to reduce the first two properties that I seem to have, but I can't do anything about the latter, though. I can't afford plastic surgery, you know.  I don't make enough money on writing articles on this blog. On the contrary, I think I may get sued and fined.  That's about all for amendments. Thank you for your understanding.
