There were a couple of guys I was staying with last week who made me think: what is a geek? And what is a nerd? They were both rather nerdy, but what made them that way, and why did I define them as such?  It takes more than playing computer games to make one a geek. While I don't currently play any computer games, I'm sure I would if I had a better computer. But that doesn't make me a geek. No, I think that being a geek is a serious pasttime: building one's own computers, programming, and knowing how to run Linux (I only found out last week that it was an operating system; Giles if you laugh I'll just call you a geek :P). There is of course the famous definition that every nerd is either a pizza nerd or a coffee nerd - the pizza ones tend to be spotty, and occasionally fat, and the coffee ones wear glasses and are neurotic (am I generalising? No, of course not).  So I have a rough idea of what a geek or nerd is. But is there a difference between the two? I think a nerd tends to be more professional, a nerd is more likely to be a professional programmer than a geek, and while one might be able to become a geek if one spent  all  of one's time playing computer games, I don't think the same is true of a nerd.  But anyway, this is just my impression, and there will be much conflicting opinion. I welcome it!
