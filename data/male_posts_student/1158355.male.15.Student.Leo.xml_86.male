I bought these cool Agent Smith sunglasses and that's how I scared her... just popped out of nowhere. We met Jared there after looking for him in the moonbounces. We bought sugary popcorn, a churro and Jared got himself a tube full of sugar? Ok, so after it all, Jared left, me and Matt saw Ryan G and watched him kick ass at the pitching game. He won a prize... a baseball that is attached to a string and flies back at you, breaking your nose. So basically, it's $3 to impossibly get over the high speed of your age, and when you do get it, all you get is a broken nose from the bounce back baseball. It was so dum, the guy must of been retarded... he had 13-15 yo must throw 60 and then 16 and up must throw 80. How is that possible? One year from 15 to 16, getting a 20 mph pitch difference. The wife heard me call the guy insane and gave me a look. Then sprayed Bryan Rankee with ass. It's a can of ass. Well it's called Fart Spray but it literally smells like an actual asshole. I had it on my finger and I wiped it on Matt, we didn't lose the ass smell until an hour later. Then we arrived at Paul's house after a very long walk. Matt went home because he didn't want to see Ricky make out with Erin while Paul makes out with Emily. It didn't bother me so I stayed. It was so funny, Matt called his mom to pick him up and some how, literally 20 seconds later, his mom came! So I watched 2 movies, Old School and Billy Madison (3/4 of Billy). It was very funny watching them all make out. One day I'll be in Ricky or Paul's spot fucking hot girls... some day... I think. Ok, so until next time. Keep reading my blogger and I'll keep laughing at you.
