He banged on the church door and told the woman who opened it she'd better call the fire department.     She ran to the phone to place the call. She identified herself, gave the location, and explained the situation.     "You mean to tell me," said the emergency dispatcher, "that there's a burning bush on the church lawn, and you want us to put it out?!?"     BTW, 6 books have yet to be found in the story posted below. The ones that have been found are (and the context they were in): Mark (remark) Luke (lulu. Kept) Revelation (a revelation) James (a jam, especially) Ruth (truth) Numbers (to numbers) Job (real job) Judges (require judges) Lamentations (loud lamentations) (I,II) Peter (compete. Relax)
