Empty is her heart, and hurt is her soul Mommy saw her,but a tissue, she did not offer. Tears streaming down, as their callousness, her heart,it pierced.  Their attention she tried to sieze, their love she tried to earn. But how? when her feelings, they repeatedly crush............ In her heart, a love for them it hid, clouded by hate Feeling unwated, in sleep she tries to sedate........  Sitting there alone as her sisters play, But her problems she do not wish to say. An injured soul, indeed, looking for comfort. But all she got were replies, almost curt. I walked towards her, with her friends behind. Words of love is my gift, and hugs are our present. For in amongst us, solace can she find.  Walking out that huge door, an emotional baggage left behind. Daddy does not care, as her sisters continue playing. Her house, she does not belong, in her nest, love, she could not find. As she left, Mommy's face, it was not sad. But Looking back, this home, she would never ever want to come back..........
