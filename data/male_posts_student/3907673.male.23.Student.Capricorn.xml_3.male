Nw then i know hw hard all this sauces are to be made. The process is long and tiring. so the lesson learnt is nv to waste products, even if it's a sauce... Lol.. Just joking.   I love lessons on tues, thurs, and sat. only practical. hehe. then if we do the task fast and everyone gets together to clean up the kitchen fast, then we can call it a day. but today, sad to say, someone in my group nv coperate. Instead of helping to clean up and wait for the teacher to finish inspecting, he left for home,making us clear up his shit.. F***ing bustard. I'm sure he would be rewarded... with demerit points... If not it would be unfair for the rest of us. Normally, my class which is divided into two groups, and i'm in the 1st group would finish and end the lesson earlier than the other, but because of this bustard, today the class end at 1pm, later than the other.   Other than the lesson today, my project group had a gathering today, we discussed abt the project for food, and gathered all the informations abt the topic that we had wanted to do, and found out that it was not easy, so in the end decided to change a different topic, so in the end, all the effort was wasted, but not really, at least we learnt somethings from the 1st topic that we wanted to do. The discussion was quite a short one though, and the nxt meeting was decided to be nxt tues.   Tkink that's all for today, tomolo still got class, and can u imagine, tomolo would be getting the chef uniform too. hehe, finally  Cheers Thomas
