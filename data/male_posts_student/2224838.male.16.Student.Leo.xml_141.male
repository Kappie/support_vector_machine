I have yet to mention anything of his passing because, up until now, I knew very little of him. For this reason, I thought that I would remember Ronald Reagan with bits of his humor that I have picked up over the past few days. The following quotes are from  urlLink Ronald Reagan's page on IMDB . Most of them made me laugh out loud.   The best view of government is seen on a rear view mirror as one is driving away from it."  "Recession is when your neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose yours. Recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his." - in the 1980 campaign  "I love three things in life: drama, politics and sports and I'm not sure they always come in that order." - in 1964  "I remember some of my own views when I was quite young. For heaven's sake, I was even a Democrat!" - 1980  "Honey, I forgot to duck." - to his wife after the assassination attempt  "I hope all of you are Republicans." - to his doctors prior to going in the surgery room after being shot  "Does Nancy know about us?" - semi-consciously, to the nurse who hauled him on the gurney  "I know what it's like to pull the Republican lever for the first time, because I used to be a Democrat myself, and I can tell you it only hurts for a minute and then it feels just great." - 1980  "I've been criticized for going over the heads of the Congress. So, what's the fuss? A lot of things go over their heads." - 1985  "Politics is not a bad profession. If you succeed there are many rewards; if you disgrace yourself you can always write a book."  "You can tell a lot about a fellow's character by his way of eating jellybeans."  "Government is not the solution to our problems. Government IS the problem!"  "Now, I understand my opponent has been using age as an issue. However, I'll refrain from using his youth and inexperience against him." - said in a debate in 1984 in reference to Walter Mondale  "I have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency - even if I'm in a Cabinet meeting."  "My fellow Americans. I'm pleased to announce that I've signed legislation outlawing the Soviet Union. We begin bombing in five minutes." - opening an April Fool's Day press conference at the White House  "They say hard work never hurt anybody, but I figure why take the chance."  "Well, I learned a lot....I went down to Latin America to find out from them and (learn) their views. You'd be surprised. They're all individual countries."  "When I go in for a physical, they no longer ask how old I am. They just carbon-date me."  "Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born."
