I went to Wendy's house today. Hmm...I studied all the remaining E-Maths chapters, and revised Physics. Meow meow! I think Physics is okay le ba...I am atill unsure about my E-Maths though...I revise some more tomorrow morning lor.  After revision, I lazed around lor, waiting for Wendy's mother to come back so we can go down to eat. I slept halfway, but woke up after hearing myself snore. So embarrassing. Meow meow. Both of us then lazed around lor. Wendy had a terrible stomach ache. I told her to go rest, she don't want. Meow!! Get well soon hor.   Her mother came back, and after a while, took us down fof dinner. HaHa! Her mother treated me Vanilla Coke today, but she refused to let Wendy drink becuase of her stomach. Ooo! Wendy always felt her mom always treats me better than her ("You are like a spoilt brother that I never had"). Meow!! Not my fault! She should discuss this with her mother. Meow! Anyway, I brought back Wanton Mee for brother.   When I came back, Uncle Steven was there. He came to repair my brother's computer. Meow!! I took a bath and came online.   Aiyah. I am kinda scared and nervous. Tomorrow's O Levels leh. We have been waiting for this moment for 4 years! 4 freaking years! And it finally arrived! Oh my! Best of luck to me tomorrow! :)  Alright..I think I stop blogging. To those who are reading this: Good luck for your Os! May you socred grades that you are proud of! :) See ya tomorrow!
