But yes, they will be posting things possibly similar or completely different then the topics that i will write about. But that's the great thing about it, 3 different people, 3 different places, 3 completely different views thus creating a wider variety of Blogs. Anyways I hopes yous all enjoy my little piece of reality. -Matt
