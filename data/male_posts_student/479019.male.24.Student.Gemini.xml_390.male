I got into the city around 2 PM on Friday and wandered about the city until about 5:30, when I took a bus down to NJ. After a bit of bus switching due to my stupid ass getting on the wrong bus at the Port Authority, I got to Ridgewood. The weekend was rather relaxing and nice. It was pretty much just hang around my aunt and uncle's house and going shopping with them. Tuesday morning was when I headed back to the city and spent the day at the Guggenheim and the Metropolitan Museum.   I found it amusing that there was an installation art project at the Guggenheim that had images of Agnostic Front and Murphy's Law playing inside the Guggenheim. I'm betting 99% of museum goers didn't even know who they were. I don't know how many modern art fans are into hardcore punk.  Oh yea... that Greyhound pit stop 15 miles out of Binghamton pisses me off to no end... so close to home... we don't need to take a damn 15 minute break.  ***
