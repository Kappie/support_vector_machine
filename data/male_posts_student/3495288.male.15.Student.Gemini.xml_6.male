Well nothing special happened to me during the 6 hours of curriculum time in school. After that i have to go for band as it is compulsory since the attendance is pathetic. Shazwanie, Brenda, Grace and Me went around the whole school search for those  BAKAS!  man so tiring go up and down the staircase. After band, i heard that a few of the members are quiting band and some have already quitted band. Like than i heard more are quitting if one goes the rest also goes. Walau! so stressed up! I am now worried for the band's future. Can someone help us! AH!  Well till here lah. Bye
