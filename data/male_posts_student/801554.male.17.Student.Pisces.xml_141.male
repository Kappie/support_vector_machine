       
      Sat down today and jotted down some notes for a short story I want to write. the Great American novel is inside me; it's only a matter of time. And I wrote a poem.  TIME.  Last to run First to stop When does it end And another begin For the space between Old and new Is just meant for your eyes only not the eyes of the man on the other side of the wall Take the time Take all the time you need.
