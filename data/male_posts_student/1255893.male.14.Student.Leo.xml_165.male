Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?  We have all been to those meetings where someone wants you to give over  100%.  How about achieving 103%?  Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions:  If: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z is represented as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26, then:  H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  and, K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%  But, A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%  And, B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T 21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103%  and, look how far ass kissing will take you: A-S-S--K-I-S-S-I-N-G 1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118%  So, one can then conclude with mathematical certainty that:  While Hard work and Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude will get you there, Bullshit and Ass Kissing will put you over the top!
