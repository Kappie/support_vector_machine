But it everything was ok. Except that Mrs Bala accused me of copying...T.T argh...nevermind. Bascially, sectionals was super duper crappy. We weren't even practicing. We were just playing for fun. Haiz...can't we just get serious. I got a chance to walk around city area alone today for nothing. I felt free suddenly. Like I was able to forget all my worries. Then I was waiting for the bus at Marina. I just thought, how great would it be to just go walk about alone in a park and just think abou stuff. Then I was thinking of getting some friends along to go to Sentosa and enjoy ourselves during the holidays. Then after that can stay over at someone's house also. cool...probably my old friends from primary school. Really miss them. Either way, I'm hoping to get away from stuff. I really look forward to that... I also don't really no what to say. But I have to admit I have alot of plans now. I really hope to enjoy and to forget all the worries I have now. I might be back later. But likely, I won't be here tomorrow. Cause I'll be having Student Life meeting again. So tiring. There's band prac somemore. So pray for energy tomorrow!
