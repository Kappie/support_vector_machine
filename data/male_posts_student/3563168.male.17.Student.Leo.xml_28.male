If you don't know, Liberty's Kids are badass little bitches that go around learning things about the Revolutionary War. They're journalists for Ben Franklin's newspaper and every event that goes down you get to see a British and American side.    Now I don't like little kids that much, actually, I don't like them at all. However, "Liberty's Kids" is awesome because it tries to get kids to look up to people like George Washington. None of these gay contemporary heroes like Static Shock, Mucha Lucha, or Pok√©mon. Just some good old fashion Generals and founding fathers. Wouldn't that kick ass if every little kid idolized people like George Washington? Holy shit, then we would live in a utopia.         If I'm ever a parent, all I'm going to let my kid watch on TV is "Liberty's Kids".
