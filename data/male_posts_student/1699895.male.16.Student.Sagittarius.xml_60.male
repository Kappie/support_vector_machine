Then I went to phils to practice, and after that we went to senate, and came back to my house to play basketball and swim.  Then I went and saw I, Robot with Sean and his friends. That movie was really good, but the ending was no where near the books ending, but they have to make a happy ending i guess to get better reviews.   Now I have to find my memory card again, cause dad moves everything around to make it seem "clean".  Today I think I'm having family come over from chicago and philly to visit. How come all of my cool relatives live so far away? But it should be good anyways, so ill see everyone later
