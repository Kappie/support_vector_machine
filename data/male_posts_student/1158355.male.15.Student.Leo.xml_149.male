Last night, the opening night of Revolutions, there was a black out 5 minutes into the movie so I got free tickets for tonight. Last night it stopped right when Seraph was about to get shot but he really doesn't. Tonight, I finally saw it and half the theatre cheered when the movie had passed round 2 after the Seraph scene because there wasn't another black out. Funny it was raining again, it will keep raining until Revolutions leaves the theatre...my dumb theory. Ok, I'm in a huge debate right now on which Matrix was the best. I think it was the 1st one but then again the Reloaded/Revolutions was awesome. Damnit, I can't decide...anyhow Revolutions had an ironic and most unpredictable ending twisting ending so go see it for yourself. Ok goodnight.
