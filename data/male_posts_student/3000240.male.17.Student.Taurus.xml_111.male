The majority included how to destroy Katherine and Becky in one swift execution, the other, which was the far more horrific of the two, involved me extensively analyzing what I would do If the shingles in my wrist got worse and I developed a motor neuroneish disorder, or worse, a limb castration. You can see how my life's priorities are just  swell  at the present time.  Anyway on a lighter note, I've changed the format in the blog in the past week, with the help of Jen, to, in my opinion, give it a touch more professional appeal. It's more defined, colorful, with more links than before. Well it is my eyes only, even if they are more corrupted than patients on prosaic . . .  Finally got round to purchasing a new Â£30 (ooh BuBz really splashed out there hasn't he) "JanSport" hiker/skater bag. It's something I always quite craved when I was around the age of 14, and, I just decided to see whether those dreams of a "funkier look" would be more justified even at a later age ofadolescencee.  The new NIN album "bleedthrough" has been playing on my mind somewhat. It came upon me during an Eminem sing-along near the couches (a.k.a the sofa crew), and I'm really desperate for Trent to show pop music for what it really is - meh I can't be bothered to go into it now; only 3 years until I die slowly from terminal illness, and not nearly enough time to divulge into great detail. Well, must be of now for Psychology so . . . xBuBzx
