He did the God wave, and then I knew that's who I was talking to.  And then he told me to give Laura a back rub, but she was standing to close to the wall, so I asked her to move.  Then she ran and Bob told me not to chase her.  And suddenly there was an escalator.  So I took it up I ended up in the same place again.
