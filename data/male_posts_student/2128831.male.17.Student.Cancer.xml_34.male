How can one taste so sweet in the rising tempo of passion? To live, to love and to breathe together - as one... how many have the fortune?     Not too many it seems   Life is still the same, like things that happened to you in when you are six years old. Your world was Sesame Street, your rubber band collection, your favorite booger-stained t-shirt. You ate the paste, licking the stick; it tasted good, you didn't question it. Don't lie!  You did, you did, you did!  *stomps feet childishly* Ha, I win!!!.  And if your Mom decided to have an unholy alliance with your kindergarten teacher to cast you in a tacky school play, you didn't question that either.  Life plays out and you have little control.  But, that is fine it is all gravy, for you need to allow it to go!  It all works itself out.  So now I think I will now be able to catch up on all the trashy romance novels in the communal library in our laundry room, where we swap romance novels like swingers at a party. Don't yall?  What you don't *loser cough* But when the question comes to decide between a Silhouette Romance or porn, porn always seems to win out. Romancing myself is easy no awkward moments, no polite chit-chat. Just a quick encounter no deep feelings, just a few drops of tears at the end. Nothing a little Kleenex won't fix.  But when others romance me it is more difficult, you need to work at it, and I am not sure if it is really possible But, continue to try.   So I was doing some thinking, I wanna have a TWIN.  Being a twin, having someone who looks just like you, has its advantages. You can share discount cards, gym IDs, Hello Kitty fanclub memberships.  What don't lie, don't lie!!!!! You sooo want one! You can look at clothes objectively because you have someone who can wear it for you before you buy it. It means that you can eliminate bad fashion choices, unfortunate punk haircuts or being blonde without having to live through the embarrassment yourself. Being a twin means that there is someone who can read your mind without you saying a word. Yeah, and they say that if you are left-handed you would have had a twin that died before birth.  Damn you nature!!!  I WANT MY TWIN *stomps feet again* I do, I do, I do!  *continuously stomps* It is hard to overcome how society views us queers, but I will. I just wished I was able to go through it with my friends or family for that is the way it should be. Maybe it would have been easier. Maybe a lot less lonely.  Society still in smaller areas is so homophobic and turns against the different or the odd, it isn't fair and it isn't right, what have I done to deserve whispers behind my back?  Have I done anything wrong?  I am myself and that is all, but I will deal!  I really will!  	Lol, a couple thinks to chat about.  John is 99.99% gay, not bi, so sorry to him Geezzz, people are so hard to please.  *rolls eyes*
