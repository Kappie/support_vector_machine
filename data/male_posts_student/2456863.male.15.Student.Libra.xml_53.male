Yes its sortof chating but i don't care.   New front page  3/14/2004   I decided my front page needed some work... so i renevated it.  Yesterday was my eagle (Not eagly mary... lol) ceremony and it was quite fun... I messed up a little on my speech, but everyone said they thought it was really good.  It was quite funny when we got home and I opened all the cards people got me and kept getting more money (as I was expecting; matt warned me) she's like "I could go shopping with all that money!" and I just laughed and asked why I couldn't.  I got a new watch from my parents too, i have to have it fitted soon though, and some silver dollars with eagles on them and a whole bunch of stuff really.  I g2g alex is comin soon.    nobody writes much anymore :(  3/15/2004   It seems like nobody writes much in here anymore... not that i do or ever did but still, cmon guys.  I finnished my planner redecoration today.  The back as of yesterday night had (if you didn't see it today) most of the alias characters along the top, an awesome finding nemo picture below that and homestar on the bottom.  i just finnished the front a few minutes ago.  At the top theres a big picture of jennifer garner (Syd) Eric H. knows how hard my printer tried to make her not look hot... lol Theres another one below it with red hair, the awesome vintage 007 logo i found, and this sign that says "NO TRESPASSING... Items May Explode If Handled.  Removal of Items Projibited Under Penalty of Law."  And yes it's really a real sign, I took a pic of it in OBX (thats outer banks).  then on the back side of that sheet is another big picture, this one of michael vartan (Vaughn) and below that 3 more little ones of JG and one of victor garber (Jack).  Yes I may be insane.  Anyway, I wrote a poem last night I'll have to put up here but I didn't really have much free time today (after the eash project and my decorating) so I couldn't do it today.  Tsch!  Hey Hey  3/16/2004   Such a descriptive title. :-P  You probabaly know how i always said taht the first 3 trombones were about equal?  well I take it back.  Peter isn't as good as me and katie.  I almost wanted to scream "You see those little things on the edge of the paper? they're called the key signature" to him but i contained myself...  He'd probably be fine if he actually tried or practiced once in a while but since he doesn't....  alors, :P I went in to get my watch sized today.  And nate installed gunbound.  FINALLY... you'd think giving out 8 cds would yield more people who actually use them.... and i didn't give them to people who didn't want them... ah nevermind most of ya probably dont even know what i'm talking about, gunbound.  I suppose I'll put my two most recent poetic endeavors here since nobody reads my blog....  "Shrouding Smoke" The smoke shrouds the arena. Blurs the boundaries and hovers low.  That which was once Black and White, Now is as the greasy gray of the smoke. That which was once Right and Wrong, Now is subject to fiery debate. That which was once obviously clear, Now is confused and distorted.  Those who once stood behind, Now are in the fray. Those who made amends, Now stand high and see. Those who need a vision, Now have eyes shrouded.  The smoke shrouds the arena, And alas, that which was unknown, Unknown remains. -March 15, 2004   "Tower in the Sea" There once was an old gray tower in the Sea, A lone pillar of stone, A solemn sentinel to the profusion. It's smoothly curvd walls dissonant With the roughly hewn slabs, Giving wind of the mode within. A blazing glow once emanated from the walk, Unceasingly probing into the Great Deep. Crimson anger flowing from its lodgment, Lightning engaging the clouds skyward. There once was an old gray tower in the Sea. -March 16, 2004 We now come to the end of the day, Goodnight to you, rest you soul.
