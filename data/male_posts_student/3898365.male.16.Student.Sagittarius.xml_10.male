It was just me, her, and Amy and we didn't do anything spectacularly interesting, just lazed around and played with sock monkeys and watched the Clerks Cartoons. But something seemed different and it was crazy fun. It sucks that I always have to leave. I never ever want to leave Robin's house. But since I have a penis, I can never spend the night. Damn you, penis. Ruining everything.  But mum said I had to be home around midnight. I decided to walk home since it was nice out and I don't live very far away from Robin's house. One of my favorite things has to be walking around at night. I hate walking around during the day, because there's so many cars around and there's so many other people outside and I feel uncomfortable. I feel like everybody is looking at me and judging me. But at night, there's really nobody around. Everything is closed and dark and it seems a lot more private. I can walk around with my headphones on and feel like the world was put here just for me. I get to feel egotistical and not feel bad about it.  I'm starting to look forward to the camping trip. The lake right next to the campsite is just heavenly. The snow and ice and glaciers from Mt. Baker melt and run right down into Baker Lake, so it's always really cold, which will kick the 90 degree weather's tight little ass.
