Then I might see a movie with Nikki, Lucy and Ari so I have to finish with Toby at like 4:30... Then I need to get a ride back... Then I need to meet them at Bay Street... Come home at like 10 and finish my book report...  so im nervous about 3 things  1. that for some reason noah wont come to tobys house cuz he forgot or if toby forgets... or if i go to the wrong house (his moms instead of his dads) 2. bay street wont work out... 3. i wont finish book report  Hopefully everything will work out.
