Since getting back from Summerland after the long weekend around the first of the month, it seems like I've had no time to myself. I run straight home after work, work some more, then either go to church or out to some pressing engagement that I have.  Not that I am complaining. No real stress involved or anything. I'm just getting tired.  Anyways, I have more plans this weekend believe it or not. I have family from BC coming to see me for a night. Don't know what we are gonna do yet. Something fun I hope.  So my love Jenny has determined that she is going to try and buy me a gift. I don't know why, and she can't really explain why to me either. She just wants to do it. What's more, she wants to buy me an expensive gift. I really don't want her to. People don't buy me expensive gifts, and this is an odd sensation, but she is determined. Not that I don't love her, or want to stifle her love for me, or don't appreciate the thought and feeling she has put into this expression, but I just have a problem with people spending large amounts of money on me. I don't know really.  I guess this is the power of a blog. I can express it, and articulate my thoughts in a way that may someday help me understand. (Not to mention the record kept of these things)  Ramble, ramble, ramble...........  Anyways. More work calls.  Shalom.
