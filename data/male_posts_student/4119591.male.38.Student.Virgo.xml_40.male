It's a large affair and, depending upon your political leanings, either significantly important or more of the same.  Either way, you might want to check out all the  urlLink blogging  that is going on from the convention floor. So far it looks as if the traditional journalists are busy interviewing the unconventional journalists, keeping these blog-stars from getting much of anything done. We'll see if they have another excuse as the week goes on.   I'm not a huge fan of either major political party so please don't take this as an endorsement for the Dems. For the most part, I'm interested to see if there is any noteworthy difference between what comes out of traditional news outlets and what appears on the blogs. I'm hoping that the GOP will allow similar reporting at their convention later on this year.  (Allen lives somewhere between wonksville and geekland.)
