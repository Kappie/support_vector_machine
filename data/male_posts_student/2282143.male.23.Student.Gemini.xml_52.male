I look at the links from where people find my site, and one was a google seach for "cures for epididymitis"  Dude, get some drugs (anitbiotics cause usually its caused by an STD if you have any discharge or hemauria - blood in urine or in my case, frequent irritation from kicking), ice it, and elevate it.  Ibuprofin works too if you've got my kind of problem with it.  But I dunno if thats cool, funny, or just plain sick that I come up for that.  Ive decided that Im pretty much exercise bulemic.  Today was insanity.  I went to TKD for 4 straight hours today, teaching both the 4:30 and 7:00 classes.  Did iron body and iron palm in between classes with a ton of kicks, deep breathing, a bit o bench press and butterfly, situps, and going nuts on the bag for a while.  Then at the end of the 7pm class, I did a 2 on one with a couple of black belts.  Needless to say, IM TIRED.  And with that, gonna grab a quick bite to eat and drink a gallon of water as I lost 4 pounds of water weight tonight, then shower and bed.  Yikes.  PS... my nut is starting to hurt again.
