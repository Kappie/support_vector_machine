I think that this game and Super smash bros. melee 'have been'/'are going to be' the most played of my GC-games. And definiately the ones which are going to last the longest.  Well enough about my GC. Okay, SSX 3 for gamecube is my newest game as mentioned. I haven't played as much as my brother, so I've only unlocked peak 2, but I'm very good at the super pipe for being a beginner I think, over 550 000 points is my record!(on peak 1) =D  MUSIC The music in the game is really good too. It's so good that you don't even notive that it is playing and that's when game music is the best. When it just follows the game rythm. Some really good songs, and not too few, so you don't hear the same all the time. And as far as I know there aren't any irritating sounds from the "snowers" (skaters?).  LIFETIME Well I think there are about 10 differents characters that you can complete the game with, and earn experience for. So if you wanna complete it with everybody it is going to take a while. There are three different peaks and all of the peaks contain 4 descents, and on all of these you can either just race normally or race freestyle and try to get as much points as possible, in freestyle mode there is also a super pipe. The last thing there is is freeride. In freeride mode you just snow (skate?) down the peaks from the top, and you can try out some challenges after the way down, or just collect money to buy new accesories with.  CONTROLLS The controls are just so perfect, I couldn't have done it better myself, really. It's so easy to just start snowing (skating?) but if you wanna get good you'll have to train at least a little. It is very natural buttons and not some weird combinations.  GRAPHICS This game is really beautiful. Wow, nice graphic, that looks almost like real. Well, it is really nice, smooth and not rugged/unpolished(?), so. And it really feels like you are going in fast speed here and no lag as far as I'm concerned. Really nice jumps and cool tricks.  SUMMARY I would give this game, 10 out of 10 pixels. Because it's one of the best and most fun games I've played in along time. All of the above subjects weighs into that mark. And I also need to say, that this game is not for you guys who think that an extreme sports game should be over-realistic, because here it's boost and 'I don't know what'. BTW, there are LOTS of secret ways to go ;)  Buy SSX 3 today if you have any interest in snowboard or skateboard games whatsoever!!
