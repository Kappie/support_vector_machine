If you ever need to learn life, learn from this GURU.Don't say I love you to any gal, till you learn to say "I". This guy, hence, could never say that to any gal coz he says always "WE". One of the coolest guy around. Cricket was not the same before he started playing it. Silver Medalist, topper of his batch. I spend 3 years with him and I can say you need only three years to earn a friend of lifetime. Oh, yeah he is very handsome and very much single ( I guess !!).   urlLink   http://people.cornell.edu/pages/vr46
