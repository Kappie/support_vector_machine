I get the feeling that I'm being misunderstood, and I think that my friend has done stupid stuff. I don't think we hate one another, but things are different now.  I hate doing and thinking stuff like that, because I have a sort of thing with loyalty. I don't like to give up on people. When I say that I want to be there for someone, I mean when I say it... and despite later reluctance, I still mostly mean it (even now).   It's weird though, it's always the people that I sort of let in the most that I lose touch with. My  urlLink Trillian  program logs most of my chats online, and like of the 25 people that I talk to the most... 2 are people that I no longer talk to at all (one of which is a mutual hatred), 4 are people that I rarely talk to now (for various reasons), and there's one person that I wish wouldn't talk to me. Let's just say the ranks of various people that I don't talk to anymore even when adjust for multiple screen names is... interesting.  *
