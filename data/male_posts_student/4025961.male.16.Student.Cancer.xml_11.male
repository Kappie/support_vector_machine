He's one of my favorite rappers ever since I listenned to him about, what 3-4 years ago. And I was going through a couple of his songs, and when I listenned to this song, I was like, wow, how'd he ride this beat. The beat is crazy tight.  Man, I woke up just now, and I saw someone left me a message with a link,  urlLink http://www.koreus.com/files/200407/buscrash.html  GODDAMN LOOK AT THAT KIDS FOOT  jus playin, that's crazy, that they got a camera in that bus. I dunno, I never take buses cept for back in elementary when we'd go to field trips.  But on the real, I woke up feelin like ass. And morning breathe doesnt help either. Blech, disgusting.
