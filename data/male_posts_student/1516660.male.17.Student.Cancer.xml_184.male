We learnt stem-and-leaf diagrams and interests (simple and compound). After that eventful lesson, we went to the hall to celebrate our graduation.  Wee! It's quite fun you know! The teachers are really caring...they planned all these for us! Meow meow! I loved it most when Janet read out the thanks to teachers. It's touching. Uhm-hmm! The teachers from YJC came too. You can say I am quite tempted to join YJC. They offer flexible subject combinations. YaY! I need not be tied down by C-Maths. Meow meow! I am so considering. Note that this is so different from PSLE  After the celebration, we went to eat buffet. Buffet was okay...but everything was so spicy...so hot hot hot! After that, we rushed up to take the SS Mock Exam. Can see that Mrs Jail was dissappointed at the low attendance. I was there. I didn't dissappoint her. The mock exam was quite easy.....yep!! Meow meow! After that, went down to meet Ah Ji...he waited for us! How meowful! Then, I went home with Gloria and CQ.   Hmmm....today leh, Wendy gave me my graduation present from her. She told me that she gave me the last, coz she knew I would open it when I get it. However, surprisingly, I didn't. HaHa! Maybe because this is a very private letter and I don't want people at the back looking at what shouldn't be looked at (:P! I value my privacy, ya know). So, I waited till reaching home to open. Then, upon reaching home, I did NOT open the present. Surpirsing, isn't it? The curious cat supressed his curiosity. HaHa....I want to read the letter in front of Wendy tomorrow ma. Want her to see my reaction. But leh, she insisted on me NOT doing it that way. So, respecting her wishes (ayiah...she feels embarassed ma... :P), I read the letter. And you know what? The letter is the sweetest thing a friend ever did to me. :) Seriously! I appreciate your letter a lot, Wendy! Rest assured that I would treasure it forever (you know...would like to keep your card in my treasure box...but it's too small! haha!). I am NOT gonna lose the letter. Noperino! :) And you know what, Wendy? Friends forever too. :D  Alright! I gotta go sleep le. Gotta wake up quite early. We are going to PJC's Open House tomorrow. Meow meow!! See ya tomorrow, blog! Night!
