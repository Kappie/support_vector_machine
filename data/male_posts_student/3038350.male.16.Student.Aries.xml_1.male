Carolyn spend the night.. we had LOTS of fun.. I got some pictures but not sure how to add them here.. Oh BTW me Carolyn and Debbie went to the new chinese resturante at the clearview.. so not worth it.. Cranbury is soo much better!!!   On Tuesday Carolyn went home.. and I didnt really do anything that I can remember...  On Wednesday I went to work and I put in 6 hours. came home at 3 and then I dont really remember what I did after that..  On Thursday I was supposed to go to Carolyn's because she was having a yard sale but it ended up just being Friday that she had that. so I didnt do anything important.  On Friday.. I didnt do anything.. until Ed and Cyndi came over. that was a lot of fun we watched Coyote Ugly and then Cyndi had to go home and be at work really early so we had to part so sad!!! but I really thanked Cyndi fro bringing him.  On Saturday it was an AWESOME day.  First I got to Roo sit all day that was soo much fun getting to play with Danny Roo all day and I got pictures of that too.. I wish I could download to put them on here that would be really awesome.. anyways the second best part of the day was when my boss Sheri asked me if on Sunday I wanted to go in early to work.. I wasnt sure what she meant.. then she told me that she was short handed in the park and wanted me to come in and work out in the park for the morning before the park opened.. so I was soo excited she told me that I was going to bottle feed all the babies... so then I went home and got ready for Deidra's party.. I was sitting there and then gramma was like Donna, why didnt you bring Ed with you? and I was like well it wasnt my party and I wouldnt feel right inviting someone to a party that isnt mine. and she told me that it was ok.. then like 5 minutes later Cyndi pulled up and I got all excited because my favorite cuzin got here and I ran over to see her and then right as I got to the car I see Ed pop out.. OMG I jumped up and down and was soo excited.. then to top it off he got me a ROSE!!! it was soo beautiful.  (it is haning in my room right now.. upside down so it dries out and will last forever) then me and Ed went for a walk down to the armory and stuff and talked and had a blast and on the way back we was standing there with Cyndi, Linda, their mom and Cody and his mom. and we all started to throw rocks at the poles and the Charles sign... we were having a lot of fun and then we got back to the house and then I was sitting there and mom called me over and I fell on my ass.. that was really funny.. everyone that saw me laughed.. I did too it was HELLA funny.. I did it in slow motion too hehe! then he had to go b/c Cyndi was not feeling well and then we all went home and that was just a great day!!!  On Sunday I got up early and I went to work. I got to feed 4 baby pigs that were 3 days old (at that time) 3 white and 1 black.. I named the black one George! and I got to Roo sit again all day.. anyways then I had to feed Disco the llama and Candice the black sheep and then I had to feed 2 baby cows and 3 baby sheep and goats.. and then it was time to clean up and start the gift shop before it opened.. I opened the gates and the park opens at 10:00 and no one came until 10:30 and I let the first people in and the one lady came back and was like I think something is wrong with your one llama.. so I ran out to see what was wrong with it.. and she had a baby right there.. I got to see the last half of it.. we found out it was a boy and named him Dino so now we have Disco and Dino.. well I got to take care of the baby pigs all day and I got to take care of Danny Roo.. and then it was time for me to go home but I had MAJOR cramps and so it was an ok day.. the park was fun tho.. Sheri said I get to go in the park like 2-3 days a week now.. YAY! so I went home and I laid down and didnt do too much of anything. Oh I forgot that I went to Jess's graduation party.. that was fun NOT!!! I was not feeling well cuz of my cramps and I was trying to talk to Sharon (Jess's mom) and her one friend was being really snooty and I am not going to say what she said to me.. it was really mean and it really hurt me but she is right so I guess it shouldnt matter.. cuz I know that the truth hurts.. then I called home cuz I was really sick and needed to go home so Jenni-fer and Danielle came and got me and they dropped me off and they went to the mall in Ohio  On Monday I wanted to sleep in but I still woke up early.  I was going to go get my permit today and go close my account at the bank and stuff.. but what ended up happening was.. Jenni-fer came and got me and Danielle.. we went to Groves City to find my bank it took us an hour to get to it.. and then we closed it and we went and picked up Shannon and then we went to the mall in Ohio.. Danielle bought a bathing suit.. and I bought a few things that I am not going to say on here lol :P and then we went to Chick-fil-a and ate and it was going to rain so we ran out to the car in the POURING down rain and came home.. and then I got on the computer and talked to Ed and Cyndi and stuff.. Cyndi was having a really bad few days so she came over to hang out with me for awhile.. and then we watched Sleepy Hollow.. she never seen it and then she went home around 1:45. and then I fell asleep.  I woke up this morning and we went to get my film developed and to get my permit.. and then we went out for lunch at Valley Dairy. I got french toast with whip cream and strawberries.. we went to Bilo and got a few things and then we came home and then I cut the grass and we ran out of the string stuff for the weed wacker so I stopped and came back in here and now I am writing this REALLY REALLY long blog hehe.. well I will write again SOON I promsie.. ~Donna~
