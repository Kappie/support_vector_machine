Imagine you're about 3 years old and you're playing in a park, when suddenly this fat kid comes over and throws sand in your eyes.  Alright, now let's say the fat kid's name was Jehovah, and replace the sand with witnesses.  A couple weeks back some  j-ho's  came to my door.  Two young men fully dressed in ties, suits, and fancy black shoes.  There's one thing they forgot to wear: an I.Q..  I quickly said, "Oh, you're not Jehovah's witnesses are you?!"  They barely responded, just kind of walked away.  Score one for not enforcing religion!  Now today, on this wonderful Mothers' Day, big fat Jehovah decided to send  two  very attractive female  pornstars  witnesses to my house.  Radical!  How do you tell a pornstar to get the hell away from your house without going impotent?  It went something like this:  Pornstars:   "Hello, we're doing a something something for  better living ."  Me:             "Better living?  It says Watchtower, so aren't you Jehovah's witnesses?"  Pornstars:   "Well yes but..."  Me:             "I'm pretty busy right now actually."  Pornstars:   "Oh, well then let us give you this handy dandy guide to our cult, so that instead of spending Mothers' Day with your Mom, you can sit alone in your room and read it.  Everyone's doing it, it's all the rage, homeboy."  Me:             "I am  actually  going to kill you."  Pornstars:   "Eat my shit, clear thinking child!" We then began to throw fecal matter at each other but Jehovah's witnesses are incapable of anything other than looking stupid, so imagine if you will two ladies in suits on my front lawn trying to pick up feces with their wrists, while yelling, "Ahhh me so stupid can't get poopie throw at boy."    Okay  , so it didn't go exactly like that.  Use your imagination, people, you get the point though.  I can't make Jehovah's witnesses look any stupider than they already are.  So, in conclusion, next time you see one scream, "Eat my crap, you pornstars from hell!"  Then throw some poop at them even if they don't immediately react, trust me they know what you're talking about, they'll get it.  Hugs not drugs, Sean
