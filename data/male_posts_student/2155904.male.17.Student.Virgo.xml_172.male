Sure Tyke had to write 4 essays in 3rd period but it wasn't like he took them seriously.  The teacher basically said she wasn't going to read them so it's not like they matter.  1st period was fun even though the substitute was a total psycho bitch.  She kept coming around and telling everyone they should be working on math.  She repeatedly told Tyke's table to be working on math but they didn't care.  Tyke does not care about math one bit.  Just wants to keep a C in there cuz it isn't horrible.  He doesn't try at all though.  5th period was fun thats for sure.  Tyke came in and got what he had wished for, a substitute.  He stayed in a few minutes waiting to make his move to leave the class but he finally just decided to walk out right in front of the teacher.  He didn't even notice.  He texted Purdy to see if she was free to hang out for a little cuz he knew she wasn't going to much of 5th period either but she was busy.  And since Tyke's mom was working from home today he couldn't go home so he was a little bit bummed but not really.  He walked past Ritzer's class and waved to some people but then Piggy J came out and they walked around together.  As they were about to go back to Ritzer's Tyke decided to just go in there with Piggy since he had a sub as well.  So he went in and the sub didn't even notice that Tyke wasn't a student in the class so he just chatted it up with Skippy and Maniak and others.  It was fun.  They played some pokerroom and then began to play bball as well.  Those were some heated games.  After a while class was over and they all left.  Tyke went home and played a very aggressive game of ESPN between the 'Nics and Lakers.  'Nics won of course to move to 30-0.  Then Tyke had teriyaki for dinner and tried to print off some english hw he spent forever doing but the printer was extremely gay and Tyke had to work to troubleshoot the problem.  It took about 20 minutes to print off 2 things.  That was just gay.  Unfortunately Tyke hasn't had much that is super bloggy in his life since the Newport incident really.  That is perfect blog material.  Other than that though he has had stuff he wants to but shouldn't talk about or just stuff that isn't entertaining.  So that's gay.  Speaking of gay, Tyke and Kinker talked about how there are a lot of things in Tyke's life that sound like they could be gay (that may have come out wrong but it is true).  Tyke realized that his style is to write in a quasi-confusing manner that is full of inside jokes and stupid comments.  But that is Tyke anyway.  Funny but stupid.
