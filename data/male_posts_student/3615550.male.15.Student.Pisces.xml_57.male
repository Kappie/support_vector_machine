Would you believe I was playing tennis the whole time?  #2:  Uh, I think the publishing interface has changed for Blogger.  I like it so far, but I haven't checked it out completely.  #3:  Okay, I can't think of a number three...  Now, about the F Scale.  The F Scale is basically a way to "yield an estimate of fascist receptivity at the personality level."  Considering my name, I figured this would be a good way to see if I have any fascist tendencies.  As it turns out, I scored a 4.03, a perfectly average number.  I am  "...disciplined but tolerant; a true American."    If I am conservative, and if I am also average, that completely blows the "right-wing extremist," "intolerant fundamentalist," and "out of the mainstream" arguments out of the water.  Technically, those who call us conservatives "fascists" are the ones who are not only out of the mainstream, but also quite ignorant.  They have no clue of what the fascists actually stood for, and so they choose to draw a comparison between two unlike groups (American conservatives and fascist bigots).    In order to see what you rank on the F Scale, click here--uh, okay, so I just realized that I can't make a link right now.  Instead, go to http://www.anesi.com/fscale.htm .  Then take the quiz.  I sort of miss the "preview" and "add link" features.  I hope they are added again soon.
