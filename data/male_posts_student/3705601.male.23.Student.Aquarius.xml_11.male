No one group has influenced more musicians than Canadian supergroup, Rush. Despite a relatively small following and little exposure outside of Canada, many musicians and music insiders respect the power trio's keen sense of musicianship. I am, indeed, one of the few musicians (or musicians in training) that love and respect respect this relatively little-known progressive rock group from Ontario, Canada. I am absolutely sure that I am not the only musician that Rush's music has touched. In their 30-year career (they are celebrating their 30th anniversary with a tour of North America, Canada and Europe), Rush has touched many musicians and fans alike with their music.    I have just recently discovered a rare tribute to Rush in the from of a CD from Magna Carta records. I realize that the CD was produced and released in 1996, but no one seems to know about it and it is very hard to find. This CD, titled "Working Man", puts together many of today's prolific rock musicians to pay tribute to arguably, ther greatest rock band of all time. Musicians like Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy, James LaBrie, and John Petrucci to former Skid Row singer Sebastian Bach. The contents of the CD does do justice to Rush's original versions, but also allows the musicians to add their own touches to the music, which actually complements the songs. Although Geddy Lee's high pitched voice, that was the Rush's signature during their first few records, cannot be imitated (in fact, I have reason to believe that even Geddy couldn't get that high anymore), many of the singers who have lent their voices to the album where able to make thier voices fit. In fact, some singers voices just fit the song very well. The rendition of "Mission" (originally from "Hold Your Fire") was an example of how the singer absolutely fit the song. The singer was Eric Martin of Mr. Big, and honestly when I first heard it, I thought it was a woman singing, but after a while, I realized it was just Eric and it sounded great. Better than any song in the CD, in my humble opinion, but this isn't a knock to the other artists who played on the other songs on the CD. Eric Martin's vocals on "Mission" was just really pretty. James LaBrie of Dream Theater also deserves mention, for he added great vocals to "By-Tor And The Snow Dog" (from Rush' "Fly By Night") and "Red Barchetta" (originally from "Moving Pictures"), as well as Sebastian Bach for "Working Man" (originally from "Rush"). As a bass player, I was absolutely overjoyed to hear Billy Sheehan and Stu Hamm on the album. They really showed us why they are among the great bass players of our time, as well as paying tribute to another one of the greats, Geddy Lee.    For a casual Rush fan, this is a great tribute album that will make you appreciate Rush for reasons that weren't there before. It will cause you to be a die-hard Rush fan and make you want to buy all of their records. For a die-hard Rush fanatic such as myself, this album rocks and it doesn't tarnish Rush's integrity or butcher their music at all. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested. It is a great buy!
