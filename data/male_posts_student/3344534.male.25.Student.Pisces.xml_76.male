"Bush would be more decisive." excerpted from this  urlLink article .  ????  what?  just because a person is decisive is not a reason he/she should be president.  i know the quote was just a clip and all, and could very well be taken out of a larger well thought out argument... but if the ONLY reason this woman thinks bush would make a good president is that he SEEMS to be more decisive... then it's a terrible argument.  people can be decisive and make bad decisions... which i think the bush administration has plenty of them.  being president REQUIRES a person and their administration to make the BEST decision in the face of ALL information gathered.  being president REQUIRES that person's administration to check and thoroughly recheck information to make sure it's right, and after that point make the BEST decision.  the fed are not going to move on interest rates unless they have jobs, unemployment, gdp, trade, cpi, ppi, etc., stats.  if we do all of that for money, shouldn't we get the best and most correct data for something like a military campaign when the lives of our fellow americans are on the line?  obviously the length of time a decision will be made on certain issues will vary from person to person... but the important point is that we make the BEST decision... sure... it's a judgement call... but what i'm trying to get across is... rash decisions are not the same as good decisions.  kerry WILL have to make decisions as president... i don't think kerry will make as many quick decisions as bush, but why is that bad if they're the CORRECT (read best) ones?   "I'm not going to be satisfied until everybody who wants to work can find a job," Bush told cheering supporters at a picnic in New Hampshire. taken from this  urlLink article .  well then i guess bush will NEVER be satisfied.  no matter how hard anyone tries, there will never be 100% employment... i guess not unless we move to a complete command economy (aka communism and various forms of socialism).  there will always be people that can't find jobs in a capitalist market.  even if everyone did have a job... yes... i feel like i'm beating the type of job issue to death... but if you were making $40k/year as a business analyst, were laid off, continued to want a job as an analyst, but you end up being a grocery bagger for minimum wage (ie you still WANT a job)... is that acceptable?  global trade... free trade is NOT bad.  the  urlLink wto  is NOT bad.  there are things that might be wrong with the system, but conceptually... why is it bad to get things cheaper?  why do americans LOVE shopping @ wal-mart and yet they'll (people other than the workers.  ie people with 2nd hand experience) protest wages that wal-mart pays the workers?  simple business sense would dictate that the more costs you have... the more you'll have to find a way somehow to cover them.  being that wage costs are the main costs to a retail business that are self-adjustable... if wages go up, something has to make up for it on the revenue side.  the major revenue variable revenue stream is product pricing... thus prices for items would need to go up.  in the case of US farming... i think our subsidies for farmers are way too much.  why subsidize for a system that overproduces by so much?  our supply greatly exceeds the demand for farm products... which means the price should be very low for us right?  unfortunately the government props up these industries by installing a price floor, so not only do we as consumers pay more than we have to... we pay for product that we don't even consume (at the supermarket checkout and through taxes).  why the waste?  why can't we return the market to equilibrium naturally?  why can't we use tax dollars for something more productive like education credits for farmers whose farms would fold if we did set that industry free?  in the long run... that would benefit more.  or... another way to think of it... if you're a farmer (i know in my head farming is difficult work... not first hand... but i know it's more difficult than what most people imagine) and you work your farm 24x7 putting in those long days... and in the end the product of your work is not being used up... but instead wasted... what does that say about the time you put into producing that product?  from a personal perspective... is it time well spent?  we are a nation of over-producers and over-consumers... we have that luxury... but we waste SO much... and we overpay for waste.  i wish our politicians would stand up against waste more than anything else... i think in the end... a lot of problems domestically and internationally that we face stem from us over-consuming and wasting things.  jetblue is  urlLink awesome .  i'm glad they're growing and doing well.  they're planes are comfortable, their service is exceptional, and their prices are cheap.  i lucked out when they first launched... as the new york-buffalo route was an initial route... for a few months they had i think like $25-$30 one-way fares on the route.  $50-$60 roundtrip... i was so on that... especially being a poor college student.  within the last year or so... they reconfigured their planes to give you extra legroom in the rear plane seats.  people in the rear are usually the last ones to get off.  this makes sense i think... cause sometimes in the past i'd be disappointed if i didn't get a seat in the front of the plane... but if i had extra legroom... that's something i can at least take comfort in that the front seated people didn't have (frickin jerks).  i try to get seats mid-plane now... legroom  decent deboarding time... nice compromise.  brett hull (the non-goal scorer) signed with  urlLink phoenix ...  Hull, drafted by Calgary in the sixth round in 1984, has played for the Flames, St. Louis, Dallas and Detroit. He won Stanley Cups with the Stars (1999) and Red Wings (2002), scoring the cup-winning goal for Dallas in a triple-overtime Game 6 victory against Buffalo. WHAT?!  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! (think of the 'NOOO!' from mcbain on the simpsons).  the article forgot to add that his skate was in the crease... thus technically nullifying the goal because of the RULES of the game at that time, which promptly were changed the next season.  you know... that was perhaps the best game-winning NON-goal that i've ever seen.  das war eine grosse hasselhoff... eine grosse scheisse.  das ist alles fuer jetzt...
