He seems nice enough, just a little talkative. After English I went home and cleaned my room/bathroom and took a shower. Then Mark and I went to my ( . . . ?) Nina's house to give her a bunch of shirts that Donna had asked me to drop off for her brother-in-law. While we were there we decided to pick up a few jigsaw puzzles because she is the queen of them. When I asked her if we could take two or three she said "Take ten!" so we took 15. That should keep us busy. After Nina's house we went to El Superior to eat cheese enchiladas for lunch. For 15 minutes we were the only people in the entire restaurant. It was really cool. I feel guilty for leaving so much queso left in the bowl. It was so delicious. We walked over to the Pet Shop to look at fish and aquariums because I'm going to buy one soon. Mark pet this hairy pig-dog thing almost the entire time because if he stopped it would bark at him. We went to his house and worked on  urlLink our website  for a few hours. And then we drove to my dad's house. We ate dinner and watched Vegas Vacation. I'll let Mark take it from here.
