TWO - cause for celebration *wastes rest of week* crap.. there goes all my hard work...)   Ehheh... hopefully that won't happen... but  anyways ... the second thing that was quite interesting that happened today was that the number of people helping out for the japanese pavilion just tripled...where did all these people come from? ^^;; More people... more PAWA....so oh well.   Well.. last thing was course selection... and do i have a lot to go through or what... ah well, the top 5 right now are: the 3 sciences, Computers, and Media Arts. Media Arts being the funnest.   Ah.. hafta go to library... Song of the Lionness awaits..^^;; and so does "The Swiftly Tilting Planet".     *Later that day*     I must be really messed up these days... when I got my shoes to go to the library... I picked up  dress  shoes... then i was like "what the heck am I doing?".. and just yesterday.. after taking a shower, it was cold and I wanted to wear a sweater... I wore a sweater and it wasn't till I went to bed that I found out I was wearing my school uniform sweater... I was like "wha...?" and no one seemed to notice either.. maybe we're all tired and messed.   Ah... did I say Swiftly Tilting Planet? I meant Wind in the Door...^^;; The second book in the series in any case...spent most of the night reading the first book of Song of the Lionness... really interesting so far. Seems like a hybrid of Mulan and Sword in the Stone.    ~Chronos
