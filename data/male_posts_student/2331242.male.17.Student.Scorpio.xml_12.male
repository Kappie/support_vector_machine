All you need to know is that now *cue James Brown* I feel good.  Let's do another rundown, shall we?   THE ENGLISH EXAM  I bombed, mostly due to my own laziness. I couldn't even answer the most basic questions, as was to be expected considering that I (once again) have not read anywhere near half of the assigned reading.   THE MATH EXAM  Ditto, except for the part about laziness. I try hard in that class, I really do... this year though, I just don't get it. Allow me to explain with the poem I wrote for extra credit (he basically gave us 6 freebie points at the end of the exam).   There once was a teacher named Bach, who's style of teaching plain rocked, But I just don't get it... I hate to admit it, But on this exam I just flopped!   OK, so the part about my teacher was totally inacurate, but a little brown-nosing was in order. I do want to graduate after all. I wish we would practice each individual concept more than once. He blazes through it in class, we stumble through the homework, and then we move on. I feared that the day of reckoning was at hand, and boy was I right. Well... fuck it.   I DON'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE  The following rant is a must have for any blog, and I felt like I had reached a few conclusions on the matter. First there are two people that I know at my school that are afflicted with "severe fitting-in syndrome" (yeah, so I just made that name up right now). I have never seen, let's just call them X and Y, these persons' true personalities. X conforms his interests to those around him. He'll never disagree with you, and is always desperately trying to win your favor. It's repulsive. Y is much the same, he'll lie (big hint people, lying is not a good way to make a friendship grow) about different cool stuff he has, about achievements he has made in my areas of interest, just so I will like him. Come on people.... WHY CAN'T YOU BE YOURSELF? More on that later.... Then there's subject Z, a girl at my church who is so desperately attatched to the fact that "she is not cool" that it's just plain depressing to be around her. I mean, I'm happily chatting with my brother and two of his friends while playing a game of cards on this youth retreat a couple of months ago, and she just wanders in and says in a "woe is me" type of tone, "Oh, I hate my life, when will it ever end..." Dear subject Z, it's not  you  that pushes people away, it's your damn 24/7 aura of miserable depression!!!!!!  Now, heed my words of advice, all you insecure teenagers trying to find your place in the world.  The moment you stop believing in a system of cool vs. uncool, popular vs. unpopular and BE YOURSELF, your teen angst will be instantly cut in half (the other half being that of school, sex, and drugs). What I admire in a person and look for in a friend, as do most content young adults, is a confident and unique individual. What I don't like is a person who's always trying to fit in. Desparation, my good friends, is a turn off. Be confident, be an individual, and be  alive .   *phew* Wow, that really needed to be said. Moving right along...   MORE MARTHA GOODNESS  I spent tonight with my awesome girlfriend studying for meteorology. After the math exam, we went back to my house and got about half way through the semester. At 6:30, my family had to play some brass quartet pieces at church, which was a big success. Martha came and watched, and apparently, was quite charmed. Afterwards, I drove her back to Lindsey's house and we cuddled up on the couch and got through the rest of our material. We both laughed at her failed and successful attempts to make up answers on her tests, and her funky grammar. I annhialated the pop-up ads on her computer, which was easy but still got me plenty of gratitude (hooray!) including a kiss or two from Martha. I could have kissed her all night...   COME BACK DOWN TO EARTH, LOVER BOY  Meteorology exam tomorrow. While everyone else in the school is going to be panicking about physics, biology, or chemistry, Martha and I are just gonna quiz eachother for a few minutes and enjoy eachother's company :) Right now, I'm gonna get a good night's sleep, and prepare myself for a kick-ass day tomorrow.   Adios, mi gente!
