However, the bio is unfinished, and I don't feel much like writing any more tonight. Just wanted to blog before heading to bed.  It's almost November 1st. November 1st is a very solemn day in my life. I have been thinking of Allison often lately, but I dont' know if it has anything to do with the upcoming anniversary of her death, or something a little more than that. No matter. People get taken away from us, and then they're gone. No matter how much you cry or mourn or wallow, they aren't coming back. It's even more depressing when you don't believe in a God or an afterlife. I'm not going to deny that it's a horrible way to live, thinking that once you die, that's it. There's nothing. I sincerely hope I'm wrong about this one.  Hope is all we have sometimes.
