Bush  recently met  Roland Martin  in Crawford, Texas, where the two  urlLink filmed a  Fishing With Roland Martin  special  to help  Bush's  reelection bid. The show aired on the  Outdoor Life Network  on Friday, and encore runs will play this Wednesday and Thursday (6:30 EDT).  "The number of folks that fish is off the chart," said  Martin  of  Bush's  appearance, pushing the idea that  Bush's  televised role as a fisherman may contribute some needed votes come November.  Bush , who showed up with his Scottish terrier  Barney , refrained from political talk for the entire taping, again looking like your average father figure out to relax and catch bass.  Traditional baits, hooks, and tackle were the audience to  Bush's  storytelling, as he reminisced on pasttimes he spent with his family out on the lake. After sitting in on  ESPN  broadcasts and throwing first pitches at  Yankee  games, this stunt seems pretty tame for the  President . Actually, after demonstrating his fishing rod skills, the  Pres  commented that he did the show "just to prove that  John Kerry  isn't the only candidate who can get a hook up."  00000000
