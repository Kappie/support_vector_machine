I am trying to apply finishing strokes to my research work; two words that I somehow never came to  terms  with (is this a good pun or is it just me?). Ofcourse, I am also into one of those voraciously-devouring-book-worm phases of my life-cycle. My topic of reading at present is rock music, something which does not deserve any special mention on my already rocking musical abode.  But just so you know, I finished reading this book called  Seventies Rock: A Decade of Creative Chaos . Nice book to keep yourself busy, if you are a jobless soul (thanks to  urlLink Katt , been searching for the right words to describe myself) on a pleasant and refreshing friday night. Chronicles all those glory years, stretching from the early trippy, slam-bang days of Jimi Hendrix right upto the emergence of punk rock in the form of The Sex Pistols and Clash by the end of the 70s. It's timepass, basically. The biggest disappointment for me was Frank Moriarty's (the author) failure to mention  anything  about Dire Straits. How can someone forget Sultans of Swing and Mark Knopfler's cleanest Fender Stratocaster of 1978, at a time when punk rock was stealing the show from the classic blues rockers? Not having Straits' name anywhere inside a 300 page book depicting 70s rock is sheer crime. Even though the book is supposedly personal (which book is not?), it potrays all the big and small bands of that era, except Straits. The fact that Frank is not biased in his writings nor in his taste for British or the American genre of rock, calls for even more surprise as to why Straits/MK didn't deserve even a side-note in the appendix, forget a noteworthy praise or two in the main chapters. Actually, I figured Frank delves too much on the punk scene, one reason why he probably forgot that Sultans not only brought back the fresh blues rock years, but also the art of air-guitaring to solos, on the fender. Plus, he seems to be a huge fan of The Who and David Bowie, both getting ample coverage in the book, almost in every chapter. I haven't heard their music, but if you have and don't happen to be a fan, watch out.  Man, I feel for Knopfler! By the way, I am keeping my ears open for his new  urlLink solo album  releasing in September.  My next reading session will feature a book called  Rock and Roll Music: A Social History,  which presumably contains more subtle, thoughtful and well-researched material. Pretty soon, I plan to move onto the biographies of Led Zepp and Jethro Tull. Great, great bands. Should make for interesting reading.  Not too bad a friday night, was it?
