It also made me think a bit about this music piracy issue and why it's such a problem.  iTunes has helped to legitamise music downloads in a big way; it currently holds about 70% of the market and will probably stay there for a while. Before iTunes, almost 99% of music downloads were illegal and it's easy to see why. Music is expensive - especially in the UK - so if you can get it free easily, why not? Morals aside, anyone can grab the music they want, hassle and cost free.  Yet from personal experience and a bit of guesswork, I think I can say that a factor of equal importantce to price is the ability to try before you buy. Go into a shop like HMV and there are thousands and thousands of CDs. They all cost about £15 and you have to choose one that you think you might like. If you haven't heard it on the radio or at a friend's house, then it's just lucky if you get something you like. I wouldn't bet £15 with those odds.  When you download music illegally, if you don't like it then you loose nothing because you didn't pay for it. But if you could try it before you buy it, then you'd probably be happy to pay. I would.  iTunes lets you do exactly that - you can listen to a 30 second extract of any song before you purchase it. What's more is that the prices are reasonable, at 99p or 99c per track. The UK pricing isn't as cheap as I'd like - 70p would be better - but it's still far cheaper than highstreet shops. When the Music Store comes online, I'll be ditching illegal downloads and will use iTunes instead because the risk of not gettign what you pay for - good music that you like - is far less. If iTunes is a bit pricy, I'll preview music on there and then buy the actual CD on Amazon. Simple, cheap and risk free.  ***  Back in the world of exams, bathrooms and stuff, my Pure Maths exam is tomorrow, which is probably the scariest of the lot. Today I got up extra early (6.30am!!!) to go and have a shower at someone else's house and have spent the rest of the morning really in denial about the work I have to do. It's just too sunny to work, too boring for me to revise and I'm too hungry to move! Argh, I can't wait 'til this is all over!
