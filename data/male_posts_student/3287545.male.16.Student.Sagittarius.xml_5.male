God, I love him so much. We sat next to each other on the minibus. Imagine, both of us wearing shorts in a crampt minibus, there was just a little bit of leg touching/rubbing. Sighhhh. So we were at the center thing and we kinda hung out which was cool. And then when we came back to school we walked down together to Robinsons where I was meeting mum, although Katie tagged along for a little bit of the way, which wasn’t to good. Cause I spend all that time being all gay with arron, and then I had to hold her hand and kiss her. Yesterday we all left the youth club early and we sat down on the grass square thing which was fantastic. I felt very nice to be out in the sun with my friends. I made myself a daisy chain bracelet, and of course everyone was making comments, gay ones, which I was lovin. Katie has stopped phoning me now, which although I like, I know the reason she’s doing it. It’s an attempt to piss me off, she’s playing hard to get I think. She thinks I like our phone conversations, and therefore expects me to phone her, but I don’t so I wont. I guess I’m playing hard to get as well. But only one of us can do this, you can’t have to people going in the opposite direction. For a successfully relationship both parties should come together. Katies going inwards for us to meet in the middle but I haven’t gone in because the stuff inside really doesn’t appeal to me. So she’s chasing me and I’ve just jumped in a car and sped off into the horizon. She’s given up and walked back out to try and gult me into coming back.
