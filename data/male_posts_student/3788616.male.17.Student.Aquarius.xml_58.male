Certainly, i am not playing my best, but... nevertheless, it's still highly disappointing at times don't you think?! Anyway, so, ok... only good thing to note, i played better during the 5 on 5 full court game... yup, made a great 3 point shot when i was being blocked and it kind of was a fade away lah... so, the rest of the team clapped for me, was pretty pleased about it... but... coming and crashing back to earth is my darn injuries, i think i really should stop for a while! it ain't helping! Considering that everytime i spped up or force myself even more, the back strains and screams in pain like hell! crap lah...  Anyway, another problem is that of... i have so many friends that are facing love and relationship problems, won't mention names... but, i really sympathise with damn, cause ultimately, i guess, i've been through most of those problems that they are facing... but, anyway, to all those friends that are facing problems, trust me, everything will turn out fine... certainly, it may not turn out the way you want, but, in the end, things happen cause it's part of GOD's plan... so, yeah... don't let it get you down! Cheer up and smile! :p  Ok... here's the thing that is really bothering me! i was really in a conflict during training just now... Kelly got cramps, and when i saw that, i really wanted to go rush and help her out, indeed we were like talking, shooting and discussing stuff... but, who cares about them lah?! i don't know, on one hand, i really wanted to run to her side and help her in anyway that i can... on the other, i didn't want everybody to know and than start jacking her about me... but whatever it is, i was really glad when the coach went to help her! Kelly, i sure hope that you are ok yeah... do take care of yourself, if you need anything, just tell me yeah...  Ooh! i saw my cousin, Hannah today lah! and of course, as usual, weird looks came my way when i was sitting and walking around school with her... oh well... Take care people! keep smiling and cheer up! :p
