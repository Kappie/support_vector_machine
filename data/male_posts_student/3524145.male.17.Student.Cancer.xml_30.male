Nowadays ... studies and projects are all coming out... i just seems so slack ... not doing everything... am i just lazy in nature? i duno... just seems to far... i am suppose to be well organise and well prepared in all the things i do with Him in my life... but i just dun seems to be following Him well... i am not walking well in the path... i am not well ... i am not running well in the race... i really wonder ... if i am not running well... i will be causing my whole team to fall... but how can i do that? i really dun understand what am i think... haiz... thinking lots of things.... just seems to be tired everyday... i guess i am just doing too much... many times i guess its better to stand alone... being alone quietly sometimes really is such a peace... there wun be headache... but i hate the loneliness... i dunno ... can someone bring me back? i think i have been dazing around everyday... seems to be in dream land everyday... hrm... got a feeling that i am getting sick real soon... having flu... having headache... gonna have a fever soon... hrm...   Am i always trying to get things done fast... theres lots of things that cannot be rushed... i think i am getting more and more insensitive... i think i have changed alot... i really start to get sick of Poly life... its tough ... really tough mental... not about Intelligence... but about Socialogy... hrm... maybe no one understand me... beside Father up there in heaven... or am i just thinking too complicated... seems to have lots of things that i have to let go... let go ... let go....   Nowadays... i just dun seems to feel my heart.. i dunno my own heart beat... i dunnno where have it flown to... haiz...
