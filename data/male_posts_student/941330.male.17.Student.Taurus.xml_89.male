WTF! if it's a fake, it's a pretty good one, cuz he seemed to be really offended at what i said. but how could he find my blog? it's...obscure as hell...if it's really him, then hey i know some things about your campaign...i heard about the threat  from a councilwoman? about you costing the city so much money to run, but then somebody else joined so that point is moot. you have an honorable standpoint from which to run, but i think it isn't worth the effort and money to run just for principle -- and besides, you've got uc davis to worry about. just my opinion, but if you want to open the public's eyes to that sort of thing, you could try a newsletter, a letter to the editor, a flyer campaign...use the recall instead of a comparatively obscure and expensive school council election campaign to further your cause. of course, all this is pointless if you aren't really kevin bella, but it does seem you are. and thank you for commenting, that's really cool of you to do so.  edit 12:08 AM: I just realized that since Google bought Blogger, maybe blogs will go on search results. Ergo, this (un)lovely site can be found on page 4 for "kevin bella" and page 11 for "most extreme elimination challenge." that's cool...it only took like 10 hours to find me...
