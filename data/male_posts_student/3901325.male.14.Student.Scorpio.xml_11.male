So it's kool yeah and i had to talk to this chick called gessely, this girl i like from last year we had a quick talk about why she ain't call me and she told me her father took her phone away and she forgot my number. So i told her i would give her my number tomorrow and she said ok, now one thing during summer i told her i had to tell her somthing and by now i forgot what i was going to ask her. So i don't know whats going to happen and i'am kind of nervous because i really like this girl i me not like her i love her, and what i feel is true but i think she thinks i'am like all the other guys, and what i mean by that is she thinks guys are asses but i'am not like that she kind of gets the idea that i'am not and her friends know i'am not like the others. Yeah and that was my first day of school.
