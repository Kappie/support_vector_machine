I wonder what guys like that would do if they possessed self-respect, or weren't creating false issues like the "Clintons don't want Kerry to win" stuff...which picks up where their "Bill Clinton is obsessed with his legacy" obsession with Bill Clinton's legacy left off. These are the same people who in high school aspired to be members of the in-crowd, but never quite made it. In their Quixotic opposition to the Clintons, however, they feel as if they can finally have their revenge. There's a saying they may want to consider, though: Once a loser, always a loser. Just something to think about.  Speaking of deficient self-respect: Ralph Nader continues to diminish himself as well, by aiding George Bush's bid for "re"-election. Now that his wings have been so thoroughly clipped by Dems, however, Ralph is actually kind of cute; like a tarantula in a jar. Here's lookin' at you, Nad-boy...to the extent that such can be stomached.  But the real fun, as always, comes from the Republican spin-factory -- which is kind of like Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory, except instead of chocolate they use feces. (And instead of Oompa Loompas, Robert Novak.) The Repugs are banking heavily on the word "liberal" to get them through this election; a word I've now heard slightly less than the eighty-seven-billion, four-hundred trillion times I've heard the phrase: "We know he had weapons of mass destruction. He used them on his people. The previous administration said he had them. The UN said he had them," and so on. And it's just as mind-numbing...though the numbing effect, in this case, is something that will come back to bite them in the ass. (Which, incidentally, is probably the only way the poor bastards will ever have something bite them in the ass.)  The liberal tag has been the cornerstone of conservative attack-politics since Ronald Reagan stigmatized it in the Eighties...and today, they're apparently intent on running it into the ground. Which is appropriate, since the technique is near dead. As a result of their lack of insight, however -- and seeming to sense that liberals are on the verge of removing the stigma altogether -- they have taken a frontal approach, and challenged Kerry and Edwards to embrace the label. "Why don't they just admit they're liberal?" the conservatives taunt. Answer: Because conservatives are doing the leg work of rehabilitating the word for us. Why interrupt a good thing?  Think about it: Kerry and Edwards are going to run away with this election; then remember that the younger generation -- whose lack of memory over Vietnam made them accept lies about Iraq as their first taste of nationalism (and are being convinced to embrace women dying in back alleys because they have no memory of illegal abortions) -- are being told that the soon-to-be-victorious ticket is the embodiment of extreme liberalism. Yet following the election, they will be responsible for returning honor and prosperity to our country. Then think about whether Kerry/Edwards should embrace the phrase now...or if it will be more fun to let conservatives continue to instill the positive connotation themselves.  I've always laughed at the "liberal media" idea -- not just because it's asinine, but because it shows that most people don't know what far-left liberal truly means. If you want to know if Kerry and Edwards are extremist or mainstream, though, ask a Green Party member...then run like hell, unless you want an earful.
