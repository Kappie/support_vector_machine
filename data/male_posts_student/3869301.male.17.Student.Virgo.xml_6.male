After picking up this girl that reminds me of a thinner but less attractive version of "That Bullard Girl" we are off to Chili's. I hate Chili's. I drank too much tea while we were waiting for everyone to get there... Then we rushed off to the concert. I hate Puddle of Mudd, Nickleback, and 3 Doors Down. I don't hate them so much as I hate the people that listen to their music. Smelly, Drunken, Shirtless people. Any way the best part of the concert was the expensive port-a-pottie. It was just like Dale Gribble's on King Of the Hill. I still have the stamp on my hand that lets me back in. It was a one time payment of 5 dollars. It was so worth it after all that tea at Chili's. On the way back I got Amanda her lemonade that she wanted. After she drank it all I dared her to throw the half of lemon that was in her cup. She wouldn't so I did. When I did this guy next to me who probably had about 15 years on me pokes me and shakes his head at me. If it was not for the fact that he was about a foot and a half taller than me I would have punched him in the jaw. That douche has no right to tell me what to and not to throw into the backs of people with better seats than me! After the concert I went to Waffle House with Amanda and that Bullard-like girl. I enjoy waffles, hashbrowns, and coffee in the middle of the night. I drove Amanda's Izuzu Trooper home from there. I really don't care to drive big cars.  Many of you frequent readers might have noticed the name of this blog has changed. I decided last night that while some mainstream rock is okay I don't like the people and the lifestyle that is associated with fans of that genre. I have always hated A, American Eagle, and any other place that sells preppy ragged clothing. I only shop at Hot Topic and stores like that when I feel like spending way too much money on t-shirts. I also hate people that need to be drunk in order to enjoy eachother. I have made up my mind. I think I already am to a certain degree a hipster. I mean, I have never worn something because it is popular. (My Chucks I had before they became as annoyingly mainstream as they are now and I will keep wearing them after their popularity dies down!) I have always enjoyed music for it being kind of an art and have lashed out at those that said that N'Sync and the Spice Girls were artists. They were performers! I still do not feel too much like a hipster though. I am a hipster wantabe.
