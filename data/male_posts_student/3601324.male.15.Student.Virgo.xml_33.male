Well, I  have  been working on a website with Ian. I don't know if that's really going anywhere though. Probably not.  And I'd also like to add that I'm a horrible, horrible person for not updating Oddities enough. I'm horrible at keeping up with projects like that. It's like ADD on a larger scale. But with enough continuous punches from Mr. Catfish and Zefer, I might start getting some stuff up! Keep it coming, guys. The procrastination must come to and end.
