Fuck. I'll be gone for four days so I might as well post anything I've jotted down recently.  --People here at work are talking about camping and how much they like it. They're asking each other stuff like "What do you camp in? Pop-Top? RV?" "No, we're  really   roughing  it. We're  driving  to a  campsite  and sleeping outside in a  nine-person tent "  What the fuck? That shit made my blood boil. Those choads have no fucking clue what "roughing it" really is. What they're doing isn't even camping.... Last time I went "camping" I slept in a fucking minivan because the whole thing was such a joke I didn't want to try fooling myself.  -- Right now Steve Karaszkiewicz is making me look at his Xanga. It's damn near impossible to read because, like everyone else, he has to have a background picture of something that nobody else gives a shit that he's interested in. Why the fuck do people do this? Now if you're a good enough writer that it makes it worth it to struggle through reading your site, that's one thing (still rediculous). But, if you just write like everyone else and you're just going over your boring day-to-day life, just go with the damn default colors.  -- A large group of extremely good-looking South Americans came in to work today. Yesterday one of the most beautiful females I've ever seen came in. She was a mulatto goddess; all the best physical traits of her races, none of the bad, and she looked painfully smart (looked only 18 too). Hopefully I'll be seeing more of her. You know, there are some people who are so beautiful that you are too intimidated to talk to, then there are people like my mulatto goddess who are beyond that to the point that you couldn't imagine NOT talking to them... Eh. I bet she's a total cunt or has no personality though. Fuck 'er.  I got my senior portraits taken today. My dad wouldn't let me pose holding the diploma and giving the finger cause he said someone might bitch about it. On the way out I saw Sam. People used to think I was crazy for having a  thing  for her, now I'll be damned if she isn't the best looking girl at GV (or at least one of them). Apparently I got hot; that's what her face seemed to be telling me. Yeah bitch, I've come a long way from the short, obese, depressed, greazzy little Italian punk I was. She seemed to like what she saw. That kinda made my day (until I got to work. glargh) She looked really great too, which is people are telling me I was right about her looking like an Italian Salma Hayek if she lost weight. Between the two of us, since we stopped talking, I'd say we've probably lost almost 200lbs.  -- It's Cher"ry, not CHAIR-E! Get it fucking right people!  --I didn't get that Bronco. It was just too damn big. V8 5.1 liters, 350 horses, the size of a GMC Jimmy almost (probably wider and higher, but shorter). Probably only got 8mi/gal. Fuck that. I'll probably be getting a Jeep or Ford SUV when I get back from NY on sunday...  -- I realized that most of what I wrote in my notebook is going to be saved for a lengthy, thoughtful, extrospective which I probably wont post because it's going to be about people I don't like, and I'm sure those people read this shitty blog (and would most likely dick me over if I, god forbid, let everyone know what usless, annoying, boring people they were)  See y'all monday    NP: Tower of Power- Down to the Night Club (Bump City), Soul Vaccination
