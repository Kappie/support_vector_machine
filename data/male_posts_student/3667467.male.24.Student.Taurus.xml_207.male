The point of the ad is to show that the good folks at Dell work 24/7 to handle Your Call and help you get on your way. Like all ads, half of it is true. Yes, they're actually quite helpful and polite and whatnot, but there is a glaring error in this one. In the commercial, everyone speaks English! I dare you to call Dell Tech Support and get someone who speaks English as a first language! And after about a month of pondering it, I've finally decided that the people who DO work there in Real Life are all Korean. Why are they all in Nashville? No clue! But it sounds like I keep calling the Wong Family Reunion because they all sound the same, and they're nice as h*ck but NONE of them can get my laptop working. Oy!
