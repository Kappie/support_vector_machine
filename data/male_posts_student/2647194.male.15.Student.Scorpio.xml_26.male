Original cabinet member names and aliases  "Bush=Chief Shrub Condoleeza Rice=Condomleeza Rice (copyright Ian Crinean) Donald Rumsfeld=Donny Rum-filled John Ashcroft=Johnny Asscraft"  2. A wonderful quote from me:  "Condomleeza, Rum-filled, Asscraft-they're all in the same bed together in the White House. I say we torch the joint before the real fucking begins."  3. And the 10 reasons why an azalea bush is better than our Chief Shrub (I did not write this):  1.     An azalea bush doesn’t have a face of stupidity and dullness; a face if seen can make the viewer think “What a bloody moron!” An azalea bush doesn’t even have a face. 2.     An azalea bush can’t speak, so it doesn’t have the ability to testify before a committee; and therefore it cannot tell a lie.  3.     An azalea bush can’t have it’s head up it’s ass while running the country, because a) an azalea bush has no head; b) an azalea bush hasn’t any ass, and c) An azalea bush cannot run the country because it is an inanimate object. 4.     An azalea bush be used as a publicity ploy for a political party because a) an azalea bush cannot be apart of a political party; and b) they haven’t come up with a military flight jacket wearable by your average azalea bush. 5.     An azalea bush can’t avenge their father’s supreme screw-ups with an even bigger screw-up because a) azalea bushes can’t avenge anything; b) azalea bushes don’t have fathers; and c) azalea bushes cannot screw up in the first place, let alone supremely. 6.     An azalea bush can’t screw the entire American populace with their pants on simultaneously. An azalea bush cannot screw anything to begin with; with or without pants on. 7.     An azalea cannot wreck an economy, because a) they can’t order tax cuts; b) they cannot run a budget; and c) they do not hold the nation’s checkbook between their ass cheeks – They have no ass; nor cheeks for said ass, ergo, there is no “between”. 8.     An azalea cannot feed verbal bullshit to the entire nation while being sanctioned by the Electoral College.  9.     An azalea bush cannot speak. 10. An azalea bush doesn’t hold the key to the nukes in a hallowed out copy of “Playboy” that has a cover that reads “500 ways to screw the nation with their pants on.  Thanks to Ian Crinean for coming up with that.  60 Minutes on CBS tonight was classic-Condomleeza dished out the usual bullshit lies, evaded the questions asked of her, and LIED LIED LIED!!!!!  Here's a song that describes our very own Chief Dumbass quite frankly:  "Since I was a child I've tried to be what I'm not I've lied and I've enjoyed it all my life I lied to my dear mother to my sisters and my brother and now I'm lying to my children and my wife Big Hat, no cattle Big head, no brain Big snake, no rattle I forever remain big hat, no cattle I knew from the start Big boat, no paddle Big belly, no heart  Can't remember why I do it, Oh, maybe I can. An honest man these days is hard to find. I only know we're living in an unforgiving land. And a little lie can buy some real big piece of mind.  Oftimes I wondered what might I have become, Had I but buckled down and really tried. But when it came down to the wire I called my family to my side Stood up straight, threw my head back and I lied, lied,lied  Big hat, no cattle Big shoes, well you know... Big horse, no saddle He goes wherever I go  Big hat, no cattle Right from the start Big guns, no battle Big belly, no heart  When it came down to the wire I called my little family to my side Stood up straight, threw my head back and I lied, lied,lied lied, lied, lied  Big hat, no cattle Big head, no brain Big snake, no rattle I forever remain Big hat, no cattle I knew from the start Big boat, no paddle Big belly, no heart Big boat, no paddle Big belly, no heart"
