Only prettier and the nose not like shanning.. LOLX! The malay gerls there are also cool.. HAHA.. During s-league matches the u16 and u18 team will like have to watch the match behind the cheerleaders and almost all of us will not be concentrating on the match.. But the cheers were nonsense.. I cannot tahan..  "Eh ah eh ah tak takot tak takot." "Warriors gina pabeto." haha wad nonsense.. I wanna go shopping later.. I wanna buy a belt and a topshop tee..
