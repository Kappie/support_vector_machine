The amount of damage humans have done, do, and will continue to do to the earth always amazes me. It seems that humans are extremely selfish. If humans continue to plague the earth with pollutants at this rate, it will inevitably lead to destruction of the Earth or the human race, whether it be from depletion of ozone or the melting of the icecaps. It sickens me that although we know this information we continue to pollute and plague the earth.  I also saw the movie Day After Tomorrow and was somewhat dissapointed but it was still an okay movie. I have never really liked Dennis Quaid (I think that is how you spell it), I think he wasn't good for the part. Anyway it's worth the 7.50 to see it. Mr. Parlee is a good teacher. He is very opinionated but, as Ryan and I were talking, we found it somewhat refreshing to hear actual political opinions by someone as educated in history and politics as he is. Usually teachers are hesitant about revealing their opinions because they don't want to offend anyone, but because Mr. Parlee is a substitute he is able to cross those boundries.  Lastly, does anyone know where Clark went? She told us but I forgot.
