Then when I tried to remember why it was I left the computer, I couldn't, for the life of me, recall why it was. (on a side note, I just now remembered why). Earlier, we were having a conversation, my family, and when we paused, I couldn't remember what I wanted to say just a minute or so earlier. I can foresee this as a major problem in my adult life. Also, I'm afraid of spiders. Not deathly so, just don't like 'em. They've bitten me in my sleep, and that I don't mind so much, but if they ever tried that shit while I was awake, I would be all up on that bitch! lol *sad attempt at ebonics*. Anyways, I was going to write about my drawing skill envy problem then cleverly segueway (or, you know, just rant until I ended up on the subject) into how I miss the extinct snacks I used to eat/drink as a child like Squeezits or Gobble Stix, but now I'm tired, so this is officially my shortest blog entry. Funny though. For a lot of people, this is as long as it gets (XP).
