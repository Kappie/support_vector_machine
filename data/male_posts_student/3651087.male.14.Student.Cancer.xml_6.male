To My Ring(Nick)  I called u ring is because rings are always round and it is forever strong and mighty just like u always gung-ho and never say die.Our bad times is just like the ring has some spots but if you take a cloth and wipe it the spots will be gone just l;ike our friendship.And I will always be the one who is always the inner circle of the ring giving u support and adives no matter u like it or not or if u need it or not.  To My SPectacles(Sam)  I called u my spec as you are the person who always lets me see the good and bad side of things although you are a girl but I treat u like how nI treat Nick and I hope that u will always be the one can support me for issues at all times  To the both of you ,I want u to know that these 2 items ,I use them everyday and at all times it is just like my relationship with u all always there when I need u all and I hope that the both of you will not cling onto the past-BGR but you will care for your studies ,family,friends and most of all you besty pal----Marcus the laughter Boy.  May god bless u 2 in what ever u do and bless that god will dwell in you and u will dwell in him forevermore.   Amen
