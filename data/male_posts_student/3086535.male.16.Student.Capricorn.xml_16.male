He nods and looks over Kalid, then closes his eyes and tries to picture her naked again, giggling as he sees her in his mind. "You shan't get off easy just because of your body, lassy." he grins and lifts his rum bottle level by the neck, rum splashing all over his hands out of the open bottle. A dark brown aura begins to hover around the bottle, Schnee Gott lost in the lines of a drinking song, grinning and belching out note after note. Finally, a gigantic laser beam shoots out of the bottle, barreling directly at Kalid. Schnee Gott giggles like a school girl and thinks that should Kalid get hit by the laser beam, she will feel the affects of drinking ten fold!  Kalid snickers, the sight of the drunken human amusing her. "You think you can win in that state?" A slight grin tugs at her lips as she looks him up and down. As he speaks his slurred words fill her ears and she snarls, "You weren't supposed to see that!" Her nose curls up at the smell of the rum as it reaches her and she places her palms together, pallid fingers wrapping themselves around each other. She looks over to Schnee_Gott and suddenly sees a beam heading towards her head, quickly she tries to move out of the way, but, not fast enough it hits her. All around her the world goes fuzzy, unable to see very well Kalid moves her hands apart and a tiny emerald orb sits in the middles of them, it begins to rotate, faster and faster, growing as it does so. Clumsily she points towards the human and the ball flies towards his chestâ€¦  Schnee_Gott cackles crazily, saying, "You should be more careful!" and a spur of crazy laughs follows as his beam hits, infecting Kalid like a whole gallon of rum. He watches her staggering form, giggling at his own magic. The drunk stands tall, his race able to hold their alcohol well. He beams at Kalid, walking a few straight lines for her viewing pleasure. Upon seeing the green emerald orb shoot at him, he raises his bottle like a bat. Another drunks' song about the strength of men echo's forth from his lips, his terrible voice carrying on the wind. His rum bottle materializes over, the glass growing extremely thick. He takes up a sideways stance and swings, smacking the orb like a professional baseball player. He winks and says to Kalid, "One of my favorite drunken pass times!" as he watches the orb shoot over Kalid's head. Unluckly for her, when the ball made contact with his rum bottle, it was effected by Schnee's own special kind of magic. It explodes in the air above her, raining down upon her thousands of tiny multicolored eggs. One egg cracks open and out climbs a tax collecter, instantly growing full size as he steps from the egg. He walks to Kalid and shakes his head, an angry look on his face. "You haven't payed your taxes!" he bellows. If Kalid doesn't think quick, she'll find herself filling out paperwork until the end of time.  Kalid screams, the sight of the tax collector scaring her immensely! Quickly she draws her sword and slices at him, metal blade flying through the air and glinting in the moonlight. Her blade hits true and the tax collectors head rolls quickly across the floor. Slightly clamer now she looks over at Scnhee, sapphire orbs blazing, "I shall not be beaten by a drunk!" The effects of the human's last attack still with her she stumbles, and her eyes glaze over, a drunken grin tugs at her lips and she staggers over to schnee and hurls her blade, unskillfully at his neck....  Schnee_Gott unfurls his pair of icen wings, defying all laws of physics, the wings stretch out, spreading to a wingspan of nearly forty feet. He jumps once, his wings pounding downward in an attempt to push him into the air. He soars up, out of reach of Kalid or her sword, before looking down. He eeps! and stares at his foot, the sword stuck into his boot. "I caught it with my foot!" he tries to bend over and pull it out, but his form flips over in the air and he falls to the ground, smacking it with a thud. His wings quickly melt off, no longer of use at the moment. He stands up, not bothering to pull the sword from his boot. "My big toe!" he bellows at Kalid, a funny looking grin spreading over his lips. The words ring out, echoing throughout the sky. The purple grass shimmers for only a second, then you realize it isn't shimmering, it's exploding! The grass explodes, blowing up all the leftover eggs from earlier. Out of each egg jumps a big toe, but these be not ordinary big toes! Each one has a face and tiny limbs, a grin on their little toe faces. They rush at Kalid, ready to throw themselves at Kalid to avenge Schnee Gott's injuried toe. Kalid better be scared, big toes can leave welts!  Kalid blinks, the toes running at her, having never faced this sort of attack she doesn't know what to do! Looking down at her own feet she sees she's wearing her boots! She can stamp on them! So, one by one she stamps on the big toes, crushing each one in turn. She tramples on the toes 'til there is only one left. She bends down and picks it up, blonde hair falling over her pale face as she does so. Picking the toe up with slender fingers she holds it tight in her hand. Muttering something indistinguishable under her breath she sets it down on the ground, and it hobbles over to Schnee, roaring madly and foaming at the mouth at him it rips at him with tiny hands, and kicks him with tiny feet...  Schnee_Gott gasps! and wants to hug Kalid, only she is far away. He sends her a flying smooch before leaning down to pick up the big toe. "You were thinking about me!" he grins and rips the little arms and legs off the big toe before leaning down and pulling his boot off. He yanks the sword out with it and cuts his injuried big toe off without a second thought. He shakes his hand, pours some rum on the wound, and sticks the new big toe in place. Grinning, he says, "Now I can attack people with my rabbid toe."
