He hasn't blogged since Friday, two hours before we kicked the living shit out of everything in Baghdad.  He might be dead.  I hope not, I really find his blog interesting.  Anyway I am really,really,really tired and exhausted.  Last night I was up until 1:30 in the morning.  Not late for most of you but I am the person that goes to bed at nine on weekends.  I would rather not go to school tomorrow but you know I will be there.  At least I won't have any school on Thursday or Friday!  Hah, people think people that are involved with the play are stupid.  Who is stupid? Gregg no longer thinks that I am a seventy year old man in a fifteen year old's body.  He thinks that I am a seventy year old woman in a fifteen year old's body. Maybe I am.  Who knows?  I am not making much sense here, so I am going to go take a nap.    "Be careful going to sleep, you might not wake up."
