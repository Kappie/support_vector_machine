A guide is a dead entity - usually human but not always - who achieved a level of talent in a special field while alive.  After death the entity chooses to assist the living.  Unfortunately not all guides are what they seem.  Many are spirits who are only here to have fun, these ones will try to convince you do act in strange ways - often sending individuals insane.  GUIDES AND THE LIGHT  Thankfully we have at our disposal a force which we may use to test the validity of any spiritual entity we encounter.  This force is sometimes known as the White Light.  The White Light has been known by many names in many cultures - the Christians refer to it as the Holy Spirit.  Essentially it is the fundamental building block of existence - the White Light allows for no lies or deception.  To use the White Light first of all you must visualize it.  In your minds eye visualize a beam of pure light descending from the heavens.  Next visualize the light collecting into a ball infront of you.  Finally throw the light toward the entity you are wishing to test.  An entity you can trust will be happy to have this happen to them.  Any entity who is hurt, or becomes angry, should never be trusted.  This technique works well against living psychics as well.
