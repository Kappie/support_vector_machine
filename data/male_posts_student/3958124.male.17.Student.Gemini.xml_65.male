No. In a post on her own site, J.K. Rowling  urlLink says  (last paragraph) it herself:  "I shall tell you one thing without making you shift any bricks at all: the HBP is neither Harry nor Voldemort. And that's all I'm saying on THAT subject until the book's published." HBP is the Half Blood Prince, by the way. Just to clear this up further, let's use method for solving systems in algebra to clear this theory up completly. If Harry Potter was the Half Blood Prince, substituting Harry Potter for the Half Blood Prince in the title might make sense. "Harry Potter and the Harry Potter" would be quite redundant. I'm sorry Trav, but this is one of those times that  you  are wrong.  Lol. Less posting about HP and the HBP, later.
