Mum placed her hand over my forehead and says that I might be running a fever, so I popped my thermometer into my mouth. True enough, the thermometer reads 38.1˚C. This is a normal fever right? If not, I should be resting after taking panadol. Well, as u can see, I’m not resting. Should have seen this fever coming, because I was already feeling cold after a match. Could it be that I perspired too much bringing my body temperature down too much? But before that was radiating off heat. I wonder~   On the lighter side, today’s badminton session was an amusing one. We played a paired match, Desmond with LiLing and me with Linus. LiLing returned our smack by hitting the shuttlecock when it bounced off the floor. Since we’re not playing a proper match already, Linus and I came up with a combo to counted attack LiLing’s special moves. HEHheee…. Our combo was pretty much something like what you would normally do in a volleyball game, either one of us had to set the shuttlecock so that it was the flying straight up and the other would be smacking the shuttlecock down into opponents’ ground. They even did their own style of combos. I learn how to play smart instead of playing with strength today. For the first few match today, I was running all around and hitting long shots, that undoubtfully end up ‘outside’. With stamina dropping quick, I turn to light returns to save my strength. Ended up, everyone was so very close to the net. Then there was this game between me and Desmond, I got the shuttlecock touching the net and falling over to his side of the court, cool huh? Before long we were chase out of the court because our booking time is up.  We went for lunch, well at least they did at block 3’s coffee shop, which was the closest to our secondary school. I only got myself a drink because I told mum that I’ll be going back home for lunch. Saw my god sister, Mujiao, having her lunch at the coffee shop too. She’s currently working as a librarian in our secondary school, heard that the pays not bad for a job that she’s so use to doing. The guys finished eating and it was time to part, we said our good byes and head for home.   After a nice shower and lunch, I went for a nap. And so here we are again, my brain feels like a marble spinning around in my head. Not long after I woke up, Tara’s SMC (save my computer) message came in.. HEHeheee…. I passed on the problem to Kenneth and he passed it on to his friends. We had thought of all possible solutions, but they all dun seem to work. What to do? It’s almost 6pm now, I think I better rest. Sorry.
