She has to cancel but I end up heading down anyhoo. So I'm wandering around looking for something productive to do and out of no where my friend Julia appears. We get to talking and she introduces me to her friend Sara I think her name was. We end up spending the better part of the afternoon together which was a blast. I head home and am not in the door more than 10 minutes when I get an invite from the one and only Vanya to come hang out with her and Christine. So I head 'er over. The night started off normally. The usual snide remarks from the duo about me being a closet gay and then them grabbing each others ass and randomly spooning each other. We head to Vanya's and hang out there. On the way I saw my dear friend Janine (I have way to many friends who are girls. Time for an infusion of testosterone and sex...With women) Anyhoo it was the stereotypical night of a regular group of kids. Which is the exact opposite of my usual night (ie sit at home and say hello to miss Palmela Handerson). On the way home we listened to Deathcab which is one of my all time favorite albums. There is something extremely surreal when you sing the lyrics "She is beautiful but she doesn't mean a thing to me" right next to the girl whom until the very recent past I was coocoo over. Whatever. Probably never gonna see either of them ever again. Which is quite depressing actually to think that that might be my last memory of either of them. I've said it before but I'll say it again if you're reading this either of you. Have a goddam good life. You deserve nothing short of that.  *Heavy sigh* Goddam tired.  Found out my uncle whom I haven't seen in over 3 years (Dad's brother see Superfreak for an extremely abbreviated version of that story) is dying which is strangely depressing. The man was an asshole to me even when I was still seeing my father so why should I care? Fuck death is so depressing.  Whatever nothing much else to report. G'night  Oh I started a nexus account. I'm jumbojimbo for anyone who wants to add me. It's still shit I'm gonna spend all day tomorrow editing it.
