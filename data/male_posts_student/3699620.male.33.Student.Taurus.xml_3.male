Sometimes I think we are not rational enough, all the time we pretend to be so, though. One simple evidence is that weather influences the way we feel. Do we need to be always rational? I used to say yes to this question. Now I doubt if I would return the same answer. I don't think that being rational doesn't always make us more like a human being.   I hope this blog could be a good place for me. I intend to keep this place rather private. Of course, 'private' doesn't mean to get you guys out of here.
