Bishop saying that he was gunna ask kim 2 the prom (my advise: I think his chances are good, thats having spoken 2 her after school, but just a hint)  3. Ben and Bish apparently stealing somethin outta my bag, evidently something small, unnoticable, and seemingly non existant, oh well i should have expected as much but the words ben's, head, stuck, up, Bish's and ass spring violently 2 mind   4. Emma giving me a phone  Well im dun   GO Flames, GO Flyers!!!!!
