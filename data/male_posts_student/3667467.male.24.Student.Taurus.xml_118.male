Not the "Late Show with David Letterman" David Letterman, who is good, but the "Late Night with David Letterman" David Letterman, who was also good! Remember the memories? Dave trying to quell a fight between Andy Kauffman and a professional wrestler? The time Dave jumped from a trampoline onto a wall of Velcro? The time he hired a mariachi band to play in a neighbor lady's cubicle for her birthday? Today's episode was especially cool, because R.E.M. was the musical guest. Not the 1990s R.E.M. that everybody knows, but the indie newbies R.E.M. from 1983! They played twice, and one of the songs didn't even have a name because it was so new! AND they got an interview! (Michael Stipe hid behind Mike Mills during the entire thing). That's good TV! And to top it off, the featured guest was Julia Childs, who made ham and cheese sandwiches with Budweiser Beer! ROCK!  "And the best part is, it sounds even better singing IN, than when I'm singing OUT! YOU! Always naysaying!" --Jack Black, "Tenacious D"
