I got a new rug, new furniture, new cool posters and now it looks like a 40 year old's room instead of a freakin 10 YEAR OLD!!! That is all... about my room... NOW TO THE DAILY NEWS!  Ok so this is what I did...  - Track Party... "pizzer and soder" - Mrs. Feltman - Accidently pissed off Kaiser - Went to Shapiro's with Matt and Paul - Matt went to mall so Matt, Paul and I went to Brady to play basketball - I brought Matt to Paul's house to get picked up and he got really scared when he realized his backpack was still in Shapiro's locked house. (Big Trouble Matthew) - Went back to park, Paul and I went to get ices, we got our picture taken, said happy birthday to King Icee, went to Walgreens for a card for Paul's mom, then bought The Ring for Paul's mom (It's her buffday) - Went home, got some sleep, played drums, went on compy, sent the TDA 1st original "Behind My Back" song to all of you hard core TDA fans... that means everyone...
