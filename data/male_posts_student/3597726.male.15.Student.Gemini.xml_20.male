The site is going to have all the stuff about my story idea. Its only a temperary site though. Thomas  said  he'd make one for me...atleast get me started...I think.  I'm soooo bored right now. I think I'll be copycat and write down some random comments.  -1- I hate it when novels or films have something that doesn't help out the plot or story or anything...its just there...  -2- One word. Through2u. Actually, its kind'a like three...no, its one...kind'a...  -3-  I like writing (.) like this.......................................................  -4- I read horror novels, then turn around and read Jane Austin books...  -5- I'm probably going to change my email soon because lycos totally did some late spring cleaning on their site and i hate it. so it'll probably be something like... strong_bad@blablabla.com  -6- I'm bored  -7- I plan on getting married when I'm older. That is, if any girl will have me...  -8- I wish I was older...  -9- One of my dreams is to be a published author. However, being Spiderman would totally rock. But there is ONE goal in my life that I will not write down. Because if I told you, I'd have to kill you...  -10- I've proved a theory...Matt knows how to coun't to ten and put(-) before and after numbers. Pretty cool, huh?  -11- I don't want to go to bed, but my time is almost up...  Ok. That post is long enough. My mom needs to get on, and I need to get to work on my novel thingy. Ya know, my story idea could use a name. How about something like...Crimson Secret...nah, too majestic...what about...Kimnar...or something?...wait. I got it. Crimson Secret! Its brilliant. ok, its decided. Crimson Secret. cya...
