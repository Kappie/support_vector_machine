Today was a great day school-wise, for the most part.  Some stupid stuff happened but he doesn't actually remember what it was.  And some good stuff happened which is what he remembers more.  Regarding one bad moment he remembers, Purdy was not at school today which was unfortunate for she is a positive addition to the core.  However, Dotti and Haras were at school today so Tyke still had some lovely lady lovers to keep company.  Tyke, against Haras' wishes decided that he was going to go to the girls basketball game.  But Dotti, Purdy, Macaroon, and Amed were all supposed to go so that was a good reason for him and he doesn't really even get to talk to Haras much at bball games, unfortunately *sad face :(.  In 4th period Tyke texted Purdy but she didn't re-text.  So he actually listened a little to the presentations again.  And whats worse is that he is going to actually have to present on Monday, maybe Tuesday.  So that will mean he has to figure out some bullshit he can say for 5 minutes or so.  The rest of the day kinda dwindled to a pulp but 5th period saw Tyke start up Operation "I'm gonna flirt with you hot freshman girl that is in Purdy and Dotti's Link group and yet you won't even acknowledge that I am flirting."  Yeah, he had no luck with day one of the operation.  Now, he is not looking to be a "cradle robber" as one of Tyke's friends so eloquently put, but rather just finds it incredibly rewarding to "flirt" with girls that are much younger than him.  Kinda perverse in a way, but whatever, as is Tyke.  Tyke also walked by Skippy's 5th period class 4 times during class and then 2ice after class.  That was fun.  After school Tyke went home and shortly thereafter Amed, Kinker, Fejj, Tyronius, and Macaroon all made appearances, in that order.  They played some MOH and just pretty much only did that.  After they all left Tyke talked to Purdy online and they planned their night.  Purdy came over and picked up Tyke to go out on their "date."  Haha, it's funny to think that really the closest Tyke has to experience with a real date with a girl is going out to dinner with a girl who has a boyfriend with her driving.  But hey, there's nothing wrong with that.  It was just a nice din din between pals.  They were gonna go to Chili's but seeing as it was 6:30 on a Friday night and they couldn't find a close spot to park they went to Schlotzky's which was a great choice by Tyke.  All the while they had been listening to the styles of Tyke Turner's 1/23 CD aka Wide Array Ish.  Odd choice for a title and he has actually forgotten what he meant by that title so when he makes his version for Dotti-which will be on Saturday-he can make a better title.  Anyway, Purdy seemed to be pleased by the songs on there and that was a good omen for Tyke's future luck with giving his CDs out.  At dinner, they just talked about stuff and things and chewed the fat.  All the while picking out not only the same chips to eat but also the same drink!!!  WOW!!!  And Purdy said that if she were going to get a pizza she would have picked the same one that Tyke picked!!!  And Tyke wasn't even hungry!!!  HOW REMARKABLE!!!!  Almost as if they were meant to eat that dinner at Schlotzky's to show them that they had similar tastes.  Almost, but not quite.  After dinner they went to the girls game and watched that and talked to some old friends (sorta) and tried to find the Wicked Witch of the West.  Purdy thought that she saw her on the Sly Lion side but it was a different cheerleader as Tyke pointed out.  Anyway, the girls won and cheering was fun even though Purdy seemed to be really not feeling well and Dotti was sitting on the other side of Tyke so he couldn't talk to her.  But all was well at the end and the "date" closed out and then Tyke's second "date" of the night began.  Dotti drove Tyke over to Macaroon's work's sister's place where they met up with Karla, Mandy, Dudely, and the rest of a crew.  Good times right there.  They got in their cars and got ready to go.  They picked up Shy McPrettyCoolGuy at BCC and then went over to Jet City Improv for the nightcap.  It was a great show and Tyke totally got what he expected.  It was an awesome time and Tyke totally could see himself doing something similar to that in his future, were it not for his career as a newscaster.  Still though, he could probably have the talent enough to do it.  Quick thinking is key.  But anyway, after that Dotti tried to find the freeway but the rest of the car was no help to her really.  So she summoned her power of mapping and managed to get them back to the freeway and onto I-90 home.  They stopped at Shell and got some Sprees and Funyons...oh, and gas too.  Then they dropped off Shy McPrettyCoolGuy at his house/apartment/whatever that was and headed off to their cars.  Dotti then took Tyke home.  Tyke of course capped off the "date" with a kiss goodnight (lie) and wished his fair maiden a safe trip home (lie).  His "date" may have started with one beauty and ended with another but it was still his best "date" ever.  So thanks.  And goodnight.  Damn it feels good to be a Tyke-sta.
