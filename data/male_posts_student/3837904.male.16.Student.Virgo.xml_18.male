Today I teared in school for the first time. Everyone was in shock[not really everyone, cause some didn't care.] to watch me in despair. Had a real talk with Mrs Tai and she explained to me whatever that I've to do and I feel that well, if he don't wanna talk or he don't care about me even if I cried, it must just be that his not ready for anything. I'll forgive him and i'll just leave him alone I suppose till he feels the right time to turn his face towards me. But I still do care for him and I DON'T hate him. Hope for this moment to pass us fast and I can stretch a smile without putting a mask.
