No one should ever forget how he and other innocent republican prisoners suffered through the horrors of the H-blocks. Beaten and tortured for purely political reasons - and then called a common criminal by the British government. What a joke.  I post here his entry (translated from Gaelic) of Tuesday, March 17th, 1981 - 17 days into his hunger strike and 49 days before his death:  "St Patrick's Day today and, as usual, nothing noticeable. I was at Mass, my hair cut shorter and much better also. I didn't know the priest who said Mass.   The orderlies were giving out food to all who were returning from Mass. They tried to give me a plate of food. It was put in front of my face but I continued on my way as though nobody was there.   I got a couple of papers today, and as a kind of change the Irish News was there. I'm getting any news from the boys anyway.   I saw one of the doctors this morning, an ill-mannered sort. It tries me. My weight was 57.70 kgs. I had no complaints.   An official was in with me and gave me some lip. He said, 'I see you're reading a short book. It's a good thing it isn't a long one for you won't finish it.'   That's the sort of people they are. Curse them! I don't care. It's been a long day.   I was thinking today about the hunger-strike. People say a lot about the body, but don't trust it. I consider that there is a kind of fight indeed. Firstly the body doesn't accept the lack of food, and it suffers from the temptation of food, and from other aspects which gnaw at it perpetually.   The body fights back sure enough, but at the end of the day everything returns to the primary consideration, that is, the mind. The mind is the most important.   But then where does this proper mentality stem from? Perhaps from one's desire for freedom. It isn't certain that that's where it comes from.   If they aren't able to destroy the desire for freedom, they won't break you. They won't break me because the desire for freedom, and the freedom of the Irish people, is in my heart. The day will dawn when all the people of Ireland will have the desire for freedom to show.   It is then we'll see the rising of the moon."
