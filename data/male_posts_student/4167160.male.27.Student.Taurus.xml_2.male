The ingredients in the pot is called "Oden-dane", which literally means seeds of Oden. Each person has favorite Oden-dane, which could be a good topic to talk. It's got another name, which is "Kanto-daki". People living in Kansai or eastern part of Japan use that name.  In this picture, I put daikon radish, fried tofu, white potatoes and konnyaku in the soup. I think I served it at a student party. There were a couple of vegetarian and vegan among us so that there was no meat or eggs in the pot. Also, I could not find some ingredients for Oden or other ones are expensive.  It is very subtle differene in Konbu kelp and katsuo(bonito) stock, which is used for miso soup, but konbu kelp is necessary for Oden.  Tofu is widely known now, so do eda-mame, I guess. As a next healthy food from Japan, I would like people to try Konnyaku. It is potato starch product. It looks like jello. It could be substitute of meats in stir fries.
