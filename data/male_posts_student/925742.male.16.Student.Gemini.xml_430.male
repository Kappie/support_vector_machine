Thats the second material thing I would want.  Annnyway.  No school tomorrow, either, apparently.  This just makes my 'a or b day' sense go outta whack and I can't tell what from where.  I shoveled snow today and ate a lot of chili.  Now my bowels are paying the price as my body is adding 20% to my house's total methane saturation in the air.  I'm farting a lot.  HAHAHAHAH HE SAID FART!  Eh.  That was lame.  Derek and I  whooped  eachothers asses today, doing kung fu (I say kung fu and gung fu a lot, either or, really).  I hurt my foot by roundkicking his knee, my left forearm by blocking his kicks, and my knee by taking a kick to it.  My knuckles still hurt like a bitch, after doing bloody knuckles with the guy.  And that was... 3 days ago.  Yikes.  So he fashioned me some Thai Arm/Wrist wraps from gauss.  Haha, little known fact, the Thai boxers would used to make forearm wraps, stick them in glue, and attach broken glass to them, verrry painful/deadly when hit.    Anyway, I clocked him a good time RIGHT in the left eye.  A classic, vertical kung fu punch, right there.  He said he saw it coming, quick, but could do nothing.  Then he said his color and vision got distorted for a few moments.  Haha, owned.  Its not a black eye, thanks to the hand wraps, but it needed ice something bad.    Thank God for    otherwise I would still be in pain.  I'm getting better, and kung fu is probably my vent for my violent tendencies and current (somewhat) sadness...... that, and video games, loud metal, and eating half of what I used to.  Maybe I'll shed a little weight, that would be nice.  Nobody likes a fatty. *hahahaha, ow...... the truth hurts*  Anyways, this was overall a good day.  Oh, did ya know, they're allowing fireworks in Singapore again, thats cool.  If I ever go there, it'll be Chinese New Year, and I'll pick fights with random people.  Weed out the ones who don't know kung fu.  Or get killed by some student of Moy Yat.  Hahaha, I'm so stupid.
