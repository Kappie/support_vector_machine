I was on my way to Hellboy and saw a girl I know from Law and Legal a few yards from my house, then I was at omni four, and Jason from Law and Legal was there, and then I saw Alex Conyers' loud ass geo metro drive by with a head-bobbing Alex Beckman in the passenger seat.  They drove to Subway, we got out, talked, and then there was this girl from my Chemistry class!  Insane.  And then at work today, I went to Menards and saw John Seymour.  And I got paid for 21 hours.  Wooot.  I got some more black tranfer paper, so I''m gonna work on another Megadeth shirt.  I'm driving the Lincoln LS down to KCI airport with my dad to pick up my mom tonight.  Painkiller?  After I make the transfer.  Mood - Too tired to be philisophical  But not too tired to headbang  Music - Megadeth - Use the Man
