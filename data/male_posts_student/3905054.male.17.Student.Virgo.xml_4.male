Joke of the day~    10 Things In Golf That Sound Dirty    1. Look at the size of his putter.  2. Oh, dang, my shaft's all bent.  3. You really wacked the hell out of that sucker.  4. After 18 holes I can barely walk.  5. My hands are so sweaty I can't get a good grip.  6. Lift your head and spread your legs.  7. You have a nice stroke, but your follow through leaves a lot to be desired.  8. Just turn your back and drop it.  9. Hold up. I've got to wash my balls.  10. Damn, I missed the hole again.
