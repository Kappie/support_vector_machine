I know this is abit hard to realise, knowing they are a bunch of traditional folks and it's hard to change them considering how old they are now. sigh. sometimes i wish they would be more responsive and speak from the heart, rather than their mind. this is the thing about asian culture. you do not speak from the heart. do u know what i call my family? Ice-block family. Everything is based on yr actions and interaction. quite sucky eh. I wish that there are more warmth in the family. this is what it lacks....warmth, love and affection. It's just 3 forms of emotions but my family is lacking it. They won't even talk about love in front of yr face and the parents just discussed it among themselves.They can't seem to talk directly but rather indirectly. Sheesh. what's wrong with them. I feel the distance growing apart. Kinda sad when i think about it and there isn't much i can do. I tried to improve it but somehow the respond is not very encouraging. crappy
