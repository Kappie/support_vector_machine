My aunt's wedding was beautiful and the reception was a blast. I had a party there and I got mostly jewelry. My aunt and new uncle got me a 14 karat ring with ruby and diamonds in it. My other uncle and aunt gave me a really pretty bracelet. And my grandparents got me a gold necklace. I'm mostly excited about my brand new COMPUTER!!! It has a flat screen which I really like! I'm really excited about it.
