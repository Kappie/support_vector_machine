I also have a blog of my own that I created 10 minutes ago, which I will share with you when I figure out how to. I've been invited by virtue of the fact that I too am a library employee, if only for another two weeks, after which I will become an unemployed law student. Still in that time I will cram in as much joyful library experiences as I am allowed by my fellow bloggers.
