I am now faced with the depressing reality that I have a buttload of money and I'm going to have to spend most of it on dorm room stuff. Oh, well. The other night I went bowling with Toni and Huevos. After I found the picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi in my purse (don't ask why, just accept) we decided to use the Force and bowl with our eyes closed. Toni and I were much better at it than Huevos, but that was probably just because he decided to use the dark side. Toni and I put on padawan braids and we changed our names on the score screen to slightly SW-ish things. I love being a big huge dork.  I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....
