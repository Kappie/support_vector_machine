I basically have to write more about how people were waiting to see how  Blockade  does before passing judgement, a wrap up, and a conclusion. I think in the end the paper will be about 17 pages.  Nothing else is really new with me... I was only really annoyed this morning when I found out that the professor wasn't going to show up for my 9AM class. I basically woke up early for nothing! That really blew chunks.  I'm going to get myself some munchies and then finish my paper.  ***
