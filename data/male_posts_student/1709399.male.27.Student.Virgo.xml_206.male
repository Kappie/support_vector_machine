Also my cousin had come to Delhi from Sydney for a few days and I met her almost after 4 years. It was funny when she recollected that within those 4 years I had lived in 6 different cities  changed 3 companies !!                              Also managed to Update my Photo Gallery on webshots (I will post the Link) . Uploaded some photos. Next time I visit Chennai will have to upload the others.
