The tree had clung to life on the roof of a temple and I was only half the height of one of its ancient roots. .  urlLink     A little more about my trip to Cambodia. I disliked the country immensly. It pulsed with an undertone of raw hunger and mute violence, seen in all of its people - from the swaggering, truncheon twirling security guards at the small Siam Reap airfield, to the hawk-eyed taxi drivers insisting on taking you around the city for the whole day for 100 US dollars, to the open distrust in the eyes of young children, to the people's hatred for the Thais, evident in the name Siam Reap, which means Defeat of the Thais.  Angkor Wat was a testament of all things grand and majestic that human beings are capable of. I cannot begin to describe the marvellous beauty of its many temples and palaces and ruins, of which I took countless photos. But the reason why this tree was my favourite was because it seemed to me to capture the spirit of the country most perfectly: its stark, wild necessity for footing and survival despite the inhospitable, barren artifice of black stone from which it sprang.  I know its not fair to judge a country and its people just like that, but in my opinion, if you really want to see a landscape of truly transcendental Buddhist architecture, go to Pagan in Myanmar, where the people behave convincingly so. And hey, they too know all about bloodshed and repression.
