I denied to them, "Not always but sometimes", and they argued back "No leh, always online or everytime see you put away or busy.". Ok, that's what I was well-known for regularly putting away in the past and I had been named as "Away King".  Another absurd line from one of my classmates said "You very hardworking leh, always see you online you put "Busy". Yeah, I was busy playing games. I replied back. Ok, I know you guys are human, obviously is human. Then what, animal or ghost? I understand human tend to make assumption and impression in their mind. To them, their impression of me is the one who goes online most of his time and then putting away or busy in MSN when actually sometimes he is at the computer.  Let me tell you guys, I am a human too and you should understand human sometimes tend to be lazy. If you don't get what I mean, I better get straight to the point. I am just simply too lazy to even move my hand a few centimetres to set off the away or busy. Are you convinced now? I think you guys should try to study more on me and perhaps even do a research on me so as to know and understand me better as what I have done to you guys.  You guys didn't know that "ni shen zai fu zhong bu zi fu" (Living in comfort, without knowing how fortunate you are). Haha, my English translation from a Mandarin proverb isn't that bad right? Anyway, that's not the main point. I want you guys to know you are so lucky and thankful to have me as your classmate who secretly study on you all the while.  So you guys know what to do? :P I don't request for much, each of you just take turn to give me a big treat for lunch everyday in school, be it McDonalds, KFC, Delifrance or Long John Silver. There's 36 of you guys excluding me right, so each of you will only need to treat me at least once a month and I can have my free lunch all year round. Isn't that smart? *Wink* ;-)  To avoid and prevent this case from happening again, I swore I will never put any status on my MSN except "Offline" so you guys will have nothing to complain.
