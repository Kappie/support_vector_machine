Like on Sundays, I have to deliver like 50 papers, and each one has more fucking adverts than the TV!   Plus there's all the CD's they keep chucking in there. You can't get the fucking papers through the fucking doors! Then there's people with extra small letterboxes, they just piss me off, I usually fold the papers in half (as if closing a book) and if there's bloody CDs hidden in there, it just ain't possible!   So eventually I just take the paper apart (take the pages out) until it all fits through the letter box (which can take a fooking long time, I tell thee!)   I'll probably be back tomorrow when I've got more to complain about. Grrrr...
