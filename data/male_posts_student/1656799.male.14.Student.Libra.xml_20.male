I've neglected many things, namely doing work at school and updating this blog, which I need to do more often. I want to get out of this pattern as soon as possible, I finish school on Friday and I don't want to be facing six weeks of achieving nothing and being lazy in general.  I'm thinking of getting my forum up again, although it wouldn't really work due to lack of members, as it always does. Not only that, but I'd prefer to do something that keeps me out of the house as well. This wouldn't really effect my amount of blogging considering that could be done at night or through the medium of (dun dun duuuun) e-mail.  I would love to go take more photographs over the holidays but even photography has faded away from my to-do list in the past two months. Its not that I don't like photography anymore -- its just that Swindon is a dull and boring town, and there are very few sites which would look good.  I don't really want to see many people during the holiday -- only four or five people I'd rather see. I suppose they know who they are, mainly because I tell them everything on my mind which frequently doesn't make it onto this blog.  So yeah, motivation, I need it, and preferably in abundance. I'm fed up of lazing around the house and doing nothing. Suggestions left in the comments section or an e-mail sent to poor_posture@[REMOVE THIS PART]hotmail.com would be appreciated.  Hell, if you want me to do something stupid or funny then go ahead and suggest it, I wouldn't mind doing it. In fact, I'll do it unless it has something to do with me and a large amount of pain.  Toodles.
