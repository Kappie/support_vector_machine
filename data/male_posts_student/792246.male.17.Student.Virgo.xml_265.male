People were telling me I was cute today, which I suppose isn't that unusual, and its not like I believed them, because I never do. And it certainly isn't that  I'm  starting to have a more positive self-image, because I had a minor internal meltdown today when my sister made fun of my pudgy stomach. But today gave me good vibes. So I decided to go downtown. I made myself all pretty(which apparently means putting on a pair of jeans and playing with my hair for five minutes), and drove to the Stoner Plaza, hoping to see Lauren, who was rumored to be home.  I was wrong. On top of that, I forgot that today is "Everything Makes Eric Incredibly Depressed Today!" So as I walk from Pizza My Heart to Borders back and forth about two times, and I'm about done with the second lap when I realize how much I suck. But because I've been watching Angel, I can't just go and mope at home, I have to brood. So I'm planning to go back to my car and brood in private, but when I get to my car some bloke sees me parking and is ready to take my spot, so I have to move. So I don't really want to go home but I have nowhere to go, so I ended up driving and parking at the top of that new parking garage by Emerson. Here I get out and stand over the edge and watch the world below, which was really kind of boring because the building on the other side of the street really blocked my view. An interesting twist however was when I noticed two people getting it on a few cars over. Afraid they saw my weird brooding, I get in my car and leave when they get out of the car and I realize I know them. To protect their identities, I will call them Bortia and Beric. So I had a hilarious convo with Bortia and then left and went  back  to my first parking spot at the Aquarius.  Again I started randomly (meaning back and forth) walking the streets, eventually deciding to spend some time in Borders instead. So I start looking around, when I see William de Japanese class smooching some blond.  My  William. If I had been sane at the time I wouldn't have reacted at all, probably because I hadn't even thought about him in months. But since it is "Everything Makes Eric Incredibly Depressed Today!", this made me, as you may have already guessed, incredibly depressed.  So I go up to the college books and begin looking at colleges to transfer to, which caused me to find a great number of things to be, as you may have guessed, incredibly depressed. I was however pleasently surprised to see that the "Great Breast of Knowledge", a hack which my father participated in, was briefly mentioned in the MIT writeup of one book. I shortly after realized I was sick in the mind however, when I became depressed upon reading a negative opinion about Palo Alto in the Stanford writeup. I promptly left. Oh, and there was the crazy old man. I really hate crazy people. A lot.  So I leave, and storm back to my car in a, not so stormy way, and to add one more random thing that means nothing but still depresses Eric to the picture, I pass "Padam Pernstein" having way too much fun with some people I didn't even recognize. He's still hot.  My life sucks. I'll never have a social life, let alone a boyfriend. I've given up trying and I'm going to die an old gross bachelor when I'm 26.  How are you all doing?
