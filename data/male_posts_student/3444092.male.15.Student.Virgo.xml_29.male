So, mall tommorow, correctemundo? I'll propably go.   Sometimes I think me and my dad might be the same age. Today, in the car, he said to me "hey, you wanna go to an APC show this summer?" I was shocked. So when I got home, I went on the internet, and ordered the tickets.(87 fuckin dollars!!) So on June 6 Im gonna be in San Jose jammin to the tunes of Billy, Jeordie, James, Josh, and Maynard. Sometimes my parents can be so sick.  Been playing KOTOR lately, and if you're not a nerd you dont know what that means. So, I wont talk about it anymore. More to come later.     (BTW, thats Jeordie White aka Twiggy Ramirez of Marilyn Manson, he is now the Bassist for APC, sweet shit)
