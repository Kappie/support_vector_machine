First, a difficult life: I have recently been learning many... different things, just for fun and to use up some of my spare time; mainly Esperanto, Hexadecimal arithmatic, and writing with my left hand. All are very challenging to get the hang of, especially writing with my left hand. (I'm right handed). It really exhausts you, and seems to take all your energy, trying just to write about 10 lines. Learning to write for the first time must be hell. It aches your hand so much! Ok, now for Esperanto. If you don't know, this is a language, made for the pupose of being international, and very easy to learn. Despite this, there is still one heck of a vocabulary to learn, as well as figuring out word order and what-not. And this is meant to be an easy language. Something like English must be terrible to learn. Although I don't remember it being that hard... Children have to learn a whole difficult language fluently in just a few years! And now for Hexadecimal arithmatic. This is, a different number system to the decimal one we are used to. Instead of 10 digits (0-9) there are 16 digits (0-F). Although I've just got the hang of counting up and down, addition and multiplication will be very challenging. Learning how to do this at school must be terrible. I now feel some pity for those young fools who still can't do simple addition. Even though they are at school, kids still have so much to learn; which they MUST learn, or face being labeled a retarded cretin. I'm mighty glad all I'm doing is voluntary.  Ok, now for the easy life. 'Ignorance is bliss.' [as said by Cypher - The Matrix, 1999]. Being 16, I live in a world where I have the knowledge that instructions to make nuclear weapons are posted on the internet, asteroids could hit the planet at any second, wiping out all that we know, and that life can only get worse.   Which brings me onto my second point of the day, aresponse to  urlLink megatrobe.blogspot.com 's last post about hope, and that everyone needs hope to be happy. I shall try to make an argument against it, but most likely fail miserably. (You can feel the cynicism already, yes?) Throughout history mankind has been living in a world of false hope, living on dreams, which rarely come true. Although people can be happy with their false hopes, they really should just face the real and miserable truth: things can only get worse. Take the 1950s for example. Our parents and grandparents were told of a life of luxury in they year 2000, where robots would do all our work, and space holidays on the moon would be common place. And what have we now got? Unemployment through automated jobs, an overweight nation through lack of manual labour, and exploding space shuttles [my condolences to families of those on Columbia shuttle]. And what are we now promised? People walking on Mars, 'smart' houses with sensors and voice activated what-not, and cars that will drive themselves where you want to go. This will no doubt lead to more unemployment, more laziness, and more unforeseen disasters. 'Things can only get better'??? Bah, humbug!  In other news, I watched 'Never Been Kissed' last night, a truly terrible film about a reporter going undercover in a high school in America, despite having bad experiences there as a child. (Think Richard Hann crossed with Paul Leonard torments) If you don't know these people, which is more than likely, then just the lowest of low people in the school, who even the geeks and nerds reject. :) And this un-amusing story is mixed in with some love story with one of her teachers. Not a particually good film.  That shall be all for today. Bye for now.   Weather:  Overcast mainly  Reading:  The Fellowship of the Ring (They've just got out of Moria)  Listening to:  Good Stuff  Watching:  Never Been Kissed  Confused about:  MSN not working  Annoyed with:  Computers  Mood:  Fine
