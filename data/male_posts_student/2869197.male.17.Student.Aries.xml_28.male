I think its time I explain a little about the way my mind works. Most things that affect me I regard with passive agknowledgement. Basically, I admit that you are there and leave it at that. No matter what you do, I simply agknowledge you did it and go on, quietly forgiving and forgetting.   Example:   I need to get from point A to point B: http://photos.bravenet.com/892/191/471/16699E1DA1.png  But there is a problem, an obstacle standing in my way. For our purposes let's call this problem "unruly mob of freekin' freshmen" or UMoFF: http://photos.bravenet.com/892/191/471/4CE5EF875B.png   Now the standard junior would give an UMoFF the "evil superior being glare" they've been developing throughout their sophomore year. Or perhaps this junior would break out his gas-powered weed wacker and just mow them down. I accomplish my objective simply by knowing the UMoFF is there and where it is not there. Maybe there are holes in the UMoFF and I shall walk through the storm without hitting the droplets. Mayhaps I shall find a point C to walk to and around the UMoFF. Confrontation is unnecessary. Through this philosophy I escape many situations that would only result in anger on both sides. I follow the way of Sun Tzu and win the war without fighting a battle. But don't get me wrong; I'm not a pure nonconfrontationalist. I will confront the problem for 2 reasons: betterment of others and betterment of self. If there are other people behind me also trying to get to point B, I will politely (or not politely) request the UMoFF to move. If I believe confrontation will test my mettle and turn me into a better man (debating, playing the devil's advocate to learn more, etc.) I will do so within a heart beat.   Now assume my plan has failed and I found myself in a negative position. The UMoFF was displeased and I have reached my goal but in a flawed means. Will I be angry or agitated? No! I have believed that your reaction to any situation is a choice. I will be sad, because I have partly failed my duty, but I will also be happy because I have tried not to fail.  If I were to only live this way, I would have a deadly gray and boring life. Nothing would miff me, but nothing will bring me enjoyment. I have decided that throughout it all (it being life), I will look at all the things within it and be glad. How many blind people are in this world that cannot see the good and the bad? The simple fact that I can see is a gift. I enjoy small things: the neon green of a Jesus Freak T-shirt or an aphid, the muddy dark green of my car, the motley of pink, white, and red of my skin. And that is only sight. That is the key.
