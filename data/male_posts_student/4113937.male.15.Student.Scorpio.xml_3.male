However, all of us was quite disappointed but no choice, in our heart we did our best is enough already.       the celebration was quite fun, first time ever sing in front of the whole school, that is the first time i'm so daring to be in front of the school.  Didn't join them for the line dancing as there is some class chairman thing.  after that didn't went out with my class, went out to orchard with the NP friend.      went to watch 'The Village', the movie was quite nice although it had a boring opening.  I got frighten by the red creature.  The movie is about a village of people, that change the enviroment of their living, they went to a hill next to the wood. From there, the elder of the village make up story that there is something in the woods, and the villager is suppose not to enter the woods.... overall the show is quite nice and meaningful? haha.. alright, i'm not writing a reveiw about it. Haha.. after that went to pacific plaza and it happened that there is a quarrel between our friend Wei Qiang with the shop keeper. haha.. overall.. i don't reallly know what happen.        My granny came back home today, and she look quite okay, but really very weak.  And i was like so useless and cannot help out much.  So i should find time to be with her.  It been a long time that both grandson and grandma didn't talk.  It will be the right time now.        Shall end here! See ya!
