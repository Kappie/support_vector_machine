It wasn’t a nasty look, but rather a jolly “what the hell are you doing?” look.   My grammar has gradually gotten worse.  Anyway… I’m quite annoyed that I still don’t have my laptop. It’s been like 2 months!   Pizza... mmm... Pizza... I wanna try kicking the dough up a notch as Emeril would say. I'll call Minh-An later and pick up some cheese for my next pizza.  ***
