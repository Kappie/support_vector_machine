Nothing against the other guys in my room, because it wasn't them that caused it, at least, most of the time. I feel crushed after something that happened, and I'm just not liking how that goes.  And everything that has happened since has kept me in that bad mood.  Nonetheless, I have come back with new pictures, and, no, I didn't get to Audioblog at all, but, oh well.  I was too busy.  So, here are a couple stories from this year's camp:    2004 Class: Desktop 5  This was the best class that I had taken in my three years of going to yearbook camp.  The teacher was the head of computer support at the Walsworth Publishing Company, and he was pretty cool.  He smoked though, which was bad, but, we got over it.  I learned A LOT of new Photoshop stuff, and I'm going to be teaching it here in a few weeks, promptly after school starts in August.  Everything is on Mrs. Yearbook Advisor's laptop, so I don't have access to it until I get back to school.  The people in the class were awesome...I kinda liked one of them, but was too tied up liking someone else on my yearbook staff to even worry about anything.  But, the class went extremely well, and I think me and Melissa were the only ones who ended up NOT complaining about a class at all, since everyone else was bored to death.  One girl even had to stay up until 6:00 in the morning doing her homework (which she shouldn't have done, but she made the decision to).  So, my class was awesome.  Nothing wrong with it.    Camp Story: The Irish Dude and the Security Guard  Alright, the whole room situation was kind of annoying this year.  The guy next door to our room complained about everything, which practically forced me into a complaining mode.  The first night, he yelled at Mrs. Yearbook Advisor for checking up on us, and that was the beginning of it.  And, last night at 11:30, a security guard comes up to our room and says that "they are getting 'extreme complaints' about our room, and that if they got one more, they were going to 'evacuate us from the room.'"  We weren't really being all that loud when he came through.  In fact, it really wasn't us.  The girls that kept coming in the room were really loud.  And the door was broken, so no matter what, it always slammed shut.  Adam even yelled at him, telling him to try closing the door without making noise.  The Irish guy was constantly made fun of by us.  We should have annoyed him as we left this morning.  Because that just pissed me off last night.    I'll be back in half an hour with the first of the pictures.  They include Alex and Courtney wrestling, Alex and Melissa H. wrestling, and more things that interested me the whole trip.  See ya.
