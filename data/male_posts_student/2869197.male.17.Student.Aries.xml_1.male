Calvin is a college based around my personal belief system, Calvinism, and I truly felt at home there. I stayed in 2 Beor, which I find out later to be the Jock hall. Blast! Why does my life keep getting more confusing and complex?! I was all happy with my logical prejudice against all Jocks, then I met these guys and it just goes up in flames. The college student I roomed with was going into PreSeminary, which allowed me to ask a few questions. His friends were curtious and witty, and also talked to me about colleges. They had a Bible study that night, so I got to tag along. It actually answered one of my Great Theological Questions of Life (tm). I learned that the command of Jesus to "turn the other cheek", "walk the extra mile" and such should be followed until it damages the communion and fellowship which is another vital command of God: "I was glad when they said unto me 'Let us go into the house of the Lord'". The previously mentioned examples did not interfere or harm the commands, and therefore are good. The next day, Friday, I got to go to an actual class: History of Philosophy. I wanted to go to a Religion class, as that  will  be my major, but this was the next best thing. Surprisingly, it wasn't mercilessly confusing, but only a light brain-numbing sensation. I'm definitely considered a Philosophy Major or Minor. At the luncheon, I sat next to a Philosophy Prof. and another Friday student interested in Philosophy. Imagine my surprise when she tells us she wants to go into Missions! She seemed to have her heart set on a college called Moody Bible Institute, but was looking at Calvin for kicks and giggles. I'm intrigued by this Moody. I suppose I must add it to the growing (and shrinking) list of colleges I have to check out.
