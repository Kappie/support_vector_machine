I was drawn out off the people who have had all A's every 6-week period. (Or 3 A's 2 B's, but in my case it was all A's  )  That's pretty much all I have to say right now. Didn't do much yesterday. I was mostly bored. We did was the car though so now everythings nice and clean. I also got a new MSN Messenger skin off of  urlLink Mess.be , but that's pretty much it.   PS- I've entered it on  urlLink  Where's George   ( urlLink Click here to see the page ) and I've also updated  urlLink My Profile . See ya around =-)
