After much searching and following links I have found 15 blogs from Southside and thus make up the nominees. They are myself, Hannah Ray, Joseph Ray, Rebekah Ray, Mary Ray, Allen Blackwood, Charity Blackwood, Katie Bussell, Abby Elder, Eleni Elder, Patrick Blue, Christy Helweg, Ryan Cerbus, Ashley Rusk, and Mia Straw. The way I will rate is on a 10-point scale. Frequency = 40%, Content = 50%, Neatness/Design/template = 10%. The content is based on length of posts, writing quality, and what is said (a good balance between fun and maybe some more quality stuff - bible verses, politics, poems, stories, quiet times, debatable stuff, etc.). That is the setup. The list will come soon.
