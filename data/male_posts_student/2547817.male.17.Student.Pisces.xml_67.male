Might be staying over at FMSS tonight. We'll see.  Slept till 1pm today. A very nice tune popped into my head at about 9am but I put it off and said I'd remember it when I woke up. I feel like shit coz I cant remember it. Screw laziness... All I can remember was that it was only worth 2 lines and it had something to do with a "she" and talking to or turning to our friends.  On another note, I'm still in love with hazel. It's been 4 months since we broke up and I still dream of her. Last night she was with me, We were in school and she was close. I felt warm and happy and strange. I turned around and kissed her on her head. I knew it wasn't real, yet I wanted it to be, so much so that I believed it. You don't understand?  She would.
