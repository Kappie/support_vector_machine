He takes things from ska and punk culture, and a few inside jokes, and slams them together in one poorly drawn menagerie of curse words and Mustard Plug references. Anyway, I'd thought I would post one.  (Edit: I took it down because it was messing up the sidebar.)  In case you haven't heard, I am the greatest MS Paint artist to ever walk the planet. Unfortunately, one night someone accidentely deleted my four years of random Paint riffing. I think I will get into that again, due to Chris's unintentionally hilarious comics inspiring me.  If you want to check out some more, you can find Spelunker Comix urlLink  here.  Be warned: the other kid's comics are not funny at all. They are as boring and pointless as the kid who drew them. This kid is named Michael. Now I have only have met this kid once, but he annoys me so much that I have trouble describing it. First of all, he is an extremely spoiled rich kid who plays video games all day long. He thinks that he is the greatest Halo player to ever walk the earth. One day, I was over at the Oselands when he came over. He started talking trash about Halo. Me and Chris didn't really care, and just blew him off. Finally, after a hour and a half of his taunting, we agreed to play. Needless to say, we killed him. The only time he would get a kill would be stealing one from one of us. He started throwing a fit. It was quite funny. Finally he said, "When Halo 2 comes out, I will kick your ass, because there will be no pistols." I don't usually use this word, but then I called him the biggest nerd I've ever met, for obsessing his victories over me in a video game that won't come out for months. After my admonitions for being such a jerk, he left the room in a huff with Chris and Erik agreed with me that this kid was a grade A scumbag.  Our medallion hunt didn't go so well today. Tomorrow, there will be a significant clue, but people will have had three hours to look it over by the time we get it. Still, hopes are high. That thousand dollars will float our pirate radio station, of which we are still determining the name. The radio station is looking better every day. I have ideas to take requests, have guest DJ iPodders, advertise surreptiously in BHS, and perhaps have liberal/conservative point/counterpoint. Wouldn't that be fun?  Well, I'm going to doodle. I'll see ya tomorrow.
