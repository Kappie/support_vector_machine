Anyhoo.... yeah this summer has sucked my ass so far. Working at the co-op gas bar is the lamest job ever. Bad pay, bad shifts, lame managers the usual. In sticking with the emo mystique I guess I should be obliged to spill my feelings in some form of lame poem or something so how about this....  Raindrops keep falling on my head Yeah I already screwed this Haiku up (is that how ya spell it??)  I guess I can express how I feel using the immortal words of one 50 (fitty) cent. And I quote "In this white man's worl I'm similar to the squirrel. Looking for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut."  I told the girl of my dreams how I felt about her a few months ago but got shut down like...a guy getting shut down. I'm just gonna say to her...You say no one wants to be with you but I did and you said no. Think about that next time you mention all that jazz... I just realized how egotistical sounds. Can't think of a better way to word it. sorry.  My parents....I'll save for another time. That subject deserves a post all to itself.  Anyhoo I'm off to pump some vehicular orifice. Adios
