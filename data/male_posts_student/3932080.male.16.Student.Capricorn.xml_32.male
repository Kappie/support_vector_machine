Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Move Ya Body -Nina Sky (feat. Jabba) Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #6 Upon meeting the Puerto Rican twins that make up Nina Sky, hip-hop producer  Cipha Sounds  pushed them straight into recording a club jam over that incessant  Coolie Skank riddim  (the same beat featured in  Pitbull’s  “Culo” and  Elephant Man’s  “Jook Gal”). They came up with “Move Ya Body,” a paper-thin dancehall hodgepodge shifting between Jamaican ruckus (from party host Jabba), some vacant verses, and a simultaneously catchy and eerie chorus. That eeriness, perhaps, arises from the fact that Natalie and Nicole sound like  I, Robot  extras; they hit their pitches perfectly and create monotone harmonies throughout their dronish cue. Unfortunately, keeping that tone in mind, it's hard for one to take boogie commands from a duo that sounds like the only dance they can do is the robot.   The Verdict:  4.6/10 - Brouhaha   (2.3/5)
