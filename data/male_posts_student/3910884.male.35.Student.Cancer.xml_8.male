They just go 'where ever.' Possible human waste contamination due to bare-foot traffic through those same areas.  2) No centralized area for garbage. Again garbage is strewn 'where ever.'  3) Village states that well water is causing diarhea. Possible contamination of well due to watershed location (the well is located on a hill however the watershed may lie underneath a contaminated stream bed).  Suggested water be tested by Department of Health.  4) Noticed that chemical contamination in stream leading from village to lahar.  5) Villagers also complained of asthma and other respiratory problems. The village is very near Clark Airbase and probably has a history of pollutants being dropped on them. Garbage is also burned in the community creating toxic smoke. Smoking also prevalent with adults smoking around young children.  6) Educational services have declined in the sitio. Committment by the Department of Education has waned and support of the Calapi Elementary School is mininal (the teachers are there 3 times a week for 4 hours at a time and the parents are complaining the children aren't learning). Grade level maximum is grade 4.
