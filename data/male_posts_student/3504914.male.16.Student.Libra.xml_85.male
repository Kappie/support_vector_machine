The horror!), however...I must ask...what the hell were you doing at the forum in the first place? Why would you go to a site called www.gamefags.com?? In a way, I find it even more frightening that you actually took the time to read through them and then copy and paste them on here. I guess that's what happens when you have too much free time. By the way, how long are you going to be sick for anyway? Zio misses his bitch. :) "  With great power, comes great responsibility. I made it my job long ago to try and help the world and rid it of stupidity. By correcting grammar and spelling in MSN conversations, by sarcastically commenting on everything that breathed and even things that didn't.  With this new knowledge, you should become wary on how stupid people can become from using net lingo. If you had never seen this, would you have believed such idiocy exists?  And besides, I didn't take that long to find the more stupid comments on the site xD I would just click one link, then another, and the first post i'd see would be a sufficient example. Try it yourself, you'll find that the effort I took wasn't very high.  And I should be back tomorrow, despite my doctor saying I should get a three day rest.
