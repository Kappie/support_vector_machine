I thought that it was pretty cool. But not as cool as her gift to me on my birthday a few months ago. She got me an awesome book.   Well it sounds like her gift to you was cool...and your gift to her just plain SUCKS!   I also baked her something to take along with her to Boston. She is going to Boston on Thursday, so I will only get to see her for tonight (which she has gay band...which I like...but she is in too many things. But I wont control her life too much....:S). I also get to see her tomorrow...but not at school. She is job shadowing. Tomorrow night will be the last night. She will be gone for about 2 weeks...I think. But Im not quite sure. I miss her so much...and she hasn't even left yet!
