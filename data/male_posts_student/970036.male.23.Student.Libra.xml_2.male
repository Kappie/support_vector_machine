I never did finish this SNES classic back in 1992, and I'll be damned if I let another 11 years go by! 11 years of pixelated-related mental torture and that incessant low-health "blinging" ringing in my ears. B-bling, b-bling, b-bling, b-bling...ahhhhhhhhhhh, my kingdom for just  one more  heart!  It is nice to be reminded, however, that this older game is more challenging than  Ocarina of Time  and  The Wind Waker  combined.  *sigh* I might as well run across the street to 7-Eleven and pick up a cube of Pepsi, 'cause Gannon ain't gonna defeat himself.
