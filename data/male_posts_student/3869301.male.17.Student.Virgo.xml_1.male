I finished reading Watership Down. It is only the second book I have ever read that I think I will tell everyone to read. It is filled with adventure, suspence, and vivid imagery. Truely a great work.  I got a letter in the mail from myself. All of you from AGS probably did too. I had forgoten all about that day in Area III sitting next to Halley, that math chick that was in both my Area II and II classes as a way for the powers that be to toy with me, when I wrote this letter. I will probably produce the letter with commentary tonight if I get around to it. I think it is rushed but informative about my psychie then and now.
