I think of all the reasons why I absolutely have to go to school (ie: tests, projects due, nuclear fusion, etc) and I came to the conclusion that if I did rush like crazy to get to school after missing 1st period, all I would do all day is sign yearbooks. Now I don't want to sound mean or anything, but I hate signing yearbooks. I did the whole Have a great summer! bs in middle school and sometimes I would just write my name which would get everyone all upset, heh. So now I've resorted to turning my brain off and writing furiously. Whatever happens happens and there's nothin you can do about it, you just slam the book shut and pass it. So I've only signed a few yearbooks and the highlights were stuff like, "No I will not father your children no matter how many times you ask," or "Have a lovely summer but make sure not to buy too many lawn mowers." I didn't get a yearbook cause even though my parents would be paying the insane $100 for one I'd feel like a jerk wasting their money like that. My dad said that I should have gotten one cause when I'm like a million years old I would want to look back at my yearbook, but it would probably just make me depressed and remind me of how old I am and how I'm gonna die soon. I know a guy who spent like $400 on a class ring. I'd rather just cut my finger off to remind me of highschool cause at least then I could put the $400 dollars to good use. Man highschool makes me mad. I'm glad I don't have to think about it for the next 3 months.
