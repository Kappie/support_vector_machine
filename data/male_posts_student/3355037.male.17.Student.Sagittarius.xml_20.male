Now I feel good for accomplishing something that doesn't really matter.   I have noticed recently that certain songs/things (but mostly songs) remind me of certain people. Example: Cum on Feel the Noise by Quiet Riot reminds me of, who else, TYRONE. Try Honesty by Billy Talent reminds me of Kohler. Poker anything reminds me of... well you know that one. Hmmm... to continue the list for no apparent reason or go find something productive to do... the list it is! The Offspring remind me of Boyd. The Used remind me of Dalton and Nate (can't really think of any catchy names for them so, eh, whatever). Ben Folds reminds me of, well, my good girlfriends? That doesn't sound right... let's go with friends of the female genre. Hahaha... I'm a geek and I know it! Remember kids, the first step to rehab is to admit you have a problem. Hi, I'm Pbre and I have a problem. Hahaha.... ok I'm going to leave now before I start creeping anybody out.   Hey look. Grammar.
