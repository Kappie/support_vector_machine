I said that a person like you was not in my heart. I said that I forgot you so easily And I said that now its nothing  You were exhausted by my lacking love and you left. I made you cry so much that I didnt have the courage to hold onto you Im sorry my love...  Please dont ever meet a person like me. If you do, then dont ever give him a chance. You are so nice and mild that you have a hard time saying 'no' You loved me who lacked so much... thats enough right there. Disappearing so you wont be unhappy anymore, is how I express my love for you  I was so transparent... so you were sometimes nervous You probably felt like you couldnt handle me Im sorry my love...  Please dont ever meet a person like me. If you do, then dont ever give him a chance. You are so nice and mild that you have a hard time saying 'no' I thank you for loving me It was a love that a person like me couldnt receive again Dont cry, think hard... The words saying you only have me... you need to forget them all.  You loved me who lacked so much... thats enough right there. Disappearing so you wont be unhappy anymore, is how I express my love for you
