DAMN THOSE FARMERZ!!!...hhhanywayz yeah, this mornin i was all grouchy and shit cuz school is lame and i hate it to the max...well today actually went by kinda smoothy...im sorry that mrs. beyer'z mother in law died, i sent her my condolences, but yeah, today was awesome in her class cuz the final was a piece of cake. Yeah...vball practice was kinda tuff i guess, cuz of the new wash drill casey is usin, like its a game to 25 but how much the other team scorez is how many linez u owe and for the other team (non starterz) is how much they got beat by is how many linez they owe. So the 1st game we won 25-7, so we had to run 7 linez and they had to run 18, then i next game we won 25-19 so we had to run 19 linez which is omegaly gay, cuz i feel that running in vball is pointless, unless it is sprintz on the track or something, not freakin milez and shit...yeah, so we're gonna play channel islandz tomorrow ova thurrr, im disgraced cuz i though aznz were suppose to b tight at vball, but they suck though, so its time to teach those aznz how its really done ya hurrrrrrrrrd. well g2g, i might post stuff later...later dayzzzz
