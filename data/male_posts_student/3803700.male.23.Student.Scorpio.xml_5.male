Arab Muslims on horseback and Camelback have been committing mass murder and even genocide against black Muslims and Christians who occupy parts of northern Sudan, and their scorched earth policy is the biggest criminal act in the new 21st century.  The lighter skin Muslims rape women who gather water outside of the refugee camps in an effort to breed out the black, meanwhile their husbands are brutally killed. I watched as 1 million Rwandans were killed in a low-tech genocide that was not addressed by our politicians.  These horseback murderers in Sudan are no match for even a small US or UN intervention force, and any force that could be used would literally save hundreds of thousands of lives. So why wait, do not let Rwanda happen again, I do not want to ask the obvious question again: When will we learn?
