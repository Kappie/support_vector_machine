I met Gloria and HuiLing at 8.30+ and we went to meet SL, CQ, ChaoJian, ChinKang, Hann, PeiYing, WQ and Joyce. Meow meow!! We took the MRT to CCK station. Oh yes, I read Today's newspaper in the train.  We took some bus there. We alighted at some stop, and while approaching the school, we were like very scared. We see that we are the only ones that arrived this early (9.45am). Then, we saw the reception. We just stood around there looking like dummies. Then, someone called us over, and offered us goodie bags. Nobody dared to take, and they push me towards the tables lor. so, I took the goodie bag and everyone followed suit. Meow meow!! We then walked and walked....we went into a tutorial classroom...quite cool. It was a GP classroom. I spotted some worksheets and stole them to let everyone see. They were very shocked at the difficulty of it. HaHa!   We went up to the hall (The Althing). There were various CCA booths there. There, we met many Riversidians. HaHa! Woah! Riverside in full-force ar! Then, a council member took us around to tour PJC. His name was Sheng Qiang. We toured the hall, then the canteen booths. Many booths were quite fun, actually. I don't agree with the rugby booth. So violent, the game! And the players actually enjoy being violent. Oh my. Most of the booths were nice. Yep! After touring, SQ persuaded us to take part in thw quiz. We can win a moutain bike if our ticket was chosen. And hahaha. The photographer keep shooting us. PeiYing tried to avoid him, but was "caught" in the end. HaHa!! I will look out for our photos in the website, I think.   After filling in our forms, we went to the art society to go into the "Huanted Room". Ticket entrance was 50 cents. Ayiah...never mind la. After that, we walked around to wait for the queue. Then, we came back again. Me, Amanda, PY, Clar and Ping joined went in first. Woah! The room was not so scary. HaHa!! Seriously. We kept laughing and laughing. The entire room was dark. There were people lining up along the sides, touching us, giving the "creepy" feeling. So meowful! Then, I saw a female posting like a sadako thingy. Quite realistic wor! Long long hair in a white robe, sitting behind incense and stuff, with red crepe paper hanging down from the ceiling. Quite real leh! HaHa! After that, we came out. Amanda said it was so funny. Then, we waited for the rest to finish their tour and go for their turn (they didn't spot us...sigh!! lousy la! We were at the study area....they looked in our direction, but didn't see us. HaHA!). After everyone completed the huanted house thingy, they were laughing away. Hann even wanted to go back again to throw coins at the people. We are so bad! HAHA!   After that, we waited for about an hour to see the lucky draw. Meow meow!! At the lucky draw, woah!! Everybody was waiting to see the prize. The consolation prize was a football signed by the principal. Give me also dun wnat....no interest in football whatsoever! HaHA! Then, the number was mountain bike was drawn. It was 087. Ay-err! Mine was 256. BUT BUT!! WQ won the bike! Oh my god! I can't believe he's so lucky! HaHa!! How meowful! Woah!! And SQ was so happy about it. After all, he persuaded us to join! :) WQ had to call his Dad to bring him and his bike home. HaHa! Then, we went to Lot 1 to have lunch (I ate mian fen guo). Then, I went to Wendy's house with intention to study Bio.  HaHa! I found that I have no mood to study after all. I was too excited about PJC after all. Woah! HaHa! Tomorrow study lor. I bathed Lassie today! Wee! So fun! HaHa! I got wet...and it's so ticklish when Lassie shaked her body and sprayed droplets all over me. HaHa! We then blow dry her and combed her hair. Such a cute Lassie dog! And oh, Wendy said it's up to me and my father to pay money for the chalet. Sh'll be giving me the $300+ plus tomorrow! Woah! Such a big responsibility. HaHa! Wendy's mother hinted that the beach near the chalet is huanted. Hmmm....how interesting. AFter bathing Lassie, me and Wendy played the PS. Then she went out to eat lunch and I went home.  Yep! I think that's all for today. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
