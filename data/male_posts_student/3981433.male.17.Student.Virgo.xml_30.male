We went and saw The Bourne Supremacy at the cinema - Max Beverton, Tim Daveys and Dan Grovsnor was there - i made them all feel special and gave them all a big wave...perosnally i think there were suprised i was with a girl on not on my jack...  anyway - we try to eat ourway throught his huge box of pick 'n' mix and there was so much we gave up.  the film was great - however the way the camera moves in some of the fight/running scenes can bit a bit jiggily which helps in confusion, but not in being able to see the actual fights/running/ driving sequences.  after the film we went for a short walk along the high street and checked out some shops...we saw some really stupid figureines in Prelude. who the hell would buy them?!  walkin her back to the trainstation she fancies a burger - so we stopped off at Burger King - because i told her that they didnt have mustard, gerkins or relish....she hates them...but as always i was rong and they did! so she endded up goin me the burger...half eaten.  so i drop her off at the station and come home with dad to watch some TV thing on fraudsters...amazing stuff - some guy made £50m  in copying £20 notes...what a dude...but he got caught so he sucks fat ass.
