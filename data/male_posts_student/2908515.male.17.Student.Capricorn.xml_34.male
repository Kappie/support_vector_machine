Visiting people and doing this and that before he leaves.  And I totally understand that.  I had expected this, although I wished it never came true.  I'm having mixed feelings.  I feel  angry  at him for not sending me an e-mail when he got back.  I feel  angry  at him for not calling me when he was over there.  Or anything at all.  There was no contact and I am  afraid  that it will be like this when he really does go over to Japan for good.  Yet, I feel  happy  that I did recieve an e-mail from him.  But at the same time, it feels like I'm being squeezed into a time slot.  An appointment for him.  I want to act  selfish  and request special attention but that would just be bratty.  He said that maybe he could squeeze me in for a movie or something.  But not for the whole day.  I guess I'll settle.  Thats all I can do.  A movie?  Which movie?  We can never agree on any kind of movie.  I had wanted to spend the whole day with him so I can spend some time with him on my bed.  Because we always wanted to do that.  It'll be romantic and fun.  But I guess not.  If we were to do anything, it'll be in the car again.  I want to do something.  But then again, I don't.  It is the last time we are going to see each other again in our teenage years.  What is appropiate?   I don't think I want Charlotte to come with us.  But I want her to meet Matt.  I think that once she does, she'll know more about me.  Since no one really knows that much about me, I want her to be one of the first to get to know the real me.  And to meet Matt.  But then again, its our last meeting.  Is it wise to invite another person?  I don't think so.  But I'm torn nonetheless.  Whatever.
