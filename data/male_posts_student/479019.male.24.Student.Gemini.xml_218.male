Good stuff. $1.23 for a 6 pack of Heineken is a damn good deal... thanks to a coupon I had. Derek and Kaho also had some chardonay thanks to another coupon. From there it was Del Taco and watching Smackdown. Good stuff. Kaho was a bit messed up from 2 Heinekens and 1/2 a bottle of wine.  Yay... work tomorrow. At least Tom, Pat, and Rudy won't be around. That means an easy day tomorrow. Heh... I might even get there a bit early to squeeze in some time.  In rotation today is  Anti-Flag 's  Mobilize . That's a damn good album. "9-11 for Peace" is such a bad ass song.  ***
