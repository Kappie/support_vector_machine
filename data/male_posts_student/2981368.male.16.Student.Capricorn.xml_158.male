And I haven't even started on the Science yet. Oops.  Also there have been various recent discoveries in the field of BDF, including:  + Whilst Kaiba Seto is not a sweetie, Jounouchi Katsuya  is.  So there.  + Alice went through a looking glass. Upon trying this same experiment, our eminent scientists discovered that she was, in fact, on crack.  + Set made a better god of evil than Anubis. *blows raspberry*  That is all.    - BDF - the best damned jester in the blog.
