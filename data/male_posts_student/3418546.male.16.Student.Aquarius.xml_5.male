I've been hanging out with some cool people (lauren, tim, sammy, kelly, rich, dan)... I've never really been around them a lot before so I have yet to see if they really like me.  Yesterday I was at Garrett's house cause his girlfriend got in a car crash :O! and we picked him up.  I played Halo on his x-box..it was fun.  I think I have Rich to thank for most of this cause he's a cool guy and lets me tag along at shows with him and stuff.... I just hope he doesn't get too sick of me.  I've been trying to keep myself busy and it's been working for the most part.  I still need to sort out all my schoolwork so I can stash my bookbag somewhere and be RID of it til next year..  I broke my new birthday-gift computer [twice] and I have the new parts sitting in my room ready to be installed.... I hope I don't break it again!  I really want to be able to play quake3 again and listen to some nice music... I've also been working on a  urlLink website for my mom   Anyway thanks for reading, keep me busy, call me up 9221752! PEACE
