Quite a surprise to Tyke as he expected it to be slow and really boring because it is the first week back from break.  But he was wrong.  And Thursday didn't suck as much as expected either.  It started off marvelous cuz Tyke got to drive the Avalon.  Man, that lady is fiiiine.  She gets up and goes before you even notice it.  And it is amazing how smooth she is.  You don't even know when she is accelerating and shifting.  Oh, and the sound system is sick.  But Tyke thinks that almost all new cars are like that.  1st period was a little bit boring today.  Tyke thinks tomorrow should be fun though cuz the regular teacher won't be there but there is apparently like a different math teacher from the school coming in to teach so it won't quite be a substitute environment.  But better than normal.  2nd period was a lax day cuz it was power cleans day.  And 3rd period wasn't too bad.  Tyke had to lead discussion about an article but he actually read the one that he discussed so that made it ok.  4th period involved talking about weird stuff and doing round robin poems with Dr. Phile and Amed.  Except the poems weren't that good.  But they were funny.  Lunch was good.  Mainly cuz of the vehicle.  It was so great.  They went to JIB and Tyke got a really good Creamy Caramel Shake.  Mmmm...creamy caramel.  The rest of the day was pretty good.  5th period was its usual gay self.  But 6th period was fun.  Tyke and Purdy sorta did the lab well.  It got done at least.  And Tyke doesn't have to copy the physics problems tomorrow cuz they aren't due until Monday so he gets a nice little reprieve.  Tyke hasn't done anything after school this week so he continued that tradition but he did play more ESPN and burned Purdy a copy of his latest mix.  And he didn't do any homework of course.  He did unzip his backpack but he realized he wasn't going to do any work so he just zipped it back up.  That was the extent of his homework completion.  Unfortunately Tyke doesn't think that he is going to get to drive the Avalon to school tomorrow but there is still a slight chance.  Thats ok though.  Cuz it will be Friday.  And good things happen on Friday.  You know what Tyke's talking about.  ;).  Too bad that it isn't true.  Wait, what is Tyke talking about.  He was trying to make it sound like he was hanging out with a girl friend (girl friend not girlfriend) but then it went too far.  So it just failed.  Man, blogging is getting hard.  Partially cuz Tyke just thinks that everything he writes is boring.  Like, there isn't much variety to this.  And it takes time to write.  For a while it was the novelty of the blog that kept it going and the dedication to it.  Then it was the hurt and longing feeling that Tyke had for seemingly ever that was the topic.  Then there was that little stretch there.  Then it was a totally new life.  Then it was just interesting things happening.  And some break stuff was interesting.  But lately it just doesn't have that same flair to Tyke.  He could be wrong.  It only matters what his constituency thinks.  That's you.
