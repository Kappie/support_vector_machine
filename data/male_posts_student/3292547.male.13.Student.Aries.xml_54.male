However, after going back trhough all my post I had made at Neowin.net, I ran across this explaination. The answer as we all thought was in fact not the fish. In fact, the fish wasn't an answer at all. Check it out. I'm not sure where they got it or I'd post. The Real Solution to the Einstein Quiz Are you sure you want to read the real answer? Maybe you want to think about it some more? Once you read the answer, you can't go back!  Solution to the Einstein Quiz: The Fifth Pet All the answers to the Einstein Quiz I have seen on the web go through the same mechanical process to solving the puzzle. They chart out the problem, lay out each clue graphically, and slowly build a picture of which persons, drinks and pets are in which houses. Its a logical, technical and involved process. If you do all this (here is an example), you find out that it is the German who has fish.  But is this the right way to solve the problem? No its not! Nowhere in the problem, except in the question, is the word fish found. Thus the fifth pet might just as well be elephants as fish. After a lot of work you can safely conclude that the German has the fifth pet, but you have to ASSUME that the fifth pet is fish in order to conclude the German has fish. But you have no basis for making this assumption. Note that Einstein was very careful to separate the "Facts" from the "Question" in this puzzle.  So the correct answer to the Einstein Quiz is: You have no idea if anyone keeps fish or not! Once you grasp the nature of the problem correctly, its rather simple to solve, isn't it? And it is just like Einstein to give us a puzzle like this, for he stressed examining assumptions, and once wrote: "The important thing is to not stop questioning."
