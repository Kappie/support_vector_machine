Last night, I talked to her for about 2 hours, then we fell asleep on the phone, disconnected at 6 am.  This totals roughly 8 hours. 8x60 = 480. 480 + 180 = 660 minutes. Every month with telus, I get 1000 Canadian long distance minutes. I have 340 minutes left. Unless the billing cycle starts on the first of the month. That would mean most of this math is irrelevant.  I should ask my mom. Except it's 6:30 IN THE FUCKING MORNING!  Crystal Beuker's livejournal has been scaring me. She is not a happy person these days, and that is too bad, considering that was the point of this in the first place, was for her to be happy. Maybe I should e-mail her. Maybe she doesn't want to hear from me, she never answers my comments in her livejournal...of course, I don't say too much. Sigh.  I want to move to Red Deer. I need roomate. Roomate can be plural or singular.  e-mail  me.
