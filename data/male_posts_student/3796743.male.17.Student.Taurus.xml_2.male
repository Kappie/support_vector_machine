The damn FedEx man thought it would be funny to show up at my house, ring the door bell twice! and then knock a ton!!! I was pissed. He wouldn't even just leave the package, he needed the stupid signature. I'm not amused...at all! So me, looking like crap, answers the dumb door gives the guy his damn signature...and then I go back to bed.  After waking up at a more normal time, I tryed to fix my sister's computer again! I had to put a whole new frickin hard drive in it. What a pain in my behind. This stupid computer has been acting up for like the past month. I finally fixed it, after like 5 hours of my labor...I'm not a very happy camper, but its done, fixed, better...finally! I did some other crap and finished packing my suitcase to go to San Francisco. It's full totally full, but its cool. I'm so excited to go tomorrow...Emily's dad is picking me up at like 1 o'clock-ish...we are going to have so much fun! I cannot wait. So no more blogs until next Tuesday, August 3rd...when I will fill you all in about my super fun trip to San Fran.....See ya all in a week!   Good Night Everybody!
