Quite a while ago, a friend of mine lent me his backup CD's, mainly to give me FMP.  What i found on them was pure bliss.  Sure i got FMP, and i got tons upon tons of anime MP3  goodness, but the most important discovery was an anime named Nurse Komugi-Chan Magikarte.  I didn't know anything about this anime at the time, but i watched it anyways, just out of curiosity, and have been searching for more ever since.   It's a cute story about a magical nurse who is discuised as a cosplayer teen idol to the humans.  When she's not modeling new cute outfits or comming out with new kawaii songs, shes fighting virus's made by a magical maid (for the greatest virus named Angler), Komugi's arch-nemisis, who is infact her best friend in school.  The problem with the magical maid is that she can't remember what she has done when she goes back to her normal human form, and Komugi doesn't get it either.   Ultimately it's a super kawaii animation with a tiny bit of ecchi thrown in (the ecchi just adds a few more laughs, since it is just the content of the conversations.)  Don't get me wrong either, this is not a kiddy anime, it's perfectly fit for older people.   Now on to how i found it.  I checked Animesuki for it, but it seems as if they've "dissavowed all knowlege" of it ever being there, but when i go to the wannabe fansubs homepage, it shows as them still working on it.  So, i go to the wannabe fansubs IRC channel, and guess what i find?  Komugi episodes!!  I'm so happy!  So, i downloaded them and watched them both yesterday!  So kawaii!!  I even drew a picture in Komugi's honour, i'll post a link for that once i scan it!   Lates
