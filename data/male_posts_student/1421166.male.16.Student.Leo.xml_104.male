Just hope that I'll not repeat my mistakes in life.  Today, being Sunday was spent in church. Really feel good today. Except that everyone disappeared so quickly (proabably due to exams), that the day turned out quite boring except for watching TV and good food.  Oh well, I don't know what to write again. I'm not really very inspired now. Either way, I don't want to keep talking about the same things too. And much of what I've been going through these days are rather personal. So sorry for the lack of content.  This is just kind of a follow up to the 'Point Scoring' thing. Well, firstly nobody's really actually that shallow, so point proves that even if cooking scores points, it doesn't really make much a difference. Someone even commented that cooking doesn't score points, but it's character that matter. So conclusion is that, this point scoring system is degrading human intellect.hehe.
