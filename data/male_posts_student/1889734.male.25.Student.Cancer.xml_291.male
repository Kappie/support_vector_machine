This thing isn't going to make it.  I can't imagine Bush having the guts to press it home.    What is it with this guy?  He has clarity and resolve on terror, but he won't fight when it comes to cutting worthless programs or fighting for things that might actually improve our lives.  He's starting to resemble Clinton, and I'm starting to consider not voting.    Terrorism or not, I'm starting to believe it isn't going to matter in the end.  The America we defend today isn't going to exist in 50 years anyway.    I guess I'm in a lousy mood today.
