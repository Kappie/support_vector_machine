On April 19, 1993, the US Government attacked the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, leaving scores of men, women and children dead. Timothy McVeigh, who would later show up in Waco to protest the act, planned and executed the Oklahoma City Bombing of April 19, 1997 in retaliation. He often quoted Founding Father Thomas Jefferson in defense of his actions, saying "The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of tyrants and patriots." As in 1775, on April 19, 1943 an unknown gunshot in Warsaw, Poland began a forty-two day rebellion of the city's Jews against Nazi attempts to transfer them to extermination camps.  So there you go. Tomorrow's just as bloody: Hitler's birthday AND the Columbine Massacre. Enjoy your week!
