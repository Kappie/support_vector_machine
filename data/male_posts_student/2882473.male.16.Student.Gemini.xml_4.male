Like sport, it may surprise many people that being a 15 year old male I do not own a mobile phone, mainly because I would never use one. Many people have suggested I get one, but really, what for? The only time I would even consider using one would be if I were out and wanted to phone home for something, but then I could use a pay-phone for a fraction of the price. Also, if I really, really need one, I could always use my dad's phone, which many people have pointed out is over 4 years old and ridiculously out-dated, but it seems to do the job. I can just about see how some people would need them, but then why do people insist on getting a new one every few years? If you have a phone and it works, then why replace it? It's just an unneccessary waste of money, and again probably linked to peer pressure which I have already mentioned. The most modern phones out now happen to have colour screens, games, internet access, video and picture messaging, and many other accessories, all un needed. And people then go and waste their money on it. I know it's not my money, and they can throw it away how they like, but surely it would be much better to give all this money to a charity to help dying people. I hate to see money being wasted when it could be going to good causes. Picture messaging? What is the point in having a camera on a phone, the pictures aren't even that good quality. We have cameras, we have phones, we have email, so what is the point in combining them? Video messaging is even more stupid. I would also like to complain about kids who seem to spend every minute of the day sending text messages to their friends, many of whom are standing close to them! Kids walk down streets holding expensive mobile phones, and then wonder why they are mugged, especially in cites. This as I have mentioned, is probably to feed drug and alcohol addictions, and very much linked with gun crime. Many people may think that in the future, with better technology we will be able to stop crime, but that would never happen. As better and better things are made to make gulliable people spend their money, more and more people will steal them, and as always, they will always find a way around police and law enforcement. There is no way things in the future will be better, things can only ever get worse on this planet, and the problem? YOUTHS.
