They seem to be coming fast.   Here is the recapitulation of my last few days.  Yesterday: It was an "A" day, so I had TA in the morning. It was pretty cool, they have this program called Network Assistant, and I was monitoring some of the people over in one of the keyboard labs. There is an option called "Control". It enables the user with Network Assistant to take over the computer. Well, I found someone who happened to be on AIM Express, which is not allowed on the campus, so my friend and I decided to mess with their heads. He typed in "Hello". It was pretty funny. The person who she (I'm only assuming it's a she; the name had the word "Angel" in it) was talking to said "Hi". Later, he asked why she said that. She said she didn't and that someone else did. Cameron (my friend) and I could not stop laughing. I thought it was pretty funny.  In Web-Page I walked in and forgot that I was wearing my TA badge. The teacher started to teach frames (which really sucks, if you know what frames are; if you do not go  urlLink here ). I finished it in like five minutes and she used mine as an example for the rest of the class. No big deal. So I went back to the computer lab and I put my badge away. That was pretty much the extant of that period.  It was Thursday yesterday, so I had Christian Club. I really like it, and it's a nice break from my usual friends. Not that my usual friends aren't cool, just none of them share the same faith as I. The speaker was a student. He spoke about prayer and he was good, for the first time doing it. Next week there is going to be another student speaker. If you really want to know who it is, come next Thursday to Christian Club at Livermore High. The club is in S-2. I happened to know who the speaker is and that they have a lot to say.   I am getting bored right now, so I think I shall finish this later. Tune in later for the continuing, not to mention exciting, drama of Colin's Life, as he reviews his Friday.
