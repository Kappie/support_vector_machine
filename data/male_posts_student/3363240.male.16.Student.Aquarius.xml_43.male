This week was interesting....Dan slept over 3 nights in a row, or something like that...and by the end I was annoyed. Its okay though....he and joe went away for the weekend and I'm sure that when they get back all will be forgotten. SO I was finally able to see Kaya!!!!!! REJOICE!!! BE MERRY!!!!! 4 days in a row we hung out. We did many things, we went to the beach, we watched queer as folk, we slept, and stuff! It was really nice to be with her...but today we took the day off from each other. She's leaving again soon.....but for Japan.....and for a much longer time. I'm nervous..... I got a strange feeling that when she comes back, she won't be interested anymore... I hope that doesn't happen....but, frankly, who the hell even knows what could happen?  I saw the picture of the girl she is staying with...it will be a lot of fun for her. GO READ  urlLink GIRLY  part one just concluded...and it made me sooo happy *sniff sniff* Seriously.....the awesomeness. I don't remember much else..... ~Elan P.s. COMMMMMENNNNTTTTt
