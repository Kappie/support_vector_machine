Sure I still need to take a look at a few more sources, but I pretty much know what I want to write about... so I'm getting started now. The paper is supposed to be 15-20 pages. I figure with that the non-body portions is already going to be about an additional 4-5 pages... so it could potentially exceed that.  I think that tomorrow... I'm going to work more on my paper, this webpage, and my art projects.  In rotation right now is  Skid Row 's  Slave To The Grind  (1991) and  Bad Religion 's  Process of Belief  (2002).  ***
