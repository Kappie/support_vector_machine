It made me think about a good reason to be depressed. But I can't find none. I decided I'm going to be more cheerful and happy and all that sort of things from now on. I'm good at these things, changing myself. I have this 'okey, it's difficult but I am going to do it and I will finish it' attitude. And difficult it's going to be. I've decided recently that I simply do not have a dad anymore, too. It may sounds strange, but it actually makes me feel better. My dad has a handicap. And apart from the fact that he doesn't show any affection at all and that he can't remember the fact that I'm his child. He's plain ennoying. But with my 'I'm all brigthen up attitude' I won't be bothered with this anymore. I've given up hope with the Albert thing as well. That's one thing less to worry about. I'm interested in this girl now, Marinda. I like her. She's funny. I always end up in strange situations with her. Once we met this homeless gay and he offered us food. That's strange. That's weird. But I like it. Hope she has an interest in me too. Time will tell. Today, tomorrow and the day after that I've to work. Last time I worked there were these German kids (about 15). They were friendly. They tried to have a conversation with me. But I don't speak German that well. There was this girl that liked me :) But I really have to go now, look at the time. I need to sleep because I have to work soon.
