He eventually decided on the term “conservative-leaning, liberal Friend”. (For an excellent example of Conservative Friends in the U.S. see the link for North Carolina Yearly Meeting (Conservative) on the side-bar; or, hey, just click  urlLink here !)  That’s what I’ve been labeling myself for about a year now!  Martin is clear about his sense of pride in what liberal Friends have accomplished including their efforts at being one of the first religious bodies to be as welcoming to lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered individuals as any other in this world. He even notes that a number of lgbt Quakers are self-avowed Christians (typically of a more liberal, progressive type, but not always, I might add).  I wonder if one of the reasons that there are more Christians amongst sexuality and gender minorities is partly because giving up our faith of origin was not as much a luxury as it was for many heterosexual Friends. Many of us never wanted to give up our faith of origin, but the decision was made for us a long time ago by the larger religious community. (Thankfully, however, there has been substantial change amongst a number of Christian and Jewish organizations in regards to this.) We found solace, healing, and renewal amongst liberal Friends; and with this came an appreciation for our faiths-of-origin, albeit as understood by liberal Quakers.   And yet, for me at least, I finally feel confident enough amongst liberal Friends to challenge some of the norms and misapprehensions amongst us that I fear inadvertently undermines what makes Quakerism unique  within the Judeo-Christian tradition . Perhaps, liberal Friends need to take a cue from the renewal of tradition that appears to be happening amongst our Jewish counterparts within the  urlLink Reform Movement .   What canst thou say liberal Friends? Well?
