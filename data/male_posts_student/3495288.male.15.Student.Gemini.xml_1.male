Yeah, I got in to Teater Variasi and i will be acting in the new production...oh Ssshhhh! i must not tell the detail yet haha!. I was really excited cause its the first time i am doing something with Variasi. Well after i took a shower, i went to update my bloggy with that long winded poem. Than my sis woke up and rushed to the toilet. She forced me to rush cause we are late. Well we are late, Its not my fault.  In the train, Hamzah, Variasi's chairman kept smsing me asking my sis and i to hurry up. Well we can't hijack the train. Once we reached our destination, Paya Lebar Mrt Station, Hamzah, Hannah aka Annah and Khai (Hamzah's lil bro). We waited for a van to arrive and pick us up. Once the van arrived, we laughed alot in the van cause Khai and Hamzah we like the jokers. Our destination, a scene to be taken for a new TV SERIES on Channel I... We are the dancers so what me on TV hor!, was at this place and it has already started raining. Like WHAT! dance in the rain!? I was wearing this souless shoe so my feet got  INSTANTLY WET ! AH! and yes many dancers got yet too. There, a few other new friends from Variasi have already arrived first. Yannah and Niezam (Ppl call him Saiful or Zam but i call him by his name hahah donno why.) Well I know Yannah quiet well cause we both are quiet friendly but i rarely talk to Niezam but now hahaha We are like a couple, i'll get to that point later in the entry haha.  The Director gave us an apron and two soggy breads! Most of us wore the apron and i was like disgusted, but yet hungry, with the soggy bread. The director showed us how to dance and yes its very easy. Most of us thought it was going to be really a tough one but oh well. Once we danced perfectly, took a couple of shots to make it perfect, Most of the dancers, including other ppl, went into the van. We all squeezed into the van, i had to sit on the floor with Niezam sitting on my lap. For the whole journey, i and a few others, including Niezam of course... he so cute!, we like talking and i was the one making the jokes, with Niezam sitting on my lap and me holding him as if he and i are together, i told Yannah that Niezam is my son and everyone laughed. Suddenly there was a big bump on the road causing most of us to like jump up, Niezam's head hit the ceiling of the van and his butt jumped up and landed on my crotch. Shocked... but the strangest thing is that he did not mind. Yes! we reached our destination at last and this means that my legs are free! hahah. We ended up at a bakery shop which sells lots of expensive and good qualities of pastries and cheese cakes.  We waited in the baker shop for a  VERY VERY LONG TIME . We waited for the crew, We waited for the Director. We even waited for the actors and actresss. Once they came, an hour later, the director asked us to wait at the coffee shop till one of the crew contacts Hamzah. Well yes we waited, for two whole hours, Khai got fed-up he asked us all dancers to go to the bakery shop and asked us to wait there instead at the coffe shop. The camera man stopped us than his helper said that we are in luck. We have lunch, lunch at 4pm!? i had not eaten from morning and ate a carbohydrated food at 4pm!? walau so long. It was nasi briyani and rendang beef... man! its super spicy till everyone can't take it. Khai, who finished first, asked us if anyone need him to buy water or not...  LIKE DUH! OF COURSE! . Once everyone is done.. we were called in to do the FINAL shooting. Thank god! Well the part was that we all had to move our heads from left to right a few times, MAN! causing me to have my neck strained!. After everything is over there was a little short breifing about the next shooting which is still this week but on Thursday! From 11am till 11:30pm @ SENTOSA! hahah. Well i decided to go but a little later since i have school and i am not going for band on that day :P. After school i straight go back home and change than go to Sentosa... Island Life! Love it! hahah :P and yes its free entry for us!   After the shooting, We all decided to go to City Hall and chill out at the Esplanade. Once we reached the place, we firstly went toilet hahaha than waited for my sis. Once done we went to esplanade. Some of us are still hungry so we stopped by 7-Eleven and bought a few snacks. I bought two potato chips, a peach with green tea drink and a chocolate bar. I shared the chocolate bar with Niezam, the rest didn't want it what so i share with him lor. Than the Yannah and Hannah started to couple up so hahaha i sacarsticly said,"Eh i jealous lah. OH yeah! Niezam you can be my partner yeah?".. and he agreed. From that on we hold hands put our arm around each other's waist just for fun and "promote" the new production hahaha. Once we reached Esplanade, Niezam and I decided to be super gays well many did not look at us but we got a few cheers from a few gay couples. Haha. After a long rest at the Esplanade, oh yeah Afi joined along too. We went to the MERLION. We said that the Merlion was cursed by the Black witch for accusing her being a bitch till Ms Merlion got separated, the Husband Merlion at Sentosa, Ms Merlion and Lil son Merlion here at the main island Singapore hahaha. We laughed but it ended for a while when the rain came AGAIN.  Ah! HUJAN! hahah. From there we walked towards the underground path to Fullerton Hotel. Well the whole journey, I and Niezam became like gay boys who are together haha. Niezam being the gentleman asked for my hand and he put my arm like it was like a hand bag ahahah. We walked around attracted attention. We took photo together. We got out of the Hotel and went to walk along Boat Quay (pronounced as Boat Key). We made a pit stopped at Macdonalds and bought a drink, again i shared with Niezam. We started our journey from the starting line of Boat Quay with the gay boys, me and Niezam, holding hands and Hannah and Afi holding hands. Many gave us a stare but fuck hell. Than at the end of the road this pub gerl came up to Hannah and asked if she could have the balloon that she is having than she apologised. We walked passed her, i and Niezam are still holding hands. Than the lady shouted,"EH GUYS AND GUYS CANNOT HOLD HANDS! YOU TWO GAY AH!?".. and i shouted back "WE ARE BESTFIENDS LAH! EVEN IF WE ARE GAY, WE NEVER MADE YOUR PARENTS LIFE DIFFICULT RIGHT!?" than she kept quiet.. we never saw her... Me and Niezam gave a Hi-Five to each other hahah. Than i let go of Niezam and told him that i hate this kind of people cause me being really open minded and a Homosexual Activist is not a fuss to make. Than he like agreed. He like did not care lah. I think he accepted me being an Activist but i donno if he can accept me being GAY. haha. Well from than on we did not hold hands.  In the train ride home. The gang and i were like entertainers. We made a few people laugh. We acted and made lots of jokes. Hahah i my self couldn't stand it... i laughed too but i got too tired so i decided to just watch them too with Niezam. All of the sudden Niezam fell asleep haha like so cute! with those pimples on his face... which makes him cuter really!.. than he lyied down on my shoulder. And there goes again another scene people laugh. We were like Live entertainers. hahah! I and Niezam are the gay couples, Hannah and Afi were the strike coupls, Hamzah and Khai were like two deaf ppl. Hahah... Well Afi went home first than me... OH! for your information... Niezam is Straight and has a girl friend but he is really open-minded. I have no intention to like be with him ok. Well till here than hahaha SO LONG! hahah well bye bye.
