We chhose too look at our life as being bad, and yet how can that be? Think about all we have!  Point A: The mere presence of life means that life is good.      Think about it. We could be dead. But God has given us one more day. We should be dead, but God has given us Grace. I know what you're thinking. "If I died, I'd go to heaven, how is that bad?" Well, if we died today, our privilege of sharing the gospel would be gone. That's it. No more souls won for the Lord. That would suck. Or worse yet, we could be dead and burning in hell. Eternal torment. In fact, we should be burning in hell. But God gave us His Son. Therefore if we accept him as our savior and lord of our life, we are freed from the bondage of sin and penalty of said sin.  Point B: Focus on the "bad" in your life, and your attitude will be crummy.     That's right folks, focus on what's "wrong" in your life, and that will breed self pity, anger (which breeds bitterness), etc.. So what do we do? "Caleb, my parents just died. How can I focus on the good?" Okay I admit that'd be hard. And you should mourn the death of loved ones. But it should not control your life! Secondly, view hardships as good things. Hardly anybody likes hardship. But think of it this way. Nothing can happen to you without God's permission. God loves you deeply (He sent his Son to die for you). So, if God allows something to happen to you, don't you think there's a reason? It's not because God says "Oh I think I'll give Caleb diabetes today, should be fun!" No, it's because God uses hardship to build us up, and transform us into the man/woman of God He desires us to be. I think we all want to be men and women of God, so next time there's a hardship in your life, try this. Pray. Thank God for the hardship. That's right. Thank Him. Because if God is trying to make you into what both you and He want you to be, the least you can do is thank Him.  Well, sadly I don't really have a "Point C". I wish I did, just so I could keep talking about this and encouraging you. But I don't, and what I've written above is what I believe. And it helps me in life. Remember that Satan really doesn't want you to have this mindset. He'd love for you to wallow in self pity, doubting God, doubting relationships, and doubting yourself. So, just put on the full armor of God, pray with friends or family, and trust God with your whole heart. He really does know what's best for you.
