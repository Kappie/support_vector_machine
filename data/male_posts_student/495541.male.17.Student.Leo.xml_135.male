The ref said we jumped up and protested a non-call during the game while Kyle went up for a shot and was fouled.  He said we jumped up and stuff.  I really don't want to talk about it anymore because I know I didn't.  I have no idea what the ref saw.  Other than that, the game sucked.  I played about the first 2 minutes then was taken out because I got 2 fouls.  I didn't go back in until the second half when I was only in for about a minute.  During that minute in the second half, I was wide open under the hoop so many times I couldn't count.  I don't know why they couldn't lob it up to me.  I don't even want to think about it right now.  Tomorrow, I'm hoping, will be a much better day.  I'm planning on practice, getting a hair cut and then getting my license.  From then, I plan on going to eat at Pizza Ranch with the gang.  Then going to Whits and playing Techmo Super Bowl until my eyes pop out.  Woo ya!  I can't wait.  That and Tetris!@#  Woo ya.  That's about it for now.  Good night.
