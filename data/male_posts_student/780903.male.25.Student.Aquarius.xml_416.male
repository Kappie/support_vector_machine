"They said that on patient charts, Dr. Debbi made notations like: "Smart. Do not invite," or "Confused. Must invite."   "Dr. Debbi's scheme was so flagrant that at one point, prosecutors said, he billed the government for multiple services on a resident's eye even though the resident was missing that eye."
