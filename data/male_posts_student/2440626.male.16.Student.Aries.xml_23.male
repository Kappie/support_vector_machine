I am laughing too much.  New episode of ALIAS tomorrow.  Does it get anymore exciting?  I can't wait until Summer!  Or until it starts snowing again...snowing A LOT.  I love snow. I do I do I do!  And my ears keep popping...I mean I am not even in high elevation.  Ulcers. Ear popping.  Maybe I should see a doctor.  Ciao.
