I had to wake up early in the morning to go to school for exams! *sigh* I was pretty tired after watching yesterday's American Idol, I wonder who will be out today though. Anyway, my first paper, which was A Maths, lasted for 2 whole hours! Is tt sick or wad man? I mean, I was like done even before an hour. Why? Cus out of 12 questions, I onli completed 1, which was like 5 marks. L0L! But hey, I still tried my best doing the rest. The next paper was a real quick one, juz an hour. It was my science MCQ paper, which was i would say pretty alrite. The Physics part was kindda tough, but the Chemistry was still ok. I had like 20 out of 40 questions which I was uncertain about. But, well, wad can I do? So heck wif it since it's over, like finally. Phew~! And tt was my last paper for the mid-yr! Yea! I can finally get back to my slacking mode again. Haha, but they juz have to put the stupid Chinese Oral thing tmr! Tt juz freaking piss me off as it's suppose to be an off-day, a day which I can sleep at home till the noon time! Grrr! And like we're suppose to report at 08:55pm and I'm pretty sure we will be done within an hour or so. Tt, I feel is a total waste of time man! Going to school for juz an hour? The school doesn't haf the brains to organise a stupid Chinese Oral during school days! And furthermore, it's Chinese! OMG! But u noe wad? U might haf guessed it, I dun care. Haha. Anyway, after my exams today, i went to play pool wif a couple of frens at the West Coast Recreation Centre. It was my first time and it was pretty cool. Well, at least i managed to shoot some balls in. Haha, it was real fun, I even took pictures of myself aiming the balls. L0L! Anyway, the mid-yr exams are finally over, but the 'O' Lvl Chinese Examinations are coming! But as u all shld noe by now, heck wif it! I'm a full time slacker man, tt's my job! L0L. I haf started planning wad i would be doing the June Holidays. First of all, tuition for A Maths twice a week! I've got to buck up and stop slacking already, L0L! Secondly, swimming twice a week at least too. I've got to train this weak body of mine man before it rots! And Hell No, I'm not gonna let any1 call me white stick or stuffs again! Thirdly, I wanna go play pool as often as I can too, juz for the sake of it and the fun of it. Hehe, I might also be going overseas as well for about a week. I'm not sure where I'll be going yet, might be South Korea, Japan or Kuala Lumpur. I'm juz trill to go to other countries! Finally, on the 22nd of June, when Linkin Park comes to Singapore, I'll be there man! Someway or somehow I'll be watching them perform! Yea, now tt's something to talk about! Well u noe wad i guess tt's bout' my plans. I juz hope my frens or whoever ask me out during the June Holidays often to do something, or else I'll probably be at home doing nothing. And a typical person like me will never ask anyone to go out unless I'm realli dying of boredom. Oh yes, I also haf to go to Coffee Bean and Starbucks! And I'll probably go there wif my primary school fren juz to chill, chat and catch up wif him. Den again, I juz remembered tt there's a new soccer court near my house, so I guess I'll be visiting quite often to kick some balls! I juz remembered something else, I need to update my website during the June Holidays as well as make some cartoons to put them up, so please check out my website ya? Okok, I think I'll stop here for today, chill and peace out guys! =]
