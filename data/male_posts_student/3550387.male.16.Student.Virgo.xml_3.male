Yesterday I spent my whole day with her ( had some tiff but worth it ). The day before, I spent my whole day with her and half of it was acting like a clown -_-" :P As for the day before the day or day before the day's day, absolutely, apparently, unfortunately, what a mishap, my memory fails me.  GUESS WHAT?! Believe it or not, my lao po's mother's friend ( rather long huh?, cutting it short -   "mum's friend" hehe ) saw me accompanying her home! Luckily only that, and nothing else ( praying, burning incense ) *Hope* that her mum doesn't invite me to her house that soon...  Ok that was boring though? now for the real "monotonous part". I MANAGE TO CONTROL MYSELF LOL!!!
