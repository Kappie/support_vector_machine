I think the irony is there were a lot of men and women there in their 30s and 40s that are the original punks weren't dressed like the kids. I say kids, because for the most part it's teenagers that do the mohawk, jackets, etc.    I'm all for freedom of expression, but I think there's a side to trying to look a certain way (that no longer exists) that is ironic. The "look" of the originals were all DIY, you couldn't go to Hot Topic and buy that look. If you're trying to look a certain way, it says something about who you actually are and what the scene has become.   Ok so I didn't really say much about the art at  LACMA  yet.   I mentioned in the previous post about how there is something weird about punk being at the  Autry . I think museums in general are weird, in that that there is a decontextualization of what is actually in the museum from where the art / music came from. It's sort of like the difference between seeing an animal on safari or in a  zoo .   Despite understanding the importance of preservation, I sort of don't like how galleries are decontextualizing of the artwork. Artwork from all over are collected and put in artificial environments with minimal explanation of where they came from. Yes the stuff at LACMA were made to look nice and have some cohesivity. However, I thought the  BeyondGeometry  exhibit didn't really push how the art was really about the epistemological shift from modernism to postmodernism. Instead it was just eye candy, without meaning. This exhibit had far fewer plaques describing the exhibit than the other one on race in Mexico.  The  Inventing Race  exhibit was good. However, I find the periodization of the exhibit weird. They chose a period of time when Englightenment ideals of the rights of man and how that applied racially were a big deal and cut it off at 1790, a year in which those Englightenment ideals were fought for not just for white folk in France, but slaves in Haiti. I think the art work raises a lot of interesting questions about race (and class) in a historical context, that the curators didn't push enough.
