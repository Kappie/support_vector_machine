Am I going to clean it? No! Why? I just don't know!  Anyway, sorry for bringing you boredom and nothing interesting to say, after all I've promised two people an update. Whats that I hear you ask? Two people? Unbelievable, but true, two people now read my blog and demand updates, what is the world coming to eh?  So, I'm going to go to sleep, (thats if I ever get sleep, considering the situation right now) and I will fill you all in about everything in the morning. I can tell you one thing now, that the entry will be called, "Stalking, Lazing, Thunderstorms and Barbeques".  Toodles.
