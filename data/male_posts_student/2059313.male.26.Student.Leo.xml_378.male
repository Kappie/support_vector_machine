Normally, I wouldn't mind AS much, except my small group is going hiking/climbing tomorrow... or correction - today.   I have to be awake in three hours in order to make it to church by 8:00am.   I just wish my body would work with me here.  I've been getting up fairly early to try to impede the progressively later and later nights.  I've stopped drinking a lot of caffine, and I exercise during the day.  I just don't understand.
