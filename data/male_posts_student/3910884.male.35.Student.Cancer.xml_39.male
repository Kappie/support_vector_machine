No shame, it could be rush hour and some guy is peeing on a wall... :)    If forever isn't long enough to love you,   I'd spend another  life time to love you too.    I was feeling a little melancholy today.     Okay so I think this was brought about by a bunch of Filipino R songs being played. The Filipinos have a very romantic culture (sometimes in a fatalistic way!).     Seeing her walk away,  Is like a sad song being sung.    My dad taught me to be old fashioned and to remember the old romantic ways and my mom taught me the importance of being independent and to understand another's need for independence.    Okay so we're in Maruglo. Going to meet with the out-of-school youth this afternoon and then hike up the mountains to meet with the Aetas in Pilien.     Like a Love Song   Her going away,  Like a love song being sung,  My heart weeps inside.     Back in Your Arms   If I can believe,  I'm back in your arms again,  Then that's where I'll end.     Good-Byes   Good-byes are so sad,  No promises between us,  That we'll meet again.     Washed Away   Rain falls from the sky,  The skies display my feelings,  My pain washed away.
