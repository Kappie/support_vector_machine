That's a little bleak in the world, but so much is 'unfair' in our lives that seriously, who decides who deserves something while another person does not?  Anyway... the gym was full and annoying, but I needed to go.  I eventually made my way home to find my cat had broken a dozen things in the apartment.  Cookie jar, glasses, refridgerator.  Well, not really, but she did break the cookie jar.  And I was going to make cookies some day!  But I made my way to Walmart since A) I had nothing better to do 2) I was out of good food III) I wanted soda, aka pop, aka diet coke  I picked up Cindy on the way back and we watched TV for the night, ranging from Newlyweds to HBO (which had a show about anal sex that was disturbing), Who's Line is it anyway?, Who's the boss? and so much more.  I took her home at midnight.  Cindy wants to go to my mom's tonight, tomorrow is my friend's wedding, then we're going to the casino.  Should be fun.
