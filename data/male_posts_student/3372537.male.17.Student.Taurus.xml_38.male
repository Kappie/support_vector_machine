INVADER ZIM. rock. so now i have something like 4 hours of invader zim to watch. come to think of it, i am now confused as to why i am even on my computer in the first place. i could be watching invader zim. but then again, i just watched a movie. stupid stupid stupid. now i am rather fed up and disgusted with the pure idiocy that some people harbor within their few brain cells. whoops, that was mean. now, see, i was going to change my IM screen name because i am sick of and hate mine. however, the only sn i felt like changing to was taken. i'm gonna find out who has it, and steal their identity. lol, not really. actually, i could talk to them online and bitch them out, supposing the sn is still active. okaaaaaaaay. done with that topic. like hell am i gonna talk to some total stranger. hmm, what else interesting goes on in my life. NOT TOO MUCH. augh, oh well. people are out of town. it's odd. they still return to online land. suckers.      i shall now conduct an experiment.    c  o  l  o  r  f  u  l  . all righty then, enough of that. i am so bored. by the way, it is a lot of fun to go to eating-places and keep a live fish on your table. namely, fiyero vincent deagol. other options for fiyero's name included stalker, orc, and balrog. evil things. all right. time to go. good night.       kiss kiss.   and for those of you who don't know the significance of that expression, and i know for a fact that most of you do not, well, it's a Karla thing. And I am sure that that tidbit of information helped you all enormously.
