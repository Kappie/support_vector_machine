It takes a brave man to stand up against the NEA, especially in Kahlifornia.  I would love to see real cuts in education, to force some much needed reform.  We've been throwing more money at it than any other nation in history, with some of the poorest results.  More money won't fix it.  Time to trim it down and find out what works, and that means crushing the union if they won't help improve it.  Ahnuld wasn't my candidate, but I'm happy to see him considering acts like this.
