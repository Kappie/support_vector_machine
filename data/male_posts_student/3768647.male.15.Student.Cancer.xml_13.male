Computer Games are also considered to be a childrens thing right now in India,but slowly it is improving though mainly the elder people consider this a childrens play thing.In fact even when a 15 year old asks for a game they ask "kya tum abhi bhi yeh sub kheltey ho?"(Do you still play all these things).Sorry,iv'e got to go.Will continue this article later.
