Jonah should spell his name right.  Jonah, with your jubilation and your Konversions, one would think you'd have updated your toaster stories. Am I going to have to finish that for you?

I didn't find out till you were talking to Katie in Physiology,   Oh well.  Still happy. Still worried about it. I feel like a content Arthur Dent, or Rincewind.
