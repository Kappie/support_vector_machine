Don't know why I'm listening to such sad depressing songs, I ain't even feeling that bad. Had a good night on Thursday - even if she did keep the lion lol. Just reached into my pocket and pulled out the tracing paper. I guess I'll have to work on that next week.  One thing I knew, is that you love me.  Another thing I knew, is that another loves me. And I'm so sorry. I hope you get over me, and realise that I'm not who you need.  Eels - I Need Some Sleep.  I seriously need therapy.
