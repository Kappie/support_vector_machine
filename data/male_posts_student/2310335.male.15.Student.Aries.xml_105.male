Currently we have only a handful people who have said they're interested in learning PHP, so eGurucool Lab should be the perfect place to have it.  Please post comments regarding any queries and be quick so that we might be able to make appropriate changes. Also, those who're interested, please tell us so in the comments, so we know how many people to expect.  --Karan
