The numbers where extremely close, 48% Kerry, 49% Bush, and 3% unsure if the election was held that day. With Nader it was something like 6% Nader, 43% Kerry, 48% Bush, and still 3% undecided. So more people would vote for Bush. That's not a bad thing but another poll underneith asked people whether they thought Bush  wasn't  doing a good job as president. More people said YES, they thought he  wasn't  doing a good job. Suprising since more people said they would vote for Bush. So they think Bush isn't doing a good job as president, yet they would still vote for him. Wierd.
