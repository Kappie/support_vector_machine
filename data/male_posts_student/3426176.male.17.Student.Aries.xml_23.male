Usually songs are conveniently placed in 3 minute boxes ready to be consumed by the audience.  Usually there are three or four stand out songs and the rest are album fillers.  Usually they are separate songs that don't correlate to each other.    Usually.     Cradle of Filth  destroys that mold with their latest album  Damnation and a Day .  First off, there are 17 tracks on this album.  True some of them are symphonic bridges between songs (more on this later) but the album would be seriously lacking if it weren't for them.  Secondly, these 17 songs take over 76 minutes to play out.  Third, most songs are well over five minutes long, some over six.  Next, every song is just as intense, just as brutal as the previous.  There is never a let down.  And finally and most importantly, this album tells a story.  Each song has a theme and it rolls into the next song much like an epic movie.  Story?  What the hell is this?  What kind of album has a story?  Well, be prepared for something new.   Damnation and a Day  takes on the story of the war between good and evil from the evil (obviously) perspective.  (I must warn you that you really need to know the characters and the stories in the Bible to follow this album's theme)  There are four main chapters:  Fantasia Down, Paradise Lost, Sewer Side Up,  and  The Scented Garden .  Each chapter begins with an orchestral track complete with a 40 piece symphony and 30 choir singers which introduce a new theme in the battle between good and evil.  In a few of these orchestral songs, there is a little narration to set up the stage for the new chapter.  The chapter opens with "A Bruise Upon the Silent Moon" introduces the theme of Lucifer's fall from Heaven's angel to ruler of Hell. (this is the  Fantasia Down  chapter)  "Damned in Any Language (A Plague on Words)" opens the theme of temptation of sin upon humans. (this is the  Paradise Lost  chapter)  "The Mordant Liquor of Tears" displays evils throughout mankind, (this is the  Sewer Side Up  chapter) but also foreshadows the next theme.  "A Scarlet Witch Lit the Season" projects - get this - a love story.  Yes, a love story. (this is  The Scented Garden  chapter)  And so it begins.   Cradle  kicks in.  And they kick hard! "The Promise of Fever" is an unforgiving song that assaults the ears and never lets up.  Lead singer Dani Filth's screams and howls highlight this ominous track.  There is a part where the orchestra builds the energy to a climax and Dani's howl pierces through to bring on the ending assault.  The next song is "Hurt and Virtue".  This track has a very catchy guitar riff that is one of the best on the entire album.  It speeds by until the end where is slows slightly and leads to a dramatic end.  "An Enemy Led the Tempest" has another wonderful guitar riff that blends in wonderfully with the keyboards and the opera singers.  The track changes tempo during the middle, but breaks out to full speed again before the sorrowful agonising ending.  "Better to Reign in Hell" is a track with more brutal guitar that switches to elegant very quickly... Then back to brutal again.  This track also features female backing vocals that adds a hint of eerieness and a 45 second instrumental that is top notch.  "Serpent Tongue" starts with haunting drums and keyboards which enters again in the middle and end of the song.  Dani's whispers are extremely chilling.  "Carrion" sounds alot like a  Slayer  song with an orchestra, opera singers, and piercing screams and howls in the background.  There is another part where Dani whispers scripture and when you least expect it,  Cradle   bursts out in full fury.  "Present from the Poison Hearted" features another excellent guitar riff.  The keyboards are especially chilling in this track.  Dani features great mouth control when he lists names the Devil corrupted rapid-fire.  I mean, any one who can accurately and clearly say Mahalaleel super fast deserves some credit.  The middle part has a relaxing orchestra part that is eventually raped by Dani's howls and the band's brutal playing.  "Doberman (Pharaoh)" starts out with a sitar.  A crushing guitar riff follows with a female voice harmonising with the guitar riff.  Orchestral breaks with Dani's low gravely chants are dispersed throughout this track.  The sitar makes another cameo near the end and the keyboard makes itself known.  "Babalon A.D. (So Glad For the Madness)" is the adjoining song between the  Sewer Side Up  chapter and the  Scented Garden  chapter.  This song starts out crushing, then goes off to another eerie moment before embarking on another ultra-catchy guitar riff.  Then it sounds a little hypnotic until it goes onto the eerie again.  After a while, there is a nifty little jam before the catchy riff again.  Towards the end, the song stops completely and the only thing that is heard is a heartbeat for about a second before the band kicks in again.  This part scares the feces out of me every time.  Next is "Mannequin".  I have heard this song a few times before, but never the whole thing so I kind of knew what to expect.  The video is... strange (of course) but that's not the point.  I never knew what the hell Dani was singing about until I read the lyrics in the book and thought about how it correlates to the theme of the album.  It all makes sense now.  Anyway, this song has one of my favourite guitar riffs on the album and has lovely female backing vocals.  This song has an excellent atmosphere and that is what  Cradle of Filth  is all about.  Song number 15 is "Thank God for the Suffering".  This is one of my favourite songs on the entire album.  Strangely enough it's a love song and quite possibly the closest  Cradle  will ever come to an all out ballad.  It's a great dynamic from the previous songs about sin, Hell, and slaughter.  It's cold, sorrowful, and eerie.  This is the turning point of the theme of the album.  I don't want to give too much away, but this is really the crowning point.  The absolute best part is at the very end where there is chanting which abruptly stops leaving Dani to whisper in the most haunting voice "I thank God for the suffering".  Immediately after "The Smoke of Her Burning" starts and it is a neck breaking change of tempo.  As the last real song on the album this is naturally the final battle between good and evil.  I don't understand how Paul, the guitarist, did not break his wrist off from playing so fast.  He really has to be playing about a million notes per second.  This is also another memorable guitar riff. (how many is that?)  Towards the end, the song slows from the mindblowing speed and produces one of my favourite line of lyrics ever: "Weld the gates to Heaven shut/ The abyss leers in hissing ruts/ Unhilt the black grimoire of death/ Inscribe all names God has left."  The band fades out, thunder rolls, the orchestra plays with a sorrowful tone, and the choir sings ominously.  The final track "End of Daze" enters and it closes with thunder, wind howling, and the last narration with evil laughter that fades away and brings this epic album to an end.  The only thing I neglected to talk about is the drumming.  Adrian puts together the performance of his life.  The double bass pounding is consistent and the snare sounds like a machine gun. (listen to "Mannequin" for an example)  He uses the ride cymbal, high hat, and crashes appropriately so they each add different characteristics to a song.  And I will never know how Dani can change his voice from glass shattering high to ground shaking low so quickly.  You may not like the style of singing, but it is amazing how seamlessly he goes back and forth.  Some people may say this is not music.  Well they are right.  It is something so much more.  It truly is an epic.   Cradle  certainly had lots of balls to try and make an album like this.  Concept albums usually don't work, but they made it perfect.  The story alone is very intriguing.  Each song is excellent when listened to on their own, but they are only fully appreciated when they are listened to completely all the way through in the wee hours of the night while reading the lyrics.   Damnation and a Day  has raised the bar of heavy metal to dizzying heights.  Maybe the only way this album can be topped is by  Cradle of Filth  themselves.   Cradle of Filth  -  Damnation and a Day   Sony Music (2003) 17 tracks (76:53)    Dani "Filth" Davey: Vocals Paul Allender: Guitar Adrian Erlandsson: Drums Dave Pybus: Bass   Immortal songs:  "Hurt and Virtue", "Better to Reign in Hell", "Thank God for the Suffering", "The Scent of Her Burning"  100 out of 100.
