This time his mentor was doing the NWCN Northwest Sports Tonight show.  So he got there about 5 and they were already working on the show putting together clips and stories, etc.  Well once the Sonics game rolled around at 6 Tyke got put to work.  He logged the game which just means he watched the game and marked down the time of special plays and the score and other things having to do with the game.  So that kept him busy for about 2 and a half hours.  Then after that he did some more tasks for the 2 guys doing the show.  These tasks included just searching for stuff and finding stats and such for games happening during the day.  Then when his mentor was ready they compiled the Sonics game information and Tyke told him the clips to use and helped write what he was gonna say for the show.  So the Sonics highlight was hugely a Tyke Turner masterpiece.  This is really fun.  He is finding out that this career really is for him and that he is also pretty good at it from what he can tell.  Tyke could go back tomorrow if he wanted, and his mom is pretty vehement about him doing so, but Tyke wants to just take a day off and try and not have his vacation go by too quickly.  Already a day has gone by and he didn't see any friends.  And he hasn't hung out with any girls in a while either.  So that is tops on his agenda.  Laters gators.
