I had muscle ache on my calves… woke up to apply the muscle cream on my legs.. anyway, I thought I would be late for school today.. but, surprisingly, I wasn’t… there wasn’t any traffic jam and I got there on time..  Class today was boring… kena my pem 3 hour lesson… reporting his words again and again… anyway.. I smsed my darling a lot of times today.. however, I got only a few replies… and the replies often were not longer than a page.. somehow, I told her that I thinkone of the girls in my class isn’t as attractive that I think she was… her tone.. I gather that she was jealous and angry.. her tone told  me all that.. however, I dare not jump to any assumptions… after all, she’s right.. why was I looking at that girl in the first place? Stupid me… haiz..  My school today.. had this cca orientation thing.. I stayed back to look at the ccas… I took an interest in the soccer, ambassadorial team and the aikido club… on the way home, it stared raining.. when it reached the bus stop, it was drizzling.. so I took a run… I hugged my bag.. cos I didn’t wan my notes to get wet… my pants were too big… and, it sort of slipped… I pulled it up and continued running.. when I reached home, I took a shower.. whn I came out of the shower, darling was already home.. but I was reading some notes so I delayed calling her.. when I called her, I was talking bout the cca’s… I told her I wanted to join the soccer team.. immediately said no.. I was shocked.. I thought she would support me in whatever I do… and then the ambassadorial team.. she asked me what is it… I tried to explain… I really tried… but I couldn’t… then she smth… she said..  okay never mind… I’m not interested… I felt so sad.. haiz… feel so lost..
