I don't mind when I've gone shopping with ex girlfriends or even when I accidentally get dragged into by female friends. However, when I have to do it myself... it just makes me feel fucking uncomfortable.  Here are some reasons why: 1) Realizing that I too am materialistic and superficial. Clothing is and has been one of the most basic things that delineate social class. Like Roman robes! I'm buying into the motherfucking capitalist system! Shit I even looked around South Coast Plaza for something! 2) Dealing with sales people. Fuck I want them to just leave me alone. 3) The time consuming aspect of finding something that fits and looks good. The thing with nice clothes is that they have to fit to look good. The biggest problem with my build is that I have pretty wide shoulders given the build of the rest of my body.  When I was going through suits it took forever to find something that fit me decently. 4) Spending money on something superfluous. 5) Parking at malls suck. Anyway.. I have a nice new suit after hours of work. I don't feel fulfilled though.  I should perhaps nap for a while.  **
