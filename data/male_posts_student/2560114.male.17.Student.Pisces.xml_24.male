Just think of how hard i tried to please u...think of all the times we hung out, talked on the phone, online, and other thangz. Ive done everything for u, ur like the most beautiful girl, ur like exactly my type, we do thingz alike, we do like everything together...u dont know how much u mean to mean, u dont know how much i care about u, but u do know how much i love u...so if its not gonna work out...so b it, if it is...awesome...you will never...ever...meet a guy like me...guys like me just come and go, very rare...so if u still like him...so b it, i felt like a fought for nothing, and it hurtz....really hurtz...so just think about these thingz...think hard...the answers will come...if they dont, then ur missing out...if u just opened ur eyes, and c whats right in front of u...just think  ....thnx john
