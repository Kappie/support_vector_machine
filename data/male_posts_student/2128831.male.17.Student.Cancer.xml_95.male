Tour de Bubble Butt. French men tend to be un-cut. I'm okay if they know how to fuck, Plus some old fashion hoovering suck. Great sex don't need a thousand bucks, All you need is MY bubble butt.  Not that I wish for sex, but it was a ramble of thoughts and that came out.  To a special someone: Seize upon that moment long ago  One breath away and there you will be  So young and carefree  Again you will see  That place in time...so gold  Steal away into that way back when  You thought that all would last forever  But like the weather  Nothing can ever...and be in time  Stay gold  But can it be  When we can see  So vividly  A memory  And yes you say  So must the day  Too, fade away  And leave a ray of sun  So gold  Life is but a twinkling of an eye  Yet filled with sorrow and compassion  though not imagined  All things that happen  Will age too old  Though gold
