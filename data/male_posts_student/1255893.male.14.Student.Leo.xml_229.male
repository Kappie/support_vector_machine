I got to the mall at around 2:40. Met up w/ Nathen and waited w/ him for Kelley and Ave to arrive. So Then the two of them show up, big hugs all around, and all that mushy stuff I wuv. We walk to see the puppies at Petworld. Those puppies are adooooooooorable!! I was sooooo giddy =P. Then we go into that cheap lil photo booth thingy near there. I'll scan those later. I actually came out good too, so that was kewl. Umm, I think we visited a few stores, bought food, and all that good stuff. The best part though, was when we sat down in the furniture aisle at JCPenny. For most of the time I was resting my head on Kelley's lap. I don't think I've ever been petted so much. It felt great though. I could have stayed there for hours on end. At the same time I was kinda playin footsie w/ Ave. I need to hang out w/ Nathen more too. That boy is amazing. Then we looked at the time and it was like... 3 minutes 'til we had to go. So we got up and left. Mmmm, I felt really... relaxed. I wuv those guys. Lets do it again soon.  I should go burn Kelley's Cd now. I'm off.
