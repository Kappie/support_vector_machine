My mind is really blank right now and i dont even remember what happened at school. The only thing that im really thinking about is DC and the great time im hopeing to have. I get to do this wreath laying ceremony thing at the tomb of the unknown soldiers (i think thats where it is). Me and 3 other ppl got picked out of my class of around 97 so thats kinda going to be exciting. Now i got to get into hyper gear and start packing....   For the world of Sports............ My sharks are leading 3-0 against the Colorado Avalanche in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. My favorite player (Marleau) has 7 goals i think and leads the league in goals. They will try to sweep the series tomorrow....... My Giants SUCK right now.........yesterday they finally pulled off a win but they still find themselves at the bottom of their division. Its all good though b/c its only the beginning of the season.   11 RULES FOR LIFE: I really Like #11  RULE 1: Life is not fair, get used to it.  RULE 2: The world won’t care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.  RULE 3: You will NOT make $40,000 a year right out of high school. You won’t be vice president with a car phone until you earn both.  RULE 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss. He doesn’t have tenure.  RULE 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger-flipping; they called it opportunity.  RULE 6: If you mess up, it’s not your parents’ fault, so don’t whine a about your mistakes, learn from them.  RULE 7: Before you were born, your parents weren’t as boring as they are now. They got that way from paying your bills, cleaning your clothes and listening to you talk about how cool you are. So before you save the rain forest from the parasites of your parents’ generation, try "delousing" the closet in your own room.  RULE 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. In some schools, they have abolished failing grades; they’ll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. This doesn’t bear the slightest resemblance to ANYTHING in real life.  RULE 9: Life is not divided into semesters. You don’t get summers off and very few employers are interested in helping you find yourself. Do that on your own time.  RULE 10: Television is NOT real life. In real life people actually have to leave the coffee shop and go to jobs.  RULE 11: Be nice to nerds. Chances are you'll end up working for one.  I think ill blog one last time tommorrow or ill blog on Thursday.........bye
