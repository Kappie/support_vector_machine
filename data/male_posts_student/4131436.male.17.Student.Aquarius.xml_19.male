I can see by the way she reacts man.. Totally ignoring me.. TOTALLY!.. I'm bumped out bout Jenni.. She's like the only one for me man.. But why must she reacts this way? Is it because of exams? Just because of exams we can't even communicate??! What's up with that?! I don't know why she reacts this way.. Maybe she doesn't have the heart for me anymore? I don't know man... She took part in Sport's Day today at school.. She didn't win..But, luckily she never fall down.. Even though she didn't win in the singles running.. She earned a medal (1st) for class relay.. Hope she's happy with that... But I just cannot take the fact she totally ignoring me man... We like each other last time but why now? *SiGhZz* I guess I've already shown the White-Flag to her... I've lost the war... Not once but twice..... :'( Above all.. I didn't had a great day today... Full of emotions and sadness.... When I see her...I feel like letting my tears out of my eyes... aRgHhH!!! I guess it's goobye to Jenni....I'm sorry for what I did in the past that hurt you..Please forgive and forget me k? I can't write more now... Probably tomorrow then... Sorry ya'll.. See ya!
