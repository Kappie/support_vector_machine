Wonderland in entirely in her head....She is on an acid trip) The Wizard of Oz    This list is subject to being updated whenever the fuck I feel like it. If you have not seen these movies...you are in danger of being made fun of by me. ESPECIALLY if your a guy who hasn't seen Die Hard....thats just gay....TOTALLY GAY
