My cousins came over with my uncle and we hung out for a few hours. Then I had to clean my whole room which was a mess so it took awhile. My sister and her boyfriend are coming to stay here tonight like at 3:30 AM, and he is sleeping in my bed. So it has to be all clean and all that, and I had to move some of my stuff up to my brothers room. After that, we went over to Peoria and went to church at St. Vincint de Paul. It's always packed there so I had to stand the whole time. Which isn't that bad actually, I kinda like it. After church we went over to the new mall and I bought some awesome Puma's because I needed new shoes, I wanted some Addias from Gallians, but no they didn't have them, stupid Gallians. And guess what, Footlocker didn't have them either, but my Puma's are cool so it all works out. Then we went to Old Navy and I found a shirt for a dollar and 79 cents. Now that is a deal. It was the ugliest thing I have ever seen, it was a brown long sleve kinda sweater/shirt thing. I didn't buy it, but I thought it was cool that it was only $1.79. Then we went to the CAT store because my dad wanted a new shirt. I found that CAT has some hott shoes, but they were like 90 bucks. But they were the coolest things ever, when I start working soon, I'm gonna buy a pair. They are hott. Then we went to Sams, for no apparent reason, were there, and were just like, "why are we here?" So we left and then went to Cubs and my mom bought some stuff. And then we came home, and had Taco Bell for dinner. After that, I went outside and played basketball with my dad, and then Amanda came over and we talked for about an hour. She was cold, and lied and said she wasn't! lol you are awesome Amanda! After she left I just came inside where I am now. Really bored. Just listening to music. My fav. Brand New is playing right now. You have to love them, they are just that amazing. Well I need sleep, have a great night! Aloha!
