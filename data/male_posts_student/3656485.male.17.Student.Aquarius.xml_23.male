Good idea, Chris!  so my glasses came in yesterday, and I must say, sucksta. I truly apreciate my contacts for their superior qualities. When you wear a pair of glasses you have to turn your entire head to look out of what might only otherwise be the corner of your eye. I find it quite annoying. but on the upside, it doesn't take a minute to install them. Enough of that, on to something else.  I'm headed in to Best Buy today to try and con one of the managers into giving me an interview. Maybe they'll see me walking in and decide to give me the job right on the spot. Yeah, that's prolly what'll happen... My biggest fear about getting the job would be talking to Sue (my manager over at DQ). I think the ensuing conversation as I gave her my two weeks notice might potentially be deadly. Can't tell for sure though, I only hear things. Damn you, rumors!  Ballacrosse will be this Thursday at 6:00 PM. You should come. I won't be your friend if you don't. Well, maybe, but you'll need to give me a dollar to make up for it.  My brother thinks he is gangster now. What a strange kid. He also spends more time with the Mexican family down the street than with ours. I'm not really depressed about it right now. But when he comes back for school... Even more gangsta rap to feel through the floor boards.. W00T...  I like making new friends sometimes. This feels like one of those days. If I don't know you, maybe we should get together some time. We'll do lunch.
