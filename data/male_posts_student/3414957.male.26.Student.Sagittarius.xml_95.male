           
      I am not staying that late tonight. I do not have to and should not feel like I have to. I spend too much time here. I am gonna call a friend later after work. I just think I am a sucker with feelings. Damn, I need to supress those stupid things. I only try to do good and you no what they say...Only the good die young! Thats not going to be me; not if I can help it.
