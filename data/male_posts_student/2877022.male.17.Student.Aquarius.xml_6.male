Hey let's all make Elsa a nick-name,  The way she's playing this match-making game,   How about mean gal number one?  I don't like her teasing me about eventually having a son!   Elsa what u said made my heart simply torn,  You must realise i'm just like Jimmy Neutron!   Understand that i'm not a love-seeking bird,  The way you say stuff proclaims me as a desperate.  !@^$*$%#$@   Lyrics by: Janet the Mighty
