(On a separate note, if you're still visiting this blog after the long pause of creativity, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I hope to address the matter in Iraq as soon as I can gather enough information to not sound as ignorant about this whole matter as I really am.  I'll have to start doing my research on the Gulf War, oil, Saddam, Gulf War Syndrome, and the entire Middle East in history.  But as this next post will show you, I wouldn't have the time to even learn to spell some of the names I should know in Iraq.)  Every year, the all the children in all the middle schools in San Francisco (and God knows where else) go to an assembly.  The stage is decorated in disco lights, scooters, mini bikes, coolers, little useless trinkets, magazine cover shots, an oversized picture of Austin Powers in his classic "Oh, behave" pose, and a gigantic money booth.  An over-enthusiastic representative enters stage left.  This guy has all the zeal of a baby seal suicide bomber with his headset microphone, fast-talking, speedy movements, and cheesy jokes and mind games. The first two words that come out of his mouth:  " Magazine drive... "  The brainchild of Reader's Digest rears its ugly head again to put thousands of prize hungry children to work.  The "family" of the child selects from hundreds of magazines, books, CDs, and toys.  The "parents" (as in anyone the kid can find, regardless if they're a murderer or child molester) sign a number of copies of sheets, the kids add in the necessary information and give it to a school official the next morning for prizes.  Every two tickets (tickets being the orders from the molester-- I'm sorry, "parents") is a different level for prizes.   The levels and prizes are too numerous to mention, but out of all the crap the representative feeds us, no prize is so diabolical as the 2-ticket "weepole" (spelling suggestions welcome, no one can actually spell that).  It's a fucking fuzz ball glued to feet and googly eyes, and every year, they have new ones.  I thought I had seen the worst they had to offer, but this year, they introduced Patriot Weepole.  You heard me...   Patriot .........  Weepole .........  Let the shock run over you just a bit...  It'll take some time... I'm here for you, don’t worry...  It's a purple piece of lint with googly eyes and a big ol' American flag.  I'm quite grateful that the body is purple, if it were white, I would instantly smell something wrong.  I was already sick of the American flags everywhere you turn, and when I had thought I was safe and the country was going back to hating our president, here comes a piece of fuzz telling me the exact opposite. And it wasn't so much the fact that it was there, or the fact that 85% of the audience applauded their hearts out at the site of it, it was that the first thought I had was of  the slave labor put into each and every one of these things .  I know that volunteers probably made the weepoles (please, let it be so), but I can't help but think about that.  The presentation was over and the happy mob left with their information packets.   I'm aware of how much this helps the school, and how Readers Digest was being generous to us, but I can't get over how scary this all is.  I hope one day they all (I don’t mean to ride in on my high horse, I'm a huge sucker) wake up and laugh at how stupid we were for going out into the world with pamphlets in hand an prizes in mind just like little Jehovah's Witnesses.  All I can really say is that this is the final stage in brainwashing the fresh 6th graders.  Go America.....  We'll read as long as it involves prizes.....
