Mood:  bored. Music: POD - Set Your Eyes To Zion.  All today was was a bunch of homework. PERIOD. Just homework, eating. BORING. Yep, its 2:33 right now, tonight I have to work out with Paul, don't laugh! That picture of me is me not flexing, soon I'll have a pic of me FLEXING! I'm so skinny so I look like I'm Arnold Shwartzeneiger. My muscles pop out big time, you gotta see it. As soon as Paul sends the pic to me you all will see Mr. Muscoli! Ok, forget about the muscles, god I'm so depressed it's Sunday and tomorrow there's school again. I hate school, more than anyone else because I like being free and not held captive in a shithole such as school where it takes 5 fuckin days for you to change a class because the office has a bunch of retards that can't do anything right! That's all, later everyone. Oh wait no! I got a job! I get to babysit every Tuesday and Thursday at my sort of neighbor's house, the Dimotsis'. Their house occupies two little wankers at the age of I think 9 and 10. But their insanely wild, but I'm friends with them so it shouldn't be hard. I get payed about 7 bucks an hour, well I will get payed, so it's pretty awesome. I finally am making some MONEY! Ok later.    Saturday, September 6th, 2003  Subject: Good Old Aflac Time: 10:54 pm. Mood:  cheerful. Music: Limp Bizkit - Eat You Alive.  Oh good old Aflac to finish off the night. But first let me explain what happened yesterday in school. In English, Mcloughlin and I were dying the whole class. This teacher gets funnier and funnier every day, not her, her voice. She sounds so nervous. It's so great. Then she made us get into groups and have one person describe a picture to 2 other people and the people had to draw what it was without seeing the picture, only by me telling them what to draw. But she said no body language so I did a pelvic thrust in my seat when she wasn't looking, heh funny? Then Kevin and I were dying laughing when this one kid drew a star who's face was all stoned looking, his eyes were like horizontal lines and same with his mouth, it was so great. Ya English is awesome. There's alot of quiet people in my classes, it's so fuckin' depressing. Then in AP Euro, Ferrante had to get all our names right and the only name he remembered right off the bat was O'CONNOR! He called Ruby, Rubystone. Also, he said Jack Geiger, ah yes, Geiger Counter. Some girls told Mr. Ferrante to remember Grimaldi by mold, which depressed me...I don't want to be mold. But eh, what the hell? I might be better off decomposed. Of course the grand of the day, lunch. Where we all died of laughter again. This time it was more laughing than ever and Ryan G made me spit out my Yoo-Hoo. Their objective is to make me laugh and spit out my drink. I have a feeling I'm going to be spitting out alot this year. Uh...nothing else in school really. At night, I worked out with Paul, and Kaiser and Joe Bennett was there. Then I was supposed to go to the movies with Jay Hoffman but no girls could go. Then Keith invited me over to sleep over. We played Ghost Recon: Island Thunder non stop. Game is off thaaa hook. Then next day we basically rode into town, bought a shit load of Red Bull and it seriously doesn't work. We saw these dudes, those little kids I told you are punks that like starting fights, one of them had a low rider bike thingy that's in the gay good charlotte video. Notice I don't capitalize good charlotte, they're not good enough for capitals, only God is or Jesus, and Tool. Like you mention Jesus, you say, What a great man He was. Haha it was so funny, Keith goes, "Tom this bridge can only hold up to 10 tons, Tom you can't come on this bridge." around 4 where Steve, Keith, Mike and I went to the field hockey game. Keith met Rachel there. They did stuff together. I ignored them the whole time and played with those wacky 11th grade boys, ya know, my crew...Pat and Dan and Jimmy and Eric, and Chris Corby and his French friend named Cuntan but I liked crueton better so I called him crueton. Gavin and some other kid was there too. We played ultimate frisbee. It was so great Chris goes, "Is that Eric? Wait, no...that's 3 women." Then the boys had to go, and I was alone with Keith and his girls...and Mike too. Not that hanging with Keith and Mike is bad. Just it was boring as hell. But it was good because I watched Mike float in mid air and he taught me how to float sideways against poles. It's so cool. Ok, then I went back to Keith's, then home, then nothing, back to Aflac, Brian from Boston reminded me of him. Oh yes, he's close to god. Ok later.    Thursday, September 4th, 2003  Subject: Damn Bus! Time: 6:43 pm. Mood:  pessimistic. Music: Tool - Hush and Alien Ant Farm - These Days.  Ok this sucks, I miss the bus the second day of school because the old fucker comes 20 minutes early. I'm ready to blow this guy's head off with a shotgun, Ryan C and I both wanna kill him. He's crazy and doesn't know what the hell he's doing and looks like Nigel Powers from the side. Anyways, my mom drove me and the whole day went by so slow. I'm so damn exausted and it's only the second day of school. I'm sick of it, I hate it, I wanna be free! Fuck this all, what's the fuckin' sense of school, so we can grow up being smart geeks so we can build machines that will one day conquer us? I mean seriously, all this shit we learn is useless, except war class, Dan C told me about it, I'm definetly doing that next year. I'm just so sick of it, why is school the law? And what the hell, how do people expect others to figure out how to work this fucker. God damnit they even said send us something sexy! Gay homos on their knees beggin' for more. I have this dumb map I gotta completely detailize for AP Euro. I think I should drop out with Tim R. Lunch was the only great part of the day, oh yea checking out that Maggio girl in Math is great too. In lunch I sat with Heaton, Paul, Kyle M, and Ryan G. We basically made each other die of laughter the whole time. I made James spit out his drink right next to his girlfriend. I said go make out with your flanket. Flanket, came from me thinking James said flanket when he really said wanket. Don't ask wtf it means. I can't wait for tomorrow's lunch. I miss the times with Joe Mattia, Nick C and Paul in science. It's all gone...but our best years are yet to come...I hope. Another thing, what the hell's the sense of school if you grow up and you're rich but you have an impossible job and your miserable the rest of your life. Think about it, what's the sense of school, it's basically blinding us from the best years of our lives. After school, nothing's fun anymore and your just living. Right now, I want to set a couple of C4 charges in every high school in the US!!! Wow...I just typed a shitload of cruel stuff...but I deleted it, it might have offended many people's beliefs so I decided to get rid of it. But the main subject was, fuck authority, fuck god, fuck superiority, why the hell are we here, and who is in control of us? I don't believe it's god, there's a superior race living in a world completely different, with obvious answers, where maybe time doesn't even exist. Where freedom rains upon them all. We are rats in a jail, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Sorry if I depressed you, my mood is pessimistic so I'm insulting and critizing everything. Ok tomorrow I'll probably be back to happy, I mean right now I'm not depressed, just too into thought like usual. Ok bye.    Wednesday, September 3rd, 2003  Subject: First Day of School Time: 4:04 pm. Mood:  happy. Music: Billy Talent - Try Honesty.  Ok, it wasn't at bad as I thought it would be. In fact, I sort of liked it, ya know seeing all these faces and stuff. Much more exciting than the summer in some ways. In other ways, no. Oh well, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to deal with school whether we like it or not. So first things first, if you wanna read my past journal go to www.tommygoo.blogspot.com. That's where the old stuff is at. Now back to school. Jesus christ the bus was packed to the very last seat. I sat with Jason Chierchi (right spelling?) and Paul sat with Laura Jean. It sucked how many freshman were invading our bus. So we got to school, in the homeroom, nothing special happened. 1st period, awesome Italian teacher, Mrs. Tifi...something. Anyways she's awesome. 2nd period, I have Ms. Baino or something, she looks like she's from The Simpsons and it's her first year here so she sweats and sounds really nervous when she talks to the point where she sounds like she's about to burst out crying. 3rd period, I have AP Euro with Matthew Kaizor, some teacher named Mr. Ferrante, Jimmy Smith told me he was awesome so I guess I'm set. O'Connor was raising the roof in that class. Who else, ah yes, Hunsucker and Geiger. 4th period sucked, I had to go to the FC for Studio In Media Arts, this class looks ok but I'd rather do Film Making and Chef's Choice II which I think I'm gonna change to tonight if I can. Plus, there's all these freshman I don't know in that class. 5th period and 6th, Biology with Mrs. Laird, she's awesome. Then the day starts to get good as I enter the G Cafe at 7th period with Paul Stoltz, Mike Heaton, James Desimone, John Donlan, Chris Fletcher, Keith Buckheit and Steve Asti. Tomorrow I'll be sitting with the jock dudes, where Keith and Steve are sitting. Thank god Paul, Heaton, Keith and Steve are there. This lunch should be interesting. Plus, we're all gonna hop around to different cafes. Now this is the best period of the day besides lunch, 8th period, Math, Mr. Lynch. I got Schreck, some hot girls including Nicole Indelicato and Marissa Porcello, AJ ZENNY, Stevo but then I got two seats away from me...the scariest thing ever...Keith Fitzgibbons. Thank you Mr. Lynch, haha I heard this teacher is awesome so I'm going to show alot of respect for this guy. See teachers don't understand if they want respect, they gotta be nice to their kids. All of my teachers are nice so far...let's see how it turns out in a few months. Finally I have Ms. Kallabza for 9th period Concert Band. I saw Nelson for the first time since last year, that was pretty cool. I also saw Winksi. Uh...and Paul and Matt I basically hung out with. Bus ride home was cool, not many people thanks to sports. And uh...now I'm here, finishing all these papers, going to the store soon for school supplies of course, and then I'm gonna make some kick ass homemade cookies with my mom. Hopefully I can get her to get me a different class than Studio In Media Arts. My social life is starting again, as goes for many others. In the summer, there's nothing to talk about and nobody is talking, now everyone is talking, it's cool and makes me happy. I'm a happy boy. I'm very happy. Watch 2 days from now, I HATE SCHOOL!!! Haha hopefully school treats me good. Ok later. Oh and since the current music doesn't give you much space to put anything, I've been listening to alot of Rush, then I listen to Thin Lizzy - The Boys Are Back In Town, Mr. Roboto and Renegade by Styx thanks to Dan, a shit load of Led Zeppelin, you know all the rock there is basically. But of course I've been listening to TOOL the most.
