My two current goals (like my Froshie goals of Learning to nasema Kiswahili wa Atakalam Arabiiyah bi-talaqah, or my Sophmore goal of becoming a complete and total Socialist revolutionary) are to- Firstly, be able to have control of my dreams.  Secondly, to be able to astrally project (Out of Body Experience).  Internal, but they have practical applications to reality, and I believe enough people have talked about them for me to think them real.  Lot of effort though.  School.  Ick.
