I have heard many stories of its great amount of ludicrus items, scuch as selling a town, though i had not really belived them until today. I saw for sale a BROKEN camera priced at $26.50. Now, i know you may by stuff on eBay like a used wedding gown but a BROKEN camera? Maybe i am overreacting, but i would like if all you people could write in with your weird eBay stories.
