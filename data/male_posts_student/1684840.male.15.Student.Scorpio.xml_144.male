You know, when your at school you don't wanna be there, but when your at home, you do.  Can't win can any way...  My Splash Plastic keeps messing up so I can't buy the Lost Prophets ablum argh!!  I want it now!!  Harry Potter movie will be out soon, can't wait for that.  Will be kool to inject some magic into reality again.  I keep thinking I should re-read the books again; I might do that sometime.  The Day After Tomorrow looks good, might watch that too.  I've managed to collect the £20 I owe Grandma and Grandad for the MP3 Player so from now on I just have to pay back £30 for the Telescope Shell bought me and save up £15 so I can buy the upcoming Avril Lavigne album and the Harry Potter Soundtrack for the 3rd movie... (what!  I like the music lol)  Since getting my MP3 player I have been listening to the radio loads!  I'm becomming a radio-holic.  It's actually quite entertaining listening to discussions and kool songs.  I'm so pleased with this MP3 Player!
