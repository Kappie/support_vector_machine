It ended with... well... take a gander.  mralexpants: you dont know who tim kasher is, so you dont know crap about music WrathS01: emo? mralexpants: yes mralexpants: sorta WrathS01: see there u go. WrathS01: i dont care to know about emo. WrathS01: all music is emotional mralexpants: emo isnt just "emotional" WrathS01: then what is it? describe it in another wrod mralexpants: emo cant really be described mralexpants: it's more of a way of life than just a type of music WrathS01: neither can most music without emotional WrathS01: and rock or rap isnt a way of life? mralexpants: no, you're not understanding mralexpants: and rap isnt music WrathS01: it is to 3/4 of the world. mralexpants: 3/4ths of the world doesnt know musioc the ory, though mralexpants: so they're just basing stuff off of things they dont know WrathS01: thats not even a complete sentence.
