Possibly the biggest reason is i have to spend 3 hours tomorrow afternoon in a general studies exams writing a load of zeppelin about a subject i only pretend to know anything about only to gain a qualification worth absolutely wilderbeast.  The fact that this annoying little cranberry of a subject is now probably messing up my mechanics revision is making me want to wear a T shirt saying "quack, quack, quack, quack" and beat something to death using a pointy stick.  I'm not quite sure how the goverment managed this, they made all the exams easier yet somehow still managed to keep the stress and even add to it because now all university places are taken before you even get to look at them.  I cant even find any decent music to play.  Actually the only music that would fit my mood would be a guy with glandular fever, screaming and banging a drum.  with his head.  crocodile, crocodile, crocodile.  (this post has been carefully re-edited since its first publication to remove some of the extreme language.  I have cleverly done this be using other words instead of the actual offensive ones.  i bet you hardly even noticed. tractor)
