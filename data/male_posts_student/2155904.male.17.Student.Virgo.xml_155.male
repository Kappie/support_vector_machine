After school Tyke took home Purdy and that was fun as usual.  Tyke would like to be able to take her home everyday because it is fun to drive with another person rather than on one's own.  Like Tyke does most everyday (other than at lunch).  It would be nice to carpool with someone.  Er, someone who Tyke hangs out with anyway that is.  Not just anyone.  The drive home was pretty quick though and then Tyke went on his way home.  Tyke got a call from Naan very soon after he came to his own house asking if he was going to the baseball game and whether he would like to be picked up by her and her ladies.  So he waited til about 3:40 and Skippy came over.  Then about 15 minutes later Naan and the gang came and they all went to the game at Sly Lion.  It was a pretty decent game.  But Tyke and Skippy ended up pretty much sitting by themselves so it wasn't like it was a total blast.  It was just fine.  Tyke was forced by his carpool situation, and Purdy and Tina's inability to drive him home, to leave the game early so he got home and waited for a little while.  Then he left for the school and the concert.  He got out and then Purdy drove up so he sat in her car and basically watched her eat for a while before they went inside.  It was not much fun so after much persistence, Skippy convinced Haras to come with him and Tyke and leave.  She obliged and the three headed out with Tyke's arms over both of them.  Then Tyke took his arm off of Skippy (*cuz he's a guy).  Then Tyke went home.  And he got a lot and a lot (*a lot) of change from his house.  Mounds and mounds of change.  As his away message says right now he got a 30 square inch container completely filled with change.  Around $75 in change.  That is going to be sick when he gets all that money in bill form.  Just sick.  He doesn't really want to Coinstar it and lose 8% of the money to that but he doesn't really have any other means to get all of that money into bill form so he can easily use it.  Any suggestions?  Yeah, today would have been a great day if Tyke had a girlfriend to drive around to all the places he went.  Or a girl that had interest in him that he could drive around to all the places he went.  Or just a girl that he could drive around to all the places he went.  Get the picture?  Yeah, you should.  Damn.
