He said he quite b/c God was telling him band was getting in the way. First off, we don't practice that much and it's for only 2 1/2 more months. NOT BIG DEAL! Anyways, Pat (our drill writer) forgot to write me in the drill. So now I am marching in Chris's spot. Big Problem! One saxaphone marching w/ a bunch of brass members. lol Oh well I guess.     So guess who I like? Well you all heard me talking about Josh. I met Josh @ the Abbey when I went w/ Jeremy like a week ago. Jeremy calls me last night and tells me he is going to a party @ David's. After getting in this big argument w/ my parents (what's new) I convinced my mom to let me go stay the night w/ Jeremy. No harm in letting her not know the whole truth. lol I borrowed the car b/c I didn't want Jeremy to have to take me home @ 9 in the morning. The bad thing was that I had to home by 6:45 in the morning to give the car back to my mom. Besides that...I call Jeremy and ask him if Josh can come. Josh and I have been talking and I tought it would be fun if he came. So he did. I picked him up and MY GOD! did we flirt. All the way in the car. We got there early so we drove around a lil bit. After that we parked where we were suppose to meet Jeremy. I opened up the sun roof and we both sat up in the car and watch pretty much nothing. It was so cute. Then b4 I knew it I turn my head to look @ something and when I turn back I get the most romantic/unexpected kiss. WOW! That boi can kiss. Jeremy gets there and we go to the party. We had a great time and we layed down for a while and just talked. It was a great conversation. We discussed plans for next week. I honestly can't wait for us to get together again. I like this boi so much.
