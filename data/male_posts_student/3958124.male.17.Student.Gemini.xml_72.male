Guess t? Yeah, well, go to hell.  Travis Harris, the jolly young man some of you may have  urlLink seen  with short hair, has signed on. I'd like to take this time to welcome him to the team, which is now completely devoid of "I." I'm sure having him here will, if anything, increase the posting output. YAY!  In other, more interesting news, I sat around the house today and did diddley squat.  Less nothing, sooner.
