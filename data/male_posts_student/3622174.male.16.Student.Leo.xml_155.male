Could it be that my addiction to Blogger is dying down, after almost two whole months of doing nothing but blogging?  Maybe.  But, keep in mind that I shall not be ditching this blog anytime in the next few years.  Nope, gotta keep going with it.   You know what irritates me?  My dad wanted to drop me off at my school this morning at 6:30 so I could do my yearbook work.  Well, I didn't have to be there until nine.  What was he expecting me to do for those 2 and a half hours? I'm not sure, but it was crazy.  So I said screw it, I'm going back to sleep.  I'll be at the school at around 10-ish.  It's the best I can do, I wasn't going to sit up there doing nothing for two and a half hours.  Doesn't work that way.  I just hope that it's not the same way for the next two days for senior pictures, because I'm not getting there at 6:30, and it is crucial that I am there by 9.  8 will work, but 6:30 just doesn't cut it.  Today me and Alex are going to sell yearbooks, and I'm also going to do what Mrs. Yearbook Advisor tells me to, if there's anything else.  I want to play around with InDesign a little more, so that I can get a little better knowledge of what is to come with creating this year's yearbook.  My intent is to create these high-end layouts.  Back at Camp Orlando, I went to this "Breakout" session called "Visual Design," which told us that magazine-style layouts were the thing this year.  I want to play around with that idea, and see if I can pull it off.   My new cell phone is still MIA.  My mom called the Nextel place yesterday, and they said that the one they were shipping turned out defective, so they're refurbishing it, and it should be at my dad's office next Tuesday.  So, oh joy, I get to wait another week.  I hate my p.o.s. cell phone that I currently use.  It's huge, out of date, and looks like crap.  My new one has a color screen, internet, GPS (though I don't think I'll use that), polyphonic ringtones, and all sorts of other things that my current one (the Motorola i30sx model) doesn't have!  My number won't change, since I'm already on Nextel, which is good, because this one is easy to remember.   Lately I've taken an interest in the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I'm currently reading the book (I bought the whole trilogy in one book in NY, and it's like 1000 pages).  I'm only on Chapter 3 of Fellowship of the Ring (haven't had much reading time, with all the driving in NY, can't read in the car), but, it's already pretty good.  After I finish reading the book, I'm going to get the DVDs and watch them.   Anyway, I'm going to finish getting ready to go.  I have the weirdest feeling that I'm not going to get there anywhere near when I need to, mainly because my aunt is probably going to be late getting here to take me down there.  Then, I'm going to read a little bit until she gets here, then I'm going to go to school and work until 3, and then I'm going to come back here, post another brand new Random Ramble post, this time with more stuff, probably, and then I'm going to read some more.  And then I'm going to watch my favorite movie in the Back to the Future trilogy, Back to the Future II.  Wow, I've got my whole day mapped out, don't I?  For those who have been wondering about the fate of Digital Lust, it will be returning on Monday with some all new stuff for you to read.  I'm going one post per day over there, because I'm focusing most of my time on schoolwork and Blog of Bagel, of course.  But, that's quite okay.  Most of you guys don't read that blog anyway, which is why I'm taking it off of my shown blogs.  If you want to see it, you'll have to ask for the address.  But, it will remain in existance.  That's it from me for now.  Check back later on for Random Ramble, Late Night Bloggin', and maybe something else, depending on my mood at the end of the day.  Later!
