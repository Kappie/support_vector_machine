The next four days are going to be spent rejuvinating after a long, boring summer, with friends and a lot of interesting things. I am making a solumn promise here that Blog of Bagel will NOT be closed whilest I am on this school trip. I may be saying Adios, but, truth is, you'll be hearing a lot more from me this week than you will when I'm up in the New York state. I'll be posting through Audio Blogger for the next few days, so rest assured, you haven't seen the last of me. For now, at any rate. I promise that I will come back with pictures aplenty, of both me (that's right, me, I'm giving in), and everyone else that matters in my life (and 90% of those people are on yearbook staff, anyway).   There won't be any Late Night Bloggin' whilest I'm away, since I will not have access to a computer. There won't be any Absolute Boredism, because my days of being bored are over. But, there will be something called "Hidden Cellphone," where I'm going to let my cellphone go off and let anyone who says stuff be recorded onto the blog. And when I return, there's going to be camp stories and pictures, so that my blog is filled to capacity with high quality, 5.0 megapixel (thanks to my digital camera) pictures, videos, etc. Whatever I can find to put on here, it's going to happen. My Moblog is all set up for the overload of pictures that's going to come in with Yearbook Camp. I'll come back on Thursday, get set up, get things posted, and then, say goodbye again because I'm going to the New York State on Friday.   You've heard my 2002 and 2003 camp stories, and 2004 should be even funnier than the past two years, put together, even. This year's yearbook staff attendees have an incredible sense of humor, and it'll be a good time. This year, however, stories will be accompanied by pictures, since I'm blogging this year's trip.  For those of you going with me, yes, I am bringing my Xbox, in case you haven't heard, and I'll probably end up hooking it up in Courtney's room, since she's the one who really wants to play it. Courtney, I'm bringing MechAssault, and you'll love shooting things at the different mech...thingys. I'm also bringing a few other games, too, in case anyone cares. But, I forgot what they are, and its too early to get up and go to my bag, open it up, and find them. But, I am NOT bringing my GameCube (now more commonly referred to some as the Gaycube, since there's too many gay games on it). I have no games that are good for that system. It sucks.  The past month has been fun on Blogger. I have had at least two posts every single day in the past month. Now, its time for that few day break that I've needed. On Thursday Night, I'll be saying adios bloggers. I'll be going on vacation for nearly a week and a half, so I won't be blogging AT ALL, no audio or anything. I'm then going to come back for more sweet features, and I'll start blogging again on August 4th, the day after I come back, unless I get bored and blog anyway. I'm going to have sweet new features, some of which are hilarious. School's starting again, and it'll bring a new semi-weekly event, "Bloggin' in the River," where I'll talk about my high school life, and how it certainly will reach its downfall once my fruitcake brother starts going there this year! Doesn't THAT sound like fun?  So, that about wraps things up for Blog of Bagel today. I'll be back for AudioBlog of Bagel LIVE sometime today, maybe a "Hidden Cellphone" stunt. But, who knows. Have a good week folks. And I'll be back on Thursday for the "Camp Orlando 2004 Review" posts, which will be quite a few posts. Maybe 10. Or 20. Depending on how many pictures and things there are. Who cares. All I know is that this is going to be an awesome event. This is David, signing off. Adios bloggers.
