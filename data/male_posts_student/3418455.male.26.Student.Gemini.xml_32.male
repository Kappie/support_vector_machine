I can't even put a *nix system on it b/c it can't recognize a hard drive larger than 40 gigs!  USELESS.  So instead of constantly trying to fix it I let em have my old laptop...works pretty well, at least for their needs.  Of course Curtis wants a 3GHz machine but doesn't wanna have to pay for it.  It's funny, my sis has always had a puter; always one of my old ones.  Well F that crap box....i think I am going to ask curtis to take me to a shooting range and we'll take his assault rifle to it.  That should be fun.  Until next time... ~stay negativ
