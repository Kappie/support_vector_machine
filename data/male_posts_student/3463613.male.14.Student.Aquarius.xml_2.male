Other stuff going on:   Well, theres not much else going on this weekend. I'm not invited to Brendan's LAN party (see RRunner290's profile) on Friday because I went to the last one so Nick gets to go to this one. I can't wait till Halo 2 so then we can have more than two teams and more than two X-boxes. Well, whatever. Out.
