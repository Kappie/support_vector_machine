Well at least for this post.  I have been so Unreal busy everyday.  I am in class at 1:00-4:00 every day then I come home and get changed and go to work where I work till 11:00.  Then back doing homework for a few hours then I repeat the whole process.  Throw in some other craziness with some stuff in my life and you can get the picture that things have been fairly hectic.  But I did have time to go to Scott Roseman's bachelor party last saturday which was cool cuz I got to see a bunch of kids I haven't hung out with since high school.  That was the bright spot in my life along with sometimes I get to talk on the phone a little bit everyday.  Other than that if you don't talk to me this is why and sometime I will squeeze some time in there for ya.  Other than that it's off to move rooms and do homework.  Maybe I will get to go grab a quick drink.  Damn..  Je vous manque
