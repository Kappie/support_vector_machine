The Tampa Bay Devil Rays are playing some good ball right now, and they also happen to have two rookies who have a broad window to make an impression.   urlLink Dewan Brazelton  (6-4, 214, R)  Dewan is 2-0 with a 2.05 ERA and a 1.41WHIP. In his first decision versus the Marlins; Dewan took a "no-no" into the 8th. Yesterday Braz notched his second win in as many starts against the Jays. This kid is still very rough around the edges, and he's going to make some bad mistakes, but his upside is huge. Braz needs to learn how to "pitch" and not "throw". Kind of like the difference between a "boxer and a "fighter", Braz is just a fighter right now. Dewan still walks way to many hitters, and unless he gets his control issues together, he's going to get rocked one of these days or a few of these days.   I still like the kid, and I picked him up off waivers, so that's really all you need to know about how I feel about him. Braz is just so close to becoming nasty and dominant, sometimes you just gotta take a chance.   urlLink Joey Gathright  (5-10, 170, L)  The fastest man in baseball cleats is filling in for injuries to Rocco Baldelli and Tino Martinez. The 1-2 combo of Carl Crawford and Joey G. at the top of the D-Rays lineup gives this Yankee fan cold sweats, OK not really, but it does remind me of the Marlins 1-2 of Pierre and Castillo.   So far Joey G. is batting .333 in 18 at-bats with 6 Runs, 3 SB, and an OBP of .429. That BA is going to go down, and if it goes down too far Joey's going back down too. In the meantime, if you need some cheap steals, pick him up and watch for another D-Ray's speedster, BJ Upton to eventually get the call up to that big, teal gutted shopping mall they call a ballpark in Tampa.   Youâ€™ve been served.
