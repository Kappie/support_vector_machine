OUR REF: FGN/CBN/TPID/DATA/XXVOL1.2004   Hello Dear,  REF: CLAIMING A NEGLECTED FUNDS   I am the Information and Data analyst of the Treasury/Payment Investigation Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria.In the process ofcross  checking payment files inherited from previous head of this department I realized a particular payment file with series of complicated abnormal entries of a beneficiary who had made efforts towards getting the funds but to no avail; I then decided to investigate the genesis of the difficulties /hitches to the release of the said funds. I found out these:  There is NO PAYMENT STATUS on the file and on our payment computer columnas a result of mistake, I believe to have been made by the secretary who filed the particulars (DATA) i.e Bank particulars and payment reference as it was fixed in by the side column of another payment file as if the reference is not the principal benefactor of the money which effort were been made to claim it s fund.  The reference name did not appear at the foreign payment list but went and appear at the Banks domestic payment network, which is abnormal, because its fund is a foreign payment!  No fund claim certificate was issued to the reference for claim of entitled payment as constituted in our constitution for principal foreign benefactors to claim their estate benefits or contract payments without hitch.  I have decided to contact you through this medium because in my further investigation I found out that this claim is genuine with all legal backings apart from the above data irregularities and complications which made the beneficiary to gave up the claim. Therefore, I've withdrawn my submission paper for conversion of the funds to the CBN Treasury, which several payments have suffered because of irregularities since the implementation of the ICPC -Independent Corrupt Practices Commission Act.This assurance gave me courage to link you up for this particular transaction knowing it will be of mutual benefit to both of us.  Requirement: I want you to lay claim to this money as the principal benefactor, I will require from you your Bank account details ( newly opened bank account preferably for clarity)that will accommodate this total sum of USD12.5Million.I willl get the above complications corrected with your personal information as will be submitted by you.On reflecting this in the payment computer system, I will advise you on the application letter you will fax to this Departmentfor the release of the said funds.Sharing ration, 60% for me and 40% for you.I can assure you after the corrections and the application within 72hours the fund must be in your designated account.There is no single riskat all as it's quite clear to you that the Payment InvestigationDepartment of every Bank supersedes fund release at all level moreso I am the only person entitled to all payment data analysis and information.  I will oblige you with further information and please I need your privatetelephone /facsimile number for easy and confidential communication.Reply to:engrjamesali@yahoo.co.uk  ENGR. JAMES ALI.
