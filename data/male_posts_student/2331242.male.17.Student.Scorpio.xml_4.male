This blog will most likely consist of my conflict with my dear parents, which will probably make me sound like a spoiled ungrateful brat, but hey, I don't give a damn. To the reader this will probably just appear to be another typical teenage cry for help, a rant on random stuff that pisses me off, but it's  MY  rant. Eat that suckazzzz....
