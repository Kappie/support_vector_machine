Last night myself, Bryce, Dustin, Allyson, Irene, and John went to the midnight premiere of  Spiderman 2 . I found it pretty entertaining, worth the five bucks I paid even though I only slept for five hours last night.   Today I went to work, got off.  Then, I got an iPod. It is really cool. I've always considered myself of the PC side of the holy war, but this is perhaps the most beautiful technical product I've ever seen. Better yet, my dad paid for 2/3 of it and all I have to do is get a haircut.  Before the iPod, Kali called and asked me if I was wanted to go to  Fahrenheit 9/11 . Since I was only sixteen, she hung up on me which was kinda good anyway because I couldn't imagine riding in a car with them for two hours. Later, when I was reading the paper, I saw that it came to Brainerd, and she wasn't talking about St. Cloud like I thought. After I gave the Rastaman such a hard time, it turned out that it was coming after all. So me and Chris went. I just walked up and bought a ticket (so there, Kali), and Chris snuck in. I found it both disturbing and entertaining. The George Bush parts were pretty funny, but didn't really say anything I didn't already know. The Iraq parts, however, were thought-provoking. I didn't think that  Fahrenheit  would change anyone's opinion, but after seeing it I think that the images of Iraq are disturbing enough to turn someone against the war. I was appalled at the sights of burned civilians and dead children. I logically realize that Michael Moore is manipulating my emotions, yet it still makes my heart sick to see what goes on in Iraq every day.  I'm not glad that they took the coffins out. This is another example of the BACP trying to please everyone rather than expressing their true opinions. Why not, when we celebrate our independence, remember what is sacrificed for it? People should realize the cost of freedom for Iraqis and for us Americans. As conservatives so often spout, "freedom doesn't come free."  I'm going to bed. I'll get going on that stuff tomorrow or something.
