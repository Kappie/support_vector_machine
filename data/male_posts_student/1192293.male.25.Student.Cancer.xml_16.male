The record store I work at had a visit from four recording artists today to do autographs and hobnob etc.  Yep, I'm talking about  urlLink Common ,  urlLink Talib Kweli , and  urlLink Blackalicious .  I got a chance to say hi to all of them, and I got a few pictures (I'll post em when I find enough money) and a few autographs.  Needless to say, people were lined up around the store to see these guys.  They had a few people with them, to help out with crowd control and whatnot.  They also had a guy filming the whole thing.  It was pretty cool, 'cause a few of the "lyricaly well-endowed" were freestyling for the camera.  Some of them were actually really good!  This crowd was way more laid back and fun to be around than those Zug Izland chumps. I felt bad for Blackalicious, since they were added to the bill late in the game not many people knew they were there, and even fewer knew who they were.  I had heard Talib Kweli and Common before, and I like their stuff, but I was new to the Blackalicious sound.  They were such nice guys that I went and bought their album anyway.  In case you are wondering, the album is fantastic stuff.  You should buy it  urlLink right now  even if you don't like rap, that's what nice guys they are.  I wish I had the cash to go to their show.   The Award For Coolest Boss Ever Goes To...  I just wanna give huge thanks to the man who helped me get my car back from some thievin' towin' bastards.  You know who you are. Thanks a whole lot man, that is definately the coolest thing an employer has ever done for me.  Much love and mad props.
