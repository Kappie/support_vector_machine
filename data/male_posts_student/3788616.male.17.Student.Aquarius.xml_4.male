Haiz, i still can't get over my late ah Kong, after so many months, the feelings of sadness, misery and just plainly, missing him... is still there, somehow or another, everytime i see some elderly men smiling or simply just walking around, i would recall the days whereby i went out with my Ah Kong, shopping, playing board games, and just simply having nice long chats with him... i really miss him a lot... somehow or another, every thought of him would bring tears to my eyes as recollect and simply, wish that he was still alive... i will emphasise more in future...  heex... the only happy thing though about today is... i saw Kelly! haha... heex, had a brief conversation with her! haha... but anyway, i am really worried about her, considering that she just 'recovered' and yet, went for training lah! That silly girl! Kelly, take good care of yourself ok?! please... cause, i feel uneasy whenever you strain youself! Anyway, with regards to your GP and other tests! Relax lah! Don't worry! i am sure you'll do well! Have confidence in yourself! Place your trust and faith in the LORD!  ok... i need to go eat dinner liao! take care everyone! keep smiling! :p
