It's a beautiful little city and we parked on a city street and walked to the beach. The water was warm! The waves were terrific... big, salty and fun.    We swamfor an hour... then we laid on the beach for an hour... swam for an hour... sat on the beach for an hour. Once we finished that, we went to a Mexican bar in the city and had drinks and free burritos (happy hour). Ick, the margaritas weren't as good as I was hoping. We ate chips with really spicey salsa (I was longing for some guacamole).    We headed to Long Beach where Aaron's friend (who got us all those free tickets) lives. Her name is Frances, she lives in a beautiful apartment. We went to a nice Chinese Wokery, ate lots of white-people food (they didn't have any dim sum or good vegetarian dishes). We took some nice pictures and headed home.    We hung out for awhile here, they all drank, I fell asleep after losing a game of pool around midnight.     urlLink     Huntington Beach    urlLink     Eating Mexican    urlLink     Mom  I after eating Chinese Food     Today we're going to the Ontario mall and shopping for a bit.
