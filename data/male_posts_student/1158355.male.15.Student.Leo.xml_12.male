I don't think she likes me... than again she said she wasn't social and always rejects people when they go for the high five or a hug. I got a few high fives but never any hugs. Then there's this girl named Amanda in 10th grade who got hugged by Chris Barone on the way off the bus. She flipped out right in front of the bus driver saying "You freakin asshole, don't fucking do that again!" and it occured to me... who the hell uses freakin and fucking in the same sentence? I slapped Paul alot today, I don't know why. I got my report card, 3.64... yeeeaaa bitch. Only thing is I got an incomplete in Band because Santa Keyes forgot to put my damn grade in the book! He looks like Santa yet he's Jewish? WTF? Hope there's no school tomorrow! GENERALS IS OUT TOMORROW!!!
