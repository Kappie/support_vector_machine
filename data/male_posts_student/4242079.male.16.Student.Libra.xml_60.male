It's always been the hardest button to push. Crystal? Where have you gone? You know I still want you around in some capacity. Jason...Jason my good friend, I saw you getting gas the other night, but I was too tired and too scared to pull into the parking lot to say hello. Courtney...ah Courtney, my short little friend, and Chelz, where the hell are ya? All of you, I wish things were like they were, I wish things could be the same.   and maybe it's all my fault, and to each of you, my sincere apologies
