These small fish can move faster in water by spreading their fins and lifting their tails out of the water. In this way, they slide swiftly in water.  THE HERON  The heron displays great skill in catching fish. It stands up spreading its wings in an umbrella shape above its head. This produces a shadow and prevents reflections from the surface of the water. Now, the heron can clearly see its prey under the surface of the water. The wings of the bird form a circular shadow on the water's surface, and it always fishes inside this circle.
