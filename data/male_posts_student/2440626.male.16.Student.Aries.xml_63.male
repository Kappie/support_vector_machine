We had seats in the second row!  The actors were great and the singing and the sets and the costumes...all wonderful.  Anyway, I better go.  Sorry to cut things short, but I have somethings to do and I want to get to sleep earlier tonight.  I'll be at the fair tomorrow from like 11:30 am to 4 pm.  Stop out and visit!  I'll be there Monday night too, from 6 pm and 11 pm?  I think so.  Summer's Best 2 Weeks starts Monday morning.  I am gonna be so drained for the next 2 weeks.  Well,   I am off.   Have a good night and a pleasant tomorrow.
