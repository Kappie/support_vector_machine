Anyway I heated up some hot water and started to make some of those japanese-big-bowl-cup-of-noodles. "Nong Shim's Bowl Noodle Soup: Picante flavor" was the label... I don't know what happened. Maybe when they translated Hot from english to spanish to forgein asian, and then to english it turned from Hot to Hot with some crap on top and some fake vegatables. Now if you think I am going overboard with this... You are wrong. The Onion was a small piece of plastic with purple lines. Now I have  headache and my stomach feels woozy. Wait... I just read the label, this piece of crap is a product of Korea. Damn Koreans.
