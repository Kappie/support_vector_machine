We went back to the Community Park trails, but ended up going every into little secluded half-covered in high grass paths. Thanks to our fearless leader, Bartol. Somehow we ended up in a bunch of swamps so I come up with the idea to go to the abandoned train station. Fun fun. On our way over we saw a bunch of pipes. Which made for some more fun. Hehe. After that we saw these big things with holes in them so we climbed through them. You'd swear we're still in pre-school. Then at the train station we had some more fun times. Best time at cross country this year. After that I layed around until like 12:50 when I realized I had bowling. Went there. Good time too. Did pretty bad though. Haha, Travis. ROB ZOMBIE. Charley sucks. I bet only one person knows what I'm talking about and everyone else thinks I am insane. Maybe. ...  ... Then after bowling (funny stuff there too right Ash), we walked over to Valley High because someone needed ice cream. After crossing the street and almost getting killed, we walked to the basketball courts to find Neil with a weedwhacker. Good idea though. After that I go to play volleyball. A little hard though when there's a huge clothesline right in the middle of the net. Fun nonetheless. Even though I owned in volleyball. After hanging around wasting away and hearing complaining the entire time we play more volleyball and I own it up again. Then somehow I get coaxed into playing *gasp* soccer for the first time in like 3 years. And I get smoked right in the shin. I should've seen it coming. And it's not funny. So yeah today was cool. I bet you're all bored reading this. Well tough. Get over it.
