Its not even funny. There are probably less than 15 7th graders at Franklin that I have been friends with for at least 60 percent of the year. And of those people, Im probably only going to stay in touch with about 5 of them. I think I should be much more upset about changing schools then I am. In fact, Im happy about leaving. Mikes going to get recruited soon. Im definitly going to keep hanging out with Ben and Connor. And I dont know who else Im going to stay in touch with. Probably Kelsey. And probably a few people from in 8th and from Union. Lets hope I make some cool friends at Hun. Thats it. Peace
