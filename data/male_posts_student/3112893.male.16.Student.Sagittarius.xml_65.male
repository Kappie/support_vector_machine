Just a warning to everyone, ya know, just to let everyone know before they read, this was mostly an uneventful day with. So, today starts off like every other day. I wake up, I go to the computer, I walk around, I get tired quickly from too little sleep, I go back to sleep, I wake up again, I look in the mirror, do my daily hygiene, go back to the computer, do some stuff on it including learn C, pick up the guitar, play a little, listen to some music on the stereo, pack up the house some more. Ya know, all the same stuff I've been talking about since I've gotten to Boston. To be honest, it completely lame. I've been looking for the cheapest PC that I can find that I will be able to keep for a couple years for programming applications and the like. So far I've come to the conclusion that Compaq is my best option, but I'll keep up the search and look for an even better price than 950 bucks for the system I configured.  I  also  went out to coffee with my dad to meet with someone. His name is Ali, but this is a different one from the one I've been talking about before. They talked about stuff and I listened and occasionally threw some thought in there. The conversation somehow managed to move from science education to world affairs and we started talking about the chinese and indian economies and outsourcing and the like and I think I've realized what's been bugging me so much about China. As much as I want to kill the whole fucking place, I can't because they have that stupid nuke. Anyway, I don't  really  want to kill them all, I just want them to be powerless... and even that I don't  really  want. Whatever, that doesn't matter. In my ever-lasting quest to find out more about me and what makes me work and get mad or sad or upset or happy or whatever about certain things, I decided to think about what was really making me so upset about China and I came to the following conclusion.  I feel uncomfortable with China's growth because it would not be possible without the sheer number of people that they have populating their nation. It's like 1.5 BILLION vs 350 million, it's not exactly the same ball game. Anyway, the chinese government doesn't believe in human rights it seems so whenever they need people to work, they force them to and don't give them all the little niceties such as a bathroom break or a decent wage. And if there's a riot, they just kill them all because they know they have more people to do their stupid labor work. On the other hand, you have a nation like US who believes in human rights (at least for themselves) and supports a healthy work environment and better productivity per capita, but might not be able to compete just because of sheer mass of China. What makes the whole situation worse is that I feel like China is just using its complete disrespect for the human condition to further its growth. It just bothers me. I really wish that I was like some kind of ultra-powerful dictator who could just assassinate the whole chinese government and put my own nice one in. The world be a better place, man. Vote Feanor for president.  Ok, so after that little discussion/meeting thing, my dad and I came home and ate dinner. We didn't eat anything much because both of us were too tired to cook so we just pulled out some of those microwave dinner things from the freezer, heated those up, and ate those. While I was eating, I looked up some more computers that reinforced my thoughts about the compaq and the Doom III beta image that I've been trying to send my cousin, Peter, finally finished after two days. I hate his stupid 28.8k. Anyway, I think that just about covers it because I had just finished my little dish thing when I started this and... yeah. That covers it alright.  That is all. -- Feanor
