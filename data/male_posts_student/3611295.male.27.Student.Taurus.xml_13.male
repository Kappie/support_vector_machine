Well it was answering machines all morning as edgar and gerrit got flaked on again. Well they missed out. A group of venomous man eating sharks that spit bees attacked carrie! Who should come to the rescue but edgar jurado. As edgar grappled and ripped his way through many a shark, gerrit quicky used his chemical knowledge and combined gum, saltwater, and beer ala macgyver to creat a smokescreen and get him outta there. The ocean was now clear again.  OK, that may or may not happened, but the machines have gotta stop! Danny is off the hook due to school responsibilites which he forgot to mention the day before. Al and joe need to not commit to something then flake out. Although it is expected, how late do you guys have to stay up! Al and Joe up late.......Hmmmmmmmmm I wonder......  G-Unit
