Unfortunately for their international popularity, they sing exclusively in German.  For the one or two of you who are not familiar with the Blumfeld  oeuvre , it would be helpful perhaps to imagine  urlLink Christie Front Drive , but in German.  But the Blumfeld story is not a happy one.  It is depressing and irksome.  The simple fact is that it remains a mystery how the same band that released  Ich-Maschine  and the truly indispensible  urlLink  L'Etat Et Moi   could possibly be responsible for the total piece of crap that is  Testament Der Angst  with only one other album intervening.  To date Blumfeld's one true classic album is the aforementioned  L'Etat et moi  (Big Cat 1994).  It moves from peak to peak.  The shimmering album-opener "Draussen auf Kaution" ("Out on bail") would later be recalled, albeit speeded-up and slopped-out, in the entire recorded output of . . .And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead.  From there we get more abstract, postpunk, Fugazoid tunage like "Jet Set", "Eine eigene Geschichte" ("A True Story"), and "Verstärker" ("Amplifier").  The antecedents to their sound are clearly to be found in Fugazi, Husker Du, Swervedriver, or similar groups.  Passing over the simply average  Old Nobody  (in retrospect the beginning of the end), we arrive at 2001's  Testament der Angst  ("Testament of Fear").   Testament  exists in an entirely separate universe from Blumfeld's first two albums.  It is truly a shock to listen to after having been exposed to their prior output.  It is schmaltz.  It is overproduced, and parts of it drip with the kind of easy-listening, smug, "groovy" sax solos that got Steve Winwood assigned to political reeducation.  At one point during "Anders als Glücklich" ("Other than happy") lead singer Jochen Distelmeyer even employs the device of tossing off an aside to his backup singers.  One would hope this sort of exchange is done in homage to Scritti Politti rather than Dean Martin, but the effect is the same.  It is a bad album.  It deserves to be included on a canonical list of bad albums by once-great bands.  This is not rare, and it is usually not a tragedy.  Hey Mercedes'  Everynight Fire Works  is also, in its own way, total shit.  However, it is total shit because it is clear that the band have run out of ideas, and that their melodic instincts have given way to the rote reproduction of ideas which have proven themselves to be effective.  It is composition on autopilot.  This is also the reason  Harmacy  is a bad album.  More generally, it is the reason all ska is artistically bankrupt.  That could not be further from the case with Blumfeld.  Not only does every last overproduced piece of schmaltz on the album, buried under enervated musicianship, phoned-in (if ultracompetent) performances, and the kind of vocal mugging practiced by ersatz Sinatras the world over, feature consistently great songwriting reminiscent of the band at their prime, but it's clear that head songwriter Distelmeyer is still listening, and still drawing in influences and ideas.  He's also still thinking - typically you'd expect that when a band as political as Blumfeld is goes pop-rock, they'd trade in the leftism for a politically quietistic focus on girls and heartbreak, but no, these songs are all just as explicit in their political commitment as their old ones.  Nowhere is this more clear than on the title track.  The song is clearly an anomaly on the album.  First of all, the production heavily forefronts distorted bass, and an organ carries the rudimentary tune.  What the music suggests to me is that someone in the band has more than a passing familiarity with  urlLink Big Black , Happy Go Licky, and contemporary synth-/ dracula-core acts like maybe Song of Zarathustra, Shortwave Channel, or  urlLink Milemarker .  Of course, we're still listening through that aggravating Quincy Jones production, so it's like getting a glimpse of our nursing-home listening habits:  It's 2060, and they've figured out a way to play the Locust in a way that doesn't put us over-eighties off our meds.  To say nothing of the quality of the track (it sucks, but the song is great - someone should play a version with some freaking  balls ) it indicates that the band continues to listen to and receive ideas from loud North American underground music, which is the best kind of North American underground music in North America.  This is why the fact that  Testament  is a bad album is so unfortunate.  This is not a band that's just up and gone soft.  This is a band that for some reason or another has made a conscious decision to play the kind of crapola that I can only assume gets them airplay in Germany, but they just can't help themselves - Song of Zarathustra has gotten to them, and they want to incorporate some of those elements, no matter how debased they have to make it.  PS -  I learned while researching this little rant that Blumfeld just released a new album,  Jenseits von Jedem , last month.  Of course the only reviews of it I found are on   urlLink Amazon.de , and are therefore even more slavishly positive than the ones in Rolling Stone.  So I may be writing back in a few months with a postmortem on that one there.
