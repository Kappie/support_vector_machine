Today is a day in which we should all reflect on the lives of the soldiers who have died defending this country. They have given their blood to protect the lives and rights of others not just in their country, but around the world. On June 6th, 2004, it will be 60 years to the day since the Allies invaded Normandy, France on a day that we know as 'D-Day'. It was a battle that the Allies had desperately needed to turn the tide of the war. Today, we are facing a new enemy. Only this time it is hidden from us and we sometimes aren't exactly sure what we are fighting. One might say we are fighting terrorism, other ignorant people might say we are fighting Afghanistan or Iraq. Bush's so-called 'fight against terrorists' is simply impossible. You can't wipe terrorism from the face of the planet.  IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN!  The reason why we are fighting other peoples' war is to liberate them from their strict religious law imposing governments and expose them to democracy. Today's war is a different kind of war. During World War II, our soldiers deaths' meant something. Unfortunatly today, coalition soldiers overseas have no idea what they are doing there in the first place.
