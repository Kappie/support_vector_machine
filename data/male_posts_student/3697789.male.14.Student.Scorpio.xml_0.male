Cheese grows better with time. Or was that wine?  Hmm. Anyway, this is my first blog anywhere anytime! My sister, however, appears to be addicted to blogging. Its the cheese withdrawal, I tell you.  Soooo. I'll start first with some background, then every blog AFTER this will be detailing REAL EVENTS! GWEEEE!!  I'm a 11 year old kid living in singapore. I like to think that I'm cultured, so I play the piano and am now...grade five? I think?  Anyways, I actually don't play that much. I have weekly lessons of one hour, but that's about all I play. And what's amusing is that after two weeks of holiday, I came back and my playing still hadn't changed. :P  My teacher didn't make the connection that if I don't play for two weeks and I'm still the same, that means I don't practice at all! Lucky me.  I like playing the piano, but it's quite hard to remember, sometimes.  Also, I'm a geek. I spend most of my time reading Final Fantasy 7/8/9/10 but mostly FF7 fanfics, and I enjoy lots of animes too! Including Ranma 1/2, Neon Genesis Evangelion, DBZ...  For those of you who don't know, fanfiction is when you really like a TV show or a cartoon or game or whatever. As a result, you want to write stories about that TV show/game/whatever. The biggest archives can be found at www.fanfiction.net and www.mediaminer.org.  I think Shinji/Rei is the best pairing ever.  As might be expected, I also write (quite immature and bad)fanfictions. They can be found at www.fanfiction.net/~Silverdancer. Please READ AND REVIEW!!  All right, now that my rant is over, I can get on with the more important details.  Singapore uses the British education system, so we have 6 years of primary school, 4 years secondary, 2 years Junior college and then 4 years University.  Right now I'm in my last year of primary school. lucky meeee~~!!  I'm feeling kinda hyper -_-;;  *bounce bounce*
