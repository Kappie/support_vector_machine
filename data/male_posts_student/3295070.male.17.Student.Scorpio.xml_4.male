Here I am sitting in front of my computer doing absolutely nothing as usual, figured this might be a way to get down my thoughts in an organised way, AND cut back on the incredible boredom that i suffer from time to time. This being my first blog/diary/anything along those lines, It's gonna be pretty rusty at first, but I hope it gets better quickly. My apologies in advance. hehehe       Now for the juicy bits . . . . how about I start off with an introduction for all the people who (hopefully) read this, and DONT know me? well I'm Steve . . . and im a bit of an arogant guy, I like to think of myself as a pretty inteligent person, but sometimes i even doubt that myself. I ride a unicycle, I play many musical instruments (Tuba, trombone, bass guitar, etc...) or should i say I used to play many musical instruments, and im pretty good with electronics. I dont really do much of anything these days though, I guess thats why im such a morose guy, but I'm ok with it right now. I dont have a job, nor have I in almost a year . . . i feal that i needed some time to sort my personal issues out . . . and now that theyre still pretty fucked up, i think im ready for another job, but actually finding one after doing next to nothing for quite a while is a big task in itself . . .       I guess that's a fair size for a post considering I havent written anything about myself . . . ever, so untill next time . . .  -adios
