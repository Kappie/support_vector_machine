Man, that was a long sentence. Some people feel that they control every single portion of their lives, while others think that no matter what they do, things were meant to occur in a particular fashion.   Well I'm here to say that I think both are possible, and may in fact work simultaneously. Is it not conceivable that our lives are predetermined in such a way that we are unable to understand, such that while we live our lives making our own decisions, those decisions were already predetermined, no matter how deeply we consider our actions? I think there's a common misconception that in order for us to have free will, we have to defeat or fool the concept of predetermination. "Well, I'm supposed to do that, so I'm going to do this instead!"  I don't think it's that simple. Likewise, we can't just stand around and wait for our lives to happen as if they were scripted. Even if there is a greater plan, be it divine, feline...wait... ....right, even if there is a greater plan, we have to act on our own will.  Now, we could live our lives according to any number of doctrines, as many people do when they find meaning through religion and spirituality. But even people who live by a spiritual code and allow the will of a god or spirits to guide them, at the end of the day, they still have to decide if they want their sandwich on white or wheat. Therefore, I posit that both free will and fate can act upon our lives and decisions at any time, and that we'll probably never know the truth of the matter until we reach the end of our personal tunnels, wherever they may lead.  Okay, I'm done on this for the moment. Feel free to post comments if you so desire, and I wish you all a wonderful next 45 minutes of your lives, in all of its predetermined freedom. >;)~
