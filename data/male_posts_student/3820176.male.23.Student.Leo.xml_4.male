And I looked into his eyes; they were blue like mine, I recognized    the hollow sunken feeling like some work of art they painted    to hang upon the wall as we gathered round to praise the honesty    of one man's lonely mistery.      And every heart that ever broke    one man's dreams a heavy load that died    from an overdose of on the road sits all alone.        And I gave the man some money    and wished him well, as my eyes fell to his feet    the bottom of a body, wrapped up inside such ragged clothes    that i felt like a millionaire with little more, but rich so rich in love    and no one gives a damn for him     And I hope that he finds Jesus or a bed tonight, or another drink    I'd take him home but you see now I don't live alone    and even if I did, some other reason would make me think    of the places that I must go.        And maybe if he got a shave and washed the blood off of his face    and changed his suit,    he'd be some use to this country, this prosperity    but he's bleeding in his soul;   they haven't found a cure for that, you see,    except for maybe burgundy.     And every heart that ever broke  one man's dreams a heavy load that died  from an overdose of on the road sits all alone.
