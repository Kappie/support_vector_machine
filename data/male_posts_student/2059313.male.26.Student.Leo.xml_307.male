I also withnessed so many failed relationships or unhealthy relationships or relationships that took my friends away from me that I didn't want to get involved in that.  I think I've had more "second hand" pain from relationships that most people have had first hand.  It's kind of like second hand smoke... you're not smoking but you're still reaping the unhealthy consequences.  With relationships, you get to see all the aftermath of the heart-ache, bad-blood, break-ups, fights, etc, without any of the good stuff.  I hate seeing people hurting from something someone else has done.  It's even worse when it's something I've done.  I feel like atlas some days being able to bear the weight of the world on my shoulders, and some days I feel like I'm nothing but this thin clay shell that will break if the slightest pressure is applied to it.  Sometimes I can't take the pressure and just want to leave everything alone and not watch, because I can't bear the pain of seeing someone hurting.  And other times I feel like there's never enough I can do, because I want to help bear someone's pain and hurting.  I feel so very selfish.
