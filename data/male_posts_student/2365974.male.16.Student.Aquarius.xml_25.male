     
      insanity  madness  the carnage a madman feels. all the hate in the world piling up. morethan what the heart could muster.  the craving.  the longing for blood to be spilled. for make rasputin tremble before the manic tortures he's never encountered before even after death.  death in the darkest way  death in the most wicked way  you who has broken the balance  you who has changed the push to a shove, shall feel what the ninth level of hell is all about. shall experience of torturing beyond death's bounderies.  an eternity of torment  an eternity of pain and suffering  as your maker rips the flesh of your mortal body  as he stips whatever's left on your spirit  you will bleed a river of blood  and the halls of heaven and hell will echo your screems  you will suffer.
