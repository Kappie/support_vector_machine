The two of them together basically went along the lines that some thing's dont exist untill you give them a name. The next day I had a lecture on adversiting, and i was wondering why there hadn't been as many "evil corperations" or so much advertising untill recently. And then it hiot me this is when western civilisation has been labeled capitalist. As soon as we knew what we were we worked on being the best at that as we could. Same with advertising.   Anyways im probably wrong, after all i do go to UWS, not USYD, so nyeh
