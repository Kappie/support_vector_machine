Well, that's all my work for the day, those tests are damn hard, and ot show how bad they were, and the torture I went throught the past 2 days, here is another taster: 'Why might Flaxtons consider the out of town site to be an improvement on its existing town centre location' (10 marks) and 'How might Paul and Kate try to deal with the changes in the break even indicated' (12 marks) THERE WERE LOADS OF THEM. Arghhh, the pain, the pain.... I curse the day I chose business studies as one of my options.  Anyway, in other matters, I got my hair cut this morning. 'Bout time, it was getting long. Now it it nice and short, and hopefully I can put off getting it cut again untill after the exams, but probably shortly after we break up from school. £9 that cost me! £9! What a waste... Even though my parents will probably pay for it, but still. £9! I should learn to cut my own hair, save me a bit of money.  Also, started reading 'Catch-22' last night, and got through about 3 chapters (about 35 pages). Ok, I'm a slow reader. It seems ok, not great. It'll probably get better though. It better do. I would have liked to get a good DiscWorld book out. Now, they are very good. If you haven't read them, I definatly reccomend them. If you like fantasy. A lot. If you like a slushy romance or crappy crime book, then don't bother.   And back to business studies. Owwww! Why is it so hard and boring? It's horrible, learning facts about the government, economy, balance sheets urgh, the list goes on. And Geograhy! That's possible just as bad. And don't get me started on English...   This is just turning into waffle/rant so I'll stop now. Bye my good fans! And keep reading, more to follow shortly.   Playing: Nothing at the moment. Windows Media Player, does that count? No? Nothing it is then.  Listening To: An assortment of my favourite music. Currently, 'The Chicken Song' - Spitting Image  Watching: Nothing again  Annoyed With: Business Studies!!!!!! Grrrr...  Confused About: Location factors of businesses  Mood: Slightly annoyed
