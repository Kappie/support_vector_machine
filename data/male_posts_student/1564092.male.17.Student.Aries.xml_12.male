The meeting was boring and it really went down hill after someone made a comment about a shovel and the room started laughing about it, well, except me of coarse because I know nothing about gardening, nor do I want to really, nor did I find the elementary joke funny, but when I asked him if there was a coffee shop anywhere around and he stated 'yes' I then had something to look forward to after an hour conversation about roses. We went to a little coffee shop called  Joshua Cup Coffee  and it was a spiffy little place but Mr. Hunt was bouncing off the walls and I honestly didn't want to be seen with him in public because of it and also because I had made eye contact with this hot girl that was sipping on a cup of joe on the couch while we walked in. I ordered an espresso drink called a Josh Java and it was  really  good except I didn't have the chance to put anything in it, sugar or milk, because I wanted to run out the door when the guy handed me my snazzy little brown coffee cup. You can read about the mission statement and what the coffee shop is all about  urlLink here  and see why it is such a cool place. I want to buy one of their t-shirts and support a good cause. I am tired. I want to post about my many adventures that I have taken part in these past two days but I am about to fall over. The coffee is wearing off and I'm pretty bloody exhausted. But I'm still in a really good mood if you can believe it. I would get up and do something right now if I could. This was a lame excuse for a post was it not? lol
