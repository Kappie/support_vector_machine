Ok now that i got that out of the way, i want to admit to something. For the past couple of weeks i have seriously been thinking about doing coke. I know I lead a small anti-drug campaign and all that stuff, but i always wanted to see what it was like, what everyone was getting so excited about. But tonight I will tell you that I will NEVER EVER do it, and im glad I NEVER did it. For the high that you get is totally not worth the bullshit in the end. Im not going into details so dont even ask me, but I will tell you that one of my friends needs to produce $150 by the end of tonight or else he is going to get his ass kicked. And believe me, the people that are going to be doing the beating are quite big and scary... people who you definitly dont want to fuck with.  GOD that is so scary, the fact that people will go to your house to kick the shit out of you becuase you did something you shouldnt be doing in the first place I hope thats a lesson that goes to everyone Darin
