I'm hoping that by dallying here, I can waste time and not study for my APs. It appears to be working. I simply cannot believe that we have already arrived at the end point of my Junior Year. An entire year's worth of labor will now be put to the test, to find whether I have the mettle to back up my boasts and submit these tests to my will. Actually there is an exception to that statement - World History. I've minimally studied for it, but I did not take the class. But I have failed and fallen in so many other areas this year - I am left with only one chance at redemption, even if in only my own eyes.   Hmm, my eyes. I like the phrase, because its fitting to my particular mood. I've drifted into one of my more jaded, somewhat disappointed, ambivalent states. Did you know that movies and TV are evil? They allow you to believe incredible fantasy and impossibility to be just that, possible. They foster the superhero, everything will turn all right in the end mentality. But beyond that, they allow total immersation and observation without interaction! It describes me right now. I'm constantly wallowing between the extremes of "I am the only one who actually exists" to "Everyone but me exists." It's easy to take that the wrong, 'look-at-me-I'm-a-lost-goth-girl-who-is-in-an-identity-crisis' sort of meaning out of that. But I don't feel bad, or lost, or any less me. I just don't quite realize my own effect on other people and on reality itself - I feel like the cameraman in the movies, following and watching - not more than that. I'm not depressed, just insular I suppose. A mere analysis of how I feel currently, certain to rebound to hubris and narcissism in good time. Perhaps thats why I find it hilarious that I can be considered a good judge of character and a decent person.   Actually, that last part has nothing to do with that. I am a decent person in most senses of the word. I feel confident in many of my abilities, and totally inadequate in those I consider important only because I fail at them, but such is the same in others.  I just don't feel decent. I can't bring myself to consider myself a good person - at best a coldly indifferent one. I feel constantly wracked with the need for vengence for something that really hasn't been committed against me - essentially, I'm always an angry, poor sport. Sometimes I'm genuinely frightened by my wreckless and selfish misanthropy, other times I blow it off by dismissing it as mere teenage agnst and what-not. But every time I do that I remember the people I have been a dick too, much to my own pleasure, the people who I have acted against and hurt. I become flooded with guilt, but more pertinently, a small thrill - as if I'm willing myself to want to enjoy it all. I've been totally corrupted by cartoons and comic books - I almost want to be a supervillain. Luckily, such delusions are merely that - fantasy. But unluckily, I may be a shining example of a proto-psychopath with the possibility of a full blown neurosis. You see, pyschopaths  aren't   insane. Thats a popular misconception. Pyschopaths are "are not disoriented or out of touch with reality, nor do they experience the delusions, hallucinations, or intense subjective distress that characterize most other mental disorders. Unlike psychotic individuals, psychopaths are rational and aware of what they are doing and why. Their behavior is the result of choice, freely exercised.  Psychopaths are guided by such a different thought process than non-psychopathic humans, we tend to find their behavior inexplicable. But they're actually much easier to predict than the rest of us once you understand them. Psychopaths follow much stricter behavior patterns than the rest of us because they are unfettered by conscience, living solely for their own aggrandizement. None of his victims means anything to the psychopath. He recognizes other people only as means to obtain what he desires. Not only does he feel no guilt for destroying their lives, he doesn't grasp what they feel. The truly hard-core psychopath doesn't quite comprehend emotions like love or hate or fear, because he has never experienced them directly." to steal from the Columbine article I previously linked to. Look how the leader, Harris, is described:   "He is disgusted with the morons around him. These are not the rantings of an angry young man, picked on by jocks until he's not going to take it anymore. These are the rantings of someone with a messianic-grade superiority complex, out to punish the entire human race for its appalling inferiority. It may look like hate, but "It's more about demeaning other people," Harris claimed to lie to protect himself, but that appears to be something of a lie as well. He lied for pleasure, Fuselier says. "Duping delight"?psychologist Paul Ekman's term?represents a key characteristic of the psychopathic profile. Harris married his deceitfulness with a total lack of remorse or empathy?another distinctive quality of the psychopath. Fuselier was finally convinced of his diagnosis when he read Harris' response to being punished after being caught breaking into a van. Klebold and Harris had avoided prosecution for the robbery by participating in a "diversion program" that involved counseling and community service. Both killers feigned regret to obtain an early release, but Harris had relished the opportunity to perform. He wrote an ingratiating letter to his victim offering empathy, rather than just apologies. Fuselier remembers that it was packed with statements like Jeez, I understand now how you feel and I understand what this did to you. "But he wrote that strictly for effect," Fuselier said. "That was complete manipulation. Harris' pattern of grandiosity, glibness, contempt, lack of empathy, and superiority read like the bullet points on Hare's Psychopathy Checklist and convinced Fuselier and the other leading psychiatrists close to the case that Harris was a psychopath.  "  Interesting stuff - interesting enough for me to bring it back up. Does it apply to me? I don't know. I'm not homicidal, but the manipulation, arrogance, lack of empathy can certainly be found within me. Interesting enough for me to mull on this. Perhaps I should go back into my studies in self-hypnosis to deal with this matter. I'm probably just jealous and feeling the pangs of my romantic and possibly sexual virginity harder than ever right now. Whatever. Now I have to go worry about APs and college. Oy vey. But not before I complete my new additions   Boring, yet Important   Once I again, I only have the will to post news lite - but it's important none-the-less! Twenty-five baby, twenty-five big ones. No one has turned twenty five, but the European Union is now comprised of twenty five members. Ten new nations, mostly Eastern European, have been added to the previously fifteen country bloc in emotional, patriotic orgasms throughout all of Europe. The sheer brilliance in choosing May Day - the international worker's day cannot be understated, if only for its kitchy value. On what was traditionally a day of forced jovialness, endless military parades, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, roughly seventy-five million people have entered one of the most boringly exciting if not particuarly useful political organizations to exist. For a general description, go  urlLink here. This is the largest expansion in the European Union's history - it is now comprised of 455 million people, and has had its territory increased by twenty-five percent - yet its gross domestic product grew by just five percent. Therein lies the difficulty ahead for the Union. The true importance lies not in the size of the increase, but the fact that eight of the ten new members were formally communist - three of them actually previously were incoroporated in the Soviet Union - and in the wealth disparity between the old and new.  The outlook is not entirely rosy - average GDP per head in the ten new countries is only 46% of the previous Euro average - Latvia, the poorest new member, has a GDP per head of only 36%. Forecasts by the Economist Intelligence Unit say it will take Poland 59 years to catch up with the European average. Headaches abound when confronted by this in the Union Center of Brussels. But that is not all. The European Union itself is undergoing a phase of exceptional unpopularity. Polls have shown that member country support for the Union has fallen sharply below 50%. Spanish and Greek voters have thrown out their old goverments; Germany and France have suffered humiliating setbacks in regional elections. Blair is under constant flack now in Britain, as is Berscoullini in Italy. Any news eminating from Brussels is vitorolically derided. Brussels itself is a seat of bitter controversey - the drafting the constitution is in a near lockdown, big and small countries are at lodgerheads of how to decide voting weights, and the former Franco-German driving engine of Europe is now widely resented. The EU institutions, such as the executive European Commision and the legislative European Council and the European Parliament are ill-prepared for the influx of so many countries, people, and languanges.  Poor economic growth can be cited as the major factor for this discontent. The average growth in Germany, France, and Italy has averaged at a mere 1.6%. Unemployment remains high: 9.3% in Germany, 9.4% in France, 11.2% in Spain. Many countries that pay heavily into the EU, such as Germany and the Netherlands, worry they will now have to give more, while those who currently benefit the most, such as Spain and Portugal, fear their cash will now be siphoned eastward. But an even more sensitive issue is prevalent - migration. Newspapers across the EU have run terrified nativist propaganda about being swamped by immigrants from East and Central Europe. It is a sign of the times that most of the EU15 have taken advantage of transitional rules to erect temporary barriers to the free movements of people from the ten new countries - even though in the long run they need more immigrants, not less.   In fact, the actions of the current member countries of the EU can be put to blame for the less than stellar economic revival in Europe. The three largest euro-area economies - Germany, France, Italy - all only play lipservice to the need for change. Despite Frances announces reforms in health care finance and new tax cuts, and Germany's watered down Agenda 2010 for reforms to pensions, welfare benefits, and labor markets, reform has been entirely too modest. Yet even those have been met by voter resistance, and there appears to be hope for change in the climate. Thanks in part to the European Central Bank's tight monetary policy, the fiscal-policy restictions of the stability pact, and their own failure to implement reforms the biggest European economies are stuck in sluggish growth and in the midst of a viscious cycle - slow growth means high unemployment, which means little support for reform, which means slower growth. But the ten new countries could actually help in that regard. They are growing faster than the current members - quite possible for them to be the jumpstart Europe needs. Having lived under a central planned economy, many of them are, on the whole, more liberal economically. There is the risk that membership could force more regulation, but as it stands, there is a general leaning in favor of low taxes, smaller welfare systems, and more competition. It is in the economy that the EU needs to show more ambition, instead of granstanding in the field of foreign affairs. Now that the EU is comprised of both Rumsfeld's "Old" and "New" Europe, polarization is an increasing possibility. Foreign and Security policy set up with a rivalry to the United States in mind a successful doctrine does not make. Where it should focus is in its most successful sphere - expanding the club, especially Turkey.  Its hard to imagine that what is now the European Union started as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 with only six members - Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxemborg - with a primary emphasis on Franco-German reconciliation. Now is the time of trial for the EU. It has not proved itself as a competing model to the USA to the rest of the world, nor has it proved itself as an effective rival to the rest of the world as the USA. It should be noted that the USA and the EU are not and shoul not be competin, but this is merely from a global viewpoint. Perhaps soon the EU can be taken seriously.  Much thanks goes to the Economist where I liberally lifted most of this information/sentences. God Bless the Economist.   Emma's Good News Journal   - Amid the Chaos of the Middle East, the Tunisian island of Jerba is an oasis of calm, where some 1,000 jews live peacefully among 70,000 Muslims. Jerban Jews began arriving in 586 BC; in the centuries since, they have remained embedded in the islands everyday life. Two years ago, when an al Qaeda suicide bomber killed 15 people in the historic Ghriba synagogue, Muslims joined Jews in a defiant march of solidarity. "Sometimes we talk about the situation between the Israelis and the Arabs," said jeweler Hai Haddad, "but we don't let it affect us here. To find a community like this, when things are so difficult in the Middle East, it means things are not impossible.  -This one is here because it made me laugh. The FCC  has fined a Miami radio station $4,000 for broadcasting a crank telephone call to Fidel Castro. Two WXDJ-FM disc jockeys got the Cuban leader on the line in June by claiming to be aides to Venezueland President Hugo Chavez. Using a recording of Chavez, they fooled Castro into exchanging pleasantries, then broke in and called him a murderer. "You fell for it," they said. Castro replied "I haven't said [expletive]. Go to [expletive]," then hung up. The Federal Communications Commision said broadcasting the exchange violated a rule against putting someone on the air without permission. The station has a month to pay up or appeal.   -Israeli scientists who have built the world's smallest medical computer - so small that a million million of them would fit in a drop of water - have "diagnosed" prostate cancer and released a drug to kill cancer cells, they announce today. So far, the technology has only worked in a test tube. But it could be another step towards the dream of nanotechnological medical machines, measured in millionths of a millimetre, that could operate inside a living human, identify the first signs of a developing disease, and deliver the right treatment - all before any symptoms appear.

The San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network, which successfully pressured Citigroup Inc. (C.N: Quote, Profile, Research) to tighten its own standards, had called on the banks to adopt by April 22, which was Earth Day, standards that meet or exceed Citigroup's. The group is expected on Thursday to update its campaign's status. Read more  urlLink here .  Thats all for today. Where in the hell did I get the energy to put all this drivel up.
