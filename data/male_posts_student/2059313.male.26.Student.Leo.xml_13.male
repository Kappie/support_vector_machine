Guys who have it all together, and never seem to cry, ball like a baby because of love.  Someone who is in the depths of despair and seeming like they will never work their way back up, seem to suddenly soar at the notion of love.  We were put on this earth due to one reason.  Love.  We were made in God's image, everything that we are, God is and more!  The only emotion I can think of that would lead a person to all kinds of actions.  A brother who loves his sister may beat up a bully, or "gently warn" a potential boyfriend.  A husband can love his wife so much that he would cry just watching her sleep.  My experiences with love have mostly been on the lighter side of things... mostly friendships.  But some friendships can become as emotionally intertwined as other relationships... sometimes even more so.  I, thankfully, have at least been blessed to have an amazing friendship with at least one person.  I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't have at least that one friend.  I believe that life would be a lot harder on me if it wasn't for that one person.  That one friend.  I love having someone to talk to, someone that's unjudging of me, and willing to listen.  I also enjoy the feeling of being needed.  It makes me feel like I actually have some sort of role or importance in this world.  What am I here for?  I'm not completely sure, but I have a feeling that at least at this point in my life, I'm meant to be here... where I am... discovering what I need to in order to live and to love.  I feel a part of my purpose at this moment is to be an outlet of God's strength for at least one person.  Thank you God, for your strength, and for the gift of knowledge of you, that I don't need to have ALL the answers ALL the time.  You'll give me the ones I need, when I need them.
