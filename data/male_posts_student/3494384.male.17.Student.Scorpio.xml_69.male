Met up with Victor in school at around 3. Late for an hour. I cant believe that school's lab are FULL. What the hell... Much people lorhz. My objective is to go scan something for my school project. How dare those computer are all occupied. So went changing lab.   But something happen. Neither my friend or me knows how to operate a scanner. I was like scanning happily then the result is not what I desire. What shit.   Decide not to scan in school. Called up Lishen and ask if his scanner is still working and such so I could like go his house scan and thus he can also help me in it. Was on phone with Wanxin the whole afternoon or so. Decide to meet up for dinner after that.   Then called up Xinhui and she happily still in school doing project. She asked me for help in settling up a tag board for her blog. I went all the way from my school bus stop to business school and look for her in the lab. Manage to help much. But I dont what shit I did and almost ruin her blog. So careless of me.  Late for like 10 minutes when we went meeting with Wan Wan aka Wanxin. Have sudden craving for Pastamania so they all agree lorhz to eat there. Was pretty hungry cuz I didnt ate anything since I woke up. While waiting to eat. He sms me. My mind was on him and the sms. Wondering what he's doing and such. He then called. That didnt help much. Went to arcade and how dare Wanwan and Xinhui dare let me play what Para Para. So no face lorhz... Also play some House of Dead or something then so much fun lorhz... Wanwan didnt play but she scream like she's inside. SOOOO CUTE~ Have much fun larhz...  But then...   I'm so fake. Acting all so happy for alot of times today when my mind is on the other side of Singapore. Thinking of him.   I've so many feelings bottled inside me the whole day.   Cold and Hot. Silent and Noisy. Like or Love?  Sometimes I just wish that my friends are always beside me.
