I am not happy...  went to the doctors this morning - stress is getting to me again - not sure how to relax...i'm only on edge cos the headmaster (AJ Baker esq., MA., COCK) has threatened to kick me out the school...so i'm not sure if i should get a job, carry on working or go on holiday somewhere...  so basically now i'm just gonna do my best, try and stay relaxed and ignore everyone...basically be an intovert obsessed with work.  gonna sort these posts out...gives me somthing to do seeing GAY IDOL MARCO SELCI decided to be a wanker and hang the fone up on me when we're tryin to decide what to do...the arrogant asshole.
