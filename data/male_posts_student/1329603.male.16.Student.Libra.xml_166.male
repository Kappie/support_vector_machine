Yuck, evil precipitation must be shot (probably by Fi who apparently knows a lot about guns, oddly enough).  I've got John Y's memorial service tonight, and I just want to say that this is almost certainly the last thing I'm doing for St. Mary's Choir. The reception I got last night was one word - "Ah." from Frank and a number of cold looks. Well, thanks St. Mary's, if I want a warmer reception, I'll jump in the fridge.  I'm in a perpetual state of slowed-time, as I wait for tomorrow and the Les Mis rehearsal. I love it. Seriously... let it come quickly and then last for days. Love.  Anyways, I'm going to stop now, hopefully will be OK tonight...  Quote of the day: "And day by day this pathway seeks, Since her silent to love it. The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart, A fountain ever springing... All things are mine, since I have faith, How can I keep from singing?"  From   My Life Flows On   Love, Jon Roskilly
