I figured Triple H had a groin injury,  and was near  to his wedding (real life wedding that is) with Steph, that he'd drop the belt.   I had figured he'd drop it to Jericho.  Instead...  HHH does the least amount of wrestling possible in the Chamber match and wins it.   I got no problem with Goldberg jobbing...in fact, I'm glad he did.  I llike the idea of Goldberg having to face HHH in a "must retire match" at the next PPV.  I hope Goldberg loses.  And I think he will.  Bill Goldberg doesn't do house shows.  He's only there  for TV.  My guess is, they're going to build up to the next PPV, and then Goldberg's gone.  As far as the rest  of Summerslam?  As an Austin mark goes, I enjoyed the Shane/Bischoff match, but I was hoping for a bigger bump on the end of Shane-O  All I could think during the 'Taker-A_train match was"please find a way to trade Undertaker to RAW and let him feud with Kane"  Speaking of Kane...  I'm all for his push and all, but for the love of Jericho, quit burying Rob Van Dam.   RVD has the potential of being the next mainstream breakout star of wrestling.  The only three others who have made that feat were Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold, and The Rock.   For the love of Sammartino, WWE, give RVD the push!  And as far as Brock vs. Angle goes...this feud is better off without any McMahon involvement.  These two have the potential to eclipse the Hulk vs. Andre feud.  Brock Lesnar is a monster, and in his very short time in the WWE, he's become one of my favorites.  Angle has become universally recognized as one of the best.     I hope the writers are smart enough to push the feud to WrestleMania XX.
