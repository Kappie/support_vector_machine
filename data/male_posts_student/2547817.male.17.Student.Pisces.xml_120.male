I know I wont meet this self imposed dateline, but what the heck. Still have to do about 5hrs of econs work and a lot of geography revision and a lot of Tamil memory work. Oh well... Take it as it comes. I just know that I have to finish the bulk of my work by this week coz I'm going into CAP next week. Will definitely have a ball. It's a period of tribulation too.  I realized that I know things about leadership. I should write a list called, "What Tim knows of how to be a good leader." Also, I've been thinking about nonconformists and how society and ourselves can coexist. It's not A.B.C. but it's a conceptual notion which could materialize if we knew how.  The wounds on my wrist and arm close and heal. I think the one's inside me are doing the same, but I caught myself thinking about her as I ate lunch today. I don't think I want to let go. That's all about that for now.  Yesterday was Mummy's birthday. I don't know how old she is but that doesn't change anything does it. It's a natural cycle. The annual event repeats itself many times till you expire. It's a count down, except, it counts up. Nothing particularly celebrate(able) about a birthday when you come to think about it. It isn't an indication of maturity, but it does tell you how much time you have left before you die. Celebrate that then. It also tells you when you're allowed to watch NC16 films, then RA films... smoke... drink... have sex.. (officially that is). HURRAY FOR BIRTHDAYS!  Des and I had a good talk about our fathers. I told her about my past. I'm not sure if I should tell you. It's funny how we all take things for granted. When we were young, everything taught us about why we shouldn't take things for granted. But we still do. I guess we forget the fairytales and nursery rhymes we were raised on. Maybe it isn't our fault that our young minds couldn't take the laborious over-repetition. Maybe it wasn't our fault we took the advice itself about jealousy, heartbreak, humility and everything else for granted. Everything happens for a reason. Just do yourself a favour reader. Go tell your parent(s) and grandparent(s) that you love them. Don't do it quickly. Take their hands, look them in the eye and mean it coz you know you do. There's nothing to be ashamed of; for when you truly value someone, every simple phrase takes on a whole new meaning.  You'll realize that your mother's "pick up your clothes" is for your own good and that your father goes out of his way to drive you to school and bring you home because he loves you.
