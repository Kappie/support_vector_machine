I am not naming the place, as they were nice and hooked us up, the food was good, and i really think this was a rare type of mishap, but free dinners, what could be nicer. missed school this morning. Slept through both my alarm and the herd of waterbuffalo that live upstairs. It begins again. I will never win perfect attendance.  Am officially a regular at the tower. The servers called f. and i regulars. I hope that does not make us as scary as the other regulars. I am meeting K. tonight after my night class for an annie's evening of the sort we have not had in years. It will be nice to catch up with him, haven't beenseeing him much recently because of school. All i have been seeing alot is F. because we study together, and she makes me leave my house so that i actually study. Thanks to her i haven't fallen behind. well, back to work cheers
