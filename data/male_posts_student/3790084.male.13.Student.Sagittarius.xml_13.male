I just want to stuck my earphone and cares nothing what's happening around me for just a moment... before i totally wake up... heheh  I think today i no need to do much teachings because the schol teachers are going to use the computer lab for some online purposes... I waws just told that this programme is summoned by the government... Really don't know what it's about..
