Any way, my irons were pretty good if I took my weight back to my right foot fully, so he lectured Tom Buley andme about that a bit. Then my balance was a bit kinky, so he put me ona foam balance board shaped like a semicircle and had me take every position (standing, stance, coiled, and follow-through) all in balance. It took me a while to get thehang of it, but eventually I did it right and I was able to sense my balance a lot better on the ground. Then he handed me the driver... With my increased balance, the focus shifted back to getting my weight back and then my hands pulling my body through. I was bombing 220 yarder after 220 yarder reasonably straight, and my misses were blocks when my hips came through too quickly. Dolph says those are better mishits than snap hooks because they land softer (I know that from experience). So his quote was the title of this post "just bore your playing partners with nice short straight shots". We tried to see what happened if I tried to crank my swing into a higher gear, but when Ido that my old habit of hips first comes through and I put the ball out right. He says I shouldn't worry about working the ball too much, just hitting it straight. I can also tee the ball higher and play it further forward in my stance on all shots. This will give it a bit more hang time and softer landings. Tommorow I may play nine or just practice before flying out to california at 5 o'clock. So it was a good lesson.
