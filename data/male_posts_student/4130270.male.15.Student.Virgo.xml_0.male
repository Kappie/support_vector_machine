Bush went about revenging 9-11.  I believe with popular support that he used 9-11 for his own twisted plot to capture Saddam Hussien.  I don't believe Hussien had anything to do with 9-11 and furthore more I believe Bush hasn't been looking for Osama Bin Laden with all of his power insteed he has ben focusing on Hussien.  Now that I have either made you completly hotter than a teapot or mad you say Hallaluia there are sain people in this nation I am going to explain myself.  It has been proven by many by many political leaders including republicans that Bush has wanted to go to war with Iraq since before his term even began.  Actually in my opinion he has wanted to go ever since his father was unsuccessful.   I believe that Bush started using tactics since right after 9-11 that would make the general public "satisfied" with the capture of Hussien.  The tactics thatI speak of are his constent speeces/remarks about how bad Hussien is, how he is in league with Al-Quida, and how Bin Laden is hiding in Iraq.  Also Bush has been refering to Bin Laden and Hussien as little more than one unitfor so long many people have decided if you capture Hussien Bin Laden is no more.  But in reality Bin Laden is still out there and so is the terrist threat.  All this WAR, Not Freedom Fight, Has done for us is kill hundreds of American Soldiers and increase our National debt sooo much that we have to raisae our dept limit or not "pay our bills".  Now don't get me wrong except for this one MAJOR disagreement I have with him I like most of his other view points.  Now if I made youmad post to tell me how wrong I am and I f you agree with me post to help me with anything I left out.  Hope to Reasd from YOU soon.  Laterz,
