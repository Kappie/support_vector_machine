Some of the photos are adverts, from a stupid computer game (GTA III). I found most of them really funny, but you might not get them if you haven't played the game.    You decide on what this is, I just feel like eating it. Looks so delicous. :D (jk hahaha)    An advert from GTA III, some of you might not get it, but just go on in that case.    My dream car, wow, it even has a steering wheel!    Spit in my hand, b*tch!    Another advert from GTA III  Sorry if this wasn't up to the normal level u guys, I'm just really busy revising, as you could have noticed from the earlier posts, I have seom hilarious stuff left for next time though :))
