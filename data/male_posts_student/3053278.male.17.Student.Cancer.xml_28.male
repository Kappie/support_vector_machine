Ok the Pedro Martinez one came early this morning when jay reluctantly told me that the minor league team he was gonna play for was owned by the Red Sox and Jay knew I hated them so he didn't tell me? Maybe  I talked to Amanda today who is now in college and I don't know what type of connection that has with the dream.  Now the reason I posted this dream n the first place was b/c Mer was in it. She was unable to pull me off Pedro b/c she hurt herself...Turns out that Mer fractured her finger and can't fence for 2 weeks. There's still more to this connection I need to figure out... Especially the part with Em...Oh well  One thing that has happened recently is the feeling in my right pinky is bothering me. It's lasted for a couple days now and I don't know what to do. Sometimes it's a little numb but I have to deal with it.
