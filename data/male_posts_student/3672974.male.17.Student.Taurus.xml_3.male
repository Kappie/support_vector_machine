I usually actually wake up around 9 but decide to just stay in bed... what a great life! After having my usual pop tarts for breakfast, I came up to my room, where I am trying to organize all my school papers, a task I've been too lazy to start for months. What's great about summer is that you get to do a lot of thinking when there are no pressing deadlines or anything. I've had so many great ideas over the past few weeks, but what's tragic is that so many of them are forgotten before I can write them down. Imagine how much greater the world would be if people never forgot great ideas they have. I don't think I've been myself lately. Not just lately as in the past few weeks or months, but years. Probably ever since I got to high school. I don't remember ever feeling truly comfortable. I haven't  really  laughed with my "friends" in high school. This past year, I felt like an emotional wreck all the time, sometimes just angry at everything around me, but mostly too tired to care about anything. I've noticed that I'm usually angriest during the afternoon. I've realized that the afternoon just isn't my time of day. I'm more of a middle-of-the-night person. That's when I am the most productive, when there are no distractions, and when no one else is working. I guess then that I must love solitude and being away from people. That makes perfect sense. I absolutely hate waiting in long lines for anything, I hate crowded movie theaters-I love seeing movies midday on a weekday- and I guess I love going anywhere during the off-season. I don't necessarily think I'm antisocial, I just think that I don't like having to compete with a buncha other people to get my message out. I can just see myself as the guy working behind the scenes who does the most important work but gets no credit. Anyway, I want to revisit the post that got deleted. I was musing on how I hate those people who seem to do everything - do everything well, I might add - with a smile on their face and no sign of stress. Many people seem to fit into this category. Everything seems to be perfect for them. They're smart, athletic, charismatic, hard-working, and funny, and they never seem to get tired. ARGH how I wish I could be more like that. I guess I don't despise them as much as I envy them--or should I say the idealized image they project. I'm sure that no one, no matter how "talented" (i'll comment on this word later) can really be that perfect. Deep down they've got to be enduring stress and pressure just like the rest of us. They just have some driving motivation that keeps them going through the inevitable obstacles. So I guess we all need to find that one thing that keeps us going. I don't think I've found mine. That's why I'm so lazy and why I'm getting so disorganized. Heck, people might think that  I'm  one of those perfect people. Hah! I may be smart and seemingly organized, but I definitely have a lot of flaws. Which brings me to "talent." I don't think that those perfect people are "talented"; in fact, they may be the opposite. See, I think talent is not memorizing and regurgitating information or working until you're exhausted. Talent is being able to discover something or produce something original, like a song, a work or art, or just a good idea. Talented people are those who try to get closer to the meaning of life (I know it sounds cliche). I believe that there are so many things to discover in the world--the infinite ways that everything is related to everything else. Even the slightest change can produce great effects. That's why I believe that, in everything in life, one must look at the details to produce truly great results. That just reminds me of that volkswagen commercial, where someone picks up something for someone else, then the second person helps out another person, who helps out someone else, and so on. The little things in life are what make it memorable. Those perfect people are working so hard that life is just gonna pass them by.  This isn't all. Trust me, I've got more rant to come...
