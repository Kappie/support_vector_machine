For someone who is John’s age you would figure that he would have some self-control. He should have kept it to himself and worked through his schoolboy crush. I may be biased because I am old fashioned (John is married), but it seems John would have been better speaking to a therapist about his feelings.  The other thought that the case provoked was the interns insistence that this was sexual harassment. Although I agree that John made a mistake, I don't think this was sexual harassment. My experience in life is only 24 years and maybe half of that I have been thinking of the opposite sex so I am not an expert, but is a crush sexual harassment? Was she really harassed? If I were to put a label on it, it seems more discriminatory than harassment.   So now the damage is done. What should John do? As CEO of the organization he may have to bite the bullet on this one. His candor although admirable was foolish. Because of the subordinate/mentor issue and the difficult journey the board would face in damage control if they backed John up, it would be in everyone’s best interest for John to resign.
