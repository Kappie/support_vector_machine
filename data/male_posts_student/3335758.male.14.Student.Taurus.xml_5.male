"I think we should just be friends" "Sorry" "-Jocelyn"  then i wrote "Why?"  and she wrote: "1.)I personally think that you cannot build a relationship on guilt or lying and both of those were the foundations for ours. 2.)I like other guys and it isn't fair for you. 3.)I don't need or want a serious relationship."  Ya that's about it i felt so empty for the rest of the school day and i really hope that you read this Jocelyn cause I thought we had something, I love you, WHY?!?!
