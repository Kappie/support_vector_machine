In the past, we were able to talk regularly, We had numerous chances to meet physically... Talk to each other personally. What has happened here? What happened? How weird these feelings are, We have came so far, Yet our relationship became too sour. I don't know anymore, All I know is that I'm tired... Tired of waiting, Tired of sitting, Tired of writing. I'm sorry, It is time to say goodbye, Time to move on and fly. Time to catch up to my own time, I wish you the best, Though I wished that we could have overcame this test, This distance that tore our friendship apart. I guess I failed you, I deeply apologize to you. It had been such a wonderful moment, Now it is time to let it go, For I have become tired... So very tired... Of waiting, Always waiting. I have become so very tired.
