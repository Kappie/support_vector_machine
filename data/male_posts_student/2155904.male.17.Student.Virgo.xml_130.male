They are at a bad time cuz Tyke is tired and he wants to go to sleep and they are usually after a good day that Tyke wishes wasn't over.  And also it means that the last day of the week is coming which means that a new week will be beginning.  So as Tyke recaps today's events, just remember that Tyke is not having fun blogging the day.  Today started off at 10 AM for Tyke.  He got up and ate and showered and had a grand time reading the Times.  Then he went and got his haircut.  "Military-style" is the description of choice for Tyke.  But he always gets it pretty much the same and his hair grows pretty fast so that is why he gets it short.  He doesn't like the looks of it to begin with but Tyke really isn't too caring about personal appearance.  He likes looking different now.  You can probably tell by all the retro stuff he wears.  Although, by wearing that Tyke looks very much like everybody else now as it is the fashion of now.  70s shit is in hardcore if you look around.  Tyke even wears 2 shirts that his dad wore in the 1970s.  Yeah, literally wore in that great decade.  But it's fun.  And the aviators Tyke wears are just really cool.  Annnnnyyyyway after that Tyke went home and right as he was about to get home Macaroon called him.  So they planned stuff out to do.  Tyke went over to Macaroon's and was joined by Skippy, Amed, K-caj, and of course Macaroon.  They played bball first at Coug Ridge and they had a lot of sick shots that almost did , or did, fall.  Tyke won 21.  They played for a while but then went to Macaroon's and they played some poker.  $1 buy-ins so as to try and keep something of a sense of dignity to the game and it sorta worked.  But then they had to leave by 2:30 in order to pick up the Costco pizza and get back to Tyke's in time for the UW-Stanford game.  So at 2:15 they decided that if nobody won the pot by 2:30 then everyone would take back their buck and it would be a free game.  Well on the last hand Tyke bet 39 of his 40 cents on Macaroon and he called.  Then on the river Tyke bet his last cent and won with a pair.  So Amed was, to say the least, pleased cuz he did not want to lose the dollar.  After getting pizza and going to Tyke's they flipped on the game.  Man, this was a great game.  The WSU game was more exciting though.  But this one finished much better.  It was just spectacular.  And Nate the Great is such a stud.  He can jump so high.  After the game Tyke really wanted to play bball so they all went up to the court by Tyke's house and played there.  The team of Tyke and Macaroon played well but the team of Tyke and K-caj did not.  K-caj did start hitting some long 2s with the extremely wet ball though.  Tyke couldn't finish left handed for some reason but his left hand did the trick.  And Tyke is learning some good post moves now.  He just is getting much better this year at basketball.  He uses his size, all 6' 130 pounds of it, to really get an advantage.  And he didn't want to stop playing tonight.  Even though it was dark.  He wasn't tired.  He coulda gone on for a while more.  But they went back to Tyke's and talked online to some people.  Then they invited Tank out to dinner and back to Tyke's (that only sounds a little gay).  So they met up at Teriyaki Bistro and had a good time there.  Amed made his usual Asian jokes except he didn't notice that there was an Asian lady standing right next to him while he said it.  Yeah, that was hilarious.  He felt bad for it but it was still hilarious.  The gang watched some of the classic videos and laughed well.  Then they played another game of poker.  Tyke made it to the last three after Amed went out on the second hand and Macaroon after a while longer.  Then K-caj ended up winning it.  After Tank left, Amed came back and they played some The Shit.  Then they played some ESPN and everyone left.  And then Tyke blogged.  And then Tyke said good night.  Good night.
