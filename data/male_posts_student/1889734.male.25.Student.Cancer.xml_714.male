They're going to have to scrap the 35 hour work week and trim jobs.    France is in for some very real problems in the future, and this is one of the reasons I worry about a future EU-USA conflict in a generation or two.  Europe as a whole is facing a declining population and a contracting standard of living as a result of thier great experiment with socialism.  While not as extreme as Russia, things are going to get much worse before they get better.  To become more competitive in the world, unemployment will increase even more, and austerity measures must be imposed on budgets, cutting back on social services while you have a population growing more dependent on the 'safety net'.    Desperate people who have grown up to believe they are entitled to a government provided standard of living can be quite violent when facing reality.  This could get ugly.
