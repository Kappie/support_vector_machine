Though the title sounds like I didn't do much...really it took up the majority of the day haha. Proud to say though that I am now definitely in Central Jazz, I can't wait until next year =). And my balling skills are slowly on the climb again as I start balling at UCC more often now...yay two things done in one day =).  My day started off at 830 this morning, as I had to get up and go to my school for auditions. So had a bowl of oatmeal *meh* and then headed out the door with my trombone and the audition piece "Caravan" by Chicago. Yeah now, I know why people say that Jazz/Funk music is probably the best music of all time. I don't get how the heck it ever died out, but the music is actually amazing. I need a Chicago CD now, or Duke Ellington haha. I wonder where I can get this old school stuff. Ebay? Some old CD stores? Meh...it's good music though, I suggest you people go get it =). It's actually music worth buyin' unlike 50 Cent or Eminem, or those dreadful Making the Band people. American Idol is barely tolerable, the only reason why I give credit is because they actually have some talent.  Anyways off to my school, I get there around 930 or so. Fred, Craig, Garrett, Adam P. and Christian were already there workin' away at their parts of the music. Christian ran in to do his audition, while the rest of us continued practicing our pieces. Hmm...practice went well, and I found out today that I can easily hit two octaves now almost. Actually if it were on bass trombone I could do three octaves, but I only had my King Trombone with me today, so no F Attachment to make life easier. Anyways after Christian was done *which he made it in I think* Pourier went in to do his audition. I didn't hear much of it, but I did hear a few blips.  So after his audition he walked in and said "Joe, Wharton wants you to audition now." So then I walk in, and Pourier adds "Oh yeah, she wants me to spectate also." To my surprise though when I walk in, Wharton was surprised to see me volunteer *I'm usually the lazy one that waits* and also finds it funny why Pourier was still there. So after she finally found out what's happening, she boots out Pourier and then off I go with my solo.  She said my solo was well done, even though I think I sucked. But oh well no complaints from me...I'm in Jazz. And that's the story of the evolution of Joe from average tromboner to Jazz tromboner...summarized somewhat =P.  After the audition and returning home, picked up some food at McGreasePlatter and also at Angelo's. After grabbing the food, I finally get home, eat, and then hover in front of the computer for the next hour and a half, spreading the good news of being one of the 4 jazz tromboners in Jazz, just chatting, and trying to plan out both the Paramount thingy in July and also if I'm gonna go see dodgeball next week w/ Carmen, Josh and them.  Hmm well what I thought would be an hour and a half turned out to be two hours and a half in front of the compy, as I started playing Empire Earth again. Oi I gotta stop it's getting too much fun. Well after realizing that it's getting lame and also that it isn't good sitting in front of this box that long, I finally decide to go outside and play some ball.  After 45 minutes of ball or so, I return back to my house, cooled by the A/C and grabbed some stuff to eat. Drummed, played the piano for a bit, and before I knew it it was 5pm and it was time to go play ball.  Balling today was pretty fun/productive/hilarious. Met up with Jason and Calvin around 5 and then headed into the UCC. They actually have a anti-sneaking in system installed now...  One of those revolving metal pole thingies that are at the gates of almost every amusement park, except this one doesn't lock. It just makes a noise lol. Anyways cramming our junk into a locker, we head up to the gym...  And for some reason today was like Asian day or something. Two 4 on 4 games going on, and BOTH of them had 8 Asians on each court. Weird, usually it's a clan of black people or like a mix of cultures, but today it was as though Asia was the only existent continent. Anyways so we played some ball on our own first, but then we started a two on two game with this other dude, who was the only white guy there lol.  It started off with me and Calvin dominating 7-0. But I don't know what happened, afterwards we ended up losing 11-9. I think it was because I began shooting wild 3 pointers and since I'm not exactly the best perimeter shooter *I'm terrible* yeah we kinda lost lol. I made a few nice layups though plus set up one or two decent plays. But the highlight....I made 6 blocks in total, 3 on jason and 3 on the other guy. I'm like Ben Wallace, only I'm Asian, and I'm much poorer at ball than him =P. Blasted Jason and his clutchness....if he had lazied just 4 more points we woulda won. Oh well after that since the guy left, we decided to play a few games of American 21...  Where 2/3 of the games was total B/S lol. The first one was somewhat normal, with us alley-ooping one another a numerous amount of times, but the 2nd and 3rd game...Calvin won from shots from half court that we deemed as the "5-Point line." Yeah we twisted around the rules just a bit, making the foul line worth two points, 3 points from perimter and 5 points from half court haha. So even with 13 rule in, it was nearly impossible to actually fall for it. Anyways me and Jason pretty much lost all hope after calvin made 7 shots from half court in total from the 3 games, and so we began to foul one another to stop the onslaught of points coming from any of us....if we even had points left from the mass alley-ooping. So after two hours of pure chaos, including 2 on 2 games, American 21, and Kill, we finally tired out and all went our seperate ways home. Well I had to give Jason a lift since his dad wasn't home. Oh yeah also...NEW HIGH SCORE IN CHEESY CELL PHONE SOCCER GAME! 69 POINTS! EAT THAT! *yes I realize it seems like I have no life =P*  Anyways getting back, watched Zoolander on TBS, and began to play the piano. Argh last lesson of the year next week...the wretched practicing...so close to being done for the summer =).  Anyways back to keyboardin' the 88 keys.  Oh yeah before I close....list of things I forgot:  -record my madd trombone skillz for Jenn -Need new drumheads still -Go to the Athlete's World 50% off sale...if it's still happenin'. I need new shoes =P...Adidas Superstars.... -Make plans to see a movie next week.  Anywho yeah now I'm done for the night. Hehe later.
