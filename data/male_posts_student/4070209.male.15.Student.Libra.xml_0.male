Well today was an okay day for me because we didint have classeshalf day only.....But we still had our Religion UT...........Today was different bacuase we went somewhere that i dont know were we are.....We went to a scince somthin somethin its about science experimentations.....But it was something good for because we learn things thruogh those experimentations................After that we my brother fetched me and we went around to find a billiard table that he wants coz he wants it to put it in our new garage cz we have space yyaaaahooooooo................. But the last thing i will do tonight is prepare my things for tomorrow because im goin to my friend's house to study because he invited me....For methere is no other option because the workers are still workin on our newgarageand they kept on hammerin to make a hole to the entrance of the new garage......It was very harsh for the ears it kept ringin and ringin until now........but anywayzzzzz its still nice to be here just typing and thinking "what will i do next?"..........Well this is it for today...............................Peace out remember patience takes you a long way.........................................You will see why   ]
