We were having art, and i didnt bring my canvas as usual. shit like that. mr ng started to be uber irritating, scolding student after student. when he came to sheng hao, it was rather long. he verbally insulted sheng hao's people (citizens of China Rep). which sheng hao was rather ticked off at. but he remained quiet nonetheless. mr ng got bored with him so he went on the ming jie, then started scolding the class as a whole. he slammed the door and left, came up with two beta forms. one for sheng hao and another for ming jie. sheng hao didnt want to fill it up cos he knew that he didnt do anything wrong. eric and him had a little debate and stuff, and mr ng asked, "were you polite?". and sheng hao said yes, and he said "you sure?" i butted it cos i couldnt stand it, and i said, "yeah im very sure he was because he apologised and kept quiet." unfortunately that wasnt the answer eric wanted to hear so he asked me the same quesion again for about 3 times. of which all i came up with the same answer. he got pissed and he changed his attention to me, and i got rather worked up too. he asked me to leave and i went off packing my bag. i had a piece of scrap paper on my desk so i crushed it and did what i always do, aim and throw the litter into the bin which was by the door. i missed by a few inches. eric then said, "pick it up." i replied with a yeah i'll pick it up once i leave. he shouted "PICK IT UP!" and i walked all the way there, took the bin and the rubbish. went up to him and slammed the rubbish right into the bin at his face. score. i walked out and it took him a few seconds to process what i have done. he slammed the door open and shouted at me, "you're not happy isit?". and i replied rather loudly, with a YES and some other shit which i forgot due to my STM (short term memory). he shouted, i shouted louder, he shouted again, and i shouted even louder. sheng hao came in the middle and he stopped the both of us before i would actually kick him in the face like i did to some st pats guy. once again that botak blew it, and he insulted china citizens again, and sheng hao was very pissed off, he threw a heavy punch at the door and screamed his lungs out at mr ng, with a chain of vulgarities. sweet. eric just stood there and looked up at him like a kid, (in case u outsiders dont know, my art teacher's name is mr eric ng, and hes very short). Mrs ng heard from the hall and came up to see what was going on, and she took sheng hao for a little talk. i told eric to come inside the class and he said, "why cant we talk outside here?" and i said, "why cant we fucking take a sit?". he obeyed like a little kid and we started to have a talk. he was bitching and bitching, at this time my eyes were rather watery, i was about to break down from the anger, fustration and shock. but i held my tears back, and eric had his eyes watery too, occasionally wiping a tear or two off. heh. well, everything was alright after that, but mrs ng said i still have to get punished, and i said ok. but it was all worth it. that was mainly the action that happened two days ago. now on to yesterday. hmmm...gee i forgot. all i know is that i took a nap in the afternoon. went downstairs to do a maths at night. and uhhh....yeh nothing else. im in the click centre, theres no emaths today cos most of my class are having their o level oral exams now. rather sad. waiting for jon, we're gonna collect the bro picture. yeh. \m/.
