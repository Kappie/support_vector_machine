Yeah, something more than nothing happened. I've been trying to figure out classes and stuff for PCC and I think I've got it down, I just hope none of the classes I'm trying to get into close before I get a chance to jump in there! It looks like the line up will be Psychology 1, English 1A and 1000X, Math 131, and Theater Arts 7B. Five classes, 14 units(English 1000X is a bullshit, no unit waste of an hour of my life), and I'll even have some time do homework before classes.        Ah, aint it grand?        It seems like only a month ago I graduated from PHS, now I gotta go through the shit of choosing classes without the help of a counselor...wait, that sounds just like PHS!! Am I really going to a different school?        I'm so displeased with the administrative authority wielders(or so they think) that I've decided to be a complete asshole, just as they have. All right, all right, I'm not gonna be an asshole...I guess I'm just too nice; but wait, let's ask Nate..."Is Cavs to nice to be an asshole?"    "Man, the devil aint as mean as that mother fucker can be, SHIT!!!"        Well folks, there's your answer. Looks like I'll be getting A S in all my classes, and I'll just fill in the ..shole.        For now, fuck the bastards. For later, "Ah, don't you love the smell of bullshit in the morning?"
