And with some justification, in my view. I believe our cause would be better served by the substitution of more nuanced terms. Instead of  fat , use words like  corpulent  or  Rubenesque .   Dictionary.com may be of some help:  beefy, big, blimp, brawny, broad, bulging, bulky, bull, burly, butterball, chunky, corpulent, cow, distended, dumpy, elephantine, fleshy, gargantuan, gross, heavy, heavyset, hefty, husky, inflated, jelly-belly, lard, large, meaty, obese, oversize, paunchy, plump, plumpish, ponderous, porcine, portly, potbellied, pudgy, roly-poly, rotund, solid, stout, stubby, swollen, thickset, tubby, weighty, whale .   I can't believe they missed  bovine .   Example: Michael Moore is so dumb he couldn’t find his ample butt with both hands and a hunting dog.
