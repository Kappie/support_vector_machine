The only exception was the trombone teacher... well I suppose it was to be expected because I hadn't turned up to a single one of his lessons.  The problem is, I don't see how this is going to improve.  I havn't been able to practise at all over the holidays because of doing Kung-Fu once or twice a day.  And I'm hardly going to be able to practise when I get back if I'm going to be doing 5 A-levels.  So what to do?  If I were to stop lessons the school would be able to take away my music scholarship.  This wouldn't be a problem because all it does for me is to pay my tuition fees - the school fees are already reduced from the Academic scholarship.  In fact, taking away the music scholarship would be singularly bad for the school because I would no longer be obliged to be part of the orchestra, and my role in it is essential.  So let's weigh up the pros and cons of letting it go:  Pros: 1.  I would not have to attend lessons, which will be very difficult next year. 2.  I wouldn't have to practise. 3.  I would not be obliged to be in the orchestra. 4.  There would be no repeat of what happened at the house concert this year.  Cons: 1.  I don't practise anyway. 2.  1/2 hour committment per week isn't much. 3.  Next year in the orchestra I will play first, it might get a bit more interesting. 4.  If I give up, I stand very little chance of becoming head of house; as it is my chances are qutie good.  What to do?
