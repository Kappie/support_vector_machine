First of all, this is all my original work. Quotations and paraphrasing is properly cited (as "proper" as the damn school wanted it anyways), with a  Works Cited  page included. Second, don't steal or copy. That's just bad taste. Quote if you like, but please give credit where credit is due (in other words: cite properly). Third, let me know any error you find in wording (like a misspelling that I didn't catch). I'll fix it and republish and give you credit if your ego likes that. :)   urlLink Research Paper (Adobe PDF, 116KB)
