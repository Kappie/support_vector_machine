Don't think that I'm annoyed, ganyan lang talaga ako. If I were in front of you at that moment you think I'm annoyed. After I yell at you, I'd smile and giggle annoyingly. You have to understand, I have a neurologist (for real) and she says I have this psycotic or was that neurotic disorder. Anyway, that.  Don't say sorry about what you believe in. Say sorry if you've offended someone. I don't think you have offended me. Not yet, so far, anyway...
