It seems to be cool so far, but I haven't yet used it due to my slow-as-butt, over-the-phone-line-with-no-filters modem.  It's only 78% done dowloading.  As soon as it's finished, I'll be happy, because I frequently fantasize about my donwloads completing problem-free.  It's a rarity.  Expect pictures in the future.  Or not.  I will probably drop this blogging thing in a few days, because I can never seem to commit to something like this.  Maybe it will work out, though.  One can hope.
