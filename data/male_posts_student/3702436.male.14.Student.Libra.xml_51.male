HAHhahaha. i started by asking him when tramp comp was then progressed to asking him what the thought of me. finally i capped it all of by saying ive been very fond of him all this years. u shud see his reaction man! damn Blardy farnee. "...innuh!!!! jenhan what do i do now?!" LOL! and he thought i was being nice the whole time, since i was just sitting there stoning and laughing. little did he know i was the master mind=)  3. regurgitating toilet   apparently its sort of my fault since i dumped loads of tissue in when i was wiping up the mess my ribena made, but that was at 2pm! then boon shing went in to crap at 10, guess what? he flushed once, and not all of it went down. then he flushed again, the water started rising. so he though wth, and flushed again. this time the bloody thing flooded and splattered crap all over the floor. sick. so we made a video of it. OPERATION ASSHOLE! haha. please ask me if u want the video. video quality isnt too good because it was damn dark. by the, dusnt regurgitating toilets remind u of harry potter?   More stupid stuff... so what other things did we do? well basically i myself had 2 blardy stupid videos. daojies got a few. im too lazy to publish what we did on those videos but u can ask for the videos. last night we carried on the tradition. bed fights! consists of a 2 minuted match, in which 2 pple fight on a bed, trying to wedge each other. a win is 3 pts and a draw is 1 and a lost is 0.   so basically after one night it goes like this.  1. jingheng and i - 7 pts 2. daojie - 3 pts 3. boonshing - 0 pts  booonshing u suck!!! haha daojie wedged him in 8 secs!!! and i wedged him in the last second of the game. bloody jingheng is violent. grabbed me and started banging me on the bed partition. but i still held out. Muahahhaa.  commontests commontests have been rather fubared. amath was crap. left 10 marks + blank. not enuff time sia. then ss was a bit guailan, hopefully i din screw up too bad. bio was harder than usual, but still ok and geog was guailan, but shud be quite ok.   training.  trained 5 times this week. unbelievable. i think we trained more than some of the artistic pple. training as usual = training. so nothing interesting here.  ah. one week worth of events. lol
