On one hand, I'm not getting paid and I have to take care of a bunch of kids all day. On the other hand, I'll actually be busy during the day and then next year I'll be able to make money as a counselor. I think the pros outweigh the cons. It rained again today. I'm really getting tired of all this rain. It's suppose to rain again tomorrow.  I talked to Darren on MSN. He said that he could supply me with all the weed I want. This is good news. I was semi-planning on going to his house tonight but of course dad came home pretty late so now we'll be eating dinner at like 8:00. By the time I get home, it'll be too late. And it turns out that mom comes home Saturday, not Monday. Unfortunately Sam got his G1 today.. stupid bastard. But i'm the one with the job. Heheh. I found a pair of sunglasses in my drawer that I previously thought were broken but they're actually fine - one of the .. henges I guess? Anyways, one of them is a little loose. I like sunglasses. Maybe i'll wear them to camp on Monday. Do clothes naturally smell bad when you dont wear them in a long time? I need to buy some Febreeze.  And now it's off to Swiss Chalet.
