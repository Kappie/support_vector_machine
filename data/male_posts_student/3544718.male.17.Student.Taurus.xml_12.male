None of that! If that happened, I would probably be alright, because things happen. No, today is the worst day of my life, because I am confused as to what day it is. It's bad enough just not knowing, but I can't figure it out whether it's Tuesday, or Wednesday. I wouldn't normally have a problem with this, but some very reliable sources tell me it's Wednesday. Anyways, kk' says it's tuesday, so I think I'll be alright.  I just thought of it, but... is TODAY the worst day of my life? Or is it TOMORROW that's the worst day of my life? Anyways...   ps: I'm not lovin' that whole pink thing...
