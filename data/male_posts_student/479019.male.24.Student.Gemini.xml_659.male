I'm going to go on a little rant about a gender myth. It's in response to many girls saying that they are, at a given age, more mature than men. I think maturity is more than just biological maturity, but on an emotional or mental level it's not based on sex. There are all sorts of indidvidual psychological as well social conditioning factors. I think my biggest argument against that myth is that there are correlations between that myth and a patriarchal system in which men are designated as financial providers or authoritative figures. Historically, in post-Victorian eras, women relied on men to pay for dates and do paid-labor. Of course, a man's age and time within the workforce affects his wages. This affects the age disparity in male-female relationships.  Anyway, that's my little rant. It's just a pet-peeve I have.  It's still really cold. I'm waiting for the bus in the computer lab right now.  ***
