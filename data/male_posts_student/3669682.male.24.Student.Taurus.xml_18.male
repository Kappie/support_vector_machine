(For the curious,  urlLink I got   urlLink myself   urlLink one of   urlLink these shirts .)  Yay me. I also got my girlfriend one of the  urlLink the Common Cold  Plush Microbes. It's actually quite big, I'm surprised. I was expecting something tennis-ball size, while it's actually about softball-ball size (if my recollections of what a softball-ball look like are correct).   All in all, I'm happy. I've been waiting for a PA shirt for ages, and now I actually got 2. Yay.
