"'For us, Reagan was important because we knew he was really anti-communist, emotionally anti-communist,' said Zdenek Kosina, 65, a Czech computer specialist. 'For us, he was a symbol of the United States' genuine determination to bring communism to an end.'  Laurentiu Ivan, 35, a customs officer in the Romanian capital, struggled to describe Reagan's legacy and then said: 'It is due to him that we are free.'"  I think in another ten years, we will see similar reactions from the Middle East.
