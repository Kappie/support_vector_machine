As Tyke is blogging right now he is looking up at the wall in front of him and he sees one of those big fly things with long legs but not a daddy long legs humping the wall like there is no tomorrow.  It is seriously vibrating like Tyke cannot describe.  Kinker definitely agrees.  The body of it just shakes incessantly but the legs aren't moving all that much.  It is like it is having a seizure that it cannot stop.  "What if it is?  What if in 2 minutes it just falls and dies?" says Kinker.  Well, then it would be dead and no more vibrations answers Tyke by typing.  Yep, still going.  Anyway, Tyke had to go to school early in the morning today to take an AP English test for extra credit which he desperately needs.  He just didn't focus at all on the test and made up answers so that he would still get the extra credit.  Then he, Amed, Fejj, and Macaroon went to Krispy Kreme's for donuts as a nice little break from the beginning of school.  Then into Farget for some money and blood pressure measurements.  That is always fun.  Tyke is a healthy sum'a'bitch.  Yep, still going.  School was stupid but it didn't suck.  Lunch was not wet today.  Nice and dry.  And hot.  It was greasy though.  Tyke is talking about Pie of course with Amed, Dr. Phil and Purdy.  Purdy is coming out to lunch with Tyke because her "only friend" is gone until next week.  Dotti of course.  After lunch Tyke was talking with Purdy about her 5th period and since she didn't have a car and elementary tutor he let her sit in his car for the period.  She said she would probably take it around the parking lot or something and Tyke didn't care.  So Tyke came out to his spot during 5th period to hang out with her for a little while but wait a second, his car wasn't there!  He called her a few times but she didn't have her cell so she didn't answer.  So Tyke walked around and went to Foods where he talked with Frederique for a few minutes and she offered him some of her smoothie which was pretty good.  Then Tyke checked for his car again and it still wasn't there.  But then he saw some other car coming in and it parked in Tyke's spot.  Luckily there were other spots still open in the senior lot so when Purdy finally came back from her escapade she parked it in a good place.  Tyke came to her after class as she was walking with Tig and she told him where she went.  She just got onto the freeway and got off at the exit by the Lake Sammamish soccer fields and Costco and all those places.  Then she turned left and took the long route back to school.  So she got a nice little ride out of Tyke's car although she wasn't able to use the AC so it was hot.  But it was a fun story for Tyke and a fun one to tell as well.  Still going, but barely.  After school Tyke came home and his mom picked him up to go to his dentist for a wisdom teeth consultation.  It was interesting.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst Tyke's surgery should be about a 4.  He's gonna get laughing gas and the sleeping pill but definitely no IV.  Hopefully there won't be any snags and Tyke will be in pretty good shape when he gets home from the dentist.  The appointment still isn't until the beginning of July though so after Europe he still has something to look forward to.  Tyke also got his suit out for tomorrow.  He finally gets to wear his suit to something other than his senior pictures.  It has been on Tyke's mind that he wants to wear the suit for a while now and now he gets a chance to.  Then he has basketball and then even more fun.  Another fun Saturday in the works.  But then Sunday there is some work Tyke should actually start doing.  Grrr...but until then.  Tyke Turner saying, still going.
