I met Patrick Star, Dora the Explorer, Scooby Doo, and Blue!! I even sat on Blue's thinking chair and sang songs... I got Patrick's autograph as well... But the coolest thing I did was... BUNGEE JUMPING!! Is it Bungee or Bunjee? Whatever. Anyway... Here is a pic of where I bungee/bunjee jumped:  urlLink Click Here  So, they put me on the harness and shit, and I was slowly lifted up until 160 feet, where I was just staring at the ground. Now, instead of them deciding when to let go, I have a pully thing next to me, and as soon as I am up there, I have to pull it... I knew that if I thought about it too much that I would be too scared to pull it, so as soon as I got up, I pulled it and droppeed 160 feet to the ground. I then swung back and forth, swearing in English, Hebrew, and Spanish. Scary shit. I got it on tape. Then I rode the less cool rollercoasters such as Top Gun, Drop Zone, etc *yawn*... Almost fell asleep on Top Gun. Baby ride. I got wet from the water rides though. Which I can still feel on my pruney feet.  I didn't see Alex or Merav during Great America so that's good. Toby, Lucy K and Dylan were there... But they were cool for the most part.  I won 4 things: A picture of Eminem, a monkey, a pig, and a pony. Yay!  So, I had a blast.  Yeah.
