Its true that we dun know what we have got until we lose it, but its also true that we dont know what we have been missing until it arrives. giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they wil love you back, dont expect love in return, just wait for it to grow in their hearts. but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours....
