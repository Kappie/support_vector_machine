It's all climitisation (i'm not sure that's a real word, but it works), i'm not used to high temperatures. it's the same reason that someone from africa would be cold im 25 degree weather.  It's interesting what you think of at 2 in the morning when there's a huge storm out and you've nothing better to do, like what would happen if lightening hit my house? would it be loud? then i think...what if i got hit by lightening? wouldn't it be cool if i got super powers from it? imagine having the power to shot lightening from your hands! then i think about if i could shoot fireballs too....at this point i realise how fucking tired i am and that i should go to bed...hmmmm good idea. -Matt
