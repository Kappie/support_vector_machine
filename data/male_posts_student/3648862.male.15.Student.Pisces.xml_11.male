I live in a small town in western New York. I am in ninth grade going into tenth. I play the trumpet and I love jazz music. I like anime, by favorite anime is Neon Genesis Evangelion. I also like yaoi which means I am gay, but I do not act like it at all, and nobody knows about it but me. I like to hang out with friends and go to the movies. I also work at DBGT.com; I do anime reviews.  Recent Stuff  Well I am almost done with my finals, which means back to work at DBGT.com doing more reviews. It is very boring. I have a parade this saturday in Wellsboro PA. Lately I have been spending my time in yahoo yaoi chatrooms. My sn for yahoo is supergasaraki, so im me if you wanna talk. Well thats all for now. TTYL
