I'm supposed to be going back to P.A.A.C., and i have to deal with the people there and their attitudes and them saying I have an attitude just because I'm sarastic when I talk to them. But you know what I'm going to try to make this a good expirience. And the only reason why I'm actually going to join P.A.A.C. is because of Kiara and her saying " yeah i want you to come" so I'm gunna go. SO KIARA YOU BETTER BE HAPPY THIS IS ALL FOR YOU!!!!!! I saw Erich at the pool today with Alex and Janel I swam for about  45 minutes and then left with Kiki and chris and went to Walgreens and  Jonathan's house.  Yeah so chichi have a great relationship with "that guy" a.k.a. Erich- Mr. Zettikins   LinZ you're welcome it was a pleasure to come to your play.
