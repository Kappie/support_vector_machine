All the colourful lights and mad shopping are very appealing mind!  2 + 1/2 days to go at school!  I can't wait for that to finish.  A long term comes to an end, along with all the coursework and the words GCSE (eek) finally dissapear into the brances of the Christmas tree... for now!  I've been going out a bit more often now, and I'm starting ot notice myself becoming naturally exhausted and tired at the end of the day.  Its a good feeling, believe me.  Waking up at 7:30 - 8:00 isn't easy :(  And yes, get a load of this, all of our precious sunlight hours are spent at school!  Yep, sun comes up about 8:15 and sets at about 3:51!  How great...  So as the Winter (Hahahahahaha - No Snow) goes on, as the temperature starts to get below freezing, Christmas approaches!!!
