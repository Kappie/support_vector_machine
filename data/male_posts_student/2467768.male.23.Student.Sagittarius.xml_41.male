Sunday Morning, 13th June 2004. UOW Library, once against. I am starting to kick off my studies with BUS316. Frankly, I don't really know, how to pass this paper. Insya-Allah, with his guide, I believe I will. That is also if I put in a little bit of effort.  Tommorrow, my girlfriend will be going to NIE to an interview. I really wish she make thru the interview and become a teacher. Maybe a language teacher, who teaches English. Then, it would be more practical for me in future, I were to relocate and she were to tag along with me  The Hazzie Show... was pretty dramatic..... Tears drop quite a couple fo times. Anyway, i got to continue studying ....
