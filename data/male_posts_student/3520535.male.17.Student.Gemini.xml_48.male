I'm the only one I can think of (I'm sure there are others I can't) who wants to get married, and have children. I want to live in a house somewhere, and have one or two children, a normal life, a job, a wife, go on family vacations, that sort of thing. For some reason, people of my age, generation, personal cliques (mostly of above average intelligence), whatever, don't want to marry, and if they do they don't want children. I'm not saying that this is wrong, but it just seems odd to me that it should be so prevelant a thing. I'm not some bedrock of traditional values; I'm for gay marriage, I'm not even completely straight, and anyone who knows me knows I'm eccentric. I want to travel the world, and unlike those millions who say they'd like to, I definitally will. I have no standard of living to keep. Of course I won't live a normal life in the states, I plan on travelling, hopefully with someone I love, before settling down, in some faraway city, probably two. So what, I'm a romantic, okay? Anyway, I think a lot of it resides in my parents. They're not my people. I seldom get along with them. They don't parent like I would, they don't act like I would. I don't want to live with them. But, they're happy. They didn't provide me with decent housing, but they're really a model of marital relations. They've never seriously quarreled, and love each other dearly. So, sure that I can have the same type of thing, that children will not be in the way of my relationship with another, and wanting to give my children what I never had, and always wanted (isn't that always the reason?) I have a vision of having a traditinal family. Whatever. I need to take a shower.
