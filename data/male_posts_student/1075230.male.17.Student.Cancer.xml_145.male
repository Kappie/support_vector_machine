Mostly just chatted online, played DM5 (among other games), wasted time in general, and worked a bit.    It was either October or November that I didn't hand in a single unit... it's like, there wasn't any change from one TA interview to another. At first, my parents - not knowing how the system worked - did not pay attention to the number of units. Later though... when they finally managed to figure it out, it wasn't pretty ^^;;   Around this time, they had a Walkathon thingy, where you had to walk. I started out walking with a group, then I got tired of going so slowly. So I went ahead. Eventually I reached the school and got refreshments.    Then there was the Anime Karaoke thingy... I sang like two songs XP (terrible, i know) ah... that was when keane said he was grounded and couldn't come to anime anymore (it baffles me that he still manages to come when hoshi-chan visits), and it was the last day that jamie-chan would be at anime. Joe did a lot of the organizing: printing out the lyrics (I hope he still has that entire stack!) and playing the songs.    During the December break, I was so sure I'd be caught up by the end of that... however, I only finished like 2-3 units. Then during the March Break, where I told myself that this was serious... I did only like 3 units.    The Christmas Party at anime was pretty cool... I took a picture with the camera then jumped down and fell splat ^^;; They brought DDR and it was my first time playing. It was also Joe's first time playing (now he's amazing at it while I haven't touched a DDR thingy for awhile).    Besides units, I tried out - and failed miserably - for badminton, went for chess, started learning how to play Go, did some math contests (first for Cayley... yah!), and threw a bday party. Most people who visit this blog was at the bday party i believe...    Ah.. one thing I remember well, was in October, the Halloween party thingy.. i dyed my hair white ^^ that was fun ^^;; I should try more stuff like that sometime.   This was generally a period of non-work... ah, how I would've done much better if I had worked during this period. Anyway, the time of reckoning was near, for soon, April began...   ~Chronos
