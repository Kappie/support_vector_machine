I'm in typing with Antz at the moment.  Mrs Blunt has let us have a entire period of free time because she has a headache or something and she wants to recover before the ball tomorrow night.  I'm not going.   urlLink Jonathan  went last year and he said it was really crap.  I'm going next year, only because it's my last year.  Working tonight, 4 till 8.  Just so you know, I'm a man whore (AKA Checkout Operator at Heaphy Terrace, New World).  Billie-Anne's working tonight, she swapped shifts with Kylie.  Oooooohhhhhh she made me a CD so she'll bring it hopefully.  I don't even know what's on it!  Oh yeah, thought I should mention, I'm hoping to move out soon.  I can't stand living with my Mum anymore.  It's not like I hate her but she yells and I don't respond well to yelling and I get really frustrated.  I suppose I'll have to go on that benefit for people who still go to school but are living away from home.  And I'll need to find flatmates.  I think I'll ring Surrey tonight ...
