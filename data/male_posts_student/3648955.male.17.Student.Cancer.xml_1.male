THe only reason this is happening is, 1) i have no where to go, 2) i have no way of going anywhere, 3) i have no one to go with. Dont i have such an awsome life. I dunno i do kinda feel lucky in a way. Im lucky with some skill and talents :P i do deserve some bragging rights.  I also finally got to talk to Chris after like a week of him not being on. Apparently something happened that i really dont wanna talk about. Either way, i dont even know much of what happened. No details.   Anyway, i was thinking of things to do on my birthday. Im not sure what exactly i want to do. My mom has this plan set to go to Atlantic City. Of course thats her first choice since thats the only place she'll go to as a vacation... This woman has no sense of adventure at all. I really do not want to go to Atlantic City but she also said that Dave Chappelle is preforming live there. That i really wouldnt wanna miss, but i kinda will miss it. Theres nothing to do in Atlantic City. All there is are hotels, casinos, slums, a board walk and a mall. And lets not forget the ever popular Pier.  Ive also been doing some reading and such. Not totally normal books except this one that i got from a candy store when my mom was playing her Lotto. I looked onto the book rack and noticed this book called "In This Skin". The synopsis looked intriguing so i bought it.  The books that i mentioned -- not regular books -- were some technical ones. I download, i never buy. Information should be free, therefore i pirate. Anyway, i downloaded some more ebooks like i always do. I have about 300 MB of books including "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation", "Expert C Programming" (recommended by a friend from Team Teso), "UNIX Network Programming" (both volumes by W. Richard Stevens), and various others. The most recent that i downloaded was "GCC The Complete Reference". Basically an ebook with EVERYTHING on GNU GCC which is the C compiler on UNIX platforms if you dont know. And i only got it because it was curiosity that struck me on various flags and types of makes in Makefile's when you compile certain software and i wanted to know which each meant. The ebook didnt give me really that information, ill have to check with another. It did however give me some other information such as certin inserts and things like:        #include                int main() {       printf("the time is %s\n",__TIME__);       }  Might sound a little lame to people, but i had no idea that there was a __TIME__. Theres many others such as __DATE__, and __BASE_NAME__, and some others. These are not to be confused with __ASM__. It also had some other things... it gave some thorough defintions of pre-processor functions like defines and pragma, etc. It was interesting even though i already knew, but its always good to review and remind.  I always love reading guides, tutorials and books. Information is great. The more you read, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you understand. And the more you understand, the more you live. Thats like a personal 3 sentence motto i go by. It really should apply to everyone. Basically it does.  Im idling on IRC now as usual. Everyone thats not on the western hemisphere is awake. Euro and Aussies are out on IRC now. No disrespect to them, i do have friends outside of the US. Im just bored. Its like 5:40 AM. Sleeping schedule is once again screwed. Its kinda hard to fix. Usually it doesnt happen when i go out, because when i go out i do stuff, and when i do stuff i get tired. So when i get home, i fall asleep at the right times. When youre home all day long, you dont really get tired, your just lazy. Laziness doesnt make many people tired unless your giant and just ate. But anyway, you have to do stuff to get tired. Its hard. Sometimes though when im in this situation i try to stay up as much as i can, then fall asleep at the right time to get a fresh start. That gets very challenging. When you stay up way too long like that i start to get nauseated. Then after the nausea i feel extremely dirty and shitty like i havent taken a shower in years, then you start to feel delerious and paranoid. Its nuts. Thats what happens during sleep deprivation. But you know, thats what caffeine is for. But i have no caffeine except soda, and thats not strong enough.   I really really realllllllly need to get a credit card of my own so i can order stuff. Especially ThinkGeek stuff. *cough* caffeine gum *cough*.  This also reminds me. I was thinking of building a comp. I never really built a comp before, but you know me, theres books to teach you that. So i downloaded "Upgrading and Reparing PC's" and some A+ certification book. I learned a deal of things from them along with the help of a few friends who took A+ and some who build comps for a living. That Upgrading and Reparing ebook is literally 1600 pages long. Its crazy, but who wants to buy it for $60 when u can download it =)...  Anyway, i go to the site that i know is the BEST for hardware, yes you guessed it, NewEgg.com. Most popular, cheapest, etc. I find it totally better than TigerDirect. But there is also ebay, but i dont have an ebay account and i wouldnt really trust it too much. Anyway, i was making an attempt to pick out items that would create a stable enough computer that i can use as a Gentoo workstation at a cheap cost. So i didled around, picked out some parts, layed out the prices and the URL's to them, and then totalled it up to under $500. Im hoping that everything will work with everything. Im like 60% sure it will. Ill have to show my friend after, i havent yet. The things i picked out were at like a minimal level. I have a friends box that i secure at the moment thats a PIII with a Coppermine core and its got only 600 or something megahurtz of ram and it runs totally smooth and nice. So heres the urls to all of them if anyone wants to comment on it, this is also finalizing this post:  case - $019.95 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=11-126-133=1  motherboard - $045.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-128-234=0   ram - $084.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=20-145-006=1   graphics - $053.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-131-228=1   sound - $000.00 - sound is integrated within motherboard.  processor - $070.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=19-112-176=1   cd - $021.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-134-007=1   harddisk - $058.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-134-007=1  pwer supply - $042.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=17-154-010=1  keyboard - $023.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=23-109-125=0  mouse - $019.00 - http://newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=26-105-148=0  TOTAL COST: $434.95
