But you've got to admit that the title above beats my original choice of "Spider-man vs. Van Helsing".  - A little too 'geeky', right?  I had also considered going with "Making a Summer Blockbuster The RIGHT Way".  ...Just not quite as attention-grabbing, eh?  Anyways, you've probably already guessed by now what I'm 'ranting and raving' about this week.  The 'rave' is for one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, "Spider-man 2".  The 'rant' is for the abysmal "Van Helsing".  These two summer blockbusters - in my opinion - represent all that is right - and all that is WRONG - with Hollywood's thinking these days.   Let's start with "Van Helsing".  I went into this movie with the expectation that it would either go to one extreme or the other.  Nevertheless, as a fan of classic horror movies, I actually had high hopes for the film.  I could see where it would have a lot of potential.  I mean, think about it.  You've got exclusive access to three of the classic monsters from Universal Studios's great horror films of the thirties and forties:  Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolf Man; AND you even have rights to use characters such as Dr. Jeckyll and his evil alter-ego, Dr. Hyde.  Combine these legendary villians with the exciting visual capabilities afforded by the new computer-generated digital effects.  Sounds like a winning combination, yes?   Then take the character of Van Helsing - traditionally played as an older, more 'scholarly' vampire hunter - and portray him as a younger 'man-of-action' type.  Write a bone-chilling, action-packed story where Van Helsing is on the hunt for the 'terrible trio', then sit back and watch the box office receipts come in.  Sounds like a 'no-brainer', doesn't it?  Well...a 'no-brainer' is exactly what Universal delivered!  I sat through the two-hour plus "Van Helsing" constantly looking at my watch - just waiting for something to happen.  Now don't get me wrong - PLENTY of stuff was actually happening on the screen.  Nevertheless, nothing really happened.  Not following me?  Let me elaborate.  I must admit that "Van Helsing" has at least ONE rather dubious achievement to its credit.  I can guarantee you that I have never seen a more 'action-packed' movie.  Action-packed in the sense that every single frame of the film was just FILLED with ridiculously over-the-top action.  I don't think there was even ONE completely expository scene in the film where things calmed down for a moment.  Even in the 'quietest' moments, there was always SOMETHING going on in the background.  Basically, "Van Helsing" was a relentless assault on the senses!  Stuff was constantly blowing up, burning, oozing, flying, screaming, howling, - all at billion-decibel sound levels!  Apparently all of the 'noise and smoke' was meant to cover the fact that nobody had actually ever bothered to write a story for the movie.  What precious little story there WAS was lifted from just about every source imaginable - starting with a painful rip-off of the James Bond character, 'Q'.  Just as Agent 007 always stops by Q's lab to 'suit-up' for a mission, so too does Van Helsing stop in at the mysterious laboratory hidden beneath the Vatican (don't ask!) to prepare for battle.  The only difference here is that his weapons and gadgets are slightly more 'period' - rapid-shooting crossbows, for example.  How original!  I don't know about you, but I am so tired of Hollywood films like this - they seem to think that the audience is too stupid to care about a movie actually having an original story.  Heck, just throw a whole bunch of digital effects up on the screen - and make sure the soundtrack is mind-numbingly loud - and everyone will be happy, right?  - WRONG!!!  And what ever happened to writing some characters that you could actually care about?  All of the characters in "Van Helsing" are SO one-dimensional.  In fact, just three months after seeing the film, I couldn't tell you the name of any of the characters in it (well - apart from Van Helsing himself, obviously!).  Seeing as how the producers of this film apparently envisioned Van Helsing as a cross between a  James Bond and an Indiana Jones, why didn't they at least go the extra mile and give Van Helsing some of these characters' faults and foibles.  Instead, he's just a cardboard-cutout 'action hero'.  The part might as well be played by a CGI (Computer Generated Image) character instead of by Hugh Jackman - who actually IS a very talented actor, in my opinon.  It's also interesting to note that, for a movie that deals with monsters from classic horror movies, there's nary a scare to be found.  In fact, throughout the entire ordeal (as I'll henceforth refer to the process of actually sitting through this type of tedium), I only jumped twice; and both of those times I wasn't actually scared.  - I was just reacting to a couple of mind-numbingly loud noises that blasted forth from the Dolby THX Ultra Magna-Power Sensurround Megawatt soundtrack!  Alright, one more gripe about the mindless morass that IS "Van Helsing" and then I'll turn my attention to the one that 'got it right'.  My complaint is this:  why is it that every action movie since "The Matrix" has to feature these crazy fight scenes where everyone has superhuman abilities to manuever in mid-air?!?  Granted, it's fun to watch such crazy gravity-defying scenes, but it just doesn't make sense that EVERYONE in films suddenly has these magical powers to disobey all the laws of nature!   And just what was the deal with the horse-drawn carriage race in this flick?  While watching action flicks over the years, I've been able to accept a wide variety of motor vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.) jumping enormous gorges; but I just don't think that a team of horses pulling a carriage are all that capable of flying across enormous distances.  I don't care HOW much of a 'head of steam' they may have built up!  Yet another example of throwing logic to the wind, I guess; but that's OK...us stupid people in the audience don't know no better, now does we?!?  You know, I'm a firm believer in the fact that not EVERY movie has to be a "Sophie's Choice" or a "Driving Miss Daisy".  I think there's definitely a place for movies that are just mindless escapism.  I can't even begin to tell you how much I enjoyed "Dude, Where's My Car?".  Of course, when you go into a film like THAT, you pretty much expect things to be goofy and over-the-top.  However, I prefer my action films served up with a side of intelligence.   And I think it goes without saying that the one true Unforgiveable Sin in filmmaking is insulting the audience's intelligence.  I recall giving a friend of mine a one-sentence review of "Van Helsing" by saying, "it probably would have been my favorite movie ever if I was still 8 years old."  Of course, who knows...maybe that WAS the target audience for "Van Helsing" - 8-to-10 year old boys!      Alright, enough Hollywood-bashing.  Now it's time to offer up some praise for a truly GREAT summer blockbuster-type film, "Spider-man 2".  Proving that it IS possible to make an action film that can appeal to people well into the double-digits age-wise, "Spider-man 2" hit me like a breath of fresh air!   Hollywood finally got it right!  Now I don't want to discount the awesomeness of the first "Spider-man" release.  It was also an incredible film.  However, I think the general consensus is that the second "Spidey" is exponentially better than the first.  Nevertheless, BOTH are shining examples of how to blend action, drama, comedy, and pathos into a cohesive whole.   So let's examine what makes this film in particular so much better than its fellow 'blockbuster' "Van Helsing".  I think I can summarize it in 5 points:  (1) "Spider-man 2" had a plot.  Someone actually took the time to write a nice story to go with all of the on-screen action and special effects.  Additionally, it looks like the writers even took the time to research the original comic books on which their film is based.  Many plot points for "Spider-man 2" came right out of the first couple of years of Spidey's 'life' in Marvel Comics.         (2) "Spider-man 2" had characters you could actually relate to and care about.  From the misunderstood and confused Peter Parker to the morally-challenged yet still-sympathetic Doc Ock, all of the characters were fully realized people.  I think the audience could especially identify with the stresses and strains of 'young adult life' that Peter Parker went through.  (3) "Spider-man 2" didn't insult the audience by constantly pummeling them with explosions and special effects.  The action ebbed and flowed at a natural rate.  This made scenes like the one where the villianous Doc Ock explosively interrupts an otherwise tender moment between Peter Parker and the love of his life, Mary Jane, that much more dramatic.  I won't offer a spoiler here - you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean.  ...Great stuff!  (4) The effects of "Spider-man 2" - while incredible - never overshadowed the story.  Not unlike the brilliant films in "The Lord Of The Rings" trilogy, the effects just sort of 'blended in'.  They were there merely to help to tell the story.  Now don't get me wrong.  ...I HAVE seen a few films that told a story brilliantly on a purely visual level.  But whether the story is told visually or by dialogue, you still have to tell a STORY!  Unless I'm seriously mistaken, that's the very essence of ANY sort of  dramatic presentation, isn't it?  (5) Last, but by no means least, "Spider-man 2" had a broad appeal.  You don't have to be an 8 year old boy to enjoy this film.  In fact, I know many women (who aren't usually known as Action Movie fans) who've seen and loved this film.  Y'know...guess what, Hollywood bigwigs?  If you want to make a movie that's going to bring in money by the barrelful, you'd be wise to make it appeal to as many people as possible!  Just makes sense, right?    So, in conclusion, I am happy to report that at least a FEW people out in 'La-La Land' are finally starting to get it.  Maybe the success of movies like "Spider-man 2" will help usher in a new era of QUALITY action films - films with a heart, soul, and even mind behind them.  If so, let us hope that such dumbed-down material as "Van Helsing" will soon be relegated to being just a bad memory.  Perhaps filmgoers of the near future will look back at this period and laugh at what USED to substitute for good entertainment 'back in the day'.  I don't know about you, but I've got MY fingers crossed!
