What the hell larhz... I sleep for 8 hours only lehz... Still not enough.  Sms Donkey and greet him good morning and such. Told him that today is studying day for me. He actually replied and told me to study hard worz!!! So happy!!!  Went online for a bit before Donkey came online. Didnt talk to me. I waited for a bit before I initiate a conversation. Once I say hi or something like that, he told me he need to go off le. Then go off immediately.  Hiaz...  Wonder where he is now... Got no mood to study.  Still waiting for your sms.
