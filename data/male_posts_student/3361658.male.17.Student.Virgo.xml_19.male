The site will be located at mopes.port5.com, and probably won't be up for a while now.  Just give it a few weeks.  Once finals are over with though, I will be pumping stuff out of there like there is no tomorrow.  Anyway, if you have any comments, or suggestions for the website just leave them here.  Don't worry I'll get to them.
