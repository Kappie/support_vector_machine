I went postering for the WYO (Woodbury Youth Orchestra) today, and used up all the posters I had at various places around SPP and CG.  I still don't know how that poem came out so well when I honestly had never written one in my life.  Speaking of life...you ever get the feeling that something's not quite right in yours?  Oh yeah-and My Immortal is just simply an awesome song. I've always liked Evanescence, but now they're one of my fav. bands. Does anyone have "Fallen" that I can burn? Anyone?!
