"what is that?" "I don't know" "Think it's fireworks? maybe my neighbors..." "We'd hear it" ... ... ... "It just keeps going" "That's gotta be man-made..." "heh, John, I think God would be a little better than humans at this" "But it just doesn't stop" "Let's get a better look" "Wow" "Ok"  Walking awe-stricken FROM the cars TO the grass to the beautiful grass and the trees in this beautiful beautiful grass... the sky is exploding in this little sphere of earth and we are held in God's soft hands of Nature as the universe ends out _there_... Everything but us is ending and we are all that can ever be again. The other two stop and we keep going because there is a large tree and also because why stop? keep going! This large tree burns without being consumed... there is a field of fireflies seeking refuge from the end of the world in the shade of God's Tree and so we go there too... Time sits on a branch where we can't see him. He is old and black-skinned with a long white beard and he looks on us and strokes his long white beard and smiles... we stand together and unknowingly bring Time joy...  "Heh, you two got a good view of the sky from there" oh yeah, explosions in the sky "You can see it from here!"  Returning to the other two as arcs tear through the clouds...  "Let's go closer" "Think it's safe?" "Maybe" "I think so" "Probably not" "Let's go" "It's not raining" "OK"  Moving Southeast  "whoa! you can hear the thunder and the rain if you listen"  Stop! Yes. Moving again... Moving moving arm around her... still moving as warmth is learned... Stop so the necks might crane and watch Gods hurling the universe at eachother... unspoken agreement lays us all in the beautiful beautiful grass, and we see the rest of the field. A dragon in the clouds!  "There's a dragon! right there! see it? enormous!" "Whoa! whoa! yah, right there! with the wing!" "Hm?? Mine didn't have a wing"  Three dragons in the clouds this epic night vie in slow powerful grace for regal dominance of Heaven.  Time stands twenty feet back where we can't see him and smiles.  A single gossamer wing wrought in delicacy fills the full expanse of the sky and beats slowly downward.  The stars. Explain the stars. On words I invite companions to bridge the sky and to meet the stars before they die in this end.  Time holds his ground.  "Let's go back" "Ok" "Let's run" "Run?" "Wanna run?" "OK! let's run!"  Over the beautiful beautiful grass in the dark feet find ground eyes hardly can see and the other two are ahead but staying behind is better because she is back here. Staying behind reaching the car. Open the door, taking seats, panting and laughing in sweet exhilaration, off to get Ice cream from a store that's closed.  Time walks behind as we take off and smiles.
