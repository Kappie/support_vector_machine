It's a compilation of trying-to-be-funny law review articles.  I'm skeptical, and a little scared that if the cards fall in a certain way, it's a frightening glimpse of my future.  An entry in an anthology, next to two dozen other wannabe-humor writers that took the risk-averse path instead.  But I'll give it a chance and have a review for y'all sometime in the not too distant future (but after exams, probably).
