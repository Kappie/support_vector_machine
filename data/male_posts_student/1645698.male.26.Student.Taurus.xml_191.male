Needless to say, I had a good time in English today.  Bored, but good time.  The one bad thing about the hyperness is the sleepiness(? sentence doesn't seem to make sense) that follows up.    And that's true, Ron is Harry Potter's bitch.  But we all knew that.  And he doesn't shut up with the whining.    Currently, I'm listening to some annoying commercial on the radio about a brand of cheese.  Apparently it's good on bread and good anytime.  MAKE IT STOP!!!
