I'm only seventeen and I already know more about what i'll call "The Facts of Life" than most people. I'll list them sometime. Anyways, today I got lots of news, some good, some bad, and some just kinda made me think twice about my life and the actionsI take. I'm not one of those guys that girls take a second look at. Nor am I the most popular person in school. In fact, I don't have many friends, (I can count them on one hand).Those that I do have, I take seriously and will do anything, well  almost  anything, for them.     During the past year though, my whole concept of"Love" and"Friendship" has utterly changed. I startedmy junior yearat J.M. HanksHigh Schoolwith many things going for me. I just got promoted toplatoon sergent in ROTC. I hadplenty of friends. Lots of relationship interests. Ahead of required class credits tograduate. I had never used drugs.I respected my parents as much as possible. And most of allI still had my virginity, something I promised myself I wouldn't lose til I was married. Everything went well for the firstmonth of school, my grades looked good, I was doin a great job in ROTC and still mananging to have fun with myfriends. then I met four special people. All would have thier own impacts on my life.
