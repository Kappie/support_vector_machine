The only sad thing was that the photo album is short of any good pictures. Boo the editors! Give me the photos, and I'll pick out the good ones for you...  Ok, so the teams left the pit stop in Buenos Aires. Brandon  Nicole got stuck in the mud, and Charla  Mirna, thinking they were friends, stopped to get them help. Charla , in the process, got electrocuted by an innocent looking fence. Poor her! The first betrayal: Charla  Mirna go on a different path. Brandon  Nicole, a few feet behind them, don't even bother honking to warn them...  At the airport, Brandon  Nicole found that all the counters were closed, and they decided to try to call for information. The earliest flight, at 9.10am, was full. The next flight, they thought, was at 10.30am. Everyone queued at the Argetina Airlines counter, but Marshall  Lance decided to go out and investigate. This I have to give them props for. Unless you have no time left, do not be satisfied with what you have. Charla  Mirna followed suit, and hearing that there was a 9.40 flight, ran to a ticketing counter just across the hall, lining before Marshall  Lance. Jim  Marsha helped Brandon  Nicole get tickets, which again violated Nicole's promise to help Charla  Mirna get tickets. In the end, Charla  Mirna, and a very lucky Colin  Christie, without Christie's help, got on to the 9.10 flight.         With that, the teams made their way to Bariloche, Argentina one by one, in 4 seperate flights. They were supposed to find the mayor of the place, but surprise, surprise, there's no picutre of him in the photo gallery. Anyway, from there, the clue directed them to a chocolate factory. Their task there was to chomp through 11000 chocolates to find 1 of 20 with a white centre. To me, and a few teams, this sounded like an easy, almost pleasurable task. However, people almost puked at the amount of chocolate they had to wolf down. I think it wouldn't have been a problem for Mr. Sweet tooth here, but I really haven't eaten that much at one go... So who knows? Charla proved that she was a little monster by zipping past Colin to receive a clue from her dwarf friend. How cute, or rather, coincidental.         Ok, so they head to a mountain thingy where they had to choose between "Rough Riding" or "Smooth Sailing". Nobody chose rough riding but it was a ride down a rough hill that is nothing scary, but slow. To me, the fear of falling down on a rough slope and feeling pain is much more than the fear of heights. Smooth sailing required the teams to go parasailing! Well, all the teams had fun!         After the parasailing was the pit stop. A little island connected to the main piece of land by a strip of shallow water... You know that kind of dreamy thing... Kami  Karli went temporarily blind and swam across insted of walking. But other than that, nothing happened. Aand Jim  Marsha were eliminated, if you were wondering...
