It was the most disturbing collection of freaks I've seen in a while. Naturally, I'm extremely glad that I went. I can handle the Graffiti Weekend crowd: old people, old cars, same old, same old. But old belly dancers? Oh God, the images in my mind... I might be fine with the whole belly dancing concept if the dancers were at least  somewhat  attractive. I still wouldn't see the relevance to vintage cars, but hey. I think my favorite part was the ancient, scantily-clad woman balancing a sword on her head and prancing around with her arms raised. She looks around in challenge and the crowd applauses appeasingly. It was classic. People in Roseburg are desperate to prove how "cultured" they are, of course, so this crowd that's gathered around is acting so damn  interested ; all in an attempt to impress their neighbors with how impressed they are. And then there was the stuff leading directly into the look-alike contest. A local radio personality enjoying the power of holding a microphone, because then everybody has to listen to him. Unfortunately, and he's probably on the radio to avoid this, everybody is also  looking  at him. Anyway, he's giddy with his power and everything's fine: he's droning on, and I'm still too busy looking at him to listen to what he's saying. But then he has to let somebody else talk. This guy is completely unwilling to relinquish the microphone. I was reminded of Hillary Clinton finally having to leave the White House. He tries to hold the mic for this lady, but she snatches it away. His face contorts in suppressed rage, then his hand reaches out and grabs it back, he adds some superfluous comment that was supposed to be funny, and then the lady grabs it again. At one point, they were both clinging to the thing, like they were seriously fighting over it. I don't know why, but it was hilarious to me. As for the contest itself, there was one contestant. I was impressed, though: he did look like Rupert. I don't know what else he has going for him, but he definitely looks like Rupert. A shnark too thin, but oh well.
