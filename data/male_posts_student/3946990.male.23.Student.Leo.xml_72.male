Each emotion offers a distinctive readiness 2 act; each points us in a direction that has worked well 2 handle the recurrin challenges of human life.As these eternal situations where repeated  repeated over our evolutionary history, the survival of our emotional repetoire was attested 2 by it's becoming imprinted in our nerves, as innate automatic tendencies of our human heart.  4 a long  crucial period in human prehistory, fear had been a very essential emotion which made the difference between survival  death  mattered 4 the main task of evolution. The 1st laws of ethics(the 10 commandments, etc) can b read as attempts 2 harness, subdue  domesticate emotional life.  All emotions r, in essence, impulses 2 act, the instant plans 4 handling life that evolution has instilled in us.  In a very real sense, we have 2 minds... 1 that thinks  1 that feels  these 2 interact 2 form our mental life. This is what the folks so commonly call "Head"  "Heart."  Life is a comedy 4 those who think,  a tragedy 4 those who feel.  U don't need 2 know fully what something is 2 know that it is dangerous.  Feelings r typically insdispensable 4 rational decisions.They point us in the proper direction, where dry logic can then b of best use. While the world often confronts us with a wide array of choices(How should u invest ur retirement savings? Whom should u marry?), the emotional learning that life has given us(such as the memory of a disastrous investment, or a painful break-up) sends signals that streamline the decision by eliminating some options  highlighting others @ the outset. In this way, neurologists  psychoanalysts argue that the emotional brain(limbic system) is as involved in reasoning as is the thinking brain(neocortex). The emotions then matter 4 rationality.  It is not that we want 2 do away with emotions  put reasonin in it's place, but rather 2 find the intelligent balance of the 2. We need 2 harmonize head  heart.  Reframing a situation more positively is one of the most potent ways 2 put anger 2 rest.  A universal trigger 4 anger is the sense of being endangered. Endangerment can be signalled not just by an outright physical threat, but also, as is more often the case, by a symbollic threat 2 self-esteem or dignity.  Distraction is a highly powerful mood-altering device(mostly anger) 4 a simple reason; It's hard 2 stay angry when we r havin a good time. The trick of course is 2 get anger 2 cool 2 the point where someone can have a good time in the 1st place.  It is the combination of reasonable talent  the ability 2 keep going in the face of defeat that leads 2 success. 4 a given level of intelligence, ur actual achievement is a fxn not just of talent, but also of ur capacity 2 stand defeat.
