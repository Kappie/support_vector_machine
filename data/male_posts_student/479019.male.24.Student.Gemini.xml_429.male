Afterwards I decided to watch  Bottle Rocket  instead of going to the Belmar. That didn't mean I didn't have some beer. Well I have beer every night...  Anyway  Bottle Rocket , I liked it better than  Royal Tennenbaums  and  Rushmore ... despite Bill Murray not being in it. The characters weren't as interesting, but the story was more amusing.   Yea... I woke up late again today. It's really the weather! I'm just itching for warmer and sunnier days to appear. This weekend I hope to get some writing done.  Tonight I'm going to a TASC banquet. That should be good... for the food anyway.  **
