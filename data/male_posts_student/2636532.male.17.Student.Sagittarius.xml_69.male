I AM SOOOOO BORED! I haven’t been doing much but sitting around doing nothing. I am almost done my stay in Poland, been here way too long. I just found out that my uncle has a computer so I decided to come on here and type an email. When I go to my other uncle’s house then I can send and the email! Thank goodness they have disks. I’ve only got the chance to check my email I think twice since I came and even then it was only for a second because their internet doesn’t stay connected for too long and it’s really expensive apparently. So to those few that actually sent me an email thanks! I read a couple sentences of each before I got booted off so my mom could check her email. She spent almost double the time on that I did! Imagine that, a parent being a hypocrite.  Today I was sitting around bored and my uncle told me to follow him into a part of the house I didn’t even know existed and there was a computer! I had to spend about an hour hooking things up and finding the mouse and keyboard since they had it all put away so I wasn’t too happy about that, but hey a computer is a computer.  I wonder how long I can make this email before half of you stop reading out of boredom. Well I know its still summer and most of you are doing nothing since otherwise you wouldn’t have even opened this email and would be out somewhere with people, but you have chosen to read it this far and so I think I know which couple of you will be the only ones to not read this whole thing.  It’s been sooooo long since I said much in English. Well yesterday I did have to phone my brothers about my courses and all that and then my mom started to get mad since we had been on the phone for almost an hour. It’s not my fault that I needed to talk! Then I had to call Keren quick and my mom got mad over that too. I mean geez it was only a second. I haven’t said much in English here unless it’s been mumbled under my breath at someone, but I can’t even do that or they all look at me wondering and asking me what I’m saying. Nobody speaks it here. My mom even refuses to speak English to me under principle that since I’m here I have to learn how to speak in Polish. I have become a mute. I can understand almost everything they say to me so I don’t understand why they can’t at least learn some English and go half way like me. I refuse to speak Polish (even though I could) for several reasons. One is because I have a horrible accent and the other is because whenever I say anything whatsoever in Polish all they do is start to coo and act all surprised that I can say anything, then it become a huge topic of discussion for them and they forget even what I said to begin with, so they make me repeat it over and over to make sure they heard me. I feel like a baby, they get all excited over everything I say. Plus I have only 3 more days here before I head off to Paris ^_^ So it doesn’t really matter if I learn or not. There I’ll be able to speak French at least and then my mom will be the one suffering, hey what goes around comes around. XP My mom commented to me yesterday as to why I hadn’t really bonded with more then just about one of my cousins. I pointed out to her that just because we are family doesn’t mean I have to get along with any of them or even like them. She got all shocked and mad that I would say such horrible things about my own blood as she says, but I told her it was true. How can you bond with people you have only known for about 2 weeks and that don’t even speak the same language as you? Plus a couple of them annoy me. One is about 12 and just giggles, smiles and stares at me the whole time. For the first minute it was cute, but it’s not when it doesn’t stop! Then she started picking out random things for me to translate for her. Like she would say “lody” and I would say “ice cream”. After that it would be “wolne” and I would say “slow”. After that she would get me to say bike (which no matter what I say, she repeats beaké) also words like book, boyfriend, cards and car. So after those couple words all she does is repeat them over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over… and then sit giggling while she asks me to say it again for her. After I repeat it all she would do is say it again and again while giggling like crazy. She then started to follow me around asking to go on a beaké ride or play cards every two seconds. Also every day she would come to see what I am wearing and then would go home to change and match me. She even managed to find a necklace almost identical to the flower one I wear all the time. Then my mom wonders why me and all my other cousins find her annoying as hell.  It’s really amusing how here my mom has to yell at me in English instead of Polish like she usually does at home, so here if I get her mad then she forgets to speak in Polish for a while and I can have a conversation with her in English. Not like I do that purposely or anything…. Really… that would just be very evil and I’m not like that. ^_~ Did you know that in Polish, Minesweeper is Saper? Didn’t think so, not very interesting, but I’m bored and am just trying to see which programs I recognize on here. I have the high scores on all 3 of the levels! Wooooo I am so bored… I’ve been dragged to see about everyone here that my mom used to know. She has more family and friends here then I care to even know about. All I do is stand and say hi and then they all give kisses and hugs and then leave me to sit with my tea as they talk for hours. I’m like the puppy my mom brings everywhere just to show people that she has me then she forgets that I’m bored to death and would rather be doing anything else then listen to her talk to someone I have never even heard of before. The thing I hate the most out of these visits is that whenever you go to see someone they all give you hugs and kisses on the cheeks no matter who it is that you are meeting. It’s a hug and 3 kisses, some people even try to kiss you on the lips, but I’d rather not be kissing old men and ladies like that. I’m forced to do it too again before I leave. You get so much lipstick on your cheeks at the end of the day that just won’t come off. Old ladies wear the ugliest shades that stick to your skin forever.  Tomorrow apparently we are going to visit another of my mom’s “bestest” of best friends from 25 years ago. She is making me come along because this chick has a daughter my age and according to my mom, she is fluent in English. I find that highly doubtful since everyone here that has taken English classes can only say a couple words and then they are done with all they know.  Yesterday we came back from a 2 day visit to Krakow and some other places. We left on Thursday around 6 am and then got to Auschwitz at about 2 pm to go tour around there. Auschwitz was one of the biggest death camps during WWII and so my mom wanted to show me that. It was pretty interesting, but very much depressing to look at all the belongings of people that were murdered in the gas chambers. Also they showed us all the cells where people slept and bathed, plus the hair of women that was kept to make blankets and all sorts of other things. After 3 hours of that it was another 3 driving back to Krakow where we were staying at my aunt’s cousin’s grandparents’ house. Then the next day we woke up early and went to some Salt Mine. It was all really brown salt figures, nothing like the nice shiny walls that you would imagine. Kind of very much boring and not worth getting up early for to walk for hours with some tour guide that didn’t really seem like she was enjoying it. After that we had to go into Krakow which is some really really really old city in Poland that used to be the capitol at one time so we could go visit some plain summer houses of old kings I had never heard of. I really wasn’t too happy after that and annoyed my mom by taking pictures of her every second that I got. She asked me to take pictures so I did! Wasn’t my fault it was just to annoy her and now she has a billion ugly pictures of her not doing much but say running away from me. Then we drove for the rest of the day home in the blazing heat (nobody seems to realize the value of an air conditioner here). We finally got home about 8 hours later. I don’t see how it really should take that long other then the fact that they have such crappy roads here and none at all are ever going directly to where you want to go. They all seem to veer off about 500 km from your final destination. Plus its hell when you get stuck behind some truck and can’t pass because all there roads have only one lane and curvy. You feel like a sardine in there cars because they are sooo small and cramped. A bike could probably split these things in half if the two collided.  Hmmmmm… what else have I done here? I have no idea. Well I sat around for 2 days doing nothing really at all. Oh! I finished LotR finally! (People who haven’t finished the series and don’t want to know what happens skip the next part, spoilers!) I haven’t read at all since Japan and so coming here and doing nothing was a real motivator. I even read most of the appendixes, I’m saving 2 of them for the plane to Paris otherwise I’m screwed with nothing to do on the way. I remember that I was stuck bored in the middle of the second book so I finished that and went on to the third. I think that one was the best book since things actually happened! They weren’t just sitting around and dreading having to finally finish the whole quest. Maybe it was just that I don’t really remember the other books since it’s been a while, but still the fighting is always the best part.  Frodo is such a whiner. (Yes I know so am I too… shut up) I really have no idea why he is the main one since he really doesn’t do much but complain. I didn’t actually see why Shanny liked Sam so much until the end. Although I still don’t see how she thinks he’s attractive, he may be a cool character… just not really good looking. I mean Sam could have finished the whole thing on his own and would have been fine. Sam acts like too much of a puppy most of the time, but in the end he is one of the best characters because you know that he could have actually succeeded in getting rid of the ring, unlike Frodo who we all knew was doomed and weak enough to succumb to the ring’s power. At least Frodo was smart enough not to kill Sméagol; otherwise it all would have been pointless. Though I think Tolkien just had to make it that way or the end wouldn’t have worked out… so really Frodo is just dumb and shouldn’t have been in the story. Sorry to those who actually like him, I’m just ranting so don’t mind me.  The only thing I didn’t like at all about the third book is that there wasn’t much of Gimli and Legolas! Gimli is just such a softy really that’s what makes him adorable since he is a dwarf and supposed to be this really tough macho type creature. Legolas is by far the best since first off he is an elf and that is enough on its own (hey that’s why Arwen is up there in my books, well that and she’s married to Aragorn, who is the sexiest ranger. Oh but I don’t much care for Galadriel, no idea why, but she just bugs me) and also Legolas is played by none other then Orlando Bloom! What more would you ask for?! Hey that’s why Pirates of the Caribbean was good; I didn’t really pay attention to much else there. Ok so Johnny Depp was good in that too, but Bloom was better by principal.  There is this really cool French song that they keep playing but I have no idea who it’s by or what the name is… but I get the beat stuck in my head all day. Just the beat since I’m too lazy to actually listen to the words. The music video for it was really odd, she was in a glass box and sometimes it was raining and other times she was just singing in the box moving around. It’s on now and now I know I’ll get it stuck in my head all night.  Oh well back to complaining about LotR! Well not complaining so much as randomly saying stuff about it. Actually I lost my whole train of thought when I stopped to listen to that song and now I have no idea what the heck I was going to say. I was sad when Gandalf left. He shouldn’t have left middle earth! He wasn’t going to be there ever again if any of the other hobbits needed him. It was good though when Sam got to be the mayor for so long, I think that was in the appendix and not the book. Sam is pretty good at picking names for his kids. But holy cow, 13 kids! What other hobbit has 13 kids!? That is a bit too much. Merry and Pippin had to be the 2 cutest things in the whole story. Though I’m pretty sure out of everyone, they had the most fun and still managed to do great things. I feel bad for Pippin since he caused lots of trouble and didn’t exactly do as much as Merry did to save the world, but still he did have the best of adventures.  I wrote about a page about LotR already so I think I’ll finish it up since that is way too much already. Oh but I just have to say that actually what made the book good was that in the end they said what happened to everyone in the whole company and also that whole saving the Shire chapter was cool. Four hobbits to the rescue!  Um well… I’m bored, so I’m going to see what people are up to here.  Argh, it is now Monday morning around 1 am, last time I wrote was sometime Saturday morning I think. My uncle that has internet decided to go away for the weekend so I hope that I will be able to send thing sometime after I go to sleep otherwise none of you will have the joy of reading this overly long pointless email about nothing in particular that most of you haven’t even bothered to read a week after you got it.  Yuck one of my cousins is now smoking in the room next to me. It’s a really disgusting habit that all of them here seem to have. My uncle just came up and told her that she’s an idiot for smoking, which I agree with, but didn’t make her stop since she’s 22 and he said she should be old enough not to be stupid like that. Some reason they all enjoy smoking here. The cousins that I hang around with all do. The only 2 that don’t are the little annoying one and this one chick that went away with her boyfriend for almost the whole time I have been here.  The first 3 days I was here all I did was cough since I wasn’t used to all this smoke. It was really bad for a while and they thought I was getting a cold, but I knew it was that stupid smoke. Thankfully I guess would be the word that I got used to it enough to be able to tolerate it because the day after I stopped coughing we went to a disco. All the clubs are full of smoke and I know if I wasn’t used to it I would have died. It was pretty fun. Three of my cousins took me and they brought along one of there cousins along. Polish people are all drunks, even if they are young I swear. The legal age for drinking here is 18 and they are all legal, but still they were telling me stories (well as much as I could understand) about when they were younger and drinking and then going out to clubs. Two of my cousins are twins, boy and a girl, they are both attached, but both managed to hook up with a couple people that night. I don’t think that the guy cousin remembered anything though since he was so out of it, but the next day his girlfriend of 5 years came over and was sort of pissed since she found out he had gone. I found that sort of amusing. All of them have boyfriends or girlfriends and they all have for about 2 years or more, it’s crazy. At the disco, the cousin that is closest to my age and I spend the most time with was a good boy and babysat me really the whole time, making sure that no scary Polish guys came and attacked me. I was happy to see that at least one of them could remain faithful, but it could have been also that he didn’t drink since he was stuck driving us. We left an hour before closing at about 5 am. The oddest thing that happened was that at about 1 am a stripper came out. Her name was Karolina, same name as my neighbor, only those who have ever seen or heard stories about my neighbor will know why I laughed when I found that out. Don’t ask me why there was a stripper. All I know was that the guys were slightly happier after and there was a longer line up for the washrooms. *shudder*   Wow I’m almost done my 4th page about nothing. I’m not even going to bother rereading all of that so you are stuck with all my spelling mistakes and whatnot so XP I only have one day left now in Poland and then Tuesday I am off to Paris! Woooo getting really excited for another 4 hour car ride and then I think 2 planes rides just because my mom is so great at booking flights that I can never have a direct flight anywhere.  Tomorrow shouldn’t be too bad, except I need to wake up earlier so I can go have coffee and meet one of my mom’s friends for some pointless reason. The only part I like is that we are going to Poznan and my mom feels bad about making me come along meeting all her unimportant friends so she is buying me off and I get to shop. Mwahahahaha! I’ve already bought some pretty cool things. I got these curly long earrings; some really funky long blue sock type things that I have no idea where I will wear since the color doesn’t go with anything I own, but they were cool so I got them; these whitish bluish pants that have pink lines on them; and then a couple shirts that I think are sweet. My mom said that she saw this ring that has a lily in the middle and this really funky 80’s type bracelet that has circles and squares both which she thinks I might like. Tomorrow I get to pick which one I want, I’m sort of undecided. It depends on my mood I guess. Plus I really need to find an English book of some sort since I finished all 4 that I brought after a week of being here. That probably is why this email is as long as it is already. If I had something better to do then I would be doing that instead.  I’m actually very happy at the moment since I just realized that I might be able to actually have twins like I wanted when I’m older. Well at least there is a bigger possibility then I thought before. I know that I have a set of twin cousins and my mom has two set of twin cousins both on either side of her family. Plus my grandpa had twin brothers. My dad never talks about his family so I have no idea what is going on there. All I know is that my mom really wanted twins and was sad that she never had any. All I need now is to marry a guy that has twins in his family and I’m set! ;) Actually it really doesn’t matter if that happens or not, I just think it would be easier to have twins so then you have 2 kids over and done with right away. Yes, me being incredibly lazy has something to do with this idea. I did get to speak some English today though! That just added to my happiness. That chick that my mom made me see whose daughter knew English actually did speak English! We talked for about 4 hours and then I had to leave. It was fun since I hadn’t got to speak that much in a while and she also had stuff to say since she never gets to practice. She’s pretty cute and I was really surprised when she told me she was 18 since she looks so much younger. Not that I even look 17, but still she looked as if she had just turned 16 just a while ago. According to my mom, she might be coming next summer for 3 weeks with her mom. I have no idea how that’s going to work out since even though she supposed to be coming in July, I most likely will be really busy since I’m planning to go somewhere hopefully, moving or road trip or even vacationing somewhere interesting.  I’m dreading this last year of high school. It has all been way too long and useless already. I hope that this year won’t be too much work. I have enough to think about as it is. I still need to figure out what the heck I’m going to write for my essay to get into that program I want. It has to be really good otherwise I won’t make it and then I’m stuck since the only plan I have after is trying to get into UBC or maybe still go out east, who knows. I still have no idea where I will go if I don’t make it right away. I haven’t even fully decided what I’m going to take in University either. This is way too much stuff to have to think about right now. Even though I should be since I have the time at the moment. One night I was sitting around and for some reason was feeling really creative and then I thought up my prom dress. I have it all sketched out, it’s really cute. I hope I can find the stuff I need for it. All I can say is that obviously it will have some blue on it, since that’s all I wear, but *gasp* it will be white too! Wow I’m actually going to have other colors, even though white isn’t considered a color, but it’s more of a shade. Whatever it’s still different. My grad blurb came to me too. In about 5 minutes I wrote it out. Its basically finished just I’m not sure how long I’m allowed to make it so I know some of it might have to be reworded. So Keren please tell me how many characters I’m allowed to have. I’m really happy that I at least have those 2 things for the most part covered because I was really worried that I would get neither done and then end up having said something stupid in the yearbook and spend lots of time thinking up a dress for prom.  Heehee, my mom just called me stuck up. She said I gave her my look and so that makes me stuck up. It’s not my fault that when she says something stupid I make it known to her. I laughed since I told her that I only do it when that person is annoying me and she didn’t get it for a while. Then she got mad at me for being all bitchy. Its 2 am, I’m allowed to be bitchy. Everyone here is up still and all of courses drinking as much as humanly possible, so there is no way I will be able to fall asleep with all this noise now.  I think that’s all for today. Well now it’s Monday and about 7:30 pm. Tomorrow I get to wake up at 4 and leave for Berlin! Woo aren’t we all excited. Well actually I had a pretty good day. We went into Poznan, the big city 15 minutes away and I got to walk around it for hours while my mom had coffee with girl friends. I went to some book store and bought English and French books. The French one was pretty cheap so that’s why I bought it. All the English books there were so incredibly expensive. Well only because I barely had any money to spend. My mom got me the lily ring! Actually when I came back from buying the books she gave it to me. I didn’t even get to pick, but it’s a cute ring so I’m not complaining. It looks a bit like Keren’s ring now that I think of it. I hope she doesn’t get mad. My mom picked it not me!  I miss everyone and hope that all is well. Someone please email me! I actually can’t believe how much I’ve written. My mom was thinking that I had started writing a book since I have been at the computer so much in the last little while. That would be a neat idea though; on vacation and writing a book. That would be fun to be in Paris writing just so I could tell people that I wrote my book in Paris! But knowing me I wouldn’t finish and all I would end up with is random ideas spread up on a couple hundred pages that really aren’t linked together whatsoever expect maybe that they are all written in my poor handwriting and have no real point at all. Writing a book for me would mean that I actually have to focus on one main plot and what’s the fun in that? If I get the inspiration then I will, for now I’ll stick to overly long emails.  I think I might be done. Six pages is even a bit too much for me. Plus I actually want to spend time with people before I leave. In fact, it will be sad to leave since the most important person for me here is my grandpa and somehow I doubt I will ever see him again. He used to come and visit, but then he got too old to make the trip. I know that I won’t be coming back here any time in the near future. Another ten years at least, so I have a gut feeling that he wont stick around until next time.  Anyway, miss all of you!  Have fun without me. But not too much fun :P   P.S. Ori I know you are at work and bored out of your mind, that’s why I’m sending this to that address, but if you can, can you please send this to Shanny too? I didn’t ever add her new email address into my contacts so I don’t have it and I really wanted to ask her what Duo said exactly since I’m pretty sure she will remember word for word. I had to leave quickly that one day I saw her and didn’t get a chance after to ask. So please email this to her since I want a full description! Plus wooo I have all 3 now XP *gloats* ps2, gamecube and xbox. I love my brothers for there lack of saving money skills. My brother told me that Shannon looked jealous when he was buying it in EB since she commented that now we have all 3. mwahahahahah. Gamecube still is the best no matter what.    and there you have the load of crap I wrote   - Dark Lily 0>--}---
