     
      So I have a big fucking interview tomorrow for my new school. I am also scared of talking to people that I don't know, including girls. So that's going to put me in a bad spot.  And I wonder what questions that they'll ask. It's probably something like:  -Why did you apply to IPHS? -From your first view, what seperates IPHS from any other school? -Will you be using the CSU Pomona library often?  Any help if you can?
