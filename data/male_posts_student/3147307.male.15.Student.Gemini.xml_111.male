Josh M had a great introduction to films in that some Chirstians are culturally anorexic (avoid culture) or cultarally gluttons (don't stop to think about culture). We need to find a good balance. After the movie, we had a good discussion about the character contrasts between Abraham and Liddell. Fun stuff! "I believe God made me for a purpose. He also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure." Eric Liddell in the Chariots of Fire.
