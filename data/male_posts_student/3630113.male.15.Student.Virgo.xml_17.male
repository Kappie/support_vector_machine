"CNN News: Terrorist attack in Portugal. 203 deaths so far and hundreds more injured. Portugal soccer team caught in attack. Unconfirmed reports say coach Scolari killed in attack.

Caught spiderman today..woah..cinema was quite packed..lotsa teenagers watching..esp after the end of the jc exams or sth like that...the movie was pretty good...almost living up to expectations..but i think further improvisation can be made...pretty good plot and action and stuff...but kirsten dunst doesn't look as good as she did in the first instalment...=p didn't quite like the ending though..even though there were plenty of quotable quotes in the movie...skip this part if u haven't watched the movie and planning to do so..  May Parker: I believe there's a hero in all of us. Gives us strength, makes us noble. Even though sometimes, we have to give up the thing we want the most.   Spider-Man: [realizes he may have recovered his super-powers] I'm back! I'm back!  Spider-Man: [falls down on a car, moans] My back. My back...
