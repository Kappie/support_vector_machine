After the show of the markets and coming as it is the first budget of Manmohan Singh as PM, this proposal to tax the transactions will have an adverse impact on the Stock brokers. The margins for these short term transactions are wafer thin and the .15% tax on it would wipe out even that. Though there are some who dismiss this theory, there is no solid proof of this theory being completely wrong. The mere fact that there are leaders in the ruling coalition who wished markets to hell would not make this thoery redundant.
