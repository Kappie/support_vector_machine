Not that his omniscient self doesn't know what he's reading before he "sees" (with his entirely intangible being) the word, but he might, like, focus on it and just laugh. Then again, how would an intangible being do something like laugh? Isn't laughter something that is by definition a certain physical expression of a certain emotion? Maybe Jesus laughs (as opposed to the father or the holy spirit) o.O, but that's only plausible if you believe in that whole holy trinity thing. Even if he couldn't express his "feelings", that doesn't necessarily mean that he can't be aware of it. I confused myself and forgot my point... again. Fuck.  That is all. -- Feanor
