Just me drunk and feeling sorry for myself because all my shit was up..  some people get in fights I sit down and write and it just so happens the world has a window to my feelings..  I guess thats all I can say about that...  Peace out kids..  In closing here's a little nascar philosophy, because as you know all great philosophers were nascar fans..  "Some days you're the bug. Some days you're the windshield"
