We were doing a science fiction section in english and we had to write a comparison essay between the moves "Bicentennial Man" and "A.I.".  Oh yeah, I got 82% or something on that essay, in case you're wondering. 	Sorry about the quality of this first drawing, I'm having a bit of a time making the swtich from lined paper to frames.
