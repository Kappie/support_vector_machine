At Alma they spoke of the enevitability of doubt, and in my recent reading,  God and the Philosophers , every philosopher so far has dropped away from the faith during their upper high school/college years. Am I doomed to follow this path of denial then reacceptance? I hope not. I'm also beginning to see a bunch of other similarities between the testimonies of these philosophers and my current life. Perhaps I will study philosophy...  Don't bother reading the rest of this. You've been warned,  I have decided that English is a inherently flawed system of dicussion and must be destroyed. Leave nothing to infect the other langauges. This recent uprising of anti-English hatred is brought to you by my recent influx of grammar rules in Am/Lit 11. Most specifically rules #2 and #10.  Rule #2: A verb in a dependent clause agrees with the subject of the clause; in other words, with the phrase "one of these," the verb that follows will be plural. E.G. Alice is one of those students who always receive an "A".  The first flaw is the ambiguity of were the clauses truly begin and end.   Alice is (one of those students who always receive an "A".)  Alice is one (of those students) (who always receive an "A").  Alice is (one of those students) (who always receive an "A").  I suppose the first example can easily be thrown out. But I personally believe the 3rd makes more sense than the 2nd. Wait...Wait...Dang it! This begins to freekin' make sense! Why? Why does English torture me so? Argument retracted.  Rule #10: A singular and a plural subject joined by "or" or "nor" take a verb that agrees with the nearer subject. E.G. Either the judge or the lawyers are wrong.  This can be defeated mathematically. As judge is singular it therefore must be 1 judge. As lawyers is plural, they therefore must be a group greater than or equal to 2, so let us assume the lowest possibility and say there are two lawyers. Since there is no indication of extraneous variables affecting outcome, we can also assume that probablity will be exact... Damn this is boring. Argument retracted.
