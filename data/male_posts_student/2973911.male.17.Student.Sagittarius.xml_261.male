Either way, it has the same ritualistic purpose, except sexual fetishes are usually limited to, well, sex rituals.  Anyway, it isn't the type of fetish that anyone probably uses to harbor real cash, because that would be so powerful that it may be more important than any other anting-antings found in Banahaw or whereever.  It usually has a greenish color, signifying nature, moss, or rot which adds to its exotic look.  These green things ARE NOT used for sex practices and may not be used for it in anyway for it would be... detrimental.  Anyway, DO NOT buy sexual fetishes found in urban areas.  A person who requires mystical assistance to get his thing up would probably need to try Obando or somewhere in a rural area.  As for rural fetishes not used for sex rituals, you may find those at these places: Siquijor, Banahaw, Quiapo, Cebu, an other notorius places.  You may also find some in Quezon city but unfortunately, you won't find anything useful because the spirits found inside these materials are already killed by air pollution -- I can't be sure if those sold in Quiapo are any better.  Anyway, for better understanding of these fetishes, you may subscribe to your local Shaman and you may also participate in fora concerning anything that can be utilized magically and can miraculously cure mortality as if it is better than God.      After all these shenanigans, there is no requirement for these.  All I need to say is, whatever fetish is to you is my definition of fetish, for I have no reason to believe in magic anyway.
