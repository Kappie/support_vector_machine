She never really left the list, but I was wary about adding her in midst of the conflict. This person is ***TANYA Z THOMSON***. She has proven time and time again that she is trustworthy and is a good person. And of course, Michael is on the list of people who are going to burn for their lies. And Tanya, I am sorry that you had to be in the middle of all this. I am sorry for the things I said, and I am sorry for hurting you.
