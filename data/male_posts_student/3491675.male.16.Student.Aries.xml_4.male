Anyway i need to find a creative outlet for all the sexual energy i have, drawing just won't cut it anymore i need to pursue more time consuming and energy consuming activities, which will most likely include short stories, some type of creative creations. ANyway besides that nothings new with me just same old same old stuff school. oh yeah ive talked to alyssa like some two hrs ago, it's been ages since i talked to her well ever since i left my previous/ former lovely school *obese tears* god i miss those day's, they seem like memories from like a long, long time ago. hey got to go im getting kinda hungry (not in that sexual way, but in the starving way) well better go make myself some food.
