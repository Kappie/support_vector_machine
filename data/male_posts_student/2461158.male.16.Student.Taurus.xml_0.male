Saturday Uncle Randy took Gael and I up in his plane and even let us fl it a bit, that was great. When we got home in the afternoon we got to ride the horse, Foxy. Aunt Marla got Isaac all dressed up in cowboy clothes and he was riding around all over the place it was great. Sunday we had a nice worship service and just rested, until the evening when we watched a movie. Today Uncle Randy took Papa, Gaelan and I to the Indianapolis 500 Speedway. It has a museum in the infield, which was pretty cool. We got lots of cool pictures that'll I'll have to put up on my website. We also went to a big war monument and got some cool pictures of that too. While we did that Isaac and Shayna went with mama and aunt Marla to a childrens museum. This evening aunt Marla made us sit in the living room while she prepared a suprise. Well she had set the table with weird stuff for us to eat with. Like I got a big bowl for a plate, a pale for a cup, a straw for a fork that kinda stuff. It was hilarious, we all had to wear bibs and we got some weird stuff. Shayna got a baby bottle to drink with, ect. We got pictures so don't worry I'll put those pictures up too. Well I'm gonna go spend some time with the fam. So happy holidays from Steven in Indiana!
