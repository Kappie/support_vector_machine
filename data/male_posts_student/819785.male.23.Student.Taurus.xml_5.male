I'm moderately drunk, still tipsy, but god the cheap vodka fruit drinks from Asda are class (Â£1.28 for 700ml :D)!  I feel the need to do odd things, but there's nobody here but me, so I'll probably just go to bed, once I'm sure I've gotten past the hangover stage. Not the first time I've done that, stayed awake until I'm completely sober just so I don't wake up with a bad head. Doesn't always work though. For more interesting experiments in drunkenness, just wait until I can get into the proper student lifestyle.....  Night all!
