So thats kinda interesting.  Anyway I got lost in it, but found my way out.  Ok, that part of my dream was lame, but it gets weirder.  Suddenly I'm on an airplane, right?  And I have this little.... dealie in my hand that when I push the button, its little helicopter blades make me float.  I also have a little yammucha.   Yes, thats right, a yammucha, the little Jewish hats. Don't ask me why, I do NOT know.  Anyway, I get a knife because I have to go to the rear of the airplane and slice open this IV Pump looking thing... for no reason.  The hard part is that the rear of the airplane is open.  And for some reason I only fall out when I get near it.  So after I get bored of looking where I'm supposed to hack away at this pump, I get sucked out of the plane.  I'm falling 55,000 feet.  So suddenly, I use my little helicopter thing in hopes I can safely land.  Well, I fall anyway.  All of the sudden, before I crash into the earth, I hit 'Esc' and quick load my game (??) and I'm back on the plane.  Well I fall out and load again, so now I'm scared shitless since I've fallen like 3 or 4 times now and then I fall again and I wake up in a cold sweat.  Freaky, that never happens.  I should look up on hyperdictionary what all that means, its got a nice little dream dictionary.
