Been getting in about 12ish most nights so... sorry >_  Um, what's been going on in my world... well, Sixth form induction's ok, not a lot to talk about there apart from there are some really cute girls coming to Tommies next year, so that's good. Um, Return to the Forbidden Planet is weird because playing 2 guitars and a trombone (no, not all at once) is complicated. Can't think of much else.  Sorry that it's so short. I'm too tired to think of a lot.  Quote of the day: "He never ever learned to read or write so well, But he could play a trombone just like a-ringin' a bell."
