Pastor Keddie preached his first 2 sermons on Sunday as our pastor - and then today we got the Crown  Covenant Publications Magazine and about 15 books in there for sale were written by him - I didn't realize how much he writes! I've been straying from quotes of the day, but I am now going to have a quote (on the funny side), song (any that strikes my liking at the particular moment of writing a post), and Bible verse of my choosing (maybe from a QT or something like that) daily.  "I went to watch Farenheit 9/11 today and got stuck in line for four hours. No, it wasn't at the ticket booth, I was stuck behind Michael Moore at the concession stand." - David Letterman   urlLink Breaking the Habit  - Linkin Park  He who is a proud heart stirs up strife, but he who trusts in the LORD will be prospered. - Proverbs 28:25
