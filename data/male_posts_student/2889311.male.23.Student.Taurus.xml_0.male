I moved out from my earlier dwelling to live with Dilip when he came to UAB last fall. A year ago, I decided after a lot of deliberation that I should move in with Dilip. I was not too eager to move out for we 4 (prem, rajesh, rc and me) gelled pretty well. It was an eventful one years' stay in apt#6, it was eventful because I had done well in acads, I choose graphics as my field of interest, I learnt a lot from the gut-wrenching experiences I had during this tormenting period of graduate studies. I can confidently claim that I have become a better person in the churn of the last years' events.  Rajesh is moving to Virgina Tech for his phd and this coincided with my lease expiry in apt#6 and also two people sharing an apartment din't do any good to my wallet. So me and dilip decided to move back to my original place.  Yesterday, I spent the whole evening moving stuff and when I was shoveling stuff, I unearthed a lot of books, which I had collected during my college days and my early UAB days and also I came across a few of my reflections, which gave me a lot to ponder about. I got a feeling that I'am still lagging back now in terms of where I expected myself to be by then. I realised that I have broken a lot of promises that I swore that I will hold fast to by then. I came across exam answer books which reminded some pleasant and not so pleasant moments. I ran my eyes across few pages of my undergrad slam book, a few jottings were off base and they just hung there coz it was a slam book, while some others had given a lowdown on my undergrad life. I also gleaned a few articles that I had printed off from the web to read in the next few days.  Meanwhile a lot has changed in apt#17, the crowd that used to hang out there has slowly dispersed, bob moved out of Laurengayle, so did ratna. Prem had two new roommies in this period, After the influx of new faces last fall, the outlook of apt#17 changed from being dour to being bubbly and it invited some people's irate (got to do with the petty nature of the crowd I guess, but I got a more convincing rationale, which is reserved for some other post ). I had kept myself out of this all last year only to marginally brush with the inevitable sometime during the last fortnight. In retrospect of what happened I feel good that nothing took off. Coming back to the main point and to summarize, this place and the people have changed quite a bit.  I felt strange yesterday and today morning, while the place was so familiar I felt strangely disconnected. I'am sure dust will settle on these unsettling thoughts and I will back into my own soon. One thing I don't want to do is get back into the loop that I was in when I was here last year. Accounts of those morbid and unsettling days will be detailed in another post.  I will post the links for some of the pics that I took while we were moving sometime t'row.  Murali.
