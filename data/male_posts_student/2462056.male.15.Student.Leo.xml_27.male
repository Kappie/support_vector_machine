Me and Jesse went riding today.  We started at the skatepark, then we left his truck there and road off around town.  We went on campus, and to the coloseum and stuff, the normal places.  I came home around 4, listened to some music and played some bass, then started getting a headache, so  I laid down, fell asleep and woke up around 8:30.  Some shit is bothering me... but I'm not going to post that here, because I don't post stuff like that on here, hehe.  It's soooo boring here, there has been nothing going on this week at all.... it sucks!  It seems like no one is home... or at least I haven't been talking to many people, haha.  Oh well, yeah, so nothing is going on, I have a headache, and I'm bored as crap.  We can watch these two smilies make babies now...
