Which is a selfish breed of people, because they can't donate blood, but can recieve blood from any, and I mean  ANY  blood group. Which means, therefore, I have a higher chance of surviving when there is a need for blood  (touch wood! choi!!) . Just found that out in Bio today.  YaY! We are going to Pasir Ris Park on Wed.....to play, enjoy ourselves. I have been longing to rent roller blades. I want to learn how to skate....how meowfully fun. Weee!!! Can't wait too....so fun! I am so anticipating Wednesday.  Of course, besides Wednesday, I am very much anticipating Saturday. There's when Order of the Phoenix comes in, exactly at 7.01am! Weeeeee! I want to be the first one to grab the book! I want to be the first book buyer! Meow Meow! And possibly, the first Singaporean to purchase the book! Woah!   Gotta go play Dai Dee le. See ya tomorrow!
