On the game frequency I would play their songs so many times and eventually went to their site and heard other great synth-pop songs. I emailed them and they responded (I was so happy that day!) I still have that email copied to a word file. I continued to hear more of their music and downloaded some. (Sorry Freezepop…). I always want to buy their CDs but they’re hard to find. (They’re in an Indie Label) I’ll order them eventually  Here's A Picture Of Them!    urlLink      urlLink
