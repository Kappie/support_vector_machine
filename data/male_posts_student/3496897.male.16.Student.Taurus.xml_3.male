I've also been thinking of what I might use for a sig... wrote this a little while ago... hehe -  Whether I spend a lifetime with you in my arms... of If I die a lonely death... Know this... I'd give it all up... I'd die If I had too... just to see you smile... One more time... I Love you... and I always will... No Matter What...  Given the right music I might end up crying... lol... well Back to dreaming... and stargazing... = D
