Xbox connect is just a app that tunnels ANY system link game over the internet thus giving you the ability to play with friends from anywhere (US only) its simple and easy to use and best of all free. To use it just download it here (http://www.xbconnect.com/downloads/XBC4INST402.exe) next make sure you have a high speed internet connection DSL or cable and a highspeed network router (linksys,D-link so on) and plug on cord (patch cat 5 the big ole internet wire that looks like a phone jack but huge) into your PC and one into the back of your Xbox, now just boot up XBC (Xbox Connect) go into system link for any system link game on the xbox and join away or host, if you ever on look for host DannyJFarrar. That's about it and the above picture is a screen shot of what the app looks like notice you can organize by game, host, game type, and there is a buddy list. Enjoy and don't forget to download here http://www.xbconnect.com/downloads/XBC4INST402.exe  urlLink
