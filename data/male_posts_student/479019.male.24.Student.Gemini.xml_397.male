However, on the flipside that makes me feel really offended when I get attitude when I don't feel like I deserve it. Now... I can see where she's coming from, but it fucking feels like she's been taking a lot of things that I say wrong since January. I just made a comment on taking caring of oneself. I don't remember getting any attitude in the past for little comments made in passing before. I don't know if she realizes how fucking guilty I feel for dammaging our friendship in the past... and I've really worked hard to put emotions aside so that we can go back to being friends. I think that makes me a bit more offended.   Am I being sensitive? I dunno... maybe I am. I haven't exactly been a happy person as of late...   **
