       
      Day by day the hours go by slowly, Like a flower blooming in the sun, Slowly it opens up its pedals, waking to the birds beautiful song, The minutes seem like hours, and the hours seem like days, the days turn to months,  and the months wont dicipate, The calling of my voice, Will not reach your distant ear, and now I have no choice, I think you've dissapeared, Your like a ghost above my head, looking at my every move, but you cant do anything to help, erase these lonely words ive said, and now no longer are you here, to share my distant memories, of a lonely lover in his highest, whos lost his lover, and his highness.
