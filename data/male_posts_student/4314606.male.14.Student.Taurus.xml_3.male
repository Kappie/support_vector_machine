No, that is NOT what I tell people when I first meat them... Anyways, yeah, schools starting, and it blows! I have a few friends I met at the end of the year, but other than that, I'm gonna get killed...  No one really knows who I am... I'm some dude who got his brain fucked up (ask me, and I'll tell ya...) and now neither knows how to interact with people, or remember to do homework... I ended up in Summer school this year for failing English... And Science... and probly health, never learned bout that one... I'm teachin myself to play the guitar, and wrote a song mocking those depressing acoustic song, and I call it emo song... it would be that song on the alblum you'd wanna skip, but its kinda catchy... I'll make a post bout it later... Anyways, I take paypal... =)
