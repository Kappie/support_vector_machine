Well the beginning of the day was mostly uneventful as I spent most of the time transcribing my journal into blog-format. However from 10:00 AM till 3:00 AM the next day (7/14) my day was filled with birthday wishes, cakes, and of course food, food, and yes, more food (so much for losing wait in the Philippines!).  I learned in order to have a long life, you need to eat pancit which is important to me since I plan to be immortal. Also went to church on my b-day which I also found out is part of Filipino tradition. There wasn't many people in church which was ok (just myself as my guide had dropped me off and a few dozen other people so I took the time to pray and self-reflect and to conduct some pre-Pennance).  Well, suffice to say the night was filled with San Miguel and Red Horse as well as several different kinds of Pampangan appetizers. Every bar we went to (well, only 2 really), an amateur Filipino kareoke singer was present at one point or another which was cool. The first club was okay and reminded me of Asia SF (the tranvestite night club/show in SF) and the second was a bar called R located outside Clark Airbase (I liked this one more because the live bands were really good and because there was actual space to dance around, plus the female singers were really cute). ANYWAYS, was a great time, so what did I learn:  1) Comedy: Filipinos love to laugh (even if it's at my expense!).  2) Singing: Filipinos love to sing (even if it's really bad since for some being the center of attention makes up for it).
