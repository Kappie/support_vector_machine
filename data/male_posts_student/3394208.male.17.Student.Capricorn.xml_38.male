Whoa!  While I look around Figuring what makes good sound Comforting really isn't it? I sweep your feet off the ground And so you you dance dance dance not minding what's around Listen to my radical funky sound Baby my guitar's a gun  So I shoot you up with these funky rythms  while I shoot myself a tequila Whoa! Whoa!
