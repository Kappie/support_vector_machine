Two weeks of vacation can start to drain...the more people you know when you visit somewhere, the more time you spend out, wearing collared shirts and cologne and sitting on restaurant decks, talking the same conversations and watching the same people.  I'm not bitching about this...few things are more enjoyable than a meal and beer during a sunset when your company is a group of people you truly enjoy, much less a month of traveling and seeing people at their best.  You just can't do it every day...repetition ruins enjoyment.  12 days in a row, my sunsets were that.  Tonight was my night off.  I will enjoy tomorrow's sunset, sitting at Islands, eating a portabello sandwich and talking to Mike or Mark or Fish, grabbing ten games of pool after that, drinking a bit, joking a lot.    I travel a lot, mostly because I'm homeless.  Is San Diego my home?  Is Florida my home?  Is Arkansas my home?  People from those places would say each is.  But I am a Texas resident with shit in Texas storage.  But I don't plan to stay in Texas after I get the Masters, even though I enjoy a lot of the folks there.  When I graduate, I long to try something new...specifically coastal living (I lived 30 minutes inland in San Diego...important distinction, because when I was a kid it was more likely we'd go to Disneyland than the beach).  So I move around a lot.  I can live for a month out of a red adidas soccer bag, holding two pair pants, two pair shorts, four t-shirts, three collared shirts, a jacket, two pair socks, seven pair underwear, one pair shoes, and my sandals.  It's second nature to live out of a suitcase...so much that I spent my first month in Austin living out of my boxes, only taking stuff out when I used it.  By the time I was unpacked, I was fed up with my roommates and moved.    When you travel, you are at the discretion of the person you are with.  Most of this is no problem:  I'm more extroverted than not, so I'm cool with going out whenever and usually with whomever...I can adjust my sleep schedule to appease my housing coordinator...I only require a couch and a sheet or blanket (not both, I won't use both)...I can go a day without a shower and I won't smell bad (probably my greatest trait)...I get along with roommates and parents swimmingly (as long as I'm not trying to pick them up)...and when you need time off from playing housemaker, I'll entertain myself.  But to be a good houseguest, you can't take more time off.  To thank the person you're with is to go with them on every decision they make.  They're hungry at 10 am?  You're hungry too.  They want to stay out until 4.  What luck, you do too!  They want to visit Sarah Trotter and Nikki Pharr...no shit, those are the honeys you were hoping to see this trip!  Free time is at the discretion of your travel director.  Only when they need a nap or a study break or some sort of moment to themselves do you get your own time.  And you have to use it wisely.    I use it to write on my blog.  Usually poorly.  Dad and I went to La Jolla today, the ritzy side of ritzy San Diego coastline, home of one of the best theatre companies in America, Des McNauff's La Jolla Playhouse (too lazy to link...find it yourself if you're interested).  The shopping district is on a cliff overlooking the ocean, and since my dad's favorite decisions revolve around where to eat, I figured we'd eat somewhere where I'd get beach and he'd get drinks.  Our waitress was fairly plain, slight British accent, no one I would remember except that she was the fifth waitress in a row that I noticed had an incredible ass.  Last night at 150 Grand in Escondido, our waitress had soccer legs and g'donki'donk butt.  Two days before, at TGIF, another stellar ass in stellar black pants.  The one prior, from Macaroni Grill (chains are cheaper for the old folks, who watch their money when they don't have to... it keeps us rich ), had bodacious everything.  And the hostess there was a fine assed speciman too (and one of the 18 year olds from the pool, who now that the weather is cloudy, can only be found at Westfield's North County Faire Mall).  I was never big on asses...I dated a lot of cross-country runners through high school and college, so sexy for me was small ass, small boobs, and kenyan legs.  But now that I'm a little older, a little more cultured, and a little fatter, I can appriciate a fine ass.    San Diego's got some fine asses.  WOOT!  Two weddings at the park in La Jolla today as Dad and I walked along the beach (for people who think beach is a surely sunny proposition, San Diego's coast gets cloudy in the middle of may, and save four or five days, stays that way until July 4.  every year).  I wondered how they arranged the wedding out there...who rents out a public park?  There were no police or city officials, so it didn't seem like a permit proposition.  My dad wanted to sneak in and eat cake.  I think he just wanted to go in because his ex-wife used to do that kind of thing.  I've never crashed a wedding, though if I can get Louisiana's favorite young politican Dawson Taylor to agree to it, I will film him as he crashes a wedding.    Last time I worked to finish my blog, I rewarded myself with porn.  Tonight it's EverQuest and In-N-Out Burger.  A friend of mine from SoCal requires me to go each time I come into town...she always gets mad when I get it sans secret sauce, though.  I'm not big on the Thousand Island mystery delectable.   We're out of secret sauce!  Put some more Thousand Island out in the sun!   My dad lives 30-40 minutes from the coast.  Today was the first day he'd been since I last visited him.  My mom lives 20 minutes from the coast.  The last time she went was the last time I visited her.  I go to the coast as much as I can...I missed a trip in April with some friends because I had papers to finish, and I still hate myself for not getitng my priorities straight.  I will drive 12 hours for two hours at the beach.  If I lived out here, I'd be on the beach every day I could make it...and not making it would only happen if I worked a double shift or someone had died.  I don't know a damn person in North Carolina, but once my TIP job finishes up, I'm taking someone with me to Myrtle Beach for a few days for fun days and big old bags of dirty nights.  Interested?
