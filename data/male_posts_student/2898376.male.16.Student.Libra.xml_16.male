My quarrel is not with them, I think they did well, I couldn't have done better. Anyway, it turned out the problem was my modem had crashed. For no reason. I mean, I did everything I was meant to with it. It brought to mind these two quotes: 'If cars had kept up with technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon, and once a week exploded, killing everybody inside.' 'What kind of a world would it be if you got up, had breakfast, got dressed, did up your shoelaces the normal way, and they refused to work? If your shoelaces just wouldn't tie up?'
