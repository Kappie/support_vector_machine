While he's not anyone that should have lead a country or gassed his own people, I couldn't agree more than that the US President is the real criminal here: leading us to war under false pretenses.  I just heard a funny and cruel joke: When Mary Kate Olsen was reading a newspaper article about her finally being 18 she said "Damnit!  Who told this reporter I lost another pound??"  Ouch.  Anyway, Tuesday night after the gym, Laura and Cindy came over and we hung out, munched on food and stayed up way too late.  Laura left, Cindy didn't, so Cindy and I hung out and burned workout CDs and watched late night TV until 1am.  Wednesday was a really busy day for me.  I think 3 different people asked if I was cranky.  I don't get cranky!  I just get busy and distracted.  Full staff meeting at 9am, going back to my apartment with Janina at lunch to drop off goods she's donating to me, dentists appointment from 2:30 to 4:30 and then gym until 7.  Got home, picked up Cindy and we went to Walmart.  We meant to also go to BJs and a Pet Store to get rat food, but by the time we were done at Walmart, everything was closed.  We hung out for the rest of the night, ate biscuits, cereal and everything else in my apartment. :)  She left around 11:20.. woah!
