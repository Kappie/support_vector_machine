We have the geography one to do tomorrow afternoon, I'm glad we are getting the most boring ones out of the way first!  I've been eating healthly since monday morning and I feel a little better.  School's been alrite.  Now that the stressless holidays have faded back into hardcore education, headaches have been returning :(
