I can understand if they put practice on the schedule but they didn't.  They put "Walk-through"  From that you may suspect walking trough plays but what happend?  We get chewed for going half speed in a "Walk-through" practice.  Oh well.  So right now I'm just sitting around doing not much of anything and not wanting to go sit on a bus for almost 2 hours.  I think I'm going to go play some Xbox.
