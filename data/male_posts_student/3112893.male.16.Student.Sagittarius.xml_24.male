For some reason, I can't fall asleep before 3AM and even when I do, my sleep is disturbed by a phone call, a bad dream, my mom or sister, or bright morning light that shines onto my face through the blinds of (THE) bedroom window*. As a result, I am constantly tired, groggy, and slightly irritable. What makes this even odder is that I haven't taken any stimulants for over a month. Sigh.  On a happier note, since I think my past posts have mostly ended up negative notes, I think this one should be different. Work is becoming fun again. I bring my iPod, turn up the tunes, and just mask the day away. It's also nice how it's summer because the machine on which I work in an old disabled freezer that gets really hot when the light's left on so I usually end up sitting in the glow of the monitor. The room's about 9 feet by 5 feet with no windows (what kinda freezer do you know has windows?) and when I leave for the day at around 5 or 6, the sun is still out. It's nice for me to feel like the day hasn't been completely spent yet.  Anyway, I should probably get to doing what I have to do**.  That is all.         -- Feanor  * My mother, sister, and I share a one bedroom apartment that can't possibly be bigger than 500 sq. feet.  ** Neuro-imaging, building-websites, math, prep for the SATs in autumn, physics, and chemistry (prioritized first to last from most important to least important).
