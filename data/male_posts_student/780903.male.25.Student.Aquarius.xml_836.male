John Kerry: Not Just Botox   Other plastic surgeries John Kerry has not had, besides Botox injections (OR: an excuse for me to find weird plastic surgery photos on the Internet and link to them, in the guise of topical political humor):   Listed in rough sequence from strange to stranger   1.  urlLink Chin Implants  2.  urlLink Otoplasty (ear pinning)  3.  urlLink Scalp Lift  (that sounds barbaric, doesn't it?) 4.  urlLink Buttock Implants  (disturbing photos) 5.  urlLink Calf Enlargement  6.  urlLink Male Pectoral Implants    I was going to post 10, but I was starting to get nauseous looking at these photos.
