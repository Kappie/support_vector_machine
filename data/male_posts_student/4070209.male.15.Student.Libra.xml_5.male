Last 2 weeks ago we had our exams nothing special........On that week that Saturday my friends and I went out....We went to Robinson's Galleria the "mall of my mom"..... I called it that because my mom works for Robinson's now she is very happy in her job because she is the head of the Big R somthin somthin......... Then last week we just had our regular classes...The teachers gave us back the exam papers and I found out that I don't Have failing.......On that same week out soooo called Latin teacher is disappointed at our scores in our Exams and Ut's so that's why he has given us another chance to pass Latin....We need to come up with a play consisting of what we learned in the first quarter that's why i went out last Friday to do that...we went to my friends house to prepare a script for our performance.....And we did half of it... Aftet that again we went to my mom's mall to eat dinner and i was picked up there around 8 30....Then the next day it was Saturday we needed to go to my friends house agian to finish the script and we did it....Then we decided just to play basketball for fun and when we were at the court we were invited to play against a few people who lived there in the village... It was a tight game for us the score was about 9-9 but suddenly we were all tired and we dont subtitution players to accomodate the 5 players so in the end we were defeated the score was 24 -15 were defeated by 9 points only 9 points....... The players were ME as the point guard, Miggy the Small forward, Jef the shooting gaurd, Miko the power forward , And lance the center..... All most all of us scored with the help of team work....... I really think that in a team you need unity in order to win......That's what we did even though we were fatigue.........
