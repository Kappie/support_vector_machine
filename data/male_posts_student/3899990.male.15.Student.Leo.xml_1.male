Let's take it step by step shall we?  Monday: My flight was scheduled at around 1:00 PM.  So, I arrived at the airport at 10:30 AM to get my tickets, check in, etc.  Then, once we boarded the plane, there were some technical problems and we had been sitting at the gate for at least 20-30 minutes.  After we had been sitting at the gate for that period of time, we were deplaned (all the passengers had to leave the plane).  They expected it to be up and running by 4.  But then after we were deplaned, the totally CANCELLED our flight.  And boy, was the whole Arizona FBLA group mad.  After waiting and waiting at the airport, they finally scheduled us for another flight at 6 PM.  Because of all the crap we had to go through, they gave us some free meal vouchers at the airport (which is the least they could do).  We had to get our food, to-go, then take a bus to another Terminal.  Finally, once we arrived at the other terminal, we were scheduled on our flight and we actually left the gate.  But, here's another twist:  Right when we were starting to take off, there was a dust storm and rain so we had to wait another 20 minutes.  Lastly, we actually took off.  We arrived at the Denver International Airport at about 9:30 PM local time (Denver is 1 hour ahead).  Tuesday: We all went to Six Flags and it was really fun.  I went on a few rides but on the first one I was screaming my head off.  You should've seen me.  After a couple rides, I went on a water one and got all drenched.  It felt really good but the water was kinda dirty.  After a few hours of fun at Six Flags, we went back to the hotel, changed, and got ready for dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe.  Food was pretty good, fast, and we met some FBLA members from other states!  Wednesday:  Well, I was supposed to go River Rafting but if I didn't tell you, I'm not allowed to go (don't ask, LOL).  So, the whole AZ Delegation had to get up at 5:30 in the morning and board the buses at 6:00.  After they left, I just took a nice long nap (because I went to bed at about 2 AM the last night).  By the time it was 11:00 AM they already came back and I woke up, got some lunch and now I am here typing this lovely post.  For later today, the opening session starts (which means the actual FBLA Conference starts) and the opening session is about 3 hours long... watch me try to stay awake.  I hope I was able to entertain you with this lovely post!  And I'll update again in a couple days.  Hope you're having a great week!
