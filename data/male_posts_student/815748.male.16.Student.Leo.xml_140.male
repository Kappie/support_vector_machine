Dan Jung has yet to return the library book he borrowed on my card, which is now overdue.  I got a 67 on my math test, boo hoo.  I either aced or (noticeably) BSed my history test; either way I think I got a good grade on that, yay.  MCAS tomorrow, we'll see how that turns out.  I'm not sure which teacher I should get to assess me, but I'm leaning towards Mme DeRobert.  I was disappointed by the lack of comments since my first comment-available post.  According to Julia Kalow, people are just not used to the comment feature on blogs, so I should prompt them with a question.  So here it is:  Who should I get to do my teacher assessment? (PICK ONE)  a) Mme DeRobert  b) Ms. Heidlage  c) Mr. Stanley  d) Ms. Kranes  e) Ms. Srikanth  To comment, click on the "comments" link below, next to my name and the time.
