And I think -  just think, but I’m not sure  - that I’m glad that I’m weird, because it makes me different from everyone else in this world.   Let’s take for example, the military. I’m absolutely nuts about it. At age 9, I memorized all the names and codes for the bombs U.S. used on the Iraqis. At age 11, I managed to remember all the abbreviations and nicknames for fighter jets and bombers. At age 13, I embarked on a journey to know every single rank in the military, from Private to Field Marshal. At age 15, I moved back an era and went back to WWII to see how the Allied forces moved through Europe starting with D-Day itself. Why exactly did I do all this? I’m not sure myself. Even my personality is weird. I can be extremely quiet if I want to. If I'm not in the mood, I can be really, really quiet. When I'm tired, I look like a street thug - especially when I'm on the public bus. If I'm in good spirits, then all hell will break loose. I will do all sorts of funny things, even if I'm in the middle of a convention, or when everyone else is having a farewell for another friend. Let’s move on to computer games. Some years back, everyone else were getting engrossed in Counter Strike and Half-Life. Me? I found those two a bore, and entertained myself building cities in Sim City and managing my own football teams in CM. Talking about football, most other people watch football and enjoy it. I, on the other hand, loved to make it a point to remember every player - first team or reserve - and their positions. Now it makes me wonder, why in the world can’t I do this when it comes to things like History and Agama??! Lack of interest? Perhaps. Somehow I find it easier to remember Francesc Fabregas than Maharaja Lela and Operation Market Garden than Prophet Muhammad’s  hijrah . But that’s beside the point. The point here is that – I am weird. :-P Do I ever wonder what people might think of me? Yeah, I do. Sometime’s I’m afraid people might think I’m a freak. Maybe I am a freak. But I’m not really bothered. Am I going to stop doing these funny things? Probably not. So, why have I decided to write about this in my blog? Have no idea. See what I mean? I am  weird...
