Annoyingness~ Well at least I'm going to Wonderland later with Nima, Mark, and Vivo~ Yayness! ^^ We gotta wait for Vanessa at the entrance though, 'cos she's renewing her Wonderland Season Pass too. Blahness.   Aww, Vivo doesn't wanna go on the "scary rides". Blah, I'll either wait down there with her or go up with them. Blah. I'm sure Mark will either stay with her or go on the ride with her! ;) She won't be as scared with Mark beside her. Besides, you don't really get the nerve to go on the big rides until someone forces you like how Jae and BK forced me onto the ride. You don't really learn to appreciate them until you understand how fun and exciting it really is. ^^  Hee hee~ I'm so happy my mom thinks Nima's a good guy. She thinks that out of my ex's, Nima's probably one of the best ones. Iunno... he's tied with Wilfred. Haha... Too bad my mom doesn't know about "where" Wilfred has gone, otherwise he'd be at the wayyy bottom of her list and she'd get my dad to beat the crap outta him! Haha! So I guess this makes Nima #1... as he always was. ;) My mom didn't like Joel. She thought he was weird looking and too nice. Haha! Funnyness! >O  You know, Erica's actually good with Nima. She hated Wilfred, wasn't too cool with Joel, and hated my other ex's. Nima is the first guy she actually approved of. Haha! I don't think any guy is good enough for Erica. She likes Sam a lot though... Eric, I didn't like much. Joe, let's not even talk about him *shudderzZ*. Ali, flirtyness... but overall a good guy. Sam, he was okay at first but now I disapprove of him... what a butthole.   Haha! So basically, I think Ali's best for Erica. She loves Sam so much but I don't think he realizes what he's doing to her. He's so clueless and evil! Argh! I'd slap him if Erica let me near him. She'd know what I was doing it probably tackle me over before my hand even goes within a metre of his face. He's gonna get it from me one day. >:( He and I need to talk.  Ahhh! I wanna talk to Elbert! I seriously hope he'll visit from USA this summer! It was so much fun last last year! Sleepover at Delia's place, video games, waking him up in the middle of the night, going out to the beach to do fireworks, and ice-cream. Then we went to "yum cha" (dim sum) in the morning. Too bad I only got to see him for those few days. Blah, at least he called me before he left... *sighzZ* Good times. He was pretty sweet of a guy, writing a poem and crap, but he's NOT someone I'd consider... Just a good pal! ^^ I heard something about getting together with Cindy, breaking up with her, going for her sister, then I don't know what happened. Well whatever. Hope he's happy, 'cos I know I am with Nima~! Couldn't wish for someone better! ^^ I love Nima and he's the best guy ever! He's   perfect!    I wonder if Nima's awake yet. It's 10:18AM... Only 1 hour until we go to Wonderland. LmAozZ~! I'm so messed. Hey, Vivo finally blogged last night about Wonderland! Yayness!  Aww, Erica's having it pretty rough right now... I'll talk to her tonight at Bethel. I don't like seeing my best friend like this... I'd practically strangle Sam for doing this but Erica wouldn't let me touch a single hair on him! -O-" I guess Sam can't get any worse than Marcos... They're both... flirty... except Sam knows how to flirt and Marcos sucks at it. Only difference... and except that maybe Sam looks better than Marcos 'cos Marcos is scary-looking and Sam is like... innocent-looking, although he's not innocent.   Do you know who looks best though? Nima! Hee hee~ Hmm, I haven't updated my story lately... Blah... I'm just giving up on it. I'm not as good a writer as Rachel is at stories! Moca excels at song-writing and poems too! Haha! Coolness, eh? Oooh... "eh"! Haha! I AM CANADIAN! Roofles! Aha! Saying roofles reminds me of Chrissy. He hung up on Nima and I yesterday 'cos we were too "boring" for him. Weirdo. Haha! Chrissy's always bored. -O-" Weirdo.
