I had been a student for a year by now and loved to hate the place, coming from the overcrowded city of Madras,GCE was for me the vapid place filled with unintersting wannabe engineers. I was never gregarious which in addition to my inherent laziness in manner made people think that I was haughty. So when I entered the department of electrical engineering after dallying with a host of unnecessary courses for a year, I was without a friend.Yes, I knew a couple of andamanese guys and their cronies, but they were a divertissement at best. Thats when I met her,Sujatha was everything that I was not, she was always surrounded by people,she was immensely popular among guys,when I was almost infamous,'the haughty outsider.' She was all talk where I was reticent,well to put it in perspective I have to concede that, she was 'cool' and I was 'who does he think he is.'   She was in my batch of seven people who are forced to do some trite electronic experiment, not that it promotes team spirit or anything but due to lack of enough working zener diodes(man who cares?), And one good think about my team(oh yeah!!) was that we had a geek among us,she would do evrything and ask us to copy the readings, so I had enough room, time actually,to make my moves.Well as usual I started bragging about how boring the place is, and she was like "oh yeah", so thats how it began, a love story that started out of hate, how profound?  The story of our first date is an interesting one.After a few weeks of all those 'hate talk' and college gibberish, I suggested that we should hang out more,may be catch a movie or something ,she agreed that we could do it sometime. As soon as the class got over I ran to her and said may be we should do it tommorow, my reasons being weekends are boring and I am not going to my hometown.Out of great reluctance and great deal of 'lets not break his heart attitude' ,she said 'ok.' I was thrilled, but my happiness was short lived coz I came to know later that night that one of her friends had had an accident, and that she was in the hospital overnight, I thought, oops!! there it goes man, she wouldnt come. I didnt have her number or anything so I couldnt call her up too, so I turned up pretty late at our rendevouz point to check just in case if the gods have smiled on my smiten soul, but there she was standing in the sun,a bit flustered,she was wearing a grey cotton salwar which was sassy without being classy,it had an air of 'I didnt make an effort to dress' but she was beautiful nevertheless.After a round of apologies she told me that she had spent the night in the hospital with her friend and it wouldnt be appropriate  for her to be on a date.I offered to accompany her to the hospital, and yes that was my first date,in a hospital caffeteria. Well we went on a lot of dates thereafter we talked about movies, family,love,college,future.....everything but us.BY this time I had a few friends, thanks mainly to her, I was now sociable, and everyone had accorded us the status "in love", except that we hadnt spoken about it.Dates kept happening and suddenly we had exams and we had semester holidays and we went to our homes.Thats when I started to miss her awfully, that when i realised I cudnt do without her, not now,not ever. When we came back to school she was very different, she was very cold, she was normal when we were amongst friends but she tried not being alone with me.I just couldnt stand it, so I asked her to come out with me on sat(feb 12th), I told her that we needed to talk about something evry important.We met at our usual place, I took her to chinese restaurant and we started talking, first it was mostly the usual stuff, then she started telling me about her parents and her family and how strict they were.We talked a lot that day, after sometime we ended up in an ice cream parlour, thats when I asked her may be we should go out on the valentines day, she gave me avery cold stare and said "no." I thought ok! Wrong move.When we were just about to go back to her hostel,she said, "wait may be we should talk." We walked and walked, there was not much talking, then she suddenly looked up at me and said those wonderful words, "Is it possible?",not the usual picayune dialogues like, "do u love me" or "i love you".Thats what I liked about her, she guaged that there was no point in going on if the relationship is not going anywhere,read as marriage.And she knew that it was going to be difficult with all the parental pressures, so she she just put it very succinctly,if it was possible to go the distance,ofcourse hoping that I would get it.Thankfully I was wearing my thinking cap and I said "yes,it is." Only later did she confess that she was not responding to me after the holidays, coz she she was helplessly trying not to fall in love with me.Is it Possible?
