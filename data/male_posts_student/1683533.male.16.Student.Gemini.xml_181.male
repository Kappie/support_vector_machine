Also, this weekend is the Aquabats concert, I heard some of their stuff and I like it. ( it's Travis from Blink 182's old band) I heard they put on a good live show too. I know Ben wants to go, and maybe we should carpool?  I can get Marty to go too i bet, as long as he has a ride, he'll go to any concert.  Ben, post a comment about ideas.  We need a "stud locater" to put in my TV in my room.  I got to go, bye
