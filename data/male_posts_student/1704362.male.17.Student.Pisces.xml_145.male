On  this  fateful summer day, however, I made the mistake of choosing "The Beverly Hills Cop Trilogy" on DVD. As I listened to the disc spin up, I nearly chortled with glee with the thought of the gratuitous violence I was about to recieve. Several minutes into the film, I was lured into a hypnotic trance by its groovy synthpop soundtrack. Little did I know, "Beverly Hills Cop" is nothing more than an insidious piece of government propaganda, designed to force-feed programming into our atrophying brains!      Yeah, you smile now. You won't smile so much after I've punched you in the face, you big jerk.        Eddie Murphy: Does He Sneak Into Our Houses At Night And Steal Our Children?     Where was I?     I'll wipe that grin off your face with the back of my hand, asshole.   Ah, yes.   If you haven't already been lured into the story by the catchy 80's music, witty, fast-paced dialogue and expensive explosions, take a step back. Realize that your mind is being taken by force by the nefarious forces of evil known by some as Eddie Murphy and Jerry Bruckenheimer. Distracting your rational thinking, the movie implants several themes that contradict the very fundamental nature of reality.    Number One:  Getting around due process, undue search and seizure, and committing other variously grossly unconstitutional acts is easy AND fun if you're a plucky detective such as Axel Foley.    Number Two:  Jokes about how people in Beverly Hills are rich and people in Detroit are poor do not get old over the course of three movies and approximately six hours of viewing time.   Number Three:  Eddie Murphy's laugh doesn't remind you of a moose being beaten with a sick cat.   Number Four:  The Guy From "Mad About You" isn't a loser with a dead-end acting career. His role in the movie is deep and meaningful.     don't you start with me, Reiser, or i'll shut you up like i did your friend up there.   So, that about wraps it up. What is the purpose of these evil messages, waiting to insert themselves into your very soul? Who knows. I'm bored.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.paperclipart.com/    [Listening to: Take The Skinheads Bowling -  urlLink Camper Van Beethoven  -  (02:30)]
