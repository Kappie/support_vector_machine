We aqlso went down the bush for a while. there was an onld rusty car there, which was amusing for about 13 seconds. We sat and chatted for a while, and decided that if were just sitting and chatting that we  could just do that at aaron's place.  We got to aaron's place and did what we said, sat and chatted. Aaron seemed toi be enjoying him self.   1 Up shroom: Deon for today  Poisoned Shroom the kite for not being unstuck
