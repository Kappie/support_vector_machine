Of course, upon reaching home, the paranoid side of me got the calculator and started punching the figures and I have a class standing of about 71% (still C+) and even if I ace all the other long tests and quizzes...the highest point my final grade can reach is B (using Doc Mara's grading system in the syllabus)...so there...  However, he said in class that if we improve in the course for the next half of the term, he might give a greater weight to the better half...plus, my lowest long test will be cancelled so I still have chances...to score higher...but still not an A...  So there...I just billed in 2 (or maybe 3) service hours so great, I have 7 (or 6) to go...plus I can finish all of that with my volunteer work tomorrow (still as a COMELEC Volunteer) by sacrificing all my breaks...  So there...the COMELEC people were nice naman and the work was easy...well, exciting actually...me and another real volunteer just went and brought a karaoke machine in the CSR tapos I just had to time the speeches of the candidates and stuff, which was the fun part cause I got to watch the "miting de avance" and I made some of the candidates extra scares whenever I flash the "30 minutes left!" sign at their faces from my seat...hehehe...  We just did more hard work in ECE yesterday and we are now working in our final project, a power supply, which is 50% of our final grade...  There...we did "mock promotions" in PE kanina and it was not actually fun...kinda boring na rin I'd daresay...  Sige...I have several pages worth of Hulagpos to read before the midterms so there...    -ZzZzZzZzZz-
