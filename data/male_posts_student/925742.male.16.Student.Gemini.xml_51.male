Those only run on the gay StrongArm processors of computers past.  No worries... when new, better, FPSes for the PPC come out, my Xscale will be the best thing to play 'em on.  Shit, its got multimedia oompf.  Oompf, yo.  Only fags and fools don't understand or respect Latin.  It is the father of all languages.  So to you, fags and fools, I say this:  Ascendo tuum!  Up yours!            ||===(::::::::::::::::>
