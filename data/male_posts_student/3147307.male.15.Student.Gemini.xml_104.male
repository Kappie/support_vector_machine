And then we went to Ritters. Best frozen custard around! I then watched Starsky  Hutch at the dollar theater. It is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Got home at midnight, slept, woke up, ran 5 miles and now I am here typing. Well, that's exactly what I have done for the last 14 hours, and 34 minutes.
