Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.    urlLink Roses -OutKast Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #9 In the worst move of the year, Arista opted to put out “Roses” as a joint second single from  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below , as opposed to continuing the release of one single from each album to form a second single collective. Even if there was some underlying need to put both Big Boi and André in the same video, “Ghettomusick” seems the much more logical choice, even if it downplays André’s importance. Reaping commercial success only because of its novelty lyrics, which include the chorus, Big Boi’s “I want to see your support bra, not support you,” and André’s nearly-infamous ramble about Caroline’s fall into a ditch, “Roses” also needed its over-the-top video to hit big (which excellently parodies the supposed riff between Boi and Dré). But truth be told, the commonplace percussion, vamped techno lines, digital fuzz-bass, and funk organs are not enough to propel a second single from the most inventive hip-hop group ever.  Worst Moment:  While Big Boi is able to contribute a fitting rap to the song, Dré’s bizarre lyrical choices completely fall out of sanity with a line that puts him in the same league as Kool Keith: “Real guys go for real down to Mars girls.” Maybe Lance Bass would concur.   The Verdict:  5.8/10 - Brouhaha   (2.9/5)
