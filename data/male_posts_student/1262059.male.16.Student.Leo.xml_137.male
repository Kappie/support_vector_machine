Secondly, the comment-box-thingy isn't working.. but by the time you read this, it's probably already fixed.   I know I should be working, but my mind seems to be restless.. can't concentrate enough to do anything. I'll have to force myself to do something soon though.. because if I don't stick to the schedule, I'll be dead..^^;; fun.   ~Chronos (one of the shortest posts I have ever written)
