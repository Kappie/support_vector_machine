But all he can think of to say is that he is "really excited" to be home.  It can all be summed up with Tyke's fondness for his American keyboard.  He knows where all of the keys are and he can touch them with ease.  It sure does make typing out his blog quite a bit easier.  Speaking of ease, Tyke feels very much at ease right now being back home.  The trip was fun but for the last week Tyke was really feeling like he was ready to go home.  The first 9 days were spent in this quaint, but boring, little town of Tingewick which was about 10 minutes away from anything resembling city-life.  This wouldn't have been as bad if Tyke didn't feel quite ill for the entire time there.  If they were in the actual city of London or at least near a train station then everyone else could have done as they pleased and just come and gone with only the business of having one key to the house to deal with.  But instead they were stuck relying on the driving around to the nearest train station in the rental car they had.  This was also made worse by the fact that Tyke's parents are old and can't drive when faced with new situations.  The driving is done on the left and this is made worse with narrow lanes, a lack of a shoulder, and frequent roundabouts.  The roundabouts actually made things easier once you figure out who has the right of way and what lane exits to what turn.  England has it done pretty well with the roundabout system.  When Tyke did actually get to go out and do stuff the trains were pretty easy to use but they did use up a lot of time and were somewhat crowded.  All of the sights Tyke saw were really quite neat.  Westminster Abbey got a little boring after a while as everything Tyke saw was the same to him and eventually it lost it's appeal.  Not that it isn't worth visiting or that it isn't beautiful, but Tyke couldn't spend a whole day there for sure.  Warwick Castle was really neat, Salisbury Cathedral rocked, Buckingham Palace was ok (especially cuz it was funny seeing Vin Diesel of all people there), and Stonehenge probably would have been cooler if Tyke got to be stopped when he saw it but instead he just got the drive-by glances.  The train ride to Edinburgh wasn't bad and had some pretty scenery on the way there.  It was a little different than Washington but pretty similar.  More rolling hills than here though.  Edinburgh's sites were made much more enticing by the fact that they were staying in the middle of the city on the street where all the action was, and that they were in a wonderful apartment with full amenities.  The castle had great views and the city was pretty clean with great architecture.  Leaving Edinburgh ended up sucking because the train ride to Dover was hellish.  They just got unexpectedly stopped for a while on a couple of occasions.  Supposedly there was a problem with the overhead electrical cords and it turned out they weren't lying as Tyke saw the wreckage when they finally passed it.  But Dover wasn't all that cool once they got there.  A pretty slow town at night (as most places seemed to be) nothing really happened.  The castle was huge, but since they got in late at night and had to leave early the next morning, they never got to see it up close.  The hotel there was smoky and boring but it was only for a night.  The "hovercraft" to Calais, France wasn't that bad and it allowed for Tyke to see the white cliffs of Dover which were actually quite cool.  Then they got into France and immediately found out that they were in a foreign land.  They got in at 12:02 and needed to rent a car so they went to the booths where you could do so but everyone was closed.  Not to mention the fact that they didn't even have to clear French customs to get into the country.  Everyone was gone because it was 12 o'clock.  That meant that their 2 hour lunch break had begun and it seemed as though the entire country shut down for the two hours.  Most businesses were closed unless they were food oriented so Tyke's family had to get some lunch while they waited for a car agency to open up.  Finally they got a car, a Volkswagen Golf for the 4 of them and their 4+ bags of luggage.  It was a bit of a tight squeeze but it wasn't terrible.  At least they were driving on the same side of the road as the U.S.  Oh yeah, that reminds Tyke...the English drivers go incredibly fast.  Everyone speeds everywhere.  Their little cars really get going.  Tyke's family was in a pretty nice, and quite large by European standards, car that could go fast if they wanted to but they never felt it prudent to do so.  But everyone else would pass them when they were going about 80 in a "70" zone.  No cops are out patrolling really but there is supposed to be video surveillance that catches people.  But anyway, in France the drive to Normandy wasn't much fun but it didn't totally blow.  The land was nice and there were some really big and neat bridges they crossed.  The chateau they stayed in Tyke really didn't like but it was only for a night and it was still a chateau so that was at least a little cool.  Then they drove to Paris after visiting beaches and the American Cemetery.  This drive took wayyyyy longer than expected as they had to skirt the edges of Paris so as to avoid incredibly difficult traffic that they probably couldn't handle.  They finally made it to Charles de Gaulle Airport which is just outside of Paris really and they dropped off the rental car.  Then they had to find the trains to get into the city.  And they weren't sure where the train was stopping as it wasn't hitting every stop on the map.  Making this harder was that everything was written mainly in French so they didn't know what they were reading.  Finally they got to a station where they realized it would probably be smarter to take a cab to their hotel.  And then they couldn't get a taxi for a while.  Finally they got one who could take everyone at once and they made their way to the hotel.  They tipped the taxi driver quite a bit but they didn't care.  They were glad to be at their destination.  The room was on the top floor but was smoking hot inside.  They got two fans to cool the place down and that helped but it was still hot.  They were in a good location though which helped for trips around the city.  The subway there is really easy to use.  Tyke mastered it quickly.  Even though it was in French Tyke could read everything fine.  He learned a few French words that he now knows but not enough to live there for more than 3 days.  Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Arc d'Triomphe, everything was really cool.  Paris was the best city.  Clean and not too big like London was.  It was easy to get to everywhere and it had beautiful architecture everywhere.  Tyke really enjoyed Paris.  You should all get there sometime.  But Tyke did leave Paris for London Saturday night and then slept there for one night.  Then he got up this morning and went to Heathrow Airport.  The 9 hour flight was not that bad.  Tyke wasn't ever tired unfortunately so he didn't get a wink of sleep the entire time.  Also, the volume control on his headphones didn't work for the in-flight movies and stuff so he couldn't watch the movies.  However, the first movie was Starsky and Hutch again while that was followed by Lethal Weapon and then Calendar Girls.  Tyke just put his MP3 player on and listened to music the whole time while watching the movies at the same time.  He finished reading his third book of the trip, Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris.  It's a funny collection of personal essays.  The first essay of part two was probably the best one and Tyke also read it while in Paris which made it funnier cuz the action takes place in Paris too.  But you might enjoy it so pick it up.  Tyke hasn't really read much of Deception Point, another Dan Brown book but he did read of course Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  Both were good tales.  And Tyke actually read them and did it quickly which was quite shocking to his mother.  But after the 9 hours somehow passed on the long flight, Tyke got to Vancouver, B.C. and waited around to get on his next flight to Sea-Tac.  This flight was a small plane that seated 33 people today.  It had propellers and in order to get on and off they had to walk down onto the tarmac and step directly on the plane.  It was like Tyke was either the President or a member of the Olympic team returning with a gold medal to the land of his adoring fans.  Needless to say, Tyke felt honored to be able to go through such an event.  And then they got in their "limo" (a Town Car really) and watched as they were driven home.  Then Tyke came home, looked at messages he got (thanks for em), and then unpacked and showered.  He is ready for tomorrow to begin though.  A new day and a new life.  Summer now begins for Tyke...college is not far off though.  Folks, Tyke is just so excited to be home now.  This is great.
