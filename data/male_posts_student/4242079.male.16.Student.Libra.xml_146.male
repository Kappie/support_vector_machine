     
      Some days it's easier to turn off the world Than to suffer through the words you say Maybe I hate everything about you And so I drown you in my music  The mind and body, they just shut down Satisfaction comes in the idleness Trapped in silence within the noise I will bleed for you no more  I hope you choke on the words you spew at me I hope you fall over the obstacles you've placed for me I hope you choke on the criticisms you offer me I will bleed for you no more.
