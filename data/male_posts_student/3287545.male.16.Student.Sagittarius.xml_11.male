It actually made me laugh, I though it was quite cool. Yeah, whoever said it is a total wanker, but at least people now recognise me. I did think about putting my finger up without lookin back but I didn't. Anyway, school is almost finished, tommorrow will be my last full day at school. Everyone's got books and getting people to sign them and stuff. I'll have to remember to bring one in tommorrow myself. It's really sad, cause I've really made some good friends these last six months and I feel now like they're all leaving. I kinda don't want to go to Ireland anymore but i'll just have to see what happenes. I would love it if the rest of my family went away and I stayed with one of my friends like Laura B or someone that would be so cool. I feel so close to Laura B at the moment, I'm actually starting to imagine myself kissing her. Don't worry, I havn't swiched teams, just feel like being close to her and having a 'bond' with someone. It would be good practice too. I might even say something some time. If we get on the subject of kissing, I'll say I've never kissed and need practice and It'll go on from there. Life at school, is, really quite good right now. Finally I feel like I can be myself. Talk about guys, fashion and stuff, it's all good. Dean was looking gorgeous today. He was wearing shorts, so I could get a look at his beautifuly long slender legs. He knows I fancy him, and things get really awkward when we see each other. There ain't much eye contact goin on. Oh well, I don't expect him to feel the same.
