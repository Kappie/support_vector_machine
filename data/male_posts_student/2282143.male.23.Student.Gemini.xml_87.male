At least have the decency to kill the entire bottle before filling it back up with water.  Only drinking half of a bottle of vodka then filling it up with water just ruins the bottle.  Dont do it kids.   2.  Morning Relief works like gangbusters.  TIme of transformation?  Half an hour.  But apparently it makes you feel like a new person.  Good call. 3.  Still dont eat the Habanero.   4.  Bill's attempt at reading multiple books this summer is quite the feat.  I think I will stick to my Cat in the Hat and Go Dog Go, thank you. 5.  Time goes way too fast when you dont want it to, but drags on forever when you want it to go by.   6.  I complain about not having a social life, but when something comes up, I make excuses, like Im too tired or dont have the money.  Fucking slap me if I do that to you.   7.  THEY TOOK OUR JORRRBS! 8.  Ive come to the realization that Founder's Day is going to be a big celebration.  Not only of getting together with friends, but also of my brithday being the day before. 9.  I still dont know what I want for my birthday.  Dont get me anything.  Or maybe money.  Money is nice.   10.  The zoo is slow on beautiful days like today.  Whats up with that?  I mean, sure it was a bit chilly, but overall, it was a pretty sweet day to be out and about. Ok, well, I guess its time for bed.  That and Im too tired to remember things going on right now.  Oh yeah, after 3 months those bastards are finally getting around to fixing the hott tubb.  Awww yeah.  Hott Tubb... Gonna make you sweat!  Derp.
