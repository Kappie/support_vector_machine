I just now got my internet back up and running from where I had to format and reinstall my computer after I screwed it up *blush* Anyway, I've gotten almost everything back on it, though I'll have to fix setting back on it, but that shouldn't take to long.  I went to my Nana and Papaw's home today; in what we call the middle of nowhere- where I got all the addresses off of their old computer to the new one. An easy task. Give me no praise.
