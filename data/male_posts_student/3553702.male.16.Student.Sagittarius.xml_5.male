Because the love of my life, my girlfriend if you will, is there right now visiting her father. And it sucks for me. Because I only get to talk to her on AIM and the phone. I don't want to put my girlfriend's name, so I will refer to her as Beautiful for this blog. I haven't asked her if I could talk about *us* so I'll keep her name secret. Anyway, Beautiful and I are what I would consider serious, although I can't really explain it. I guess its because we're both kind of outsiders in our own respects. She is AWESOMELY beautiful and this alone seperates her from other girls. It also doesn't help that she thinks for herself on such things as politics and sexuality. She has a brain. And that makes her different. Me, I've always been kind of "out there" because I'm the kind of kid that prefers books to people in a lot of cases and the friends that I do have are all different in their own respects. While I'm doing this, I think I'll talk about my different friends. I apoligyze now if I miss a couple, I'll explain why I'm not typing a whole lot later in this entry.  Like I did with Beautiful, I am going to substitute my friend's names with things that have to do with them.  Warlock: Part of my "band", Warlock plays: you guessed it, a B.C. Rich Warlock and he fricking rocks. I love listening to him play, especially stuff he made up himself. He and I are awesome friends, mostly because we're a lot alike. He loves music and guitar about as much as I love books and writing. It doesn't hurt that we both love (and are quite skilled at) Halo, an FPS for the X-Box. Anyway, we're good friends and I can tell Warlock just about anything. Its funny, because I'm into metal music about as much as he is, but we don't listen to ANY of the same stuff. He listens to Slip Knot and Hatebreed, the "secular" groups, and I listen to Demon Hunter and Living Sacrifice, Christian metal groups. Even though we can't talk about specific bands much, we seem to know EXACTLY what the other is talking about when we discuss music for our band or just in general.  Drummer: ALSO part of my "band", Drummer is the infamous "drummer without drums"...I can't totally explain this, but because of some crazy parents and some damage to his truck, Drummer can't buy a set of drums. This is a SERIOUS drain on the rest of the band, but we try to be patient with him. Drummer and I get along well, but not for any apparent reason. We don't really have anything in common, although I think we have a certain understanding when it comes to some stuff. In things such as moral dilemas and ethical situations, we typically agree on the same course of action, which is a good thing.  Red Rage: Red Rage is our "band's" bassist...and a red head. Infamous for NEVER letting ANYONE borrow ANYTHING, RR is still a good guy...even if he is a little stingy with his change. RR and I agree on just about EVERYTHING having to do with music and its really good that those anti-music sharing people haven't seen how many CDs we've burned for each other...there's about four years of jail for both of us right there.  David: I can't think of a good nick-name for David, so I'll just call him David. Its not his name, so no big. David and I play on M (Link in last entry) together and we've become VERY good friends through all of our comunication. We're both heavy into sci-fi style movies and stuff, so we can relate easily on books and such.  That's all I'm going to do for now. Expect to see these names again. LEARN THEM WELL! LEARN THEM I SAY! Or don't...its cool.  So, back to the stuff about Beautiful. We are missing each other horribly while she's in NYC, and seriously awaiting her return next Friday.  On to my second topic: short hair. Why do I need to talk about short hair? Because I HAVE BEEN BUTCHERED!!! I went to the usual barber shop I always go to except this time there was a guy there who I'd only let cut my hair once before. Before I go any deeper, let me explain something: this isn't a "regular" hair salon place. This is one of those places cowboys and "real men" go to get their hair cut. Either way, so I let this "newbie" cut my hair...and he butchered it! I wear my hair spiky on top with sideburns, and medium height hair on the sides and back. Now, I have almost NOTHING on the sides and back, no sideburns, and the top is short enough that if I wet it, I could spike it with a brush of my hand! THIS IS MESSED UP! I think I'll stop now...before I break something. My hair doesn't even really matter to me, but incompetence does and there was NO WAY that a good barber would have done this.  And finally...jammed fingers. Jammed fingers suck. Bad. I was feeding my dog (minature weenie dog) and as I was turning to go back inside, I brushed my knee on the door frame. This caused me to trip, and planting ALL OF MY UPPER-BODY WEIGHT ON MY FINGER!!! My finger has proceeded to swell to double its size...quite painful. Its amazing I have been able to write this post, seeing as how I can't extend the finger far enough to touch the number keys...Note the lack of numbers in this post.  Well, I think this is how I'll do most of my posts: just talk/comment on various stuff happening to me and around me. I think this place will fill up pretty fast once school starts back up...
