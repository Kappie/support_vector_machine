Criticize the President, feel the wrath. Remember the Dixie Chicks and how they were "ashamed Bush is from Texas." I'm suretheir recording studioswere ashamed too...of their  record sales , after that episode. Then came Whoppi Goldberg and heranti-Bush remarks. Well, let me just say "You're fired!" Yes, her contract was killed. Now we have a Las Vegas performer, Linda Ronstadt, thrown out of a Casino (and never welcome back, says the owner) for dedicating a song to Michael Moore. I guess it's one thing to take politics to the extreme, but this is a democracy, not a Communist dictatorship. After all,our currentpresident'sfather killed that kind of government (well, at least he took credit for it in his '92 State of the Union). In my opinion, they'resaving the weapons of mass destructionso they can unleash them on Michael Moore if Bush loses the election. I guess free speech is just ... limited ... these days.
