Being compressed into a seat smaller than the ones on the train, eating microwaved rubber, and emerging from a sleepless delirium to find yourself somewhere awful. Wonderful. Still, airplane radio is good. I usually like at least one song on it. Or the microscopic TV in the headrest ahead of me. Oh well. See you in 3 weeks, then. Fond farewells, my friends. Leave any well-wishing by Commenting.
