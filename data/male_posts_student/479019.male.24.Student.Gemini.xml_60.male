I remember when I saw  The (International) Noise Conspiracy  in the December, that The Hives said that everyone was going to be dancing to "Hate to Say I Told You So" six months later. Looks like their prediction is coming true. They were #5 on KROQ's Furious 5 at 9 last night. Did I mention I'm seeing them next month in San Diego? That's going to rock. They put on some of the best live shows ever!  Damn... Mr. Brett must be happy with this.   ***
