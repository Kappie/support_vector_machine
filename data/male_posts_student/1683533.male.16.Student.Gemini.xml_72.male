We got in the arguement on how much time i should get to practice on tuesdays.  I ASK FOR ONE DAY WHERE I CAN GO SEE MY FRIENDS AND SHE HAS TO BE A BIG JERK AND MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.  She thinks I should only get 3 hours of practicing... EVEN IF I FINISH MY HOMEWORK BEFORE I GO!!!!!!!!!!  WHAT THE!?!?...MOM...WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??  and her reason is...it is a weeknight...BUT WHAT IF I GOT MY HOMEWORK DONE AT 3:00 that means I have to leave a 6...WHY!?!?!...THEN SHE KEEPS SAYING ITS A WEEKNIGHT AND HOMEWORK IS PRIORITY, and i already explained to her that my homework would be done before i left...SO I GOT MAD CAUSE SHE IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STUBBORN, GEEZ!!
