I can say pretty confidently that it will be boring because I'm pretty sure what's going to happen. The adults will all talk and my sister and her friends will talk and my friend, (lives down the street) all he'll want to do is play or do stupid stuff and frankly I think I've been spending too much time with him... or too little time with my other friends. Either way I need to get outta the house sometime and just be by myself for the day. I would really like to go see that new movie called "The Notebook" ~hint hint nudge nudge [to any of you who would like to see it or would like to see me, but I'm guessing it's the first one]~ anyway if anyone wants to go see that movie with me give me a call on my wireless [wireless sounds sooo much kooler than cell] o yeah i guess you people need the number... wait who am i talking to? There are two possibilities.  Option 1). A 45 yr old man is reading this getting turned on thinking about raping me [eww] because he's a pervert... or  Option 2). No one is reading this in which case I would prefer this over option 1.  Well if there is somebody out there reading this and they "know me" [qoutes because some people might stalk me and think they know me even if I've never met them in my life] then call my wireless. I won't be holding my breath for any calls anytime soon so don't worry about living up to any expectations.  I guess there is really nothing much else to say, even though this whole post is just a bunch of pish posh [me rambling on about stupid, unimportant stuff]  Catch you cats on the flip flop later
