Mums friend came down again (bah), so they talked so freakin loud in side the place, it was louder than the haircutter ppl speaking their jappanises(sp) talk.   But compaired to how that went, i got myself trimmed to a "mr. Arias" cut by a nice lookin asain chick, we both talked alittle bit and i actually understood her unlike the others i tried talking to in previous cuttings.  Then we went to one of my moms friends house to get her friends watch from her friends house (confusing aint it).   We went in, got it, stayed for like 10 minutes.  When we are about to leave, this hot chick comes walking in that they said she was feeling kinda bad.   Wow, all these weeks of conditioning really paid off, cause it was a pain in the ass just to hold my jaw in one place.    Kinda looked like an older taller Avery but hotter.     Dunno why she decided to stay out whether it was to stay out because of guests or just to watch me in my posing bouncer stance (heh i had my backstage security shirt on too).     I saw her sneak a few peaks too.  Har har.  Practice was good this week, hurt my arm doing something, embarraseed myself in a play and the coach thought it was a simple mistake (and he was screaming at the guy who made a mistake on the play before this one).  So its been a wierd week.  Now as i finish this post up, i see in my mom's friends bag o close, there is a red thong.   She has been talking about a friend she was seeing earlyer, but damn common, your like 37 years old. grow up.  Its a pain trying to amagine her in it, though i have been trhough her whole lingerie drawer when i was 12 (assuming its from her highschool year), but seeing it in her bag here just makes me think less and less of her.   ugh.
