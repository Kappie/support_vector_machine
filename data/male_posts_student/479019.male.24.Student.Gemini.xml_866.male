       
      [15904]   I will be out of town until Saturday night or Sunday afternoon.  I'll be in NJ for the next two days with relatives. Then I'll be hanging with Melissa on Friday. I'm going to try to meet up with my cousin Kelly on Saturday afternoon before I come back to Binghamton.   Cell me if you need to reach me. I won't have internet access for a few days! (Well there's wireless web)  I need to fix some of the javascript on this page when I get back.  ***
