I'm tired of news.  I'm tired of drama.  I'm tired of fighting losing battles for inconsequential shit.  I want to talk about shit.  In the past two months, my scat has gone from ordinary crap to abstract renderings of art and language.  It started after Matt Martin's wedding in April up in Arkansas...which is amusing, because in no way can Matt Martin create a bowel movement to emulate anything other than gruel.  Anyway, the day after the wedding and after playing Power Hour and after vomiting all in the driveway and grass (not the bathroom, Daryl Burrows), I woke up at Dan Young's house I think, and drove to Wearsch's (why didn't I stay at Wearsch's if I was going to go there in the morning?), and took the beer shit.  Four minutes later, I got up and marveled at my creation.  Now, my high school friends are the kinds of people who play swords and compare penis and testicle sizes in front yards of homes in Dallas suburbs, so brevity is lacking.  However, we never really compared poo.  So I asked if we were the kinds of friends who compared poo.  Turns out we are, and it marveled the two Dan's.  Estimated length was 18-21", and it was shaped like the Oron, or the symbol on the book in  urlLink The Neverending Story .  Today's shit wasn't as great, though it was a perfect representation of the roman numeral "7" drawn in calligraphy.    Why is shit disgusting?  Everyone shits.  Everything shits.  I have two friends whose large intestines were removed because of ulcers similar to dyspepsia or peptic ulcer disease, so they can't really shit, but they still excrete waste.  Why should I be afraid of it?  Why do Brits refer to the Water Closet behind closed doors?  Why did my ex girlfriend turn the water on every time she took a dirty dump...she didn't turn it on when she peed, so I knew what was going on.  One of my best friends has over 30 distinct armpit farts, and my roommate can emulate each through his ass.  It is hilarious.  Both make me laugh uproariously.  The only time I ever heard anyone laugh harder than at one of Dan Young's armpit fart concerts was one time when I told the story of me battering my pants up at Borders in South Austin, but that instance also included one person rolling around the floor in a pool of his own drool, and another girl so sickened she contorted into Carol Channing during the anecdote.  Eddie Murphy's best comic routine was all about shit.  Poo is fascinating!    Shit aside, I give you the glory of  urlLink The Nub .  As one of my friends said, I just want to suckle it.  Me too.    There is no drama at The Nub.  No bitching, no stupid belabored instances.  All is forgiven, all is forgotten.  The Nub is in the moment; a present phantasmagoria of camraderie and kinship, echoing out to the poor, huddled masses entwined in the day's folly.  Everyone is bedazzling.  Everyone is important.  Everyone has a soft hue of radiance, enveloping the perimeter into a radiance unsurpassed by neon lights and Fanta billboards.   I want to share Montreal with a girl.  She doesn't have to be my height; the head fits against the shoulder better that way, but as long as the arm can rest on her shoulders, and I can tilt my head just the right way to smell her hair and her essence, and we can look at the same city and talk about how we see it differently, it will work.  A small hotel on the outskirts of town, with a bedroom painted in warm colors and a bed with warm covers, is all we need.  We spend days walking the pier, taking bicycle tours and viewing botanical gardens and museums, and we spend the nights in coffee shops, talking to locals and tourists, eating a six-course meal at a restaurant that only has one seating, where the music is provided by a Greek accordian player who speaks Spanish, French, and English, and plays  urlLink I'm Just A Gigilo , and the chef comes out and sings, and soon the entire restaurant is singing in chorus, language not a barrier, and everyone goes home after a round of hugs and toasts and laughs, and we get back to our hotel room, and create some of the most passionate energy we've ever known, and we lie in bed, together, not talking, just listening to short breaths punctuated by the rare deep, and, for us, that is Montreal.    Fuck you, Donald Rumsfeld.   urlLink Fuck You .  Today...you can't ruin it for me.  I've got jedi and shits and nubs and Montreal to make me happy.
