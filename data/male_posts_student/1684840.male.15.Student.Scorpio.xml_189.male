This morning we woke up early again for the London hotel brekkie and then made our way to a different bus stop where we had to wait shortly for bus no. 7 which went up past the British Museum, down Oxford Street and around a part of Hyde Park to the Royal Albert Hall. We got off the bus after about 15 - 20 minutes and head off around the corner to the Science Museum. No sooner had we entered and gone up to the second floor, an emergency announcement was made and everyone had to evacuate!   Annoyed, we went next door to the Natural History Museum which was really cool, but seriously packed! Feeling a bit claustrophobic, I left and we had hotdogs and a slushie from the truck outside. We then took the bus through Piccadilly Circus and past Soho to the British Museum. This building's architecture was amazing. We went around a few areas and in one exhibit of life and death, there were two timelines of medicene and stories of the lives of a man and woman, from birth until death. Beside each timeline were pills lined up in rows indicating the medicene each person would take in their life. It was very interesting and cleverly done.   After visiting here (and having the worst orange juice from all the holiday) we met back up with Grandma and set off home just as it started raining. Less than 2 hours and a boring trip up the morotway, we were home, Woohoo!   A couple of hours after arriving, I was invited round to Craig's house for a 'sleepover' (I didn't actually sleep... much!) We had a laugh and watched Family Guy and Chris brought his cool mate Joe round and we had a great time. Chris and Craig fell asleep and me and Joe just sat up chattin' a bit until he went to sleep and I just sat there on the sofa. I eventually dozed off for about 30 minutes and then woke up and had some more apple Tango... *burrrrp*   Pictures from London are up, check out the Gallery now!
