In the middle of the room is a large capsule which contains a red echidna with a small tuft of hair on his forehead and mittens with two clear spikes on them. "Knumchuck?" whispers Sa2b. Knumchuck is Sa2b and Camo's long-lost, blind brother with his own way of seeing. "Seems that he's asleep. How do you suppose we wake him?" says Camo. "Easy," says Sa2b, "we play with the buttons!" So, Camo and Sa2b start pressing every button they can find. Then, Sa2b notices something in the corner. "Hey, look! It's Knumchuck's retractable, all-purpose cane!" Suddenly, as he was saying that, Knumchuck's eyelids open up to reveal two, pure blue eyes. The entire room suddenly blows up, wiping out the entire base. Hours later, when the two brothers awaken, they look over and notice Knumchuck lying unconcious in the middle of what used to be the room. They pick him up and carry him out of the rubble.  *Ready, First Mate Sa2b?* *Ready, Captain Gage!* *Prepare for jump cut!* *Ay-ay, Cap'n!*  After the three got home and Knumchuck was revived, Sa2b decided to go for a walk. He passed by an alleyway and noticed a yellow, two-tailed fox with purple, white-tipped hair up in a ponytail, a black belly shirt, jeans, and black sneakers with white toes. "Hi," says Sa2b. "Hello," says the fox, "who are you?" "My name is Sa2b. What's your's?" "My name's Juliet, but they call me Foxy." "Who calls you that?" "Them," says Foxy, as she points to a tree. "The... birds call you Foxy?" "Yeah, I have this ability to talk to animals, so there basically my only friends. Oh, and also, most people I touch are in a coma within three seconds." "Well, I can teleport, I have claws that come out of my knuckles, a 15 foot tongue, the ability to change my outer form, and I control lightning and magnetism." "Wow, that's so cool!" "Hey, you want to come live with me and my brothers? It doesn't really look like you have a place to stay." "Thanks, I'd love to." "Foxy, it looks like this is the start of a beautiful relationship."  Guess who's back, Back again, S.I.'s back, With   THE END  .  And Darkblaze, I forgive you. -Sane Intolerant-
