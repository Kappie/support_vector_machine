I saw this girl at Coral Sec's bustop while on the bus home.. Man! was she pretty~! Her ponytail was so long, it reached her ass. And that pretty face of hers.. I was like 'WOW' lol! Maybe I'll see her one day.. then I'll ask her number haha. Nah, juz kidding. Wouldn't dare to anyway. Then there was this guy and girl I saw at a coffeeshop near my place. The guy was like shouting at her. Saying something like, "Why don't you want to come to my house?" Bloody sicko.. Hope the girl's alright..   Got new books to get.. lost my science TYS! I knew I shouldn't have left them at school. Someone must have stolen them during the holidays. (Well, that gives me a good excuse to escape my teacher's wrath!) hahaha! Gonna buy them later.. Lots of homework too.. Boring!   Breaking - Gonna practice on my flares and footwork after my work. Gonna seriously try out airflares too. Hope I can get them soon..
