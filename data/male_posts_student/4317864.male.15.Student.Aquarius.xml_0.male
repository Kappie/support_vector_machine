I talked to my sister a bit, saw one of her friends, and did other stuff.  The other stuff I can't really remember, but I probably checked Utopia. And I also probably checked the usual route of comics and forums and other sites.  The daily routine, in essense. I did, however, do some things of note today, which I will note like a good little boy. I drew a little logo for Sparty's "F2 Wants YOU!" promotional poster. It's a little hand clenching together, on fire. I drew it in Photoshop CS, which, by all rights, I actually shouldn't have, but I do. It looks pretty good for something done with the pen tool, which is fine by me.  Anyways, today I read Death of a Salesman (the play by Arthur Miller, for the uninformed). I thought it was pretty good, but any real enjoyment I might've gleaned from reading it was wiped from existence since it's for school. A shame, really. I also took a nap from 12ish to 3ish. It was revitalizing and refreshing, but it made me hungry. So I grabbed some chips and some apple juice and finished up Death of a Salesman.  That was an unfortunate move on my part, as it sort of crossed out eating dinner, something I will attempt to do after I post this. I wrote up a bit of history for my web-comic, planned some things out, drew another outline of a character, this time with clothes on.  Did I cover everything? No, no. I also wrote a quick essay comparing (actually just summarizing, really) No Exit and Death of a Salesman. I hate writing comparative things. They suck, because I'm bad at them and just end up explaining each story thoroughly, with some minor points of how they relate to each other.  I didn't totally finish the essay; I'll be revising that one and my other comparative one soon. By and large, I prefered the essay on Thoreau the most, since it really allowed me to explain and argue effectively. I have Andrew to thank for that one, I guess.  That's about the order of the day. I can't think of anything else of interest or use to record, besides the fact that I got a present from my step-mother. It's a little Simpsons bottle opener that plays a quote of Homer when you open anything with it. It's cute and amusing.    Mmm, beer. Woo-hoo!
