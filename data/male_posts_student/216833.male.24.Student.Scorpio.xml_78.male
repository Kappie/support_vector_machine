After throwing on the same pair of shorts and the same t-shirt I was wearing last night., mimi and I scurried off to my office to change out the weekend backup tapes from the servers. After that we drove out to the Ft.Worth Natural History Museum to check out the exhibit and watch thte show in the planetarium. We got there and the parking was a mess - there is some sort of farm animal show out at the will rogers area. The exhibit wasn't like I remember'd. It was small, unorganized and just seemed to be missing alot of things. Must have been another museum, I am just confused. The planetarium was ok, it was targeted at younger crowd for sure, but I still enjoyed the tips for finding navigational stars. That was very informative.  We went from there to a mexican food resturant and shot out to the mall to see if they had any more disael canvas mules for men. no dice. So I took mimi back home - she had to leave for work at 3pm. I went to get some of the pictures from our honeymoon developed. Got em back,
