But we missed our stop and went on the expressway where it only stopped nearing Changi Airport. But we thought we could cross the road to take us back to school, only to find out that none of the buses bring us back. So we thought we would just get into any bus and get closer to school first. But turned out that before we could get even close to school, the bus turned into an expressway that brought us to Woodlands via Pasir Ris. And we took taxi back from Seleter Camp.  Well, just wanted to fill up this entry I accidentally created. Oh well.
