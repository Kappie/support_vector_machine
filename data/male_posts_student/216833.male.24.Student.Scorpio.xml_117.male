I went to Wal-mart to buy a newspaper, some shades, and some 409 to clean up the place. That took longer than it should, what else is new.  I stopped at Subway and got some food - went home and picked up Precious. I took her to get a rabie shot. That was pretty easy, when I was waiting on the paper work - I put her in the back seat and turned on the car so she wouldn't get hot. When I walk back to the car, she is taking a SHIT in my back seat. HOLY FUCKING SHIT.   I drove to a dumpster and scoped it all out, now I gotta go scrub out the soiled spot. EWW!  Poor pupp gets all nervous after shots, she is famous for shitting in the vet's office. I wish that was true in this case.   current mood:  sick
