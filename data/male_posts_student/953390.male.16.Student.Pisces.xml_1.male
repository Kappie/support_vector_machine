They must be musical perfection, because there is no better that I can think of within 2 minutes. ;-P I just got the UK version of their self-titled album, which must be the only thing even resembling something close to boring (that is, the title). I especially love 'It Can't Come Quickly Enough.'  THAT  is the textbook example of perfect song. I don't think I've heard male vocals achieve as much as that on electronica.   GO JAKE SHEARS!!!   I really don't want to sound like a fanatic but... if you ever read this, please  urlLink email me here.  Or IM me @ sockeatingdryer (AIM)
