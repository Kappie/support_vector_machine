After that, me and my mom went to Wal-Mart and I spent got this super cool steering wheel cover and a cute Sponge Bob air freshener. Of course, seeing a poster stand, I had to buy an Orlando Bloom poster and a Spider-Man 2 poster. I also got the Three Days Grace cd, which I totally am loving. If you're into alternative rock, definetely buy this CD. A few days ago I bought the Bourne Identity DVD, since I'm going to be seeing the Bourne Supremacy tomorrow. I love it. There's this one part that made me jump really high out of my seat. And wow, Matt Damon is pretty hot too :)!!!
