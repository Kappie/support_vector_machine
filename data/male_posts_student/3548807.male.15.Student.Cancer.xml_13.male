Dan left this afternoon. it was quite nice to see him even if it were for just a bit  on saturday i was planning on maybe hanging out with some people and seeing a movie. so i figured "alright hanging out!" then i heard tamsen say "ohh we could get "her" to come" and i was even happier even though i would've had to leave my brother. but then it turns out that she had to babysit and whatev....but yeah that was my weekend in a nutshell...
