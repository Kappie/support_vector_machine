Almost got "stress stroke". Tonnes of homework came to me and I felt so stressed that I did nothing in the end. So I did not touch my computer. Ok, enuff of the sorries... oops. (=X) j/k. I'll start today's diary today then. First thing in school, first period, Mr Yap was so mad of the class... He was being slandered online(dun tell which page =P). He said he loved the whole class and in return, the class hurt him emotionally. haix... poor Mr Yap. During Chemistry lesson, Mr Wong kept calling my name cause I was not paying attention at the back of the class. Sean Lee kept disturbing me and made me burst into laughter when he used the hose of water from the sink to spray Clarence and Xiu Juan(sry if I hurt u guys :X). Haix... I am a playful boy by nature, very hard to change. During Physics, we did the Refraction thingyy then got homework to do... *Sigh*. What a day for Mr Yap. I feel so sorry for him. As I was typing this bloggie, my morale became higher and better, can't wait for the day to come. If u dun noe wad I mean, its ok. hahaha.. I write till here, hopefully I'll write more at nite. So happy!! Finally I can make IC!!!!! Hurray!!!.
