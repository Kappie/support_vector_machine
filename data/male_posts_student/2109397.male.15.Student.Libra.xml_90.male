I played on Tuesday it was, with Sam, Jon, Warren, and Alex. I personnaly played like shit. I've played at the Soccer Park billions of times. Sometimes its open sometimes its not. This time it wasnt open and we didnt think much of it just squeeze through the gate as usual. Well once we were done playing and just chilling there this white truck drive over. The guy was like yall aint supposed to be here. Yall gots to get a permit to play here these are game only fields no practice. I'm like ok show me the god damn sign you hick bastard. The place is a freaking public park wtf. He was like its ok yall didnt know but next time i might hafta clal the police . I was lik yea bitch suck my dick. Ill b up here tomoro call them then u little whorebag stupid fuck.  I rolled my ankle and its a lil bruised/swollen/tender. I think I'm going up there to play today too, we shall see how much truoble we get into. The fucking guy was driving his truck on the fields and he thinks us playing on it is gooing to tear it up.
