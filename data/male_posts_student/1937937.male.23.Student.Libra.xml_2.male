Of course, by "we", I really mean me: my name is Rob Barry, and I'm a student of mathematics at the  University of Miami .  My brief career also includes such notable institutions as  Haverford College  and  Florida International University .  I enjoy life -- a bit too much.  My enjoyment landed me in the  hospital  a few months back (18 to be precise), where I was told... well, that's skipping ahead a bit.  No need to reveal the whole package in the first post!  My interests are varied.  I am currently studying the  Riemann Hypothesis  (what young mathematician isn't?), but my work there is a bit lacking, as I have yet to finish linear algebra.  In fact, I've never produced an original thought in my life -- I'm still trying to catch up with all the thoughts these other people have already had.  I'm also interested, when it comes to math, in  fractal geometry .  I've designed programs that evaluate both the Riemann Hypothesis as well as fractals, but they are written in variants of  BASIC  and are therefore painfully slow.  When I was a young teen, I learned  Turbo PASCAL  -- little did I know that the wave of the future would be this C business!  I don't know how to program C, but plan to learn.  When I was a freshman in college, I tried to learn the  theory of relativity , but really was only able to grasp the  Lorentz Transformation .  I believe that from the perspective of a photon,  the universe is but a point !  Quite an intriguing idea, but I'm sure somebody else has already had it.  I've very little to offer in the way of true knowledge: I proclaim to be versed in various subjects (history, literary theory, mathematics), but I'm not -- it's all a facade.  Except I've lately discovered that one must actually pursue ones interests beyond the level of perusal, and thus I've begun my focus on mathematics.  I find it fascinating that what originated as a way to determine quantities of real objects -- such as sheep -- has provided us with a framework for understanding the universe on the deepest level.  Why should it be that the rules of addition should apply universally?  The question sounds obvious; but the point is not.  This is the area in which subjectivity and objectivity meet: when we have a subjective quantity of sheep, few, and we add another subjective quantity of sheep, also few, we have yet another subjective quantity: more.  Thus, we can say that few plus few equals more.  However, why should this always hold true?  And when we break the sheep down from a subjective few to a quantified and objective five, then we can say that five sheep plus five sheep is always equal to more: ten sheep.  Fingers retain this property, as do crates of marijuana, as do books and museums.  All definable objects in the real world appear to be countable: that is, we can always have a given quantity of real objects, a quantity that can be fixed to infinite precision: we can have two and a half sheep, two and one third sheep, etc., and there is no apparent level of divisibility beyond which we can no longer alter the number of sheep by yet a smaller amount.  The nature of matter probably does not retain this property: it is likely that there is a limit to divisibility; in fact, it is likely that these concepts do not apply at all on the most microscopic levels.  And yet the rules for manipulating numbers appear to apply at all levels, and quite accurately!  The rules appear to always be identical.  What's the deal with that?  It seems so basic and yet so complex.  While I know that complexity is not necessarily dependent on size (see  Stephen Wolfram 's massive new tome on the subject), I also feel that irreducibility of complexity should be something more apparent.  Our brains are structured by the same set of rules, and yet we do not, inherently, seem to understand their more fundamental nature.  I've hit an area on which I can not write with clarity, because my understanding breaks down.  I've never thought it through.  I'd like to know more about this quality of nature, and thus, I've devoted myself to this study of mathematics to the best of my ability.  It takes a lot of work, I've discovered, work that I, for the most part, enjoy.  I'd like to make a remarkable discovery, but I am, I hope, somewhat cognizant of the fact that many brilliant men have already trodden this path, and remarkable discoveries are few and far between.  At most, I genuinely hope to be able to correspond with others regarding this subject.  I hope to be able to post on this Blog frequently, and as a result, to attract some attention to myself -- positive or negative, I do not care -- which, I earnestly hope, will allow me the opportunity to communicate with others.  My name is  Rob Barry , and by clicking on my name, you can send me an e-mail.  My address is rbarry@haverford.edu.  Thank you for joining me!
