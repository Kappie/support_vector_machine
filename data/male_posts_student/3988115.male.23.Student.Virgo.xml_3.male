Those brave and dedicated IPL employees that toiled, sweated and cried for the dream of a united Academic/Public library will be scattered like ashes to the wind among the various branches of the Irving Public Library system, broken and allotted like slaves at the auction block under the cruelAlabama sun. Those books which once stood so proudly on our shelves, virtually shouting their vast reservoir of knowledge to our patrons(student and public)will be divvied up like so much pirate treasure booty among the branches of IPL. The children's library, the gleaming jewel in the eye of knowledge that was NLCL, will close, it's lights dimmed forever, no longer able to battle against the ignorance that today runs rampant in the world of the child. Instead what will be left will merely be a shell of its former self, as North Lake college employees take over the many duties they once shared with their comrades-in-arms from IPL, and slave to provide at best 1/2 the service to 1/4 the patrons at 1/8 the level of competence(albeit at 2/3 the price.) Please take a moment to lament the passing of the dream that was NLCL. Alas, poor NLCL, we knew you well...
