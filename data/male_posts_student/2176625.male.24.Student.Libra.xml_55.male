She made me listen to country music last night while she cried. Tonight she is making me watch Pretty Woman. Such minimal sacrifices in order to spend time with a friend. But I like chick flicks. They are feel good movies. I still can't handle watching the Wedding Planner. It makes me think of the wedding I would be planning right now with Leslie.
