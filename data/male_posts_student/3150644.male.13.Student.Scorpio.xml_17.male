Quote 1:  A science teacher who falls under these four categories(I won't state names, but she hates durians) had a peculiar msn display name.  "When you're good to mama, mama's good to you"   Quote 2:  Now, here is my math teacher who from speed/time graphs ended up talking about the definition of accelaration in math compared to science, and concluded saying something like:   "Science teachers are redundant, and Math teachers are short and simple!"  LOL. Talk about symbolism.    Archived quote:  My math teacher again, talking about the formula of y=mx+c in relation to graphs, and he said something like "and when you do this and this...   ...the y-intercept will pop up like a baby!"    jeremi.record
