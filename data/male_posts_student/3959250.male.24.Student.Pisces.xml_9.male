I walked into Informatics school and Yen Siang directly told  me where to go to,it was Newton :) haha must thank Yen Siang for her help or else i sure more ma fan.Newton was for Intro to Computing and wah liew the class was so big....4 classes combined one leh. I saw Joie opposite and went to find her to talk.The class for HDMC was smaller but yet more cosy also lorr.  For my lesson i tot no one i knew would come liaoz in the end Doris came in and then so did Noormie and Rain..heng sia or else i sure very lonely in my class.During break and end of lesson Noormie and I went over to the other class where YC was teaching PR haha it was more fun over there lorr.Went back quite tired cos nose still blocked and its such a hassle going to the toilet at Tanjong Pagar.
