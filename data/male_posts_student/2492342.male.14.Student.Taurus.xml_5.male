How my dad exploited the gardeners, who were wage slaves to the American diehard capitlaist system. lol. and he realized for the first time i was communist. but then we were at the mall and the convo died.  Yeah, ok, so we went to the mall in woodland hills, and I was happy cause i looked like crap, my hairs too long, and im tired. Well, i was happy, cause we werent going to the mall in thousand oaks, where most people i know shop. but whatever, i see kimberly, who i ahvent seen since last year, and shes a cheerleader and shes looking fine. and im total crap. Grrreat. Then I go out and see the hottest girl ever go up the elevator. Shes like my age, and i see her walking..then she turns around up the elevator and i saw her face...*SIZZLE*..and she looked at me. but i was too ugly for her or something. wait. no. the elevator ended and she wa son the next floor.  Now, the sales lady. My dad asks this like 35 year old lady to help us, even tho im a great fashion consultant(lol)- HEy she said the outfit i said was good for mom was good too, so nuh- and she stays with us. She shows him this rabbit coat, and he says he doesnt know. shes all, she wouldnt wear the animal? and hes all, no, its him*points to me* who wouldnt like it. and shes like, look at your shoes. thats a cow. NOT COOL!!!!! Im never wearing those sandals ever again. My sister said they were ugly anyways. And lauren made fun of them. bitch. lol  Well anyways, my dads like, to the lady, shes about ur size, so she tries it on. and hes like staring at her, and gets this little pieace of the coat that got tucked in by accident thats RIGHT BY HER BOOB!!!!!! AHHH. ok. im overreacting. it was above it. but i swear, it seemed like they wouldve kissed if i wasnt there. AHHH not cool. But i mean, it could jsut be how he is. cause he thinks its still the 50's. Hes all nice to strangers, and says hi to babies. He obviously doesnt get that most mothers today would call the police if some 50-year old started playingwhind their back. lol  Crap. his birthday is the 23th. i just realized. when is that.....crap, its soon. What am i gonna get???  Oh yeah, at the end, he didnt even take the outfit i picked out. just some rabbit coat and a shirt. ugh. Then he goes downstairs and gets some leather shoes. and he makes some comment to me about them, and that just totally pissed me off. What the hell. WHY the hell would he make fun of me cause i hate killing animals for their fur?  I ate chicken again. crap.   I seriously am gonna try tho. I feel bad for the animals that died for me to have some semi-good chinese meal. nuh.  ill probably write later. i wanna dance to stacie orrico right now. since im aloooone!!!!  i downloaded 'american jesus' by bad religion. I LOVE IT!!!! i ahve no idea what the hell they mean, but oh well. YEAH!! AWSOME!!! lol  much love  peace  ~alex  PS what happened to brighton?
