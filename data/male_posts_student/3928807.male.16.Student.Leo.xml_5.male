I got a call from the camp telling me about some open house thing from 4:00 to 5:00. I went there, and it wasnt too bad. I'm in Megan Fischer's group and there's also this really hot CIT girl in our group named Cassidy. I biked home with Harrison and we made a deal to go to camp together in the mornings.   So then I get back and me and Harrison play the obligatory Super Smash Bros. Melee.I get a call from Darren just as I walk in and he wants me to come over later. So Harrison leaves at around 6:30, and Dad comes home at about 7:00. We eat Harvey's hamburgers. Then I leave to Darren's house. We sit around and listen to music/watch T.V. Mike calls, and I hear about this "ultimate weekend" thing they are doing. The Ultimate Weekend is comprised of the following: going to the CN Tower and getting ridiculously stoned. Sounds good to me. I just hope ill be able to go- since my mom is coming back on Saturday. I think i'll try and finish all the chores tomorrow so I don't have to do them on Saturday.   Hmm.. looking back, this day was far less eventful than I thought it was.
