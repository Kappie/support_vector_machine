"Back and forth I go. Up and down I move. It’s a rollercoaster that never ends. Not until I shut you out completely. My sanity comes from the belief that I can control the rollercoaster. I hear you singing your song. I see your lips moving in sync with the words you sing... I spend most of my time listening to your song. Your song compels me. My chest rises and falls with the breath of confusion that your song brings. Your verses tell of our story but your chorus I cannot hear. Certain parts come to me as if I’ve already heard the song before... the other parts I cannot hear. Just the lips moving. I just realized that I should spend more time trying to decide whether you sing the song for me or for someone else. In my dreams you don’t sing. In my dreams the words come from your pupils. We connect like two powerful magnets drawn to each other. In my dreams, all the written emotions you composed and we have shared come true. I wake up and run away from the realms of social angst.... I run to the beach and I see you there. I see you in the waves that roll in with great force only to pour back into the ocean slowly.... they remind me of the immense happiness that a single hello from you would rush me. And they also remind me of the awkward silence that draws you away from me. I follow my sand prints back to a familiar warmth that is all I know. The warmth of myself and I console my hearts pain for lack of returning emotions. In my room, I am cold now. I’ve decided to close the window because I can no longer lie to myself and see sunshine outside when it’s windy and dark. If I shut my window, my heart will wither and die. If I leave it open, my head will cut itself off from the stubborn portion that does not understand the thought process. I do not control my thoughts of you. I can’t. But you can. You show up at my window, knock on the glass and smile. I open the window hoping that the cool breeze will bring in a familiar scent that I have loved. But my head mocks my stupidity when you run away after I open the window. Where do you go? Is it so bad that you come back to play yo-yo with my heart again? If I could yell into the subliminal darkness that confuses me, I’d shout my insecurities and throw them away from me until you do not see my window again. And then the course of my rollercoaster will change. I will still go up and down... but now I’ll be down when you’re not around. And I’ll go up when you say you'll be here.... only to go down again when you leave me here, unspoken."    ooh..it was sweet..painstakingly wrote it for her...but she's gone...  (presented this for my oral english test and got a 49/50 score for it! >.
