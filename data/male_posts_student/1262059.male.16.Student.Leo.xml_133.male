When I snap my fingers, you will watch Hoshi's soccer game in the rain before visiting the art show.  Then when you hear the keywords, "today is Saturday," you will go to the anime convention and meet many people.  Now, when I clap my hands you will wake up and remember none of this.  *claps hands*  -ArV
