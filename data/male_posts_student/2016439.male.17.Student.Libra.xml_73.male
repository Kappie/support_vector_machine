Today I did a whole lot of nothing except take my car to get new back tires at Wal-Mart and pick up Mother's Day gifts.  Tomorrow I'm headin' off to Gatesville with my parents to attend church with my grandmother and then probably go out to eat with her (treat of my Dad's probably; thanks for volunteering, Pops ;-)).  This was sprung on me today, but I really don't mind.  I'll probably see some people that I haven't seen in years, which is always fun...kind of.  I don't know.  Sometimes I get a little apprehensive about revisiting people I used to be best friends with.  We'll see how that goes.  Hey!  I actually studied a bit today for my AP Gov't exam.  I love reading really bad AP essays.  They make me feel better about the fact that even if I do horribly on the exam, I couldn't quite do as bad as they did.  I know that sounds horribly rude, crude, and socially unacceptable, but that's exactly what I thought when I read this one essay in response to the question of "What factors increase and decrease a president's approval ratings?".  It said, and I quote:  "Decreases in presidental approval ratings is bad.  This can have a negative effect on their affectiveness and suvearly hurt their chances for re-election.  One cause for a decrease in approval ratings could be due to to much activity in a short period of time.  Change is hard to deal with."  Yeah, I quoted that exactly as it was written, grammar and orthographical mistakes glaringly included.  Needless to say it got a 1 (worst grade you can get except for a 0 or more humiliatingly, a dash).  I felt kind of bad, but then asked myself what the flying croiky this person was doing in an AP Government class in the first place.  My favorite phrase out of the whole essay, though, was "On the opposite side of the coin, if a President is felt to not be doing enough, this can also hurt them."  I'm so going to start saying "on the opposite side of the coin."  All right, all right.  Enough people-bashing for the day.  I must go cleanse my fingers out with antibacterial soap.  Hasta luego, mis amigos.
