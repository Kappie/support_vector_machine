Anyways, it's a cool phone...I took some pics, actually sorry their pix! I took some pix and I set it so my friends faces pop up on the phone when they call me, that's the best part about the phone. Also that I put some Rush songs onto it and now it kicks major ass. Yesterday, I got the phone. Today was Friday, is Friday and will be Friday for another hour. I went to school. Came home. Came home again. Hung out with the band and the boys without Pat because he was working. Then I went bowling with Amanda and Chris and JJ, Steve, Erica, Michelle and Danielle. Cool people ya know, they're cool. Right now, I'm ultra tired so I'm making any senz. fo weel. I'm now having a Grimaldi/Michaelis sleep over. Peace Foo.
