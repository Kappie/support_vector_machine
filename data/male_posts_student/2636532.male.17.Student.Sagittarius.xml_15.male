I prefer the imperials to the rebels. I mean think about it? What have they honestly done that’s wrong? They’re just trying to make a living!!!! And really??? So they kill a few people.... planets..... spaceships..... But I mean hey, who doesn’t??? Look at the rebellion! They wanna stick their noses into the imperial business? Go for it!!!! They pay the price! And their plan was to dominate the galaxy, yes. But think about it... What did the rebellion want to do? Destroy the empire, yes. Henceforth... controlling the galaxy!  A temper problem here... A temper problem there.... Sounds kinda like my familly actually...... Except without the devious plans...... That’s what they are! One big happy galactic familly! Spreading joy and blaster fire to all! But hey, if you’re going to succeed fully, a little bit of blaster fire is an essential part! And their so cool! Darth Vader is my hero! And if you don’t agree with me on this subject... Then  I find your lack of faith disturbing....   -Louis lol
