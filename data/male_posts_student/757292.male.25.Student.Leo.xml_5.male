Not one for standing around in the cold, I took the next available bus, which remotely travels in the area near my house, and prepare myself for the 30 minute walk ahead of me. Final destination. Exit the bus. Thank common sense for telling me to put on a sweater before leaving the house. Headphones and mini disc player on. Hood over top and jacket zipped up as far as it can go. Begin journey.  I'm not one who minds walking or even running home, especially when it's really warm out. I'll walk any distance and the people who know me well recognize the extent of this statement. There's something about traveling long distance by foot, which makes me feel alive. On a normal day I'm blessed with numerous vehicular-based modes of transportation and I never get the sense that my body is being put to good use. Walking homes changes all of that. It seems like my breathing opens up, and I love the burn as fresh air flows through my nasal cavity. Tonight the cold air made my face numb in an almost pleasurable way, and my legs were burning with pins  needles.   At the same time, my mind was churning more thoughts per minute than usual. Cutting through that empty field I could only see small islands of grass glowing under lights lining the nearby highway. Pitch black mud everywhere else as I tried to keep my feet on top of the fluffy grass. It was like a mini game during my trek.  As I entered my home sweet suburbia, my voyeuristic side was tempted. The dark streets and the interior lighting of each house made it easy to see inside the majority of the buildings. What did I observe? People really love to watch TV. What an eye-opener, huh?
