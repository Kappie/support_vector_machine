Not sure what to expect. it's somewhere in the SC mountains, and i'll be gone all weekend. I still have to pack and go to Walmart to get a couple of notebooks for school, which starts Monday. Oi. Really depressing night last night. Can't say too much, my mom will probably read this. that sucks, I'm no longer free to write anything I want. damn. that REALLY sucks. Anyway, still got some stuff to do, gotta go.
