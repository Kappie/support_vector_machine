I do have to praise Legacy, but the quality of play by the Avs was poor.  Also, Koharski made what was probably the worst non-call in years.  The Avs goalie clearly had the puck cradled in his chest and looked for a whistle, but our favorite ref wouldn't give it to him.  In the ensuing scramble, the Wings got a CHEAP goal.  What a lousy, stupid, game-outcome-effecting non-call!  If I were a Wing's fan (God stike me down), I'd be ashamed of that goal.  Too bad.  I hope it's a better game on Saturday.
