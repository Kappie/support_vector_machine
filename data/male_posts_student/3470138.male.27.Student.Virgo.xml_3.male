I remember one thing in particular from a very bad Johnny Depp movie called Don Juan Dimmarco, and it was this quote in a roundabout way:  "Every woman is a world unto herself.  Each woman is beautiful.  You must look for that beauty sometimes, but it is there.  Women love me because I can see that beauty, becasue I know they are beautiful and can tell them as such."  Or it was something like that.  Anyway, I've found this to be true.  Every woman is beautiful just l;ike every man is good in some way, all thats needed is the patience to see it.  It's very hard to do.  But once you get the hang of it, it'll be hard not to fall in love with every woman you meet, and expect the best out of the worst of guys.
