Operation Dumbass 1(for purposes of ease, "Plan D") is still highly classified, so I can't really discuss what happened, but if you're in on that loop, then you'll have some idea of whats goin on. I'm still a little freaked after the catastrophe that was Plan D, but Plan D2 is in a different city, with different people, so maybe it'll go differently.   Anyway... you prolly think im crazy now. Or a dumbass. Prolly justified...  So exams haven't gone near as bad as i thought they would, but i have math and physics next, and i'm freaking out, man. Like, im freaked to the point that i just wanna go up and hug someone and whimper.  Sorry, don't have a whole lot to post. Between exams, Operation Dumbass 2, and hackey-sack, i've not had any time to do anything or think anything, and as Plan D2 is top-level classification, and exams and hackey-sack aren't much to talk about, you're just SOL.
