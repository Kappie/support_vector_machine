It has ritual, religion and it is to appease the God of vengeance. This society accuses the Aztecs of human sacrifice when they practice human sacrifice in virtually every state in the Union.  ~ Russell Means ... June 2, 1997  People always worship gods, almost always unwillingly.  As I told someone "It's easier to just have faith in yourself, it's not to hard." That's where the "light" is anyway.
