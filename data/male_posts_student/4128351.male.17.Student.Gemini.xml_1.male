I stayed up reading Orwell's  1984  for the second time and drinking No Pulp Orange Juice.  Brice doesn't like pulp, I think he's a pussy.  It doesn't matter to me, all OJ is good.       I played guitar for awhile.   #34  is pretty damn hard to play.  It's easy, but it's hard to get it to sound right.  I don't know, maybe I just suck.      We drove to Cincy and got 900 garden mums.  What fun, me being in the back of a Ryder truck for hours.  It sucked big goat testicles.      I miss my girlfriend.  :(    I'm going to go get a shower and then go to Pimp's B-Day Party with Brice and Vickers.  It'll probably suck.  I might start going out with a new girl there, that's where I usually date my girls, the Thompson house.        I'm going to run though, I'll holler back at you later.      Peace.
