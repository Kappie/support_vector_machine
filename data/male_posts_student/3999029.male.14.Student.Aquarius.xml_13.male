Also I changed one of the questions' answer when I found out from my friends that I was wrong. Sorry for that but I can't afford to lose 10 marks for the test. Also, there is going to be comprehension test tomorrow. I hate such tests as I usually score very badly in them. Flower fucker power, yeah! You can put a flower in front of her and she will be focused onto that flower and thus would completely become your slave. Then you can slaughter her, juz like Bastard Zhang. Hahahaha.  I still have both the history and geog tests on Thursday plus ting xie on Wed. It's gonna kill me. Still praying for a postpone of test dates, esp for geog. I still don noe when is the lit and maths test. Shit, die. I tink the reason flower always take leave is because the seedsare injured and require special attention. They are very vulnerable to mortality and may die easily. Anyway, I am still looking foward to national day, Guan Jie Jie and Yappy. Gay pub and babara is bi-sexual. LOL  Found a new blog: http://booooooooooo.blogspot.com, I think a motherfucker created it. He is hong hui's friend. I think that he should go home and fuck himself. Nothing much to say anymore, some ppl are still having serious attitude problems and I don give a damn.
