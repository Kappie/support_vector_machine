Me and Matt are trying to make plans for fall break, I want to go to a place neither of us have been b/c it's a lot cooler than comparing what you've seen before when you can experience the thing for the first time and talk about it. I really want to go to Boston b/c neither of us have been there and it seems like an awesome place. I always wanted to live in Michigan, but I used to think that i'd like to live somewhere like NYC, but that is way too busy for me and expensive... so something in between the two would be cool. I really think I would like living in Massachussetts. The only place I can see myself living in the future is up north somewhere. I hate jade sometimes.    Ok, to further the point i'm trying to make if i can, I really wanna have a story to tell when I come back to Mississippi for visits, I now think that it would be an awesome story to talk about boston and harvard and all that good stuff, it seems like living the life of a Kennedy. LOL. I really think Matt and I could live there and actually be able to have a normal life. It snows there, that is a plus and you are near the coast, well right on it. Comfortably Numb is an awesome song, people should listen to it every day.. at least once. I wonder sometimes if i'll ever get outta this state.. I don't belong here!!! I really feel like my life hasn't begun yet, but it's going to soon hopefully. Well, it's 12:21 and matt is wanting rice so i better go try and cook. I hope this blog was very insightful and meaningful. Good-night. Jennifer, please don't comment on any of this!
