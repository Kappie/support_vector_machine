And wasn't let go until I couldn't take my bad odor and proceeded to shower. Eww! (I know) but after all that loss of sleep it took a big hit on me this morning and I missed going to school for the 3rd time. I got to tell ya, 8-ball along with chatting to the other player at the same time is really cool and then the fear of losing your credits adds to the addictiveness (I got $2.00 remaining from the $5.00)
