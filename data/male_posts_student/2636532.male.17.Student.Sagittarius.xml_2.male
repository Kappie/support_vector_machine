It's just like riding a bike for the very first time...well replace the bike with my computer...and the road/parking lot/driveway with the World Wide Web. But all in all it's generally the same feeling, well that is until you inevitably fall off your bike and crash into a tree thus terrifying you of ever riding a bike or any other form of transportation that involves wheels...ah screw bikes, I never did like them anyways, to much of a pain in the ass. But anyways I'll try to put blogs up as much as i can depending on my time and how much i feel like bitching. Peace Out! -Matt
