Take that hotmail! From my basement, I stab at thee!   Wow. I just think I used more exclamation marks in the above than most modern novels do. That obviously shows I am at the forefront of some new writing style, one that will bring the literary world to its knees. If you thought that piffle Joyce had talent, just wait for Tyson!  See I just did it again. Look at how much better things are with in the brand new Tyson style of writing:  Boring current style - I went to the store.  Super Awesome Tyson Style - I WENT TO THE STORE TO GET SOME CHEESE! OH YEAH! THE CHEESE WAS GREAT AND I WON THE LOTTERY! SWEET!  I think we can easily tell the better of the two. But onto bigger and better things.  Prom was last weekend. All I can say is that I enjoyed it thoroughly, even though I feel like a douche because I may have made her cry - despite assurances by a close friend  and herself that she had a good time. Despite the obviously romantic conotations that go along with the late night walk through Loose Park, I do not think it went in that direction. Once again, all's I will  say is that it was a great time indeed and I hope thats a mutual feeling. Don't take my silence as meaning something happened. I simply don't feel the need to recount the night bit by bit.   Speaking of a close friend - I almost did something that would have driven her away. She thought I was rejecting advances from her she though that I thought I percieved, but I was merely trying to find out if the advances existed. I am much to selfish to be put into a relationship where one would rely on me, and I would possibly kill myself if I failed and ended up hurting her. But everything's cool now, I hope. In fact, I'm using her as inspiration for the betterment of this blog. I fidn myself wanting to at least put it some some modicum of use beyond my own indulgence. But I am not so arrogant or confident to post poetry and the like, as then I would be forced to write poetry. But I do find it somewhat disconcerting that many people have no knowledge of event beyond our own state, let alone country. So, starting whenever I feel like it, I will begin linking importanat news around the world - the boring yet important  stuff. As for my inspiration, I also find I tend to be a wealth of depressing informaton, so I hereby dedicate a section to the new "Emma's Good News Journal" to show people that the world isn't so bad. To start, I was originally going to do it in paper form, but now I decided to do it here - so I already saved trees! Go me! Lets begin!   Boring, yet Important   Today we focus on the news lite. If you have not heard about what is going on currently in Hong Kong than you truly are no follower of world events. But it is important none the less. Hong Kong, which was handed over to China in 1997, has finally run into the friction of clashing political systems that was destined to come despite the "One Country, Two Systems" promise. The People's Republic of China has slowly begun to flex its control more and more, and now they have officially announced there will be no direct elections in 2007. A  people's democracy is no longer needed in Hong Kong. Read about it  urlLink here .  Undestandably, this has caused some more friction between east and west - namely the USA and UK.  For the USA the crushing of democracy will always bring criticism, and yet another bone besides Taiwan to pick. Even with the current fights in the WTO, nothing truly inflammatory will spew fourth - simply because of the USA's desire to maintain the status quo in the region. But the UK is another story. The UK feels no small loyalty to Hong Kong, and is actively criticising the moves of China. China, for its part, has  urlLink lashed back  in a bitter condemnation of the farce the UK called democracy that used to exist in Hong Kong.   What does this all mean? Its hard to tell, but it should show that the Central Committee is getting scared. More and more entrepenuers are popping up in China everyday, and discriminating against millionares is hard when more keep coming. Many local companies are operating with only one party member on the board -  alone, no longer dominating company action. Hong Kong, though a shining example of an Asian Dragon economy wise may prove to be a pandora's box if not contained. So the Committee will crush western style democracy there before it can spread. A short, mediocre analysis. But all I have patience for. I find this reverse reunificaton of the Germany's fascinating, as though the economic prosperity is much more clear in this newer example, the political ramfications in one of the most important countries in the world are incredibly murky and possibly not good. We can only hope that the Conservative faction of the Party does not use Hong Kong as a invite for a knee jerk reaction against the Parties' more liberal elements, thus sending China back to an earlier time politically. And yes, I do understand the irony in characterizing the incredibly radicaly communist sections of the party as conservatve and the ones more open to capitalistic democracry as liberal.   Emma's Good News Journal   -One of Saddam Hussein's many sadistic punishments was to cut off the right ear of Iraqi men who were deemed to be traitors. An estimated 3,600 Iraqis lost their ears that way. But the newly formed National Iraqi Association for the Defense of Human Rights is now paying for reconstructive surgery for those victims who want it. Khalid Abid Nimer, 33, was one of the first beneficaries. "It feels so good to be able to walk around on the street again and not be embarassed," he said, after kissing his doctor on the cheek. "I'm reborn."  -Apr. 22 - The number of Americans driving hybrid cars jumped more than 25 percent in one year, a trend that is expected to continue because of high gas prices and automakers' plans for more hybrid models. There were 43,435 U.S. registrations for hybrid vehicles last year, a 25.8 percent increase from 2002, according to figures from R.L. Polk  Co., the Southfield-based firm that collects and interprets automotive information. California had the most registrations for vehicles with environmentally friendly gasoline-electric hybrid engines, followed by Virginia, Florida and Washington.

The Environment Agency and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) found that a plant scale trial using TPP (tetraphenylphosphonium bromide) to remove Tc-99 from liquid waste was highly successful and approved BNFL to start implementing the system immediately.
