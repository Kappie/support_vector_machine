It's not hard, it was just time consuming.  Well, I went to do it on Lynda's computer and since I know what I'm doing, I do it really fast.  So before she knew anything, I was done and said this is what you do and this is where you go.  I confused her and she wanted it back the way it was.  I explained I can't do that since Garry told me to do it this way.  I then explained to her that shared files go on the H drive and personal files go on the F drive.  She didn't want the whole staff seeing the files she shares with Lori and wanted me to change it back the way it was.  I told her I can't change it back, because "back" wasn't the way she's thinking.  The files she though were private before weren't private.  They were public on everyone's computers.  So she got frustrated and said she wanted the shared files she put up put into her private folder.  So I showed her and she moved them.  I told Garry that I was all set and she moved the files to her private area.  He didn't like that.  He looked at me and said "Move them back." in a very angry tone.  Ugh.  If she doesn't want files out in public, why can't she keep them private?  Whatever, so I went back to Lynda and said "You're not gonna like this... I need to move them back to the shared folder."  So after making her mad and making Garry mad, I went back to my office.  Ugh, why do they put me in the middle of their rivalry?  What did I ever do to them? :)
