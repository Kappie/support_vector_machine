Maybe Schlitterbahn on Friday, when I grab my emergency cash loan that will sate me until the loan fundage comes in.  Bills are paid for this month, and now I've just got to skid by on my cash, so a few more days of watching movies and playing with my nephew, all the while dodging West Nile, sounds like the best plan.  And it makes my mom happy.    Winged Migration was incredible.  Gets kind of dull at parts because it's much of the same thing, but watching that movie, you envy the life of a bird because the bird can see the world.  Of course, you don't envy the scavenger life of birds, and how to break a wing is to be dead.    Also caught Jerry Magurie on TNT last night...good film, gets me back into the writing mode on both of my projects...he has that decision point of making the world a better place quite early in the movie, and the rest of the movie deals with the ramifications of that decision to be closer to fewer clients.  Interesting set-up.  Plus, Renee Zellweger doesn't look like an emaciated chipmunk here...she's still got some sexy going on at this point in the career.    Sun comes out for just a few minutes a day now, with lots of marine layer and thundershowers.  Tan not commenced.  Red tide washes dead fishies onto the sand.  Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?
