But for some reason, when he installed the smoke detector on the second floor (where my room is) he put it in the hallway directly outside of the bathroom door.  So whenever someone takes a shower, once you open the door, all the steam rolls out and sets off this smoke detector.  And sometimes it doesn't set it off, and there is usually a delay that is long enough for me to get into my room and get partially changed before it starts sqwuaking, and I have to run down the hall and press the reset button.  That just seems like bad placement.
