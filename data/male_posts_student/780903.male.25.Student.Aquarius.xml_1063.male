Request #3 comes from Matt, who asks for "I want you to write [an entry] entitled "If I Ran the Harvard Law School," in the spirit of Dr. Seuss's "If I Ran the Zoo" and "If I Ran the Circus."  Do it in Seussian rhyme, and tell us what you would change about HLS if you were suddenly made Dean."  Well, I asked for it, so I guess I can't complain. I'll do my best, or at least my best given that I'm hungry and want to go eat some lunch pretty soon.   If I Ran The Harvard Law School   If I ran the Harvard Law School There would not be any grades All the dorms would be gigantic And be cleaned by comely maids All the classes would be shorter And there'd always be free snacks There would be no class required And we would not offer Tax My admissions process revamp Would include an interview The tuition would be lowered The school year would be shortened too All the faculty with tenure Would have no more guarantees I would hasten global warming So the winters would not freeze I would mandate legal ethics I would kill the law review I would paint the buildings colors Maybe yellow, maybe blue I would make the dining service Something edible, at least And each year, on some day special There would be a giant feast Where the faculty would mingle With the students and the staff We would be one happy family God forbid, someone might laugh I would banish all the law firms There would be no jobs to seek But if course if I did that We would be closed within a week.
