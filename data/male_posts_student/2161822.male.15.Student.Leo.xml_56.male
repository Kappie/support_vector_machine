Beside the fact that it was dark and I couldn't see the person 5 feet to my right and the fact that I was afraid for my life to step in the center of the floor, I loved it. The song listing was great and they were all performed just like the actual song. It was great. Plus the originals were awesome. The two songs I was impressed with most though were the last two. System Of A down - Toxicity, and Metro. Wow. You should have come just to see those two songs. But the whole thing was great. Next time you guys should come. You'll have a good time.  Listen to H.I.M.
