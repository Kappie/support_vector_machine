Dropped by the airport early in the week and was once again reminded of why I once enjoyed that place. No other place I know where it is both crowded and yet has quiet places, has wide open-spaces and yet have long empty winding corridors. Helps that it opens till late and is only a quick bus ride from home and back. However there are some sad memories that may have kept me away, but I understand that there are good ones as well. Things are changing.      >     Speaking of change, my congrads to  Iris  for taking a huge step of faith in both heart and mind. All the best and perhaps more of us could benefit in taking similar steps as well :)      >     I had a good afternoon meeting up with my old friend  LdyRne  earlier in the week as well. We finally caught a movie after such a long time, which was kinda awkward since we were like almost the only adults in the theater and was surrounded by school kids on all sides since we had center seats. Remind me not to get tickets of an afternoon show for an animated movie after school exams again.  We adjourned nearby for tea, and while it took some time to get going, we had an enjoyable conversation. I'm glad that our friendship has come to such a point. Like I mentioned to someone earlier, I'm not the type to burn bridges and would try to keep friends as much as I can. We have both grown much and it makes things new as well as keeping the familiarity that have already been established. It also helps that she looked great that day! Makes me hope that I had asked to take a photo or that she would agree to it. Man I hope she's reading this, or all that energy spent keeping tongue-in-cheek would have been for naught :)      >     Speaking of which, there are quite a few people I need to catch up with.  Ebb Tide  is back in town and, God willing, she can find time to get back to me. Somehow I don’t think I should hold my breath about it though.   MchlWng  is finally on holidays, I think. She deserves it I feel, whatever the case may be. Hope to be able to see her; she’s always a joy to hang out with. Pity that we do that rarely.  Then there are my classmates. Sounds strange I know since I see them almost everyday, but I rarely get to spend time with them outside of school. For example, they were up in JB a few days back and I wasn’t able to attend. Another reason is that our modules will be different come next term thus I won’t be able to see them as much.  Last but not least are  NcoWng  and the rest of my NS understudies. They will be ORDing soon and thus they owe me a dinner treat  *grins*    Hmm…maybe I should get around to dropping the rest of the people on my Friendster friends list testimonials, good way to get them to write for me too. If friendster is working that is. Maybe get them to read this blog too. And with that, I have brought all this post back full circle.   Have a good week!
