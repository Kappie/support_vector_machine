Nevertheless I thought it was a really fun place to be, whether I was working or just wanted some food. I was only there for 3 or 4 months but I still met some really cool people that hopefully I'll stay friends with. AJ, Matt, Matt, Kristen, Daniella, Emma, Tracy, Ben, David, Justin: peace. It's been fun.  -alex
