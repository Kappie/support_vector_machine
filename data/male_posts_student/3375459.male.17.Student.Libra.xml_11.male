I'm just a stupid, selfish guy who isn't fit to like anyone. Ok, thats all.... i should be getting back to my oldself right about now.   Two more day till the grades are out and work. OUh! so execited. I'm getting to partner Desmond again, xin ku ta le(poor him). Hopefully, he doesn't make any last minute changes. Still remember last year, i was being blame for getting to check the stuff on the second floor just because i'm tall and huge. Though the work is dusty(still ok with me), but i like the part where by after we finished our rounds, we can sit together in a huge gang to chat and wait 4 the next set of list to come. But this year, sad to say. Seem like alot of my frineds aren't coming, not all is lost. we can still have a small group chat among ourselves. Besides, we'll get to see girls. *nose bleeding* But before that, I must try to recall the sections. If not I'm going to get nags from Desmond again.  Sigh~  later!
