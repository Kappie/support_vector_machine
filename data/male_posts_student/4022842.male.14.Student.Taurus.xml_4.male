The incompletion; love. I am unloved. I know I'm repeating myself here (yesterday's entry) and I'm not gonna apologise for that.   Yesterday, as I was getting dressed after a shower, I looked myself in the mirror and asked myself "Am I happy living my life? Can I carry on? Do I need love to make my life complete?" And the answers were (In that order) "No, Yes and Yes". So, all you Einstein's out there should've figured out that I'm not happy living my life, I can carry on, and I DO need love in my life.   "I am not happy living my life," yeah tha's true. Why? Because I am incomplete, that is the worst feeling I've had to date. And what makes it worse, is that I cannot express my true feelings to anyone, I'm one of those people who, if they were crying (example), the ONLY way somebody would be able to tell is by my tear stained face. What makes matters worse, is that I have nobody that will let me lean on their shoulder, because nobody in my life loves me.   "I can carry on". But why? For my family? For my friends? "There's plenty of fish in the sea"? "There will be someone". No. None of those. I carry on, because I have the determination to prove everyone that makes me feel like shit wrong. I can become successful, I will become successful, and I will do it if it kills me.  "I DO need love in my life." Of course I do. Everyone does. It's a normal feeling. The only time I've not felt like this was when I thought "love is icky and so are girls", But that's normal for any 5 year old boy, I guess..   I would love nothing more than to have 1 person that would let me cry on their shoulder. I would love it more than anything in the world. I would love nothing more than to let someone cry to me and tell me why they are unhappy.   I've been told, by someone, "love stabs you in the back", so my first reaction would be "Then that's not real love", but then I heard "Love is a cold monster that traps you and won't let you go", and I put 2+2 together. Love is a backstabbing, monster that traps you and won't let you escape, but I'm at that time in my life, when I'm ready to take that chance and experience it for myself. As for other people... Nobody is ready to take me on, give me a chance, which makes me feel like shit.       Well, Peace      Paul ...
