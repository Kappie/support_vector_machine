Ummm... in continuation, staying up late online so people would stop calling me so late on the landline... *mutter*darned stupid people*mutter* and getting me in trouble for talking to people I shouldn't talk to and studying div layering and iframes. Nakuha ko na rin how basic div layering works. I used it in the JPIA site. I don't get it. How come when it's a site for someone else, Making a layout takes so little time but when it's my personal site, I hit a brick wall. Maybe it's the money.   I'm supposed to go to a screening for image modeling for the brochure in our school tomorrow afternoon but I rather doubt I'll get it coz my eyebags are so dark by now. Ha ha!
