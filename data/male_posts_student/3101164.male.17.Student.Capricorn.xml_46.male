To Abe, Vito, or whoever the fuck else is putting that shit in people's chatters I have something to say. Why are we fighting? Is there really any reason? I mean we are all friends here and we dont need to act like children. So in short I am asking you to stop with all of the childish bullshit. Also to Abe I apologize for what I did on the phone last night.  >>
