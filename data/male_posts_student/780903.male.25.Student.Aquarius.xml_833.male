I like the 3-hour variety best, just because it's shorter.  All 3 of my exams this semester are 8-hour varieties, next Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (fun week).  I'd like to lobby for a new variety:  The 39-day Exam Survivor Challenge  DAY 1: They blindfold the class and take us on a boat, with just the clothes on our back (and our laptops with wireless Internet).  We sail to a remote outpost of Madagascar and disembark, where we are faced with an instant elimination challenge.  10 multiple choice questions about the federal rules of evidence.  The bottom 10% get C's and are fed to the piranhas.  The rest of us are given some tools and told to build a big teepee.  This will be our home for the next 38 days, or until we are eliminated.   --more tomorrow--
