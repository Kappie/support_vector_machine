So I guess that means that  urlLink NOFX , Alkaline Trio, and Jello Biafra in Irvine was the west coast part of the tour and this will be the east coast part. I really look forward to seeing Randy and their Swedish socialist rock goodness.  So I had the brilliant idea that it might be cool to format my hard drive and reinstall Windows since it was running super slow. However, when I was doing it, I accidently screwed up the partition on my external drive (with all my MP3s). The files are still recoverable, but I just need to get a program that fixes partitions...  At least my computer  is  running faster.  According to Brandon, parts of my last post will be turned into the song "Ticking Away." Maybe I should make more posts that use big words, so that he can turn them into Graffin-esque songs. Some big words that I like are epistemology, nomothetic, idiographic, teleology, manifestation, materialism, um... what else?  My family has never been into doctors, despite when I was really young... them encouraging me to be one. However this  urlLink story . Cracks me up... I could totally see myself doing something like that. However, I'm sure there's a lack of doctors in Iraq with stuff like  urlLink this  happening all the time. I'm not super activist or anything, but the lack of medical expertise in many parts of the world is scary. The fact that they have to airlift people in remote locations to the nearest big city for surgery must be a realy bitch.  Ok I better get on that write up for today's class readings now.  **
