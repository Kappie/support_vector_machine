Oh yeah, when i played my last game of  Homeworld II , i was listening to  Valhalla  from the  Valkyrie Profile  arranged album, and the music fitted perfect with my fight scene. Awesome!   Actionplant  forums seems to be working properly now, last time i tried to log on i had problems. The new skins are awesome, i did myself a new avatar and a new sig for the occasion.   2 weeks before the launch of  Tutorial Central , well it's not the official name anymore but it's still gonna be awesome.   Well i guess i'm off to finish my game of Homeworld II.  Regards,  Zephyr
