There's a pain, goes on and on... Empty chairs at empty tables, Now my friends are dead and gone.  Here they talked on revolution. Here, it was, they lit the flame. Here they sang about tomorrow, But tomorrow never came.  From the table in the corner They could see a world reborn. And they rose, with voices ringing. And I can hear them now, The very words that they had sung Become their last communion On the lonely barricade, At dawn.  Oh, my friends, my friends, forgive me That I live and you are gone, There's a greif that can't be spoken, There's a pain goes on and on...  Phantom faces at the window, Phantom shadows on the floor, Empty chairs at empty tables, Where my friends will meet no more...  Oh, my friends, my friends.... Don't ask me What your sacrifice was for! Empty chairs at empty tables, Where my friends will sing no more.   Empty Chairs at Empty Tables   from   Les Mis√©rables   Love, Jon Roskilly
