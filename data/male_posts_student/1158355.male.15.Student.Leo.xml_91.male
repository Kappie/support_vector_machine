Then my aunt put me through misery and pain by popping a blackhead, she's obsessed with looks. The thing wasn't even big...she said girls care so I allowed her to do it. THEN, I forced my mom to bring me to blockbuster because I was in pain. Haha slave mommy...kinda like clone baby. Don't ask why I capitalized THEN, I don't even know why I did that. Ya, the King's Park blockbuster is alot better than Smithtown's. Splinter Cell wasn't at Smithtown's but it was at King's Park and King's Park has a million more games and it looks alot nicer. Ya anyways Splinter Cell kicks ass. Today I hung out with Mike and Matt, went into town, saw the Cuccinellos, had pizza and Italian ices, saw that same gay little 10 year old and he again started with us, we ignored him. But if he does it again, I'm going to smash his fucking head in. I hate little kids who think their so tough and cool. Well I hate anyone who thinks their tough and cool. Heaton bought a Darth Maul figure...I don't know why. So we went back to my house, they watched me play Splinter Cell, Mike left because he biked to my house and had to get back before dark...he made it by a few hours IDIOT!!! and I gave Matt drum lessons until his momma came.Ok I'm bouncin'...piece foo.  Please take time to read this.  Last night I was stayed up till 4 playing Splinter Cell and chatting on the computer, I couldn't last any longer and I passed out on my bed. In my dream I could barely keep my eyes open and I was extremely tired, and I felt it. I felt it all. I felt it just as I felt it before and after dreaming. In my dream, I was laying on a couch calling out for Neo who was sitting on the coach across from me, a coffee table seperating us. I was holding a book, kinda like a comic book or magazine and it had a green flashing eye on it. I dropped the book, stopped calling out for Neo and fell asleep on the couch in my dream. That's all I can remember but as Tool said "I'm slipping into a dream within a dream." Lately I've been having weird dreams of either nuclear wars (with funny random endings RIGHT CRYSTAL HAHA, waking up and thanking god to see a blue sky, green grass and a guy mowing the lawn), robots killing us all, or us taking them over. I saw it all, I was a slave in one dream, I lost my family in all of them, the tragedy was to its fullest. Either way I saw it all, the death, the innocent flesh scattered throughout our world in red. Our world at its greatest doom. It's almost like it's inevitable to happen. These dreams might scare you but accept the fact, it just might be our future. Don't laugh, don't make fun. Know you're dreams are your best friend. Listen to them, they might help you.
