That guy thinks a lot about life and how he inteprets the happenings around his life is indeed very interesting. In shorter words: everything is probably from his soul. Me? I’m a gutless, soulless, Russian-trained clown who has no emotions. This blog is effectively a place for me to get rid of tensions, which is why a majority of the posts before this centered on anger, frustration, depression, death and doomsday ( er, all true save the last two ). I am a happy-go-lucky person. And when I say lucky, I mean very, very lucky. Life has been generous to me. Or should I say Allah? Hmm...  1997 : Fusion16 enrols in an international school at a god forsaken city called Colombo in Sri Lanka. His parents could chosen to send him to an American one which was far away, but decided to settle on a British one – closer to home. It so happened that the blogger (that’s me) failed – or did badly – in an entrance exam and was enrolled in a lower class. How does that make me lucky? Well, that year was the only year which lacked a potential future Sri Lankan prime minister. So, who gets the top job and the honour of being the first ever foreign Head Boy?  Me . ( Insert cynical laugh here !)  2001 : Fusion16 gets his bum into the scout den with hopes of becoming a top scout. Never gets past his Tenderfoot test and quits. Joins Kadet Remaja Sekolah a few months later.  Lucky?  Well, KRS happens to be one of the more “inactive” uniformed units around. No work, no play, nothing. More free Saturdays for me! ( Raise eyebrows here !)  2004 : Fusion16 is miraculously in the debate team. He is blessed with a brilliant third-speaker and a shining Scottish-born first speaker.  Lucky?  Gee, their Sri Lankan bred second-speaker rides along and gets a piece of whatever they earn for cryin’ out loud! ( Insert another cynical laugh here !)  Still in 2004 : Fusion16 shoots up to the top post in KRS.  Lucky?  Very, very lucky. Why? Coz' there aren't anymore seniors around, no more Malay leaders who have gone off to MRSM, and look, it’s that same clown who’s suddenly inherited a whole bunch of stuff. ( Don’t have to laugh cynically here, just grin maliciously )  So, the conclusion is? I am one hell of a lucky son-of-a-gun and I intend to stop that from happening. Makes you feel uneasy wondering when all this graciousness will end. Fusion16 now officially proclaims his desire to try his utmost best to get something ( well, anything ) based on his OWN merit! Well, actually, being lucky ain’t that bad, come to think of it (;P) Thank you great God. I’ll repay you in any way you see fit if I get upstairs ( or even downstairs, for that matter ) when I die. ( Insert the final cynical laugh here!)
