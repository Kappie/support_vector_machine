WWWWAAAAHHRRRRRRRRRGHHHHHH~~!!       there... better..   as you can probably tell by now, i do not start with such titles and lines at the start of a normal blog. i will most probably talk about heavier stuff as its the night and i am in a totally horrible mood. if you do not like vulgar saysings.. im sorry i will probably let loose alot within this single blog. if you do not like heavier topics too, i advise u to skip itor look away.. that saying i do not care if you like wat you read, its you choice to be a responsible reader yourself (e.g dun go to porn sites if you dislike porn, sorry this is the best and easiest example i can think of now.)   yes i am pissed off.  ROYALLY   pissed off. diss me now and i swear i will most probably break your nose at least.Or hunt you down andtorture you.this is seriously not the time to mess with me, espcially im swearing at cursing at EVERY single thing right now.. from the day's happenings to my computer...   DIE YOU GOD DAMNED S.O.B TROJANS... I WILL SEARCH YOU OUT AND ERASE YOU LIKE THE INSIGNIFICANT DATA YOU ARE.. DATA AS COURRPTED TO THE CORE LIKE YOU DESERVES TO BE BURNED BY SOME CYBER FORMATTING WAVE AND ROT IN DIGITAL HELL.. IF I COULD ENTER MY COMPUTER I WOULD GO IN THERE RIGHT NOW AND DEREZ YOUR SORRY EXTENTIONS. MARK MY WORDS. (wat it means is simply burn by some flames of judgement and rot in hell.. if i could personally attack you now i would kill your sorry asses.. word for word, yep.)   yea im sad too. very very sad. but.. of course my day had some great happenings.. those not as great eventually took its toll on me.. better count my blessings later.   good stuff first then. i will also be teaching how to do some NORMAL maintainence on people's computer.. since you ppl really dunno wat u are getting into.. and allu ppl can do is complain complain AND complain that your com is spoilt when u urself dunno how to care for it. (it gets very  annoying at times.) i used my com for nearly 5 years and it is coming along fine.. i really dun understand. (the only times it is spoilt is when OTHER people use it, very nice huh.)   so thank me and hail me as watever you want.   ok onto theserious part. happy stuff first... lets see now.. my good friend since p5 came to stay over last nite.. yep.. we played kof till like the wee hours of the morning.. it was damn fun man.. hahaha.. (Cheers yang feng =P) and of course.. today i visited city harvest church.. its a very nice place.. pretty cool.. and their service is more like a concert or something.. (no offense you guys) which is actually pretty cool.. no wonder it attracts younger ppl =P i think thats about it.. (pretty sad huh?)   now to computers... please... make your life better.. uninstall kazaa.. that piece of shit deserves digital hell, honest. stop surfing funny sites and have quick reflexes.. close pop up windows  FAST .. i have 2 precious websites for you still-ignorant-of-cyber-danger people.. it contains general fixes.   DISCLAIMER: I will  not  be responsible if anything bad happens to your computer by running such software. i personally used it and it worked fine for me. I am assuming you have at least some  common  sense and basic clicking knowledge before knowing what should be deleted and wat not by now. I also do not earn any royalties from 'promoting' these websites and their respective handwritten programs.. It is to merely help you combat cyber-dangers of the present and to help save your poor computers.   first:  urlLink http://www.merijn.org/index.html   ok... who knows what is'broswer hijack'?    .....    no one?  tch.. fine.. well.. if you suddenly find your homepage some porn page, some search engine.. or something that is NOT your normal or set homepage.. then congrats, you been -insert above term + -ed to it- also if you find weird and funny bars popping below your address bar (the place where you enter your URLs to go around the net) then the same applies.   go there.. and get the app(lication) called   hijack this!  ,  then jus run the app and thenthe 'scan' option..jus choose to remove everything unless you have the time to go through like 100+results or if you do not know wat the results mean.. most probably u jus need to redo some settings and if you dunno wat it means, usually you wont make customizations that would be affected by destroying every singlesearch result.. download the other apps if you want and ifu know how to use them, fine with me too. (if you do not, do some self-directed learning please.. i am not gonna babysit you all the time.)   second:  urlLink www.lavasoftusa.com   know wat a pop up is? its when those irritating small windows keep jumping up when u are surfing normally.. usually pop ups like casinos and porn and what not.. or some free thing.. (which is not free at all!)   ok.. this contains a nice free (and not free) program called ad-ware.. jus go here and download the free one.. you can look through the options if you want too, but directly selectingscan directlyis fine too.. once u have all the search results..right-click and select 'select all results' and jus promptly delete them off.this will remove alot of spyware from your com which is a bad bad thing.. jus trust me on this.. you wouldn't want this on your computer.   still having browser hijacks and pop ups? well these programs target general ones.. if you still have such problems.. i really dunno wat porn u ppl surf -.- u could try other spyware destroyers or manually hunt them down (like me). Alternatively.. look down somemore :)  lastly:  urlLink www.hardwarezone.com   select the singapore portal when u go here.. (its at the top left) and go to the forums.. read around and if you still have any queries.. jus post and ask NICELY.. most likely some kind soul will help you.. please be nice even if you have a bad mood.. i cant stress this enough as alot of ppl hate disrespectful ppl.. usually there is some fix for some problem in some place at such a forum.   there.. now to the not-so-nice part of my day.. i wont blabber too much.. as i do not really go into detail with my stuff.. basically.. yinlun sure pissed me off today by coming to my place.. (and doing something real bad) it is simply, im so f***ing tired.. and he still disturbs me, very rudelyi must add, and all sorts. service at church..i honestly dislike service, reasons.. please do  not  ask. i wont tell you and its really personal so dun waste your time. i appreciate it alot, thank you. and something else happened between me and another... 'person'. really saddened me alot to hear such things..   anyway... im really extremely tired these days.. so tired.. but im not tired now.. got alot of stuff to play and whack.. destress lol. so when i fell asleep and yinlun came to disturb (yes really disturb me, i dont often use this word so its pretty serious) me.. it really irritated me alot. also.. when i returned home and used my com. .(jus started using) alot more of the stupid trojans and spyware came up.. i really have NO IDEA WAT THE HELL HE SURFS, every SINGLE time he uses my com many problems surface.. my sister is also another 'virus', i swear she is onechunk of corrupted data! argh~ someone save my soul!!!   the final straw was about 11pm when i was on the phone with someone, YES IT IS A FEMALE SO STOP ASKING. she really disappointed me alot.. but at least she tries her best to make up for it, so i appluad her for being very sincere to me. (i not arrowing you and i not angry at you so please do not worry k? =P)   really.. alot of ppl do not know wat they can do and how much they can affect ppl's lives.. so next time.. jus try to make the world a better place ok? at least  she  knows and she is trying to be nice to ppl, poor abused ppl like me, and so i am very happy with her and also try not to put her in a difficult position, i jus accepted her offer gratefully and graciously. of course ill be more than happywith the new arrangement too ^^ i prefer it to the old arrangement actually. (jus telling u lah)   i think it should suffice for today.. i want to go play le.. i want to whack and kill ppl.. =X let all the steam out.. also got an important phonecall at 6-7+ in the morning 2moro.. i want to make sure i pick it up ^^ so i gonna sign sign off now!   P.S : Did you know i only have one pathetic packet of milo to accompany me now? I miss my tau hua =X~  P.P.S : I'm also feeling very depressed and lonely right now? I also do not feel like doing my project 2moro...   P.P.P.S : i added a ex-classmate's blog to the blog area.. make sure u check it out if you have time too ok? =P   R.P.S : I also cleaned my room today, wow ;)    That's a  major  achivement.
