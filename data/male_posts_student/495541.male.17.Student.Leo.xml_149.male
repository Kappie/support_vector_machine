Maria and Hudson went with me.  It sucked because we got there right after she had a game then we didn't get to see her play because Hudson had to be home at 4.  Drrrr.. blah.  Well tonight was fun.  Went to see 'How to lose a guy in 10 days' with Whit.  It was amusing to say the least.  Funny how they set it up and everything.  It was worth maybe $5 of the $7.50... not the whole deal.  Yeah so that was tight, then we went to Wendy's and got some Frosties.  That was tight.  That's about it.  Yeah, right I'm bored right now.  The weekend is almost over, but it's cool that we don't have tomorrow.  Still have practice though.  I can't wait until spring break.  That's about it.  I'm tired now.  Night.
