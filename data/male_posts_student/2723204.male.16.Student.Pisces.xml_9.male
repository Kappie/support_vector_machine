But hmmmm, with so much tests lately i've got no linggan all drained away, that's what the education system does to you, drains your inspiration. I finally got CD-R so can burn things already. Haiz, i think i should find a topic just to rant about, ok.............I want to talk about love.  Love, Love what can I possibly write about love? It is probably the most sticky thing on this whole planet which the human race has possibly invented, so addictive, so hurting, so satifying and yet so complex. I used to express love in poems, but I don't know if I can do it in standard essay form. My thoughts on love now are not emotive, rather, its logical and coherent. Okok, i'll talk about her.......nono dun talk about her, later identity kena kan chuan.  WHAT SHOULD I TALK ABOUT? okok, i'll talk about art. What is art? To me, a measure of an artist is not in the amount of technical skill but rather in the amount of self-expression, that's pretty much understood. But i believe that art has to be personal. Look at say, a piece of sky. Take a picture of it and frame it up. Sure, it looks good, its eye candy, but is it art? in my opinion, NO. Art is essentially the conveyance of emotion, its deep and most of the time it is abstract. That's basically what i feel about all forms about art.  Most forms of "art", certain visual arts pieces, "pop" music, all those various mediums of art really aims to please the senses but they fail to please the heart. To those people who say that they listen to classical music to "relax"........i can tell you that its the most myopic statement in all musical history. Classical music, really is meant to make u concentrate on the piece, listen up, and understand what the composer is trying to tell you despite the piece staying at a sedate 60 BPM and with the rhythym throughout. Classical music is perhaps the most complex, intense genre of music, and I have to admit, I have yet to fully appreciate it yet.  If you really appreciate art, it really bypasses your senses and it goes straight into your heart. The piece can really suck, but you understand what the artist was really feeling at that time. Some songs can sound horrible, off beat and out of tune, but once you get the message, the vibe of it, the emotions within it all, that song is really a very powerful force in your life.  okok enough, i writing cos' i 4 days never update my blog lol
