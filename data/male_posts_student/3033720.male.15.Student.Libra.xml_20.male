Last night i went to a party at garretts. It was oodles of fun. We took a picture of this huge lady in food city with daniels camera phone. Maybe you'll see it on his blog one day. Otherwise, not much goin on. Ill try to start posting more. (So many blogs are popin up now.....its just not the "hip" thing to do anymore.)  Oh, by the way, if you're reading this Ashley, "I love ya back".
