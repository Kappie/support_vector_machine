I spent the evening drinking some sort of fruitopia cocktail from a minipitcher I stole from the Peel Pub (mwaha!) and watching Apollo 13. I almost became teary in a few bits - I guess I'm a sucker for a good space disaster story that just happens to be true. That leaves me vulnerable to precisely one movie. Hey, with Superman it seemed like Kryptonite was everywhere, every greased up jackmonkey that wanted a piece of metropolis had a chunk of snotrock that landed in his backyard. With me I just have to steer clear of blockbuster.  So the war in Iraq is over. Wh00t. I've been fortunate enough to be kinda blaise about the whole thing. Huzzah for the kurds, no more gassing. 20 Billion dollars is a decent price for one deposed dictator.  Work was pretty bad for the last little while. School is almost all said and done for this term, so the real concentration turned to work. It was stagnant, agonizing, boring material.Suddenly, from nowhere I am summoned to the managers office. Suddenly it's all new and iteresting and fun again. I have a killer day and things are right with the world. WH00T!  I'm on a bit of a high right now, so we'll leave it at that. Imagine that - in such a good mood, I'm hardly quotable.
