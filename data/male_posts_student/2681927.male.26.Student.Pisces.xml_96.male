And that'snew records, both when it comes to wins in consecutive years and total number of wins.I know that there'sa stage tomorrow, but it won't change the podium.  This years number two, Andreas Klöden, is6 minutes and 38 seconds behind (last year 1.01 mins.), a gap that is about 2 minutes larger than the average for thelast 30years(4.46 mins., my calculation).But the gap is the third smallest that Lance have had.   Podium and time gaps:   2004:  1. Lance Armstrong  2. Andreas Klöden+6.38 3. Ivan Basso+6.59  2003: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Jan Ullrich+1.01 3. Alexander Vinokourov+4.14  2002: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Joseba Beloki +7.17 3. Raimondas Rumsas +8.17  2001: 1. Lance Armstrong  2. Jan Ullrich +6.44 3. Joseba Beloki +9.05  2000: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Jan Ullrich +6.02 3. Joseba Beloki +10.04  1999: 1. Lance Armstrong 2. Alex Zülle +7.17 3. Fernando Escartin +10.36  The smallest gap ever is 8 seconds whenGreg LeMond won and Laurent Fignon finished second 1989. Fignon had50 secondsdown on LeMondwhen the last stage, an individual time trial from Versailles to Paris, started.  The largest gap is 2 hours 49 minutes and 35 seconds from the very first Tour de France in 1903. Maurice Garin was the winner.  ( urlLink Source )
