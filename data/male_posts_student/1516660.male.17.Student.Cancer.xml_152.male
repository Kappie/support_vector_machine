I chatted with Ben and surfed Neopets.  Mom came back at 9.45. I ate fried carrot cake. Spicy cpicy...but nice! After that, I watched cartoons till 11.30. Then, I came online. I chatted with Wendy and XC. Wendy introed me to the wonderful art of grabbing shcool supplies! You can spend hundred plus buying stuff and selling them for thousands! Woah! Can earn loads man! If not for the inflation. Yeah! Now prices of goods dropped very horredously! So terrible that I only earned 2k of profits! Oh well.   Later in the afternoon, I went to Wendy's house to study SS. We got a bit distracted by her brother playing Chocobo Racing, but we managed to finish revising at 5. At one point in time, I did something rather silly. You see ar. There was this box and bottle labelled "Evening Primrose Oil" on the table. I asked Wendy what it is about. She said it was for skincare. Then I read the box. It said something about helping women with their periods. HAHAHA! And I said "Okay...i go eat it". I treid cutting open the plastic capsule and poruing it into a cup of water. Oil flowed out. Eww! Then, I took another pill and broke it apart. This time I decided to drink it. And so I did. And it was horrible!!! I washed my mouth with water. Wendy kept laughing and laughing away. I actually drank oil meant for women! HaHaHa! Later, XC told me that men can take it too, and I am supposed to take it with the plastic. Oh good. Tomorrow I am taking one with the capsule intact! Muhahahaha!  Hmm...after that leh, something happened. The kids were outside playing and created a whole hell of a noise. Lassie started barking at them. One of them said "Shut up!" and another one said "Bark lor! I am not afraid of dogs!". Those insolent maniacs! How dare they insult Lassie?! Lassie have every right to bark! Wendy screamed at them. Wendy's brother let Lassie out to chase them and Wendy's mom glared at them through the window! Coolies! Everybody's defending Lassie! Good dog!  Upon reaching home, I bathed, ate and watched TV. Then I came online. Here I am, writing blog. I think I better go print out my August entries le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!
