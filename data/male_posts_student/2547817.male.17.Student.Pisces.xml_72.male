The type of forgetting I need to learn is forgetting hurt and disappointment. It kills me slowly from inside, eating at what I am.  Oracion needs to learn how not to be whores for gigs. We can't jump at every gig that comes our way... Otherwise we'd have a song written about us. Humor part 2. Leon, you get that one? Haha. It's a matter of choosing our gigs wisely. To be a rockstar, you damn well behave like one. Not behaving like Arthur adorned with many heavy ornaments around neck, and wrist, decked in leather and chained boots which clink with the individual step. Donned thou shalst be in thy own persona.   And on a slightly more random note, people in general have to wake up, be original, not follow trends BLINDLY and learn tact. The list simply goes on.  I hope it's true what they say, when one door closes, another will open. I'll have to look for my reasons and doors. Mind your P's and Q's.
