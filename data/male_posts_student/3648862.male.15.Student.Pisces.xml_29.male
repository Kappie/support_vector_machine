But his looks are not the thing that attrack me to him. I just love talking with him, and I feel happy when I'm talking to him. There's only one problem, he lives on the other side of the country. And most likely hes not even gay. Oh yeah, he's also 2 years older than me. The wierd thing is I don't like older guys but for some reason I'm attracted to him.   I'm gonna order the Neon Genesis Evangelion platium edition this week. Its gonna be awesome, especiall since I should get one of the first printings whish comes with a special slip cover.  It looks as though I'm gonna be workin at a new site, thanks to Ashton. It's gonna be located at Anime-Eden.com. I dont know exactly when were gonna put it up, but it should be a pretty cool site. I designed all of the banners, and they actually look good.   Now that school has started here there is nothing to do. Benny has stoped comming which is a good thing. I dont have to worry about hitting on him. I think I sorta scared him when I put my hand on his thigh. :D  Well I should probably get some sleep, see as I stayed up until 11am this morning. I hope that everything will work itself out and I'll finaly be happy. TTYL
