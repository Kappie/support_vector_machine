That frozen pizza prior to going and having chili fries with the beer made me nauseous.  The dentist I went to today was nice. I got dental goodies and a prescription for special mouth wash.  I watched some TV when I got home. Lost more brain cells.  I should really finish that paper and mail it tomorrow morning before going to UCI. I mentioned to Crystal that I'll be there at 2.  So it seems that Fallout 3 won't happen anytime soon. I'm going to rant on the software industry right now. Seriously, fantasy and adventure RPGs are a dying genre for computer games. It's really fucking sad. While it is true that console games make more money and it makes business sense to have games that can easily be transferred from PC to console, companies are neglecting a group of loyal consumers that have been around for a long time. As much as I love violence, and detail of new games, the humor, characters, and story in classic Sierra and LucasArts games are better than any that exist on a console.   I can't wait for the remake of QFG2 in VGA to come out.  ***
