Thats right, the glorious day where upon I was brought into this world as the savior of man is coming fast! And it happens to coincide, as it does every year, on the drinkinest day on the calendar - St. Patty's day (Though it may soon be known THE DAY OF RECKONING FOR THE COMING OF  THE TYSON, its current humbler label shall do for now)! Aww yea! Seventeen on the Seventeenth! It's my golden year!   But this spring break is also a bad thing, as it means that the end of spring break closesly approaches. I'm not a pessimist or a fatalist, but at the very end of spring break I am retaking the SAT - oy vey. This means, in order to improve my score in math, I must study with my handy prep book over break. But that's not all! Not only must I keep up my studies in my AP classes (ie; Latin) so I don't become totally inept over break, but I also opted to do someting quite foolish. I am taking the World History AP without taking the class. While I did get an 800 on what is apparently one of the easier SAT IIs, my memory over these events long into the past has somewhat dulled. And the AP focuses keenly on post 1000 CE world, and I have a severe deficit in my knowledge of post 1500 Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Thus I went on a Border's spree, and I have thousands of pages to read before the AP, with hopefully enough time to review and practice a DBQ. BUT I SHALL PREVAIL!  RIDE THE ADRENALIN! I may simply be in a manic phase, but I feel great! Now I leave you, for I much reading to do, and much information  about the past, the present, and people to absorb.   (PS: Hildalgo sucks. Viggo Mortesen is okay, but the rest is kinda slow and boring - which is odd for a horse racing movie. The plot was interesting enough and it was cool to see stuff I've read about like Wild Bill's Western Round UP, but it was so poorly paced. Also, Viggo finds another reason to sing in a esoteric languange, trading Elvish for Sioux. It's not that I don't like foreign songs, but Viggo manages to sound both pretentious and stupid whenever he does it. Especially in such 'unique' languages.)
