I’m hopping that I’ll keep this up dated, and I’m doubtlessly not the first to say that. I’m also that it won’t turn into another bad Bridget Jones’ Diary rip off, or a pit which I pour my bile into every day. That wouldn’t be very nice, there’s far too much of it.    Mostly I’m hoping to put up chronicles of fun things I’ve done. Fun things you should do to. Like see bands live and cook, thought not at the same time. Obviously.    And now Batman?    To bed. I have along day ahead of me, its Bristol’s Ashton court festival, and I want to make it to the end and see Goldie Looking Chain. I think I’ll write a review.    Tim
