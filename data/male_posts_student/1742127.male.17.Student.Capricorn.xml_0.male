I tried my hardest not to cry but found it impossible during some parts. :( LoL  Poor Mikey was unable to attend cuz it takes him 10 minutes just to get up much less get up and around like going into town. I love spending time with him though. Even if we are just sitting around watching T.V. I have this feeling like I am where I am supposed to be. I love him SO much! :) I wouldn't want to be with anyone else for a long long longggggg time. I feel VERY lucky and I think I would DIE without him! LoL  Have you ever seen "You've Got Mail" ?? It's SOOO good. I love how Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks act together. It's so natural!!!  Today I was discussing with Mikey's dad what I was going to do with my future. He said that Mikey had mentioned to him how I was going to go into Nurse School after highschool. Well, that's kinda what my mom wanted me to do. Not really my aspiration, but I guess it would be ok? I dunno. I would much rather major in English and be a journalist or something. I love to give my natural opinion and what could be better than getting paid for it!?!...while using my awesome typing skills! hehe... Well, I'm going to go. I'm staying the night with my Grandma. Sometimes I miss little things like that from when I was young. Hehe, I'm crazy. Adios amigo! ~ChRiStIn
