Anyways, this weekend went by quickly.  School keeps getting closer and I feel the need for a change.  No more drinking every night, no more staying up late, and no more wasting money on stupid shit.  It has got to end.  I figure that I should get a good start on it now before school so that I will already be on the right track when school begins.   Spaten Optimator is my favorite beer right now.  I mean they have been making it since 1397 in Germany.  That's what I call standing the test of time.  It is delicious and strong as hell.  I love it and you should too.
