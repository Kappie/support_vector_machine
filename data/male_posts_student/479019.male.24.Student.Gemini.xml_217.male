Work today went by relatively quick. I was somewhat productive today setting up appointments and doing some work on flags. I know I shouldn't have spent so much money on dinner, but I hadn't been to Casa Garcia in a while. I got myself a Texas burrito, which was damn good. Then again for approximately $7.50... it had to be good. The place unfortunately ripped Samantha off on her combo. They didn't give her a taco, when they should have. That's kind of a bummer.  In other news, I have quite a few money concerns right now. Tuition is due next week, my credit card and phone bills are coming in a few weeks, and when I get to Binghamton, I need to buy a bunch of supplies. That's quite a bit of concern for me. I'm sure things will work out, but still... I have worries.  Tomorrow it's a family portrait at 4 and Ethiopian food at 7. Should be a productive and fun day tomorrow.   Back to reading about World Historical Systems.  ***
