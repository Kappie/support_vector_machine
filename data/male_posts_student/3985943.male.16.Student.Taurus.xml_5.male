It happens...      I really do NOT want to spend the night at home. Someone save me from this Hell. I Just found out that my aunt and uncle are going to be staying through tomorrow (I was pleasently surprised that my uncle's 4 kids didn't end up coming!)and maybe going to Water Country. I just don't know if I want to go.      I'm desperately craving caffeine right now. You know that it's-summer-and-I-just-spent-the-entire-day-swimming-in-the-sun tired?That's what I'm feeling right now. It will wear off in like 30 minutesor so, butI really don't want to wait that long.    Oh! Remember how I asked you all your opinion on the room theme thing? Does anyone have anyinput whatsoever? I'm kinda stuck b/c I like themboth, so I'm looking for what you all have to say.       Another random note: Congratulations to Krystal and Amanda! You guys are so cute! *beams*      I'm off to think of something to do/someplace to go tonight. Give me a call if you already ahve an idea, hahaha. Talk to you later. *hugs*
