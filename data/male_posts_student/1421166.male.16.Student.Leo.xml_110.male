Over what I am not sure. But I do not feel peace. Which is contrary to what the watchnight message was talking about, and what everyone was wishing each other when the clock struck 12.  Didn't sleep last night. It was the YF watchnight programme. Was very tired. After that and slept from 8am to 2pm. Oh well, had to wake up and continue with homework.  I've been feeling stressed today. The thought of going back to school, band and all the busy schedule just freaks me out. I had no peace. And I wasn't ready for school cause my work wasn't done and my mind couldn't run. I wasn't ready for band cause I haven't touched my instrument for weeks and there's a band practice the next day. I wasn't ready for a bisy schedule because I've been just an emotional wreck. I'll probably just be overwhelmed and go crazy. While I was doing my work half way, I just had to stop in the middle of my book review to go thru unresolved matters and my new year resolutions. It's 'O' level year this year, and my year isn't going to be what I pictured. Sigh...  One major consideration is whether to play for the concert in February. Basically, it's my last public performance in Singapore. But I am not ready both physically, technically and emotionally. I've been having headaches, I'm tired, I stressed up and I can't play my pieces for nuts! I haven't even begun practicing them, and there's only a month to it! Argh...  Oh well, I'm really trying to give it all to God now. Guess He's the only one I can depend on now. While in the mean time, I'll see if I can stay out of the performance and give the audition a miss as well.  Oh well, should go. Peace be with me...and all of you out there. Shalom.
