I mean, my life is quite simple: eat, sleep, play ball, some video games, work and go to school once in awhile.  And who cares enough to read MY blogs anyways? (if anyone actually does read this make a comment or something -.-)  Anyways, today was the official last day of my high school career.  It's kinda sad and all, but at least I spent it doing what I love: BASKETBALL.  I got to school at 10:30ish, played for about an hour before getting kicked out for lunch break... went to KFC to clog my arteries, and played ball for the rest of the day.  It's weird tho cuz after school, I was standing in the caf... and not wanting to leave.  I'm don't think im the sentimental type, but I was sad to see it go.  Mowat's been my 2nd home for 4 years, and now its time to move on...  During ball, i was quite surprised when one of my female friends starting lighting it up!!! We have a 2v2 challenge wit me and my friend against her and her friend... i admit i did underestimate her... but shes still not good enough to beat us :P!!! I guess it goes to show that guys should never underestimate girls in sports, even physical ones... well except full contact football... and baseball... girls got their own girly versions (flag football and hardball or something... :S)  I got my yearbook too!! (thx to everyone who signed it)  But I didn't get a SINGLE SHOUTOUT!!  I thought I musta impacted someone's life enough to put my initials... guess I was sadly mistaken... :(  My grad comment didn't get published either... but I wouldn't have shouted out anyone cuz there's too many ppl that mean sooo much to me that I knew that I would offend someone.  Well, even if I haven't changed any lives, I hope that my friends will realize that I will always be here for them when they need a friend...  For those of you who wished I had posted a grad comment, I think it mighta gone something like this: "Hey Mowat, It's been 4 gruesome years but we finally made it! But I never would of made it this far without all my friends and family who supported me the whole way.  Every friendly gesture, down to the most insignificant waves, will be remembered and cherished for the rest of my life.      "I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain.  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday."      -Boyz II Men"  For the 4th nite in a row my parents have left me and my older brother to find our own dinner.  It wouldn't be so bad if we had some mac  cheese here or something... but there is NOTHING in our home. :( Last nite I started playing sc (starcraft) and forgot about dinner... guess im doing the same tonite T.T.....
