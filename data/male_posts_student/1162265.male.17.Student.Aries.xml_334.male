She apparently is 18, but must not have gone to Columbia because I don't remember seeing her around school, and she's pretty too so I find it even stranger I never saw her before.  It was funny explaining to kids what hip hop was.  "Imagine everything wonderful mixed into a dance."  "So we are going to be watching it?"  "No! We get to do it!"  It was hella fun, and since I had to do it (needing to keep my black liscense) anyway, I tried to have a good time until one of my kids needed to go back to Ms. Carmen for a water bottle.
