And just ONCE I would love to see one of the presenters (either faculty or student) get up and say something like, "Hey y'all, it's been great, I love all of you, be careful on the way home."  You know, short and sweet.  But NO, everyone thinks this is their opportunity to share their wisdom and sentiments with all these people; I have to admit, all of the student presentations were pretty good, but I think that all of the graduation speakers must have some secret web site they all download their speeches from (they all say the same thing!).  But it was cool to see Katie graduating.  It was weird when EB graduated (I felt so OLD), but now I think I've come to terms with the whole "getting old thing" and it's not so startling.  Of course, that doesn't mean that I'm accepting EVERY aspect of it, but at the same time I realize it's only natural that friends are going to get married, brothers and sisters are going to graduate, etc. etc. etc.  But it'll probably be something else when one of my brothers or sisters gets married (which will probably be before I do :P).  The rest of my day was ok.  I heard back from one of the temp agencies and a landscaping place that I interviewed with yesterday - the landscaping place said that they reevaluated their demand and decided they didn't need anyone right now, but the temp agency said that they had a job I could work next week, so that's definitely a step in the right direction.  I also finally dragged my butt into the gym today.  Rode five and a half miles on the stationary, then lifted weights, then went and swam some - it was a good start.  Of course, I would have swam more except the suit I bought the other day was too large and I had to be careful not to swim too fast and swim right out of it =D.  And then I went and played our v-ball games tonight (they didn't go so well, but we had two subs tonight), so that was fun :)  Of course, the real test will be how I feel tomorrow morning; after I lifted on Friday I hurt like crazy all weekend, but I think that b-ball in the morning and getting into the gym early (and a lot of Ibuprofen) should be able to forestall most aches and pains.
