We went to a different Ethiopian restaurant than the one Naomi N. and I usually go to because I wanted to try a different one... one where the waitress isn't mean. Ethiopian is always good stuff, and Steff really dug it. Then we drove to the Key Club and pre-partied in the car by talking over shots of tequila. Then went into the show. It was a great show. The review is up on my concerts page. My legs are still kind of scratched up from climbing up onto the stage. Then we went back to Irvine and went to Dennys. Not before having more tequila though.   We made it into a sort of early birthday celebration. It was cool with it being us Gemini hanging out. I guess we learned more about one another in one night than over the 2 years we've known each other, which is pretty cool.   It's 9:15 AM right now... I didn't go to sleep until 5 something in the morning... man 4 hours of sleep. I'm supposed to go to the honors convocation to cheer for Naomi R. later and go to a party. Man... I think I've drank every night this week... heavily at that too!  ****
