Its not like Scotland was like Spain or Italy or Britain with their explorer/imperialism gig.  the amount of people who are fully Scottish are so few!!  Clearly, Scots must have "cross bred" with everyone. They must have had a huge drunken orgy that went on for about 100 years.  Or maybe it was just one Scotsman. One Immortal, Immoral jedi pimp known as SCOTMAN!  "Hello Mr. Scot" *cheesy Porn Music* "I actually needed a handy man, but you'll have to do" *wink* Scotman must have inseminated half of Europe and these half-castes went on to colonize everywhere else, shunned by their community for being bastards.  This explains a lot.  "Scotman is thrusting in the general direction of the new world" This also explains the bastardization of the English Royal Family.  Queen of England: "You said you used protection!" Scotman: "Scotman says a lot of things... Oh Yeah"  When I grow up I want to be just like him. Oh  if you were offended by that, just think of every other ethnic group that's been persecuted. That's right. Shut the hell up.
