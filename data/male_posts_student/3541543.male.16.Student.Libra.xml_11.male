Yeah I'm a bad storyteller and people just laugh when I try and tell something. I can make lots of things sound most uncool, anyways here it goes. A few weeks back I was sitting down looking at my stomach. Not a sight for sore eyes lemme tell ya haha. My stomach, especially down in the belly button region, is really really hairy. And the hairs were getting thick and curly. Not wanting to look like a guido at the beach I decided to do the worst thing imaginable and I shaved my whole front side. Not one cut or nick and all of the hair was gone. And boy was my belly smooth, I'm talking like freshly baby powdered baby butt smooth. And when I put a shirt on it felt really weird because it has been so long since my stomach touched cloth and not my belly hair. Well being proud of my new smooth belly I took a picture of it. And I showed a couple of my lady friends and got a thumbs up for a goodjob. But here is the problem  Not even a freaking day into this new smoothness I got hair coming back, and I rub it the wrong way and it hurts like a mofo. I'm telling myself what a freaking idiot SHAVING my stomach is totally retarded. Well fearing this already stubbly belly I shave again, but this time I draw blood!! and like a dumba** I put aftershave on my stomach. Holy crap it stung sooo bad and I'm still bleeding. After an hour the bleeding stop and now I got little red bumps on my stomach. Totally unattractive......and how am I suppose to go to the beach in NC with this sort of thing!! I feel so stupid, karma bit me well on the A**. I don't even care about my stomach hair, I'd rather have these nasty little bumps go away. My skin gets irritated easily I suppose. I don't know, I just feel gross. Anyways I got of my shaved belly prior to the whole mishap I got myself in.
