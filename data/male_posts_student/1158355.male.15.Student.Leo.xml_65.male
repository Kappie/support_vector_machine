I basically quit the last day to go to band practice. Chad and I played some free style along with James but we never had an official practice because Paul kept running off with Steve into town. Ok, Kevin is this man in his 20's who bikes around everywhere and has mental disabilities. Well, he's not that dum, he only thinks he goes 122 mph on his bike and everything including his daily fee for his cell phone costs $2200. Oh god, we were crackin. Then I came home, played the totally insane Enter The Matrix, then listened to Matt cry. GOoD Night.
