So yeah I got 2 hours of work in because DAN KEESIS HAD TO TAKE HIS CAR IN BUT STILL HAS ANOTHER CAR, THE JACKASS.  And now I'm thinking about resting till 7, then writing a story poem about Miyamoto Musashi (the most badass samurai of all time).  Heres how it breaks down -   Most badass Ving Tsung - General Kwan Most badass samurai - Musashi Most badass templar - Richard the Lionheart (hahah cool name) Most badass pirate - either Maddox or Blackbeard  and the list goes on.......  I have too much....... or too little free time.
