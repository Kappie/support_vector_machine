Really, though, its more likely I am projecting my frustration undeservedly. I don't know what they could do given the impecably passive and incontravertable immunity of the government on the issue. Boy, being screwed politically sure is demoralising. And we were screwed so badly it will probably take some of us a long while to get back up again.  I did feel bad for the members of  Rainbow Labour  though. Labour's treacherous backflip must have been bad enough, but for the Shadow Attorney General Nicola Roxon to have attended and spoken at an anti-gay rally in Canberra, which she later described as ' fantastic ', must have been truly mortifying. I have been eagerly awaiting their response, and was not disappointed. Its currently on the site's  index page . What a kick in the teeth.  I have also experienced some (probably unreasonable and self-indulgent) frustration at the lack of commentary I have heard on the issue from most of my straight friends and family. The government has just outlawed me from ever marrying and no one has anything to say about it? Not even a simple 'shit aye'. My anger is, obviously, bursting and unchecked. Heck, the way it was reported by the media I wouldn't be surprised if not all of them knew.   In an attempt to focus all these feelings more constructively, I have been thinking about my first project.  My partner, Adrian, and I are going to make some t-shirts and possibly bumper stickers. The slogans so far (with the item in [squre brackets], usually some form of rainbow flag, being on the reverse side of the tshirt version) include:  AMOST A CITIZEN [FLAG]  MARRIAGE = WMD             [rainbow ?????s]  INVISIBLE            [FLAG]  EXPENDABLE [FLAG]  ANGRY                             [FLAG]  NO_SILENCE                       [FLAG]  I AM REAL           [FLAG]  NO MORE HOMOPHOBIA IN POLITICS [FLAG]  The idea of creating angry t-shirts isn't exactly original, I know, but I really feel the need to do  something . Plus, I'm sick of the issue's invisibility. Most people I've talked to about this idea have responded very positively and most have even already pledged to buy one, which is very encouraging. At the moment I am thinking of simple black cotton bonds-esque t-shirts with smallish, understated rather than overstated, text. Since Adrian is a graphic designer I'm sure he'll come up with something funky.   The good thing about t-shirts is that they're so public. The people you meet are likely to read them, and they might be people who wouldn't normally think about these things. Its also a way of making more visible the number of people who support gay rights, whether straight or gay. One thing I really want to produce with this project are a bunch of tshirts for straight people to wear (if they're uncomfortable with people being unsure of their sexuality, that is - and who could blame them because being gay can really suck sometimes). I suppose the idea is like a less-confrontational, non-religious version of the  Rainbow Sash Movement , in which  wearing a rainbow sash to church  doesn't signify sexuality, but rather support of accepting sexual diversity. We're having a meeting on Thursday to discuss sponsorship options and look at the costs involved. Will report on the outcomes of that meeting later next week.
