More stickyness and sweatyness :/ thats not good.....I need a air con, but if I got a air con id use it about 1 month and turn it off for the other 11 :p. This heats causing nose bleeds....not the best thing to have in the morning :/ its getting extremly annoying and getting it to stop wastes much time, if this doesnt stop ill most likly bleed to death in my own bathroom, for my sake I hope not. God I hate the heat! I just cant wait for autumn to come again with its cooling winds and its autmn leaves!  I cant sleep. This summer my sleeping times are really bad. Ive turned nocturnal as I sleep around 3am-6am and wake up between 2pm-5pm. Its bad and if I was at school this would be even worse! Still I hope to fix this naturally or if not ill have to resort to using sleeping tablets like Nytol or something. Is this callsed as insomnia perhaps? I think insomnias when you have a disturbed sleep pattern but once im asleep im pretty much out like a log....still insomnia by Feeder is a nice song! :p  In other news I was watching the F1 and J.Button drove a very good race in the Geramn GP last weekend. From 13th on the grid to 2nd was a pretty impressive drive and his battle with F.Alonso was one of the more entertaining moments of the season along with Monaco where he battled it out with J.Trulli. Still the race was dampened by the fact that K.Raikkonen lost his rear wing causing him to slam into the tyre wall and that meant he couldnt challenge M.Shumacher for the win, such a shame. 3 week break from F1 now only 1 week in and I cant wait till the next race at Hungry. Ofcourse you guys maybe dont watch the F1 and you guys havnt got a clue what im talking about. In which case ignore me! :p  So my friend wants me to go see a live band. Ofcourse hes sorta pushing me to go see any band -_- Which I cant be bothered to do. I think Ill go see a band I might be somewaht intrested in :p He asked me to go see Avenged Sevenfold but they are a bit too gothic for my liking and I dont seem to take to the whole idea of mosh pits where people just smack into each other? hmm I should have got a ticket to see Snow Patrol :/ but then again the hardcore music fans would probably call my tatse it musis diabolical. But atleast I aint going around claiming to love boybands which is worse.  My exam results will be out in august and im worried I do believe i messed a few exams up and it cant be helped. Just hope god and maybe lady luck is on my side. I hope they are. But before exam results its my birthday soon. Its actually coming sooner then I thought and ill be another day closer to death. Im so cynical, the glass is half empty the glass is half full whatever psychological babble that is. I need some more friends to celebrate stuff with. Never seem to have a ample supply of friends :/ :(  And this draws to a close this long blog full of doo lally nonsense. If you made it to the end without falling asleep I salute you for you are a true warrior :p Dont have nightmares now.
