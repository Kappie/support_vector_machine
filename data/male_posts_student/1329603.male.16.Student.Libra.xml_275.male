Oddness. Liv wasn't there *annoyed about that*. We watched the recording of the dress rehearsal and looking at the scenes between Marius and Eponine I just looked at the television, heard myself, saw my actions, and stuttered my way through saying "That is NOT me.". Before Les Mis I was very nervous about being huggy with women, but now... definitely a certain amount of Marius has become me. I worry about how much. Which may come across as strange - I worry about how much my personality is changing from... well, me, to someone who pretty much every person who has the slightest romantic interest in men falls in love with. But I do.  The Bill Bailey poster is sitting in pride of place next to my Gr.8 Distinction certificate (I don't care, I can still be smug about it after a long time ^_^). In't he great? Seriously, unforgettable night.  Something for Laura to be perhaps a bit jolly about - this morning at Andrea's we were watching MTV and such (they wouldn't let me watch Kerrang (thanks be to ZoÃ« for introducing me to the station in the first place, love you)) and This Love came on and the group of 6/7 of us all sang along to the chorus when it came around... we didn't know anything else but the chorus was fun. When it came arou, hownd.  Back to exams tomorrow, with Biology. Aaaaaah.  Quote of the day: "The bombs go off, don't make a sound. How many people were around? The cry of children in the night, No guns, no knives, no will to fight."  From NJaN's   Peace   Love, Jon Roskilly
