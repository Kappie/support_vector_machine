So the time we have now, we went to play pool and lan gaming than went to cineleisure to Bowl at the 9th floor, went to eat dinner at Mos Burger and went to HMV...saw alot of chio gals haha really is alot loh...it was 8.50pm already so we went for the show and was so excited and can't wait for the show to start. Dam...the show was great man , dam nice and its funny, exciting, spooky and better than the previous Harry Potter movies, dam i giv it 5 stars for this movie. i denfinetly will watch it again haha. The show end at 11pm and we went for a bite, took a cab back after that. Yawn*.....(sleeping).
