I never cry! well.... Thats a lie. I only cry when something that beautiful and breath-taking happens.   I cried during the part of the movie where all the torches light ablaze on the mountains and hilltops. That was beautiful.  I give the trilogy seven gold coins out of seven gold coins. Again... The highest rating. __________________________________________________________________  0000000 out of 0000000
