Man stupid ass finals. I made hella stupid mistakes in physics, which is gay, and finally , I did ok in math. Stupid parabola's and shitz.  Seems Amanda's mom gave her a scare last night, just as my dad gave me a scare, opened the door real fast to my room and made me have an adreniline rush, I was more awake then shit. Damn parents, don't understand, we kids don't do stuff in advance. :p She also stayed awake the entire night, but for work purposes. I on the otherhand being a freak of nature stayed up, doing nothing, not even really studying. But got some good pics though, guess the night was good for something.  Well times a ticking, running out, just a few more days and I'm out of here. God save me, I don't want to go. :( Want to have a free summer, ah well, I guess I'll take a lot of pictures and meditate a lot.  Well I gotta take a dump :p well not really, just wanted to end this post funny. LOL! I'm a freak!
