I'm talking theology here, so if you're non-christian you won't probably be interested. But its about homosexuality and the church, so if you are interested, feel free to post your comments.  While I think homosexuality is wrong, well, it presents some problems to God when he wanna do some population control, just like the Singapore government  . But I have to state something. If you had to choose, and you have to choose, a habitual liar or a homosexual as a pastor, who would more likely get the job? Probably the liar. It is really what I deem as the prioritization of sins.   God killed Ananias and Sapphira for lying, as well as Sodom and Gomorrah. The bible do not prioritize sins over one another, saying one is more serious, and another as less serious. It does say homosexuality is an abomination, but it promises the "digging out of the eyes by vultures" to those who do not honour their father and mother. The church as a whole do have a greater tolerance for other forms of sins, but not homosexuality.   As for the whole Sodom and Gomorrah issue. I think its not homosexuality but rather sexual immorality. Judging from the way their sexual lifestyles went, I believe that God will still judge them even if it was heterosexual. Many homosexuals today, especially those involved in relationships. They tend to be under much social, cultural and religious scrutiny, so their relationships tend to be very much wholesome and well-taken care of.   In fact, many homosexual couples out there do serve as examples of healthy romantic relationships. Not saying that heterosexual ones aren't exemplary but gay ones have the trust, communication etc. essential to any romantic relationship, and it is healthy, if this relationship is replicated into a heterosexual one. Homosexual couples in modern societies differ greatly from those in Sodom and Gommorah.   No doubt, homosexuality is a sin, but I believe a heterosexual relationship plagued by lying isn't any better than a homosexual relationship with truthfulness. Like I said, homosexuality is just like any other sin, like lying. God does not play favourites, sin is sin. No big no small sins. I do not like the way how homosexuality is elevated as a big sin, while lying and other "small" ones go unnoticed.
