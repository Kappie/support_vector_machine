It was quite fun really apart from the dickheads who sit there holding up the whole group and show us all up.  After school we had a cool barbeque party and loads of relatives and people came.  After a stupid day at school I wasn't feeling verye xcited so I just sat about eating stuff and drinking beer heh.  The champagne was so nice.  I was fine with the alcohol, but as soon as I ate a cake and sugar was rushing through my body I felt really weird as I always do after a sugary snack.  I hope tomorrow will be a better day at school...
