Walked to the URA building and waited for everyone to reach. In the end when the whole class has reached, Mr Chandra still haven't appear. Then at 9am sharp, Mr Chandra appear... Ta da!      Today we have to split into groups of 5 or 6 to complete some tasks. Me, Xin Hao, Meme, Raymond, Victor and Jun Qing formed one group. Then we went off to complete the tasks. Our group split into two groups - Me, Xin Hao and Victor went to take photos of the URA building while Meme, Jun Qing and Raymond stayed at the URA building to sketch and take photos of the "Coin" - A huge twisted coin which is displayed outside the URA front door.         After me, Xin Hao and Victor finish taking photos of the URA building, we went on to take photos of some shophouses. After that we went back to the URA building and only saw Jun Qing and Raymond sketching, don't know where Meme went. So the 3 of us also started to sketch the twisted "Coin". Then Meme came out from the URA building, it seems that she has gone in to find some information about the tasks we were supposed to do. After that we went to the location of the last task. Then we went searching for some shophouses which looks similar to the picture which has been given to us.                 We search and search and search and search and after about 1-2 hours of searching, we still couldn't find it. We saw a man selling ice-cream so we went to buy from him. Mmmm... it was so delicious. After eating the ice-cream, we continue searching. After about one hour of searching, we came across a Indian shop and Meme went in to ask about the address - Stanley Street No. 10, which she had writen down when she was searching for information in the URA building. The Indian man drew out the way for us so we went on searching for that street. Finally, after turning around corners and walking a very long way we found the shophouses which are exactly the ones in the picture. Haha ^_^ so happy we finally found it.      We took photos of the shophouses and then Meme, Xin Hao and Victor went to ask about some questions while the rest of us waited outside. They came out from the shophouses and it appears that they didn't get the answers to the questions. Then we realised the answers we need were already all copied down by Meme while she was searching for information in the URA building. All we had to do now is to sketch the shophouses and we finish all our tasks. Halfway sketching, it started to drizzle, luckily there was shelter above us so we could continue sketching. It seems that we were the only group managed to find the exact shophouses as the picture. The other groups just find some other shophouses which looks like those in the picture.           After sketching, the drizzle also stopped, so we went for lunch. I ate a plate of chicken drumstick noodle - $4 and a can of sarsi - $1. After eating, we went to find the Indian man and took a photo with him (well he helped to finish our task). Then we went to the place where we were supposed to meet Mr Chandra but didn't saw him so we went back to the URA building. Back at the URA building, we didn't see anyone else so Xin Hao called Mr Chandra and he said that we could go back home already... ap. It began to drizzle as we were walking towards the mrt station...      Went with my mum and sis to hougang mall at night to buy new jeans and shoes. Then went home to watch Guess Guess Guess ?_?         Transport taken today: Mrt, Bus 74, Bus 147     Feeling: Tired
