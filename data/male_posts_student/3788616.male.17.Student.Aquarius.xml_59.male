Having to concentrate more, work harder and study harder, do you think i can be myself?! so yeah, just focusing more on my work, simply ignoring quite a lot that's been happening around me, but i tell you, i can't keep this up... Already 1 day, i cannot  tahan  liao... som i guess, i won't be like so crazy, going to keep my focus, but can't be that anti-social right?!  Oh well.... anyway, it's Xiang Hong's birthday tomorrow... so just want to say... HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRL! May all your wishes come true yeah! Keep smiling! :p haha... anyway, am now working on something that i am doing for Kelly... so, won't make this entry long...
