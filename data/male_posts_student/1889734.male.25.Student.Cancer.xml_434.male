Only one or two people seemed to care at all about the concept itself. The expected cry of "feed the chilrun" was heard. I did my best to point out that no money would be diverted from their needy, greedy little mouths, but that some tiny fraction of the Federal pie would be put to noble use. That was the last talk of money concerns.  One of the two professors questioned my emphasis on Federal control over space exploration, pointing out that for a long time now private companies have been putting things into space. I countered that I wasn't talking about satellites, but in putting men on Mars; on grand prokects that honestly offer little financial incentive for thier undertaking. I advanced the idea of a NASA-pioneered endeavor to be followed by private exploitation of the newly viable tech. But that was too complex apparently because those who responded acted like I said nothing.  One professor seems preoccupied with religion, so his contribution was to ask how I thought discovery would impact religions. I said they would all adapt. People would persist in their illusions. There was some more discussion on this, but I didn't really care much so I forgot it.  Really, we missed the idea that space MUST be explored. we seemed to get sidetracked to areas I didn't care about. I wish I could have had total control over the class. Even more, I wish those mutes would care about it and speak up.
