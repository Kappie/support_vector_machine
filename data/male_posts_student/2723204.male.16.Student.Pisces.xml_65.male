Garlands hanging around my neck, What the fuck, how did it all came to be? As the shame of my life turns to night. Forgotten kisses which passed the shoulder. Dying without regret, as what eternity is death? Thought I could never put my life past me. But here I am in this nailed coffin, smirking while all else mourn my passing.  Killed in an iron maiden. Humiliated on the gullontine. Shame which filled my life are now past, Gone with my head as it rolled on the stone cold floor. Seeking valhalla, seeking heaven. And they told me beware of the pharisees which have the leaven. "Hypocrites", "Hypocrites" as Jesus said. Please Dear God, I don't want to end up like them.  Up amongst the throne of judgement, my dear hevenly father sat. My child, you have suffered, but your work ain't done. Go back to Earth, you have not yet had your fun. And back to the world I went, just as God has sent. Seeing the furnace burn, charring the lips which I once kissed. Just as they thought I would mourn with them, How wrong they were, for I would never shed any tears for this sham.
