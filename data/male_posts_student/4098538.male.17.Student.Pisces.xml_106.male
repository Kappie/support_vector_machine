I really do love it there. I went off exploring in a load of 6 foot weeds and took lots of pictures of various things, like flowers, bees, insects, trees, etc, while Mandy did some sketching. Then I did a little sketch of a really cool tree. I got home and took some more pictures in my back garden. All photos have been uploaded onto  urlLink www.flickr.com/photos/slow_chemical . Check them out please, and post comments! I'm going round to Mandy's in ther morning, EARLY. I plan on getting a bus at about 7am, if I can even get up that early!
