Had a few shots on an empty stomach... got pretty buzzed.. gave kevin a call he said..   "I'm at club 21.. we're just going to order pizza!"  :/   but i wanted pizza smut. me and kate took the tunnels to burger king.. somehow we got lost in the tunnels.. i swear to god we're  dumb and dumber .. ate bk and got lost on the way back too! went back to the 9th floor and drunk some more rum while watching big fat abnoxious fiance.. then headed up to club 21! Drunk some more rum mixed with orange soda.. and most of the guys came back from a beer run. Went back to my room to get cups and ping pong balls for beer pong. In my room i fucking had my open bookbag sitting on my chair and the  bottle of rum falls and shatters on the floor ! i was so upset. cleaned it up and brought up a 22 of high grav. went back up to club 21 and me and kate were a team against eric and josh in beer pong.. we lost the game.. but i drunk a lot of beer so  i really didn't lose .. the 22 of high grav went fast so i ran back down to my room to get my last 22 and then ran back up.  Played another game of beer pong with Angelo being my partner against two other guys whos name i don't know.. we win... i drink more.. i try to do magic tricks with a deck of cards but it didn't work out..  where's chris when you need a magician ?! bring the 22 to derek's room.. where we are all doing karaoke.. so much fun.. i love singing..!   Ok.. now people who know me know that i NEVER get piss drunk to the point where i can't walk.. mostly because i throw parties and i have to keep the party and myself under control.. but since i'm the guest of the party.. i drink like a monster.. i haven't been that drunk in months   2am.. eric wants to sleep so he kicks everyone out of his room.. me and kate go back to her room.. we layed down and i just kept drunken rambling blah blah blah.. i'm sorry you had to put up with it! i passed out cold at like 230am.. woke up at 530am still drunk and dizzy as hell..  run to the bathroom and puke .. lay next to kate and pass out again.. wake up at about 1 pm and feel like shit.. kate's suitemate's parents are in the suite area.. i wanted to go out there in my boxers and be like ughhh i'm so hungover..   130pm kate walked me out  (walk of shame)  and i went back to my room.. kev was sleeping as usual and zach was listening to skinhead music. zach blew a horn which woke up kevin and most of UAlbany.. and now here i am.. i need to shit shower and shave my balls.. keep you guys posted.. peace!!!  - R w L super SMUT
