I don't think Nomar's ever seemed so hostile to playing in Boston -- I'm mostly thinking of the way he repeatedly references his wanting to stay and what people say.   Update : No sooner do I start running my mouth off than Nomar starts going on a tear.  I'm not saying that Nomar's grievances aren't legitimate, only that we should get something for him if he's going to walk at the end of the year.  I'd hate to see him in a different uniform next year, but I'd hate for him to walk without us getting any compensation.
