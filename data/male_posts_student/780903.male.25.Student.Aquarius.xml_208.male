Anerican Medical Systems, Inc. sought class certification of a nationwide class of people  who suffered damages from implants of allegedly defective penile prostheses  manufactured by defendant. *** It noted that class members had used  at least ten different models  of the prosthesis and that legal claims would 'differ depending upon the model and the year it was issued.'  It also found that there would be individualized evidence as to such issues as 'surgical error, improper use of the device,  anatomical incompatibility , infection, device malfunction, or  psychological problems .'"  And you thought law school reading was dry and boring!
