We talked and sold and ate and played silly mind games.   I fear I may be getting prideful over The Brothers. I take it many places to read, but do I only bring it there to receive the praise of men? Do I only do it to make people think I am intelligent or wise or somesuch? Upon self-searching, I find this false. I am still too great a loner and a fool to do such a stunt for popular gain.  Have you ever read the Book of Jeremiah in the Old Testament? If any of you believe God has your best material interests in mind, read this book. In it, God sends plague, famine, Babylonians, and other great deathmakers of the ancient world on to his chosen people. God is not opposed to corpereal punishment. His actions were to set his people back on the right track. Or were they? Perhaps also, they were punishment, brought down to humble and repay the Israelites for their wandering ways. Either way, I find in this book proof that you cannot be a hedonist and a Christian. Pleasure is unquestionably not the final goal of God. Truth? Salvation? Self-surrenderence, perchance? Whatever is the finish line to cross, it is not material pleasure.
