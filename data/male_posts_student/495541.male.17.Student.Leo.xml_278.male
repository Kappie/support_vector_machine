I really like it. :)  Blogger now has comments supported too.  I love it.  Just illegally downloaded music.  I plan to buy the CDs now that I like the songs.  Is there something wrong with that?  I downloaded other songs, I don't like them... I deleted them.  This is how the record industry should work.  You can listen to the song for 15 minutes before you buy, or something.  Or be able to listen to it twice or something... before you buy.  What else is new?  I don't know.
