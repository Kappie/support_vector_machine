Well, on monday, I received this email from Gervais after he read my blog. Well, I'm not gonna say wad he wrote in there cuz it's like more than 1pg long. I was kindda pissed after readin tt as I felt tt some stuff he wrote bout' me in there wasn't true. I didnt reply him instantly as I had a pretty hard time controlling my emotions, so I decided not to reply. When I managed to relax a lil' bit, I realised something tt I didn't think bout' earlier. By takin time juz to write an email and expressin how he feels to me, I feel tt he's being sincere. I dunnoe wad others think and I dun realli care, but tt juz proves tt he's sincere bout' our frenship and tt he will like to maintain it. Well, I was glad he did write tt to me in the end.            On tuesday, life was normal and I decided tt I shld gifGervais a reply and not hold anything back. So, I wrote back a reply and expressed allmy feelings. I was glad I did tt. At nite, I told him to check his inbox, he told me tt he read it already and continued talkin bout our misunderstanding and stuff. Seriously, I'm realli grateful tt he chat wif me on msn and told me more stuff tt will make us haf a stronger frenship. I always believe tt to haf a strong frenship, there needs to be an arguement. Well, tt's cause it makes us understand each other betta. So far, all of my strong frens I hafhad an arguement wif me b4. I realised tt an arguement onli brings us closer if u do patch up. Well, but he said this to me " I dun wanna force u to come talk to me. neither do i wanna force myself too.so i'll juz let it be natural n mutual." So my guess was tt he wasn't interested to come talk to me anymore and I think I was rite bout' tt. Den it leads me to think whether I would wanna talk to him again, well I do, but I dun think I'll be able to if it goes on like this, so I'll juz hafta wait for the ritetime.             On wednesday, he didnt talk to me and I didnt talk to him either. L0L! sounds kindda lame rite? I rushed home to rest and watched The Amazing Race at     8pm    on AXN. After tt I juz slacked and didnt do much as I was tired and neededa rest. I slept early tt nite.            On thursday, there was still no conversation started by either one of us. I finally start to realise wad he means by natural n mutual. But well, I'll juz hafta live wif tt. After sch I went wif Sian Yang to catch a movie at west mall. I realised smt wasn't quite rite when he told his B.B pals tt he wouldn't going wif them. I asked him on the way when we were walkin to the bus stop if he had anything. I said if he did he can always go back. He said it didnt hafta do wif any B.B stuff and told me the real reason why he didnt wanna be wif them. On the 176 bus to West Mall, well it was a totally different side of Sian Yang tt I nvr seen b4. I realised how this guy realli is and tt he's a realli nice, sweet and sensitive guy. The onli problem was tt ppl took advantage of his kindness. He told me some stuff bout' certain ppl tt I nvr knew. Well, I was realli shocked tt those ppl were actually like tt, I didnt noe wad to say. Anyway, we had lunch and watched King Arthur at    4pm   . The movie wasn't tt bad like most ppl said it was, actually I enjoyed it too. And watching a movie wif Sian Yang is definitely fun too. L0L!            Today is Friday and dun be surprised when I say we're still not talkin. L0L!I dun think the time is rite yet, but I do hope when we start talkin again, I'll be able to open up to him more and enjoy being around wif him more. Well, I'm not sayin tt I didn't enjoy being wif him last time, I actually did haf a hell lot of fun wif him. But I'm juz hoping tt there will bemore fun and enjoyment in the future.L0L!Man, some ppl juz ought to be thought to respect others and not gif tt stupid fucked up face. Well, how I wish tt bastard get to be thought a lesson. He's so damn lucky ttit wasn't in the public, cuz if it was, he'll probably get whacked byotherstill he startsbleeding. And guess wad, if I was wif him in public, I wont even help him as tt was some bitchass son of a bitch face shown by a disrespectful piece of crap! Yes, and I was totally Disgusted by his behaviour and some others who laughed at someone who they actually think is harmless. Egoistical Bastards who think tt they're the best fighters in the world. I won't be surprised to see them on their knees prayin for mercy in the near future.            Well,tt's basically sums up the wk in juz 1 LONG entry. L0L! Alrite den, I'll update u some other time, maybe not daily anymore, but once in 2-3 days when there's some happenings. Well the #1 thing on the list of wad I shld do nxt wk is to talk to Gervais and start openin up more to him. Yup! Tt's bout' it for today. Cya soon~! =]
