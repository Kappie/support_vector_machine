I may be borderline psychotic sometimes, but that's perfectly normal... isn't it?   Elaborate. Posthaste.  Fine. My name is Dylan Williams. I am 13 years old. I live in upstate New York, which is full of rednecks. You do know what a profile is for, don't you?   Hey, I know you! I'm going to tell (Name) what you said about them!  Bite me. And while you're at it, perform some sort of self-mutilation. It entertains me. (In the rare case that I use actual names, go right ahead and tell them what I said. I don't care.)   How should/can I contact you?  Again, this is what a profile is for. Read it for more details.   Ha ha. Homestar Runner sucks.  DIENOWPLEASE.
