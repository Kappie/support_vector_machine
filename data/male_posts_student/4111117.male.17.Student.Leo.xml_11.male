My Favorite Scene from you got served again, the sequel to You Got Served   David:  I think we got served!  Elgin:  No way, dawg, no way did we get served!  David:  Can someone please check if we got served or not, come on!  Elgin:  Yo, i don't think you understand. this thing we're in is bigger than us, bigger than any serving their crew can dish out. They are the new crew, and if we get served by them, god-damn it, we'll never show our face around here anymore!  David:  El, it's not always about who got served and who didn't get served. i mean, there's a war going on for pete's sake, and what are we doing? just dancing? how's dancing going to bring the deficit down? how's dancing going to make the economy stronger? how's serving wade's crew going to affect global warming? how are we going to get out of iraq? can john kerry establish an international coalition? how do we deal with the situation in iran? by dancing, and serving people? no, i think not, my brother. we get wise, we read the newspaper and watch cnn, nigga, we are going to stand up and say, hey man, this world has had enough of it! i'm sick of serving people, i'm sick of it all! i want an end to this. and then, my brother, the world can be a much safer place and you won't have to serve people. you can serve them with love, serve them with kindness, and brotherhood. Go out, El, and serve the world!  Elgin:  Aight   end scene
