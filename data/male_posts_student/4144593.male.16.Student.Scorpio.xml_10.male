Woke up surprisingly early in the morning, guess i cannot sleep cuz my mind was preoccupied with somethings. Cried over some things in the nite but dun worry guyz it's all over now. Sry if i am emotional or blank out this past week. Anyway i wanted to use the afternoon to do my labreport but some things cropped up and i ended up helping some1 else do their labreport. I'm not really blaming tt person or wat, in fact i wanted to thx the person for just tokin to mi .... I wasn;t really in the mood to do any work anyway considering the things i had to do later in the afternoon.  Went out at bout 3.45 to meet some1. Had to do something horrible to some1. Did not intended to hurt any1 but i guess i had no choice wat so ever. To the person involved if ur reading this , i'm sry i had to do tt to u. It's just tt our hearts are just now beating in the same rythem. I sincerly hope tt u will find a heart tt move in time with u and mend tt abyss trail of destruction tt i have cuz.   Went to meet edmund, doreamon and kel later.I was 15 mins late. Then as if heaven was playin a bad joke on us, we had to wait for 35mins for the stupid bus. The bus reached the area around the concorde hotel and then there was a severe traffic jam arounf the area. We waited for 15mins and the bus mearly moved a few inch. I got fed-up waiting and i went downstair with my frens. I guess Mr paul tan my former com skills leturer was rite singaporeans are idiots. The blind follow the blind and before long all the ppl seated at the top deck came down to complain to the bus driver. Aparrently most of the ppl in the bus were like us, chasing against time to get to watch the fireworks. The bus driver gave in and then he opended the door to let us out. There were like 10 buses behind us and then every1 started alighting.... I guess singaporeans are idiots. Recieved a call from my fren already there sayin the fireworks gonna start in 5 mins time. We ran and ran desperatly trying to get there in time. Every1 around us were oso running. We reached the overhead-bridge near suntec when we heard the first rounds of the fireworks going off. It was kinda of nice sight watchin fireworks from a overhead bridge. After the first rounds went off, we ran again like madmen. A few other rounds of fireworks went off, WE paused to look at the fireworks everytime we heard the sound. Lucky we reached there in time for the last round of fireworks. Captured a image of the last round with the esplande in the foreground and the fireworks in the background on kel's digi cam. The pic was really nice. I gonna upload it into my blog one of these dayz when i'm more free. Then we just stood in front of the esplande while the whole crowd started to disperse. We went to marina square intending to grap a meal but it seems a lot of ppl had the same intentions. So we left marina for raffles link, again it was so crownded tt we could hadly manuvear in the crowd. Decided to walk to bugis then. We walked as we tok bout life generally. Then lulu recieve a call from jian hui's gf telling us tt jian hui who was oso watching the fireworks had fainted. All of us were laughing like hell since jian hui was well known for being physically fit. Then lulu start acting how jian hui would look like if he fainted. Our dinner at Mc was constantly interrupted with calls from jian hui's gf updating us info bout Jian hui. went shopping at parco after tt. Left parco for home at bout 12.
