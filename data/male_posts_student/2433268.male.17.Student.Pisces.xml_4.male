They're just too miserable to care or seek it out.  You just go day in and day out doing absolutely nothing with your life except for that random odd moment that makes you feel it's all worth it. And then that moment is gone...love, happiness, desire, passion, bravery, they're all just flashes in the dark, too brief glimpses into the meaning of life.
