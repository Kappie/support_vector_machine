Slowly but surely I'm finishing off the e-learning projects at work. My goal is to get them done before I retire next year. Getting them done entails more than just getting them working. I also means getting our IT on side with the global project concept and developing a process and key contact people who will make things happen without red tape and barriers. I'm hopeful it can be done. As long as we do it in an intelligent and meaningful manner, involving all of our stakeholders along the way. We'll see.  I signed up for the online version of the book of the month club at  urlLink Audible.com . So far it has proven to be really good. Thoug a little on the expensive side at $20 U.S. per month (30 Cdn) for two books. So a year is $360 Cdn. Yikes..now that I see it in print it's a lot!!! Ah well maybe I can learn something along the way in their  urlLink self help  sections. And be entertained in their  urlLink Fiction  section. For sepnding all that cash I even got a nifty little  urlLink book/MP3  player from them. Their format is propriety though and to load to any device, you have to have it enabled to prevent multiple copying of files to non-paying napster types.
