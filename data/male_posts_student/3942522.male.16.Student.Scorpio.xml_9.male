Red bull and chicken essence ain't useful anymore. I'm numb of it and it doesn't seems to work now. I'm busy nowadays and that's why you can see why its been a long since i blogged. Just had my lunch and i feel so sleepy now and don't know why it always happen. Anyway, I'm going to lie down on my bed and digest all my chicken rice. Bye Bye !
