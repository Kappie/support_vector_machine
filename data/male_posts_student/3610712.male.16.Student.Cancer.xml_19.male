Then today we went to Solvang. We walked around for like five hours. We had chips and salsa and Cream Soda at the Viking Garden, ate pizza while watching Bill O'Reilly at Tower Pizza, and then ate Ã†belskiver. After that we drove to Lake Cachuma and stared blankly at the Bradbury Dam for awhile. Then we decided to drive through Los Olivos and Los Alamos, after which we decided to drive through Guadalupe. Since we were close enough, we went to Santa Maria. Sarah had a gift card for Best Buy, so we went there and she got Massive Attack's "100th Window." Good choice, according to my not-so-humble opinion. Then we drove back to Lompoc, and I went home. Excellent. Flabtabulastic. Cool. Okay. That is all. Thank you, goodbye.
