I've told 'em that I'll come back every now and then to see how things are. They agreed softly.  I've been through this many times before. Creative Arts Program '02, Choral Festival "02, Fairfield, Etphore, 2C, U.W.C.... the list goes on. This is similar, yet different due to the simple fact that either the other instances were friendships forged over a week at most, or friends I still keep in touch with. With Pioneer, it'll be different coz I spent 3 months with these people and now I have to start again.  Damn, another hurdle.
