I have really bad carpal tunnel, for fricks sake.)    ONCE AGAIN , it's Thanksgiving time, and Mr. Turkey said, how very careful I must be or HHH will make me lose my match...or something like that... Anyway, since I have to work late this Sunday, I'll be missing our beloved annual November event.  Therefore, I'll just book the thing myself.  Why not, right?  We WWE viewers are a lot smarter than the writers, or so we'd like to believe.  Whatever the case may be, I'm going to play Drew McMahon (or Vince McDrewcifer, take your pick...)  On with the show:   Jamie Noble vs Tajiri (Cruiserweight Championship)  -- I hear that Jamie Noble is an above average wrestler.  You'd never know it though.  Since he first came in along with his "longtime girlfriend" Nidia (boy, they never mentioned that on Tough Enough), he started out feuding with The Hurricane, then before that angle ever achieved fruition, Hurricane jumped to RAW.  Noble got to run with the Cruiserweight title for a bit, then he went on a long losing streak.  He then swore he was going to bring in "Cousin" Nunzio to help him out.  The Nunzio/Noble angle went...well, nowhere.  (How in the  BLUE HELL were we supposed to buy the whole cousin angle with the Italian New Yorker and the West Virginia redneck anyway?)  Noble floundered around on Velocity for a bit until he discovered that he inherited 64,000 bucks from his dead aunt.  He bought Nidia a fur coat, then we heard what from that angle?  Then he got into this whole group sex thing with Nidia, Torrie, and Chuck Palumbo's former boy-toy, Billy Gunn.  That storyline had a great potential until Mr. Ass did what he does best, and that being laid out with an injury.  (Why the WWE doesn't release their second most oft-injured wrestler is beyond me...and yes, I did say "second most"...more on that later.)   So now Jamie Noble is getting another push, this time in a Championship match on one of the most prestigious PPV's.  So the outcome?  You guessed it:   Tajiri wins via pinfall.    Lita vs. Molly Holly (Women's Title)  -- FINALLLY...LITA HAS COME BACK...with a bit of ring rust.  Trust me, I'm a total mark for Lita and no chance in hell I would kick her out of my bed for eating crackers (let alone  this  cracker).  Lita had been on the shelf for well over a year with an injury she sustained while filming an episode of Dark Angel.  Anyone ever notice that the episode she appeared in was the final episode aired before the show got cancelled?  What?  You never watched the show?  That's right...neither did most of America.  The good news is Lita's back and RAW is a happier place with her.  Let's not discount the fact that Molly Holly has quietly been doing a great job as the Women's Champ.  She went from being a down home southern gal to Hurricane's sidekick (smells like S.H.I.T. to me) to the gal she is today.  Last time I fantasy booked a PPV, I mentioned how the Women's Title gets passed around like a $2 whore...since I'm fantasy booking here, I say Lita gets screwed out of a sure victory, and somehow ends up in a feud with Trish Stratus come WrestleMania time.   Molly wins with the help of Gail Kim.     Kane vs Shane McMahon in an Ambulance Match  -- What is up with the McMahon family anyway?  Last month, we had a PPV match with Vince vs. Stephanie, now we get to see a PPV with not only Shane wrestling Kane in an "Ambulance Match", but Big Poppa Mac  in a "Buried Alive" match with the other Bother of Destruction.  In any case, let's hope the Shane-O-Kane feud ends here.  In my fantasy wrestling FEDERATION, Kane would be the monster heel going for the title against Goldust--I mean Goldberg.  Look for a lot of no-selling by Kane, followed by a huge bump-gone-wrong by Shane, and a  Kane victory.    Undertaker vs. Vince McMahon (Buried Alive Match)  -- I've already ranted enough on the McMahon Family hogging the spotlight, but I will say this:  Ever since the Austin-Vince feud, it seems that any wrestler who has been around for the long haul has to at some point have a big money match with Vince.   Wassupwitdat?  Think about it.  Ric Flair, Hogan, and now Undertaker.  This match is so easy to book, I'm going to bet a month's salary with Pedro on it.  For the last 3 years, Undertaker has dropped his Deadman gimmick in exchange for the biker/husband/American Badass/big-dog-in-the-yard persona.  Taker is also  reaching the twilight of his full-time career.  No question what happens here.  I may be wrong about everything else I'm writing here, but  Vince buries Undertaker alive .  You don't see or hear from the Undertaker for months until possibly No Way Out, or around then, when The DeadMan retuns.   Team Lesnar vs. Team Angle (5-on-5 Elimination Match)  --  I love the idea that WWE is bringing back the old school Survivor Series match.  for you young folks, it works like this: Everytime a person gets pinned, they're elininated from the match.  The battle goes on and on until one team gets totally eliminated.  Lucky for us, there's going to be another Survivor match, 'cuz this one is going to be a stinker!  On one sidewe have the Champ, Brock Lesnar, The Big Slow, a mystery partner,  Matt Morgan (?), and Nathan Jones(?).  The other team consists of Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, Farooq, Bradshaw, and Hrdcore Holly.  Before I make my prediction, I have to ask this:  Why are Holly, Nathan Jones,and Matt Morgan (whom I've never even heard of until a week ago) in a big time PPV event, yet there's no Rey Mysterio, Benjamin Haas, Eddie Guerero..etc.  Somthing is stinkin' in the state of Connecticut.  I don't even have a prediction for this match...lets just say for fun that  Team Lesnar wins when Brock is the sole survivor after a tainted victory over Angle.    Team Austin vs. Team Bischoff (5-on-5 Elimination Match)  -- Now this is a match!  This has been built up well over the last month.  If Austin's team loses, then Stone Cold has to quit as Co-General manager.  If his team wins, then his "No physicality unless otherwise provoked" clause is out the door.  Tell me again what Bischoff has to lose here?  Oh, that's right.  The writers didn't bother coming up with anything more intrigueing than that.  Not to worry though...this is going to be the showstoppa match of the night.Team Bishoff boasts Y2J, Christian, Big Poppa Pump (your hookup), Sexual Chocolate Mark Henry, and Rndy "Legend Killer" Orton.   I need a nickname like that, but I don't think the ladies would swoon over "Sexual Vanilla".  Team Austin has my main man, if you can dig it, Booker T, RVD, The Dudleys, and HBK (you screwed Bret) Shawn Micheals.  Aside from Mark henry, all of the participants involved are true main event caliber wrestlers.  I would actually pay for an entire PPV just for this match and watch it go on for two and a half hours.  The cream of the crop is in this match.  And since Bischoff has nothing to lose, watch his team lose.  My guess sorta goes like this:  HBK pins Mark Henry with the sweet chin music, Steiner beats Devon, then beats Bubba, Booker T pins Steiner after the Dudleys send him through a table, Orton beats Booker T, RVD puts Christian away, Jericho beats Micheals, and  RVD is the sole Survivor after beating Jericho .  That, by the way, is pure fantasy booking...no way it's going to finish like that...   I'm done right?   There's one more match, Drew.   WHAT?   Oh yeah...that thing...I did say somthing about the most oft injured wrestler in the WWE, didn't I?     Before I jump into the next, and hopefully final paragraph, allow me to wish Paul Levesque and Stephanie Levesque, nee McMahon on their nuptiuals last week.  And to celebrate his newfound life as an official McMahon, what do you think Paul Levesque, aka, Hunter Hearst Helmsley is going to do?  Go to Disneyland?  Stay in a Holiday Inn Express?  Save a ton of money by switching to Geico?  Get swarmed by some bees whilst drinking a Stacker2 Y2Stinger?  Hell no...   HHH vs Bill Goldberg (World Heavyweight Title)  --  C'mon...did you really think Goldberg was going to hang around that long?  There's a chance that he may stick around long enough to do a match with Stone Cold at WrestleMania XX, but who knows...if I'm wrong about the outcome of this natch, then Pedro can choose whatever punishment he wants on me!    HHH takes the 10lbs of Gold back.Goldberg vanishes.   There you have it.  Tune in next week too see how right or wrong I was...
