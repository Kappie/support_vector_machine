So, the Kerry campaign is embracing "real American values" which apparently consist of vulgar diatribes (because, you know, "Democrats aren't afraid to laugh") and hate filled speeches against Bush.  Sorry, those aren't my values. Oh, and apparently as a non-democrat I have no sense of humor.  Nice generalizations Whoopi. The next time you do something funny, be sure and let me know so I can chuckle appropriately (or laugh with that evil maniac laughter we conservatives use every time we subjugate the poor, cause it's so darned much fun!).   UPDATE:  Even the  urlLink NYT isn't impressed  with the way the "Bash" was handled. More  urlLink here , and  urlLink here .  I hope this story gains some steam. It won't, but I can be hopeful.
