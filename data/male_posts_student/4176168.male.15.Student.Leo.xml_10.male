And if that is not the only thing that is not going well...the Handbook I'm working on for my Church's Summer camp is in desperate need of a cover page, and it almost seems that no one in my church or my handbook team have any artistic skills whatsoever...what does that boil down to? I need to ride shotgun and make my own cover, and if I ineed need to...it will not be pretty...oh boy, this will really make my day...  And what is even more depressing is that I just realized today what many doesn't want to...My summer is half shot!!...only a few more week until I need to sit back down into that classroom and well...learn and achieve...as much as I like reading and writing and other "eductaional" stuff, school is not on my favourt list...(well, not any more)...  Well...what am I going to do with all these stuff?...I guess I can only do them, forget about them and hope for the best...oh well...let's hope the situation changes in the next 24 hours...  Till than...  "You don't know what it is, but it's there...it's like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad" -- Morpheus  Neo...
