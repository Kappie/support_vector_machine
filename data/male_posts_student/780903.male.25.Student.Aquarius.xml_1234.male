From one article: "'A lot of rewriting of history is taking place right now,' echoed Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal Washington think tank tied to organized labor. Since the death of the 40th president at the age of 93 on Saturday, reverent recollections of 'The Gipper' have filled TV news programs, newspapers and magazines. Through anecdote and accolade, Reagan is remembered as the handsome actor who led a conservative revolution in winning landslide elections for two terms as California governor and two more as president. In his later years, the former president became a sort of national grandfather before sinking into the cruel fog of Alzheimer's disease.... 'Stop the sugar-coating,' columnist Joan Vennochi pleaded in the Boston Globe."  Well, you think this bad?  I've uncovered some clips from old newscasts that put the Reagan coverage to shame.  "Good evening, this is Edward R. Murrow.  Sad news from overseas today as Adolf Hitler has passed away at the tender age of 56.  Hitler is best known for designing the autobahn, the greatest interstate highway in the world.  He also loved ice cream.  A sad, sad day.  We've got Hitler confidant Frank Bratwurst on the telegraph with us.  Mr. Bartwurst, are you there?"  "Yes, yes I am."  "How do you feel today?"  "Very sad.  The world has lost a great friend.  No one has ever had a bad word to say about Mr. Hitler."  "Indeed.  Let's take a look at some childhood photos of Mr. Hitler."  [photos -- one of a young boy with a small moustache licking an ice cream cone; the next of a young boy with a small moustache riding on a sled; the next of a young boy with a small moustache herding Jews into a gas chamber.]  "With us now we have some Jews."  "Hello.  Shalom.  Are we on the air?"   "Yes.  What do you have to say about Mr. Hitler, now that he has died?"  "He was wonderful.  He was a friend.  He was meshuggeneh."  "Thank you.  Let's take a look at Mr. Hitler's burial site.  As he requested, his bosy will overlook the scenic Auschwitz concentration camp, where the Jews are being slaughtered at a rate of ten thousand per day."  [photo of burial site]  And that's not all... here's a clip from 1801.  "Good evening, this is Tom Brokaw.  Sorry to interrupt this week's episode of Little Hut on the Frontier, but I have some terribly sad news to report.  Noted American Benedict Arnold has passed away at the age of 60.  Benedict Arnold, dead at 60.  Despite an incident during the Revolution, Arnold had an extraordinary military career and the nation will mourn the loss of this great man..."
