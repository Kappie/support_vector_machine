Not only that, but... aww hell I'm not gonna start one of those teacher slaying sessions again. But if you've heard me ranting and raving in the past few days, then take a look at the title of this post and you'll get what I was about to say. My mom left a message on her machine asking her to call so she could defend me. So far, no call. Heh, my mom can actually be cool every now and then.
