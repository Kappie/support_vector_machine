But anyways.. this concert thing.. i don't have a ride anymore.. cuz Sarah can't go cuz of her sister's bachelorette party... so all i know is its @ the Saginaw FireFighters Hall.. and its $5 to get in.. doors open @ 6... i dono how long it goes.. but we could probably just leave @ like 11 or something... but i dono.. i have no ride.. :-(
