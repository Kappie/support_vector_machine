Going from a production in which the entire cast was close to one where to be honest at least half the people go out of their way to take the Michael Douglas, and I'm only not scared of one person there (ie. Scott), it's a bit different. Oh well. I'm a whiny son-of-a-vixen sometimes.  I am really tired and peut-Ãªtre un petit peu disheartened. Never mind.  Quote of the day: "The heat is on in Saigon, The girls are hotter than hell, One of these slits here will be Miss Saigon, God the tension is high, not to mention the smell."
