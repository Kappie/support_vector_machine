That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."  ‘To kill a mocking bird’ is a slow starter. You have a rough time in the beginning wondering what the story is trying to tell you and what the title is all about. After all, you have great expectations from the book right from the start knowing that it’s a Pulitzer Prize winner and a lot of reputation behind it. However, by the time you have reached the end of the book, you are more than satisfied.   It is the story of simple people with simple beliefs – some right, some wrong, some good, some bad, some kind and some harsh. It is a book which challenges the moral beliefs that so many of us take for granted as axioms.  The narrator of the story is Scout, the daughter of Atticus Finch, a criminal defense attorney in the Deep South who is assigned to defend a black man in his trial for raping a white girl. The novel tells the story of how Scout and her family endure the threatening ridicule from their community for Atticus' loyalty to this man.   While Harper Lee delivers the message that black people were discriminated against in the Deep South, the more notable message was the struggle that Atticus Finch has to put up when he chooses to side with the truth. The character of Atticus is not so difficult to identify with. He is a simple man with the courage to stand up for the ideals that he believes in. Such people do exist, in numbers greater than we generally believe.   Perhaps, the greatness of the story lies in its narration through the innocent eyes of young Scout. Unlike most other critically acclaimed novels, ‘To kill a mocking bird’ is not depressing or hard hitting. It delivers its message in a simple manner, without disrupting the peace of mind of the reader.
