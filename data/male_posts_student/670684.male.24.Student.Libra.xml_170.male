I think I've talked about my problems cheering for Texas in anything.  I can't bring myself to do it.  I've been pushing upset every game so far, and I'll be cheering for Syracuse tomorrow.  There's support for the notion that we spend our adult lives reconciling childhood issues.  I can't cheer for my current institution.
