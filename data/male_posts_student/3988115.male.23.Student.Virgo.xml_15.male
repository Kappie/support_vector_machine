You see, I have another theory about how humanity can be subdivided, which I came up with in the 11th grade. It involves their reaction to the following statement said in the following way:  "There was this guy (said just a little bit raunchily, but not too much)...(dramatic pause of about a second)...Heate his shit (extend the word "shit" and phrase the sentence in clear iambs. It helps if you raise your eyes a little as you proceed and allow your voice to become raspy. The whole process should flow like a gathering storm). People are guaranteed to react in one way or another.   Type A: Type A will laugh and always laugh. Sometimes they will find it funny, other times strange, but always amused.   Type B: Type B reactions will vary greatly, but the test subject will never laugh. They may look quizzical, vaguely disgusted, annoyed by your profanity, or presumably other, undocumented results.   I have my theories about what exactly being a type one or a type 2 means--perhaps one type is more able to find humor in a cruel world, better adjusted to hearing descriptions of disturbing behavior, or they themselves have been there. I encourage you all to test this hypothesis on your loved ones,andguaranteethat you will be surprised by how they fall out by type .
