Se continues to reject  him as he tries to be more than friends. Leaving mr. Rogers quite angry and  testy. I don’t like this because mr Rogers are a nice guy and shouldn’t waste his  time and money like that. He's like a boyfriend except he doesn't get any, which  is dumb because why else would bother? Oh mrs Rogers likes him but not in the way  he wants. So Mr Rogers continues to try, while I act as boarish as ever. Sometimes I'm glad people don’t like me.
