And i think its quite balanced.(kery being gay, and bush using voodoo.)  And I have seen all i really wanna see of Mr. Moore. He likes to get things wrong and then call it a (truth documentary?). This aint the place to argue though.  I got back from sunny north georgia(like 5 mins from south carolina border) and would like to report that not only did i get georgia peaches, but also sweet tea.  ill develope the pictures later.  now back to chocobo breeding ...  And by the way, use this tage so you dont mess up the side bar  img height=300 src=html width=400 /
