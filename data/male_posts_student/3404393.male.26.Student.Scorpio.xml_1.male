Of those four years we have only been physically present in the same city or area approximately 9 months. And it never fails that either or both of us is asked, "How do you do it?"  I always answer the same way, "Love, Trust, Self-Control". That's all it takes. If you or someone you know doesn't seem to be able to handle long distance relationships, then you (or him/her) is missing one of these elements. It's as simple as that.  Do I miss my girlfriend when we're not together? Definately, more than you can imagine. Do I trust her not to mess around with other guys? Absolutely. Does she trust me? Absolutely. Does it take a massive amount of self-control to resist the temptation of talking to other girls/guys whatever your case may be? You bet.  Is it worth it?  You have no idea...  I realized that the friends of mine who couldn't stick it out were, basically, wimps. They didn't want to do what it took to actually keep the relationship strong and growing. In other words, they didn't really care for the other person, were unwilling to committ to them or afraid of getting hurt - either way it amounts to the same thing.  Does that mean Long Distance Love doesn't work? No. It means those people were lazy and selfish. That's the hard, cold truth people. I'm sorry if you don't like it.  Jonathan
