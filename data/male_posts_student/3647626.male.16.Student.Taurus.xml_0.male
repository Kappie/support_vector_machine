One of them i went to a pool and had alot of fun. ok i gave a way which one was boring but I don't think anyone would get mad (hopefully). The pool party was fun and i ate too much of the cake so I think the Grad student mom disliked me becuse she was eyeing me. So I stopped. Both parties had their advantage though. The first one i went to everyone knew me so i didnt feel left out but the second one i was kinda ignored. boo hoo goodbye for now kiddies ill be back soon
