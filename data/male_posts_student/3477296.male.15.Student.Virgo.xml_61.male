I blame this on the government, they should put more money into the olympic park venues, yeah i kno they're pretty much redundant but i don't care. They should at least keep hot showers going for people who go there regularly like me. I'm stressing over the amount of homeword, assessment task and test that i have managed to rack up over the past 2 weeks. Somehow, by no fault of my own,  i find myself trying to complete them all this weekend as they're due next week.
