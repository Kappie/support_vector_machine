The New York Post's Jonathan Foreman visited MoveOn.org's anti-Schwarzenegger rally Friday and offers a quote that pretty much sums it up:    *** QUOTE ***    The most honest thing I heard came from film producer and Codepink activist Patricia Foulkrod. She admitted that Bill Clinton's sexual peccadilloes were as inexcusable as Arnold's. "The difference is that Clinton was so brilliant," she said. "If Arnold was a brilliant pol and had this thing about inappropriate behavior, we'd figure a way of getting around it. I think it's to our detriment to go on too much about the groping. But it's our way in. This is really about the GOP trying to take California in 2004 and our trying to stop it."    *** END QUOTE ***
