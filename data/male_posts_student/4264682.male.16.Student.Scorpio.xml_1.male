The Cubs game was a heck of a game (they beat the Brewers in 11 innings).  Nomar Garciaparra had a really good game, too, with 3 doubles.  Come on, they've gotta make the playoffs.  On another note, I've done so much driving lately, I'm rather sick of it.  Driving to Chicago, driving to Milwaukee, and driving for work have worn me out.  Kudos to anyone who identifies the band, song, and album that this post's title comes from.  Today, I went to a mall in Indiana and picked up a copy of the Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien.  It's pretty good.  I'll post again tomorrow.  Tchao.
