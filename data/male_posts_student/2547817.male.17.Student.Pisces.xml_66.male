I was just thinking, tag me so that I know you were here. Yeah... I'd feel slightly more appreciated.  I'm glad to know Desiree. I've got her to thank for my mood picking up. It's not T-shirt weather just yet for me both literally and metaphysically, I've still got issues to deal with. But! I'm getting better. Happy songs are nice.  I've decided to better myself as part of my "Tim's gonna get good" plan. I just typed in "Tim's gonna get up" but deleted it coz it was... err.. hehe... OK! STOP SMILING ALREADY! DIRTY PEOPLE... HMPH! So anyway, as part of my plan, it'll be a one day body one day music thing. My mark for physique is none other than  El Royale   Mr Leon Oei . Oh man!! When I bold his name, HTML puts "strong" beside his name! hahahah!!!! Yes ladies, Leon's a hot bod... You gotta see it to believe it. As for musicality, my benchmark, who else but  Foong .  I got a SMS from Nepal 2 days ago. Seng regrettedly informed me that Zel tore her ankle while they were hiking to a primary school because she tripped on a log and her weighty pack bag pulled her down, thus resulting in catastrophic injury. That went all wrong, but you get what I mean... So I was hell worried and panicked and all like the wuss I am called her mother, who by the way HATES me, to inform her. Obviously she got worried too and requested that I tell them to inform her directly... Wow! I called her mom... 45 minutes later I got a call telling me that it was a prank. Apparently she was talking to Seng and dared him to find out what I would be like if he told me that she'd injured herself. Hurah! Well, I'm glad she sill knows I love her enough to DIE by calling her mum. We cleared things up with her mom...  I'm pissed with Chris and Sarah for not sticking up for me at the Sec 2 camp. Cost me 2 good days of fun. Damn... Shan't elaborate.  Spoke to Aziz, Sufian and Hazwan today about Islam. I'm  SHOCKED  by the parallels that can be drawn with Christianity. Now I question, Which Faith is a real faith and which is the blind faith.  There's more, but IF You've read up till here, Thank you. It means something special to me.
