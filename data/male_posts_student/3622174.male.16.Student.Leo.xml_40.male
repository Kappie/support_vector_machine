We'll start off with our Photoshop trick.   Removing Red Eye   This and all Photoshop tricks come from the Digital Imaging Guide, provided by the Walsworth Publishing Company from their Camp Orlando seminar in July 2003.  Here's the first trick, how to remove Red Eye.  Step 1: Open your image in Adobe Photoshop.  Step 2: Zoom in.  Select the Zoom tool from the Tool Palette, and place the tool over the left area of the red eye.  Click and drag to form a selection over the eye, and that area will fill the screen.  Step 3: Desaturate Color.  Select the paintbrush tool from the tool palette.  In options, select mode to Color, and Opacity at 100%.  Select a brush from the Brushes palette that is around the diameter of the iris of the red eye.  Click D on the keyboard to set foreground and background colors to Default.  Click and paint over the red portion of the eye.  Step 5: Save your Image.  It's that simple.  You can also apply different colors, and check back later today to find out how to do that.  And now, on to today's site of the day, the Hollywood Stock Exchange. -------------------------  The Lowdown-Hollywood Stock Exchange  Have you ever wanted to purchase your favorite actor?  Well, now you can with the Hollywood Stock Exchange.  This site allows you to invest fake money into actors, actresses, movies, and other things.  You get H$1,000,000 when you start off, and depending on what moves you make, that can go up or down.    I've been playing this game for about a year (under various accounts, since I keep forgetting my password), and it's a ton of fun.  Buying your moviestocks and starbonds is incredibly easy.  You can buy as many shares as you want to, then, wait until they get really high up, and then sell them to get more money.  Or, you can hang onto them, if you think that they are going to go up even higher.    If you refer a friend to the Hollywood Stock Exchange, you get a certain amount of H$, and there are other opportunities to earn extra credit every week, like a weekly poll (which gives you H$50,000), and others.  It's really interesting, it's a cool way to make more H$, and it's a lot of fun.  The Hollywood Stock Exchange is byfar one of the better sites that I have reviewed so far.  It can be seen as a game, but, I have other plans for a Game of the Day today, so, deal with it.  All you have to do is go to www.hsx.com and sign up, and you're all set to go.  Definite recommendation from me.     urlLink    The Hollywood Stock Exchange allows you to invest fake money into movies and movie stars.  urlLink      Pros  +Invest in your favorite movies, stars, etc. +Easy to use +Nice interface +H$1,000,000 on the spot when you sign up.
