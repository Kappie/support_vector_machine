But nope, got boring, so I watched some TV. Spongebob or Jackie Chan's animated series. Oh boy, what a choice.  So I decided to go and get my crappy little speakers out of the car (took 'em on holiday) so atleast now I can listen to my music nice and loud, instead of on the crappy laptop speakers.  I hope this evening is more eventful. Anyway, who knows, maybe tomorrow will be fantastic. Although if it's like the others, it will only come in the "Pretty cool" Catagory.      UPDATE: Nope, nothing happend this evening. Went on the  urlLink Jengajam  IRC. Quite quiet really.
