I'm like "dude, no need, afterall I didn't take your wisdom teeth out, Dr. Whatshisface did."  But I like being owed shit anyway, so more power to that.  (jk, u owe me nothing good buddy).  WEED EATING- it's what I've been doing with my life.  I've been pulling up, ripping out, and discarding the weeds that don't need to be around.  Be them people (*ahem* former "friends" who I now realize were not worth my time if 5 min. after I'm out of their sight they have no balls to continue contact with me - not to mention their asinine behavior and attitudes, but that's a whole different story.) or situations, schedules, etc that aren't healthy for me.  I like doing this yard work of life.  It's rewarding to me.  In the last couple of months I have seen things in my "yard" flourish because of it.  When the things that drag you down are gone, suddenly new things can take their place that are rewarding and fulfilling.  The meaning of friendship has really been shown to me lately and I am so thankful for it.  I realize who the people are in my life that MATTER to me, and care about me 100%, and I know that I care about them the same way.  I love that.  Some friends (back to the *ahem* friends) that were in my past were simply good-time friends it seems.  When things are rough, they disappear.  Selfishly claiming no fault because, afterall, I can just as well stay in contact with them.  I never want to have people like that in my life again.  When I'm hurting over something, I want to know my friends will be there for me just as I would be there for them, no questions asked.    In the past several weeks alone, I have realized the rewards of being there for people I care about and the bond that it forms.  Not because it makes me feel so good to have been there, but rather because I go out on a limb for certain people because I KNOW that they would and will do the same for me.  In thinking back on these mentioned friendships of convenience and selfishness, I am just as guilty I assume for sticking around.  I am so glad to not be in that place anymore.  No one is perfect but bonds of friendship and trust are important to me, and I am happy to understand those things now, to be proud of the relationships I have built and am building and most importantly surround myself with the people that are going to have the balls to call me on a bad day.  Be in contact with individuals who are as concerned with my well being as I am with theirs.    *sigh* so much is changing and so much is great inside of those changes that I can't stop smiling about it.  Life is exciting right now and a little scary too.  Scary like when you ride a rollercoaster, it's just going to be fast, fun, and will leave me pissing myself with excitement.  I hope when I get off this ride I look back and say "I wanna go again!"  Spring break is almost over, and I seem to be packed with plans.  I seem to have something going on everyday followed by EVERY night.  SO much for studying over the break.  I don't mean to neglect you baby, by the way, you know I love you.  I'm glad we're having plans on Friday!  :)  Can you believe I just called you baby?  Reminds me of former roommate.  Mmmmm Mullets.  Speaking of plans on Friday, I'm pumped.  I know that they might not work out, in case you need to spend time with the brother, but if they do, I'm thrilled.  I want to hang out with him too!  Why don't I just write you a personal e-mail because this is what this has turned into.  Sorry,all you others.  If you'd start leaving me some damn comments I'd respond to them and maybe YOU TOO could get included in the festivities of my posting.  Shout out to Elise ("shout out?"  K, Mason, thanks for the TRL moment) for reading my blog and commenting from time to time.  You rock for that.  I know we have only shared one beer together in our lives, but it's nice to know you're around and following the days of my life.    This is seriously going no where.  I need to rest up before I go to my trainer.  Let the pain begin.  Ciao
