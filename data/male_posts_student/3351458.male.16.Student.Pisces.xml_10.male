I’m not entirely sure though if I’d like the board minus the seniors, some of whom are really cool guys and are people I respect. Of course, there are also some seniors who are not that great, but I have to say, Discipline Commission has the best, the most hip and the most "happening" (to borrow a phrase from a friend) of all prefects. As I type this, I’ve just returned from a farewell outing. A brilliant farewell outing which, although beset by petty problems such as lack of food ( hehe !), could be considered an overall success, thanks to the stuff we did and the crap we talked. First of all, there was the “affirmation” time, where everyone could just say anything they liked about the commission. Naturally, I thanked my senior, who was also mentioned in almost every single prefect's affirmation speech. I personally feel glad I did get the senior I got, coz’ he was without a shadow of doubt the absolute, single most “lepak” prefect in the entire Form 5. He took everything with an easy attitude, and we talked about anything and everything ( even when there wasn’t really anything to talk about ). He also had hopes of me to be among those to pass the first batch. He also got me out of the “ragging” business after telling his buddies not to disturb me and covered my back over a whole lot of less than flattering things about me. Thanks again, Adrian. Owe you a lot. Disco will also be remembered for a personal reason. The first time I've ever managed to complete conversations with females in many, many, many years was during compilation meetings (yes, I am that pathetic). Of course, what outing would be complete without the traditional bombing of other commission outings? Why, none, of course. Our commission went over to a rival commission’s outing spot in a couple of cars right smack at 10.30pm and started chucking a whole lot of water balloons at them. Two minutes later, we realized they had a nice, powerful water pipe. At three minutes, the retaliations kept coming in fast and hard. At the fourth minute, we realized we were out of ammo (another thing caused by lack of organization) while the enemy was just beginning. At four and a half minutes, the entire Discipline Commission was effectively retreating. At five minutes, we were dying… More weapons were brought out. Eggs. Flours. At about ten minutes, half of all Disco members were busy being blur outside the war zone, while the other half were busy being hit by a whole lot of soapy water and flour. At fifteen minutes, the reinforcements from the Cleanliness Commission came in.  Disco  charged in again. After half-an-hour, war was over. Peace reigned once again (heheh!). I do not doubt that the various car drivers that passed the war zone, actually a house compound, thought a gangfight was in progress. I mean, it isn’t often you see a whole bunch of people gathering outside a house, busy chucking things in and out while running all over the neighbourhood, yelling and screaming. The end of a generation... We’ll never see the same seniors in our Commission again. It was fun while they were around and unfortunately, the future of Disco’s status as being the most “happening” commission around doesn’t look so bright. Well, no matter… anyone for a water balloon war? I like it...   -Discipline Commission 2004-
