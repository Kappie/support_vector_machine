Still remember her waving a copy of dataquest (i think) with her dads pic on it on the cover way back in 1996, when we were in PUC. I still remember having that feeling , ok so what if his pic is on the cover of a mag ? (notta lotta stuff interest me .. in some ways i still havent changed )  I guess thats why I never wanted to work for that company....... damn now i know why i never wanted to work there .. cos i had made a resoultion that i wouldnt work there . lol ... phew its a releif whe u suddely remember stuff . I didnt think t was right for me to work under my peer. weird how your m1nd thinks when yer a 16 year old . Imust admint that i did go for an interview , but i didnt get selected ( yeah i cursed god for a while .. cos i needed a better paying job at that juncture... looking back, i cant explain it.. i guess sometimes wishes do come true )
