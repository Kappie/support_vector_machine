Today's Paul's birthday so I want everyone to know it's his birthday, he wants to keep it secret. Ok... vacation, it sucks because coach has to be gay and all and make practices and meets during the vacation. I hate track, I shuda never joined, wow I havent blogged in a while. Well I don't know what I'm doing this vacation, I'm gonna be bored alot. I bought my room furniture today but rug I didn't get to yet. Then at night, I went to the movies with Jared, Toni and Jackie. We saw The Core... weird movie. Some of it seems a little farfetched. Ok Bye.
