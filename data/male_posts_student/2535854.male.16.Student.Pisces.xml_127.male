So started the computer test thingy..or the Adobe Illustrator crap..the practicals are next week..damn gotta finish the Adobe Illustrator crap by Friday..damn damn damn..think i`ll stay back on Thursday or something and do it..Had two extra boring but at least free to do almost anything periods of chemistry cause the test paper was being reviewed and 1 free period of accounts woohoo!But now got lots of BM work to do man!Damn!  So the time table`s changed!No more English this week!Yay!And have accounts..yay!But it hasn`t really changed that much...In fact I belive the Friday schedule hasn`t even changed a bit!To bad En. Ramsah isn`t teaching Physics anymore..his classes are fun..although he smell likes hes been wearing  'Calvin Klein`s Dumpster For Him' .Lol.He really smells awful!And as usual,Afandi was clowning around in class..haha..he lost money like mad betting Italy vs Denmark give 1 goal..Aiya I shoulda taken the bet!I`d be ten bucks richer!haha..but nevermind..kesian him..haha..  So sejarah I got only 60%!I could I?And I got 78/100 for paper 2!Only missed out on 11 marks for the structure questions!And also 11 marks looking at it for essay!So good eh ;-)?Hehe..but damn..my bad part was the objective paper...only 22/40 correct!But the objective paper is memang damn hard...I feel its the hardest part of the paper!The essays so simple cause I can remember it from form 3 studying for PMR that time and all last year..hehehe..So I didn`t study that much except for the begging hehe...But Somehow I think there`s been a miscalculation of my marks for history..when I go to school tommorow,I`m so gonna double check my paper and how the marks are totalled up!I cant belive got just that much for all that?Hmm..interesting eh?  So that problem Shaun has kinda happened after school..I`m not gonna say what it is..find it out for yourselves..he can be said to have escaped this time perhaps.Hmm I think that now perhaps there`s gonna be an emergancy assembly about this.I`m sure someone would complain about like five guys in street clothes talking to a student in a quiet corner on the lower ground floor..damn..hope not!  So betting with Afandi Holland vs Germany..i`m Holland..square game...haha..  Sarah want`s me to get her a coffee maker :P.hahaha..maybe I will?hehe!But I need money 1st though!haha..And Eric got Farouq that new Nokia N-Gage QD or is it QPD?Oh whatever!From Japan!Bugger!Cheaper there though it seems..not surprised..with the technology they have over there,it should be cheap but not over here with the standard of technology here :p.  Ok anyway i`m crapping..gonna sleep now..then wake up for the Germany and Holland game!Later!  Riz.
