Our country is still locked in political debates of controversial nature and even more controversial subject matter.  But still nobody is able to effectively utilize a good protest.  Why is that?  It seems we have a lot of things to blame.  First of all, there are no rallying point causes anymore.  The only thing anybody cared about was the war.  But that's essentially over.  what we need is bra-burning, social issue protests.  But unfortunately, nobody seems to give a shit about gay marriage, which seems to be quickly becoming the social issue of the current generation.  Our politicians avoid it.  Christians abhor it.  It's just that sort of issue that everyone either is apathetic about, or against.    Not me though.  I e-mailed the white house about it.  They responded somewhere along these lines:  "Thank you for your interest in white house policy.  We read each letter carefully, and take it into account."  Bullshit.  You know That they have a special e-mail address for important people.  Important people like Jerry Falwell, that is.  - Mike "Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam" dickerson.
