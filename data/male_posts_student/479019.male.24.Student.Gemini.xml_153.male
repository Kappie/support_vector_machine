The only benefit is being able to squeeze in more hours and I could use the money.   I also booked my flight out to Binghamton today. I leave Irvine on the 28th of August. That's only a little over a month away... A lot of people have been asking me if I'm excited. I don't know what it is I feel. I'm not exactly an exciteable person. I am looking forward to a new life as a graduate student though.  In rotation today is  Bad Religion 's  Process of Belief .  ***
