NEVER BEEN BETTER!!!  - oh i'm so glad because everything is back to normal. it was just 15 mins ago when i wrote how i feel towards my friend and the situation we've got into but now i can't compare the happiness that i'm feeling because we're ok now. i didn't know that she was online all the time i was writing on how i feel. she pm so that's how i figured out that she was online. i was shocked that she pm me w/ a msg that seems nothing is wrong between us. i told her that i was really sorry about and she told me that everything was ok. that was the time that i really got off with the uncertain feeling. then i told her that if she reads the blog that i wrote, just regard it since everything was ok between us. then we chatted about it and we used the cry smiley as if we're crying!!! wahahaha!!! i really feel good now!!! thank god!!! i really couldn't affor to loose a very special friend...    THE WORST FEELING EVER...  - i don't know how to feel toward this friend of mine. should i also be mad or just be patient and wait for the time to calm her hatred or unpleasant feeling to me.? i think this friend of mine is mad at me because of an unpleasant situation that has happened 2 days ago. i really didn't mean it to happen. the problem was already solved because the thing that i ACCIDENTALLY and DIDN'T mean to DELETE was finally retrieved back because i really did all i can to make this friend happy. i even called at their house to say that it was already back but still i feel that this friend of mine is still not in the mood confronting me. actually i think this friend is "making iwas" to me because after logging in at ym, this friend readily logged-off that made me feel that this friend doesn't want to chat w/ me even though i was in invisible mode. to tell the truth and no offense i really don't like very sensitive people (i'm not saying that this friend im referring to is a sensitive person. i just want to say how i feel about a sensitive kind of person...) because they get easily upset in an unwanted situation. to tell frankly, i'm also a sensitive person because like what i said, i easily get upset in an UNWANTED SITUATION but i'm getting over w/ it once i feel bad in a situation that i don't like to be involved. *sighs..... i really hope that everything will be back to normal because i love this friend of mine and one of my closest.
