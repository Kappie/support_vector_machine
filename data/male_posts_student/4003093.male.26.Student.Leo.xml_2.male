The idea is, when a driver gets a traffic ticket. Instead of having to go and wait for a trial for paying a fine. The driver can plead guilty and just pay the damn thing online (through a credit card, or even a bank transfer).     It's not a new idea ( urlLink http://www.gov.ab.ca/home/index.cfm?Page=754 ). Others have used it. I believe it would be a good idea to implement it in Indonesia.     The advantages of this approach:        Cuts down on the number of police corruption (well, theoretically of course). The offender does not have to go to court. Thus it won't be any easier to pay the police off than paying to the court (it may be cheaper, but it won't be easier).      Cuts down on the number of illegal intermediary in court (calo/makelar). Since payment is direct and quick. Intermediaries are not needed.      More time for judges to do other things. Like giving death penalties to corruptors.     Some lucky group of IT developers will get money. What more do you want?       The main purpose of this system is of course to cut down the corruption in Indonesia. Ironically, the developers will probably have to make a big pay-off to people in the government to get this project rolling...
