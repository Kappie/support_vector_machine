What one singer/musician can you not stand? Why? Eminem. Why? Because he is a white man trying to live in a black man's world. I'm not racist, but come on. You arn't black, act your god damn color! 3. If your favorite singer wasn't in the music business, do you think you would still like him/her as a person? I dunno. Probably not. 4. Have you been to any concerts? If yes, who put on the best show? Yes, I would have to say Ray Charles, just because he is like a music legond. 5. What are your thoughts on downloading free music online vs. purchasing albums? Do you feel the RIAA is right in its pursuit to stop people from dowloading free music? I think if you download a song or two from a cd, to preview the cd is fine. I mean, if I have never heard of an artist before, am I gonna go out and pay $20 - $40 for a new cd? Hell no. I'm gonna download the music first to preview the cd. I think the RIAA can go to hell. If it wasn't for KaZaA and other P2P Networks, some little known artists wouldn't have become well known, like Jason Mraz. Look at him now. How did he get his start? KaZaA. So, RIAA, suck my left boob.
