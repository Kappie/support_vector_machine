Me waking up late in the evening, scrubbing my grill, eatin somethin, doin somethin, watchin somethin, crapping.   But today, something out of the ordinary happened. Seems a lady from colorado called, asking for her friend. Well... I was asleep when she called. So I checked my phones missed calls, and called back, to see who it was. Now her, Linette...Lynnette...however you spell it, had a strange conversation, of her talking, and me going, oh word, oh ferreal, oh i see. Now this went on for a solid 5 minutes, until she went...  "Well I can tell youre busy, I'll let you go, talk to you later..."  Now I'm thinkin, HELL NA i jus wanted to kno who called. Well, thats my day.  It's late in the evening now. And I went to the living room to watch some more tapes. And what I found, was a tape from my third grade class back in Fairfield, Ca. 1997 Mrs. Paxton's Third Grade Class H. Glenn Richardson Elementary. Puppet Plays. I remember back in that class, every year, Mrs. Paxton would have puppet plays. And it was our year. We made puppets from that would topple over any sesame street sucka. Man, I was chunky back them. What a pimp... If you know me, you should come over to my house, and we can watch it. And I'll laugh....  anyways, peep this link, GHETTO K.O.  urlLink http://www.muchosucko.com/video-ghettoko.html   Today's Message From Erwin: Kids drink ya drugs, and dont do milk.
