And the same ones who liked singing loudly in their scratchy demented voice to anything by the venga boys late at night for a few years. Yes, they are fun to live next to: i particularly like it when they start shouting abuse at policemen living near by from their garden at 2 in the morning. but they are going and unless the people moving in are untrained monkeys who like throwing their own excrement and listen to white noise at 130 decibels then it cant be much worse.   However we have a long history of weird/dodgy neighbours. The best was a family who had a kid called Christian: he tried to steal my tricycle and when we stole it back and chained it to a ladder he tried to steal it again (he was about 7 years old), also the family were in some deep financial trouble so they told everyone they were moving to new zealand but instead just hid in their house for a few months. The other interesting family were the ones who stole all our tennis balls whenever they landed near their house and before they left went mental at us because our pond had supposedly flooded their garden (the pond was still full of water and so we had to break the news that the reason everything was wet was because it had rained; they werent happy)   wow, i can see that loads (13) people have visited and one person has even RETURNED, hopefully because they liked it and not because they were collecting evidence to file a lawsuite against me for telling people to break into someone elses house.
