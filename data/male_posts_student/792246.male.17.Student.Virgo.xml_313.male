The former is taught by Barkley, who is supposed to be pretty damn cool. The other one was picked because it is the only other class that sounded vaguely interesting that doesn't have too much work. I'm not in the mood to be writing papers this summer.  So yeah, two hopefully not hard classes that will be easy A's. 8 units worth at that. Sexy.  I'm going to New York for a week at the end of July. Then I'm free for most of August. Not full. Damn damn damn. Maybe I'll try and get a job somewhere for just August.  I'm turning 18 on August 26th! Very shortly after that, it's looking promising for me to actually go to Israel finally! Woot! I return from that sometime in September, I kill the rest of that time, and then Fall Quarter starts on the 20 somethingth.  Other things that need to be accomplished: a) Barbeque b) Beach party c) Hot tub party
