I describe myself as a moody girl, sometimes noisy, oftentimes quiet, sometimes I do childish acts, and sometimes I act as a teen. Despite my being moody, I can also be sweet and friendly. Some people describe me that I am intelligent, and a good dancer. Some say I’m pretty and I believe that I am pretty.Ü People say that I’m a snob, maybe because I’m just really quiet. Like all people, I have my hobbies. As for me, I like making friends, texting, chatting, surfing the net, reading books or magazines, listening to all kinds of music, watching movies, talking over the phone, I like road trips and traveling a lot, I love the color baby blue, and particularly, I love hanging out anywhere just as long as I’m with my friends or my cousins. I also love taking care of my nephew and my sister and my other cousin. Whenever I am with them, especially when I’m in the right mood, I play with them and I watch television with them. We love Nickelodeon, Disney and Cartoon Network. I also love to smile!Ü But most of all, I am a simple girl living a simple life and having a simple dream.ÜüÜ
