Two hours of random "FQLEH!" "SPCUEEEUGH!" "FWLPWIBBIB!" shouting, along with laughing at Belgian spelling (the new name for typos. Also, Jehan "Big boss Veynom" Snyers d'Attenhoven has been declared the God of typos/Belgian spelling). And managed to get a fair bit of work done, too. And I'm still in a good mood from last night...ahhhhh.  One thing that did go wrong was that Harnet managed to completely feck up what I had planned for after school. Bah. Not exactly his fault, but he still managed to do the most annoying thing to me since the Barber/Bishop paper flicking campaign ended. Bahbahbah. And I still need to find the rest of the words to the Noddy theme tune...so cool...
