It's great, people get the idea that I'm pissed and I don't seem as unrefined. It's like a half-win, win situation, which I guess would be a 3/4 win situation.  Anyway, nothing happened today. I woke up at like 7AM after going to bed at like 4AM reinstalling my OS after accidentally breaking the kernel to oblivion. Man, I was tired last night. I was looking through my directories and finding out what needed to replaced when I thought "damn, I'm really tired. My eyes are closing by themselves and my fingers are sitting on the keys when they should be floating... I want to sleep but I have to get this done so that tomorrow morning I will think it never happened." And then it hit me "Man, I am a now a loser along more than one axis. I broke my kernel because I didn't know how to 'fix' it 'properly', I obviously have no social life becuase I'm sitting in front of a black console with green text at 4AM, and I don't know my limit. This sucks." But then I changed my perspective. I was like "Hmm, perhaps I'm not as big a loser as I thought. I actually TRIED to understand my computer better and break it without damaging it. A lot can be said for people who are brave enough to try. I mean, you can never learn without trying and failing miserably, right?" And then I felt a bit better for being an idiot.  Ok, I went off on a tangent. After waking up, my sister, the most productive little daemon on earth decided that early morning is the right time to watch the movie "In America". I, being tied down to the room with the TV in it, was forced to watch it and found it to be actually quite enjoyable but would have rather done something more useful like study for those SAT's which are on June 5th. Please pray for me >_  Alright, so I'm standing there, right, just brushing my teeth when my sister, J, decides that her hair can't wait and that she NEEDS the only mirror/sink in the house. I wouldn't have needed the mirror for brushing on most days and would have just gone to the kitchen sink but today was different. I needed the mirror because I was trying to popcorn kernels out of my gums and braces (very nice image, i know. Reeeaal appitizin'). So, pissed off, J decides to punch my shoulder-blade with the tip of her index and middle fingers. She called it poking, but really, a poke doesn't hurt for 2 minutes after. Anyway, I punched her back on the outside of her shoulder and then, resenting it, punched my back, but this time on the top of my back so that my head jerked forward pushing the plastic part of the toothbrush into my gum. One word, Ow. So I punched her back and then she punched me back harder so I punched her back harder. She just kept getting angrier and angier that I kept hitting her back and then all of a sudden she unleashed the knees and shins and toes of fury of my shins, upper thiegh, chest, and almost that special place >_  After that whole exchange, I asked for money and left to work. At work, I masked and ate. While out eating I met this dude. He was a cool dude, a guitar playing dude who wrote songs and played them in Westwood Village. So I gave him a couple bucks and asked him to play a song and then I found out where he was playing and I hope to see him there. Then I went back to work and masked some more. After that I went to silly Kaplan for my silly SAT course. After that I caught a bus home and watched some TV, talked to Peter, ate some stuff, and started writing this post.  In conclusion, most of this post was boring. I'd say that the best parts were the first 2 paragraphs and the part about the fight with my sister, but that's just me. I probably just like it because I finally got to gripe about J :-). Thank you for reading a possibly semi-interesting reflection, and a almost certainly boring log... I guess that gives new meaning to Blog :-P.  That is all.         -- Feanor
