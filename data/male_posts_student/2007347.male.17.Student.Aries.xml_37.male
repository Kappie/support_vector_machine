The movies almost 7 years old, if you haven't seen it now your not going to.)  Its major problem is that we've seen it all before, and the director knew this. Note in all the other movies someone tells you about the Aliens, like introduces the species, but no such talk we made, we already know! We already know the 'blood' is corrosive, so were not surprised when wheelchair guy gets it on him and it burns!     On the whole the movie sucked but there were a few points that were raised were quite cool, Call, the Robot whose more human than humans was quite cool. And for the first part your thinking, damn she's not bad (Winona Ryder) then when you find out, everyone including you is saying "OH! Yuck Robot Sex!" Also the Newborn Alien has human emotions, which is quite cool, but of course they kill it anyway cause the humans characters are  inhumane.   I think it was this and the lovable characters like Call, The wheelchair guy and guy with Alien foetus. Reminded me of some of the characters from Aliens (2nd one) The "Game Over man, Game over" Guy, he had mad skills.  But something piss me off about the movie, why 200 years in future? Why do the Aliens have corrosive blood? What's the damn point, its meant to circulate nutrients to the cells, what's the point of it burning stuff, and how does the Alien hold the stuff inside it since it eats through a 6 inch block of steel?   Hmmph, stupid Animal diversity lecture. Where he told us next time to pick apart Sci-Fi movies for illogical ideas like that..Hmmpf.
