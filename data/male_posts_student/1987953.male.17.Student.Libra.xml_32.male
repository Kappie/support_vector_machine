Buddy Picture is one of the two pages that distributes the RealPHX trojan horse virus to computers through the website (the other is www.talkstocks.net) which puts the same message on your profile for others to fall for. The only way to get rid of it is to go to:  urlLink http://www.rsaisp.com/software.asp  and follow the directions carefully if in fact you do have/get it. The message with the virus also varies to the message: "Whoa..... look what I found!" or something like it. Thanks for reading this. Be careful! If there is an unspecified link on a profile, ask your friend before clicking it!  In Christ, Mike  "You are talking like a foolish woman...." -Job 2:10 NIV
