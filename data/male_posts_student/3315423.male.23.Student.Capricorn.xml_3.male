We were dispatched to Pangkor Island, one of the most beautiful islands in the world. There were like 50 of us, hoping to have a decent tension releasing session after a hectic semester. But nope, it's almost like an army boot camp. We were thrown into the sea (or the cold river backyard) almost every 6 hours. Every step is a mistake to the trainers. But we enjoy inter-island kayak trip and abseiling from 50ft high rocks. The last 3 day really test our patience. We were not given any food during the hike to find the Pangkor summit. We were only given a map and a compass. First we have to walk all the way to Pantai Pasir Bogak which seems like a journey with no end. Every time we paused for a break, I lay anywhere but on the road and fell asleep right away. At the Pasir Bogak, we have nothing to sleep on, so we sleep on the itchy beach sand. I was awaken by the hyper chilly breeze from the sea, so chilly I thought I’m on vacation in Alaska. Then we were told to find the summit and get back to the camp site before 5pm. guess they would let us go just that huh? No way! They find a faction of time to dip us in the ice cold morning sea water. We manage to find the summit, and head back to camp. The next day is the most beautiful day because its time to go home...
