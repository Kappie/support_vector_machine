Which I did so well with one guess.  3) I had to open the email 4) I had to change the password 5) And Now, I'm here. Writing in your oh so sexy blog.  ;)  For those of you who don't know me, I am the one eyed bandit. Who goes around stealing peoples journals for the hell of it. HAH, no I don't I just wanted to break into Jerry's and write how I'd take advantage of him. 'Cause we all know Jerry's got a little dirrty side to him. [note: the two 'r's)  If Jerry want's though, I don't mind letting him break into my blog. ;) I'd enjoy it.    So anyway, like I told Jerry. Before I broke into his blog. I told him I'd be nice, and he said 'You can just write about how you'd take advantage of me' Yeah, I know he's dirrty, but it's hot! lmao So anyway, I'd take advantage of Jerry any time any day. I don't care where it is, or what the weathers like. Although it can't be in the cold.  ;) Right Jerry? ha   You better not delete this entry when I give you your new password. Cause if you do, I'm going to change it again, and keep your blog for myself. So keep this sucka up here! lol Right, I'm frightening myself, and those of your friends that have a blog will think I'm some sort of nut. But, I'm not really.    Mmm, okay so back to taking advantage of Jerry. -winks- haha, wow, I'm a dirty person. Geesh Jerry, what have you done to me. You've corrupted my mind! You fool!! Hah, okay I'm kidding   Any-ways, I'd like to tare Jerry's clothes off, and have my way with him. Hah, oh yeah.. he'd like it. I know he would. ;)   Haha, hmm.. JERRY IS HOT!    Valerie
