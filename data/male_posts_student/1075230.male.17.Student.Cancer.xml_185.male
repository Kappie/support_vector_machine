After NLS and before school, the only event worth mentioning was my visit to Woodside to participate in the final duel monsters tournament till who-knows-when. The admission was free (and no, we did not have to pay at the door). I won 2 out of 5, which wasn't that bad, considering my previous records at tournaments ^^;;   Anyhow, as school started, 3 new people arrived at Mary Ward... hoshi and dyt were expected, but aiza was a surprise ^^;; i must admit that that plot was hidden well.    There's a huge flood of 9ers and transfer students this year, over 300 9ers... it's crazy. Many resource areas were filled on the first day 0 because of this. Luckily, the Focus room is now opened, but that's besides the point. Oh, and we get to use the auxiliary cafe this year, so that's cool too.    Despite my resolutions to stay on track, I'm doing worse than last year... =\ 0 units handed in on time, and 1 unit done as far. *sigh* hopefully, I'll get back on track. Getting back on track is a must for me. This is also because intramural and varsity chess is starting soon ^^ yay! THis was something that was missing last year.   IF my typing seems bad, it's because I'm not too used to this keyboard... this cordless keyboard and mouse... it's something my sister's bf won for her over a online raffle thingy. THe downside is of course the use of batteries. Personally, I prefer the old kind of keyboard, I rather not invest in this sort of luxury, it's not something I need.   Ah.. Exit -> Running is playing ^^ besides last night, the last time I've heard it was a long time ago. It's one of my fav Slayers songs. 2 new songs I've never downloaded before and liked are Silent Weapon and Brave Heart, both from Shaman King (I'm starting to collect some shaman king songs).    Sorry if I worried people about my sleeping-late habits, but night is when I'm most productive, so I need to crunch out the hours.    ~ Chronos
