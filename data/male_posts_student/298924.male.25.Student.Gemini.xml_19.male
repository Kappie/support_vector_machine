Am I wrong to be happy to be an American?....I mean true, Black men are not favored in American society, but I can't think of another place where I would have the opportunity to make money and live my life the way I want to....can you?  Am I the only 22 year old Black Male who still loves Saved By The Bell?....I will sit and watch any episode no matter how many times I have seen it before....  Speaking of Saved By The Bell, whatever became of Lark Voorhies?....Last I saw her she was making arabesque movies....  I remember once upon a time I had the following celebrity crushes, all around the same time: Halle Berry, Lark Voorhies, Tatyana Ali, Stacey Dash, Veronica Webb, Naomi Campbell, Tyra Banks, Aaliyah (R.I.P. babygirl), Monica, and Brandy (what was I thinking?)....now I'm hard pressed to think of any black celeb I'm attracted to besides the entire female cast of The Best Man (including Shelby, but strangely not Nia Long)....might I be growing up?....naaaaah....  Newsflash....these new J's still feel like Heaven on my feet.....  I feel like a complete and total jackass cuz I forgot about my best friend Eulus's birthday yesterday....granted yesterday was a hectic day....but there is really no excuse....I suck right now....I'll make it up though....  I think that's it for now....
