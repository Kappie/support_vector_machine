So left for there at err like..12pm..arrived at 12:30pm...show started at 1pm..  Im to lazy to say what happened to it cause I didnt 100% enjoy it..  Its quite funny and stuff..but sick in some ways..like when some ass shows up when hes meddling with his tv...thing overal was boring..but the concept and the way its done is very good...although the storylines werre very childish although its likely that theres lotsa kids there..bitches..some harlots were kicking my chair so I refuse to give in..lmao..  Met Jien and Sashya and they intro me to others...those Cheras ppl arent so bad...Well..the ones I met are quite nice...Cecillia who I think is head prefect was like..the show in a censored version and she and Jenny were like..theres something abt a blowjob..wtf??and also met Muiz who the girls are like saying are cute and stuff..es a nice guy as welll...Fazril agreed with me that the things boring like shit a bit to an extent.heh...so lunch with them..1901 stuff...then ciaoed after making them belive I was gonna go in for chem with em..haha..  got home at like 4pm....then did homework and other crap...slept..and thats all for this entry...unless I feel like it,I wont go indepth about the Black Light Theatre.Well just maybe.
