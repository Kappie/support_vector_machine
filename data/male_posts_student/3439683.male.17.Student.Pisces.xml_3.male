My Lord, I am still a boy.”  “My child, you will see her then.”   (chorus) Oh, God, it’s so far away.  “I am timeless. I give you peace.”  Lord, I don’t know if I can last that long.  “I am strong. I give you strength.”  Will she be all I hope for?  “My plan is perfect. Trust Me in all.”   (v. 2) I must admit, I’m scared  To see her there, the one I’ll love more  To make my heart, my feelings bared.  “This is who you’ve waited for.”  But what I fear more than this  That when I see her, even so,  I will not see her, who she is.  “My child, you will know.”   This was an actual dream I had. A vision of the future? a promise from God? I don't know.  Written 12/18/03
