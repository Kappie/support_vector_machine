I made my way downstairs and opened the medicene cupboard. The smell almost made me puke, let alone the rising acid from my stomache. I went to the loo and nearly fainted because I think I sat down too fast lol, I felt so sick!    Getting the gory details of my morning sickness out of the way...    I woke up by the alarm at 7:25 and discovered that my stomache ache had been reduced to a lesser terrible pain, It was still pissing me off anyway. Digital Camera didn't arrive in the post yet, but it could still arrive today (fingers crossed). Walked to school a little slowly due to my stomache, ARGH!    I was greeted by about 6 flying ants on the table in Hulse's room, which I didn't notice were flying ants until I was shown loads more flying around the room like mad! I think they're really disgusting, but Becky was biffing them and chucking them in the bin lmao. The must have come from the dormant filing cabinets or something! Information Sytems was funny. Mrs. Checketts was asking the Sixth Form what biscuits they would like in an assembly they're having, and whether they would like tea, coffee or orange juice.    Just had Physics and I did absolutely nothing at all because, to be honest, doing coursework on my last day (hopefully) is just pointless isnt it. Chris drew some cool things in my leaving book and we sat chatting. Mr. Pooley's laptop crashed and displayed lots of glitch sytle boxes all over the screen which kinda looked like something off The Matrix. Break was boring - period. I'm now in French and we're just sitting in the computer room doing things that are anything else but French.
