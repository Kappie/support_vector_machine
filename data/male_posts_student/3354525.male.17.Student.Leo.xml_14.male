The concert was headlined by Rooney, a band that looked as though they had come straight out of the late sixties.   First up was  urlLink Ozma , a band out of Los Angeles, California. This was their first show ever in Canada, and though I was not overly excited to see them, they put on a good energetic show, playing many songs such as  Battlescars .   The Second set was the band who I had come to see, Straylight Run from New York. This was also their first show in Canada. The front man of Straylight Run John Nolan and the bass player Shaun Cooper are probably familiar to those who are into the band Taking Back Sunday. In May of 2003 the two left TBS because of artistic differences. John  Shaun recruited Will Noon from the late Breaking Pangaea, and John's sister Michelle Nolan, who did some back up vocals and piano work on the album  Tell All Your Friends . SR started their set off with the song  The Tension and the Terror , which can be downloaded free from  urlLink www.straylightrun.com . They continued with several new songs such as  Dignity and Money  and  Holding On . Finally to end their set they played the ever popular song  Existentialism on Prom Night  with John on keyboard and Michelle on guitar.  The headliner  urlLink Rooney , well known from their guest appearance on the teen soap The OC, hit the stage with the roar and screams of uncountable adolescent girls. They played many popular songs such as  Blue Side ,  Stay Away , and  Popstars . Their encore consisted of the hit songs  I'm Shakin  and  Sorry Sorry .  overall the night was quite enjoyable, minus the fact of missing our train stop, and ending up in oshawa. Ozma  SR put on an amazing show. Rooney did the same however I was a little set aback by how full of himself the lead singer was. In the end I give this concert an 8 out of 10 rating. I readily encourage you all to check out these bands, you will be very impressed.   Until next time, Good morning, good evening, and good night, signing off:  Ghostmanon3rd .
