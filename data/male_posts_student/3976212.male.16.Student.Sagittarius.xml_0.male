I guess at one point i'd be happy...but gettin up at 2pm everyday...doin nothin but sittin outside and chattin online---thats not cool! Sure, the weather is fantastic---and i'd hate to be stuck inside all day...but by the time i'm ready to go outside (after breakfast, shower, etc) guess what time it is? 3pm. The exact time when school is suppose to be dismissed. Thinking back (I was talking to dave about this)....The beggining of last year (school year) was great for the both of us. Half way through...it became HELL. My last day of school (haha i actually had 2, the last day at semi and the last day of the year at powell river learning centre) was just like any other day, the next morning I slept into 11am (when I was suppose to be dismissed) and called my Grandmother from my hotel room---I slept in cause my eye was hurting from a bike riding accident. She said she would pick me up. We went to have lunch. I left a couple days later (actually it's still quite blurry in my mind).
