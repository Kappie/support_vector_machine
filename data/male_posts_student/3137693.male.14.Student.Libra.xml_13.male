CJH is a big school, full of people that i dont know and probably never will. Its really dumb not to know anyone because you kinda of just stand there like a loser and watch everyone there thats been friends since 7th grade, but i guess i dont get that 'priviledge' because i got booted out of my school by the "system", but hey what can you do?        I dont know when people are finally going to realize that im sorry for what i did, yes! you read that right! Zack Shutt is sorry for what he did, and if you didnt already know that then shame on you. I dont know what they see in me that is so dangerous, i recently was ordered to get a psychological evaluation, no problem, i went through it and the psychatrist said "why are you here?!" I cant be crazy, but people just dont care.   And life goes on...
