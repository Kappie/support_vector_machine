I promise you, it does have a point.] Dear Mrs. Hoffman, In past years, school and report cards were something I brushed off without a care. As a student, I was the proverbial “slacker.” With goals set as low as mine were, I had no reason to try. I was a C average student. Then last summer I was diagnosed with ADD and medicated. While I thought ADD was generally an over-diagnosed, non-existent disorder, my medication worked wonders. Suddenly I became more active—I was finally motivated-- and managed to lose between sixty and eighty pounds. I was feeling better about myself and finally developed some ambition. I promised myself that the next school year would be my best so far. I would push myself harder, and do my work with pride, never settling for eighty-five percent less than my best work. This new attitude paid off; as I boosted my grade about ten points and discovered my passion for learning. What, then, could be troubling me about my grades if I seem to have improved so well? I am writing you, as my guidance councilor, in regards to my unacceptably low grade of 82% (a C+). I do not believe I deserve a better grade; the fact of the matter is I DO deserve a better grade. I am never one to deny responsibility for my actions, the results of my actions, or my grades, but in this case I feel that Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s grading scheme is based on nothing but biases (and with reason to be, as bulleted below). The members of my second semester International Relations (IR) class were assigned a research project that would include a debate. For this project groups of two were formed and the class was instructed to research a topic and prepare for a debate. On the class before the debate we were to be assigned our positions (pro or con) on the debate, and have two days to prepare for the debate. While I understand the point of this exercise; to teach the students to look at both sides of an argument before they form an opinion on the topic, I feel that the point was missed, and greatly off target, as we could have been learning about international relations instead of debate and poor teacher organizational skills (we could have also been tested on our knowledge of the subject and gotten graded on that instead of assigned a project as a final, but that is just a matter of opinion and personal learning preferences, and I will not bother to bark up that tree). Most of the students in the class did not understand this objective so lots of bellyaching ensued. The topic I was assigned was “Can and Should Democracy Be Imposed on Other Nations?” I was assigned the position of Pro, as in “Democracy can and should…” This topic is a dead horse and need be beaten no more. Extensive research has led others and myself to believe that there is no intelligent, compassionate argument for the Pro side of this argument. If you are at all curious—In short: The reason that democracy, or any form of government or social behavior, cannot be imposed on another nation is because nothing can be successfully imposed anywhere, unless morality is completely disregarded, which in this day and age is impossible. As long as it is an imposition it cannot work. Everyone in the class, including Mrs. Griego-Boruch, and everyone I have asked since, have all agreed on this. I did the best I could on this project but midway through my debate I sabotaged my debate because I’m not a fool. The topic for the debate was, simply put, stupid, and not debatable. I expressed those sentiments to the class and everyone, including Mrs. Griego-Boruch, seemed to agree. I am a logical person, my integrity is valuable to me, and I was not going to deface myself in front of the class by ignoring the facts. I’m just not that kind of person, and I do not feel I should be graded on my character and my need to save-face in a situation a teacher forces me into. I received a 74% on that project… I’m curious as to what my partner got for this assignment. While this should have no effect on the outcome of this matter, I would just like to comment on the disgust I feel by the insincerity of Mrs. Griego-Boruch, who smilingly commended me on my ability to make strong points from such a hopeless side of a debate. She also complemented me on other aspects of my debate and made me think I was going to get a good grade. Below are a few reason why I believe the class was ineffectively instructed and reason enough to let most, if not all, of the students of that class pick the grades they think they deserve (I know that sounds crazy). •Not enough work was assigned to build a stable grade. We received (I believe) little more than two homework assignments—journal entries to be precise, and I’m not sure how a teacher can grade a journal entry, aside from grammar and conventions, because journals are strictly opinion, and opinion is not justifiably gradable. •Mrs. Griego-Boruch operated like an observer not a teacher. There was insufficient instruction time and if I were to have paid for this class directly out of my pocket instead of my taxes I would have asked for my money back. If we cannot grade her teaching style, it is unfair that she can grade our opinions. •It was not advertised as a debate class. Though IR may have been advertised as a class in which debates take place, I am most certain that it is not supposed to be a debate class. Grading based on debate performance and debate technique are unjustifiable (not to mention subjective. Debates can only be analyzed through opinion, and opinion should never, under any circumstances, affect a grade in any way whatsoever). I would like to see Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s grade book to solidify this notion of mine. •Am I alone in my thinking that a debate should not be gradable in a non-debate class? At least, the teacher must be able to teach effective debating before he/she grades the students on their utilization of debating techniques. That was definitely not the case in my IR class. • It’s been my observation that all of the students in the class (save a few) gave all the same effort, but I overheard Mrs. Griego-Boruch talking to Shivika Trivedi about her 112% for her third marking period grade. While it is true that Shivika did take on an extra responsibility for the class and deserved extra credit, I know that no extra credit should have brought her grade up that ridiculously high when other students putting in the same amount of effort got 80%s and 90%s. I believe it can only be reasoned that because Shivika and Mrs. Griego-Boruch were so “buddy-buddy,” which they were to an irritating extent, Shivika was graded on a much more lenient scale, or I should say, a much more realistic scale, as all the other students in the class deserved to be graded the same. This may not seem important, but from a students perspective this is madness. This is not third grade at St. Thomas, this is Senior High School at Garnet Valley. We are a blue ribbon school and that cannot be accepted. I can believe no other reason for someone receiving such a high grade with so little work to grade than simply being closer to the teacher than other students. (If you do not believe me, ask other students who were in classes with those two, they can attest to their unprofessional relationship.) •I believe class participation plays a substantial role in our grades in that class. I will say I did not participate as often as I possibly could, but every time I participated I had something of value that no one else was bringing to the issue, which cannot be said for half the students in the class. So, suppose all those times I did not raise my hand actually hurt my grade. Why then is my classmate, Adam Akl, listed on the GVHS website under the Distinguished Honor Roll list for the fourth marking period when he involved himself in the class no more than twice (and I’m just giving him a number as high as two just to be safe. I really do not think I saw his hand go up more than once in the entire semester we were in that class). His extreme lack of participation should have, according to Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s logic, plummeted his grade down to something like a 90%, assuming that he got 100% in every other aspect of the grading scheme. I could provide more information but I feel I’ve proved my point and for brevity’s sake I will try to end this letter. Let me end by just saying that with all the above information taken into consideration, and the fact that I gave just as much effort, if not more, effort than the next guy, I deserve a grade between an 85%-94% in my IR class, and I feel I’m being realistic about that. I will not settle for this menial grade of 82%. Unless Mrs. Griego-Boruch can approach this matter under the light of logical analysis in which I have so displayed and show me why I deserve the grade I was given, I will not accept this grade.  ------------{edited} PS- I would also like to meet with you to discuss my schedule for next year. I believe I am signed up for Psychology next year and I do not think this letter will have a positive effect on Mrs. Griego-Boruch’s opinion of me. Also, I am not sure if I am comfortable with Mrs. Griego-Boruch receiving a copy of this letter. As I have gathered from her character, I feel she is the kind of person who would defend herself to the end, no matter how wrong she knew she was. While that may sound like a personal attack, I am only thinking that it is in my best interest to give this situation no more attention and stress than it deserves. But if you feel it’s necessary to give her a copy of this, by all means, go ahead and give it to her.
