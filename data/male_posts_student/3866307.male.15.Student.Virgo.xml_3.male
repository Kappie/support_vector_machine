Not really used to typing out what i think for the world to see, but we'll see. So um yes.. for this first post i'll just copy some song lyrics of songs i've been listening a lot of lately.. All are by a band a good friend of mine lent me a cd to. They're called Copeland.. Check them out if you get a chance, or if you um know me well enough i guess, i'll copy a CD their cd of them for you.. good to listen to late at night when you're feeling low.. anyways, here's the lyrics..   Copeland: Beneath the Medicine Tree   Song: Brightest   If you find yourself here on my side of town,  I pray that you'd come to my door  and talk to me like you don't know what we ever fought about.  I don't remember anymore.  I just know that she warms my heart  and knows what all of my imperfections are.  She says that I am the brightest little firefly in her jar.    Song: Testing The Strong Ones   There's an angel by your hospital bed desparate to hear his name on your breath.  As he looks down you're not making a sound.  Open your eyes and look at me.  I'll bring to you whatever you need.  I'll tell you I'm sorry that I can't take this pain away from you.  I'd put it on my own body if I knew how to, can't you see?  I've got to bust you out of here somehow.  I've never seen your heart this tired I've never seen your spirit held down.  I know that you say, "this is what you get for being a bad child."  But I know this will be your reward in just a little while.  It's testing the strong ones.  It's scarring the beautiful ones.  It's holding the loved ones one last time.   Copeland-SecondStartotheLeft, Go Until Dawn   All this time away from you with you would be better all those days of summer fun missed you more than ever I sit still till high school whether but ponder still you know I never will stay silent it was a big mistake to let me had my way in the first place it was a big mistake to let me memorize your face I'm jealous of you moon tonight you get to see her alone beneath the stars and everything I fear all my strengthen was tranquilized and everyday I get weaker but stronger when I think of how we never sat silent it was a big mistake to let me had my way in the first place it was a big mistake to let me I memorize your face      Yes.. it was a big mistake to let me memorize your face  All for today..
