One of the more interesting problems with taking night shots is finding a stable location for the camera.  I can't hold it perfectly still with my hands -- I have to find a surface to put it on, but one that doesn't take away from the look of the picture.  The image above was taken on the trunk of my car: it was a very high-tech shot.      Sometimes it's nice to take the picture from the ground.  This shot was a little nerve wracking, because I had the camera out in the middle of the street.  I live on a fairly busy corner, and sometimes people come whipping around very fast.  Fortunately, both the camera and I survived.      Here's the first shot, except this time from the ground.  I like the illusion that you get with ground shots that the floor is somehow curved upwards at the edges.      This one is not really a great shot, but I love the fact that this is the view that I have out of my front door.  I don't live in a good neighborhood, but in some ways, it really pays to be in Miami...      And of course, the gratuitous "me" shot.  It's hard to look so serious for so long, believe me.   Do you believe they wanted $1,200 for a single bedroom in this place?  It's mind-boggling!  This is  not  a great neighborhood.  How can they think they're going to get away with it?  Bastards.  I guess they did get away with it.  I've got to go -- apparently, in order to go to Greece, I've got to give my passport number to the travel agent.  This is very exciting... I'm leaving on August 10th, and returning on the 20th.
