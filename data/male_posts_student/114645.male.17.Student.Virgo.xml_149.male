That's how I feel right now. I feel like I could just scream. I feel so alone. I don't know why either. It is frustrating sometimes. Know what I mean?  Now onto my day: Today was quite boring and depressing. I woke up about 10:15. Cleaning the garage yesterday took more out of me then I thought. Wow! So then my mom asks me if I want to go to the mall with her, and I said sure, so I got in the shower. Then we head off to the mall. My mom took her suit I got her for Christmas back. It didn't fit. Damn! But I was close. She said she will go back. The lady at Macy's was a bitch. She was rude when she found out we didn't have our tag from the suit. Not that we needed it, since we had the dress. What is it? Sales people are rude to customer week?  Then we went to Mervyn's so my mom could find shoes. She found some cool ones on sale for $25. That is always good.  Then we went to the Big Inning to watch the Broncos - Colts game. Damn did the Broncos suck. They lost, big time. And Neal was playing like a damn Raider. Oh well, baseball starts soon. Baseball starts in 7 weeks. Well pitchers and catchers report then. I can't wait till Spring Training.  I'm losing my bet to Tiffany. My bet: The Avalanche will have a better season then the Redwings. The Redwings are 4 games ahead of the Avalanche. But it is a long season.  God, I can't wait to go back to school. I'm so bored, and I miss seeing Trystin.  This is how I feel about Ryan:  . Oh well, maybe he will come around. I'm tired, and the Simpson's are on, so I will write more tomorrow.
