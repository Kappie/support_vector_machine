    
       through my tears  it is done.  i give up.  it is over.  i surrender.  my last breath of hope is gone and i have nothing left to hold on to.  my grip slips and i fall...back into the darkness of my pain...to the cruel world i know all too well...where there is no relief...where there is no mercy...and where there is no one to hear my cries...where i am alone once more.  i go quietly.  i dont fight.  i dont scream.  my tears fall silently...and all of this i accept...all of this i endure without fear.  for love sustains me...love lets me move on...and love lets me live each day.  and every night as i go to sleep at least ill know that i loved enough to let go...and ill find peace knowing she'll be happier.  and at least ill still be able to see her smile through all of my tears...   _______________________________________________________  This is my journal.  Most of this has to deal with my anxiety or the pain caused by my stress.  If you're reading this please dont feel sorry for me.  I dont want your sympathy.  I just want to be understood and i thank you for caring enough to read.  9/18/03 	Today was kinda weird.  I was content...sorta...i still miss kari...and getting to be around her.  i dont like the fact that seth and kari are close.  i hate not getting to be close to her...we hardly ever talk anymore...she seems to have moved on.  i kinda screwed up our friendship.  i kept on bringin up how i missed her and all...and i really do...but i dont think she understands that...she never loved me...not like i loved her.  love never dies and what she felt for me died...it was never love.  that hurts but i guess there really is nothin i can do to change that.  she seems so happy around seth now...and i guess that helps me...cuz now she can be happy...and that makes me happy. 	i've kinda moved on.  im talkin to mallory.  she's an awesome person.  she's not like anyone i've ever met.  her outlook on life just makes me cry.  its like someone i've been lookin for all my life...she doesnt worry bout anything...she can always find somethin good in everything that goes bad.  she makes me smile.  she makes me just think bout stuff totally differently.  i wanna say i love her...and i do in a way...maybe not as a girlfriend just yet... but there is hope and that helps me.  its kinda weird for me...i mean i really dont need someone to be happy but my gosh it makes things so much easier if i do have someone.  and mallory seems to be that person...its kinda weird...i still have feelings for kari but in a way i think that mallory would be better.   	i think the major problem for me is that i dont want a girlfriend like everyone else wants.  i have many friends...and all of them care for me...they all care about me and love me...but there is a problem...i guess its not a real problem...just a personal problem for me.  all my friends are here for me...usually...but then they get boyfriends or girlfriends and i suddenly become second.  i cant help that and i dont blame people for that...they are only human...but it hurts and its happened to me alot.  like all the sudden people dont have time for me.  thats why i want my girlfriend to be my bestfriend...cuz then i know that my friend will never not have time for me.  she'll always be there when i need her.  thats what i want from her...thats all i'd ask...and i'd give her whatever she'd want from me...i gave kari my heart and i think that i might be able to give that to someone else since she didnt want it.   	so now its mallory...she's great...wonderful person.  i was worrying about her today...i was worried bout what i should do bout our relationship.  we both know that we're interested in eachother...and she's wise to tell me that we should wait.  and i was also worried that now that she's starting to get scared of me.  cuz like i tell her bout how i am and how i worry bout stuff...and about my chest pain...and i was afraid she would just not like me anymore cuz im so messed up.  but she said that it was all ok and that she still likes me and that she thinks i should take more time to get over kari and work on my problems.  but she said she'd wait for me and that she'd be here...and my gosh that makes me feel so good that someone would wait for me...that she cares enough to wait.  makes me feel great.  cuz im wanted and somebody cares.   	well gosh this is long...and its only the first day...this is gonna be huge in like a month!  hehehe!  yanno now that i think bout it this is kinda nice...i get to just write everything down and its nice to let out...of course you cant talk back...but thats ok at least you're reading...well thats bout it for tonight...im tired and talkin to L...probably goin to bed soon...ttyl bye!  9/19/03 	today was ok again...nothin great happened...mallory was kinda quiet today...dunno why...she's really sweet when she talks to me but then she's like mallory when we're around everyone else...she likes to joke around...its great...i need the time to let out some stress.   	i kinda realized today that i do still love kari...i really miss her bad.  she doesnt talk to me anymore really...she's hurt or somethin and that just really bothers me.  she's so happy with seth now...she's always so happy and smiling around him...i dunno if maybe she just doesnt want him to see her upset...she always seems to be upset or somethin around me...or she's just not happy...i hate not being able to make her happy anymore...it stinks so bad.  and its still hurts to see seth flirt with her...she doesnt see it but he is...im a guy i so understand.  she just thinks he's bein a good friend but it so obvious that he likes her that its not even funny.  i feel so sick...makes me feel like crap that she doesnt love me anymore...well she never did like i said yesterday but yanno what i mean.   	i just dont get it and she cant give me an answer.  WHY NOT ME?  WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?  HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME AND YET TELL ME YOU DONT WANT TO BE MY GF?  DONT YOU MISS ME?  DO YOU HURT LIKE I DO?    she has no answer for me and i just dont understand.  i just hurts so bad.  my gosh i love her so much and yet i know i will never have her.  im trapped in a cage where im gonna have to spend the rest of my life knowing that she doest love me and that i will never be able to have her...and ill have to watch as other guys get to be close to her when i cant...and i will feel alone...not that thats new to me but its not a feeling i want to go back to feeling...which again leads to more pain.   	i guess i have some bittersweet happiness...cuz at least she'll be happy and i know that i loved her mor than anyone else could....i dont think she saw that but thats ok cuz at least she'll smile again...at least i loved her enough to let her go so that she could be happy...thats what true love is...being able to let go.  but its hard to truely be happy without her...cuz she could make all my pain go away and for once in my life i could feel happiness without the pain still raging...i dunno if you could understand what its like...for it to never go away and never give you a moment of peace...no relief...nothin...just always there...and then you meet someone that lets you feel somethin that you've never felt before...somethin you take for granted cuz you can feel it whenever you want...you can be happy...you can truely be happy...you dont have to laugh while still feeling pain...you dont have to smile when inside you feel like someone is ripping your heart out.  and i finally was able to experience that with kari...she showed me happiness...and for once i could smile and be happy.  and now that its gone and that im back to the way i dunno what to do...i want to feel that again...i want to be happy.  i wrote this bout 2 weeks when ellen and i were talkin and she thought that it was stupid cuz i couldnt be happy without someone...i wrote this to put it into perspective for her...  am i stupid cuz i want someone to cry to? am i desperate cuz i want someone to hold me when i dont think i can go on? do you think im silly cuz i want to be loved? do you think so?  you try living like me for a day...you try to live with my pain...every minute of everyday...you try to find comfort...you wont find it...you wont be able to feel peace or happiness...nothing...and no one will be able to understand you...you will be alone...and you will have no one to turn to...then after all of this you tell me if you still think im silly for wanting some comfort...  	kinda depressing...but its the truth...and i dont want to complain...i dont want you to feel sorry for me...i want people to understand that all those stupid things that you worry bout...all that stress you feel...just remember it could be worse...i know it could be worse for me...i dunno how much worse but i bet i could be...i really dont think people have an idea of what stress is like...i always laugh when people say "oh im so stressed" and yes maybe they are...but they dont know what stress is...you never understand what stress is until it starts to affect you physically and it wont go away...that is stress...stress that stresses you...that is what real stress is...what you feel is more worrying...its not stress...and i envy you...i wish i could be like that...like only gettin stressed sometimes...i wish i was normal...that would satisfy me...i wouldnt mind only have a little stress instead of stress 24/7.  yeah well im ramblin now...goin to the MA homecoming game with amy  aaron later...ill be back tonight to probably write some more...till then...au revoir!  after the game...same day... 	just got back from the Madison Academy homecoming game...lots of fun...lots of screaming!  i saw brandon, haley, kate, nadia, katie goode, katelin passon...and a ton of others!  it was alot of fun...a nice kinda.   	but now im back home and all the stuff is back...all that junk that is called my life...im talkin to mallory...and kari at the same time...kinda weird...the 2 girls i love...once that rejected me and hurt me and then the one that makes me feel like ill be ok and that ill get to keep goin on...i really want her to be mine right now...i dunno if i want that cuz i want just someone...it kinda feels right though...she's like the EXACT person i'd need...she could so help me with all my problems...but she dont wanna be like a fallback girlfriend...and i so understand cuz i wouldnt want to do that to her anyways...she doesnt deserve that...she's too great of a person to probably even deserve to be with me...im just a person full of trouble and problems... 	im really confused bout now bout my feelings!  i dunno what to do!  i still love kari..i still will forever...even if its in the deepest depths of my heart i will still love her always...but ill never have anything in return for that love so i gotta move on...and i want to move on to mallory and i know i could love her too...maybe even more than i ever loved kari even though i dont think thats possible but ya never know...but i dunno if im ready just yet for anyone new...but then i want someone new...someone to keep my mind off of kari...but i dont wanna just do somethin without thinking cuz if i do that then ill hurt someone...ill go out with someone and then realize i dont really like them and then ill just hurt someone...just like kari hurt me...and no one deserves that...even though it happens all the time i guess.  but still i dunno what to do... 	wow!  its 10:51...tiz very late...i should go to bed...but all i'd do is think some more and i kinda like writin it all down.  jennifer love hewitt is a cool singer...she's pretty good...sorry just thought i'd throw that in there.  yeah well im going to bed...if it's late when you're reading this then you need to go to bed too!  lol!  bye bye!  9/20/03 	saturday...its been an ok day so far...nothin too terrible has happened.  im goin to Madison Academy's homecoming party tonight with amy...i need to go change for that in a little bit for that...im supposed to look nice...dont really wanna go but hey i thought i'd be nice since amy's been so nice to me.   	i went to bed happy last night...mallory said she really was starting to like me more...WHICH IS TOTALLY AWESOME!  im pretty happy bout that...im starting to like her more too...even if its not as much as i like kari still...but kari has nothin more to give me so i need to move on to someone who does.  so im ok with this i guess...im still tryin to tell myself to forget kari cuz she'll never be there again...but my heart doesnt want to...this is so very hard...i know im in love...cuz even now...5 weeks later im still not ok...i still want kari so bad...and its not fair that i cant have her.  of course she might not be "the one".  would the one cause you this much pain?  what do you do when the only person who can stop your crying is the one who made you cry?   	pain hasnt been too bad today...mallory has helped that i guess...OH YEAH!  MADISON ACADEMY WON THEIR GAME 14 TO 6!  sorry i forgot to tell ya last night...hehehe!  oh yeah back to pain...not too noticeable...more of a sore feeling again.  i do feel very BLAH now.  i just want to not do anything...i just want everything to go away...I NEED A BREAK!  i want to like not go to school and dont wanna go and do anything...unless its with mallory...then i wouldnt mind...but EVERYTHING else needs to just go away!  of course i do have my senior high retreat in 5 days....that will be lots of fun....that's probably gonna be the only break ill be getting...and even that probably wont be a break from the pain...but hey i cant always get what i want so im not gonna complain.  I DONT WANNA GO TO THIS PARTY!  IM TOO TIRED! AND I WANT A BREAK!  ok there i said it!  lol...i wasnt gonna type that but then i thought hey this is MY journal ill type whatever i want to!  ok well...im goin to go change into some "nice" cloths for this party thing...ill be back later tonight...till then adios!  after the homecoming party...same day... 	back from the party...kinda boring...but hey i got to get out so it was fun.  hehehe.  talkin to mallory again.  i dont wanna go to bed...i've kinda wasted away my weekend but hey it was fun so im good...i kinda dont know what to say.  i was talkin bout my break up with kari...amy and i were talkin and she said that kari told katie goode a different story than what i told amy.  i really dont like that its been botherin me...i want to know what kari tells people so that im not tellin a different story cuz i dont wanna be that type of guy where kari's friends look at me and say "oh there goes kris...that jerk that hurt kari".  i want to be remembered as the guy that fell in love with kari but that was just not loved in return.  i dont our breakup to be anyones fault.  i want people to just know that it wasnt harsh or mean.  she just didnt love me and so it ended.  nothin mean or anything.  cept i kinda didnt let it happen that easily.  i fought for a little bit.  i didnt want to give up...in a way i still havent given up and i still do have hope.  but there isnt much there.  i did hurt her...and i feel so bad bout that...it was cuz i didnt let go so easy.  i wouldnt give up and eventually hurt our friendship.  so now i feel bad bout that.  i guess i cant help that now.  i've got to move on.  oui.  well i think im gonna go to bed now.  its 10:56.  late again.  night.  9/21/03 	well today is the day that i can legally get my license....but its a sunday so they're closed...ill just have to wait till another day...not like i have anywhere to go or anyone to go with or anything to go in.  hehehe!  im goin to the Junior High Devo tonight at L's house.  its gonna be fun!  L's the bomb!  and so is bay bay!  im not supposed to be goin cuz im in the senior high...but hey who would dare stop me!  im all powerful! MUHAHAHAHA!  ok fine!  geez...let me have my moment without think im an idiot!  hehehe!  yanno i wonder whose gonna read all of this!  they're gonn be like man he's really messed up.  aww well!  you just have to get over it!  lol!   	hmmmm...not what has been botherin me today.  i havent gotten to talk to mallory today.   she hasnt been online all day.  YANNO IT IS SO HARD TO STOP LOVING SOMEONE!  i still dont wanna let go of kari...at least a part of me doesnt want to.  but i really like mallory.  sometimes i wish i could just forget bout kari and just move on.  but its SOOOOOOO hard!  i mean for cryin out loud im in love with her!  i hate to admit it but i still am!  and i dont know how to stop!  am i supposed to?  it just doesnt seem right...but she doesnt love me!  i with there was a book on how to handle this.  like that told me "if you love someone and she dont love you, then you...."  and whatever!  wouldnt life jsut be great if we had a book on how to handle everything!  that'd be awesome!  i mean the bible is cool...its got everything i NEED to know to live....but like it doesnt have some of the stuff i'd like to have.  i guess thats where friends come into the picture.  L's nice...she kinda reminds me when to turn to God when im just too like stressed out to remember to do that...she's like my best Christian friend.  she's awesome!  i love her to death!  she helps me soo much!  of course she's also one of those girls that would never consider me as a bf cuz we're such good friends!  i've asked TWICE!  and she's said no both times.  i guess thats ok...i really am content with what she is to me....i like it how it is.  there are other girls.  there was kari...but now there's mallory.   	i kinda wonder if mallory's got a sweet side.  i havent really seen to much of that.  not sayin that she isnt nice cuz she really is.  but yanno i like girls who can be real sweet to me.  not that i wouldnt go out with a girl who wasnt...i mean i wanted to go out with L!  hehehe!  not too much sweetness there!  mallory has been pretty sweet to me...maybe not as sweet as i'd like...but hey i might as well see what she's really like....i guess ill find out over time.  sweetness isnt exactly a priority for me...its more just will she love me back.   that'd be sweet enough for me!  hehehe!  well im bout tired out of writing for now.  ill probably be back after the devo....MISS ME!  9/23/03 	well i didnt write yesterday...was i monday?  i guess so...yeah it was...wow its only tuesday...thats crazy!  i thought it would be like wednesday already.  gosh...i want this week to go by quicker!  IM READY FOR MY RETREAT!  of course L wont be there and thats not gonna be cool at all....L is so awesome!  i love her to death...she's like the person i go to when i need to just like get away from everyone else...just like free time... 	well mallory are like this >  after piano lessons...same day....  i still hurt....and there is still no relief...i still cry....and still no one hears...and i am still silent...still bearing what i must...still wondering why...still wondering what is to become of me...i hide among the crouds...so not to reveal my pain...i hide behind a wall to hide the cold scared confused boy...who knows not what to do...where do i turn?  who will come and tear down that wall?  who cares enough to notice?  who cares enough to hold me?  who will love me?  	wrote that a couple days ago...i was really kinda feelin it again...that missin kari thing...it came back full force.  well i put it in my profile...which i usually do...and mallory read it and she said she'd love me...it was the sweetest thing...almost made me cry...she's so sweet!  i love her to death!  she really does make me feel good.   	chest hasnt been hurting too much since i found out that mal likes me.  maybe that just gives me comfort...to know that someone loves you...even though yanno they dont have to...its like a choice they make.  not like a parent or sibling which kinda "have" to love you...but some stranger who decides to love you...that makes me feel special...and i love that feeling and it kinda hides my pain...its wonderful to be able to truely feel happiness.  ok well im happy so im gonna stop writing...so i dont accidently stir up old feelings...cya tomorrow...  9/24/03 	well its wednesday.  2 days till the senior high retreat!  im so ready to go!  i kinda wanted to go to the big spring jam but hey i'd really rather go to the retreat...it would benefit me more.  well...kari asked me today why i dont like talk to her at school.  and i told her the truth...it just hurts to talk to her...it just so many good memories...it brings back all the memories that i miss...and the makes me think bout that stuff that im not gonna be able to experience with her.  and i dont wanna think bout that now.  cuz i really want mallory now and i think she'll really care for me and i really hope she'll love me back.  i would love that right now.  specially from her.  yeah. well its late and i dont feel like writing any more.  9/25/03 	SENIOR HIGH RETREAT TOMORROW!  woohoo!  i cant wait!  im so ready to go!  oh yeah!  go kris!  gettin out of here!  i had my choir concert today...i thought it was ok...most people thought it was great and it was...we were very good.  chest pain hasnt been to bad this week...i guess thats been good...im still just so emotionally just AHHH!  this is journal thing is starting to get short again.  i guess im not thinkin too much bout my pain so im not complaining about it...its so much easier just to ignore it.  yes...again im leaving...im too busy talkin to mallory to write!  so cya MONDAY!  ill be gone ALL WEEKEND!  10/4/03 	well its been a LONG time since i've written in this.  alot has happened.  senior high retreat was fun.  i wish ellen had gone it would have been alot more fun with her.  she's my closest true friend.  she's so awesome!  its too bad i cant take a piece of her and just stick in here.   aww well.  leavin tomorrow for california.  goin to see Grandpa probably for the last time.  he's supposed to die in bout 2 months.  i dont seem sad do i?  i dont feel sadness.  i dunno why.  i want to say that i find comfort in knowing that he'll be in a better place...but i cant cuz he's not saved.  i think its just me.  i dont feel much anymore.  all i can feel is my pain and anxiety which focuses around my relationships and around my pain too.  i dunno if somethin's wrong with me. maybe im just too depressed and strained right now.  i just dont feel sad.  maybe i dont realize what is happening.  or maybe i just dont wanna accept it.  i dunno.  i think im just so past emotions right now.  im so sick of them.  arent emotions an amazing thing?  they can take you to highest peak and then can drag you to the darkest depths.  lol.  you can tell i've had a lot of time to think bout all of this.  i like to analyze feelings.  probably why i wanna be a psychologist.  feelings are the coolest things.  and the most terrible things too.   	mallory and i are goin out now.  yep we sho are!  it was so funny.  we like to play the question game and all.  of course i tend to ask most of the questions but hey thats ok.  well the other night i asked her to ask me a question.  she asked one.  and i said yes.  LOL!  thats right!  she asked me out!  she took my job away!  lol!  it was pretty cool.  yes well now the hard part comes.  im still so in love with kari.  this is the biggest dilemma i've ever had. i love kari so much but she doesnt love me and probably never will (not that i dont have hope) and then i have mallory who is so loyal to me and likes me alot.  but it is so hard to have feelings for her.  it doesnt feel right...kari and i feel right.  my gosh i miss her so much.  but i miss mal too!  i like her and really i think she's the person i like the most after kari.  this is so hard!  what am i supposed to do?  stop following what my heart tells me is right and follow what makes logical sense?  is love logical?  why must it be so unpredictable?  why cant love work when i need it to?  why cant i be loved by the one i love?  i really hope you never have to experience this.  its not fun at all.  it hurts so bad.  especially if you're like me. 	i had an epiphany the other day.  i think thats how you spell it.  i realized after 2 whole yrs that ALL of my anxiety and pain revolves around 2 fears.  the fear of rejection and the fear of being alone.  that is the root of everything.  i finally figured it out.  i dunno if it makes me feel any better but at least i know why i feel this way now.  but it just makes sense.  this really all started at the end of school in 8th grade when Courtney, Vickie, Aaron, and Trey and their group (which included me at the time) started to get closer.  and i was slowly pushed out.  i felt rejected then.  and scared taht i was losing a friendship.  all that built up and i threw up on the 2nd to the last day of school from all the stress.  then in 9th grade in our first semester kari and maria were like bestfriends so they were always hangin out and trey and kari were gettin close for reasons that i cant tell you...and i just felt left out and rejected again.  and thats when i went into a depression and stopped eating and just got really low.  and of course all the "little" incidents all revolve around my fears.  but then there is the worse rejection.  the one from kari.  my gosh that was and is the worst.  cuz not only was i rejected by someone i had given my heart to but i was also left alone.  with no one.  and i sunk.  really low.  and i got really depressed.  it was bad.  worse than anyone could have thought.  kristopher.  the good christian boy.  the boy who is always so happy.  who loves bein around peopel and jokin around.  nobody ever sees the real kristopher.  the cold scared boy who hides behind his wall as he cries.  nobody sees or hears him.  one because he hides it and 2 cuz they dont wanna think that someone around them is unhappy cuz then they get upset.  kari doesnt even know how low i got...i probably couldnt tell her anyways.  i dont want her to feel guilty.  its not really her fault...she caused it but its not her fault.  and now you're askin how low i got?  you really wanna know?  you might regret that...did you know that there are 18 knives in my house?  18.  did you know that at around 10:00 everyone but me goes to bed and im alone?  can you figure out how low i was?  i had it all planned out.  im not gonna make  you listen to that.  you probably dont want to.  but i was really close.  have you ever thought bout that?  well probably not...most people dont get that low...i wish i were like them...oh i would give so much just for a day like them.  but no have you thought...isnt it amazing how such a simple device, a blade, can take everything away.  a blade could make my pain go away and my stress just disappear.  isnt it funny how people cant help themselves but simple little things can help them.  somethin so simple could stop such a complicated problem.  man i was close.  so close.  but then i thought...if i go then what bout the people that depend on me?  what bout mallory?  she loves me...why should i put her through that pain.  or ellen...what would she think...she'd be disappointed in me.  or davida?  she doesnt deserve to be put through that.  or kari?  she doesnt deserve to feel that either or to feel guilty.  and someday she might need me...and i wouldnt be there for her.  or my family?  that would be so terrible for them.  and Jesus?  he would be so disappointed that i couldnt have faith enough to keep going.  and i couldnt kill myself because of Him.  He died for me...He gave me a gift and i would be throughing it back in his face.  i could not bring myself to do that.   	but now i have to say to all of those out there that are suicidal.  if you are reading this listen to me.  this world is cruel and terrible place.  it shows no mercy to you or anyone else.  and it will never let you rest.  but think...if everyone in the world killed themselves when they got down what would the world be like?  it would be whole lot worse.  it would be hell.  you and i...we are important in this world.  all those people i mentioned above depend on me.  they depend on me to be happy at least somewhat.  they would be really sad if i killed myself.  i carry some of their pain.  they will never experience it for i am the one who does but in a way it is their  pain.  you see people who are suicidal...they are the people that carry the most pain in this world.  they are the ones who bear what others cant.  they bear the pain of the world.  but if you are one of those people dont lose hope.  dont feel alone.  dont feel cheated out of life.  there is hope.  and there is a way to feel what others are blessed enough to feel everyday.  you can be happy.  just have faith in God.  He will never leave you.  You will never be alone with him by your side.  He will ALWAYS be there.  and with Him you can live a life like everyone else and even a better life than most.  cuz what can this world do to you if you have God on your side?  and remember this verse...it is the my favorite verse in the Bible and it helps me live each day.   "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest." -Matthew 11:28
