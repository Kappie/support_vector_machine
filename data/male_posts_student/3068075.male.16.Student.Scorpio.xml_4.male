You wouldn't realise how difficulst it is to do things you always took for granted, when you have a money spider on your arm. For instance it's a pain typing right now, as I have to make sure he (or she) remains on top of my arm - i dont want him (or her) falling off. Umm, fuck, I just tried to nudge it a bit and I, um, squashed it.  Sorry.  But maybe money spiders aren't so lucky after all, eh?
