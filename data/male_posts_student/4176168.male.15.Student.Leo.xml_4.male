I want to get my passport today, so we can have over trip at the US, we're thinking of going to NY for a couple of days...4 to be exact, we're going to drive over (which I think will be a lot of fun) and stay there and visit a few places and have some fun. I think it'll be great.  A lot of anime for me today, Chobits, Samuria 7, Naruto...fun fun fun, love these animes...only if the download times are not so huge -_-...but I got a new Bit Torrent client, and it seems to be faster, so we'll see. :D  A couple days ago, one of my house phones decide to break on me, today, I finally got around to fix it but the service fee is crazy!...just for the tech people to simply look at it, it will be $30, and than they'll give you a "complet" bill after they finish fixing it...I really don't have that much money to fix a simple cordless  phone, so I guess I'll find somewhere else to fix it. How troublesome...  My friend have been working on a new lay-out for Naruto Spot, and I can say it is looking good!...it'll be up in a couple of days, so go and check it out!  The chinese's have already won 10 gold in the olympic game, the have more than any other country!...this really is coming as a surprise for me, I never realized that the chinese were strong at these games, but I'm very proud of the team and hope they keep it up. :D  Later Days  "Pollution will be recognized as a serious problem when it interferes with TV reception" - Hugh Arscott  Neo...
