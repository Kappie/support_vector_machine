I think it'd be more time efficient if I figure out what video places have  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes  and make it an along the way type thing.  I watched  Monsters Inc.  today. It was a very enjoyable movie. It kind of reminded me of  Little Monsters  with Fred Savage though... only  Little Monsters  didn't have cameos by Woody and Nemo.  I got 2 pages written today! 2 pages plus a whole lot of editting and rearranging of my paper. I spent a good couple of hours today on my  Planet of the Apes  paper. I'm so proud of myself!  Art History 550E: 10/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 16/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 9/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 47 / 65 = 72.3%  Remaining: 18 pages / approx. 13 days = 1.38 per day   Ok now... I forsee beer in my future.  This has been a very nice day on so many levels.  ****
