I was a little upset about the King's Island thing, how it seems like you guys are intentionally setting up for a confrontation.  I think you guys care about the group more than I thought - you just want to make some changes, and that's fair.  So, let's just try to do it in a peaceful way. Also, thank you all so much for coming to PseudoMOM.  If you enjoyed watching it half as much as we enjoyed putting it on, than we enjoyed it twice as much as you. In conclusion, I love you all. (But in a totally nonsexual way)  (Except for Sophia) (No, just kidding) (Mostly)   The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.
