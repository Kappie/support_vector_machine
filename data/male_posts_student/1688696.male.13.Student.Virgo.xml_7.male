She's kind of ignoring me. Like I'll be asking her something and I'll get no answer. Anyway this is about Retro Nintendo, so I'll get to that now.  Ok, as you might have read earlier, I got a new bookshelf thing. Well my mom and dad did. So I had to help them move it to the upstairs, where an old cabinet thinger was. Well I had been looking for the rest of the old Nintendo games for almost a year. I pulled the drawers open. I found the games! And I got really happy and such. So I played a few. I'll list all the games.  Punch-Out! TigerHeli Kung-Fu Baseball SuperMario 1,2,3 Giromite Duck Hunt RaceCar! TopGun er.. I don't remember any more....  Anyways so yeah I found the games and I'm not really..but still kind of being ignored by Alyssa on the phone so, I'll write again tomorrow..Later
