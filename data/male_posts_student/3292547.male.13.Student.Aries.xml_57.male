I meant to tell you about it last night, but it's better telling you now.  It came in a series of 3. The 1st-   urlLink The Golden Compass  ; The 2nd-   urlLink The Subtle Knife   ;and then the 3rd-   urlLink The Amber Spy Glass  . All 3 books of course are written by Philip Pullman. So far it's a really good series, but I've yet to find a book quite like   urlLink The Mark of the Horselord  . I think that's the best book I've ever read.   Those are links to the Amazon.com page for each book. If the link is not working, you can search for them there.
