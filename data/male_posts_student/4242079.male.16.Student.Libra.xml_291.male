Purchase Number One   Purchase Number Two   Purchase Number Three   Plus there is Kylies Christmas Gift, which is still coming, put I won't put a link to it up until it is in her possession. Now, this list may look rather small, but I assure you, it is pointless. "Hell Is For Heroes" is a band which I have never heard, nor heard of. And the "Clockwork Orange Soundtrack"?. Sure, it's something I would listen to, but look again, it's a record. I do not own a record player. Ah well. A good way to pass the time, eBay is.
