Just after dinner an arguement breaks out about a bloody chocolate bar...a stupid fucking chocolate bar...i mean what the fuck! so now mum is out of her good mood, and dad is sour again - its silly...so i decided to retreat to my room with my good friends alcohol and films.  i think Jenny thinks i like her cos i said she;s pretty - which she is - but i think shes reading into it too much - so screw her...  i miss claire...i want her to come back soon...shes so sweet and lovely...  ooo seeing louise and big sister tomorrow to play some ppol - should be a laugh - apparently hannah used to be on The Grand Hotel pool team...bet shes crap :P  oh great now mum had just burt into my room and stated that shes not gonna do anything of me or my dad because were' "barstards" welll i feel bloody loved! i dunno why she does this - its rediculas, why cant we just be a happy family like everyone else i know? why do we all have to fight and squabble over nothing!? i dunno i just wanna get away go on holiday anywhere just dont wanna be here. i think i might go to uni just to get away from my folks - as much as i love them both they just pain me with their constant bickering and snide comments... no wonder i'm prone to stress if i have this at home and a mental kickin at school too.
