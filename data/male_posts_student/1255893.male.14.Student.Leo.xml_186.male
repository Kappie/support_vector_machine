I wish I had something to actually talk about...... but my head is just drained. Nothing is coming to mind as of late. I guess that's why it's been easier to focus in school. I actually finished my homework BEFORE 10pm last night! I guess that happened mainly because I didn't go online at all. Maybe that's what I should do for a while, just focus on my work for a while.
