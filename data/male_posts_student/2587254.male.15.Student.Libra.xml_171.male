For some reason I was sneezing a lot today, cept I held them in, so yeah my head felt like it was going to pop. So for the most part today I slept....but before that...  I woker up this morning at around 8am, and then quickly got ready for church. Had to bring towercase again since I was too lazy *and also didn't think of this* to put powerpoint on two floppy disks and then bring it to church. So instead I just unplugged everything and brought it to church. Jason didn't answer his door this morning when I went to give him a lift to church, which the story will be explained later. It's really very interesting how he didn't answer the door. Anyways got to church at about 830...  But for some reason only Gavin was there. So when I asked him where she was, he just shrugged and said "I don't know." So yeah...by 8:50 we had to call Carmen and tell her she's not doing worship this week. Wasn't the coolest thing to do, but she didn't show up and we had to practice, so we had to do what was done. So worship started around 915 as usual, and we didn't do too bad for just drums and guitar and Gavin on vocal.  I couldn't get full message of second coming today as I was running back and forth with a somewhat runny nose, but I got for the most part that He IS coming soon, but we should always be prepared, since God will not be coming on schedule, but by surprise. The Bible uses the analogy of a thief coming without notice. So yeah...be prepared haha. Carmen and Jason came a bit late but they still managed to make it. Mike got an I-Pod which is shweet...hmm yeah that's all I can really remember. Oh yeah and after service they pointed out that for the song "I can only imagine" I forgot to put in lyrics....OOOH SO THAT EXPLAINS WHY NO ONE WAS SINGING...Haha whoops =P.  So yeah going downstairs I asked Jason if he just slept in this morning. Apparently not...  He explained that when I went to ring on his doorbell...he thought today was Monday. Yeah I know sounds farfetch'd, but he pretty much thought "wth? Who would ring my doorbell at 830 on a Monday? Screw that I'm gonna sleep." A while later he then woke up and wondered why his mom wasn't at work. Then he finally turned on his TV and saw it was Sunday. That was when he thought "Uh Oh...CRAP!"  That was the story of Jason's morning. Carmen's I don't know. Like usual though she was poking me to death, with my defense of flailing arms almost working MUAHAHA! Anywho, me Calvin and Dan and Mike then went outside to throw around the football for a bit, and then Bible Study started.  Today we started studying Daniel. You know the story, how he got taken to Babylon, etc etc. Personally I didn't learn a lot today, but I did learn something new at least. I never really noticed the courage Daniel had to even request for a different food from the King. Normally you'd think people would take what the King has given, but he objected to the King to not go against his own morals.  So after lesson chilled for a bit, I learned power G chord on guitar and then I had to go home.  Lunch at home was alright....some celery dish w/ mushrooms and pork. Meh...and rice of course. So after lunch played some SC, but for some reason a killer headache was beginning to form, so I quickly stopped and headed upstairs for some sleep.  *four hours later*  Waking upt at 9, I then realize that the house is pretty quiet. Apparently dad went to sleep, and dinner was made a while back. So quickly ate, and from then until now I have been studying for biology. Argh so much stuff I still must cover. Anyways I'm out for now....gotta study for bio still haha.  Later.
