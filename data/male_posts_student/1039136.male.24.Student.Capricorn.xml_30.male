I THINK...now..its possible I won't feel this way on any given day..but I THINK that i'm about to put nearly all my focus into my body.  Now, don't get the wrong idea..I've been focused.   I've religously spent four days a week at the gym. On mondays and wednesdays,I weekly alternate between two different lifting programs customized for professional wrestlers and on Fridays and Sundays I run a few miles and then follow that with some concentration lifting.  I think though that its time to kind of shut out any emotions or activities that might fuck up my focus in the gym.  One thing i'm considering cutting down on even more, or even eliminating is drinking. Don't take that the wrong way..its not for a moral reason, a self control test, or anything of that sort, its purely physiological.  As you probably know, I LOVE drinking...its one of my favorite past times but lately I have cut down considerably.  Many factors have contributed to that. Among those are how shitty the ESU party scene has become, and possibly my age...But i think i'm just about willing to do whatever i need to in order to keep my body prepared to lift. Also coming up, I will be in the ring, working off the rust, honing my skills and working on some new moves and things..so really I dont think I will have much time available to feed the alcohol beast within.  I have several big projects to work on for school too, so i think pretty much..there won't be many drunken stories in here.   I'm sure there will be a few exceptions..ya gotta let loose sometime..but my #1 vice so to speak..is going to be the gym. Lately it has been good to hear that people notice my hard work.  A "brother" of mine, Phil, pointed out how my size has doubled since we've returned to school.  I guess thats a measure of accomplishment to me..when people notice and let me know.  Well lets see if i can keep this mindset... My luck i'll end up looking like an unmotivated jackass and end up partying like a fuckin star again this week..ahh..life..cant complain about it too much..its just great to be alive sometimes..and to be human. Other times..of course..it seems better to be a rock..or a piece of pizza.  Peace.
