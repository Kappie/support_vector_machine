So know the site is  urlLink crazyjoe.eu.kz  which is really good.  Short name, Amazing Results.   So know, getting into google.  Won't be that hard accuatlly because blogger was bought by google a while ago so they might already have me. I will go see.  No, not yet.  But, one of my other sites is on top with "crazyjoe blog"  So, in that case, I should submit this blog becuase I'm sure no one in the world has laid eyes upon this word - "sucks" , much less the rest of the site.  Do you people that don't come here want to post here? How about you email me, or write a comment, or sign my guestbook or something. Should get a counter.
