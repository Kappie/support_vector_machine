The concept is that Robert Evans, a powerful hollywood producer, is a secret agent for the government. So far he's attempted to assasinate Kim Jong Il, exposed an Nazi hiding as an infulential member of the Jewish hollywood community, and many other zany adventures. Anyone that has yet to see it should do so. i fervently support the above product and/or service.  Thanksgiving is tommorrow and that means two things: Shitloads of food and drunken grandparents. My dads family is very straight laced, so seeing them drunk is one of the greatest childhood memories I can think of. Seeing them try and hum with their wine glasses and tell the same dirty jokes ive heard a thousand times before is just something that warms my heart. My Grandma is a phenominal cook. Its ridiculous. The lithargical haze is both long lasting and highly enjoyable.      I need a chick sooooooooooooo................. bad.  But on that note, a friend of mine has been haveing troubles with his girl. I was listening to the songs I had downloaded a few days back and I stumbled upon one that I felt best described the situation.  You Wouldn't Believe Music: N. Hexum; Lyrics: N. Hexum, D. Martinez (I.E. 311)   He was a king 'til she laid waste Now he can not fill up the space And I just see him drifting while he's drifting On bourbon alley feeling low Just because she let him go I don't think he even knows He'll ever be fine  Refrain: And he's got  a head full of ideas Let me tell ya  That you wouldn't believe And he's got  a heart made of pure gold And something else Many tricks up his sleeve You might think he's a jester  because he'll make you laugh til' you cry  And what else You better come with your best  if you test him Unless you're ready to die  Wonder woman got rid of wonder man that man's not part of her wonder plan Letter to the so called better bet on my man Believe it you will find out baby Damn  Refrain  A million people come and go Through a person's ebb and flow And faces keep on changing While they're changing A certain few will stay in tact When they're not they'll don an act I know this important fact Don't get confused like  Refrain  First you love him then your loving him not All the while he just smiles giving all that he's got Do you find it in your heart to say he's not what you sought Do you want me to continue with this or what  Whoa yeah, whoa yeah Head full of ideas Let me tell ya  That you wouldn't believe And he's got  a heart made of pure gold And something else  so many tricks up his sleeve
