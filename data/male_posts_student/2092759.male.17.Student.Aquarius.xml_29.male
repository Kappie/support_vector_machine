My mommy went to the Hospital this morning to have Gall Stones removed. She'll be off her feet for about two weeks, so the family gets to run around and wait on her hand and foot. That should be fun. Im 0-3 as far as prom dates are concerned. People have been trying to tell me to go stag and ive go to tell yea.... Prom just seems so couple oriented that going Stag just seems so anti-climactic and meaningless that ive kind of ruled that out as even a remote posibility in my mind. O well. Im going to talk to Liane for a little bit more and then go to bed.
