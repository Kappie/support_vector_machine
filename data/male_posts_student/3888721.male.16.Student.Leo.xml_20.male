The zhong dian is on tomorrow, GCE O'level English oral examination. 10 years...preparing 10 long years for this exam, so I hope i won't screw up tomorrow. I couldn't sleep last night, keep on thinking what's gonna come out for the exams, so can predict that i will be having lesser sleep tonight. I'm feeling that damn pathetic now, and therefore, I'm going to force the study mood to come about, force it like i never force it before, and with everything i am. Now no time to write a long long blog for you readers to enjoy, so sorry about that. Zhong dian for tomorrow...DON'T SCREW UP!!!
