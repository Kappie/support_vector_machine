Shame on me for not advertising it here. I have learnt that I have a problem on stage. It's not am external deficiency. I project well and have presence. What I do not do is trust the script. On the last night of production, I was told (indirectly) that I needed to be a responsible actor as well as trust the line enough to bring out it's truth. Whatever that means. It sounds like something a hippie would say when they tell you in a drunk cum enlightened cum speech impeded tone "make love not war", or "peace dude". It makes sense though coz it comes from Mrs. C. She's the boss. I will try to do better next time by maintaining the "stability" of the play and not letting it spin into a "vortex". I have to admit, it does sound like something that someone who doesn't know what he's talking about would say. But Mrs C knows a hell lot more than I do and there's no question of pride when it comes to her coz she's the boss.  Leon and I thought about why the second night's audience was so unresponsive. We figured it was the introduction, which was more of an offensive challenge rather than a modest invitation. We figured it was the temperature and stuffiness of the place. We figured that it was the beautiful five-for-fighting song that was cut abruptly before it ended. Well actually, I figured these out. Leon wouldn't say things like these. He's too politically correct. He's wise because he watches what he says.  We were at NYDC and I was penniless. Hence, I resorted to palm-fulls of cheese sprinkles meant for pizza. The man at the table next to ours gave me a strange look, which I managed to observe via the marvels of peripheral vision. I did not talk to Jolyn. It bugs me less now. Just like Dawn. Loss is existent, but soon, you stick up for yourself. And when you do, the other party becomes wronger and wronger. The self-righteous call this trait, "pride".  Mummy and I have been fighting about me coming back late. She treats me like a child. I want to be treated like a precocious child. Still doted upon, but given ample freedom. I mean, I did call her to tell her where I was. What's more, the girls with me didn't have to do that. She does not know how lucky she is to have me as a son. I know plenty of people who wouldn't bother or wouldn't be required to tell their parents where they are. I know that it's not fare that she says "it's your business to go and eat, not socialize" on the last night of production. My mother is a liar. She's been one since I was a kid. She used to twist my words to suit her whim and all I could do was suffer injustice in silence. Well well well, can't really play that game with me now can she? I'm supposed to honouring my parents. Hence, to balance my words, I shall now say that it's because of her that we eat. Of course this comes with the price of not being around. But that's ok. It's not important to her anyway. I'm not very polite to her. I feel bad about that. I should be so polite that she'd be doing herself harm by twisting her words with me. I can play a card game without even having to hold cards.  Am still sure that there's an exclusive clique in drama and that I'm not appreciative of it. I don't like this concept and I'm sure beyond the shadow of a doubt that collective unity is always more fulfilling. Too bad that almost everyone there is a politician. I'm very sick today. It's a level 8 Zel. And politicians only serve to make matters worse.  The national drama competition preliminary rounds were today. I hold what some would call the anchoring role. I cried when the scene called for it, which would have amounted to about 5, or 6 times. I will do my best for the team. I was not certain of the emcee was male or female.  Homework pile up. I think I'll skip school tomorrow. For some reason, my tagboard's down. I have no idea why but my friend says that the same thing's happening to her, so I'm less worried now. Khin left yesterday. I miss her already. No matter, online friendships work too! Poor Leon, I'll be there for you bro. That's what I do. Tata's been discharged but he's still very weak and the doctors didn't tell us anyting about significant recovery.  I wanna go stay with Pati and Tata again.  Zel and I just had a big fight. It's all spoilt again. I dont know what I did to do this. It's not her I know coz of what happened but I don't understand God, why you're punishing me like this? I'm so distraught I feel like hurting myself all over again. I can now expect empty cries from associates, so don't bother writing me any. Oh God, I wish she'd call. I know she's hurting and I want to help her desperately but I dont know how!  Oh God, she did call. And now I feel worse. Fortune, thou art inconstant.
