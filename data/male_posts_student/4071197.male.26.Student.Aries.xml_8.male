In this process, clearly and effectively communicating is of great importance, as this smoothens the transition.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The trend in business today is for companies to push to recentralize their IT operations in order to reduce costs and achieve better economies of scale on technology purchases. Recentralization can be counted on to yeild savings on "infrastructure and other IT services that are driven by a large level of fixed costs." For example, companies that consolidate their data centers generally see a cost reduction of 10% to 15% in that area. the question now is whether those efforts are paying off, as companies try to boost their return on investments (ROI)  A major stumbling block to recentralization is to include effectively communicating the rationale for the process to all IT staffers and business users. Many may feel threatened by the new structure because they may feel as though the are losing control of their operations. However, if these users are properly informed, educated, and involved in the process the transition can be a much smoother one. Organizational change is nearly always a difficult and threatening process. It is importnant to help end users understand the value of IT.  Reference: Hoffman, T. (2002).
