OH YEAH...happy  urlLink chinese new year  everybody. gong xi fa cai (no cantonese from me, puah).   somebody shake me cuz i i must be sleeping     edit 10:42 PM: i guess i should explain what happened during my multi-genre project presentation (red pollard, seabiscuit's jockey). it went all right, i showed a clip of seabiscuit -- a race at the santa anita handicap -- and everyone wanted to watch more. i neatly segued between my genres (a lame fan letter and a somewhat amusing poem that allowed me to do bust out my wannabe ghetto gesticulations again) and a few tidbits about depression-era america and horse racing in general. then i did my skit. UTTER CRAP. what was i smoking when i thought it up? it only superficially touched on seabiscuit (and only then it was the movie), and i found myself talking about guys' pectoral muscles, and then singing a shirley temple song, and then jump-kicking myself. WHY DID I DO IT. pah.   i remember being so excited about it last night and practicing the choreography of the fight for about half an hour so i wouldn't slip. then when i actually got to it during my presentation, i realized how retarded it was. but considering i already spent so much time prepping for it, i thought i might as well see it through. but then mr. brown calls me over and tells me (in an excessively gruff voice in retrospect) that my song might've offended nadine (who did shirley temple, which inspired idiotic me to do the song since shirley temple once did a seabiscuit movie). one of the worst sensations ever. i suddenly didn't want to talk, i didn't have the energy to keep my head off my desk, i didn't want to think because i might dwell over why i did it, i just wanted to go home and sleep. hence, i was half-awake during the entireity of focus. i was better after that, but then i walk into chem and hosniya asks me to reenact the song, ergo i relive the incident again. DAMN THE WORLD.
