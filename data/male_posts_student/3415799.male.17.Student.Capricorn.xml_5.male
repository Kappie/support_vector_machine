While i was online the other day i happened to be browsing aimlessly through profiles and i found something rather intriguing. Intriguing that it was a report from Cambridge university and intriguing that Cambridge had produced a report which was actually intriguing for a change. The report stated that through thorough research it became known that poelpe colud raed wrods whituot the wrods bineg in the crocret odrer jsut as lnog as the frsit and lsat ltetres sayetd the smae. I found this particularly interesting as i've never noticed it before, but when i think about it i find that i do this on a day to day basis - normally when trying to communicate with some of my partially illiterate friends who are too quick on a keyboard to actually acknowledge what they are doing. Fascinating...well i like to think so...
