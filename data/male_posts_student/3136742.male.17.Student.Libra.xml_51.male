This is definitely the funniest, most entertaining book I've ever read. The only thing that's made me laugh this hard is  urlLink "The Incredible Ryan's Steakhouse Story"  (actually, nothing's ever made me laugh harder than that, and I'm not a huge fan of that kind of humor either. I don't know anyone who's read that and not cried laughing... I've read it multiple times and by the last page my stomach hurts from laughing so hard.)... So AWITW, very clever. Bryson's transitions from sounding like a PBS-History-Special to side-splitting narratives quite seamlessly. I haven't read anything like it, so it's a fresh change. I highly recommend it, but don't be daunted by the first chapter, it can be dry. The rest of the book is hilarious.
