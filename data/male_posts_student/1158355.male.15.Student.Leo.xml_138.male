This one, I learned kung fu, beat up some Asian dude that attempted to kill me and steal my money, the fight went from the movies all the way to Grand Union. We fought long and hard. Then my sister was stolen because she had vital information about the government, my dad was too lazy to go save her and so was I, and she finally came home at the end of the dream. Mr. Tringali had saved the world from rapid rising temperatures by digging a hole near my house (Thrush and Cygnet), dug it 5 feet down and 5 feet to the right and came to a valve at the origin of Earth (0,0). This doesn't make any sense but dreams just shoot at you random feedback from days before, I had a test in Math the other day on locuses and circles on graphs so that explains it. So with a great deal of mathmatical precision, Mr. Tringali had turned the valve and saved this world once again! Crazy dreams. Yesterday was Thanksgiving, not Turkey Day, you fools. I went to my cousins. It was awesome. Lots of food throwing and flinging, watching Dan play Silent Hill 3 where dogs with no heads and Montazumas come out to eat you, and to top it all all, playing Mario Party 5 for about 3 hours and laughing our asses off to things that aren't even funny. I also kung fued everyone which leads into my crazy dream. Well that's all, so bye bye folks...I mean that's all folks!
