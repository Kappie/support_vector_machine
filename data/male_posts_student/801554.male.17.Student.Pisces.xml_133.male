Anyway, this weekend I went out of town, got some good reading done, read A Short History of Nearly Everything, I forget who wrote it right now, you may have heard of it. Good stuff. Got back Sunday afternoon and went to Sadie Hawkins dance at school, that was fun. Went out for Japanese food prior to the dance, someplace I'd never been before, very interesting. Monday I had off, went over to a good friend of mine's house (whose name also happens to be Ryan, wierd coincidence) and played some PS2 and billiards (I'd never really played before, but I picked it up quickly).   I learned something interesting the other day: Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, yes we got the day off for it, but Charles Darwin was also born on the dame day. Same year, even! So monday I celebrated Darwin's birthday as well.  Gotta go, some quadratic equations await my perusal. More later, as always.
