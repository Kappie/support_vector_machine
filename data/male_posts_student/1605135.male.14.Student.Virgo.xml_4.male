For some reason I completely hate them, more so than other bugs (which I'm not exactly fond of either).  Maybe it's the weird, pudgy bodies.  Maybe it's the eerie metallic hum that sounds like aliens are invading (and is a sound as intense at close range as a jet plane taking off, or so I've heard).  Or maybe it's the fact that I can hardly take a step without stepping on them or their shells.  I just don't like cicadas.  It's not that I'm scared of them, but the people who pick them up, carry them around, let them walk on their bodies, and eat them are pretty crazy in my opinion.  I help coach my 11-year old brother Dylan's baseball team (my dad's the head coach) and I was at their game on Saturday.  (We lost 31-5, but that's not really relevent right now.)  The first base side of the field is right next to the woods, and we were the visitors.  (For those who don't know baseball, the visiting team's bench is on the first base side and the home team's bench is on the third base side.)  So cicadas were everywhere.  For some reason or another I let someone know I don't exactly like cicadas, so the next thing I know one of the players and the seven-year old brother of another are collecting them and trying to get them on me.  Fun.  Probably more enjoyable than focusing on the 26 run loss, though.
