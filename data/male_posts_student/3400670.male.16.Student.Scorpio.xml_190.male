I really like my topic and I can't wait to do my project. I think Mrs. VA was right when she said that you should do something that is meaningful to you.  OK, college Portfolio questions... It says we need to apply to at least three scholarships. I don't know about other people but I'm having a hard time finding scholarships. All the ones that I want to do the deadlines have already passed. Can we use them for the project even if the deadline has passed? Finally, I saw the Skyview band in the Starlight Parade on TV. It was cool, great job you guys!
