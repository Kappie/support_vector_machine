Often, I fight the urge and find out later that there's been a plane crash, a fire bomb in a night club or some other such catastrophe. As I tuned it, the saddest news I have encountered in a very long time radiated from the speakers of my car; the space shuttle Columbia was out of contact and presumed lost. Interviews then followed with residents of Palestine, Texas - citizens claiming that they had seen the predictable approach of Columbia on a landing run explode into a shower of green and orange debris. It pains me to realize that this is the second space shuttle I have had the misfortune of witnessing explode. A scant few days ago I found the old photograph of the Challenger I purchased as a little boy at Cape Canaveral. I saw Columbia on that visit - it was a beautiful white whale of a ship, something that has always inspired me when I think of space travel. It is my firm belief that the future of our species lies in exploring the space around us - the loss of these seven lives and the shuttle could jeopardize the program's momentum for many years to come. I only pray the ISS remains on schedule.  To the seven aboard the shuttle - may you go with which God or diety you may or may not believe in. Thank you for taking the risk.
