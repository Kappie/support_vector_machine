So I met him on Saturday. I like him. He's nice.   Last Saturday night we were talking, and he commented something about this guy he was dating. I won't go into the gruesome details, I'll just said what today still lingers on me... He said that he did not like this guy, and as a matter of leading him into the truth, when he called him on the phone, he answered with words like "pal", "dude", etcetera.  But why do I mention this? 'Cause we've been talking for the last three days and suddendly, now I pick words from his conversation like "buddie", "bro" ... Am I reading too much into it? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.  I asked him out to the movies on Thursday; would have been this invitation three weeks ago, I think he would have said yes... Now, he just keep postponing. Man, How lucky am I?  But what to say about this guy? Mmmh! I want to find words that, well, safe ones. He's really nice, great smile [ Big, big teeth. I like that ]. I thought that by now I would've had an answer. *Sigh!  When my relationship with Adrian finished there were two guys that I felt were the real deal for me. Those two guys were cool and mannered. They felt real! I did not want to jinx a possible relation with one of them right away by dating them when I still had feelings for Adrian... or while it still hurts. In that intro, of months, I lost one by him moving away. And Victor [ the guy I'm talking about today ] got tired of trying to have a date and as result I lost contact with him for a good time. We reconnected in May, by a chance of the dice; I was Online and he popped on the messenger. We talked and he mentioned about me being a little too high maintenance and leading him to believe I was just not interested. We kept talking till we found ourselves saying good bye again but with a renewed friendship.  After a long hiatus, I found him again online last Saturday. I was ready to what he had to offer. We had a date that night. I won't talk about the details, I'll just say that what happend, what I heard while I was in bed [ and him on the sofa ] made me think, made me believe there was the chance of a relationship... Now, I just don't know. Well see.  He's funny, and Really smart. Still, a little bit younger... He'll be 22 this august. Well I like him. I know is too soon to be thinking about it. But I rather think it straight than just going with maybe's. Now, the big question is what does he think. Will he be ok dating me? Will he be prepared to a relationship? [ Oops! Relationship? Even I got scared of it! Yeah is too soon to be flaunting that word! ]. Seems I'll have to wait.  Wait and hope. Hope for the best .
