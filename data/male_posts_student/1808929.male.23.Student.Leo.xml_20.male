Yep, and I've even managed to get some of my med school friends interested in the game. It's going to be a good one.  It's been a rainy day today, and rainy days seem to make for reflective days. You know, the kind where you do more thinking than usual. Today I've been working on a clinical medicine assignment that's required a little right brain thinking. It's called a "spiritual history." It's just a quick statement that I thought I'd add on to this blog. It's kinda deep though, so be careful reading it.   Faith  Practice I am not a religious person. I don’t follow any faith though my family is Christian. However I do believe that there is a reason for everything that happens in this world and that there is an order at work that we don’t completely understand. There are two somewhat spiritual practices that I follow through the best and worst of times, namely meditation and writing.  My meditation practice simply involves finding a calm place and clearing my mind with varying breathing exercises and postures. It is difficult to articulate exactly how meditation works for me, but I can say that it calms and centers me in a way that allows me to confront life’s daily problems with a joy and clarity that I would not have otherwise. Writing, on the other hand, is my way of remembering important life experiences. My life is a collection of events and situations that have some meaning, and since my memory is so poor one of the best ways I learn and grow spiritually is to document meaningful experiences and reflect on them.   Importance Our society is extremely forward-looking, prospective, and it never looks back. Our days are mapped out in hourly schedules and even those individual hours are sectioned by successive powerpoint slides. Meditation and writing are both my ways of breaking out of this seemingly endless pattern. One of the primary goals of meditation is to take one’s conscious thought away from a timetable so that one may simply enjoy being in the present. Bringing myself back to the present moment free of all other external and internal influences is invaluable. I consider writing, however, to be my retrospective practice. It allows me to look backwards in time on my life experiences and give them some kind of meaning, great or small. Both of these practices help me appreciate my past and present as my foundation.
