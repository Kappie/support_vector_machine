In the tradition of sounding like a complete alarmist I'm going to keep two weeks wages in cash at home; you really can't trust your bank anymore.  Chad's wedding was quite lovely. I wasn't aware but he and his new wife both have lovely voices. I didn't eat much of the dinner, for some reason I wasn't really hungry.  Tonight is inventory - or "Full count" as it is referred to. That means I'm most likely going to get to work a 14 hour shift. When I scheduled it, I started at 5. Rob has me starting at one.  Sometimes the sheer vapidity of it escapes me.  Then there are times like this. I'm going to break something.
