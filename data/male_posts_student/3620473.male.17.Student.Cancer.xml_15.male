I had a UPS damage problem, so a guy is pissed at me, i had to ship some other stuff, i sold some other stuff, i scanned some pictures, i took a shower and damn those shower heads work wonders, neck and back feel much better. u really need to try it to understand.... nothing O:-)  went to seans in the lat afternoon. helped make dinner there then played a game of life. i almost won without going to college, hooray! lol then we went bowling, and i forgot how much fun that can be. then again i was just in a damned good mood. i was de-stressing, like i told me to, and damn u had a big part in that.  but yeah, im going to bed now, cause when I wake up, it will be that much closer to time to see you. and with that, i pronounce this chapter of the blog done. It will stay here as long as it can, but i doubt i will continue posting, as I now have the real wonderful you once more. I love you michelle, I do, I do. *mwah*
