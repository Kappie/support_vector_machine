I do agree with them sometimes, but not all the time. Here are my own personal comments on all the ten contestants, but I can't really remember all of them, especially their names. So, here it goes:  Contestant #01: Amanda - Thin; sounded like Anastacia. Contestant #02: ?????? - Ok-ok ler... Contestant #03: ?????? - Nice voice; the 'face'... Contestant #04: ?????? - ?????? Contestant #05: Andrew - Ok also, a bit nervous; a bit dull; looks like a HK star. Contestant #06: Anis   - A controlled performance; but looks old. Contestant #07: Rinie  - A bit too short although she was wearing heels; good voice. Contestant #08: Victor - English can be improved; his teeth; his performance? argh... Contestant #09: Rydee  - Sexy voice, but out of tune... Contestant #10: Aisha  - Didn't like the way she walks and her pair of shoes... Contestant #11: Fazly  - His outfit sucks; his teeth; english; hair  My choices: Andrew, Anis  Rinie. Least favourite: Victor, Rydee  Contestant #2.   Anyway, I did a quiz just now again.      Rabisu: The Devourers   Devourers are the warriors among the fallen, given charge of the beasts of the wilderness and infused with the nature of the predator. They are fierce and impulsive by course, favoring action over long-winded discussion. They incite, ravage, annihilate and move on.       urlLink   Choose your Place in Hell.     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
