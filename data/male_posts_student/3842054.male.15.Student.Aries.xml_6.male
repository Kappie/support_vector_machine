Today Shaq became an official member of the miami heat, i was excited. I watched two hours of coverage on his press conference, and it was really enjoyable. He has one of the biggest personalitys of anyone i've ever seen.     Surprisingly, I wasnt that bored today even with brittney not talking to me until 9:00 at night.  So i guess i dont need her. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.     So i went to Katies later on... Her little minions were over again... surprise. Her entire family could be wiped out in a horrible car accident, and they would still show up looking for free entimans pre-packaged coffee cakes. (Not that i dont eat uncontrolably from that house, but I am part of that family...)     So me, Katie and Kimmy, Katies sister went to work out at the YMCA. They got membership recently, and so we went. So cute, lifting 10 pounds... silly woman... think they can get muscles... SO CUTE... They know the gym is a place of work for the man, if they spend time at the gym, thats one less hour in the kitchen mopping, WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE! Is he kidding, is he not? Who knows?    Then Karen, Katies mom brought us for ice cream. We ate dinner. Watched sportscenter, then i went out and played Basketball with my brothers. Pretty eventful day. I liked it. Nothing on tv, but im in a pretty good mood, baring the Marlins pull one out tonight... Ok, well goodnight... Oh, here's part two of the songs that are important to a  lot of people in the world... its a long one folks.    Something Corporate   Konstantine     I can't imagine all the people that you know And the places that you go When the lights are turned down low And I don't understand all the things you've seen But I'm slipping in between You and your big dreams It's always you In my big dreams  And you tell me that it's over Wake up lying in a patch Of four leaf clovers And you're restless And I'm naked You gotta get out You can't stand to see me shakin No... Would you let me go? I didn't think so..  And you don't wanna be here in the future So you say the present's just a pleasent Interruption to the past And you don't wanna look much closer Cause you're afraid to find out all this hope You had sent into the sky By now had..crashed And it did...Because of me..  And then you bring me home Afraid to find out that you're alone And I'm sleeping in your living room We don't have much room..to live  I had these dreams In them I learned to play guitar Maybe cross the country Become a rock star And there was hope in me that I could take you there But damnit you're so young Well I don't think I care  And if I hurt you then I'm sorry Please don't think that this was easy  And then you bring me home Cause we both know what it's like to be alone And I'm dreaming in your living room We don't have much room To live  And Konstantine is walking down the stairs Doesn't she look good standing in her underwear And I was thinkin..what I was thinkin We've been drinking And it doesn't get me anywhere  My Konstantine came walking down the stairs And all that I could do was touch her long, blonde hair And I've been thinking It hurts me thinking That these nights when we were drinking No they never got us anywhere  No..  This is because I can spell konfusion with a k And I can like it It's to dying in another's arms And why I had to try it It's to Jimmy Eat World And those nights in my car When the first star you see may not be a star I'm not your star Isn't that what you said What you thought this song meant  And if this is what it takes Just to laugh with my mistakes And live with what I did to you All the hell I put you through I always catch the clock It's 11:11 And now you wanna talk It's not hard to dream You'll always be my Konstantine  My Konstantine  They'll never hurt you like I do No..They'll never hurt you like I do  No, No..No No No No No No..  This is to a girl Who got into my head With all the pretty things she did And you know You keep me up in bed  This is to a girl Who got into my head With all these fucked up things I did Hey..maybe..baby You could keep me up in bed  My Konstantine  You spin around me like a dream We played out on this movie screen And I said..  Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? Did you know I miss you? I miss you  And then you'd bring me home And we go to sleep But this time not alone..no no And you'll kiss me in your living room I know..I know you'll miss me in your living room Cause these nights I think maybe that I'll miss you in my living room  We don't have much room I said does anybody need that room? Because we all need a little more room To live..  My Konstantine    That is a very long song ladies and gentleman. I've only listened to the whole thing twice, and i barely understand teh meaninng of it... im trying though. Hopefully you actually read it.
