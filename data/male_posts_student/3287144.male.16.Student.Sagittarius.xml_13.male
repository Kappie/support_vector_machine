So this meant even the back cover was used - very economical! However I didn't know this and thus missed off the final question... Good for the consumption of paper in Ireland, bad for my grade [well 8% of it anyway].  I have also decided that exams are only good for providing an excuse to hug pretty much anyone, a fact I intend to abuse as much as possible over the next few weeks. Also prior to my maths exam a friend came over to 'revise', instead we locked horns in a match of  urlLink Worms World Party , my friend however has an unnatural ability at the game, however today I beat him in the two matches we played. Seems I can win at something, just nothing useful...  Finally I recommend the link at the bottom highly; strange that something so inexplicably annoying can be made to be mildly amusing by calling it a game and adding music but then again by listening to my MP3 player and thinking life is a bit of a game I guess I have done the same for my mildly amusing life.
