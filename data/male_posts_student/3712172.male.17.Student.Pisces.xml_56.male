And yet, what a grand time to make a post since I have slacked off in the blogging department lately.  Recently, I have been working like crazy. My job tends to schedule me really shitty shifts so I have been putting up with that for awhile now.  My move is now done - we are all settled in and I am quite used to living here now - in fact I am enjoying it dearly. This basement apartment makes me feel like I am living on my own - so peaceful, but yet I pay nothing :)  Also recently, I have re-designed my website and have recently registered a domain. My site can now be accessed at  urlLink http://www.tylerkuhk.com  Check it out :)  I re-did some of my life thoughts and have been coming up with ideas on what else to post. I have written some thoughts / opinions on suicide, friends, truth and trust. I will post them up shortly.   Anyways, just wanted to make a quick post as I need to get to sleep. I have a long, enduring 10.5 hour shift tomorrow.   .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Bye everyone. And don't worry - my blogger attitude is kicked back into drive :P
