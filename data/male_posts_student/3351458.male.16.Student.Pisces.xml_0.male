Holidays then represented the only time I could stop studying and just sit around the whole day doing nothing but popping of German soldiers like a bunch of daisies in a WWII game. Now? Erhhh.... Let's face it. I mix with a lot of high-achievers. Unfortunately, I ain't one of them.   All   my best friends are truly very busy people. One's got camp, the other's probably involved in some church thing, while another is always off on jamming sessions in town. Fact is, everyone's got something to do. Everyone, that is, except for ME! I'm stuck at home, always pondering my next move. Sleep, eat or do homework. Is it any wonder why I look like a rugby player? At this rate, I'll be a sumo wrestler soon...Terrible. There isn't even anything to do in the chatrooms. It's so lame in there. Everyone's either hitting on another person or playing with the trivia bot. No perverts for me to kick or ban. Damn! I remember how I used to look forward to banning those clowns. Problem is, those clown's aren't even around anymore!!  At least there's been a FEW happenings around to keep me alive. The most interesting of all, an interestling skirmish between my mum and eight other women which happened after an accident occurred. Would've been a hit-and-run, if it wasn't for my mum's sudden switch to Maniac Mode. Sincerely, for once, I think my mum could've taken on all eight of them and thrashed the hell out of 'em, thanks to the rage she was in. Hmm, makes me wonder what my dad would've done...  Amusing. I think this blog will be seeing a lot of me these holidays. Well, at least until my comp comes back. Then I'll get on with popping more enemy soldiers...
