WTF! richard and eugene got taller than me, abdullah is like 6 feet now, melissa t bought a kid's meal...! who buys kids' meals these days? well, maybe if they're giving teenie beanie babies, but still. amita recapitulated (sat word :D) about her famous day at stanford beach? or something, where she broke the guinness book of world records for guys picked up in an hour. then parisa and rricha (two r's!) talked about lairy fights (teehee) and how the ending of book 5 DID SUCK. then i tried to eat and failed miserably cuz of my mouth, but parisa's gonna have to take out all 4 wisdom teeth together (puahahahha).  back at school, stupid cheers (what happened to richard? "1600? of course i get 1600 all the time selling my drugs man, it's the hip thing to do"), then the fake link groups which was good cuz my ass got really numb sitting for so long. then i was inexplicably chosen for the 2nd example, which was stupid cuz i talked during the first game and someone called me "chang" in the second game. then liss complained about her senior pics (which i'm going to see, someday...) and me and alex walked home in sorta pitch blackness. all in all pretty good, but only to see people cuz we learned literally nothing.
