I think (if I can remember correctly), that I did some biology revision. Oh yes, that was it. All about genetics, which we haven't done anything about during class. Foolish teacher. Chromosomes, DNA, zygotes, it all gets very confusing, especially if you are learning it for the first time. That took a while, and, oh yes, I remember what happened. My sister has been back from university for Easter, and she was using the computer all day, and that was why I was so bored. Wow, what a sad life I lead - reduced to boredom when being prevented of computer usage. I really need to find some sort of a hobbey, other than internet browsing. And revsion. Reading I suppose, but that's not really a hobbey. I don't play any sports, which I probably should, as I probably don't get enough exercise (he says as he scoffs down a Cadbury's Cream Egg - half price in Sainsburys apparently) - but as you may have read in a previous blog, I hate nearly all sports I have tried. Oh well, bugger hobbeys. I'm sure I'll manage.  Sunday was different to the normal day, being as I went down to Bristol again, to take my sister to university in my other sister's car. And... SERVICE STATIONS!!!! I need a rant about those somewhere. Seemingly ok from the outside, but terrifyingly (sp?) expensive on the inside. Â£4 for a baguette! We ended up getting two and having 2/3 of one each, plus 2 coffees, again, drastically expensive. I really should open my own. You can charge whatever you like, and a lot of people will buy the stuff anyway as there is nowhere else to go. Very Price Inelastic (there you go business studies teacher - I knew I would get that in a sentence one day). Well, after the painfully expensive lunch, we headed on towards the small-ish city on the mouth of the River Severn. Arriving there, I had a go on the computer (22 mb broadband.... drool...) and then in the evening my sisters took/dragged me to the cinema to see 'Scooby Doo 2' - a fairly abysmal film, no-where near as good as the first one, which wasn't very good. Predictable, bad story line, terrible jokes... couldn't even raise a snigger from me. Cinema was nice though. Comfy seats, with loads of leg-room. Not like that damn poetry conference the english teachers took us to...(wait 'til I get 'em... stupid cheap seats.... think they can get away with that... I'll show 'em... legs crammed up against the back of the seat infront.... stupid... kill 'em...) although the place was a bit dirty, and the cleaners were only picking up rubbish 10 minutes before the film was sheduled to start. That's another thing! I really hate people who leave their rubbish in cinemas after a film. I ALWAYS take my rubbish and put it in the bin, at least, if I had any - I never buy food in cinemas, way too expensive. Well, back to the house by 22:00, and I slept in a spare room (all the other residents of the shared house were away).   And then this morning I came back with the older of my two sisters. Decided to eat lunch before we went this time. After a quick stop at Tesco on the way back, we got home at about 17:00. Dinner, and now here I am. That's about all for today folks, ta ta.   Playing:  Nothing at the moment  Listening To:  Star Wars Techno-remixs - better than they sound.  Watching:  Nothing today so far - maybe 'The Mummy' later  Annoyed With:  Service stations  Confused About:  Chromsomes  Mood:  Content
