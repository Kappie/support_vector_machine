That word to me, "offended," is so annoying now.. no one can stand to be "offended." They have to stay in their little box, surrounded only by the beliefs and ideas they hold true, and when someone tries to show them another side to something, they scream, "DONT OFFEND ME!" and curl up into the fetal position. Everything must be censored, trimmed, cropped, critiqued, and conformed so it will be perfectly, utterly unopinionated, and perfectly, utterly bland. -sigh- To expect everyone to be perfectly composed and not offend ANYONE, all of the time, is like expecting the world to be a perfect place; it's not going to happen.[/QUOTE]   Ooo! That was good! May I quote you?   I agree that you need to show a *little* constraint, but sometimes i feel the urge to slap people and tell them to sit down, calm down, and shut up- just for a second!    The way people always feel like they're always being offended is sickening- I've kinda gotten interested in psychology latley(not any advanced stuff... just basic principles), and i've found that Extinction works really well. Extinction is basically a more scientific term for ignoring someone. When you stop paying attention to them, they go away.  So when I get people calling me a "white boy," or anything, i'm like "Okay. Your point is?"  Because, unlike a number of white people these days, I realize that I am white and have no problem with it. So when they call me white, you can tell that's meant to be an insult, and when i show them that it means nothing to me, they stop because it's not fun anymore.  Now, don't give me all this "oh, other races get treated worse!" crap, it barely ever happens anymore. And, can you tell me how us white people are supposed to NOT be racist when almost all non-white stand-up comedians do the "white people walk like this" joke?  See? See? I've found loopholes in society, go me!
