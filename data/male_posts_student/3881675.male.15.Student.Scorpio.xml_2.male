Went to brighton yesterday and spent most of the days in eastbourne. i ought to buy a house there someday and start my own recording studio. the place is so damn peaceful and there are plenty of nice gardens and parks to chill in and a whole seafront to check out.  also saw some interesting films in the past couple o' days. the first film was called stigmata which was a about some random woman who starts getting random wounds of which belonged to christ and gets help from a hardcore priest. the film i saw last night was horrific. it was called the hole and it was basically about these four teenagers who go partying in an underground bunker and get trapped. it was so hardcore i ordered the book off amazon this morning. and at the moment i have termintor 2 pumping from the TV.  god my throat hurts...i've gotta cut down on the crisps and chocolates and shit...
