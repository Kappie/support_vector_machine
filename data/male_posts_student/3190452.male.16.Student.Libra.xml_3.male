However, that is more or less the extent of my doing-stuffification, most of the time I stayed home and either wallowed in my own misery and self loathing or played System Shock 2 (Geekyness +1). I do not even currently have gainful employment, given that I cannot truly be arsed. Work may or may not be better than self loathing, I'm not quite sure, but I'm willing to bet that it isn't.
