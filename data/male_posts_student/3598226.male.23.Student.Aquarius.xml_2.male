And then there are days like today.  I felt like Sisyphus just pushing that old rock up the hill to see it fall down again.  Except this time the rock rolled over my big phreakin toe on it's joyride to the bottom of the hill.  My boss overruled a decision she had previously approved.  I conducted second interviews for candidates that just weren't qualified for the job.  I put another person on disciplinary probation.  I'm worried about moving to Houston and finding a place to live.  The list just goes on and on.  And you know it's really bad when you get tired of hearing yourself whine.  Oh I need a vodka martini right about now, hun.  So in an attempt to make sense of all of this without turning to that blissful beverage, I've picked up Ticht Naht Hahn's meditation book.  And that's good - I tried it out, but when I lost my focus, I lost my drive.  Mindfulness is really hard (*there goes that whining again, gosh darnit*).  Well, I'm gonna go give it another shot.  On the upshot, the phone I'm selling on eBay got it's second bid.  YEE-HAWWWWW!!!  I'm just giddy with the thought of making money on eBay!   urlLink
