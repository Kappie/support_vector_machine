I suppose I could start designing my cd cover and actually doing some work but I'm really tired and I have to more weeks to do it. Well anyways right now I'm really annoyed because well I'm really tired and I'm getting extremely tired of being thought of as a person that people can talk about and walk all over. It seems as though when I dont talk people badger me and ask me whats wrong but when I do talk they want to challenge me on everything I say and critique my work and tell me that I'm wrong. And whenever I challenge what people say they say damn Pat why are you so mean. But I cant help if I speak my mind whenever I need to.   But whatever I'm not going to let people get to me. A good trait about me is the fact that I'm never really down and the fact that I can speak my mind makes it so people know that I'm not a person to be messed around with. Well neways nothing has happened to day, yet so ill go back to tommorow. I had a kinda lousy day first I didnt get to practice after school and I ended up just driving Chelsea home. I didnt want to fight traffic getting home so I just stayed there for a while and watched making the video "Brittney Spears" and she is such a dits its horrible. I mean she's hott and she's aloud to be a slut because she can have anyone she can. But she is so ditsy. Neway when i got home I tried to turn on my laptop and it wouldnt work so I was sitting there hella mad and bored and I couldnt do anything. I had to go to costco and return my comp and get a new one. I lost everything i had and it sucked. So yea crappy day yesterday maybe today, dunno it started out crappy though. Well Payce
