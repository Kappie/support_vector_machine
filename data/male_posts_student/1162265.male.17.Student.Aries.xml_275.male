If you do not have that within you, what you do not have within you [will] kill you."  -Gospel of Thomas  Can't really think of an update, so I'll just leave it at this.  Oh yeah, I don't like Kerry, almost as much as I don't like Bush.  In some ways I'm glad I don't have to give myself up too the two party system since I'll miss the election by 5 months.
