I think this may be one pivotal issue where Rob has a more conservative stand than I do. It's great through, read it...Just ignore the irony of him spelling 'neanderthal' wrong, among other words, he just didn't spell check. :P As for my thoughts?  Right here:  Feminism is competing for the top of the list of stupid causes for the  underemployed . People, you're losing your edge. Women don't have rights? Here's a right for you: shut up about being underpaid and all this incredibly bullshitty bullshit! My Mom works, she gets paid just as much as anyone else there. It doesn't even have anything to do with equal pay anymore, it's unemployed activist ugly fat women who can't shut up and be happy!   If you weigh 300 pounds don't complain that there is pressure on female appearance, be an  activist  and get off the goddamn couch! Feminism is an excuse for being ugly and lazy.  So, in order to clear up the jargon the dikes use, I'll write a quick  3-point feminism translation guide . It's all you need to know.  "We're underpaid." == "Give us money, we're lazy." "Women in the workplace." == "We don't want anyone to be more successful than us." "Too much pressure on female appearance." == "I'm ugly/fat/disfigured."  Gay pride, feminism, racism, sexism, and all other 'causes' don't need to be paraded, they need to be held up in a court of law! If someone punches you because you're black, good for you, sue their asses off and play the racism card! If someone punches you because you're white, good for you, sue their asses off and play the racism card! Yes, racism and all this stuff exist, and they're wrong, but they need to be dealt with by a man (or   woman  ) in a court of law, not some ugly fat woman with a shaved head waddling down the street holding a sign, a sign she had to get her son to write because she never went to school, she was too busy being paid for doing  shit , just complaining all day.  Damn you! Love, Sean
