On one side, you have spiritual leaders saying that the Bible is the main story of creation. On the other side of the boxing ring, you see scientists proving their theory of evolution.  Scientists have proven that monkeys actually have blood that is almost identical to the human DNA, making it possible for blood transfusions. Also, the Bible says that everything happened in seven days, but science has proven that no man has ever been alive during the age of the dinosaur, possibly meaning a "day" was an "era" in the formation of The earth.  Take below the quotes as you wish. The story of creation: Evolution style.  "In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the warth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters."  The part "The earth was a formless wasteland" most likely means that earth was still gathering dust from the nebula, gaining matter, and making a suitable spot for life to form.  "Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw how good the light was. God then separated the light from the darkness. God called the light "day," and the darkness He called "night." Thus evening came, and morning followedâ€”the first day."  The light forming was the sun's hydrogen atoms collecting together in dense, intense heat. The pressure became so great, that the sun ignited and became our star. The light and night was actually a very old explanation of how the world saw night and day. Remember, this was back in the days when they didn't have any NASA satellites.  Well, those are just some examples. I hope you find more examples than I do. If so, then by all means, share them!  In conclusion, Science is not our guide to the bible, but the bible is our guide to science.
