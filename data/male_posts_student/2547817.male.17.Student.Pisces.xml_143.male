I was not polite to her about it but she was calm and still explained it to me like I was 5 years old. I miss the simplicity of 5 year olds. I miss the shelter.  Peter Pan was wise!  Daddy called me after I spoke with Mummy and he spoke to me about the Indian thing too. THAT MEANS THAT MUMMY AND DADDY TALK! THAT'S GREAT!!! Daddy told me never to look upon suffering without compassion. THAT'S SPIDERMAN MATERIAL MAN! My father is wise. It's just that he behaves like a lunatic. But under the joker that he currently is he's wise and I never thought I'd be saying this, but I'm proud he's my Dad! Sure he says scarring things and does even more scarring things, but I know he loves us and that's what counts if you ask me. Judge a person by who they are now, not who they were. Some would say don't judge at all. I say bullshit (till I learn better) coz I have my say too.  About what he said, it's funny, looking back on my day. I had to go to the police station to make a report about a "lost card" on behalf of Dr. Ali. I was fully aware that he was using me, but I did it anyway. Ho. So there were people talking to the cop on duty. I squatted with literature in hand in front of a post box. It was dusk. About 3 meters to my left, there was a senile old man talking to himself and across the road was the kindly-looking old lady that didn't speak, but asked for money. I had dinner with Pati, Yi Peng and Yap yesterday. Pati told me that the old lady'd buy liquor with her nightly collection. There's so much hurt, pain and suffering greater than our's about us friends. Just look. Maybe what Daddy said might be of use to you.  Thought a lot about a friend today. I remembered things. A sidetrack from war literature. It doesn't feel right inserting it here. I'll tell you right now instead. Ask me what I remembered. I'll keep it for some time it'll have more of a lasting impact. I'm learning to use my material selectively.
