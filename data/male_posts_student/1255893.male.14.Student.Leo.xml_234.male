The folks were planning to take us to some huge potluck w/ their co-workers... but luckily we aren't going anymore. I don't like to seem anti-social, but I guess I can be sometimes. I hate those huge gatherings. Too much tension and pressure to try to get along w/ everyone, and if I try to not give a damn my parents would get pissed at me. Oh well, no need to worry about it anymore.   We got to eat Jack In The Box for dinner. Me and my sis got in a fight over who would get which amount of which currency (10 dollars or 100 pesos.) We were laughin our asses off when we figured out they were pretty much the same amount.  Saw Spider-Man 2 on Wednesday. There was less of a line than I thought there would be. Maybe people thought there would be a huge rush the 1st few days, so they would come later. The movie was really good, but if you hadn't seen the 1st one it would have been better. I expected too much, and when I got what I wanted, I didn't realize it. Just like what happened w/ The Matrix. I guess the trick to getting some of these sequals right is to not compare them to their predecessor.   Woah, I'm sleepy. Must go.
