Yes gentle reader, I am pretty anal.    This is the first time I have blogged with an active and participative audience. I refer to the boos from the rear stalls. Or do I refer to the booze from the rear stalls?    No I am not drunk.    I am quite sure.    Notice I do not ramble on and on.    I am supposed to blog for someone else. I will be a ghost blogger. I will dress up in a white sheet and blog all over the place.    Yessss I continue to amaze myself with my inanity. Or insanity. My audience says "Or both".    I moon the audience.    So there.    Nyah nyah.    Nyah Nyah to you too, gentle reader.    Um yes I amtwenty fiveyears old, not six as I might seem from the previous statements.    My audience is pelting me with tomatoes. And bottles of beer.    Yay!    Dammit! Empty bottles.    Well I should bLog off.    My audience is a trifle annoying. Think fingernails on a blackboard type annoying.    Yesssss, You do know what I mean.    Later...    The cat says Hi.    And Meow!    Well just meow. I made up the hi.
