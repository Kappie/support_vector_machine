I did not attend school for five days. I really missed a lot of topics! I got sick of eating soft foods... I really looked fat... Everyone in the house teased me... I missed singing my heart out... I got tired of papa's sermons aout the damn scholarship... My seelping patters have changed... I only sleep due to the effect of the medicines... And... I got tired of watching TV!
