The waves could be heard as they viciously hit the side of the shack. With each pounding of the waves, more of the outer wall was being taken away. Lake Doom was living up to its name. It was devouring everything that had set itself up along the shores. Elensar, in a desperate move to save himself and his home, ran outside in the terrifying storm to seek the help of anyone that he came across. He needed to find someone that could help him keep his house from being taken by the waves. He ran blindly in the pouring ran, trying to make his way for the town not too far away. The winds started to pick up and soon they were strong enough to make him loose his footing. He fell several times while pushing to make his way to the town. He tried for hours but soon realized that he was getting nowhere near his goal. The winds were just too strong for him. He started to turn when he heard a thwack, then everything went black. He awoke to birds chirping. His head was pounding and he had to fight to keep from falling down as he tried to stand up. When he steadied himself he realized that the storm had passed and now the sun was shinning bright. The pitch-black waters of Lake Doom were now eerily silent. Elensar took a step forward only to fall to the ground again. He got up groaning and looked back to see what had tripped him. It was a giant trout. He crawled over to it and saw that the wet golden scales were covered with words from his native tongue. He picked up the Golden Trout and read: One Trout to rule them all, One Trout to find them, One Trout to bring them all and in the water bind them.   And well since that had nothing to do with anything, I will go to sleep now so maybe I will become sane in the morning.  -  Dark Lily  0>--}----
