I took these screens throughout the course of an online game last night:   urlLink    When aircraft go down, the debris flies all over.   urlLink    The artillery explosions are fantastic.   urlLink    The artillery also looks great in-flight.   urlLink    The water looks fantastic in this game, possibly the best I've ever seen.   urlLink    The dropships are fascinating. You can upgrade them in all sorts of categories.   urlLink    I love how you can look up at the sky, and actually have somthing worthwhile there. This screenshot doesn't really do the actual thing justice.  If I get some spare time tomorrow, I'll write up a review of this game. We've got a LAN party tomorrow afternoon so I don't know if I'll get to it. Probably sometime in the evening.  This Hello/Bloggerbot thing is great for images. It not only posts images  directly  to your blog, it even hosts them. It's stupendous. If you have a Blogger blog, there's really no other way to get images onto your site.
