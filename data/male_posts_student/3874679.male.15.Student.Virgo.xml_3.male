Thanks appreciated the soon news! Second, we call down there saying we were going to come down and see granny, and they decide that she doesn't want us to see her in that "state". Yeah right and pigs fly! Now yesterday I find out that my granny died, and of course they haven't called to inform us! We had to find out about it on the internet. What great relatives I've got. They don't even care enough to tell me stuff. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT EVERYONE! Well, I hope I never have to talk to them again. The only people down there that really cared was granny and papa slone.Well everyone else can go screw themselves I never want to see them again.
