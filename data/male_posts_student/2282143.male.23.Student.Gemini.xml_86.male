Basically, I learned that Im going to be fat forever.  Fat cells never go away, they just shrink.  Then the moment you start to eat too much again, you get fat faster.  Hence the reason why when you do the quick diet, you end up gaining more back.  The key is the whole behavioral modification thing.  I have to change the way I eat or I will never be at least somewhat thin.  Hell, I dont wanna be 180.  200 will be very nice if I can get there.  Still 20 more lbs to go.  Yargh.  Also learned that abdominal fat is the easiest to lose.  And upon remembering that, Im a huge asshole.  I will just leave it at that.  Anyway, enough with all the fat talk.  Todd is getting his black belt tomorrow.  Im sort of annoyed.  It makes me wonder if my 4 years of training were enough or if he just passed me cause I was paying.  I test again tomorrow for the next step.  Think I might not do the next test after that for another 4 months.  I want to redeem myself by commiting all the Taeguks to memory, as well as the first four Palgues.  I want to make sure I am where I am because of my skill, not because of my money.  Todd is also going into the army at the end of the summer.  Im very surprised why anyone would do this in a time of war.  But hey, its his life, not mine.  I just hope he doesnt get blown up.  I wouldnt wish that on anyone... yargh.  So also, I have decided what I want for my birthday. 1.  256 MB SD card for my digi (about 80 bucks) 2.   urlLink Two Iron Palm bags for beginners   3.   urlLink Music  Yeah, thats all I can think of really.  Right now anyways.   urlLink Oh yeah, go here.  This is funny.  So true though.  Aight.  Im outtie.
