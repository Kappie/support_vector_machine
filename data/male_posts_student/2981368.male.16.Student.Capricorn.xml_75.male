After that game, Philly and the Devils only have 2 games left each...Philly's against Ottawa (H) and the NY Islanders (A), and the Devils have to play Boston home and away. Both teams on 98 points...its the difference between 3rd and 6th...COME ON MONTREAL!!!  Okies, me sound like a sports analyst now. (OH DEAR GOD NO!)  I suggest everyone go d/load "Collective Soul - Not the one". Yup...thats a damn good song there...and its probably the best way to express myself atm. And now...back to UK Gold. (woooo brit comedy!!!)
