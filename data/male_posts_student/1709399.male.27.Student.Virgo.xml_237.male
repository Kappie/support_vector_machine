But Alas, the registration was restricted to only people who had invitation ( Suspiciously sounds like some 16th Century English aristocratic party !!) . All Blogger users were given the invite today (fellow bloggers logon to www.blogger.com ) and I got the login ID I wanted ( Isn't that an achievement in the mail parlance !!) . Hope GMAIL lives upto the tremendous reputation Google has built up in its other products. " Its a small step for mail users but a great leap for the internet ! "
