I then watched my crap that I recorded onto the DVR (4400, Degrassi, GvB, still got the Dead Zone to watch). MAN THE 44000 FUCKING ROCKS!!!! THAT IS THE COOLEST SHOW EVER!! If you haven't seen it you really should. It just started its first season. THey were just testing to see if people liked it (which they did). Last Sunday was the "Finale". I'm not sure when new episodes will be on but you gotta check it out sometime. On channel 27 (USA I believe) sunday nights at 8. It's AWESOME!!!       Tomorrow is my last day of Drivers ED!! YAY!!!!!!! So boring....I can't stand it!!  Then locker checkout is Friday morning! AHHH SCHOOL IS EXACTLY 2 WEEKS AWAY!!! I DON'T WANNA GO BACK THERE!!! Hopefully the year will go by fast though. Well, I'm off to go play some xbox!! (Since that's all I do and have no life, right Stina??? >:O) Hehe...TTYL
