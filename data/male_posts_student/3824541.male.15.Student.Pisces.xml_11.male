I'm not though. Not even angsty. In fact, I had a pretty peaceful day. Not peaceful per se but calm.  Basically, I was sick. Stuffy nost, bad headache, discomfort, the works. I ended up talking to Bobby and Brittney for like 17 hours. Fun. :D.  I'm not sure what else to say. I'm thinking about writing another scene tonight so hopefully I'll get a little inspiration.  Out for now.  -Dan  Warped Tour Update: I bought tickets last night! 2days 15hrs 16mins 53secs till The Warped Tour.
