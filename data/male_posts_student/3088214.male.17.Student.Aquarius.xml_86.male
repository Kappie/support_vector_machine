Whats the difference between stopping something thats going to exist than ceasing something that barely does. A pregnancy is the process of producing a baby, once a mommy and a daddy have sex and the sperm meets the egg that process begins. Whether a person recognizes the possibility of a baby earlier or later, the possibility and probability of a baby are the same in both situations. If one has to use the morning after pill to stop the inevitability of a baby growing, then it is obvious that the person taking the  pill beleives that a baby has been conceived, and wishes to cancel that conception. Cancelling the conception is taking the possibility of existence away from that baby. Now how does that differ from abortion? Due to that, I don't see how people can justify their negative views on abortion while supporting the morning after pill.  When it comes down to it, both methods of ending a pregnancy are ways out for people who are not ready to become parents. And it is my personal opinion that a way out three days after conception does not differ from that of 3 weeks.   -I love you guys,  Chris Mitchem
