The contestants had to lift some weights, get drenched in water, girls rubbed oil over us. It was insane shit. I won 4th place, my bros Thom Jordan won 2nd and Germaine Scott won 1st. Just found the pic on Cody's laptop. Email me and I will send you a copy. I look sweaty and nasty, so does the "hot bodies" model. It was a cheap ass contest and the models were not cute.  roderik_4k@yahoo.com     Where in the world is Ro Kalabastia?   Guess where I am, winner gets a prize.
