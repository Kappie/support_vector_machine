I don't even know if this blog is gonna work. Look at their shitty  urlLink website . I could make a better site using only a post-it note, three rubber bands and a buffalo nickel. Their internet would be more reliable if I wrote a bunch of zeros and ones and sent them by carrier pigeon to their destination. I could outrun their packets. If it's not fixed in like... 20 minutes, somebody is getting a million ninja stars in their EYE.
