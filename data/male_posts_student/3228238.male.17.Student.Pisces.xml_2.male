No matter what state any person's life was in, this conference was aimed at taking the next step closer.  If you will, imagine that Christ is an ocean of love, or grace.  In developing a relationship with him we must step into that ocean, willing to go deeper and deeper.  In the beginning it is hard, the waves are crashing against the sand, and you try to get into the water but the waves continue pushing you over.  But after you take those first steps, the water becomes calmer.  The deeper you go, the calmer the water.  But, many of us don't want to take those steps because we fear the deep water.  Looking back to when I was a young child, the deep end of the pool was terrifying, but now the shallow part would bring me no joy; rather the deepest part of the pool is the most fun, right?!  Therefore, our prayer life (communion with God) must be the same.  We must dive into a relationship with Christ, even if we are afraid, because no worthy prize comes without a struggle.  This was the theme.  Stay tuned as I will continue to write more on my experiences with God during this weekend in Heaven.
