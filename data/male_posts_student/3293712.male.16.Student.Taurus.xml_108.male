I don't think my friends share the sense of adventure I have, and just hopping in my car and driving isn't sufficent fun for them to leave their houses. Sometimes it seems that we spend more time planning things than actually doing them, and this frustrates me.  I don't know why I keep going back to Pirate's Cove, every time I go, I just get pissed and hit fives on every hole. But it isn't the actual game that keeps me coming back, is it? It's the companionship. I feel like my day has been wasted if I just sit inside and read. I also don't watch TV at all, unless it is one AM or later.  I need to have my car looked at. It makes this rattling noise when I turn, and I hope it doesn't break down. I like that car, man. It's comfortable and gets good gas mileage.  Things I need to buy:  Tsunami Bomb - "The Great Escape"  Bad Religion - "The Empire Strikes First" Full tank of Gas I think that is a reasonable amount to spend, without being broke until next paycheck like I was this week.  I'll play your quotes game (I just quickly guessed): "If man did not have worries, he would not be man. Worries are the foundation of humanity." Thinker "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it." Houleism "The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule." Ehhh, Houleism "Beyond that frontier lay another. And beyond this lays yet another, and another. There will always be frontier, though it may change in appearance and temperament, for mankind to seek." Heinlein "Our country was founded on a distrust of government. Our founding fathers gave power to the people to keep an eye on government. So when politicians say, Trust me, they're actually being very un-American." Noam Chomsky "He who trusts all falls victim to men; he who trusts none falls victim to himself." Thinker "Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters." Houleism  For tomorrow after work: Clean and wash my car, and clean my room.   Oh, right, awards. Uhh.....What do I give awards out for? Casualties Army for Life: Chris Sellouts: Erik, John Most likely to succeed: Houley Most likely to be a burned out mess, living in a van down by the river and yelling nonsense: Tay Lord of Boring: Hawkeye M.I.A. this summer: Jefe Facists: Hobe, Schilling, Tay, Bailey Favorite Summer Pastime: Jammin' Worst Halo Player: Dustin Coolest House: Bryce Claims to bring the System down from the Inside: Fish Boy ....Who is really a: Corporate Whore Most likely to kill a friend: Realistically, Chris. He's most likely to kill  anything . In his defense, it will probably be an accident. But I think it is really John who is planning to off me.  Most like myself: ??? I don't know. Probably Chris. We're different, but not fundamentally different,  radically  different, like some others, and we believe in basically the same things.  Got some nonsensical calls today. I hate when people call me, and I don't understand what they're saying or what is going on or  anything . I also hate when people call me from strange numbers without voicemail. In my missed calls list, I counted 13 numbers which I do not know. The  13 mystery callers always call in the late morning, when I am asleep. You'd think they learn.  On that subject: Chris left me  five  voice messages the other day. None of them were even about anything important or relevant.  Buttons, man. Who thought of those?  Hobe remarked today that he thought of himself as a nerd because he played Halo every couple of weeks. I guess it is a negative thing to him. Halo is kind of like a group hierarchy thing, with people asserting their awesomeness through Halo. But I am kinda sick of playing 'lo now. After kicking Goat's ass, what do I have to prove? Maybe some of my other enemies will challenge me to a Halo match. Returning to the nerd thing, why does Hobe think it is a bad thing to be a nerd? I wouldn't mind being called a nerd, even though I don't think I am one. I hate math, hate science, hate Star Trek, and hate D+D. So, I don't know. Nerds have done cool things, though. Even though I will hate Weezer forever for birthing emo with their horrible  Pinkerton , I will love them forever for their sublime  Blue .  Blue  is one of those albums you can put on, and everyone in the car loves it and no one argues about what we are going to listen to for an hour or so. I swear that the bass line from  Only in Dreams  will be burned into my head forever.  But anyway, I bet Hobe doesn't know that the quickest way to an emo girl's heart is through being a nerd. Yeah, it works better even than listening to Dash and wearing a hankerchief in your back pocket. To be fair, according to m-w.com, using a hankerchief as a clothing accesory is a valid use of it, even though you probably will be hated by everyone forever. But hey, maybe Hobe knows that. Maybe he's trying to front himself as a so-called "nerd." Maybe I've been blogging for too long.  That above paragraph gave me a bad urge to listen to  Blue , and now I am.  Yeah, before Rivers surrounded himself with Asian women and started doing blow, he knew how to  rock . I just realized no one will understand that. I stand by it, anyway.  At mini-golf today, the River Rats next to the course were covering songs I liked. Anyway, one was  Say it Ain't So . Even misguided Misfits fans like Weezer.  I woke up at two today. Every morning, I vow that I will get up in ten more minutes, and it spirals out of control for hours.   Now that the blog has had a chance to grow a little, I'm glad I started it. It can be at times both sad and poignantly funny.  Poignantly  is an ambitious adverb to use, but I'm sure that  A day in the life of...  will live up to the hype. Heck, I've learned things about people I might have never learned, especially considering that I only pay half-attention to most people.  You know what I don't like? When songs break down into 7 minute jams. I used to think it was cool, but do we really need six minutes of Brad Nowell singing, "Down here at the pawn shop"?  My short-story comp is almost finished, and I'm looking down the barrel of no less than 4 novels. I've been having problems finishing books lately, something that almost never happens to me.   Well, this is about as long-winded as it goes. See ya tomorrow night.
