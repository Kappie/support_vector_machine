Now I shall gratefully accept all of the 'I told you so's and sit back and breathe my own contented sigh of relief.  Mo' money. Mo' vacation time. And to top it off, I can stay on at the hospital on a sort of "contract" basis. It's not really contracting, they call it 'pool' status which I guess means I join a pool of employees they can call on to do stuff. But I can transition in whomever takes over my job here, as well as carry on doing the 'outside of my job description' work I do for other departments like Powerpoint storyboards and newsletters etc. So I'll have a small secondary income which will be really nice.  Finally I can begin to dig out of the hole I'm in. It's a shallow hole, I don't have the huge amounts of debt hanging over me that some people have. I have no credit cards, mortgages or anything. I just have your basic, normal bills that somehow amounted to more than I earn currently and have been steadily piling up as I juggle them. But anyway, no more. I am not going to be going on any wild spending sprees now that I'll have a bit more cash flow but I may break down and buy myself a new crockpot :)  Anyway, that's my final update on this whole thing. I start in 2 weeks. I've given my notice here and now I have to clear out 4 years of accumulated crap out of my office. Wheeee!
