CQ seems like not wanting to do it, Kelvin dunnoe whether to do it or not. So, I think I am doing it at 9.  Yes. Okay. What happened yesterday? I honestly have no mood to recap. Oh yes!!! The most SHOCKING episode on AI yesterday! Can you believe it? Fantasia, LaToya and Jennifer are in the Bottom Three! Oh my god! What on earth was America thinking? Me and Amanda was aghast and shocked! The three best singers in the competition, and they are in Bottom 3? The judges and Ryan chastised America, telling them that AI is NOT a popularity contest! They have to vote for the best singer! What the heck? The one who went was Jennifer... Oh boy! Stupid decision America! You let a talent slipped through, you dorks! I heard quite a number of people dislike Fantasia because of her cockiness. Honestly! She has a great voice, and she has the right to be cocky lor! Me and Amanda honestly envisioned Fantasia and Jennifer in the Top 2, but now, it is impossible man! I do hope Fantasia makes it, becasue honestly, if she doesn't, there whole point of the show is gone. Fantasia should be at least in the top 2 (she can easily pull out a "Clay Aiken" if she doesn't win...seriously)! Go Fantasia! We are behind you!! Jia you!  Okay. Today was mooing. Ayioh!! I have no mood to blog le!! I am ultra distracted by a great Harry Potter fic!  OH NO!!! TaTa!   Okay. Obviously, I am back. Heh Heh. I came back from Survivor. Wow! Shii Ann did it! She won her first ever Immunity! She has beaten all odds and perservere! Shii Ann knew clearly she was about to go, but she's ain't going without a fight! When there is a will to stay, you can achieve anything! Shii ann proves that saying true today! Her strong determination to survive for another 3 days has granted her first-ever Immunity! Great! Bravo! Of course, I wouldn't be too sure of her departure status next week. If she loses Immunity, she's going. So, let's hope she wins! Okay...Alicia was voted out. Bad choice people! I like her frankness and her eloquence. She's a strong player. Stupid people! (Quoted from Shii Ann) You should have voted out Rob Mariano instead! Ayierr!! Useless!!  Okay. I go liao. See ya. TaTa!
