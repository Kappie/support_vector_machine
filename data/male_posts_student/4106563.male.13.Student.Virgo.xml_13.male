"Panty punk" is Avril Lavigne (or whatever her name is), Good Charolette (if you disagree, then fine), Ashlee Simpson, Blink 182 (again, if you disagree, fine), and other preppy, idiotic bands I forgot about. Panty punk are the bands who overdress, like getting those so-called "punk" clothes at malls, like paint or underliner going down their faces into a shaft (like a blade or something like that). In an article (in some magazine), Avril (the fuck her last name is spelled) quoted, "I'm , like, the Sid Vicious of this generation." (courtesy of God Save The Sex Pistols). The fuck you are! You're did a song for a fucking Disney movie soundtrack! The fuck you're punk! The fuck you're the "Sid Vicious of this generation"!  Here are the punk bands who aren't pussies: Green Day Ramones Sex Pistols Dead Milkmen The Clash Velvet Underground The Damned The Misfits And every old punk band from the 70's - the 90's.
