But we get one step closer each and everyday, And we'll figure it out on the way. -Lizzie Maguire, "The Lizze Maguire Theme"   the first day back from break was amazing. it made me realize how much fun school had become. we worked more on our research reports and fam. tree projects, and english was fully devoted to romeo and juliet.  on monday we got a pysco bomb threat and they came in to shonicks class (A3) and they were like "kitty" or thats what chris remembers hearing. and then on tuesday (the day of the first fight of the week) we found out there was a bomb threat. bleh. it was some shitty teens who were trying to rob a bank and like i dunno.. it was in the paper.. i guess i shoulda read it..  wednesday (i think) was lisa's birthday and her, kate, emily and tessas dropped into the library during my break. we sat around and talked and lisa had this HOTT shirt that tess made! jorden stopped by too. oo yeah, since they ditched they all had fake names.  lisa- marie porter jorden- nathalie green tess- elizabeth kate- can't remember..  it was awesome. the history homework had been lightened because Mr. Shonick wanted us to devote time to our research reports. the next day, in english, we performed the opening to romeo and juliet. chris was tybalt and i played benvolio and that BITCH STABBED ME!! i think my dagger was defective... but i got him back, in the begininng ot the party i was capulet and he was tybalt again and i hit him in the back of the head for wanting to kill romeo. freak. kidding~ chris hastings is the coolest. alyssa was romeo tho! shes sooooo skinny.. and lisa was juliet...  on friday i went to math as always, at 7:40, then i had my open so i went into the library and had to sit thru the dancers dancing. bleh. eric watson was in there... and a bunch of girls.. LIKE THE MISSING ONE!! oh yeah, this chick went missin on wednesday and there were 2 more fights that week... so i wrote nathalie a 10 page note which took the whole entire period...  well anyway, after my break i skipped PE cause i really didnt feel good so i went with christina (who has an open B3) and so we walked around soquel village in the rain. she shared a bunch of personal stories with me and i shared some with her.. it was a bonding experience. we went to this like "Lion Park" and there was rain and stuff.. and we went to this yoga place and i almost died laughing!! it was great! then we went to the baglery and ate and we started walking back to school so i could get my camera (not that i had anyone to ake pictures of at harbor!! bleh!!) and we saw christina's mom and so we went to try and get crystal and nathalie outta class but they wouldnt come... so christina and i got my shirt and my camera from my locker.. and then stopped my longoria's room to wave at katy, matt, carson and chris... oo i think alec was in there too...  well we got in christina's car and drove to harbor. the bell hadn't rung yet so we decided to go walk down to the bus stop to check the times but then we got to mud and i was like "nuh uh!" and so we walked back up to the school and we talked with matt and tina and elena and fidel and NAOMI BRADFORD!! she is my harbor lover! i swear, if it wasnt for her i would have tottally had a shitty time. but yeah..  while naomi was off somewhere i was talking with elena jin and nathalie called so we went to go find her and steve saw me and he was like "BEN! BEN!" and i thought he was talking to me but i guess not! cause im not BEN! SORRY STEVE! :-(  with crystal + nathalie there it was a hell of a lot funner! christina and nathalie and crystal and i tottally shined! it was awesome! i would do it all again.. except i would've looked for jaye.. and maybe talked to michael and tell chris albrect (dominic's butt buddy) that i wasn't gonna beat him up.. ha thats funny...  so the bell rang and i went up to tina and hugged her for like a minute and she was like "get off me!" and then we started to walk down to the bus stop. it was shitty and muddy and i called jack vidnovic to try and get a ride but he had already left. stupid A days.. we got down to the bus stop right as the bus pulled away. "oh well, only 15 min." we thought. so we sat. and waited. and there was still no bus. so we sat and tapped our thrid eyes like that chick from Rich Girls. and STILL NO BUS CAME! so we were just about to start walking when this bus came around the corner and we all got on and paid money. i sat with christina and across from us sat nathalie and crystal. this girl new gabi, nathalie's cousin, and she talked to us for a little bit.  we decided on that bus ride that the next time we went to harbor we would PLAN IT OUT waaay ahead of time!  that weekend i got some early christmas presents like NOW 14!!! its a great CD!! luken is the awesomest!! and on saturday i drove up to SF with Andrew Galvez and his two friends, Kathy and Veronica. it was cool! and we went shopping EVERYWHERE!!  banana republic, urban outfitters, abercrombie, american eagle, victoria's secrets, fcuk, macys (OO IT WAS SOOOO FUCKING PRETTY!!), and i acctually think that was it.. hmm.. mebbe there was more... there were a lotta gay guys! and it was super fun cause andrew was there and he bought me in the zone and i bought myself the missy elliot CD. it was one of the BEST days of my life!!  on monday it was a pretty normal C day.. until english. our counselors came in and talked to us about college. i had a lotta questions and so fromnow on when anyone asks "any questions?" chris turns to me and says "brandon?"... yeah.. we also got our schedule options for next semester, but i didnt wanna change anything... well the whole talk was really exciting... it really opened my eyes and that night i searched online for college resources and academic standards.. and i was talking to JACK about it and he said that i didnt EVER come across as the INTELLECTUAL type! psh!! i guess its true then, he REALLY doesnt noe me!!  on tuesday and wednesday i was in full college over achiever mode. i asked questions (like chris knew i would) in all my classes and my french teacher said i was too much of an acheiver and that i would prolly end up killing someone one day. :-D oo i also met micheal over the phone monday and he was pretty awesome. thanks for transferring my calls dominic! even if you did have a shitty weekend and got drunk without me FOR THE SECOND TIME i still love you.. except not. on wednesday i even went to a french club meeting!! it was sooo cool!! we're having a french club party in january and spencers house! spencer the guy, not the girl!! he's soooo hott! tess and tiana and nathalie and naomi and kate are gonna be there too!! its sooo cool!  thursday was rainy. i dont like the rain. but at the same time i love it. we traded rough drafts in shonick and everyone who read mine said that it was good but no one could give me feedback. blah... that day after school while ellen and i were waiting for our ride, i danced with annie under the eaves and then hannah and i talked about starting a club.. lol we came up with funky names.. it was hilarious!! but then my dad came so we left~  friday was boring. nothing fun happened EXCEPT I BEAT hannah and elizabeth and emila and ivy in knock out! hahaha! can't touch this! it was really fun! but yeah when i got home i worked hard on my report and thats basically what i did all weekend.. i slept a lot on sunday and i finished my french family tree project that day... and on saturday (with help from juntado) i started THIS BLOG~!! and on saturday i also watched BUFFY SEASON FIVE~ HELL YEAH IT KICKED ASS! i cried at the end of "The Body" but, of course, dominic was there to kinda cheer me up.  monday i brought my family tree project. we worked more on rough drafts in shonick and thankfully it was so short tat we didnt work THAT long... bleh~ monday was lame.  tuesday was better. we had a sub in math and we did book work the whole period... it was easy and i finished early so i wrote a note to nathalie. piano was awesome and i passed a bunch of songs and got my grade up to a B.. all i have to do is pass 3 more songs and i get an A!! we played this really fun game and i was on a team with the lockewood sisters and ellen and angelica and umm... some other people who are REALLY cool but i dont noe their names.
