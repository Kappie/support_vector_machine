A few things have dates almost set in stone, such as:  June 22, Last Exam June 28, Federal Election July 3, Hold Garage Sale July 31, Family Reunion in MB Aug 23, CHER Concert  And a few things that are relocatable, such as:  July 27, 28, 29, or 30, Fly to Manitoba 1-2 Weeks, Unscheduled Time Slot, Granddad and Grandma's House At least 1 week in Manitoba, may be 2, starting anywhere from July 27.  So an interesting summer all around! I have a lot of stuff going on.......It appears ever clearer that I need a job. Not a conventional job, more of "odd jobs" whether it be computer repairs or babysitting. Something I can turn down once in a while. And somewhere in this time I hope to lose 10-40 lbs...Think of me, 40lbs lighter......I would look a lot better, dats fa sure! Oh well, c'est la vie. Whatever will happen will happen...  And a last little blurb.....If you have bad shoes, DO NOT WALK OVER 10 MINUTES.....I walked to Lime Ridge today and I have a blister! OUCH it hurts when it hits something.....Oh well. Goodnights everyones. Lets not lose touch over the summer. You can always call me at (905)-574-3429. And if I likes ya, I will give you the phone number of my upcoming destinations. Also, lets not forget y'all can visit me! 66-55 Towercrest Drive....Feel Free, but try to call first, as I might be out-of-province, out-of-city, or just running (ahem, bussing/sitting) about Hamilton.  Lotza Love (heeheehee), Bobert G.  P.S., Tanya, I love the idea of a picnic......Just watch out for Yogi Bear!....Now im the UberNerd...lol...
