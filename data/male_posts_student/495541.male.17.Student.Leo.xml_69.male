Maybe I’m speaking only for myself because I haven’t gotten much sleep lately.  Overall, I’d say that I haven’t gotten out of the summer groove yet.  School doesn’t seem the same.  That may sound odd, but it’s hard to explain.  I remember being able to remember everything I did in a day at school.  Now I can’t.  Remembering homework assignments is harder as well.  I used to be able to go without having to write them down.  Most of my classes are going fine.  I’m not really working hard at school so far, honestly.  Lack of interest being the most probable cause.  I suppose that should change.  It will.  Nothing much more to say, as it always seems.  It’s late again.  Good night.
