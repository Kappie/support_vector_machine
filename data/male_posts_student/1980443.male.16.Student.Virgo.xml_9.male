Hmmm, well I love my family and it's important to me.  I'm also in society and it's also pretty important.  Putting these two together won't be too hard.  I'll sum it up in about one or two sentences.  If people would depend on their family more in society and have better relationships with them, than I'm sure alot of different, bad things wouldn't happen.  More time with family means more care and love for those who need it.  Our society isn't always "nice" ya know?  Like I think of the Japenese people, and they have a tremendous reliance on family.  They're always really nice to everyone!  They share there proverbs, their rice, even give their daughters to marry someone before they're born!  Wow, we need more importance on family in our society.  Thanks yous  That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
