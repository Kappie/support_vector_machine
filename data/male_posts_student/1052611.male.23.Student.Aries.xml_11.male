If you have been there and can give me some fundaes (we can never give up IIT lingo, can we?).. that would be great!  What are the places around that one can see? I've checked a few things on the net, but a first-hand idea would probably be better.  Anyone in Delhi willing to take a break and visit Dalhousie?
