Nick got lost, and we had to look for him, the lines were too long, and I ran into Ted. No further explanation necessary.   Now at the hotel, the chef clearly knew that his contract said he cooks for 88 people. There were 133 of us. Mr. Barr got angry, to say the least. Nick got a major migraine (probably from Ted), so he didn't swim w/ us. He didn't miss much.   On Sunday, Mr. Barr said we had to get a '1' rating or higher when we perform. I felt really bad after knowing that because of all the (censored) (censored) (censored) (censored) (censored) freaks who don't give a (censored) about how we (censored) sound, we got a '2' rating. NONE of Mr. Barr's groups had ever gotten below a '1'. I was cheered up with short lines and Mr. Barr going on the Rip-Cord. His hair was blowing everywhere. Pichler and Swank payed. Lucky Mr. Barr.
