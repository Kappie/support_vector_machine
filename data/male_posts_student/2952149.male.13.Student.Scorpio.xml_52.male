She asked the guys first what we liked in a girl but we only said like five things. I think we said personality, a sence of humor, all the rappers said big butts and me and Tim were like "WTF thats kinda weird." lol. Then Tien was like "BIG TITS!!!" Then she was like "You have to be respectful, you should say big breasts, not tits." *lmao* Then the girls said like twenty things and I aint kidding. Over the weekend I did nothing woeth telling, well...hehe...jk lol. Today in 1st period we watched this gay video from the eighties that we already watched a long time ago about peer pressure or some crap like that. In Moser we started German. I really like that language but I don't know why. So my guitar concert recital thing is in two days but it is going to be during !st period so that totally blows big time because now Stacey probably won't be able to come. Shit! I just found out Stacey's parents sold her guitar. I was going to get her a going-away gift that had to do with guitar but now I guess I will have to think of something else...oh wait, Stacey you are probably reading this....oh well w/e.
