As I think we all know we did not actually elect him in 2000 based on the popular vote which I think most people can agree would be the best system now that the masses are well educated. Beyond this I do not want rehash and squabbles left over from four years ago. Although I was only twelve at the time I was very much involved in politics which is hard for many people to take seriously as I am sure my present age is as well but despite of that it's true I was very interested in politics. I remember I was pro-Bradley in the primaries and really after those I didn't care as long as Bush didn't get elected. In my naive ways I thought because most of my friends who knew little about politics wanted Gore to win it was a done deal. I was very much upset when Bush did win and I think it was in those following months around age thirteen that I realized that I was in fact a democrat. Before I just wanted who ever I liked (in a political sense) to win. Now I did not inherit my parents opinions in case your wondering as is often the case at my age, my mother has voted socialist in the past and most recently has been a proponent of Nader but will probably vote Kerry this year only for the sake of keeping Bush away from another four years, my father also is anti-Bush although hardly vocal on the subject. I would most likely describe my father as a liberal Republican despite this. It's hard to tell since he rarely talks about it. Now back to the point. In my opinion the reasons not to reelect Bush are of much more importance then exactly where in Indochina Kerry was in on December 24th, 1968. People talk about questions of integrity and I ask you where exactly are the weapons of mass destruction. If you are of the opinion that it was an intelligence failure and that in fact it was not at all Bush's fault you must not forget exactly who had the say so in going to war. The facts were before Bush and exactly what those facts were are still up to debate but we know he chose to go to war, that choice, should, whether or not you think it is fair, be one of the major deciding factors in how you will cast your ballot. He made the wrong choice and we now have 1,000 dead American boys, many teenagers, many opposed and the unspoken of thousands wounded, so many of which are missing legs, arms and living day-by-day on machines. What do we have to show for their pain and suffering? A freer but more dangerous country? Is it worth it when you consider Libya, Syria, Iran, North Korea, China, the many African and South American countries and others under siege from terrorists like Indonesia, Philippines, Spain, Russia and so on. If we are in this business to do the right thing then why are we not in those countries or does freedom carry no more then a 1,000 body bag price tag? And don't let the failures of Iraq and inability to capture Saddam Hussein distract the so willingly distracted public from the failings here at home. So far his tax cuts, while it was nice I think for everyone to get some money back a couple years ago, have done little to boost the economy. You can blame it on the Clinton administration but the facts are that the effects of the economy don't take four years to be seen. The Clinton administration was the most successful wars and civil rights aside since the creation of the United States. This is a fact, you can look up the numbers, it is not because of Bush or Reagan, it is not that the Republicans can claim economic success for whoever they feel like. Again we have been left high and dry as Bush's job growth projections fall dreadfully short and the poor are still just as poor and with less jobs. As for the outsourcing of jobs Bush cannot be blamed, but he can be blamed for taking no action. It is time that we ask ourselves exactly what has he done in the four years he's had. I'm not going to tell you that Bush is behind the shameless Swift Boat Veterans For Truth adds anymore then I would believe Kerry is behind Moveon.org's adds and neither am I a proponent for the 527 adds coming off the air. It is called freedom of speech and I love it. It has taken a most disturbing turn for the worse in recent years with the Patriot Act, a step closer to Nazi Germany and the nationalism it embraced, a small step granted but a step none the least. Back to the 527 adds I do believe that there is some investigation due into Bush's record. It came up in the last election and in the four or five years it's been since it was brought up Bush has failed to bring up a single bit of evidence suggesting he was there during the time of his reported AOL. Kerry has been defending his own record valiantly as well as people who served with him, not registered Republicans that were only in-country at the same time as him. I would like to see Bush defend himself, not because I am at all sure he can't but because I think that if he has nothing to hide he should (by the way I also agree that Kerry should release his entire record, although he has already released about half of it). I think there is enough questions about Bush to keep everyone going for a long time. And his dodging of these questions makes me unable to watch much of his few press conference now. I was watching the one today and once again he did not specifically denounce the Swift Boat Veterans For Truth though John McCain (whom I have a great deal of respect for as a politician, person and veteran) denounced them having taking flak from them during his own primaries in 2000. So when you vote in November remember to consider four more years of recession, fighting and limiting of freedoms under the guise of terrorism control, a issue that is often talked about and rarely acted on.
