You have two options. 1) you could just keep your mouth shut and just live with it. This way you don't have to worry about rejection or anything, and the relationship will never change. BUT you also have to live with the fact that the relationship will never progress OR 2) You could ask, and it could work out.  BUT it could not work out, and now you're stuck with this awkward situation where you both know, and the friendship is never the same. its a gamble that all I can say  and I'm stuck in that situation now
