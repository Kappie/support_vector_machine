I’ve noticed that since I’m the first thing Lisa sees when she comes through the door, she has a big scowl on her face until she sees Candace. No more mornings for me for a while, which means no more Café 201 for breakfast.  I actually wrote like a page today.  I went out to eat with the family… lobster, fish, fried tofu, veggies, fried bread, beef, more veggies.  I’m looking forward to going to the Getty this week. I haven’t been there in like 2 years? I went to LACMA more because of my membership… but yea… the Getty is cool. They have a big thing on Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in addition to their cool permanent collection. Another reason it’ll be cool is I get to hang out with Crystal. She seems like a smart girl, who’s got good taste in music and likes art. She should make for some company on the little trip to the Getty.  It’ll be the movies with the Cambridge Crew aka the female posse Friday.  Tomb Raider ? I’d rather see  Bad Boys , but whatever is good.  Work on Saturday… I hope Pat doesn’t come in.  Maybe some ‘rasslin with the boys Sunday.  Been listening to the Unseen, Pistol Grip, and T(I)NC lately.  ***
