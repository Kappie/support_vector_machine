I spent about 4hrs sitting at Burger King at Holland today. I slept, thought, moped, cried and left. We stood together, you and I, in front of the glass in the quiet cold with soft elevator-like music playing. On the other side were lovebirds. Close warm secure. I closed my eyes and felt for you hand again, but you were not there.  I'm loosing what I was. My friends tell me to my face that they want the old Tim back. The one who smiled and laughed and made them laugh. "now THAT was Tim!" they said. I looked down and smiled. I want him back too.  Remember how songs fit your life when you want them to? Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday. Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be. There's a shadow hanging over me. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play, now I need a place to hide away,  Oh, I believe in yesterday.
