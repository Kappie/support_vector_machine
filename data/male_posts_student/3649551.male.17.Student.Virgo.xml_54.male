That'd be awesome, if every time I posted some worthless rant I slipped further into the clutches of insanity. And then when people started to wonder, "What went wrong with that kid?" they could just get online and say, "Oh." The funny thing about this is that once I start posting something, I just follow my thought process and write everything down. New post, new post, new post, okay, done. I mean, these posts may be pointless, but it's good practice at not censoring what I say. Like right now, if I was honest, I would write that I'm thinking about that green eyed girl. Not in a creepy, horny, eyes-glazed-over kind of way, but just in the screensaver of my mind. Like commercials to my scheduled thoughts. It's hot in this house. Why is there a spoon in the bathroom? I'm hungry.
