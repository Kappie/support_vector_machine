First lesson was Digital Media and Design e-Learning, which was boring so we shall skip to lunch.  We pondered for a while before deciding to eat at the North Canteen, which was way over at the other end of campus. We had 2 hours anyway so it didn't matter. After lunch, we went to sit around the koi pond, basically to just talk cock and waste time. Then, 15 minutes before our next lesson, Electronics Fundamentals, Derrick decided to play around and his MP3 player fell into the koi pond. (Song Bo moment :-) ) We were a bit surprised and amused, but soon we asked an attendant to help and he brought a net for us to fish the MP3 player out. It was probably useless by then...  During EF, we had a practical test. It was not as easy as we had thought. Many of us did not know how to do. Most of us cheated by asking the brighter ones in the class. Most of us probably failed it anyway, so might as well cheat.  Next was DMD practical. Another test! This time, it was about Macromedia Flash, or how to do animation. Was not too difficult anyway. I got 100 marks! Actually, my creation was quite anyhow, but it was marked on whether you knew how to do anyway, not the final creation. I prefer to think of my finished product as "funky".  After which, we went to Ang Mo Kio for dinner (Some of us anyway). We went to Long John Silver and basically sat around, ate and talk cock. After which, we headed for home. OK, not really interesting, but I was quite tired by then. It was a long day. Thankfully, tomorrow has only 3 hours of lesson (8 to 11am), or 2 hours for those who  jia boh  the first lesson. Still, it's a short day, and hopefully just as interesting.
