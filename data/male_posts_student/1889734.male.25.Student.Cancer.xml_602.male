However, the other team was extremely fast and skilled as well.  I also watched the game before mine, and those teams were fast and skilled.  I've been placed in Division I, so the vast majority of skaters are quite advanced.  Honestly, I've only seen hockey this well played a handful of times in my in-line 'career', and I'm going to be VERY busy.  This is a good thing, and I'm looking forward to playing at this level.  I played well, but poorly at the same time.  There were quite a few occasions where I got a piece of the puck, but it went in anyway.  I felt good about reading the play and being in the right place, but my execution wasn't as good as it should be.  I have a history of playing poorly in the first game of a season, so we'll see if I improve.  And yes, I'm avoiding telling you the score....  We won, 13-11.  Yes, 11!!!  You shouldn't give up 11 goals and win.  I was mortified, but my team didn't seem to be troubled by it.  I think there was a least 6 goals I SHOULD have stopped, the rest were difficult situations that would be goals at least 60% of the time.  The puck just kept squeezing by me, even though I'd get a piece.  And these guys can shoot!  Everyone seemed like they had a heavy shot with pinpoint accuracy.  That's probably why they kept going in - they had so much force, I couldn't seem to deflect them even when I got a piece.  So, I'm embarrased, but happy we won.
