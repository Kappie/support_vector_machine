Pow...zoom...I can't remember the connection here being so fast. Also since Matt isn't here today, his laptop is sucking the bandwidth out of the network while he downloads the lastest Aqua Teen Hunger Force episodes.....not that I don't like to watch them when he's here!   School starts tomorrow. I am glad I checked my schedule....and then rechecked it again. It looks pretty sweet for me. I will be out at 9:30am 2 days a week and at noon the other 2 days leaving me with Friday off. I still have to come to "work" but hey I will live!  Thinking about book writing and web building. I just wish I had the time to read and learn all the stuff that I want to learn about instead of what a school say I should learn! I think I am better at self teaching...at least about the subjects I care about. Math is a subject I don't care about.
