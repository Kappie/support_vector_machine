And it turns out I've been attracting a bunch of losers looking for Cobain quotes to this site. Heh, I've spun a web, and caught my prey.  A few more than expected too. Actually, I didn't expect this at all, I didn't even know it was possible.  There's a way to be horrendously offensive, and its the most effective way to see the most hilarious expressions in other people's faces.  There's been a bit of a bug goin' around in our group that's been making us moody, or some shit. Glad to see Dollface's cured, but for some reason, I had some of its effects too. And here I was thinking I'm the one to be immune. I guess I'm just as human as the rest of you, and that's an odd feeling to realize...  I'm Deadinside, and you better not catch me on one of my bad days...in other words, any day...  "Spun into hell, devouring the souls of my victims. How could I damn you too? I thought I'd never lose my love"
