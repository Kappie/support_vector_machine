The rating is from 1 to 5 and is based on the following:   Cleanliness Comfort Acoustics Power Flush *Foot Traffic* (Rolin's addition) General Impression   All ratings should be completed using the handicapped stall.  If there is no handicapped stall, a perfect 5 is not possible.   In general, a rating is established by rating each criteria and taking the average.  However, the system is meant to be more subjective.  Ultimately, it is up to the reviewer to decide the weight of each criteria.  For example, if a bathroom is a 4 in Cleanliness, Comfort and Acoustics, but a 1 in Power flush, the average would result in a score of 3 (all decimals are dropped).  The reviewer could make a judgment call and still award a 4 to the bathroom in question.   The general impression category is used for other items not included in the other criteria.  Some things falling under this category include: Urinal Mints (quality, aroma), Auto Flush/Sink/Hand Dryers (a complete absence of paper towels combined with a weak hand dryer is a definite negative), Lighting (too bright or too dark are both negative), etc.   This should provide a good backbone for any bathroom related research to be completed.  Any questions can be directed to myself or Dr. Young.  (that's Doctor of Commodology)   Note: The only perfect 5 to date is the Fourth floor of the Biochemistry Research Building at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.  A facility so nice, it was worth walking from Pomfret just to take a dump.   Any perfect 5 must be confirmed by myself or Daniel to be legitimate.   Thank you for your attention, Dr. Dan Wearsch, C.D.
