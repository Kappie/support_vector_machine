My sink started working again, I went for a walk through a natural preserve area to get to campus, saw lots of squirrels and deer, and had a good dinner. The only bad part was my refrigerator froze my eggs. It wasn't just a loss of a dozen eggs, but it's kind of a pain getting eggs home via the bus.  I'm bored so I'm installing Fallout 2 on my comp. I hope this cheapo burned copy works alright. If not, I can always pay Target or Walmart a visit.  Class starts tomorrow... with a 7 - 10 PM class! Lovely huh? Well I guess it being so late in the day gives me a chance to do stuff like go get more juice and stuff at Walmart.  ***
