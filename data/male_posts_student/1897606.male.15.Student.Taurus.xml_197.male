Jesse B. Muckenfuss, 37, of Woodbridge is charged with attempted breaking and entering, malicious wounding, driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, refusal to take a breath test and driving on a suspended license.  According to sheriff's Maj. David Decatur, the woman let an acquaintance come to her Quarry Road home after he called about 3 a.m. Sunday and said he needed to talk to her about something. They are not romantically involved, Decatur said.  Shortly after the woman answered a knock on her door, the man slapped her across the face and accused her of saying bad things about him, Decatur said.  The woman told police she had no idea what the man was talking about. He pulled out a pellet gun and struck the woman in the head several times with it, Decatur said, then hit her arms and legs with a regulation-sized hockey stick.  Eventually the man got inside the injured woman's home, where he forced her to prepare him a meal.  Decatur said the man proceeded to play "mind games" with the victim, telling her that he was high on crack cocaine and not sure what he might do next. He also brandished a steak knife toward the victim as he ate the meal she'd fixed, Decatur said.  Police said the woman tricked the man into stepping outside to smoke a cigarette, then slammed the door behind him and ran to press a panic alarm in her home.  The man banged on her door with the hockey stick for several minutes before leaving, Decatur said.  Deputy C.P. Roach spotted the suspect's vehicle on Quarry Road and stopped him. He later found the pellet gun and the hockey stick outside the victim's home.  Decatur said the victim had visible injuries, including what appeared to be a couple of broken fingers.  Muckenfuss was placed in the Rappahannock Regional Jail.
