On our lunch break we went on a stroll around the shopping centre and I bumped into the woman who plays Shelley's mum in Coronation Street, so that was pretty cool. Then we went on more random strolls and did more doodles and stuff, and I noticed this girl kept grinning at me everytime I looked back at her. I thought something was up with her at first!She came over to me a while later, apologising incase she scared me,asking me my name and stuff, telling me the reason she was grinning is because she thought I 'looked cute'... yeah right! She seemed quite sweet really. She was only 14 though, but she looked about 20! Anyway, we exchanged numbers because she doesn't have many friends around here yet, so I thought I'd help her out.After that, wewent over to the War Museum and went in a pretty scary elevator that went up at least a mile, and had thin caging to walk on when you reached the top, so you could see right underneath you... pretty scary! Then after the gallery I went into town to meet some friends (Laura and Charlie), and it was so funny! I thought it would be quiteawkward seen as I got off with them both only last week but things went smoothly! They doused me in tattoo's with permanent marker, but it's all good. I got free Skittles and free chips out of them though. So I win...
