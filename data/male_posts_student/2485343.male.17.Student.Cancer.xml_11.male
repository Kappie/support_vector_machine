Just a meager 'hi' in the hallways. I find myself to be mercifully weak when it comes to girls, I love them and have so much respect for them, they just scare me to the point where I feel a fear of rejection. Maybe im just not one for the ladies, you know what I mean? Maybe if I were to sit down with her, I can actually connect with her deeper than I have been able to in the past. I liked her so much, and I have to admit, I still do. I cant let her go for some reason, I have been able to let go of a lot of girls in the past, but I cant let her go. I don't want to let her go, and that is the problem. It hurt me so badly, my metaphorical wall has been broken for the first time and I cant pick up the pieces, they are destroyed beyond recognition. I yearn to feel the touch of her hand in mine, I want to feel her lips on mine again. I want for her to look in my eyes again and see her smile and kiss me, I want to see the smile on her face when I look into her eyes. I still smell her watermelon lipgloss she had on when I first kissed her, her first kiss, my first real kiss. I cherish that. I want to go back to the day at cacey's house. The day where she looked so beautiful, the day we kissed for the first time, I want her to go back with me, I can relive that day in my mind over and over again, so surreal. I want to feel her in my arms again. I want to make the ceilings look like floors, I want to talk about the striped hair-tie. 'is it yellow with black stripes?' maybe I would like her to tell me why she left. Why she cant be with me now, why she couldn't make us work. Most of all, I just want her to look me in the eyes again.
