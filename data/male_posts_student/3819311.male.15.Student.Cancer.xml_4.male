Today, Singapore’s only preserved coastal fort still stands as an important window to our colonial past and a poignant reminder of the war years. Life-sized replicas, interactive exhibits and even authentic aromas are lovingly recreated – from the smells of detergent in the Laundry Room to the whiffs of sizzling bacon in the Cook House.   The historical landmark also provides the perfect backdrop to the permanent exhibition, ‘A Soldier Remembers – The History of Blakang Mati’. Visitors can browse through more than 245 photographs, documents and film clips on display. When ‘class’ is over, head out into the sunshine and examine actual 17th century guns and cannons, or explore the old tunnels and scare yourself silly.  taken from:  http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_fort.htm
