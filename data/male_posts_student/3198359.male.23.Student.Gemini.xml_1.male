Is this the start of a new direction for Microsoft? does it mean the days of "screw the customer out of ever dime plus leave a bill for the next generation", hardly, now that would have been a major change in direction.  What we are seeing now isn't necessarily a change but a realisation that no matter how they improve their product, they'll always find that there will be a significant number of people who will prefer to run Linux or a UNIX of some sort, ahead of using Windows for the servers and/or workstations.  With this realisation, they've (although not openly) conceded that the best way to extract money from these customers is by offering the ability for the competitors to license technologies off them and payment being made back via royalties either via once up payment or a "per-unit" royalty which is generally the case in most business transactions.   What this will allow them to do is allow their recurring revenue increase thus allow them to eventually start paying sizable dividends to their shareholders, however, the other side is this, they're a pragmatic company. No matter how much the fanboys from the anti-Microsoft camp would love to make out, Microsoft isn't stupid. They realise that they can either try and fight Linux/UNIX and waste their energy trying to get the last 60% of the marketplace (server marketplace) or they can simply say, "hey, they've chosen that, lets offer our technologies so they can run them on their chosen platform".  Microsoft benefits either way, whether it be the Linux/UNIX market expanding or the Windows marketing expanding, the fact remains, they'll make money indirectly by providing technologies rather than openly selling software which would give the market the incorrect perception that Microsoft has "thrown in the towel" in regards to competing.
