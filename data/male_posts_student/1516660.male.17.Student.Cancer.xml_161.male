Actually, CQ asked me out to the library to study today. But as Wendy's tutor, I asked Wendy if she needed me for tuition. She said no. But I go library also do nothing one. Wendy said "might as well come over play PS". So I took her word for it. HaHa!   Okies, I woke up at 8.30 (I think...I never looked at the clock like I usually did). I bathed and went online to wait for my mom to get breakfast (chee cheong fun....the store didn't open, so I ate roti prata instead). After that, Mom came back and I ate breakfast.  After breakfast, I went on to rename all my mp3s. The Artist/Title is so inapporpriately named sometimes! Ergh! It took me about 1.5hours of hard work and opening of every single file to name all my mp3s! YaY! I am so proud of myself! Meo-ow! After that, I went to eat lunch (instant noodles).  In the middle of eating lunch, Wendy smsed. She had no money to buy a new keyboard and speakers. Her keyboard spoilt. Okay, not really. The space bar won't work. So, whatevershetypesturnsoutlikethis (okay.not.really.she.found.a.way.to.space). The speakers are spoiling. Yeah. I offered to pay her back what I owed her ($6.75...rounding up to $6.80). I am going over, so I can pay ma. I arranged to meet at Admiralty, so she can go change her foreign money (US notes) to get some money to buy her stuff.   On the way, I realized that I didn't do the Physics June Paper! I was aghast! I was shocked! I can't believed I forgot! I called my friends to check. Ah Ji and Wendy confirmed got, but they are not doing. Oh my!! I am so dead!  We met at Admiralty, but our efforts proved furtile. The person refused to change US$1 notes, so Wendy have to go back to her $20 note. However, we brought Wendy's keyboard (some girls were complaining, because we snatched the last one of its kind, i.e., the cheapest one. HaHaHa!) at Popular. We walked back to her house. She installed the keyboard and it worked. She's going to Admiralty to exchange her notes and buy speakers. I am gonna be left alone at her house to do my Physics homework (which I lent her to copy later, since I copied her MCQs). Well, I managed to complete majority of the questions by the time she came back with speakers, notebook, foolscap and forgot what else.  After that, I played my FFIX game. Oh yeah. I reached Oeilvert...but after a tiresome walk. The monsters there are so powerful, and I am like, so 25-ish+ levels. Oh my! I hate Armstrong, and also the Cactuars, even though they give plenty of experience and money. At Oeilvert, i spent all my money on weapons!!! Oh my! I am such a qiong guang dan! I saved the game, and then played Chocobo Racing.  Wendy and I first practised racing. HaHaHa! She was quite pathetic. Ayiah, it's okay to be pathetic for your first game. She don't know how to use the "X" for braking, and don't even know she have stones to throw (and abilities to activate too). She was too concentrated on racing! HaHa! The real strat for this game is to use the apporpirate ability, character. You also have to pay close attention to the stones you recieved and use them wisely with any given opportunity (and also match them with your ability). And of course, pay attention to the race course and how to manovere around it. So many things to do. It trains your multi-tasking skills. Ha! No wonder Wendy can't get the hang of it. But she is slowly getting it. We played Grand Prix twice. I got 4th on the 1st race (big drop in skills wor!), but I got a perfect score of 36 in the second race (YaY!). Wendy improved from 5th to 4th. That's an improvement. Then, she played Story Mode. She got stuck in the Black Manor, racing against Black Mage. Oh my! Even I couldn't win either! So many twists and turns! Cannot blame me ma! I left at 6, leaving Wendy to play the Story Mode. Ha! She's real determined to win Black Manor! Pei fu, pei fu!  Okay, reached home, ate, watched TV (Holland V, First Touch and Brainest Kid) and came online. I gotta end le this entry le. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog!
