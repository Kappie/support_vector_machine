Saturday    Got up at 5:30AM, no idea how and when I got on the coach, but I did, and we set off for the border...  At about 10 we get to Rainbow Bridge, the main crossing point at Niagara Falls, waited for a bit on the bridge for the coaches in from to get processed by Immigration and when the rather surly policewoman finished checking our papers, (my British passport got a raised eyebrow), we set off for the first stop, Boston.. Well, after another rather surly (Anyone spot a pattern here?) policeman told the driver "to get a move on"  Boston came, after about 9 hours, and we did a tour of Harvard. That was rather amusing, since they had a statue of Harvard himself, (even though they had no idea what he looked like), the wrong date for the founding of the school, (1638 instead the actual 1636), and had some completely random person added to the list of founders...:/  After this it was about 8:30, so we got to the hotel, dumped various things, and looked for somewhere for dinner. Nearby was Quincey Market, with its multitudes of fast food places and shops. More interesting was the guy doing comedy outside. He wasn't bad, although the most amusing part was when he performed the "sexy trick", which he claimed "everytime I've done this trick someone from the audience comes up and kisses me" Yep, sure enough, after his first failed attempt a woman from the crowd comes up and kisses him,  but  when he succeeds the second time, four men come up in succession to kiss him, more disturbingly, a 5 year old also went up...  Well, after that my view of Americans went on a rollercoaster ride, the people at Immigration don't exactly push themselves to the top of my Christmas card list, but I suppose the new national sport of the USA is currently paranoia... some decent comedians though I suppose...:/   Sunday   Unsure of when I got up exactly, and since I can't remember it was obviously too early, left for New York, which meant another arbitrarily long coach journey...  Got there, eventually, and wandered about various places, Rockefeller Centre, (or maybe center, depending on preference), Times...uh...Blob? Seriously though, I can't really see a polygon let alone a square, so best word to describe it would probably be blob...  The next stop was the Intrepid Museum...  *Insert rant about stupid paranoid Americans here, use your imagination, the author is too tired*  We stood waiting outside for about 30 minutes in the scorching sun while the stupid security people checked out everyone...  *mutters*  The museum consists of the Intrepid Aircraft Carrier, Growler Submarine...  And a Concorde....  yep... a concorde...  anyway, because of renovations or something you weren't even allowed on to the flight deck,  After that it was a boat trip round the Statue of Liberty,  I'll finish this tomorrow, too tired right now...  Meh...
