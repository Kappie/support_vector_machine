I've been meeting with a number of different people lately and having pretty good conversations with 'em, so that's what I'm going to write about this evening.  Two nights ago I was over at Edmund Ho's apartment. He fixed dinner for Peter, Omar, Melanie and myself. It was real nice 'cause it got us to forget about our awful renal tests earlier that day.  Edmund is Houston Rockets fan and is actually pretty politically-minded. We got to talking about Bush vs. Kerry, the obesity epidemic, gay marriage, all kinds of things and I really enjoyed it. We share many social views, but differ a lot on the U.S. foreign policy/foreign aid ideas.  While I was at Edmund's place I got a call from Michael Barham (my old RA supervisor and good friend) and I was really surprised to learn that he was in Philedelphia with Ashley Colburn (my RA friend from Asheville, NC). He's there on a conference until sunday. It would have been fun to be there with them, but I was at least glad that they seemed to be having a good time together.   On friday evening I worked first aid at the Fort Worth Race for the Cure. I put in about 10 hours of work and was completely spent after it was done. While I was there I worked with Gabe Tarango and Gary Howard. Gabe Tarango is in my first-year class and it a pretty fun guy to talk with. Like me, he lives a somewhat tame and boring life right now, but last year during his senior year of college he was a party animal. He was also dating an older, very nice looking physical therapy student for about 7 months. We both talked at length about wanting to get out into the city and meet new people.   Gary Howard is an EMT and paramedic-student. He was pretty much running the first-aid show there at the Race for the Cure. Damn, I don't even know where to begin with this guy. I should say that one of the fascinating things about EMS is that the people are so damn interesting. Seriously, you have to some kind of seriously interesting character to want to get into EMS and Gary was certainly interesting. I'd say that Gary is probably in his 50's, is a Vietnam War veteran, and came into EMS a few years ago after selling his previous two businesses. He's also a bit of a cowboy and has a shit-load of stories about saving stupid people's lives out in the middle of nowhere. We talked for most of the evening and it was pretty enjoyable. Talking with him helped remind me how much I miss EMS.   Will McKnight came over on saturday to watch the Duke game. We had fajitas. Will and I spent a lot of time looking at crazy crap on the internet and yelling at the TV. We did talk a little bit about the lifestyles of those on "regular hours" versus those on "student hours." He said he misses being able to stay up past 10pm, whereas sometimes I feel like I would do anything to go to sleep and get up earlier. We had a good time I think. It's very reassuring to know that I have friends outside of my med school class.    Like I said, stuff is going pretty well right now and my renal grades turned out ok. The weather's nice and my allergies are subsiding, so I'm pretty happy. I've been in Fort Worth for almost a year now and I am starting to feel at home.    Songs of the day  Moby,  Porcelain , 1999.
