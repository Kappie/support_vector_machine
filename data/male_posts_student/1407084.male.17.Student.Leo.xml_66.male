Good thing I was in a good mood, or this would really have been a disaster  Should the drunken coward that decided to throw that beer bottle through my rear windshield late last night ever come forth, I'd like to have a few words with him. Now I have to drive around with this really gay looking piece of plastic duct taped onto my rear windshield until I can get it fixed. Excuse my angry sound.. to tell you the truth, I am not really that angry about it, I just wish the person would step forth and get me a new windshield  Also, if your name is CJ or Allison, I can't take you to school for a while until I get this fixed..  To end on a happy note, I get to spend time with some friends tonight. Hopefully we will have as much fun as I think we are going to have.
