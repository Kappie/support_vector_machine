I was doing the english thing and I read "I wandered lonely as a cloud"  and I thought "that would be better as 'I wandered as a lonely child' " and so then I was thinking hey, maybe i should make a whole poem out of lines of other poems but just changed slightly.  Or maybe if it works out well, make more than one poem, a whole new kind of poem (although thats unlikely)
