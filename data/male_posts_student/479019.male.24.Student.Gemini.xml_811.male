I think I still taste gin in my breath. The Jack In The Box couldn't even over power it. It was cool. It's especially cool since Flo and Nai are taking off in the next few days anyway. So it was cool to see them before they leave.  Jon got fucked up. But hey he got a massage from some chick as a consolation prize... that's a decent exchange right?  ***
