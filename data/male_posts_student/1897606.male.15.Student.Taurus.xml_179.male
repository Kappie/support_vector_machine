The only phrases I heard on the way home were "Fuck, I fucking need a fucking cigarette," "Fucking smoke party at my fucking house, dog!" and "Look at this fucking rich neighborhood." That's right fuckers, I'm fucking rich. I whipe my ass with 20's.  It's so comical how people just NEED to fit in somewhere. I seriously think the only reason people smoke is so they can bitch about how they need a cigarette and sound like such an uber-badass. And they succeed! Whenever I hear a kid talking about how he's going to get hella stoned, I think to myself, "I wish I could be that guy. I wish I could be cool enough to get high all the time. Since, you know, drugs are so cool." Totally. Ahh it's just funny. There's this whole group of people who hang together just because they all...like...smoking? Yeah...doesn't get much cooler.  If you're going to get high, keep it to yourself. Nobody gives a shit except for your equally pathetic stoner friends.
