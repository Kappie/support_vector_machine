But I guess on a species-specific level, I like the look of a good rhino.  2. What pets have you had in your lifetime?  One. Although I might have had a fish at some point.  3. Is there any specific pet that you've wanted but never had? Why?  Not really. I might like a cat, but my current dog wouldn't allow that.  4. Are you allergic to any animals?  No.  5. Do you have any 'pet' pet peeves (your pets or others')?  I hate when people leave pets outside to range free and kill birds (cats) and bark (dogs).
