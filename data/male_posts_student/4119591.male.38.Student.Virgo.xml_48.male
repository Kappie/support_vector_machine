I can't count the number of times I've been in Taiwan and haven't been able to find a decent donut (I can't count it because zero doesn't require counting although the number is roughly donut-shaped.)   Word on the street (or cul-de-sac) is that if Mr. Donut does well, the owner will follow up with the much needed Mr. Saltine and Mr. Pencil Sharpener.
