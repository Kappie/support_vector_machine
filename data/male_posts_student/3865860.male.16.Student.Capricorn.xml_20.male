After that we went back to Roz's house to watch school of rock and drink. Was cool because i don't ever get to see or speak to those guys hardly ever :) LAter on we went to take George back to the train station but we ended up randomly walking to emma troths house who i dont know at all but now at least i can say i've been in her bedroom ;) Altogether its been cool today seeing different people, hope to see you again guys!
