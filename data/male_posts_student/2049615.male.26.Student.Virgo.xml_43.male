The other day at the movies I saw a preview for a movie called  Collateral , in which Jamie Foxx is posited as the next Denzel Washington, right down to the pencil mustache and eyelid tic standing in for everyman modesty.  At issue however is his costar.  First time you see Tom Cruise, he sits down in Jamie Foxx's cab and introduces himself;  it sounds for all the world like he's saying "I'm Goodson."  As in the main character in  Risky Business .  So as the preview progresses with lots of gunplay, threats, and moral ambiguity I'm thinking how damn clever it was to make today's silver-haired assassin the same character as yesterday's amateur brothelkeeper.  Very heavy-handedly moralistic, but still clever.  Clearly Tom Cruise is playing the same character in both films:  same mannerisms and oily chumminess.  Then I see the same preview at a different movie and realize he said "I'm Vincent", and that what was actually happening is Tom Cruise has played the same character in every movie he's been in since 1980.
