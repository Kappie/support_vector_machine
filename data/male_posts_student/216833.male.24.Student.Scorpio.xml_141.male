I am planning a ski trip for January in the tahoe area. Actually Bear Valley. http://www.bearvalley.com so if you wanna do it, let me know and I can hook you up with all the info.  MiMi and I went up to Jenner last wednesday and found this tiny forest road called Fort Ross Rd. We were on the curvy road for about an hour, the only ones on the road. It was so fucking awesome. I had a good time just looking at all the valleys and tiny little towns. The smell of fireplaces and the scent of pine and redwood is so "life-giving." Makes me totally feel alive.  Now I have to get ready to go sale some Fucking RINGS AND BULLSHIT!   current mood:  lonely current music: the beatles
