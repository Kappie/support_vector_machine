Here it is again if you are interested:   urlLink The Roper Poll   In this poll, three quarters of those surveyed said they were prepared for the discovery of intelligent extra-terrestrial life. I don't believe this data is accurate. I would say that this number is as believable as the percentage of Americans who call themselves Christians. While these people may think they are ready for the consequences of alien intelligence, they most likely are not.  Here are some of the consequences: 1. Many relgions are no longer valid. Christianity, Islam, and Judaism all have thier creation stories wrong. They would either need to modify their "truths" or die. I would bet they would adapt, because the idea that they are utterly false illusions created to rule over men's minds is unacceptable to the common man. Also consider that an older race might have a firmer grasp of "truth" than we do. Who might convert to alien religions? 2. We suddenly have competition in the universe. If we are the only sentience, then we have all the time we need to expand and exploit resources as we need. With another group of beings out there, we had best hurry up our exploration and stake claims to what we want. Because it is logical for competition to occur over the scarce resources out there.  3. Who will represent us to them? What if they have nations? Are they united? Shoudl we lie to them? If we find them first, do we want to talk to them? Is some sort of united earth government needed to face the challenge of interaction in a suddenly more crowded universe? 4. The ultimate threat: They might decide to attack us. The sad truth is that there is room for only one race to lay claim to resources. I would favor annhilating the aliens if we posess the means. Just as the native Indians were wiped out for all intents so too must one race or the other become the master of another. Do not think I condone what happened to the Indians, but it was an inevitable result of the clash of civilizations. Because they were so incompatible, they had to battle for supremacy. The strong take from the weak. I hope the aliens are weaker than we are.  I suppose the idea that there are aliens is similar to a belief in God. Both are unseen, and seem to offer both hope and fear to those who believe. Hope in that it is the idea that there is a higher purpose in the case of God, or that life is plentiful in the case of aliens. Fear, as God holds power over everything, and aliens might bring a plethora of problems. I think we simply cannot plan or be ready for the discovery of aliens. AS long as they don't show up on our doorstep one day, we can at least expect hundreds of years of warning due to the speed of transmissions and of space travel.   Now I ask if we want to search for them? Is it worthwhile? Do we really want to find them or to try to isolate ourselves? We cannot assume they are out there, so it might well be a waste of resources to look. By the same token, any space exploration beyond what brings us immediate gain might be a waste. President Bush has proposed that we go back to the Moon and to Mars with manned missions. But for what purpose besides the need to explore? Why do we want to do these things? The cost is high, in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Is it worth it?  I say we must do it. I want us to accelerate our exploration and exploitation of space. There is no room to expand left on earth, so we must head into space. Space is free of competing nations, so we (the United States) can take what we want. But only if we are bold. I admit to an emotional need to see space exploration continue. I feel it embodies the very essence of being human. To dare what can't be done, to seek the next horizon and find the truths of the universe. If we turn inward and eschew expansion and discovery, we sign our own death warrants. Societies must always expand and dream big in order to survive. Though it is cliche, Space is the Final Frontier.  I cannot predict what benefits and challenges aggressive space exploration might bring us. But I want to face those challenges and reap those rewards right now. I want to see a man step out onto Mars in my lifetime. The troubles that the small-minded see all around us: hunger, poverty, ignorance, fundamentalism, health care - are all going to be with us no matter how much money we waste on them. But money directed towards exploration is money well-spent. It brings tangible results. It employs skilled workers, it glorifies achievement, and it gives form to the dream of the human spirit to discover the unknown.   I cannot over-emphasise the need for dreams and ambition. When someone ceases to dream he dies that very instant. When your reach ceases to exceed your grasp you have given up on life. Pushing back the frontier is a tremendous dream. I am inspired by the Mars rover missions. They are noble missions to seek the truths of life. This big dream can help up to rise above the small things that divide us. I would hope all of America could unite in a quest for expansion into space. But I fear we will always be distracted by the mewing of those who do not want to provide for themselves.  You cannot solve any problems with money! Giving a starving man a loaf only prolongs his condition! Either let him die of teach him to feed himself! Otherwise you perpetuate his weakness. Apply this logic to all of the social issues.   I wish we could have private enterprise lead the way into space, but national security and the sheer scale of such an undertaking necessitate federal guidance. Once it has been shown that there is profit to be made in space, private investment will expand to fulfill that potential. I would hope that NASA would enable free exploration, but maintain regulation. we can't let space fall to some competing interest, such as the EU or China. Space offers both promis and peril. As space becomes more utlilized, weaponry and defense will need to keep pace. I favor a unilateral program by the US to lead the way. A coalition of the willing, so to speak. I want the Stars and Stripes planted on Mars, not the UN flag or the hammer and sickle.  Bah, I'm tired.
