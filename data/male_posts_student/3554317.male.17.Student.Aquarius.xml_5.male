La Pucelle Tactics is a game I am in desperate need of.  Disgaea: Hour of Darkness was most awesome and it fulfilled my strategy/tactical turn-based RPG desires.  La Pucelle looks just as good, and from what I've heard, is even better.  I tip my hat to the good people at Nippon Ichi for lavishing their attention on the sRPG genre and giving them new dimensions of gameplay.  I haven't gotten decent sleep in days, and being super tired at 2 in the afternoon right now really shows it.  I need coffee.
