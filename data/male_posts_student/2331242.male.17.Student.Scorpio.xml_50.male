       
      I give up. It's no use fighting anymore. I can't win, but why would I want to? What would I accomplish? I can be just as happy going with the flow, not adding even more stress to my life than I already have.  If anyone is reading this, I need your help. I need your support, not your cutdowns. I need a good laugh, not one more thing that I, or someone that I care about, has done wrong. Let's leave it at that.
