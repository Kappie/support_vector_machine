(Again, thanks alot Burlbaw - you fucking asshole). So, here I am waiting for my 2:30 class chillin in the 'brary. About to read one of my Sociology books for an hour, head t the union, grab some grub, and head to class, THEN take the bus back home. The weekend was pretty crappy overall and we got about 4 inches of snow yesterday to boot, not to mention it's freakin' cold here!  Bonomo said some bullshit about how he's going to send out some e-mail....well, I haven't gotten it yet so either write it quick, or be called a LIAR. (Dude, I'm bored as hell right now so bite me!)  Well, that's it for now....off to read....and continue to swear at Burlbaw underneath my breath for the remainder of the week.
