Last Issue:  "For A While I Say "Goodbye"    I've been sick for the past three days with something weird. But I missed school for two days, Thursday and Friday. I wanted to go to the Sandbox Heroes show but I couldn't cause of sickness. grr. I hate it. Saturday I was feeling a little better, it was more around five when I felt good. I went out to eat with my good friend Amber. She's a cool cat. Then we went over to Rich's, he needed some guitar string or something so I brought it over there.   peace
