Today is Memorial Day and I was just thinking how much I appreciate all the freedoms and protection we have as Americans.  Both of my grandpas went to war.  On my mom's side my grandpa served for four or more years and on my dad's side he served for about four years as well.  It's crazy to think that they went through so much for us today.  It's also weird knowing that someday some of us might take part in a war.  I just wanted to get my first post out and see what other people thought about on Memorial Day.  GOD BLESS!
