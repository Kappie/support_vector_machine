The park was alright, we played don't touch the ground tag for a little while! Than, Taylors mom picked us up and we just hung out at their house for a while! It was REALLY fun being with Taylor, we had never hug out alone and trying to play karaoke was AWESOME! Than, Tara got out of her 2.3 hour shower and watched Peter Pan with us! We than all went to Down in the Valley. What an awesome store! Oh yeah, we ha a great talk about winning the powerball. Tara is gonna by some powerball tickets and win the 212 million dollar PRIZE! It's gonna happen! We than went to Arby's. That was probably the funniest thing ever. I pretended Tara was my mom who had me at age sixteen. I was screaming how It's not my fault she got knocked up, and I wanna live with daddy, and how she always gets me curly fries when I ask for straight fries. Wow, that was great! We than picked up Derek, Thomas, Steph and Matt! We went out to Friday's for Tara's 18th BIRTHDAY! That was fun! I got some sesame chicken strips and saw my favorite waitress, Jessica! It was really fun! We than went to this park and hung out. S**** was being kinda weird and was flirting with M*** alot. Whatever, even though she says she likes me! Wanna know the best part, I HAVE MOVED ON! I still wanna be friends with S****, but I really like someone new! I will update you all more on that a bit later! Than Tara and Taylor drove me home and Steph forgot her book. I talked to Steph and she thought it was Tara for like ten minutes. It turns out Steph FORGOT HER BAG in Tara's car and wanted Tara to drop it off. But it was gonna be past their curfew so they couldn't. It's not Tara's fault, but it's not steph's fault either! I gg thought! ~Andy Joke Of The Moment: What did Hellen Keller say to my mom? "Hey Judy"!
