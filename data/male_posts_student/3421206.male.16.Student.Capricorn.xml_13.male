Joker on Jack.  Match on a fire.  Cold on ice. A dead man's touch.  Whisper on a scream. Yeah doesn't change a thing.  Don't bring you back.  Blue on Black.  "Blind. Now I see.  Truth, lies, and in between.  Wrong can't be undone.  Slipped from the tip pf my toungue.  "Blue on Black.  Tears on a river.  Push on a shove.  It don't mean much.  Joker on Jack.  Match on a fire.  Cold on ice. A dead man's touch.  Whisper on a scream. Yeah doesn't change a thing.  Don't bring you back.  Blue on Black."       "Blue on Black" by Kenny Wayne Shepherd is one of my favorite songs right now. I love the lyrics and the solo. But you can't hear the solo. Too bad. Go by the CD. Or listen to it online. The CD is call "Trouble Is"....go buy it. Every song is good. Well....I am outta here. Have fun. Cyaz!!!
