Sitting here thinking, am i doing the right thing? What should be the right thing in the first place. Regretting? hmm i definitely hope not for this will be the first time... I have always been so sure, so positive of my actions and never have i once looked back to say that sucks and i should not have done that. Why am i doing so now? What's going on.....      Pride, honour, Promise.... You can lose it all but these... They will be with you till your very end and eventually for humans, will be the measure of their worth. Am i worthless? Does it really matter? or am i just doing it to please... Who can i please if i cannot even please myself..      My cries for help go unnoticed, unheard.. The people around me all keep smiling, keep moving in the herd... Gradually i learned to accept, to forget... That as myself an individual, it doesnt matter much who cares or who doesnt.. Whose to know whats true and whats false.. Whats the point..      Will i regret writing this eventually? No... i wont... But will i regret actions i take in my life like one i have just done... Maybe.. Sadly.. Maybe.. It is an eventuality which even i fear i will face but hold on i will.....      "suffering but i have no regret,   this pain how can i ever forget.   misery which stretches to unknown degrees,   my life spells out to the finality of tragedy.   dreaming, wishing, hoping for the sadness to be taken away,   only to be dissappointed, let down,    left alone eventually...."
