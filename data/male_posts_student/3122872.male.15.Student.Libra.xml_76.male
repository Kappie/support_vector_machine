I just come upstairs from about 10 minutes of "don't do this don't do that do this do that, oh by the way, we give you the freedom you want so don't complain..." It takes quite alot of self control to stop my self from screaming FUCK OFF, :/ what can you do... bah now to do something creative  oh and by the way go read The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, have been spending about 6 hours reading it now and eyes are getting sore...  :P
