We finally finished the long song which has no name yet because Gavin has to write the lyrics because he needed to the hear the song first to write it. It's gonna be a story song. There's alot transitions and I think it's a mix of Tool/Korn/Rush/Coheed. Oh yea Jimmy came over too. Don't worry Heaton and James and whoever else...we still exist. I still can't wait for Heaton's brother to come home because Heaton said he's amazing and it's always fun to jam with amazing guitarists. Paul is really good too. Maybe he'll end up joining that band. 2 bands...very confusing and now with Matt in SSM, it's very odd. Not sure if it'll last but for now it's good. Ok, so nothing new, drummed my ass off today, really tired now, goodnight.
