The whole time I just played on Joe's Mom's laptop and relized one of my friends from Great Hollow smokes pot! After Joe's, my mom and I went to get a car wash and we got to go through the washer swiper thingies, it was awesome! I haven't done that in like 7 years. Then we went to La Famiglia to set up a party for my sister's communion.Nothing else happened... just another boring day and then I relized, school makes the day something to talk about. Woah, I didn't just say that!
