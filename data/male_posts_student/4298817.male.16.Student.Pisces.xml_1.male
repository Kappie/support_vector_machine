Wilhelm Stekel (featured in  The Catcher in the Rye ).  Disregarding the majority of humanity - the hoi polloi - as they are entirely irrelevant and superfluous to any anthropological discussion of merit that does not directly involve them, I wish to ascertain the veracity and pertinence of this aphorism.  I must confess that the idea of pledging my allegiance to a cause I deem truly worthy does appeal, in, perhaps, a similar way that an ephemeral freedom from conscious thought, as in the Bacchanalia of  The Secret History,  appeals to some. While the latter frees a person from any concept of or desire for a purpose, the other provides one. Thus, rather than wandering aimlessly on whim and influence, malign or benign, through these years of experience, one would have a guiding ideal.   "A man who won't die for something is not fit to live."  So Martin Luther King would have us believe. Was this an immature statement? I certainly disagree with it. Am I mature? Am I not fit to live? I wouldn't choose to die for a cause; or at least, I do not wish to entangle myself in anything that might imbue me with sufficient irrationality to be able even to contemplate such an act. However, the prospect of committing myself to a life of humble subservience to a cause is very nearly as unappealing. I would, instead, wish to have some integral role in the cause, to be a dynamic, contributory, and enduring asset, but also a questioning, redirecting entity, only compliant as long as the ends of the cause complimented my own.  It seems to me that where Stekel says "mature" we should read "jaded", a confusion so pervasive I have almost to believe that they have become genuinely synonymous. In that case, maturity is not something to be aspired to, if the state of fulfilment to which it pertains entails this vapid quiescence, this mollifying of human vigour and valiance.  Martin Luther King's assertion probably derives in part from his religious views. Religion, being primarily (in the modern world), a mechanism employed to insulate the individual from the horrors of stark reality, an illusory solace, the opiate of the masses, etcetera, is an immaturity, because it requires a verdant ignorance that no intellectually developed person could maintain, and because that craven contentment in delusion is infantile. This devoted, deferential, injudicious belief in something just for devotion's sake that leads a person to give their life to a cause, is immature in the same way.  To conclude, I hold Stekel's aphoristic pronouncement to be true, although in a way he had not intended, holding as contemptible both of the options he presents, and suggesting instead a constructive and questioning alliance with a greater body of mutual principle to be the objective of the ideal individual. However, even this outcome is immaterial. I excerpt a passage from a conversation conducted between myself and a friend:  "Myself: Do you think that if someone formed some revolutionary movement that actually had the potential to achieve those things (I realise how quixotic a hypothetical situation that is) you could be motivated to contribute your full efforts to it?  Him: Well yes, but that's like saying: "If Sweden and Hungary went to war, causing chaos in the terpentine industry, and all other turpentine manufacturers went out of business, would you be prepared to go into selling emergency turpentine to sweden and hungary to make millions of pounds?" Obviously the answer is yes, but the situation will never arise. I don't even know what the fuck turpentine is."  This, in a somewhat obfuscated fashion, relates an important truth. In this world there is an absence of any cause of any kind that warrants either living or dying for, and any attempt to create one is doomed to almost inevitable failure by the apathy and mediocrity of contemporary humanity. So, fuck it all.
