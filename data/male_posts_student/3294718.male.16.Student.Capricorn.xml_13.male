I had to do a camera because there were not enough cameras, and it was chaos. Cords everywhere, things screwing up, etc. I realized that I probably won't see almost all of the TV Pro people again, and that was sad. There are only a few of us coming back next year.   Tomorrow is the last day of school, and I am seriously considering skipping hours 4/5. Nothing is happening, and I don't really want to get up early.  After school we went and played hackey sack and football in the park. That was fun.   Joe is having an all-night barbecue, which is going to suck for him if it rains. I'll probably go by there tomorrow morning and check out how he's doing.  Haven't seen the Hobster for a while. I wonder how things are goin' with him.  I'm going to pick up Chris after school, and we'll probably have fun.   I am going to shoot off the remainder of my pictures tomorrow.  So today I was bringing Houley home, and all of a sudden we see John. Naturally, we wonder where the hell John is going, because he said he was going home. So we follow him for a while, and he finds out that we were following him and stops at Houley's house. So I don't know where he was going, but I have a pretty damn good idea.  I'll probably post something longer tomorrow or Friday.  Until then.
