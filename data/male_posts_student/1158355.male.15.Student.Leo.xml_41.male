At church, the priest was talking about all we need is faith and then some asshole came up talking about how the church needs money. Yea, Catholicism sucks. That's why I'm converting to Judiusm. But I'm still celebrating the Catholic holidays, like Christmas and Easter... basically taking advantage of them both. That's the only thing I thank Jesus for, for being born and for dying which both made these two wonderful holidays. After church, we went to La Famiglia where we yelled at the waiters. A magician guy came who cut me in half with a real saw! My blood was all over the floor, it was awesome. Then he lit the blanket on fire that was above me and I started cracking up. I gave the guy the finger as he left. Fucking asshole tried to trick me with his tricks, I knew it all along, the bunnies and piggens were in his pockets and sleeves. Then everyone came back to my house. We played outside and Chris pissed on random places in my yard. Then I played basketball, Me and Paul vs Dan (my cousin) and Ricky... we never got to finish the game but I'm guessing me and Paul would of won after the major come back we had at the end. Sad thing is we never ended up getting Chinese food. Everyone left, I played drums, then Zelda, then bed.
