Tonight was the concert and there ain't no cure for the summertime blues...can't wait for Rush's Feedback album to come out with all their 60's covers, yes. Anyways, personally I thought we could have done better but it was good. Someone stole my go-go bells (I call em go-go boots) so I had to use 2 different cowbells, sounded like crap or as Matt M says, "SOUNDS LIKE FUCK!" Haha. Anyways, yea so I played cowbells in Evita and cymbals in Finlandia (For The Russians!) Rich's girlfriend, Kira from Hauppauge was there. Bunches of other happy people. Bryan Retus is a good drummer. My ego shot up today but I think it's bullshit. My mom met Mrs. Kalabza today and she told my mom Mr. Caserta said I was the best drummer he ever heard (in Smithtown School Discrict I'm guessing). Yea ok...he was my private teacher a few years back but then I didn't know how to do squat. I wonder if what he said is true, what his reaction will be when he hears my present day drumming. Eh, I'm not that great. I mean I'm good. But nothing special. Maybe I'm like in top 20 drummers of Smithtown High School. Yea in fact I suck at drums. In fact I don't know what I'm talking about. But I'm gonna do jazz ensemble next year, I wanna play one of those jazzy solos...Buddy Rich style. So yea it was a good concert. Bryan Retus also played a little set for the orchestra's "Bohemian Rhapsody" which was pretty good. Pirates of The Carribean was great also and they played a song from Platoon but I don't know which one, my mom said it was from Platoon. Saw it a long time ago, all I remembered is it made me wanna kill an American soldier when he starts beating to death, a poor innocent Vietnamese kid with his rifle. Horrible, but sadly close to the Vietnam truth. I went to Carvel after it all. Uh, that's it. I'm thinking too much about joining the Jazz Ensemble next year, seeing Aerosmith and seeing RUSH!!! I saw the setlist, it might change for each show, lets hope they add Freewill when I see them. They're gods. Bye.
