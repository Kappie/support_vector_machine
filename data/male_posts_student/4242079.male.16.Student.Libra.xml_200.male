Before, it was overflowing with useless garbage. Most of it is in a black garbage bag just inside my door now. I took my old chair away, and now the new on is in here. This one if far bigger, and looks rather out of place in this room. Oh well. One day I will be able to fill more than just one bedroom with stuff. And it will be grand. At any rate. Currently, my bed has on it: a laundry basket filled with pants, a VCR, three DVDs, 5 books, 12 notebooks, a TV, 2 binders, 1 jacket, one shoebox filled with pictures and letters, a blue shirt, and some toothpaste. No sheets though, and no place for me to sleep. So, I think I will either sleep in this chair, or perhaps move to the couch later. But right now. I'm in my chair.  I found a lot of stuff while I was cleaning today. Including some Grinch boxers from last Christmas. The tag is still attached. I think I will wear them tomorrow. They have a picture of the Grinch on them, and they say MEAN 1. It's all rather exciting. I hope that they're mine.  Oh boy. Look what happens when Dayv isn't here. I start writing about my underwear.  Oh. There she is!
