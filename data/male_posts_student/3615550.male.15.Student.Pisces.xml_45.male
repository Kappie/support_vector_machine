Haha!  I'll be staying here for a couple of days, and then we'll be off to New Jersey for three days. This is really a business trip, but my dad decided to bring us along and make the trip into a vacation of sorts.   We stopped by Gettysburg on our way here, and it was quite interesting. We took a bus tour, and I had never realized just what went on at Gettysburg. Sure, I had read some stuff, but I was able to see just how the battle went with the tour and an electric map presentation of sorts. I'll post the pictures soon.  Anyway, I thought I'd let you know what's up. I have been typing all sorts of things on the laptop while we were driving, and I'll try to post some of it. I should be staying in the hotel room for most of today and tomorrow, so maybe I can get my cyberlife caught up in that time.  Be blessed! Neo
