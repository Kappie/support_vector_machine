I learned that I can't dance worth crap.  Oh well, I never expected to be good at it.  Then after prom when we were trying to find a starbucks I ended up racing the car that we were with.  It was fun, mostly because he got pullled over and I didn't.  Then we just decided to go to whitecastle.  After that, Laura and I went back to her house and changed.  Then Laura and I spent all of saturday together, it was fun.  As of right now I only have one free weekend until the end of school, thanks to scouting.  I will probably end up doing something that weekend also.  I can't wait till school ends.  The end is so close, and then I will only I have one dumb year left in school.  I want camp to come also, I miss the waterfront.  We are going to have no one experienced there this year though.  I really want to go to the Blink182 concert on June 1st, but I do not think that my mom will let me.  Who is goint to the spring fellowship?  Steve and I will be there late.  Well, that is all I have for now.  See ya.
