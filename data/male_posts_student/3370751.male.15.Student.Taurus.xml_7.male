But now that I have your attention...well you know the drill.       urlLink Free! or Am I?     urlLink Electric Guitar     urlLink The Terminal     urlLink Many More Days To Come        FREE AT LAST, OR AM I?    I still remember the first day I stepped onto TCHS grounds, and that's alot since I can only vaguely remember what I did this morning.  So, I conclude, this year has only passed in the time span of less than 4 hours.  Just kidding.  But anyway, the last day of school sort of just crept by; I didn't even know, until Thursday night, we had no school the next day.  I think it was because of the finals, but luckily that's all over and we have the rest of summer to kick back and enjoy.    Well, for some people at least.  If you're like me, you have summer school.  I think the word  summer  is great, I think the word  school  is alright, but when those words unite, who would have ever thought it would be so horrible?  I mean, you add 3 and 4 (two very good numbers; and they're good only because if they weren't, my analogy wouldn't make sense), and you get 7 (a fabulous number by the way).  You don't get 1 (which is a horrible number, and again it's horrible because then my analogy works).  So, obviously then...summer school must be defying the laws of numbers!  Yes, I realize there are no "laws of numbers" that make one number better than another.  But whether the laws exist or not, summer school is still illegal, and hax0rs always get logged out.      ELECTRIC GUITAR     I was looking at some guitars the other day and came across this  urlLink one .  The price is only $109.99, 110, so I figure if I get $10 bucks a week, for allowance that is, I'll have to save for 11 weeks, or 3 months.  Not bad, not bad at all.    Then my dad came along.  Now, he's usually a tough one 'cause no matter what I say, he  thinks all I need in life is nothing but the bare necessities.  Which is true, but it's not like I'm hitching a free ride here; if I want something from that guy, I gotta work my ass off.    "Hey, dad, can I show you something?"  "What?  Your report card?"    Oh great, that's just great.  Now he's expecting something good on my report card, and I have to let him down with the idea of an electric guitar.    "No, no, that's not coming until later.  But take a look at this."    I showed him the giant image of the guitar.   "Wow, that looks good."   "Yeah, it looks really good.  It comes with an amp, the guitar itself, 3 picks, a cable, the case, and a chord book.  A guitar, alone, already costs, at minimal, $115.  This package has everything you need already for only $110.  So I was thinking, if I save for about 11 weeks, I could get it.  But it  is  the summer, and I'd really like it if I could play a little before school starts.  So you think you could give me an advance?"    "You already have one," he said.  And those words almost made me lose hope.    "Yeah, I know.  But there's two types of guitars.  And acoustic, and an electric.  They both sound different, and this offer is just too good."    "Well, fine.  Only, though, if you do my laundry, the dishes, iron my clothes, and vacuum the house every week, for let's say...a year.  And when you get your first job, you're paying me back $110."    "What?  I thought you were giving me an advance, why do I have to pay you back?"    "The $110 is not for the guitar, it's the extra fees I'm charging you for an advance."    "You're turning into a corrupted bank."    "Don't make me change my mind."   "Yes, sir."    Wow, I can't believe I am that lucky.  A little work here and there, but in the long run, it'll all pay off.  How will it pay off you ask?    ......  Yeah, anyways, it's going to pay off, whether I can answer you right now or not.      THE TERMINAL (THE MOVIE)    I'm going to pretend today is sunday.  So "today" I went to church at about 9:30.  Worship songs, yadayadayada, hypocrisy speech, blah blah blah, bible study, erghhhtheyuaa, and then a gourmet lunch at the built in restuarant.  (Chicken and rice at the cafeteria.)    Afterwards, me and some people,  urlLink John ,  urlLink Stuart , and  urlLink Ben  (who I believe now owes me 7 bucks), went to the movie theaters on Atlantic, 'cause Temple City didn't have  The Terminal , and we waited for an hour until the movie started.  And if you haven't caught on, the movie was  The Terminal .    It was, just flat out, a good movie.  Creative; a nice fresh breeze of change from the  man has this much alotted time to save the world and catch some chicks on the way  movie.  Honestly, who could have ever thought of a movie about a guy stuck at an airport terminal?  And to make it good too!?  Geniuses I tell you.  I highly recommend it.      MANY MORE DAYS TO COME...    Have a good summer everybody.  Unless you have summer school, then I guess...well, don't have a good summer.  Unless you like summer school, then, by all means, have a horrible summer.    And remember, buy candy from Ben and Stuart; they're raising money for BS.....S.  On the market, each item costs $1.  Mention my name, and they'll give it to you for half price.  If at first, they say no, be persistent; it's a code I worked out with them.  You have to at least ask 3 times.    Okay, bye now.  Oh yeah, and if you see me running and if they're close behind, you have to jump in and stop them.  It's another code, and they'll give you free candy bars.
