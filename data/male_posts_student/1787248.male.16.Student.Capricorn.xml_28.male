I should become a rapper, take the world over while it's sittin' on the crapper.  Word.  You're scurred.  Soooooo JP wants me to go to the store today and pick up some Ultima Online CDs.... and then I'm supposed to play Ultima Online.  I think I'll go but not stay for long.  Hey, it's a free game...  So Team Fear the Mullet is getting it's own segment on Dealers, which you can check out EVERY FRIDAY at some time.... I think it's like 7:30 central time I don't remember.   urlLink http://www.macharbor.com/dealers .  On our first segment, we will be covering strategy for a long forgotten superstar of the past, Road Dogg.   I've been working on some t3ch for Gencon... since... it's like 18 days away.  SHIT! Gencon's 18 days away!  YAYYYYYY    My Sealab and Aqua Teen collections are almost complete, with like 5 more episodes left for each.  I'm addicted to NFL2k5.. and everyone should buy it.  But for Xbox, not PS2.  And if you don't have an Xbox, trade your PS2 in towards one.   It's almost that time of year again where I'm only available after 3PM on weekdays.  I'm kind of looking forward to it.  But I'm looking forward to the events that will be happening before it (Finch, Gencon) a lot more.  School = good stories = good times.  Word.  Speaking of Finch, Disturbed = a bunch of fucking pussies.  I hope Dave's head is still hurtin'  Thinking about Finch makes me think about concerts.  TAKING BACK SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 30TH MILWAUKEE WISCONSIN THATS RIGHT BITCHES WE'RE THE 3RD DATE ON THE TOUR!!!  YEAH SUCK IT DRY!  I rule you.
