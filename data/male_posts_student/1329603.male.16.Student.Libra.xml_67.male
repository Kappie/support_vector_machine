I'm still feeling really ill at the moment... during the Pirates rehearsal I had to bring a chair onto the stage, my excuse being that I could either have a chair or they could watch me faint.  Mrs. Briscowe is apparently very pissed about me not being able to attend the Senoir Drama group meeting. It's not that I can't understand why but I dislike it more than she does. Colwell have shot me in the foot.  A little bit hyper about the Mr. Jones album ^^.  I've still got to do my English coursework..... ahhhhhhhfeckit.
