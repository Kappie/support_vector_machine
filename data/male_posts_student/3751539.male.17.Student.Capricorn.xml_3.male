I walk across the stage, get my diploma, listen to the valedictorian, the salutatorian, the class officers, and the class advisors give speeches that I have heard many times before.  It doesn't make the words they say any less true, but it does make them slightly repetitive.  They will talk about dreams and goals and working for the improvement of society.  I'm looking forward to it actually, because the speeches will be the jumping board to greater truths.  They will say the what, I will discover the why.  Funny thing about graduation.  I hardly thought about the event until this morning.  My life has been so full of changing and the future and constant development that events like the last Falcon Report show, the last day of school, the last day of tests, the last goodbye to many of my friends, are just progressions, small steps.  Graduation was heading in that same direction, being just the next step.  But that is not why graduation exists.  It is not the next step.  It is not part of the progression.  Most of those events weren't.  They are the moments when you look back with understanding at the past.  When you say, "Making friends in my teenage years was important, it taught and changed me in profound ways." "My education in High School was important, I learned much about myself, my society, and my people, and I am now a more glorious and capable being because of these years."  These events are when you are supposed to realize and focus on how eternal your life is, and how important these individual quests (ie: education) are.  I didn't understand that till now.    I am off...
