Apparently the buttons are coming out for mac when the new edition of Safari comes out, but until then, posting has to be without cool FX, like bold, italics, underlines, sizing, and colours.  Sad, so sad.  I am updating this blog WAY more than I should. People won't be able to keep up. :p  By the way, if you're new to this blog, remember to start from the top, or in this case, the bottom of the page. Archives go back to the beginning, and that's where the first couple posts are. So. Read those first.  If you read this post without reading my older material, you are bad. Get your hot girlfriend to give you an erotic spanking.
