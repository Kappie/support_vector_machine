I was stunned to heard that my Frenz-A's dad passed away becuz of illness.. I and Frenz-A were reali veri gd frenz in our sec sch days.. Yet he did not told me abt it.. I think the incident happened 2yrs le.. It was kinda disappointed.. We are frenz for 10+yrs le.. In the end, it was someone else who told me.. After thinking for one night, I finali begin to realise that he reali treats me as a gd frenz that why he did not wan me to know abt it.. Knowing that I will be worried abt him.. Nevertheless I reali hope that if there is anything that cropped up in the future again, he will let me know.. That I do..     In The End.. Its Only The Fittest Survive In This World.. If You Are Strong You Live.. If You Are Weak You Die.. That's The Truth!!    *MerQu|s3*^^ aka *yeKai*^^
