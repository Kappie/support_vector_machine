New features include:  - Extension Manager - Theme Manager - Data Migration/Import - New Visual Theme - Better Bookmarks - Better Search - Smaller Download - Online Help - And a Bunch of Bug Fixes  If you've never tried Firefox, you need to seriously give it a shot. Some of the extension addons are amazing, and truly make it a better browser than Internet Explorer. I've found the integrated pop-up blocker to be the best in the biz, and the tabbed browsing blows away the clunkiness of multiple IE windows.   urlLink Download it here!
