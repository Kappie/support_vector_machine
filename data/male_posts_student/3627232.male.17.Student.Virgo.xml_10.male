The walk is long But they press on Walking to their death Soon they'll be gone.  Encounters on the way are few An old man in a cloak of black "You would do well to hear me heroes, If your lives you value, go back."  But the heroes went on Ignoring the man they saw And reached their destination, Soon they'd meet fate's law.  They enter the ruins And their swords they draw For they see a figure ahead, The old man whom they saw.  "I warned you," said he, "But you ignored me." He starts to wave his hands, "Now true power you will see."  The cave is lit up The man's form begins to change, The cave closes behind And now the man looks strange.  He has been twisted by evil And his form is now true A demon stands before them A hero shouts, "I'll run you through!"  But no matter how hard they try All efforts are made in vain The hero's begin to fall The demon laughs at the pain.  And now it is done Ignoring warning was their flaw, The demon heads for the town All will soon fall to fate's law.
