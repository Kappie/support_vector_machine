But I told via an email. I should have told her face to face. What an idiot? Whenever i see her in school, I just freeze. I try to smile at her but it seems that she did not notice me. My love life is just crap. No one will ever like  me. I used to like another girl who was in the same Punjabi school as me but she has now migrated to Australia. What a waste? It is time to move on.  Anyway, today i went to look for a job with a fren of mine. Monday must go for interview. Damm scary. I will be going to Malaysia(Malacca) tommorrow for a religious program. I will be back on Saturday.
