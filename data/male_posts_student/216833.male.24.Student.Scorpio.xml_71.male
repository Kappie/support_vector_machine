It's been three weeks since the last squat or leg-press. I feel pretty drained. Last week, i just skipped wednesday in the gym - I think I was busy; but that was the only day missed.  I'm just screwing around at work uploading files to myplay.com - drawing - checking email and message boards. Not much going on, I set up a laptop for a guy, prepared the backups, and answered some calls about simple operational questions.   I drove by a Jack-n-the-Box and saw like this couple barly pull out of the drive thru and they are stuffing their face. Shit! Get the wrapper off first. Sooner or later someone is going to come out with this idea where people can ask for "Drive" instead of "To Go"   "Would you like that burger to Drive, Sir" "What's the...?" "We prepare the sandwich in the wrapper so you can DIVE right in. Would you like to me do that?" "Sure...I'm a fat lazy fucker - just calories I don't have to burn."  They would neatly fold the wrapper ready to take in hand and eat imediatly. That is just fucking lazy. If that ever happens, it would just be a perfect progression into the American dream. The president would endorse the new complementary Drive wrapper option.  I guess if it goes that far, they should just have people in the restroom to shake and wipe.  Oh well - I am going home tonight to prepare Thank you cards for all the lovely people that brought wedding gifts and helped out with the wedding. I am really glad all that went well.
