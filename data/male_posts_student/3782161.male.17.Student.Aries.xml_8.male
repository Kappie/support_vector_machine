Climbing on the way up,  Sizing up the competition,  waiting for the right time,  To strike a chord and change your life.   Don't you ever think for one-second that  i will forget the reasons that i cried.  You are no more potent than words that choke me  I sit and ask you two words.   But this is not a product,  and we're not in competition,  waiting for the right time,  to strike a chord and your life.   Regret's how i spell your name.  In light of what you have done.  How can you not feel the same?  My love will fade with the sun.  As days go by, shed a tear.  I hate your face more than life.  I'll fake a smile for (you) my dear.  So turn away.   Climbing on the way up,  Sizing up the competition,  Waiting for the right time,  To strike a chord and change your life.
