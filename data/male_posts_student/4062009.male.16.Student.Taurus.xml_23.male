However, other then then not much homework at all, it is still a busy task to remember all my classes work.  Anyway, I hope to get all my work organized this weekend. So I hope by then, things in school will be a bit easier. I can tell you this though, I am loving Math this year. My math teacher, G-Dog as she calls herself, rocks. And the class is loads of fun, that and the work is really easy. Anyway, got to run! Later!    Wolfwood
