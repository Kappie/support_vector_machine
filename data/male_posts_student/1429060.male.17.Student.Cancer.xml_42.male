Thanks to good sir Kevin who is willing to host us. Visit  urlLink The New and Improved Dream of You, now in technicolor!   Becky's commenting system is also working. Good positive happy optimistic glad enlightening buoyant etc...  School is hell as usual. My essays are dying at an exponential rate. And the apocalypse is about to come, and hell will freeze over. All thanks to the combination of biology essays on the plasma membrane, calculus tests on graph reflection, economics posters concerning supply and demand, and english assignments on John Calvin and the Puritans.  Dying softly now.  Good day, mortals. Cheers.
