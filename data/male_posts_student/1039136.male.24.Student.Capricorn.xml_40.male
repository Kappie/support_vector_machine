At the end of the movie, from the theater arose an almost anonymous applause by the audience.  That many solid Democrats? Highly doubt it!  I'm a Democrat, I've shared in the anti-Bush sentiment since the beginning of his term.  I wasn't full behind Al Gore, but since I was a registered Democrat, I cast my vote for him.  I was disheartened about the election controversy, and the fact that my first voting experience for a Presidential election ended mixed a scandal which selected the other candidate to be our four year leader.  That's fine though, what's done is done. Although I had not supported Bush at all, I've always made an attempt to understand his role as a politician, and the highest ranking Government official.  I understand how there are conflicting interests and choices have to be made, information has to be withheld, and sometimes even facts have to be skewed in order to keep a peaceful democratic nation.   Publically however, I do believe our President has made mistakes that have hurt the Country, that has taken money from our pockets, our friends and family out of their homes, and freedom away from our lives.  Fahrenheit 9/11 however wasn't for me in the sense that this movie, as I see it, is to create a balance. There are hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of people who are undecided about the upcoming election and don't know what to believe.  Fahrenheit 9/11 flat out is propaganda based.  It doesnt tell the whole story, and certainly doesn't give you every angle. THATS FINE.  I'm not an avid Kerry supporter, and I certainly wouldn't take a million dollars in exchange for voting for Bush.  Fahrenheit did what it needed to do, it leveled out the see saw of politics for the upcoming election.  As sad as it may be, most people like to think what they are told to. Whoever bullshits the best to these people gets the vote.  The Bush Administration has taken some extremely large hits due to the investigations, and overall Bush being Bush. Bush's main way to retaliate, is to hit Kerry strong whichever way he can, and to put out as much political bullshit as possible so that he can avert the minds of voters from the turmoil that has occurred over the last 3 and a half years.  He's going to do whatever possible to distract the voters and cover his ass in the lies.  You've seen resignations by directors and high ranking officials, and don't be fooled. Most of those are because, Bush overall will not take the man's way out of dealing with his screw ups, because frankly who is going to vote for a fuck up President?  Bush instead will find a way to shift the blame to one department or another, saying he didn't get the correct information and he acted appropriately.  So here you have the current President of the United States, with a whole team of people to write his lies for him.  Kerry has a team to, but when the GW fuckups are playing in the superbowl against the Kerry team, who do you think has the edge? It's common sense.    In comes Michael Moore, director.  The most i've known about Michael Moore previous to Fahrenheit was that he's that fat dorky guy.  I didn't see "Bowling for Columbine" and had no idea what his political affiliations were. I am extremely happy that someone stepped out and attempted to even the odds for Kerry. That's exactly what this movie is doing. It's reaching out to us, the little people. The people who have been effected personally, emotionally, and monetarily by the past 3 and a half years. He's touching the people who don't have business interests or aren't going to be swayed by promises or bargains with our corporation for support.  Instead, Moore appeals to our human emotions. The other side of the story is shown. I call it propaganda because it's a one sided attack on Bush, and supports Kerry without even mentioning his name.  Perhaps I should say the underlying theme of this movie is "Get Bush Out of Office."  Never is it mentioned that Kerry is the ideal candidate like in the political ads.  However, if people don't vote for Bush, theyre not going to vote for some random independent candidate!!!    What's important about this film, about the political ads, about everything from now until the election, is that we think independently; That we decide whether or not to exercise our right to vote on our own; That if we DO decide to vote, we choose whomever we feel should be President.  We need to think independently. We should not let a movie, an ad, a tv interview, or a letter or email tell us what to do. In America, we're allowed to think and reason, let's do it.  Filter through all the bullshit and all the propaganda.  Don't be a beach ball bounced around by the press! We need to use our personal experiences and thoughts be a meter. We need to think back to 9/11, and over the rest of the last three years, when we choose to vote for someone, or not vote at all    I'm solid against Republicans in office.  I don't have a billion political reasons, and accounts and facts and figures to back up why.  Plain and simple, i'm your everyday person.  I watch the news on and off, I catch some things in the paper, but most importantly, like every other average Joe, i'm affected by my day to day personal interactions the most.  I'm affected by the people I work with, the people I speak to, and the rules, regulations and policies that deal with everyday life. I am a solid Democrat because, simply, I feel that when Bill Clinton was in office, his role as a leader from the business side was inspiring.  I saw money in my pocket, I saw the little guy start to make big money, and i've seen technology and innovation like never before. I saw life overall getting better.  Through the entire war, i've sort of had an external participation in the feelings related.  During the time the infamous 9/11 occurred, I was working as a telemarkenting mentor for the home improvement company, Pennsylvania Resources.  A portion of my job was to make outbound telemarketing calls to procure leads for salesmen, and the other portion was to monitor our callers to ensure compliance to rules and suggest ways to improve. That day on 9/11 we were calling the Pittsburgh area, as PA resources served that market as well as the Harrisburg, Williamsport, and Local Northeast PA. Around 9am, the staff was given their first break. We were having a slow day, so they asked me to go on the phones and get some leads.  I remember putting a lead up on the board, and a coworker from the Data Entry department in hysterics that the country was being attacked. The initial reaction from everyone, the supervisors, was disbelief, and that the plane hitting the trade center was a mistake.    So back to the phones we went, calling the Pittsburgh area, when around the same time the plane hit.  The last woman I spoke to asked me if I had the news on.  "Of course not, I'm on the phone working mam."  "The world is ending," she said. At that point, the entire marketing section of thirty or so people seemed to get the same sort of call, and put down their headsets.  Most of them were elderly people, some from the New York area, and a fear overcame everyone.  The call center was closed right there, and I can remember driving home, looking up at the sky, I think everyone was. One had to sit and wonder, what's next. I think I said a prayer that day, and I don't often do that.  It's no doubt that 9/11 affected all of us. We were all scared, angry, and in awe at that time.  America wasn't going to let this slip, not one bit, and I think on 9/11, one of the reasons we were scared is that we knew it was likely that we something big was going to happen involving our troops.   The first person that came to mind was one of my best friends, Ray.  He just got out of the Marines and was enjoying civilian life.  Would he have to go back?  I know he got aggrivated at the time when people consistently asked him if he would have to go, but I think it's a natural reaction to think oh shit, what if.  What if Ray still had that urge in him to be a Marine...What if they called him and convinced him to go?  As the efforts to start the "WAR ON TERROR" intensified, images of buildings blowing up, fires, smoke, and trails of bombs in the night sky filled the TV.  At this point, the feeling of security sort of came back for us.  There are a very few percentage of people who didnt look at the TV and say, "yeah lets get those fuckers."  We had our military efforts in Afghanistan, even though most of that was kept under wraps.  Then of course, everything shifted to Iraq.  We have all had a sentiment against Iraq from the Gulf War continuing through the present.  We attacked Iraq, and we had that "the good guys win" attitude, but yet didn't take into consideration that to some in Iraq, we weren't the good guys. I remember being in sixth grade, when the first Bush was in office. Our teachers had us making American flags, and there were trading cards out of the troops and artillery. How could we NOT be anti-Iraq?! However, to some overseas, we aren't at all the good guys, and to some at home, we sure as hell didnt win.   As we know with every war, civilian casualties are an issue.  It's an assumed risk sadly. Innocent people in Iraq died, just as innocent people in America died during the 9/11 attacks. It's a sad thing really, because life is precious, let it be an Iraqi's life or an American's life.  We are civillians because we make that choice to be, just as Iraqi civillians do.    We are sort of disconnected from the civillian deaths in Iraq though.  We feel bad, but we don't really let it sink in, because our hand are tied.  Some of us would rather have a million "Enemy" civillians die, than one of our own.   I've come across several people involved in this military mess.  An ex girlfriend of mine, Amy, had an ex-fiancee and two brothers in the military.  I've seen much of what she went through. When shit was blowing up in Iraq, her and her mother and brother who was out of the service would sit and watch the tv, speak to family members and really hurt, because people they loved were over there. I'm lucky enough to not have had to go through that personally, but second hand was pretty scary too.  Aside from Amy, I met a kid named Mike who was going to Iraq, and a friend of my cousins was one of the first to invade Iraq.  An old friend of mine from wrestling was also a Marine. It's amazing that so far, knock on wood, they all came back alive.  During that time I wondered what it would be like if someone i knew died.  What were they dying for anyway?  Basically, when youre at war, you fight to stay alive. Kill or be killed, but on either side, someones going to lose and someone is going to hurt. It's a scary scary thought, we all know at some point our luck will be up. I thought about how difficult it must be to barely know what your son, friend or family memeber, was doing. Is he alive and when is he coming home. I've seen Amy wait and wait and wait for her brother to come back. When these troops do come back, it's not your typical "I missed you celebration." This kind of return is more of a THANK GOD YOU'RE ALIVE celebration.  I've seen war from that aspect, and it's insanely scary.  Now, we're faced with a decision in a few months, and those are some of the experiences and feelings i'm going to take into consideration IF I vote. If I don't vote, will it really matter? Will Kerry do a good job if he gets re-elected? What will happen if Bush remains in office? These are questions I ask myself on a regular basis.  I look around at the things that affect me, I look at the people around me as well and the things that politics and the Country's leadership is having an effect on.    Overall, the point of all this is to keep your eyes open, and throw your X-Ray goggles on too. Don't believe everything you see, don't believe everything you hear, and sure as hell don't be afraid to think for yourself.  We are the people in the next few months that will defined the Country for the NEXT four years.  Don't let me sway you, don't let Michael Moore sway you, you think about you and your personal experiences.  Go see Fahrenheit, but just as you would with campaign ads, take it all with a grain of salt. Be proud to be human, be happy you have free will and dont let anyone or anything take that away from you. Finally, don't ever forget, this is America, this is your Country.  Just as I have had a chance to have my say in this post, you have your chance to have your say too. Don't be afraid to speak up!
