One part thrashy guitar, one part harmonious guitar, one part brutal drums, one part thunderous bass, one part melodic keyboard, and one part scratchy vocals all come together to make a style that is greatly under-appreciated.    Kalmah , hailing from Finland, is no different. They follow this formula, but add their own self-dubbed "swampy" touch. Their first album,  Swamplord  exhibits their masterful musicianship. Antti Kokko's melodic guitar is first and foremost the highlight of this band. Many times, Antti's guitar licks are somewhat soothing while his brother Pekka's rhythm guitar blugeon the ears. This dynamic of grace and rage works astoundingly well.    Swamplord  starts off with "Evil in You", a speedy number that never lets up. The highlight of this song is towards the end where Antti's lead guitar repeats the most beautiful harmony on the album. At the very end, there is an interesting twist as a funeral organ closes out the song.   "Withering Away" is a song with a wonderful intro and a speedy tempo. This may, however, be the weakest song on the album.   Pasi Hiltula's keyboards and Antti Kokko's guitar shine on "Heritance of Berija". Everything on this track from the first note to the last note is simply majestic. Towards the beginning, there is a keyboard line that sounds like a violin. This touch to the song is spot on. Antti Kokko's leads are absolutely superb. There is another keyboard solo in the middle of the song that bridges the verse to the guitar solo. This guitar solo is the best on the whole CD. In the second half of the solo, the keyboard and the lead guitar harmonise creating a fantastic dynamic.   The atmosphere is heightened in "Black Roija" as the keyboard, Antti Kokko's lead guitar, and Pekka Kokko's rhythm guitar blend to add a mysterious and swampy feeling. The guitar solo has the feeling of a cold, dark alley in the summer night. This is yet another strong track.   The single to  Swamplord  is "Dance of the Water". This song opens with a eerie, cold keyboard intro. Ominous guitars enter and transition into another fabulous Antti Kokko guitar solo. The verse and chorus is different from the other songs as there are no harmonies or melodies. The lyrics portray an interesting picture to those who have the lyrics or those who can somehow understand the vocals. There is another excellent solo towards the end, which leads to a great harmony to close out the song.   "Hades" starts out with a lead that sounds like it came from a pirate movie for some reason. After the momentary break in the song, there is crushing drums and rhythm guitar, but a delicate little melody from the lead guitar and keyboard. The lead guitar offers many wonderful sharp screeches throughout the song that will kill little doggies. The overall atmosphere is somewhat laid back. This is the most evident in the instrumental break where one of the catchiest melodies lie. It's off to a full speed solo after that which transitions back into the catchy melody.   A keyboard intro that sounds like an instrument I have never heard opens "Alteration". There is another superb melody in the beginning of the song. The best part of this song is the instrumental break that takes one melody and repeats it in different ways that eventually leads into a great solo. The general atmosphere of the instrumental break is outright supernatural. Yet another wonderful song.   "Using the Word" starts out immediately after "Alteration". At first I thought they were one long song, but much to my surprise, they were two. The main lead gives a strong, triumphant feel. The keyboard adds in a harp melody that adds just the right flavour to this track. Another crafty instrumental break as both Kokko brothers offer a solo. Both are wonderfully done and add just the right atmosphere to the song. Great use of the whammy bar is also included. The track finishes strong and Pekka gives a nice ending to the album with a great raspy yell... then spits into the microphone.   However, there are some critical downsides in the production department. First of all, the bass drum can hardly be heard. The double bass drumming is great in "Evil in You", but it takes a lot of effort to hear it. Another problem is the keyboards are unnoticeable.  Kalmah 's music concentrates on the atmosphere and mood and the keyboard provides most of it. However, it is missing for large portions in most songs. It is only noticeable in the solos and in parts of "Evil in You" and "Using the Word", but just barely. And finally, the bass is non-existent. It simply cannot be heard in any of the songs, except for the intro of "Evil in You" and the interlude in "Hades".    Swampsong , musically, is a spectacular mix of driving rhythm guitar with elegant lead guitar. The mood and feeling is a concentrated theme that this band has to offer. If  Kalmah  can improve their production, perfection will be within reach.
