[2x]  Your truly the best,a bless, the greatest girl i know, you made my life worth living, baby and it shows. I want to have you c loser to me, to feel happly home. i want to promise that i'll never leave you alone.  For one thing i'm really sure for you my love has no way? And nothing in this world can separate us, So until then  [refrain]  Not a day go by that I don't think of you. Sitting here contemplating will my dreams come true. No one is perfect in life, but you're so perfect for me. I can't describe how your love sets me free. My life won't be okay until you're by my side. Without you i'd be empty,so be my bride!  [refrain]  Will you marry me? By your side i'll be. Will you marry me? By your side i'll be!  For one thing i'm really sure for you my love has no way? And nothing in this world can separate us, So until then  [refrain]
