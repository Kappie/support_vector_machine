Anyway, last friday night.Myself and a few chosen others went drinking up Chapel Field. or planned to anyway. Just before we got there, I got a call (on my brand new mobile! whoo! it has a camera!) from will saying that the police were confiscating all the drinks they find on underage people around Chapel field. After a quick conference we decided, fuck it. Well they did. I wanted to go round the field, but OH NO. Anyway to cut a long story short. there were no cops. We got nicely pissed. then played on a dance mat.    Guess who won! thats right! it wasn't me. Matt won instead. But I reckon I won the Tekken fights (Yes Tekken 1) anyway. Twas good fun. and I found out some interesting information about Hayley. Which is private. Away you dogs! *Staves off wth stick*
