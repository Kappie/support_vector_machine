In fact, my profile pic is just that; including the one on  urlLink Chess-Live   Anyways, I'm thinking about starting all over again.    What's weird about that game, you ask?  I'll tell you what's weird: there's gotta be a sequel. There are so many questions unanswered that I'm baffled. Here's what I could come up with in a 10 minute time frame:  What happens to the villagers? What's the thing with Garet's arm at the end? He said he felt something but it wasn't really anything. Maybe we'll find out IN THE SEQUEL *nudges Camelot and Nintendo* Why does the Wise One say "Maybe we'll meet again some day" to the doomed Alex? Why does the Wise One send in the three-headed dragon that is actually Isaac's kidnapped dad and Jenna's kidnapped parents? What happens to Alex? What happens to the ship Isaac got from Lalivero? What was the Wise One's true intentions? He says "You have learned too much" and tries to kill Isaac and friends. Why is the top of Mt. Aelph still sticking above ground if it's supposed to have the doomed Alex bound to the top and have it sinking? If the Wise One can't interfere with the actions of mankind, then why does he bind Alex to the peak of Mt. Aelph? If the Wise One can't interfere with the actions of mankind, then why does he send a three-headed dragon to the aerie of the Mars Lighthouse?  Well, I guess that can all be explained in the sequel. "Golden Sun: Return of Alex" or something.  That game is awesome. I'll see if I can come up with an explanation for you guys within the next couple of days.
