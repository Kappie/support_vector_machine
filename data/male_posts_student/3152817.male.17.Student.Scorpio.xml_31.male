All liberal protest cries aside, Where are the WMDs?  The way I see it, there are three possibilities.    1. Iraq really did destroy them.   The problem with this is that they’ve never been able to show proof that the weapons have been destroyed.  Did they pull an Enron and destroy the records along with the weapons?  Not likely.    2. Saddam ordered the weapons to be moved out of the country before the war started.   While we wasted our time trying to convince the world that Saddam was an evil tyrant who, for the sake of the Iraqi people and the world as a whole, deserved to be removed from power, Iraq could have moved its weapons into Syria or Iran.    3. The weapons were sold to terrorists.   This is really the worst case scenario.  It’s public knowledge that Saddam promises 25,000 dollars (US) to the families of Hamas suicide bombers.  Since Hamas is a terrorist organization, and Saddam gives them money, is it not obvious that Saddam supports terrorism?    It’s blatantly obvious that Saddam was an evil man.  He used chemical weapons on his own people and against Iranians.  His torture chambers and rape rooms were always occupied by political dissidents.   He invaded another sovereign country (Kuwait) and planned on the invasion of another (Saudi Arabia).  He has violated nearly all of the restrictions placed on him by UN resolutions and the Cease Fire agreement with the US.  Being in violation of international law and countless UN resolutions, the US would have been in dereliction of duty as a member of the international community had we NOT removed this despot from power.  Even with all these perfectly good reasons to end Saddam’s evil rule, liberals continue to accuse the Bush Administration of starting a war for oil.    The simple fact is, we wouldn’t have needed to go to war to get Iraq’s oil.  All we needed to do was ask the UN for it.  Heck, France and Germany have been getting it for years by going behind the back of the UN sanctions.  Why shed the blood of  900 Americans for something that could have been obtained diplomatically?   The debate over the war really comes down to this.   Is the United States safer now that  Saddam Hussein’s evil regime is being replaced with democracy in Iraq?   I think the answer is a resounding  yes .      More on this topic to come…
