It talkz about how boyz vball is growin and how its gettin better, but it still has itz weaknesses, like tryin to find ppl who actually wanna play the sport. Also it talkz about how we're favoritez to win CIF this year and about playerz gettin into Div. 1 or 2 collegez. Well all i can say is that year i guess our sport is gettin more exposure cuz of the attendence at gamez now, but it still needz a lot of work, like a program at middle schoolz and stuff. And about us winning CIF, i know we can do it but we jus got to get focused when it comez to big gamez and jus take em early and maintain our intensity throughout the whole match. And about gettin into a Div.1 or 2 school, i really wanna play in college and i wanna play at someplace here. I know i have the ability to get into a top school but i jus dont get enuff exposure and scoutz lookin at me and stuff, but im doin my best to try to get a full ride to some school, my backup right now is emmanuel, but i wanna go to a D. 1 school. So if we win CIF maybe i might jus get a chance to get into one of those colleges...worrrrd. Hopefully that will happen...later dayz.
