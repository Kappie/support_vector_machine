Basicly I gave him his 40 dollars, and he gives me a cheque for 40 dollars (hehe a cash advance) but anyway he said "well my mom wants to go, do you want me to come in or something?" and I said "ahh you dont have too" and I said bye, he did too. Not too friendly, but very upsetting nontheless. I actually cried afterwards.. first time in a long time. But he will be back before long..at least I hope so. He says he will stay 6 months, possibly a year. He said that he wouldn't stay longer than a year-but if it goes over 6 months..hes staying there permenently k? For those who don't know, dave is a very good friend of mine-we have known each other since november/2001.  Not a long time in your books? too bad it was a big deal. And if it wasn't that long of a friendship, this 6-12 month thing is obviously a big issue.  The funny thing is, I've known him much longer when I was not going to his school..I moved to Surrey in April/02. Just a few months after we met. He will still be my friend, online and on the phone. The difference between me moving to surrey from qualicum and him moving from qualicum to kitchener is about 5 thousand kilometres. Thats the difference between driving distance and well, i dont think my dad would let me drive across the country. so i'm pretty depressed right now, and i'm also tired because i didn't sleep last night. oh well.
