Um, hmmm, where should i start....um, i juss came back from school, after my APE test today...things went pretty smoothly, just glad it's finally over.  um....hmmm, shit, lol, i can;t think of anything to write!  Um, well, after test, we went down to go eat some burgers down at wendy's and stuff.  I told the guys that usually go to luch with me that i could drive them there, but not bring them back.  I think rob of all people got mad, and i think the others were kinda dissapointed.  But they gotta realize i can;t be driving them everywhere.  Know yes, i know rob's parents always gave us, paticualrly me a ride when i needed it, and i'm very thankful for that, BUT, i'm not paying for my own gas, for my own car, and i acutally apprciate the way my family makes there living, so i'm not fucking gonna go everywhere dropping people off.  I'll only do it when were car pooling, and sometimes not even then.   ok, now that that's off my back....um, yea, everyone seems to be together these days. Maybe it's cause it's spring, but i don't know.  So far, i've stated that MAD random shit is happening, and that still holds true.  Andy found someone, which is awsome, and jorge is still with Judith.  Um....fuck, forget about it, i ran out of a list of names....but ya know whats funny?  As random as this appearce to me, i'm sure my freinds are gonna say the same thing to me.  The last time they saw me go out with someone was in 9th grade!  9TH GRADE!! , so yeah.  Um.....what else.  Ya, whatever, i'm not even sweating it anymore.  Like, i belive there someone for someone else, like, there ALWAYS that "perfect" match for someone esle.  Dosn't mean your gonna meet em, but they do exist...so ya, thats my excuse.  Like, acouple of weeks ago i was talking to steph, and during that convo, i realized my problem.  I don't go after anyone i like.  Like , i try, but definitly not like i should.  But it's hard.  Like, Andy, i know, worked to get with his girl.  Like, he even told me, he;s commited and shit.  And look at them now! like, for me, i just expect everything to happen the way it did in 9th grade...cause like, that way was fucking awsome.  But now that i realize it, i got there cause i worked to get to that level in a relationship.  I dunno, i juss gotta get out there, and meet new people.  I'm not gonna try out my new tactic at antioch cause frankly, i don't really like the girls there. (no offense by the way).  They prolly don't like me either, but hey, what am i gonna do, right?  Well, ya, i'll prolly try becoming better freinds WITH the people at antioch, and maybe they can introduce me to some of their freinds or something.  And only 2 people i would even think about having a relationship at antioch is michelle, ane possibly mary...but not even, ya know? (to anyone who isn't in antioch, sorry)  SPEAKING of antioch, i read jones' blog, and even though he said i don't have to, i'll say it anyway, sorry man,  This is how it went down.   That day was SAT's, and yes, jones' DID remind me.  BUT, the d game was at night, so i was MADD bored, and needed something to do. Saw jorge was online, asked him if he was free.  He was, and we decided we were gonna jam (i do play guitar ya know..), but we needed a place to do it.  Well, hernie is are go to guy in those situations, so we called him.  he said it was cool, i packed all my shit up, and headed over.  When i got there, turns out it wasn't just gonna be us three.  It was me, jorge, dorian, that kid julian that lives next door to dorian, Jaquan (not ninja turtle), and like always, Hernie's little brother was chillen too.  So we played Gamecube for a while, and that lasted, like....had to be 2-3 hours.  Well, by that time, me and jorge went down stairs, cause we wanted to jam.  We played alittle bit, but then benny called.  I then remebered about d and d! i was like, o shit.  So we tell him whats up and we said well call him back.  By that time, jorge's parents were like "let's go mini-golfing" so we were gonna go there, but i totally forgot.  Well, anyway, i still really wanted to play guitar..but D was in the back of my head.  By this time, i think it was hernie's uncle(?) that called, to have us over to eat some BBQ...well, i definitly didn't want to go to that, not cause i don't like them, but, i don't know, i guess i was juss tired of being there, so i decided to bounce.  I told them to call me when they were leaving for golfing.  Well, i went back home, and pretty much stayed there for the rest of the night.  I didn't wanna call up the guys at d and d, cause first of all, i had NO idea where they were, and second, i was..i dunno, the only way i could describe it was....depressed? like, not emotionally, but phsyically, i just didn;t want to move.  And, ya, i didn't go to golfing for that same reason....+ i had no money.  So there ya go, thats the story of that  Antioch yesterday was less-than average.  I mean, people  showed up, and it was cool, but sometimes you juss gotta have certain people to srpuce things up.  Rob, Scott, Michelle, Andy, (well, he was there, but not "THERE"), Mike....etc etc.  It was ok none the less.  Vinny gave a talk about Past, present and future and shit, and thats about it.  That reminded though of my first talk, the one about love...ya, everyone saying how good it was and shit was really cool......memories......ya, i guess another thing to mention  about antioch was me trying to sing.  The girls on the other side of the circle were singing "lean On Me", and i jumped in, and we were  all singing it, mad cool....and even though i sounded bad, i still had fun   Um, shit, what else, what else....o yeah, SAT's...i think i did decent, hopefully better than the PSAT's..(like 780...:o()  I fucked up on my section 5 though.  Like, it was a buncha problems i knew i could do, but since i was taking the long was, cause it was the only way i remember, i was taking way to long, and  next thing i knew, time was up, and i had like 12 blank! i was like, o shit! so i guessed about 5, and left the others fre...i dun think it was twelve, maybe it was like, 10, but w/e....i hope i did good.    Omg, lemme juss say one thing....some people can;t get over shit.  lemme explain...I, like most people when there bored on aim, scavange the names on the list, and view other's Away messages.  If they have AIM, and a profile, you can see those too....now, i did such a thing, when i stumbled on sheel's...turns out she has a blog....enough said.  I'm a bore guy....so i want to get entertained, but this shit is SICK.  Now, like, i understand she had feelings for him and what not, thats very understandable, but holy shit!  she's gotta except the fact that it's over.  there's ALOT more fish in the sea, ALOT ALOT ALOT more.....i think she has the same problem i do, she doesn't TRY.....but ya, no offense to sheel or whoever knows her thats reading this.  I'm not calling her a mental case, i'm juss saying shit like that is unhealty, she's juss gotta move on.  And whats this shit about dan only wanted her to fuck?? thats some mother fucking  BULLSHIT .  Now...shit, i can't talk for dan, i don't know what his intentions were, but from what i know, i think i can say, that when u go out with a person for MORE than a year, it's expected that you too have atleast had sex one.  And no, i'm not saying thats the rule, i'm saying thats what usually happens WHEN YOUR TOGETHER THAT LONG.  IT TENDS TO HAPPEN.  If dan did try to get you to do it, you know what that means? That means he prolly likes you ALOT, no, no, wait, scratch that,  LOVES  you alot.  And whats a synnonym of Fucking, sex, Horizontal tango?   MAKING LOVE .  I mean, sheesh.  And then you start rying and shit, PLEASE. Actions speak louder than words.  By saying no, i mean, shit, it's like, you don't want him to share the love he has for you, with you.  Now, if your scared of penis' that a different story, BUT COME ON NOW....ok, enough ranting about that....i juss had to get that shit out, ya know? If your reading this, sheel, there ya go, u got my side of things.  Still gotta get my tux for prom....T minus 17 days left....i'm excited! can;t wait to see what happens!!  hopefully i get a nice tux, but well see   ok...thats about it, i got nothing left.....i'm definitly gonna head to the gym today, and then prolly sleep.....i MIGHT update this shit, but most likely not....
