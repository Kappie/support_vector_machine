I felt confindent and take it with open hands! Hahaha! As I thought the oral would be damn hard.. I was wrong! It's easy!!! Hahahaha!! So I really do hope I got good grades for my oral.. Hoping for a distinction! *BleakZ*!! Hahaha!  7.05am.. I waited and waited.. For her arrival.. She did arrive though.. She's looking darn cute man.. It's been a while since we talked to each other and we're like talking all the way to school! She even gave me her Band Promotion Day photo. It's nice of her.. Love you sweetie!! Hehehe! Walked together to school.. I'm like so into her.. She's like the one for me.. And I guess ya'll know whom right? The girl I'm talking about is Jennifer.. YeAh! She's one cool chick man! She messaged me before the orals wishing 'Good Luck'.. That's so sweet of her.. I love you Jennifer.!!!   In school today.. Mas gave a speech on 'Dreams'! Hahaha! He's kinda nervous and even before the speech he rushed to copy back his speech on my foolscap paper.. After the flag-raising ceremony.. He rushed to the back of the SC (Jayne) and threw MY foolscap paper into the soil..   -.-! Thanks Mas!! Hahaha! No matter... Had PE.. After school went to eat lunch.. That's when  Jenni   smsed me.. She's sweet man.. I felt very darn lucky to have her.. Hehehe! Had my oral and went home in the drizzling rain.. *SiGhZz* Tired and exhausted..   Peace Out!!!
