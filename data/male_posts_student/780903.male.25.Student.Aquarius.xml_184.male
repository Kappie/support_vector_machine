My favorite part -- at the end of each chapter there's 10 pages of questions and answers.  I'm sure they're useful, but for my purposes right now I'm skipping over them, and I'll probably go back to them closer to the exam, to make sure I can answer them quickly and accurately -- so it makes the page numbers go up nice and quickly.  4-page chapters with 10 pages of q are especially rewarding.
