We were at John's house, apparently doing nothing but acting stupid:         I don't know what Stuart was doing here; I think he had a high fever with an acute case of idiot, and thus the forehead contact and retard-expression.         I, being the normal person that I am, was playing an F chord on the guitar. Ben, on the other hand, was pretending to kill space zombies through his "virtual-reality module," which was actually a pair of ear muffs.         Do I even need to explain this one? Lovely, isn't it...?     And, just to prove that I really have fried my brain cells:       This is Stuart without his medication.   That's enough mayhem for today. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go study for the test I'm going to inevitably fail. So long.
