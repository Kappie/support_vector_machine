NO NEVER.........so what am i supposed to do now? am i just supposed to sit here and let you take the flak from the ppl that have a wrong view of who i am, b/c they dont really know me and they dont want to get to know me either? i dont know anymore...i dont know anything anymore..im not a victim! im a miner who has dug a hole so deep that i cant get out--but i have to ask myself what is the hole?? is it my own fault people think these things of me? maybe its the way i dress...the way i talk...the way i present myself. do i really have to figure all of this out AGAIN? please just tell me you'll be with me no matter the shit you'll get from judgemental people..and just tell me that you dont want me to change--b/c im in that state of "conformity" once again, where ill change to get people to like me and stop thinking bad things about me. but im sick of changing--i cant do it anymore you guys. its just too much to handle, too much work, and in the end....i just have to change again, b/c i meet new people, and they want me to be something different. but am i ok? God loves me for who i am, so why cant everyone else? i stress: if God loves me for me, and doesnt want me to change, then why does everyone else????  p.s.--i dunno if im going to be posting for a while or not? its not like anyone reads this thing i guess..they never leave comments. if i dont post for a while, im still alive just to let you know.
