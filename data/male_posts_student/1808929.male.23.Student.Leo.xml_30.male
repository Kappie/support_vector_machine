It was alright, but I'm still trying to recooperate from it. So yeah, this morning I took my G.I. exam and I've just been vegging since then.  ..... OK, I think I'm too tired to really write paragraphs with a complete thought anymore, so I'm just going to write random stuff. This thursday I'm planning on going to see that movie the Passion of the Christ with a few people. Spring break is 2 weeks away. I'm really stoked about these new tablet PC's that they have. I'm hoping that my next computer will be one.  I only saw about 20 minutes of the Oscars, but I did get to see Jack Black and Will Farrell's duet. It's soooo hot right now. Later!
