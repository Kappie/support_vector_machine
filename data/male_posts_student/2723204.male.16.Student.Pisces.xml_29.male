Jurong East there, but very tired lol, got slide all, then got wave pool, actually, it was a very memorable thing. My first time swimming with them 6. Got a sunburn the next day, but it was all worth it lol. Of all people now, i feel closest to these 6. Actually had a wonderful week with them. My pocket's empty cos' of all the birthdays. Stella's next in April, then its Chin han and pris in september/october. March is really the most hiong one, cos' there's ben,me, XY and Woon han. Wah stella ah, very hiong man........yesterday talking to her on MSN then say something wrong, then she go offline liao, SMS her, dunwant to reply, sui man...........  XY birthday she very busy sia, her birthday still mus mop floor, cook the food, clear the plate, that's why, haiz, then Kenneth also very hao lian, cannot stand him man, cocky and immature. That time we all went to buy XY gift, the lingerie, only me and han only guys sia. Ben and Chin han, dunnoe why, go off liao. We all very gang ga, but my idea lah that one, cannot blame. Yesterday night, i watching all the video, memories man, Chin han take one, got Ben's birthday and mine. Woon Han's birthday, we all bought the Smap's MIJ and hagen daz cake, on XY birthday actually, of we all 4 so far, spend the most sia........wah lau.........but sui, i like this feeling of being broke because of our birthdays, must get used to it every march man.   School homework also got alot, i must now go chiong man, do almost half liao, now I go do geog. But really, this week also suopposed to go watch the LOTR exhibition at the science centre, but all no money, 20 bucks sia the ticket, i think we all go Jurong east there swim more fun, cheaper some more 2.80 plus float, can go there relax, budden sure sunburn one.
