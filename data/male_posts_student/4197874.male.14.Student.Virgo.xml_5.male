Well i read more though ^_^ i got about a fourth of the way through the first book and my goal is to finish the book before 5:00pm tomorrow. and tomorrow at 1:00 i have to get my hair cut T__T i love my hair you can't let them do it and the worst part is that it will be some creepy person i have never met. >      Well on Gaia i was thinking about making my own Charity but then i realized how many new ones there are and that i would just be one of those ones that was ignored so i didn't want to make one. And plus if i did end up making one it wouldn't feel right.. i mean i would have to stay in there a lot and not be able to go to a lot of places and spend my time there ^-^;; so i guess it was just a bad idea i guess once i feel like i want to make on then i will... but who knows when that is >
