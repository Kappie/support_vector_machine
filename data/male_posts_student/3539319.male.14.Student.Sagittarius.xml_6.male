Tehn they dropped me off at Aubry's house for the party. I forgot my bathing suit so i used josh's shorts lol. and it fit like a speedo. then we went back down in the basement and had a candy fight. we threw candy and shit at eachother for about a half hour. then we laid dwn until we had to go home. we walked all the way home with my guitar! and it was semi wet but nothing harmful. i got home and my cuzins were over so we watched the calgary game and played cardsand then thats it i went to sleep.
