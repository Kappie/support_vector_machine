I will try to update that continuously as they change, but i think for the moment, they are set.  well i volunteered today.... boring as usual, but all the people left at about 12, so i sat around and played computer games till about 12:45 or so... then i went outside and waited for amber. Me, Jacob, Amber, Kim, and another guy who's name escapes me went out to eat in norman. it was interesting, heard some weird stories, met some people. but the thing was that there were 5 people in a camaro, if i had know that i would be packed in a car Asian style, i would have dressed for the occasion... but i was in long pants... and it was 100 degrees outside, and i had to sit on this really uncomfortable hump in the back seat... overall it was fun. yea, well i got dropped off first, and i always love the reaction of people seeing my house and my neighborhood for the first time. that's always fun!   so.... my personal deadline for finishing the Iliad didnt work out so well, so i am just gonna try to finish it either tomorrow, or sometime this weekend.
