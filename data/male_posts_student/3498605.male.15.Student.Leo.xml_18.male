I started getting tired around 11:30pm so I took a Mountain Dew Amp, and man does that wake you up fast. Anyways, I haven't been playing my best because my mind has been a little distracted on a question that can't be answered, regardless, we are still kicking some serious ass. Actually, we have only stopped playing Halo for about 30min when we went up to Luke's for dinner. Actually, the Amp is really making me feel weird. CRAP! now I have a headache because of the Amp and the damn question. Oh well, maybe more Halo, plus some advil will fix it. YAY! someone just joined my game so I'll post more later.  later, bradleyJ
