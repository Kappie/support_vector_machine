There are also a few that I am glad to see go. But there some people I want to stay. Some that I think that I have built up a relationship with just a tiny bit. I will let those people know who they are before they have a chance to go.  My sister is also a senior this year. She is going to go to ISU (Iowa State University) and become an engineer of some sort. Then I will have the computer all to myself!!!  One more thing before I go...I wonder if there will be any "super seniors" coming back for next year!!!  *Congratulations senior class of 2004*
