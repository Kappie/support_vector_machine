Then during 4th hour in science, Ms. Wells is leaving today b/c she is an intern and we had a party for her. I brought in chocolate suckers and every 1 loved them! All we did is hang out. After lunch I went to the Volunteers of America thank you party and we had food and we got really tight hats! AND WE'RE GOIN TO BE ON THE NEWS!!!! (FOX47) IT WAS AN AWESOME DAY!! I'm stuffed b/c I've been eating all day. It was really fun.
