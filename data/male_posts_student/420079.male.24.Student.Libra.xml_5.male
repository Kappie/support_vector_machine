So, alas, I think I'll have to forego the cardio today, unless I can do it tonight when I get back to Southfield. We'll see.  *** Addendum: Decided to go see Daredevil instead of getting home early enough to exercise. Great movie! Critics know nothing! Oh, and I didn't get any popcorn... but did have a couple Mountain Dews to stay awake.  :-)  It's okay, I still have a calorie deficit for the day, though pretty low protein (~65g... Must make up for it tomorrow.      Today's Meals    Scrambled eggs, toast 6" Turkey sub Mint mocha w/ skim milk 6" Turkey sub 40 oz of Mountain Dew Late-night munching (turkey breast, a buffalo wing)
