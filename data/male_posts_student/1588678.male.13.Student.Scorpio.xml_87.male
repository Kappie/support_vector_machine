Teacher: Which one of these papers is yours? You: The one that says "Bad Mother Fucker" on it.  Preacher: What's your favorite bible entry? You: Ezekiel 25:17, the path of the righteous man . . .   Boss: I’m sorry, but I’ll have to fire you. You: You dick!  Your Local McDonalds Employee: And what would you like today, sir? You: How about a, “Royale With Cheese.”  So, next time you get the chance, you a smooth-line from Pulp Fiction or a death-threat-like line from Scarface! Believe me, they work, I just proved it!
