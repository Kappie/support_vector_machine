So after almost two years I will be back on campus as a student again. I will be joining campus by the middle of this month. I have heard a lot about the MBA programme and the associated life and this is really going to be an exciting time. I am looking forward to get some real work done in the next few years. Other then that, not much is happening around here. For all those people from Bhubaneswar, who have been outside for sometime, you guys will be glad to know that thhings are changing really fast. We have our first mall, disco, PlanetM, Cafe Coffee Day outlet and a lot more places to hang out here already. aAnd things are changing really fast. There is talk about Airtel launching it's service here and both Barrista, Inox and Pizza Hut will be opening outlets soon. So finally after all these years of lagging behind in obscurity, the city is finally coming of age. Sometimes I wonder why I bother to post anything on this site. I wonder does anybody ever read this, why the hell am I wasting my time. But just as I am going to give this up, somebody like you comes around and makes all this worth it. So please take a moment and leave me a message to let me know that you were here and your thoughts on me and my site. N.B. I HAVE CHANGED OPERATORS AND MY NEW CELL NUMBER IS 94370 95802. Until later then..... MALOY
