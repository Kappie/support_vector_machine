There is only one other person in this wide, woolly and wholly indispensable world who has any idea what the hell I’m talking about. She knows who she is, you, however, may not (which matters not in the least). There are moments that arrive from that untouchable nominal realm which knock (Yes, this is a reference to opportunity’s ragged cliché.) in such a surreal way that the heart is enticed to whole-heartedly throw open the rusted bolt and open the door so as to  graciously smile at that girl on the other side of the threshold. There she stands, in much the same garb (This reference is not wholly a physical reference, perhaps you both are encumbered in similar emotional apparel.) as yourself, perhaps slightly squirming in her shoes the same way you do in yours, with a smile rivaling the smile she induces on you.  There are walks and talks under moonlight that both parties had long ago relegated to those fantasies that the mind tells the heart will never occur (Is this sentence constructed correctly? Does it impose the intended impact? Does it conjure the desired the sense? Please let me know). Under the dipping stars (Only two people [I am one of them] smile at this image in the most honest way.) hands are held in a way that is truer than hands have even been held while ladies walk sideways (Once again, a reference for only the two.) While the world may not love a lover, the lover loves their love.
