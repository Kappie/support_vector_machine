I'm just laying there, listening to music with my eyes closed...and my mom gets up to go to the bathroom or something. I'm clueless to what she's about to do...and when she comes back, She slapped me in the forehead. Well...since this was unexpected,I like start convulsing...and then laugh my ass off as my mom like goes into a seisure from laughing. It was great. NEWayz...its like... 8:15 in the morning now...its raining like a bish...and my dog is spazing on my arm....go figure!
