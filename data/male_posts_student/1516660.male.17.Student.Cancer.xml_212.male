WQ came to study...and I had fun talking. Yep. The silly ramblings of a deluded lonely cat. After studying, we played the PS2 and I cooked mee for him again. Hmm...this time round, I made a comeback using Phoenix. HeHe! I mainly won by using my throws. Solar Flare ar...and I knew how to take opportunities and also built up my "trance" meter. Yeah. Special moves can be done using the blue bars up there. I don't think WQ knows. His specials were mainly done by luck. My strat was to keep him as far away as possible using throws, build up my meter, and attack using my special moves. Hehe! Opps, WQ might read this. Oh well! WQ!! Pretend you didn't read ar! Heh.  Oh my my!! I download the PoA movie trailer! Oh my god! It's so exciting! Ahh!!! I love the Hogwarts choir. They are singing a song from MacBeth, one of the Weird Sister's spell. I will post the lyrics later, courtesy of  urlLink MuggleNet . Everybody matured a lot! The most obvious is Malfoy! Boy, he sure grew! Hermione grew more beautiful. Lupin and Black (the actors who play them) are so handsome! The actress who plays Trelawney is so beautiful too! Of all the teachers, I love Trelawney the best! :) I am so excited about this movie!! Oh oh oh!!   I just returned from Survivor. Oh my! That was a close shave! Rupert's not eliminated! Good good good! He can continue winning Immunity. But oh well. These are the people I would like to get into the Final Four: Rupert, Christa, Sandra, Lil. I feel that they play the game real well. And they have the potential to outwit, outplay and outlast the rest. Uhm-hmm!   Alright...I think I end liao. Okay....lyrics first.  Double, double toil and trouble;  Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.  Double, double toil and trouble--  Something wicked this way comes  Eye of newt, and toe of frog,  Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,  Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,  Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing,â€”  Double, double toil and trouble;  Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.  Double, double toil and trouble;  Fire burn and cauldron bubble.  Something wicked this way comes.  Heh heh! I love this song. Currently memorising it and singing it! Alright...see ya later. Night blog!
