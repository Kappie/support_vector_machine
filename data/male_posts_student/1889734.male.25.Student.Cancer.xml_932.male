"'We will get voters registered, we will get voters mobilized, we will get voters to the polls!' Edwards said during a campaign stop at Orlando's St. Mark African Methodist Episcopal Church. 'We're going to make sure that all those voters that go to the polls and cast their votes, that [their] votes are counted this time.'"   Never mind that after a half dozen recounts performed by the media, including the NYT, all show Bush winning Florida.  Never mind that not one single individual has been able to prove that any black votes weren't counted.  And never mind that Gore's team sued to have military absentee ballots thrown out.  No, don't let the truth get in the way of the old lie about Florida.  I don't know Edwards very much.  I had the impression that while he held beliefs I couldn't support, he at least might be an honorable man.  That might not be the case based upon what I've been seeing in the past couple of weeks.  Just like Liebermen in 2000, it seems that the Democratic machine requires you to sacrifice intergrity in exchanges for a spot on the ticket.  Too bad....
