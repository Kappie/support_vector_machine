But Hell hath no fury like a Jewish grandpa…  Every year, my Jewish grandparents come from Florida (what a surprise!) to stay in my uncle Bob’s house.  While they’re here, my dad and I visit them as frequently as possible.  It’s a long walk from my house to my uncle’s, but I never mind it.  It gives me time to brace myself, and joke with my dad about past experiences with his parents.  We get to the house and walk down a strip of cement past the various plants my aunt and uncle have put in over the years.  Just before we get to the door, we can see inside the window where my grandparents sit, watching TV, trying to make sense of Joe Rogan as he abuses people on Fear Factor (but that’s a whole another post).  My dad fakes blowing them away with machine guns, as they look on, oblivious to our laughing.  I could swear they know what he’s doing and they make fun of him when we leave.  We step inside, give them ice cream (if we don’t they sacrifice children…I used to have 2 sisters), hug them, and move into the kitchen to put the ice cream away.  My grandpa comes in behind me, talks to me, talks about how big I’ve been getting and how I better gain some more weight, and starts off into any random story you can imagine.  It doesn’t follow that pattern always, I’ve never ever been able to pinpoint where he moves into the death trap.  Like a ninja he moves in and engulfs me in a story that ranges anywhere from God to Fidel Castro.  His stories do to your mind what 8 shots of heroin, 5 doses of Nyquil, and a punch the face from Mr. T could only do on Mardi Gras.  It’s never a story that has an end either.  He can go from the birth of Christ, to World War 2, to Fidel Castro, to Hawaii, back to Christ, to the British, to Germany, back to World War 2, to World War 1, to the Civil War, to the Indians, to textile, to cotton, to Cuba, to Fidel Castro again, to slavery, to South Africa, to Jesus when he was older, to slavery, to World War 2 again, he stays there……..Stays there some more……Just a little bit longer…….  Then, he goes to Iraq, to Japan, to Hawaii, to the Bronx, to the Revolutionary War, to the life of Christ, to World War 2, and his entire family and life in connection with everything said.  Here’s the scary part:  I never see or hear when, where, or how he changes subjects.  Ever.  For the last 2 years I’ve been searching for where he changes his subject and continues on something else.  Recently, I’ve just given up.  I’ve trained myself to nod every 6 seconds while sleeping with my eyes open.  I plan to record him talking and put his voice to a techno mix.  Millions will overdose on ecstasy while listening to tales of my grandpa’s time in the Army Postal Service.  The usual pulsing beat of a car with it’s stereo turned up will be replaced by a booming voice of, “…then in 1946, when I was just winding down from my job in Brooklyn…” And a new techno will rise.  There will be a trend of people adding the weirdest things imaginable to techno.  (In a much more explicit version of this post, I list different possibilities.)  As the undisputed old-school Godfather of this trend, I will cower in my house, slowly going mad at the wave of idiocy that I caused by a simple joke listed in a weblog like this one.
