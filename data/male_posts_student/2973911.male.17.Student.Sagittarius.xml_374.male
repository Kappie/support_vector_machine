I'm using Windows 98.   bro,    I'm still alive. Sali ka nga sa game of 20 questions namin.  Faust,    We've talked about this bro thing. Remember the time... blah blah blah. It's probably part of the archives in this so-called blog.    Kaya nga. At least nagka-clue na kami sa answer mo.  3. Is it more solid than liquid?
