Could have done without the crappy boots that never stayed dry but oh well, lifes a bitch.   So the blog gods were listening kinda. When I got back from the trip, my friend called me so we went to hangout (I was tired as hell but took some motrin and drank some coffee to spend time with her). I think she likes me but is undedcided if she wants to pursue anything with me due to the fact that she is moving to California in a month. She said that we will see what happens if she moves or not. I hope she doesnt but I do not want her to stay with me out of pitty or guilt. I want her to feel happy with her choices so if that means watching her go away to California, then I will have to let her go. It will be very sad but I want her to be happy.   Today, my friend and I are going to hangout in my truck and watch movies on her laptop, and no nothing is going to happen!!!!! Jerks! I will tell her watch I just told you random people of the internet.
