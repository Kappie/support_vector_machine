So I went to New York and I'm staying with my friends here. Two nights ago, I stayed over at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It was a great experience, one that I reccomend to all college bound students.  Anyway, I have a gripe I'd like to address.  PT Cruisers are a widespread infection in the United States. They, along with George W. Bush (as well as G.H.W. Bush), are the reason the world laughs at us, rather than with us.  I went out the other night with some friends and witnessed something truly scarring - a  convertable    purple   PT CRUISER. I though, "Shit, that can't get too much worse..." but then, "Shit, it's worse." There was a 65 year old man wearing a cotton t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, athletic shorts, and big, cop sunglasses. HE WAS EATING AN ICECREAM CONE.  His wife, or "lady" as I expect he calls her, sat there with a plaid sleeveless shirt, up-doo and a big-ass icecream cone.   The purpose of the PT Cruiser was to rekindle the passion teenagers had for funky, non-ricer cars during the surfer era. What it actually did was rekindle that same passion in the people that were actually  alive  during the surfer era. The same goes for the Honda Element, the Volkswagon Beetle, and and of the new cars in the Chevy line, because those look like the demon spawn of a PT Cruiser.   Please, less PT Cruisers, sooner. (Like now, actually...)
