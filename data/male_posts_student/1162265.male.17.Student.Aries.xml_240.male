It was sensationless, and when I look back on it, that doesn't really bother me.  I just didn't exist, but at the same time all the parts of my body existed, all the blood that circulates in it now, existed.  So was I really born?  Or was I formed together?  So, really, this is just a current state we're in, and I find it hard to believe an afterlife exist, and if it did without your body would you really be the same person?  First FNL practice today.  Imagine a room filled with people who love to be the center of attention.  Yeah, pretty nuts.
