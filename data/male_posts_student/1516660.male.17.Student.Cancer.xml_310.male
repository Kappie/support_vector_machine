Well, let's skip the morning, as nothing really interesting happened. Oh yes...the plan failed. Not really. She didn't put the leaves. Darn. Heh. Okay. I played my game until WQ smsed. He basically said that he's alone at Orchard now, and would like me to go down there to see the Chingay Parade with him. After much thinking, I agreed lor. So, I wolfed down my dinner and rushed out to meet him.  Hm. Hann and Ke Yun is coming also, but they are meeting us later. I accompanied WQ to eat, then we went out to find a spot. HaHa. It was getting crowded, but we got a nice view, up a parapet, between Taka and Wisma. Heh Heh. Soon, Hann and KY came. They went to look for seats at the performing area (we are the area where the contingents just walk past without performing. the performance area needs tickets to get in), but there are no seats. After standing around, we decide to scout for a better place to watch the performance (and I think people on the parapet were so happy because we left. Heh).   Okay. Lets try to make things short. We finally found a place at Performance Sector 4. After so many searching, climbing on fences and using lamposts and trees as support (and being chased down by the idioitc police...grr!) and walking to find places, we found some space at the road in front of the stands in Sector 4. YH said "nobody said we cannot sit there, so why not?".   HaHa! We got such a clear view of everything because the performers were very close to us. However, when we arrived, the parade just started (and it ended in Sector 1. Heh Heh). The first contigent was the Opening Parade. OMG! Got lotsa stars there! Cynthia Koh, Jacelyn Tay, The President, Terrence Cao. The biggest attraction is Jackie Chan! WE SAW JACKIE CHAN!!! OMG! All of us waved at him like mad sia! HAHA!   I don't have time to list every parade (and my memory is not that good anyway), so I will just describe my favorites. RSS participated!! When we saw a banner being proudly carried out by our RSS boys, four of us started cheering madly. HaHa! The Chinese and Modern Dance particiapted in this dance segment. YH was trying to attract their attention and make them laugh. Heh Heh! After that, got the Japanese contigent, the Sakura one. They spew out lotsa sakura (fake ones of course). HaHa! The last one which I throughly enjoyed is the American International School's performance. They grooved to Me Against The Music. Coolies! I love that song, and the performance too! Meow!  The last contigent arrived and we followed it till Dhoby Ghuat. We then took the MRT back. I accompanied WQ to eat at BK lor. My feelings? I really enjoyed myself lor. I felt very very happy, something which I didn't feel for so long. :D After reaching home, I ate a chicken bun, bathed and went to sleep.    TODAY   Heya. Okay. Today, in the morning, Mother cooked laksa for lunch! YAY! So yummy! I encouraged her to do it AGAIN! Heh Heh.  In the afternoon, me, Ji, Ji's brother, Joyce, KimSeng and Gloria  went to play badminton. Originally, we planned to play in the badminon court, but all the courts are fully booked. After walking for ages, we finally found somewhere in Marsiling. We played and played until 6. They went to the MacDonalds nearby to drink and talk. We went off at 7. I reached home at 7.30, bathed and ate my dinner.  ayiah. So rushing. HaHa. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
