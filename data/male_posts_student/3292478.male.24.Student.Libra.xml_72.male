Opposite me was a little stone gnome who began singing to me but without making any noise, we ended up having a silent sing off with each of us getting more and more exuberant in our facial movements. After a while I noticed a female director staring at us laughing profusely, at which point the gnome's little stone hat slid off his head. urlLink    Then I woke up. Now what the hell was  that  all about!?!
