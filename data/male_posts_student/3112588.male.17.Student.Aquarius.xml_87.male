LoL! How could I have just discovered that he had a Xanga site? I believe that he told me, but I was probably too busy talking to hear him...oh well, at least I found it. When I started reading it, I was quite convicted. In one of his posts earlier in the year, he was talking about how his internet was down--and right away he had the answer why: the Lord was trying to teach him that he was spending too much time on the computer, and not enough time in the Word. You're probably wondering what it was that exactly convicted me...? Well, it was the fact that he's such a young person, yet he has this special connection with the Lord Jesus Christ that I have always wanted...it's like God is his friend, as well as his Father. I see how he can just look at a situation, and point out why it's happening...and sometimes, he can even tell me what I can do to help the greuling process along, and grow from it. Now, I'm sure some of you are thinking that I must be crazy to think that Tim Cooper knows everything...well, I don't think he knows everything--but I do know that he know's a lot about the Word of God, and that he has been put in my life to help me through situations. The Lord isn't going to give me someone that is going to lead me astray--at least I know that's not the kind of God I committed my life to. But, I just thought for a minute about our church and the problems going on at Fairhaven Bible Chapel with my peirs. The people that I truly do care about have buried themselves deep in this worldly pit, that leads them deeper and deeper into uneeded drama that is creating dissension among our youth. I'm glad that I'm no longer as involved in the drama, as I used to be...now, I am a bystander watching as the people that I have grown up with destroy eachother and discrase the Lord's name. Don't get me wrong--I once was a part of all this ignorance and backbiting...but ever since March, I've sworn off of it. I decided that I would not be a part of what is bringing out youth ministry down--but what can I do to help them? What can I do to help the one's that I love, become the strong faithful Christians that I know they can be? Well, I first off have to be an example...instead of sitting around and watching them hurt eachother (which I will not stand for), I must be a prayer warrior and continue to be in the Scripture's daily. The only way that I can help them, is obviously to let the Lord help me first--and grow me into the spiritual being that part of me wants to be. A couple of weeks ago, an elder at our church talked about wanting a "double-portion" of someone that was spiritual...they mentioned that they wanted a "double-portion" of Jean Gibson...myself? Well, I want a double portion of Tim Cooper's spirituality. I want to be like Tim, in the sense that I want to be able to guide one's that I care about in the right direction, and give them the counseling that I know that Lord wants me to give them--instead of repeating the same habit of using my own PIECE OF MIND. Sure, I'm a smart guy, and I do often deal with situation's in a LOGICAL way...but perhaps the Lord wants me to not lean on my understanding--and instead lean on His undersranding and wisdom. So the words that have come out my mouth recently to the one's that I love at church--I meant every single one of them. I will not apologize for expressing what the Lord has shown me and put on my heart. I'm sure that I could have presented my explanation in a different way...but you all should know that I'm not going to tell you something if I don't mean it--at least the people that I have rebuked lately. I am not a part of the drama at church--instead, I am asking the Lord to make me a part of the solution. Hopefully other's will take example and begin to grow as I yearn to grow. We ARE carnal Christians--and it took me a while to swallow that pill. We aren't filling our minds with things above--but instead, we are obsessed with the worldy and the superficial. I have said before that the FBC High School Ministry is dying--but I will not be a part of the destruction. I will be a part of the solution, and I urge everyone reading this (no matter if you are in high school or not) to be an example of the apitamy of a Christian Youth...together, we can make a difference, and do what the Lord calls us to do--be more like Him. Sound cheesy? Well, better cheesy than untrue...
