Mail global survey of about 37,000 Internet users in 11 countries, 20 percent of U.S. residents admit buying products from spam purveyors. About 78 percent said they delete spam."   -----------------------------------  Ok, this is why some people need to be shot. Normally I am not a big advocate of violence, but come one. This means that every company that can get my email address will send me junk, knowing that there is A ONE IN FIVE CHANCE that I’ll buy from them. ONE IN FIVE! That is absurd. Of course if anyone of my loyal readers happens to fall in the category and is offend by my comments..... too bad, I still think you should be shot. Besides we all know that no one reads this, I don’t even read this. (But then who is "we all?")
