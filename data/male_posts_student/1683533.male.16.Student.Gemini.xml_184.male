Anyways, its just random stuff picked off the street, and alot of the times the stuff is funny.  Here they are: (Note: Captions in quotations are captions from the website, and the ones without them are my comments)    urlLink    Haha, that's classic urlLink      urlLink    "i used to work at a bookstore in bellevue, washington.  last february i discovered this somewhat frightening/intriguing to-do list in an empty shopping basket"  urlLink      urlLink    First time I saw this, I got scared...very very scared... urlLink      urlLink    weird urlLink      urlLink    "found in the hands of my 65 year old special needs aunt  who picks up everything she sees, especially the shiny things. she picked it up during a walk to the park in mesa, arizona."  urlLink      urlLink    "this polaroid is one of our favorites. i unearthed it from down deep  in the couch cushions. since our couches were purchased at a  second-hand store, the photo's origin is shrouded in mystery.   it's hard to tell the year, but the cars in the background and  the little girl's outfit suggest the 60's or 70's. they're most likely  just getting out of a wedding. the old guy's expression is classic--  that or he's sneezing from her perfume. " urlLink      urlLink    "i found this note on the ground in a subway station in brooklyn.  here's what i love about it:  1. it makes one queasy to see someone with fifth-grade writing skills talkin' nasty. now, i pray she isn't actually in fifth grade but the loopdy-doop handwriting doesn't plead the case she's not. spelling-error-prone sex talk reminds you that these people are procreating, not you.   2. we're chugging along in the letter-- friends, friends, want to be friends-- and then she drops the bomb. awesome surprise ending.   3. it's 2003 and the little ladies are aggressive. this note is evidence that today's young females are finally making their presence known in the previously male-dominated field of beggin' for it. damn.   4. like many great works, there is room left for interpretation. the debate rages on in my own office. now we know she wants him inside, yes, but all the only-friends part.... is she really asking for no-strings-attached sex? or was the friends-only assertion one that subsequent paragraphs negate? was all that just a clever literary technique to draw the recipient in, a nod at innocence and protocol, a set up for the revelation of her true intentions? does she, in her heart, want to date this boy or does she truly only want, you know, to feel him inside of her? we will never know. " urlLink     Hope you enjoyed those as much as I did, feel free to comment on them, check out the  urlLink site  too.
