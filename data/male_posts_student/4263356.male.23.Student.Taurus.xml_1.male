I just keep reminding myself that I am indeed still signed up for the Philadelphia half marathon about a month from now.  Yeah, smart move-I know.  Anyway, as promised-some of my feelings right now.  I am finding myself entering into the school mentality, even at this fourth day.  By that I mean school basically envelopes the individual and a new perspective is formed and that is one of constant academia.  It is something I am really going to try and avoid because even though it may foster awesome learning it may annoy those who I still need to keep in contact.  And that would be my friends and family back home.  When I call home and talk with friends and family I really don't want to dwell on everything that is happening in school.  Yes, it is interesting to hear stories about a med school experience but life is actually more than that.  And yes, I believe it will be possible to have a life outside of this med school experience.  As such, I have made some rules for myself.  As much as humanely possible I will not be studying on Friday or Saturday evenings.  Tomorrow I already invited some friends over to my apartment for some grilling and then there is a frat (yes, a med school frat) party over in Manayunk that I believe we will be attending.  That will be my attempt at socializing and getting away from school.  I think that will be a necessary part of decompressing from the intensity of the weekdays.  I've already made it a priority to do some sort of physical exercise-be it running or biking or lifting weights before I even begin studying.  So far I have started studying around 7 each night and can make it to 10:30 or 11 with a few interruptions.  I believe that will be adequate for now and of course things will pick up in two weeks when we have our first exam.  A delicate balance is the name of the game here.  I actually want to have a Philly life.  What motivates me is a chance to avoid what happened to me for the first 2 years at Grove City.  There was a whole lot of learning how to do work and play, and as most of you know I wasn't the most social being for a couple of years there.  But like most things, you learn and move on.  I'm very excited about this new journey, I have already met some different people and enjoy learning their stories.  I suppose that is part of the reason I want to be a doctor.  To be able to hear a person's story and help them in any way possible is a great feeling.  To be in total humility and service to another person is what brings joy to life but unfortunately it seems not enough focus is placed upon that philosophy.  I mean, allow me to bring in to the arguement what I believe the best example of that is; the life of Jesus Christ.  Reading the Gospel accounts of what He did for humanity blows me away.  And He kept things simple, serve others and you will be rewarded, do unto others as you would have them do unto you and you will be rewarded with joy and happiness.  These things seem so self-evident yet most of us continue to look inward and then to material fulfillment to bring about "happiness".  I could probably type for a very long time about humility and what it means to me and how I've seen its power in my life and how I fall short of its fruits all the time but I think I'll save more ramblings for a later date.  My bed is calling out for some lovin and I must oblige in the hastiest way.  Peace.
