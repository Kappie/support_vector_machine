Not many people will know why, and those that do will either not read my blog or not care. Depressed. Definitely depressed.  Took some brieftime photos up on Crickley Hill, they should kick arse. Well, the ones that are any good. Some of them were, on the whole, bollocks, but it wasn't that bad. I'll go somewhere on Saturday, there should be millions of fireworks on Saturday. Whoopee! Well, BANG.  I am, it must be said, getting a little distressed about being known at Showstoppers as "Scott's friend, Jon". By being there for about 10 weeks (if you count before the summer as well), one would assume I would be able to be a person in my own right by now. Obviously, I do not assume that I would be thought of as a member impartial to Scott, that'd just be daft. But as a performer, it must be said that I like being accepted in my own right. And that makes me sound a complete arsehole but you know exactly what I mean. Mel, especially, seems to somewhat ignore my prescence. That insinuates different things, but I'm not sure what any of them are. She probably just finds me annoying. That's most people's reason.  Been thinking about Beccay. She is really quite scary, she's got into my mind.  Hm, very much thinking about Mel now.... *hits self so Scott doesn't have to hit him*. Ah. Just noticed the insinuation. No, I'm not thinking about her in THAT way. I was just thinking... I reckon she'd be fairly photogenic... *contemplates asking her to do some modelling type things in Gloucester, dismisses on grounds that she doesn't like him*. Once I've finished this colour film I need to go Zoe to hold up what she said she'd do for me... heheheh... Sorry, that insinuates.  Very, very, VERY lonely.  Quote of the day: "Pray, silence please! The band begins A melody triumphant! The trumpets playing to their whim, The trombones play enjoyment!  Again begins the somber sound, The end is now in sight, Falling for the final ground, The flute again takes flight."  From Jon Roskilly's   For the love of music   Love, Jon Roskilly
