With the party tomorrow and everything, I don't want us to be on bad terms.  That doesn't mean I'm agreeing with you.  It just means I'll try and keep the 'gossip' as you call it down, and we'll end this whole argument.  Cause if this isn't fun, theres no point. A few other notes: The spell bowl people: I didn't know any of them either.  All I know about them is that they had their names on the list but didn't sign up.  I was complaining about lack of commitment in general.  I didn't post the dream here because it was all about people you guys don't know.  I'm serious there, I didn't think it would interest you.  Believe it or not, most of what I've said is stuff I've thought would interest you, I mean, if you told me about similar problems I would genuinely be interested, whether I knew the people or not.  That's why it made me so mad. Anyway, it's over now.  Back to our regularly scheduled sillyness. SQEE!
