We, however, could switch dress codes on tuesday. That was a good idea tori, with going to the trift store, because it would also be problematic if we didn't get our uniforms back in time for the awards ceremony on wednesday (I don't know about the rest of you, but i only own one kilt that fits me). If anyone likes this idea, please say so in your next blog
