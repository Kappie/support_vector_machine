So, what am I going to do about it?  For starters, I actually ENJOY the odd cigarette. This is a recent thing. Usually Lambert  Butlers. We all know the effects. It's like self harm. Well, I'll self harm no more, and stop before I'm too addicted and it's too difficult to do so.  I sometimes smoke pot/wacky backy/cannabis or whatever you want to call it. Passing a joint around occasionally when out with certain friends has started to become the 'done' thing. It may be a very fun, sociable activity, but what it all boils down to is smoking a joint does the same harm as 4 cigarettes. It is medically and scientifically proven. So that is stopping too!  Going to bed after 2AM and getting up at 1 or 2PM is no good. It's missing half the day. It's sleeping your life away. It's pointless! I'm going to start getting into a good sleeping routine.  Eating muffins, chocky and biscuits, bags of pork scratchings and drinking fizzy drinks is also practically self harm in my new opinion. From now on- breakfast every day. I'm going to set myself meal times, and stop eating bits and pieces all day. A good, balanced and healthy diet from now on.  And finally, exercise. I ride or walk to practically anywhere I need to be. But from now on, designated exercise mornings and evenings each week are going to be just the job for me. A good long ride on a saturday morning? Walking down town on a sunday for a stroll about the shops and a walk down the marina, where I'll pick up a nice healthy sandwich from that shop that has them nice ice creams. And maybe a half hour of sit-ups and other little such excercises every night. Maybe. I'm not sure if I'm that desperate!  I'm fit and healthy now. But if I continue like I am, well, I wouldn't want to get any more unhealthier or err.. unfit. So, as of today- the 30th of July 2004, I'm going to carry out all that stuff. Elliot is gonna actually get off his arse and start exercising. He's already became a veggie (something I swear I would never want to and will not do) so he eats quite healthily. He hasn't smoked a thing for quite some time. But he really could do with some exercise!   Today has been the usual. We had my cousin again, as I said in the last post. The little sod, pushed loads of rocks into the pond, nearly overflowed the bathroom sink, squashed me rhubarb I've been lovingly tending for quite some time, ran out the house n wudn't come back wen I shouted him (by then I wasn't gonna actually stop him playing on the road). Git.   I did manage to get my aunty on the ole scooter round the fields wen she came up to get him. She didn't know how to ride it, she was screaming wen she was goin down the field at 10mph and me and me mam pissed ourselves laffing.   Then I managed to give my mam a croggie n made her scream and nearly cry in fright. God, woman, wots the matter with you! When she was on by herself she did actually manage to TURN this time. I was quite impressed!  Thats all from me for err, yesterday. Good night my little readerinos. Enjoy scotland, Ste. Going the day after tomorrow, eh? Say hello to Hickers for me. That reminds me, Thursday today wasn't it? Anto has gone to Birmingham :-( deserter! It should be 'once a monkeyhanger, ALWAYS a monkeyhanger!' (and for that you should have to stay in good ole Pools)!  Song of the day: 2-4-6-8 Motorway (Tom Robinson)
