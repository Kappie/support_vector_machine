I ended up getting lost in a dead end and found a playground called Wm. Orchard Playground, in Maplewood. I remembered it distinctly from back in fourth grade. Me and Erika Tomzak went there one day to hang out. I also passed by both Jefferson and SOMS, bringing back lots of memories. I can't wait to look back on highschool with enhanced retro-specto-vision. Maybe then I'll be able to see the obviously wisest path of actions, and how I took a path almost perfectly perpendicular to it. My walk also inspired me to consider buying new shoes. These converse are starting to give me severe foot-aches, so I guess the "flat foot of doom" myth was true after all. I can't imagine wearing anything else though; growing up everybody in cartoons wore converse, and to me, everything else just looks too stylized. Except Pumas, they're nice and simple, I know how to work the simple shoe. Anybody want to lend me  urlLink $80 ? I got home after about fifty minutes of walking, which was roughly three miles distance. I was almost late for Kirsten's surprise party, but no. Stephen kindly drove me over and I was in. Besides a lackluster "Surprise." the little get-together was nice. I got to know some of the kids on the fencing team a bit better, and got to grill some meat. It's exactly as simple as I thought it was.   Tomorrow morning me and Zack will be shipping out to Pennsylvania to visit the Pops, and I get to DJ the ride there. I really want to show him Belle  Sebastian, Television, Squarepusher, Sleater-Kinney, The Smiths, The Unicorns, Mission of Burma, Yo La Tengo, The Moving Units, and mostly Breaker! Breaker!. Hopefully he'll enjoy it and I can claim some responsibility for his growth into an educated and stylish man.   Someone needs to smash the high-school prom tradition with a Divine Hammer. Instead of my senior prom, I intend to go on a drive, a really long drive, North, and I'll call the awesomely expansive and beautiful territory I find, "Maine". " urlLink I'm trying to organize a prison break. " My car will be able to seat  four other people . The revolution will not have a door-price.
