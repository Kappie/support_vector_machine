So where to begin - first of it wasn't such a bad birthday after all I saw the Christ movie and I have to say for such an overtold story, such as the crucifixion, it was done wonderfully. The fact they used subtitles, only added to the reality of the whole situation, and every character (apart from unfortunately Jesus I hasten to say) was cast to perfection. Maybe Mel Gibson could have tried it although I doubt the results would have been greatly different. I saw the movie with Jo and her mate Wendy who is the funniest large lady in the world - bar none. The morning was spent with the continuation of the minimal dialogue epic between me and my mother, with Harry there to ease the tension somewhat. The presents were pretty average for my birthday, not that I'm complaining mind you, I'm always pretty contempt with any present anyone ever gives me.  Anyway the day after was most definitely, more than previous days I'd used the example, bitter-sweet. My sister woke up and I was left there watching Harry Potter for a couple of hours. The as a delivery came, I forgot to putt the lock on the latch and it slammed shut behind me and I was left there with only my baggy PJ's on for a couple of hours. The once I managed to gather the strength and knocked on some one's door to use the phone. I was greeted by a lovely large Caribbean lady (whose name sadly evades me) who gave me tea and somewhere to warm my frost bitten feet. Once Mum had come with the keys I hyped myself up for the football. I take back that big speech I made just a couple of weeks ago about how we couldn't beat Arsenal, well, WE DID IT, WE BEAT ARSENAL DAMMIT, and it was well and truly brilliant in every sense of the word. Now we face Monaco in the semis, after unbelievably (well not really considering what there defense is like) they beat Real Madrid, and I really now can see a Chelsea v Milan final, which we would have an outside, but decent chance of winning *dreams*. Well I'll see you lot later then . . . xBuBzx
