The goalies didn't play awful - except on one goal against Khabibulin.   The leaders and stars showed up - Preemow, LeCavelier - and the kids gave up nothing, either.  The referees swallowed their whistles about 1/2 way through the 3rd period, but no players complained.   The overtime was SO intense.  Up and down - and no TV timeouts!  God I LOVE that!  Constant hockey.    All that orange does something weird to the cameras....or maybe it's my old, tired eyes.  This serves to reinforce what Playoff Hockey is all about.
