Maybe once in a while we should think about all the reasons we are friends with one another, all the good points, rather than nit-picking.    Sometimes things are said as jokes, but most jokes have an element of truth  and they actually affect us in a negative way.  You probably think I'm crazy for saying stuff like this but I sort of don't care anymore.  I no longer want to be non-confrontational if it means ignoring my values. I'm in one of my moods again.  Maybe I'm just overly dramatic, but I'm still pissed about  urlLink that comment .
