Tomorrow i think i might go to the seventh street entry and see a show. I have not been to one in such a long time. maybe j with go along, and i might call anne and see if she will be there too.  I think tomorrow night i will be getting blotto, completely blotto. Go to a show, go to the TR or the CC, hopefully the CC and i will have so much fun.  That'd be nice.  one more week of summer school. That will be very nice to have over, however i have a re-write and another essay to do.  Am excited to see some  urlLink people  actually are reading my blog. Go check his out. He has just the right combination of irony, bitterness, and apathy.
