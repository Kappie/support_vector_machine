Of course, I am using my own interpretation of what Jesus intended, there is the rub: How do we differentiate between what is scriptural and what is personal opinion (to my shame I believe the legalism we impose on people is out personal convenience, not opinion).  Being in a church which widely known for it legalistic tendacies, yet I stay in this same church because we were founded on the humility of knowing we are finite creatures who need much grace to live for and live with Jesus Christ.  Perhaps that is my naive notion of what church should be, humble.  Oh if we could at least have the attitude of Paul, who exhorted the Philippian Church to imitate Jesus in their attitudes, but after that Paul did an "inventory" of his life pre- and post- conversion, and to Paul there was no comparison of the two.  His former of being a Pharisee, A Jew, A Roman citizen with all perks and privileges these titles endowed were to him literally SHIT, that is the word means in Greek, to know Christ is Life, true life. I am a practical kind-of-guy, I want to do anything that emulates Christ and extols him as Lord of my life, knowing the persuasive appeal of Christ's love, I know I am not alone in wanting this.  May God humble us in seeking him and may we glorify Christ in our lives and our assemblies.  Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.      PHP 3:2 Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh. 3 For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh-- 4 though I myself have reasons for such confidence.     If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: 5 circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; 6 as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless.      PHP 3:7 But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. 8 What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ 9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith. 10 I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 11 and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.      PHP 3:12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 13 Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.      PHP 3:15 All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. 16 Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
