The employee, named Pete Goglia, left Seagate at the end of July after 17 years, and will start is new job on August 16th. The company claims that Goglia knows too much about its technology to go to work for a competitor.  urlLink Seagate is asking the courts to prevent him for working at Western Digital's read and write technology division for two years . Seagate says it is not asking the courts to completely stop Goglia from working at Western Digital. So, is Seagate justified in suspecting that a former employee may reveal the company's trade secrets? It's a complicated question. I'm not sure if there are any laws on the books dealing with this. Actually, as I come to think of it, I am not surprised I have not heard a story like this before. What if KFC started seeking court injunctions to prevent former employees from working at McDonald's or Burger King? Now, that would be internating since the Colonel's secret recepie is something we all value. If I were the judge, which I can assure you I am not the least bit qualified to be, I would look closely at Mr. Goglia's contract and see if he made such an agreement or not. And there's something else that struck me: this guy quit his work on July 30 and got a job offer so soon?  Damn!  Why can't the economy be this kind to the rest of us?    This particular employee, who has been here for a very long time, has extensive knowledge of proprietary and confidential information. We believe he will inevitably disclose some of that proprietary information that he has gained through working at Seagate.   (SEAGATE SPOKESMAN,   urlLink  MacCENTRAL   )
