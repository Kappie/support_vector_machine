Cullen Titmas who was playing Ren (Hehas toured nationally) and Jimmy VanTreuren who was playing Rev. Moore(Appeared on Broadway's Scarlet Pimpernel and sitcom Law  Order)   I'm in  Footloose  denial... I can't sleep. I stayed up till 5 a.m. cleaning my room, watching  footloose  and talking to Peter.      IN THE FOOTLOOSE CAST CHAT???    Sean:  even i'd bang that shit   Angela:  cullen?   Me:  sean would bang?   Sean:  yeah, his voice is freakin' outta this world. i'd do whatever it took to hear that beast scream out my name.  hahahahahahaha       August 1st – 7th  I will be in Manhattan for TVI Actors Studio film intensive workshop. If you want to get together for dinner or something defiantly let me know. I called Joanne today to start voice again. Hm... what else did I do... yah thats it. I'm going out to eat with Steph Hemroth tommorow! I haven't seen her in foreverrrrrr...
