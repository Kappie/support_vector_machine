It took every ounce of strength to get me through today, and I came home and checked Damn Hell Ass Kings, which led me to find out that there's a new Six Feet Under teaser trailer on HBO.com (Seriously, go check it out. It's the most awesome and bizarre thing of all time. If you haven't seen Peter Krause lip-sync "Feeling Good" by Nina Simone, you haven't seen Shakespeare the way it's meant to be seen.)  Speaking of that, I want to bring everyone (Paul, Rachel, Sophia) up to speed on Sports Night. With that in mind... Previously on Sports Night: Casey loved Dana. Dan liked Rebecca but got smacked down when she went back to her idiot husband. Dana had a brother that played in the NFL. Natalie and Jeremy hooked-up and had several annoying fights. Issac had a stroke. There was an audio recap/montage, and season one was over.  It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
