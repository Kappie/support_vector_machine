On the way out to get chicken (fried), Katherine's tire popped, so we all pulled over and sharpened our life skills throwing ourselves bodily at the lug nut wrench (Earnest has power, by the way, with the lug nut wrench). We then decided to swing by the smart mart near alanna's house for roman noodles, pringles, hot fries, and one (1) honey bun. That was enjoyable, save the fact that we are currently in allergy season, and last night I could not go for one minute without sneezing out half of my brain.  I went home at 8:00 and popped one, count it, only one Benadryl shit tablet to stop my allergies. It just so happens that Benadryl (fuck spelling) hates my existence. I passed out at 10:00 pm (Saturday night) and awoke at 2:00 am (Sunday morning); upon realizing this, I returned to bed at 2:45 am, and proceeded to have some seriously fucked-up dreams. In the first, I was among a group at my school that decided to kill everyone. It was horrible. I remember shooting people and they would twist and fall down. Then we (the group) hid in a classroom waiting for the police and I was afraid of being shot to death. The second dream was connected to this one. Everything in the first dream had been a dream (in the dream), but half of the school had the dream, and another half didn't. The half that had the dream (dreamt) was afraid of me. I was so upset that I kept trying to call my mom to pick me up, but the phone was not working.  In a third dream, I was in the same school, and the whole school was brainwashed. Next to the second floor windows (this was not WSHS), we (the school) were constructing the nests for species that were going to horribly wipe out the entire earth. The nests involved the egglings, nest material, parmesan cheese and a raw egg mixture. (wtf.) Then the whole school ran away and I was wearing an armed hovering pack. Some eggs began to hatch; I blasted them with some type of fire (I distinctly remember doing this). Three escaped outside. When I followed them, I saw they were attacking Meg Kerr (also in an armed hover pack) with lasers. I tried to help her fight them, but I couldn't.  If any of these seem funny, they weren't. They were terrifying. I should laugh at them.  On a lighter note...  I have been thinking about what all my fellows would be like when drunk. Elise would be in a kind of acting mood, trying to say that she only took "a sip" of a drink, and she would also be laughing and falling all over the place. Alanna would be giggling and laughing and singing kristin hersh and le tigre. Katherine would be acting like a queen; she would laugh and be motherly somewhat to everyone else. Brock would be sprawled half the time, and the other half he would be dancing around with alanna and singing in shrill tones. Alice would dance around constantly laughing, and somewhat stumble every once in a while. Lauren D. and LA would probably watch half the time. The other half, Lauren D. would tackle people, and LA would be walking among everyone. It would be fun and rebellious.  Cheers.
