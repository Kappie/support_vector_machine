But will they discover  The key hid beneath the mat?    This key unlocks it all;  The secrets to the past.  But what it all means to them  Is what they'll find out last.    They're searching for an answer  To a question they didn't ask.  Will they like what they find  When they pull off the mask?   This is another one... I might work on it a little more because I think the beginning could use some help... I'll have to see.
