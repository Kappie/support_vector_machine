I went to a meeting at the Town House for a couple hours and the people I was meeting were not only out of the loop about what they were doing but huffy because they felt they were doing more than they were supposed to be doing.  I explained that when you volunteer to do something, you do it.  However, I think they'll no longer be volunteering.  My female boss got extremely upset over the website I created for her due to the many grammatical errors in the site.  Since it was a collaborative effort and 90% of the content was coming from the old site (which was online for 5 years) and since we have at least a week before we deploy the new site to the web, I didn't feel it necessary to check everyone's spelling.  What turned from her reviewing the site and giving me feedback turned into her writing me an email titled "major problems" and telling me I would have all of her edits in my mailbox tomorrow.   I got stressed, so I went and scraped up $1.25 to get a diet coke, I even had to borrow a quarter.  So I went to the vending machine and they were sold out of diet coke.  So I went to another one: sold out.  So I pushed the "Diet Coke w/Lemon" and a mellow yellow came out.  Ugh!  Disgusted (and in desperate need of a pick me up) I went and got a refund for the soda from the ID office and came back and got a diet coke out of a machine I could actually see the soda.  I came home and worked hard to get my wireless router working again.  Apparently a night of downloading a couple episodes of Stargate has made my router break.  After 3.5 hours, I found out that my router no longer will encrypt my wireless packets and still give me an IP addy that works.  So I turned off encryption, turned on restriction and poof, it's working again.  I just have to be careful what I write on the network now since someone outside could be reading ;).  Cindy Vaca came over at 10 to give me food and go to the airport with me.  Cindy Allen's plane was coming in at 10:30, but she called and said they were delayed.  I checked the website and it said 10:45, which is fine.  I checked it 5 minutes later and it said 10:50.  Hmm.  I checked it again at 10:30 and it said 11:30.  For god's sake!  But we picked her up finally.  She's lost a bunch of weight, looks really nice and even streaked her hair!  We came back, I went to bed at 1, but Cindy and Cindy stayed up until 5 and visited.  I'll write more about the weekend later.
