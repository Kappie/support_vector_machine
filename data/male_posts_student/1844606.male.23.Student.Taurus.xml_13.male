All I have left to do before Wed. is write the best thing I've ever come up with.  Because nothing I do will ever satisfy those annoying pricks in my writing class.  I'm contemplating taking up the fake format of an editorial page and write it "Dude who sits in my rhet class, why you suck" and make it a weekly revolving feature.  Totally passive aggressive, but isn't that what the Internet was built for? (that and porn?).  So my subversive thought for the day is this, if no one is going to like my writing in class, I'm gonna freak them the fuck out.  My idea:  The fab 4....Mousallini, Stalin, Hirohito (I know I'm horribly spelling these names wrong) and Hitler as John Lennon.  First sentence...  Dateline Krakow, Sept. 1, 1939  Fab Four release hit single "Blitzkrieg," takes Poland by storm.   Eva Braun as Yoko Ono.  If you thought people hated Yoko before, just wait.  Don't know what the point of the story is so far.  It would be offensive, but the best thing would be if it had a subtle message so people who attack the idea on princple alone look like idiots because they missed the subtlety.  So tired, wish I could curl up with a Beagle and watch the Bears.  Instead, I shall vent frustration into writing.  Or I wish I could get some hands on studying for Human Sexuality.  Oh well.
