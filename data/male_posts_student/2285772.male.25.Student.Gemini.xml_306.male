"are you gonna live your life wonderin’ standing in the back lookin’ around? are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you’ve grown up or how you missed out?  things are never gonna be the way you want. where's it gonna get you acting serious? things are never gonna be quite what you want. or even at 25, you gotta start sometime.  i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight. are you gonna live your life standing in the back looking around?  are you gonna waste your time? gotta make a move or you'll miss out. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. stick around nostalgia won't let you down. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. whatcha gonna have to say for yourself? i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight.  crimson and clover, over and over. crimson and clover, over and over. our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet? started my rock 'n roll fantasy. don't don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part? kick start my rock 'n rollen heart. i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. so come on davey, sing me somethin’ that i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight. here tonight. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine i wanna fall in love tonight."  -- urlLink jimmy eat world ,  praise chorus
