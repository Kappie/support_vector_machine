Then function that i so far got explored are the camera, camcorder, Mflash n... Hopefully i will not bored of this phone... :)   urlLink    Innostream 99 in cool Blue  urlLink     When think of my sister,i will think of innocent little angel who always got bullied because they are often too soft... Just two days ago, she is hurt verbally by her best fren whom she known since school days... I dunno what had happened in between, but i definitely can feel that she is really sad about it ... as her sis i cant do anything but to comfort her and encourage her to lift up her life coz life still goes on... This is not the 1st time she did it to my sis... frens should be care for each other, not to hurt among ourselves...i mean, what a fren for??? i really dun wan to interferein their conflict but i simply cant fold my arm n let other to treat my sis that way... i m not over protective her but if i can i will ask her to buzz off of my sis life nad get a life for her ownself... Really cant stand of those people who always think of their own profits n willing to sacrify us/our friendship to win the game...This kind of people will not really have friends or there's meaningless in their life.... believe me, they will not enjoy watever they are having/doing... it simply not enough for them... hope that my sis,May, will get over of this soon and may god bless ya~~ Wish that  frens or colleagues will not live they life this way~~
