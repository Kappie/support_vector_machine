You know the cleansing of soiled garments by mean of water and detergent or dry chemicals.  So today for no apparent reason I am pissed off at Jeff, just one of those days. So to give myself a project, I decide to go unclog the fabric softener dispenser of our washing machine. So I unclog it, water runs out of it fine, so I decide to run a load of clothing through. So I threw in a carefully designated pile of only my clothing. I cranked the size to “Super”, water temp Warm/Cold (Warm water wash, cold water rinse). I turned the dial to 15-Super Duty Wash (or something like that, for really clean clothes) and pulled, as pulling the dial starts the machine. The water starts to pour in. Then I add a little more than the “recommended amount” of detergent (this time it is Sunlight Morning Fresh) and put in the clothes. In the freshly cleaned softener dispenser I add uber large amounts of softener. And not the regular, big bottle unconcentrated stuff. No. I fill the dispenser to the top with Downy April Fresh ultra concentrated softener (you are supposed to use ½ a capful). And I start. Then I started the dryer to dry the things just previously in the wash.  About an hour later a buzzer goes off. The dryer is done. While there I was going to put my clothes into the dryer (as the clothing in there was dry) and put in another load. Much to my surprise, I open the washer and it is FULL OF WATER. That’s right. Why was it? Well, when you close the lid of a top loading washing machine, a little probe pushes down a button signalling to the machine that the lid is closed so it can spin uber fast and not spray water or hurt anyone. Well, the button had become dislodged. So I attempted to screw it in. But where the screws would mount the button module, the casing was broken. So I pulled out the handyman’s secret weapon, DUCT TAPE. I taped that button down so good it didn’t know what pressed it! So then I drain the water out and run the load again (because old water is just ICKY). And it all works. So I tell my mom that there was this problem. “Tell Jeff” she says. So I say back, “I am a perfectly competent person and can fix things on my own, and do not need Jeff”. So I did fix it....  So Jeff decides to (later that night) look at the thing. So I went upstairs after showing him where the thing was. What did he do? He took off my carefully wrapped and placed tape, turned off the water supplies for hot and cold to the washer, and tells my sister to not do laundry. Well, fat chance I would listen to that. Why would he make something that I fixed (even if temporarily) broken again? So I told my mom and she told me “Just put the tape back on and do laundry”. So I did. That’s when I discovered the water was turned off. Did he think he could outsmart me by closing a couple of valves? Honestly, give me some credit. I may be a tad dense at times, but for heavens sake, my IQ is 175!!! (okay, it has been down to 168, depending on the test. The IQ averages are: 80-120 is average, 121-150 is above average, 151+ is Genius level). He thought he could outsmart me with water taps. If he wanted to stop the laundry, why didn’t he turn off both sets of taps (the ones supplying the sink, which then lead to a tap for the washer in a series type connection) and take away the water supply hoses? So, essentially, I won the game of wit this time, and I am not altogether surprised. As we speak now, two blankets are in the washing machine, and I believe they are in spin cycle.  With Love,  Bobert  P.S. Yes, I realize the stupidity of a post about washing machines, but it had to be said. I am pretty sure Jeff is part of the Anti-Laundry Coalition of Canada (ALCC). There motto? Smellier, Dirtier, Waterless... At least you learned a few things:  To recap: My IQ: 168-175 Level Classification: Genius (you would never guess when meeting me, I try to not let it go to my head). Average IQ: 80-120 Above Avereage: 121-150 Genius 151+ Jeff is the Anti-Laundry
