An inferiority complex in the mind, dictating that everything about our beautiful country is more beautiful somewhere else. 'You have mistakenly stepped onto the plane heading for Tampere, there is nothing for you in Finland, it's full of cold people and angry bears.' The flight announcer is doing his utmost to go in for the big sell.  Let the truth be known. Finland is a jewel, for whoever finds it, will be astounded by its beauty. There is no clever marketing gimmicks that can ever attract the commercial crowd of Lunn-Polly to sacrifice their stint in the Spanish sun for the simplicity of Finland. For the large majority, Sun, Sea, Sangria... is all they want. Fair enough. A holiday of excess tires the body, working in opposition to the promise of a holiday. The girls; Victoria and Claire, came back smiling, having been nourished by the 'soul-food' that Riina said was to be found in the Finnish forest. It was a delight to hear them say that they would return, despite the lack of night life, despite the several mosquito bites, and despite being nearly killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in the Sauna.  If you ever do go to Finland, be very wary of the offer of an authentic Sauna. You'll be stripped naked, beaten with tree branches, made to swim in the freezing lake, and on a good day inhale a little too much carbon monoxide, making your knees knock to the tune of Finlandia by Sibelius.
