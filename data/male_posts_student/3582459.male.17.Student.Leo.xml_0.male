As I was taking a shower today, I somehow stumbled onto the topic of the ends justifying the means. Generally, people today (at least the liberals who surround and think similarly to me) seem to think that the ends don't justify the means. Usually they give some example along the lines of killing babies for food or imprisoning millions of people to stop one murderer. However, I don't agree wholeheartedly with a blanket statement such as, "the ends do not justify the means," though I don't necessarilly agree with the inverse either.  In reality, the ends do justify means a lot of the time, if the ends are good enough. For example, killing someone is generally considered a bad thing--if we want to apply Kant's categorical imperative (which is bunk, by the way), we could say that killing someone is always wrong--but in some situations it is definitely necessary and perhaps even right; if a man is pointing a machine gun at a hospital full of babies and little girls, it is not only acceptable but even right for the police officers to shoot him. Of course, the assumption underlying this example is that it doesn't matter what party takes an action; the state (police officers) is held to the same moral standards as the individual. I'm going to say that this is a reasonable assumption, as I don't see why the state should be allowed any more moral leeway than the individual.  Some may say that this is a straw man argument, that this is an extreme example that stretches the argument out of proportion. But in reality, this is exactly the kind of argument that exposes the fundamental flaw in saying that the ends don't ever justify the means; when the benefit end is incredibly greater than the drawback means, the end does justify the means. To generalize, when the positiveness of the ends outweighs the negativeness of the means, the ends do justify the means.  Of course, the situations I mentioned earlier (killing babies for food ) still hold. So how do I reconcile the two?  The answer lies in the weighing process. In the situations I mentioned earlier, the ends were marginal in comparison to the means, so the ends do not justify the means in those situations. To generalize, when the positiveness of the ends is outweighed by the negativeness of the means, the ends do not justify the means.  Combine the conditionals I mentioned earlier: the ends justify the means in situations when the positiveness of the ends outweighs the negativeness of the means.  This thought experiment was pretty intuitive and didn't require much complex reasoning, but sometimes when we (we being people collectively, not the royal we) discuss things, we ignore the weighing mechanism and pick the platitude that fits our argument more.  The difficult part with applying this generalization is in situations when the ends and means are closer. Here are some situations:  1. On a heavy note, if we say that abortion is wrong because feti (fetuses?) are humans and have souls (which is sort of implied by parts of the Bible, though I don't think it's ever explicitly stated that killing fetuses is wrong, I may be wrong--I can think of a lot of Biblical and pseudo-Biblical arguments that may or may not hold water for both sides about early abortions that I don't really have the capacity to go into at this point), an argument can still be made for abortion being legal, along the lines of: the benefit of allowing people who would substantially tax society by having babies (through welfare and the like) outweighs the drawback (need a more evil sounding word here) of aborting those fetuses. Basically, this devolves into two main arguments, one about who decides whether the benefit is great enough, and the other about whether abortion is so morally wrong that it's off the charts in evilness (that babies haven't sinned so they are more worthy than sinful humans may figure into this, too). Maybe it's just liberal Palo Alto talking, but I'm inclined toward saying that early term abortions should be universally legal though not encouraged.  2. On a lighter note, if we say that doing things just for college is bad because it leads to cutthroatness and delegitimizing heartfelt compassion when it has to do with community service, a debate arsises with respect to volunteering: is it right for the individual to volunteer to get hours to get into Oxford, Harvard, MIT,  from the view of society? The positive externality by the volunteer to society is helping the world--teaching famished illiterate orphans in Liberia to read--and the negative the intangible cheapening of volunteerism and increase in cutthroatness and competition in society. I personally lean toward saying that the more volunteering people do, the better.  I apologize for using so many parenthetical things; I just talk with a lot of appositives and things like that.
