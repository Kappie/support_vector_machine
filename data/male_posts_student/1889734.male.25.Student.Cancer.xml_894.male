However, this poll has some interesting data buried within.  Check out the table - and I apologize for the formatting. Blogger has been acting up and I can't get this to come across properly.        Issue   Bush now   Bush month ago   Kerry now   Kerry month ago       Terrorism   55   48   37   47       Taxes   49   41   43   53       Health Care   44   38   47   56       Iraq   52   40   49   47       Education   44   43   45   52       Economy   47   45   46   50       In almost every case, Kerry is getting worse as people learn about who he is.  If this trend continues after the convention, he's going to be in big trouble.  Check out some more data.
