We've found ourselves a little lost on what to talk about when our lives are as boring as they are and we do find ourselves a little slow with our quips a time or two and so, we've started a 20-questions game. Faust is the one who's making us guess. It's supposed to be a vegetable. Plantae.  We've got a new member of this blog, Pablo, who I sometimes refer to as P-chan. He's from Washington.  We're trying to ascertain what is happening to Debb.  Faust now has his own personal blog, too. Meadow of Lore, right?  Nothing with me.
