We all have that friend, the one that keeps saying that gay sex is wrong, or gross, or something, that they really have no fucking right to talk about because it never happens anywhere near them. I think that homophobia is such a waste of energy, there are much more useful things to hate, like christianity, or the government!  I'm not gay meself, but i know people who are, and they aren't gross or disgusting. These homophobes seem to think that wherever gay people are going, theyre doing disgusting things out in public and they don't. I don't even know why they're so uptight on this subject, it doesnt say anywhere in the bible or anything that god hates gays, people say some verse in the bible that can be INTERPRETED to say that god hates gays, but it could also be INTERPRETED to say that god doesnt like incest, which is totally fine, incest is pretty stupid. If you're so lame that the only way you can have kids is to do it with your sister, well, that's your business, but it's still pretty stupid.  That brings me back to the homophobia topic, these people who are trying to ban gay sex are prying into other people's business that they have no right getting into. People have the right to live their own life, and just because pat robertson(i hate him) says that we should pray for 21 days to get god to fuck over the supreme court(i hate the supreme court too, but not as much as pat robertson), doesnt mean it's right.  What got me started on this is I just watched that South Park where Starvin Marvin brought the ethiopeans to Marklar, and Pat Robertson(i still hate him) was on the 600 club talking about "now, now, stay with me on this one folks... we need a negative argon tractor disruptor... now not a REGULAR argon tractor disruptor, but a NEGATIVE argon tractor disruptor... to... spread the word of jesus."  That wasn't it, though, after watching 2 episodes of Insomnia, the daily show came on, and they had a report on pat robertson was blabbing his fat mouth off about how god should get those 3 supreme court justices... "God knows their names, he knows where they live..." But if god has such a big opinion about sodomy, why the hell did he let the law get passed in the first place? He's all-powerful, but he cant take shit from the supreme court? I vote to elect a new god! A less lazy one! I'm still athiest, but i'm talking like there IS a god so christians can follow me. Even though there isn't. Are you getting this?  Well, after writing that paragraph, I thought a couple minutes about what to write next, but then I realized that I was done with this topic. So I'll start another one.  I never realized this before, but have you noticed that in the TV show Rugrats, the babies have really REALLY bad and uncaring parents? I mean, they leave their kids in a playpen with holes they can fit through with a SCREWDRIVER, and leave these babies unattended for hours on end! I don't watch it anymore, ever since Dil came on the show the stories have been about how pathetic Chuckie's dad is, how much different Kimi is than the other babies, and all that junk. But i remember that episode, while it was hillarious how they messed the whole house up, when the babies thought the world ended, all the parents had gone out, had left angelica in charge of the babies(i guess), and they ended up filling the house with water.  Tommy is like, what, 1? Yeah, he's been 1 for about 10 years, right? so, assuming that every episode is a day(even though some span 2 or 3... sometimes a couple weeks), once they get to 365 episodes, tommy will absolutley HAVE to have a birthday, right? Or, the world would fold in on itself and everybody would die.  I can't think anymore, my brain is tired, I'm gonna go watch Tron, because its colorful! You don't need to have a non-tired brain to look at the colors, man!
