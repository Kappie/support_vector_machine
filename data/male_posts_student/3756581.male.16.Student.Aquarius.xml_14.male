Yes, the holiday I speak of is the 4th of July. Fireworks, BBQ's the whole 9 yards, it is going to be a blast. There are some people, however, that don't know what The 4th is REALLY about; so I, Whitey McCracka, will give you, my faithful readers, the skinny on the meaning.   The 4th of July, for those of you who don't know, is America's Independence Day. It is a day that should be cherished by all Freedom Loving Americans, because it is the reason that we are the country that we are today. If it weren't for our brave and couragous Founding Fathers, who stood up to the then most powerful country in the world, we would be nothing more then a British colony, and honestly...who would want that? The 4th is a time to reflect on the men and women in uniform that give there lives for us to say what we want, do what we want, and be who we want, without having any kind of state oppression to stop us.   But, since there are people who love, and cherish our God given freedom, there are naturally those who dispise and hate it. You know who I'm talking about, thats right...The Left. The question is why do they hate the country that allows it to hate to begin with? Because they hate the thought of people bettering themselves, they believe that the state should do EVERYTHING for you, including wipe your ass. They want to turn America into a fat, lazy, irresponsible Socialist "Utopia" where everyone shares the work, and the profits. Let me explain how Socialism works really quick here. Let's say you work your butt off, I mean you work to near exhaustion, you WILL get what you deserve, theres no doubt about that. Now lets say your friend, Bob we'll say his name is, doesn't do ANYTHING, not a thing, just stands there and does nothing. He too, will get what YOU deserve. Socialism promotes laziness because everything is handed to you, and you are encouraged not to work.  Anyways! Back on topic! The Left absolutly HATES the 4th of July for mainly one reason; it promotes pride, and we all know that Leftists hate pride..especially when its pride in being American. You can be proud of being Black, you can be proud of being Latin/Mexican, you can be proud of being Arabic, but if your proud of being American you are nothing more then a Fascist Nazi and are not worthy of living.   I have a message for The Left, and Leftists out there: I'm proud of being American, I am DAMN proud of it, and I wouldn't trade the life I live or the country I live in for anything in the world. This is America, Land of the Free, Home of the Brave, and you hate it. You are nothing but a Self-Hating Anti-American Leftist, and you're to thick headed and ignorant to change that. You, and others like you, have nothing to offer America except hate, and discontent for what the majority holds dearly; mostly Freedom. You hate a country that gives you the right to hate it in the first place, and you REVEL in that hatred. Get a clue, get a job, make money, and be happy.   Happy 4th of July everyone, I hope you have a safe, and wonderful holiday.
