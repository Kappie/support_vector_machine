Let's see if the coordination will work out considering the 2 time changes and the parties involved.  Hmm... I should probably dress warmer now that sun is setting.  I have a new obsession with sound quality of mp3s. Bad quality annoys me greatly now.  I average 6-8 hits a day. Who are you people!? Leave comments to the right.  ***
