And I got a lot of practice doing my Chris/Indianna Jones/Harrison Ford half-smiley thing. I think i look pretty good doing it. Hahaha.  Loula and the other peoples kept trying to get me and Lindsay to dance together, and when we finally were, Mr. Phelan came over and told us that we needed to separate a little and not be so close to each other.  They had free slush, I only had 5 of them.  At the end, as the last songs were playing, some of the girls started crying. But by the time we were heading out, I think pretty much every single girl was in tears. Brianna was practically hysterical. When I first saw and heard her crying, I thought she was just pretending becuase she was just bawling. Then she came over and gave me a hug and said that she would really miss me, and I realized that she as acutally seriously crying.  I really just dont understand girls. When we were standing outside, me and ian and billy were standing together, surrounded by all these crying girls, and we were just talking about how we would be seeing each other in two whole days. I can sort of understand it if people start crying on Wednesday, when some people are actually going away, adn we might never really see them again, but not on a Friday when we still have 3 days of school left.  But, girls are just like that. Sometimes I just do something that I find totally fine, and then I realize that girls want to be doing something else instead. Like, I think it was the last song, and they announced that if you still wanted a slush you should go and get one, so I asked Lindsay if she wanted a slush, and she was said sure. So when went and got slush (I got two) and were eating them and I then Lindsay said something like, "Peter, can we please just finish this last dance. I'm a girl and care about this mushy stuff."  and i didnt even realize that a girl would want to do that, probably partly bucause I really like slush and and wouldnt miss a chance to get some more for free.  Now this might make no sense to anyone, bucause I just went back and read it and it barely makes sense to me, but I think you might sort of get what I am talking about.  This is Chicken Man, signing off.  ps. All the girls looked really pretty in dresses, except for the weird uglyish ones, but I wont get into that.  pps. Michelle invented the best dance move ever, the "Daddy, where are you" move.  ppps. Oh and Chris came up with one of the worst dance things ever, you all stand in a line and turn your arms around each other.  pppps. Congo lines are fun, especially during songs that shouldnt have them in the first place  ppppps. Lindsay looked really pretty in her skirt and shirt.
