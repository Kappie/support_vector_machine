The power was out at my house last night, and while after a few hours of sitting around and reading magazines with a flash light, everything turned on and I was like "whoa..."  What else, what else....  oh yea, in case anyone cares, here's a bunch of websites I visit all the time...  http://www.dealrush.com (bunch of video game related deals, updated regularly) http://www.cheapassgamer.com (pretty much the same as the above site) http://www.xboxaddict.com (nice forums, good community, xbox stuff) http://www.xboxelites.com (the website of this xbox clan I'm in, my screen name on there is AlphaCigara) http://www.gametrailers.com (lots of video game trailers) http://www.kragamuffin.com (has bunches of high-quality anime to download, probably my favorite site of this list)
