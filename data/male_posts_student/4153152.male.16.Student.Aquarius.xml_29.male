Monday I felt like crap so I just took it easy all day. It's still Tuesday according to my sleep schedule so we're all caught up.  I've been playing a lot of Rainbow 6 3 tonight. It's is a superb game. The most fun aspect of the game would have to be the overall tactical feel. The entire game experience just sucks you into the world of counter-terrorism. Plus, it's just plain bad ass to go tactical. There's no better feeling than breaching into a room of tangos and blowing the crap out of them.  Right now, I'm playing R63 and working on an old AMD K6 300 MHz system. I'm hoping to get it running as a Battlefield 1942 server running Desert Combat. I'm having some serious problems, but I think I can get it worked out. I'll post up my IP if I can get it running.  I'm out for now, I'm going to do some work tomorrow so I'll be posting, probably.
