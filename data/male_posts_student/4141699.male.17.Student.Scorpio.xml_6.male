They said everything should be squared away now and to call back next week. I hate bureaucracies.  I'm so mad. To hell with preparing for the worst with my roomate, I think I had better start getting prepared  for dealing with -this- kind of  rubbish  for the next four years. Come on! What am I paying $40,000/ year for? Anyway.  urlLink Maria  made this awesome button for me! Check it out =) and link to me!    And if you're a member of the board and would like to link to the board on your site, Maria has made  three  choices:      .  Enjoy, and once again thanks to  urlLink Maria  for all these buttons...She's a teenage genius.
