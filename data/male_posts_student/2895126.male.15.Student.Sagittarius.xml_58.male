He does math in his head; And it has been said That it's funny: his "ng"-dropping drawl.*   *He drops the "-ng" in "running," etc. and uses "runnin'." And yet he still refuses to use contractions like normal people. Well, we've caught him off guard before.   By the way, I've decided my limericks rule so horribly much, I've composed a verse to describe me: "I'm hilarious; my skills are nefarious / Behold, I'm vicarious! My talents are various!" I crack myself up, indeed.    ^Blue-tipped strike-anywhere matches laying on my dresser. Complain all you want Bob, but those are the coolest thing in the world.
