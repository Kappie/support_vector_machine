Keep in mind that I do have a life. I just chose to spend it here for now.  All you dorks be well advised that this is not a book. It's a video game.  Thanks for waiting guys. Here it is:  -----------------------------    Golden Sun: Book One    You wake up as Isaac (or whoever you named your character). There is a storm in your hometown, Vale. Your mother, Dora, wakes you up, and tells you the great boulder from Mt. Aelph is about to fall. She lets you on your own telling you to seek the pavilion.  Four town adepts (or weilders of psynergy) are holding up the boulder with psychic powers.  Once you get to the pavilion, your friend, Jenna, asks you to help her find someone with psynergy (or  psy chic e nergy ) to get Felix (Latin word for Lucky or Happy, but this guy's mostly unlucky right now. He's Jenna's brother) who is trapped in the river, hanging onto a pole with his life.  You find an adept who is ready to save Felix. When you finally take them to the river, it's too late.  The boulder falls and Felix is swept away. No more Felix. Jenna's brother, and her parents who were attempting to help Felix, are dead. Your father, also in the attempt to save Felix, is dead too. Four people dead in one day; not good.  You go east, because there's no other way out of that area, and two people are talking. A mystery man and woman appear, and they seem to have extraordinary power. They are evil adepts, who used their power to break inside the Sol Sanctum (the large house of worship next to your hometown) and accidentally caused a trap to summon the storm, since they were looking for the source of all alchemy.  They spot you and accuse you of eavesdropping. They knock you out.  Three years later...  You're helping fix the roof of Dora's house, and Jenna and your other friend, Garet, are talking about the incident 3 years back.  You are going to Professor Kraden's house. The old man who lives across the bridge. You plan to sneak into the Sol Sanctum and basically do the same thing as the Mystery people did. But the Mystery people are lurking behind you, little do you know.  You wander around the Sol Sanctum, and you find a secret room with four precious gems (or stars). These gems contain the purest essence of alchemy.  The Mercury Star - Water The Venus Star - Earth The Mars Star - Fire The Jupiter Star - Wind  You're sent out to get these and you get 3 of the 4 when, uh-oh, the mystery people come. They reveal themselves as Saturos and Menardi. And they have someone in charge of them: Alex. They bring in a prisoner mystery man. They also bring along a prisoner. They take 3 of the 4 and make you get the last star for them.  As soon as you pull the last star, the water drains, and a rock shaped eye floats, and Mt. Aelph is about to erupt. Alex and the others take Kraden and Jenna, along with none other than Felix, whom they saved from the storm three years ago.  You get out of the sanctum, because the floating eye, The Wise One, teleports you out of there. You tell your story to the town elders and take your quest to retrieve the four gems, before the lighthouses are lit by them.  You leave town, do all these quests, and go north to meet Ivan, a wind adept. He joins your group, you go further north, and you reach a town called Imil. There you meet Mia, a water adept. So now you have one adept of each.  You are too late to stop Saturos from lighting the lighthouse, so you defeat him there, and Alex revives him, saying that the lighthouse was to blame, because water puts out fire.  You travel south, where you meet Master Hamma. She teaches you a couple psynergy tricks. You go further south, to a town called Lalivero, where you find out a girl named Sheba was kidnapped by Alex and the others.  Then you travel further south, where an old man named Babi, who has lived 150 years, needs draught from Lemuria. He gives you his boat under the condition that you find the continent for him. He says that if you're not quick enough, he will die.  You travel to the top of the Venus Lighthouse, and you meet them  before  they light it this time. You defeat both, and they drop the star into the lighthouse. They change into a dragon because earth is fire's strength, and you battle a two-headed dragon.  You beat the dragon, and Sheba falls off the lighthouse. Felix jumps to save her, and a wave safely carries them to a peninsula.  And you're sent west on a boat to look for the lost continent of Lemuria.   End Book One   -----------------------------    Golden Sun: Book Two    First you started off as Isaac, now you start off as Felix. You're on a floating peninsula, and it gets knocked into a continent by a tidal wave. All the boats in that supercontinent are destroyed.  With Felix, your mission is to light the lighthouses. The exact opposite of what you had to do in the first book. But pretty soon you see his point of view.  You travel around looking for a boat, but every single one is destroyed by the tidal wave.  Alright, this is where things get annoying. You see a boat, but you don't know how to ride it, and it won't run anyway.  You find a man named Piers who will lend you a boat if you get him out of jail. He actually is innocent anyway, and they let him go before you get back.  He goes into a tribal area, because they stole his black orb, thethingy that makes his boat go. He joins your group.  So you basically do that stuff and get the black orb and ride around. You search the pieces of the trident, and you have to do that in the three towers to the gods. Anyway, you get to the top of the towers and get the trident pieces, get them welded together, and go to the center of the Eastern Sea: Lemuria. Of course, after defeating Poseidon with the trident.  It really lets you down. All that work getting there, and the people are too lazy for even time to move, and Parliament is too conservative to let anything happen. The king lets you leave Lemuria, and you're off to the Western sea.  You find a town called Contigo. You travel around and find out Master Hamma is there. You go north to light the Jupiter Lighthouse.  You meet up with the gang from Book One. They're caught in Karst and Agatio's trap. Karst and Agatio are basically recruits who replaced Saturos and Menardi, only they're stronger.  They call you betrayers, you beat them up, and they drop the star in, and steal the last star and go north, to their hometown: Prox. Isaac and friends join your team. You have 8 people now: 2 adepts of each element.  Once you get down from the Jupiter Lighthouse, Ivan learns that Master Hamma is his sister. Short story there, not worth talking about.  Okay, you go north, and get on top of the Mars Lighthouse Aerie, (after taking the star back from Karst and Agatio). Now the Wise One meets you up there. He calls you betrayers too. I guess you can't do anything right.  He sends in a three headed dragon, and you beat it.  It dies, and the three heads turn into three adepts: Jenna's parents and Isaac's dad. They are on the brink of death.  You throw the star in, and it lights the last lighthouse. You've done it. You beat the game.  All the families are reunited and you live hapily ever after.  You see a cutscene of Alex climbing Mt. Aelph to harvest the power from the beams of the lighthouses, and he is bound to the mountain by the Wise One, and the mountain sinks into the earth.  Alex is dead...Or is he?   End Book Two
