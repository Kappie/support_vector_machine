Whenever it gets dark and there are not as many people around... Then things get more depressing.  It's just the way things are when you're alone.  Today we went to church.  Went to Perkins.  Went to Target.  Got some Legos.  Legos are wonderful.  I'm starting back up with my Legos.  We also got a TiVo at Best Buy.  A little confusing to set up.  Moved the Xbox back here downstairs.  The Xbox Live works with it down here too.  I think I'll play it more now.  My throat still hurts.  It began to hurt on Saturday morning.  Hasn't stopped since.  I can feel the flem in my throat... So I know that theres some buildup in there.  Sorry to disgust you if you're reading this.  I don't really have much more to say.  School begins back up on Tuesday.  Tomorrow is Labor Day.  I plan on sitting around and doing nothing.  -19640.77 -1965.76
