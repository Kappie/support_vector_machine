Total drenched when i boarded the bus. Met freddie. And realised that the rain stopped when we were in the bus. The both of us felt like idiots.. -.-" Pon chinese, studied with weichong again. But only did 4 maths GP questions. =P  had an enjoyable time with him. like always? lolx  Tml, i have avac duties in the morn.  bB first aid class to conduct in the afternoon. Meet-the-parents session in the afternoon. Prayer and sharing in the evening. Dinner with the birthday guys in the bB. =D weichong still jio me go study with him.. Need to fly from jj to shuqun and to jj and back to shuqun. -.-"  oh ya. copied some stuff from sarah's blog:  10. finally got our PW survey going. got it approved. printed. in the midst of gathering forms. ---> http://www.papayapolls.com/x/4p5jix  please do them~  11. dennis ong and warren teo. i bicker with them everyday in school. just like with isaac at home. spitfire in training. can get tiring arguing with two animals. seals and walruses shouldn exist. just wasting resources and space. shouldn make home at jj. but i think mandai zoo wouldn want them either. oh well. --> i don understand why i should be item number 11 when i should be placed at number 1?!~  12. the seal sent a lovely greeting sunday morning. 'love God and trust him with all your heart' a good reminder to kickstart the sabbath day. seals can be adorable sometimes. but its so rare. --> Ya.. squirtles too. lolx~  Sarah invited me to join our jjc's prayer group. Mr chin encouraged it too. So.. =D  there goes my sleep and free mercs ride to skool..  Gonna do some work.  Adios babes and hunkz.
