Saw everybody over the weekend, it was good times had by all.   I'm really into the Tour De France and watching Lance get his 6th staright. It's on LIVE at 8:00am CST on OLN. It's repeated pretty much throughout the day. He got into first today so, go Lance!   I'll leave you with this picture today...I thought it was interesting.  Late. -B
