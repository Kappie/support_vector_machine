Or is there something else that is lacking in order to complete this equation..      Today was just another day where it seemed like i wasn't alive. Simple day with hardly any real interactions with people face-to-face, everything but was of mere conversations through text and pictures. I realise the time on this kind of days past by more slowly then normal, why though i still wonder.      On days where i am with people it is of a different matter altogether. Be it a whole day or just a short hour, it seems like time flies when theres interaction with other human beings whilst in their prescence.       Why do some days feel and seem shorter then others? Does it really mean that time flies when your having fun? Our time on this earth is short and limited. Many times i have heard people lamenting about how their lives suck or how much they just wish to die.. If i could i would show them what i see, about how limited our time on this life actually is and how many things there is to be done. Compared to people whose lives have been taken away from them unwillingly, here we have selfish people wishing for theirs to be taken away.   I guess we really like to take things for granted...      You will lose your life eventually one day. Choose the way to go when its the end. Either be a loser who never once saw the bright of life, or be someone who realised how precious it can be.. People often tell me to slow down, to stop thinking so much. Personally when humans dont think thats when they err..       We dont think about where we are going, what we are doing and most importantly of the consequences. We say many things which we never mean to do eventually and we do many things which we come to realise and regret after the consequences are clear. Many times in life i have made that mistake and awful a mistake it is to make. To realise that there could have been another alternative and to have been able to be better. Or to realise that it could have been worse and to have ended up in a lousier situation.      Instead of feeling that i am thinking too much, maybe, just maybe, i should feel that i am thinking too little and i should think more....      "Time slips through hands like water on glass,    people feel that they have too many hours.   Minutes to kill, seconds to spare,   when they finally stop breathing, i hope they wont despair,   that time was too little, it just wasn't fair..."
