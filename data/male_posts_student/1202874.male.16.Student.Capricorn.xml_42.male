(i apologize to the ladies that may be reading this...) and visiting sites like  tightcherries.com  good job kid. but it got a good laugh from everybody especially tom's mom. so then when eric comes home tom starts asking him if he's eaten any cherries lately. instantly the kid gets a shifty look on his faith but like a true bedford citizen never admits it. i'm laughing about it. so time passes and ms scibana's speaking of... there's some cherry jam in the fridge. we're like yay! cherries we love the cherrie jam. (again sorry to any black ladies that may be reading this) ms scibana corrects herself and says its black cherry jam. toms like "ewww. blackcherries... your sick mom".  it got a good laugh. anywho i'm out like the hosts of queer eye for the straight guy.
