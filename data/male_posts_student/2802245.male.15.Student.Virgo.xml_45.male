Must update you on the more interesting side of work:  There are many customers who buy stuff from the place (obviously). I have divided them into groups:   [a] The T-Rexes -  They only buy meat. Meat. More Meta and M - E - A - T. Meaty meat. Big chunks, small chunks, oh and fish! But thats still meat, right? So Meat and fish. Cold meat, frozen meat, seafood, shrimps, fish, lobsters, big flat flatfish the size of a tennis racket... [you get the picture, okay?!]   [b] The Vegans -  I' not gonna go very far. These people buy VEGS! Thats it. No cans, no meat, no nothing but vegs and fruit. Like, eat some meat will ya?   [c] The Can Lovers  - usually crazy looking bastards who looooooooooooove cans. Like, their whole shopping composes of, guess what... cans. Canned fish, canned vegs, Cans made out of tofu, canned stick insects, canned cans, canned flaming dead black sheep, fried cans, broken flying cans that serve soup and loooks for terrorists, but nothing else. The last 6 I mentioned were not true, but you get the picture. ¬_¬   [d] The crazy son of a b%hes who buys the entire shop -  No explaination. Just bad luck for thr people who have to pack bags. That would be me *cough* >:(   [e] The utter dumbass  - Okay, I've seen one of those. This black woman orders some chicken legs, a bag of them. She walks around the shop while they are being delivered. The chicken legs are then put into a trolley by a guy. He then leds the woman back to the trolley telling her,  Theres the legs madam."  The man walks away.  The woman looks into the trolley  and says,  "Whos shopping is this? Anyway, wheres my chicken legs?"  ROFLMAO!!!!1!1  Sorry, I don't get much excitement in work. Yes, I know. Its not funny. But believe me, after working 4 or 5 hours non stop, anything is funny.  Except more work. Yeah.  ...  I'mprobably ordering a new mp3 player very soon. Probably next Monday. Its going to a the Monolith II 7010 512Mb Black Aluminium version. Plus some Sennhieser MX 500 Stero earphones, if I can affored 'em. They are expensive at £20, but apparently their sound quality is dead on explosive. Sounds like the earphones fore me :D The only bad thing about the mp3 player is that it doesn't support OGG Vorbis encoding. Arrrrrrghh, I'm not stuck with MP3 am I??! OGG vorbis (or is it vobis? I can't remember) is faaaaar better than MP3. It's smaller than a MP3 song yet sounds better.  urlLink www.monolith-europe.com  has some pics of the black monolith player. Pretty neat, no?  In all due respect James, here ya go. A nice long post. Now off to Ghosanomics for some updates. well after dinner actaully. I need some refuelling before I can function properly again. You have no idea how much energy 9 hours of work needs.    Tribute to thy ROFLMAOCOPTERness, (yes, I know its rofocopter, :/)    Jamie
