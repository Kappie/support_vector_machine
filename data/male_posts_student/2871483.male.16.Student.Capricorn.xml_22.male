All the time, every day, I'm lying.  I even lie to people I don't even know, who don't even care if I have a boring life, or that I'm just a fucking moron.  It's a terrible habit, I do it even without thinking.  But I feel as if nobody would like me or even care about who I was if I didn't make anything up.    It's hard to stop, though, I'm so used to it.  But I'm getting so tired of putting on a show for everyone, being fake.  It's not fun.  I hope none of you hate me for this, but I'd understand if you did, and didn't want to ever talk to me again.  I'm going to start over.  No more lies.    Please forgive me.
