I got to play disc-golf (my brother's portable thing), My friend got to come over even though he's grounded, and I got to see a couple of my favorite people (Alyson  Al). I love getting to see them and talk with them. They are like my other parents, but they're goofy enough to be my friends also [they're awesome!] So yeah I learned more about the "Arin's House" thing. It sounds really kool and I want to help out. Oh Oh Oh...  Invitations to some people to come hang out with me  [Warning: no one will probably see this so all these invitations are pointless, but then if you think about it so is this webpage. LoL] Any way the following people I have taken an interest in hanging out with them sometime [this means we all gotta do something and I'll find a way to get a hold of all of you and i'll figure out what we could do too]  The List Christine Eva Minh Nicole Haley Inga Scott McDonald Bobby  Kacyee Kirk Jessica  Lauren Erica Rachel Tracy Heather Kim  That's all I can think of for now. So I'll figure out something to do and makes some telephone calls and make it happen.  P.S. if you hadn't noticed most of the people on "The List" are from Westview... go figure. LoL.  Well talk to ya'll soon [i hope]  Catch you cats on the flip flop later (that movie never gets old)
