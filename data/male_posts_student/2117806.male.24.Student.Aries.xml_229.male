Why are other comics and sites  allowing  said crappy comics to advertise?  Why is it Adam and I are so damn poor?  If we weren't so poor, we could afford advertising with popular sites.  What advertising would actually get us--aside from the possibility of increased readership, which currently wouldn't mean a whole lot except more readers--is still a question I myself am pondering.  Okay, done with the whiney griping/bitching.  I'm gonna go for a bike ride now.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Dire Straits, "On Every Street"
