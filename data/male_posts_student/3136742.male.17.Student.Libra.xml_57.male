Here's the most recent. a few minutes ago i received an email saying that this girl i knew in college, erin schlather, died in a car accident on monday morning. no other cars were involved - she evidently hit a guardrail, and then flipped over into a ravine filled with 4 feet of water. i don't think they've yet determined the exact cause of death, i can only hope it was quick. i wasn't extremely close to erin or anything, but i remember her well, since she dated one of my good friends for awhile. she was an amazing singer, and was pitch in one of the a capella bands at vassar. she was smart too - recently she had been working at the non-profit center for strategic and international studies (CSIS) in DC, and was about to start law school full-time at georgetown in the fall. but mostly, i just remember her being one of the sweetest, kindest, most adorable people you could ever care to know. as someone who, luckily, has not had to deal much with deaths of friends or family in my life, i never know how to respond to this type of news. so i started this thread. RIP erin be safe out there everyone.  ok... Look dude... I really don't care about Erin. She's just another statistic to me... What? Oh, shit! Erin Died!? on the road?!... I'm gonna be safer now.... seriously, what the fuck does this accomplish? and then everyone responds "I'm sorry dude. I bet she was a wonderful person"... Hell, I aint fucking apologizing for anything. I didn't kill the bitch. And just because she's dead doesn't mean she was a good person... I'm sure that's not what people on another message board were saying when her ex-boyfriend told his internet-buddies that she cheated on him. Erin was probably a bitch. Not only do I not care about Erin (and you said yourself she wasn't a close friend, so why do you care?), but I hope you get diarrhea for expecting me to care and expecting me to apologize...   People, you all need to realize that death is a natural fucking process. Just like having a baby, just like cumming, just like taking a shit. It happens. Get over it. I can be sympathetic and compassionate when the situation calls for it, and this, most fucking definitely, does not call for it. Nothing Erin, or any of your dead friends (unless then invented some goddamned vaccine) ever had any affect on me. I never knew 'em, so I don't care... Now, if your infant child has cancer, that's another thing. That I'd feel for. Or maybe if a tremendously significant person in your life dies. But give me a break with this "someone I know just died in a car accident." That's just one more out of the thousands, Bub.
