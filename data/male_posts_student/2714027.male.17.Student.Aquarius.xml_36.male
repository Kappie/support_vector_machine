The last week has been as busy as usual really, with school work getting more and more demanding by the day with our major exams only a couple of months away. The thought of it alone scares the crap out of me! I'm taking Computing, Physics, Maths and Geography and I'm aiming to get A, B, A, A in those respectively. It's going to need a hell of a lot of revision though, and I picked up an interesting technique from someone else the other day. The guy told me that he'd revised Physics by recording himself saying the devinitions and then slept while listening to them. Sounds like a great, if undoubtedly weird idea.  A few days ago my dad brought a laptop home from work to use at home. They had enough for everyone to have them, so he took the chance to put his name down for one. It's a really nice one as well - 2.66Ghz, 512MB RAM, 60GB HD - and we've put in a wireless LAN card so that I can sit here now on the sofa we don't use much and write my blog, wire free. Well, except for the power lead because I don't want the energy hungry machine to shut down on me. I can see myself at university in a couple of years time, surfing the net wirelessly from some student building, chillin' with some friends after a long day's work. Isn't technology great?  The end of the week wasn't really a usual one. On Thursday evening I went out with my school's Army Cadet Force to a training area about 20 miles away. We did various exercises and then slept in a very cold wood on a hillside somewhere. It wasn't particularly enjoyable, but at least it didn't rain. During Friday, we did a few more exercises including minefield clearance and building a rope runway. Don't ask me why I do cadets, because I don't really know. It's a mixture of it looking good on my university application form and the strange appeal of going back to basics that keep me in it.  Saturday brought a wedding, one of my parent's best friends. The bride of about 30 is our hairdresser and the groom has worked with my dad for about ten years or more. It was an interesting service, with a few unusual hymns but nothing too out of the ordinary. Then back to the reception where I had to dodge a few old folk who just sit there and say 'yeeesss' and 'ooohhh' to whatever the hell you say. But to be honest though, most of the people were pretty good and talkative, and it was an enjoyable experience. I got rather bloated with chocolate and alcohol at one point, but managed to gently deflate to my normal state.  At about 9.30pm I left for a party and arrived there when most people were pissed already. There was an unusual amount of alchol there in comparison to other parties I've been to and the beer never ran out. There were more gals than guys which was good, but I couldn't pluck up the courage to make a move on one that I liked, damn me. Round about midnight, I called it a night and went off home where I slept for a good ten hours and then woke up to write this. Well, I woke up and then wrote this, not woke up to write it.  Anyway, a couple of things have come across my mind when writing this. Firstly, why to keys on a keyboard have the characters printed in the top left corner of the keys? Secondly, why does the writing on this laptop with it's TFT/XGA/whatever screen look more rounded and fuzzy than on my CRT monitors upstairs? Food for thought I think, and taling of food I'm hungry so I must depart to fill a growing cavity in my stomach. Good day to you all.
