Her older sister is America’s sweetheart; comfortably dumb enough to push commercial success, which in turn makes millions comfortable enough to accuse Ashlee of riding her wave. Considering Ashlee’s picture-perfect timing (dropping her album midway through  Newlywed’s  season 2), those millions have an argument, but “Autobiography”s moral seems to be that breaking through Jessica’s PG-rated seal is nothing less than a challenge. Sisterhood has been at fault lately, evidence being the Olsen anorexia scare and the forced inclusion of Haylie Duff on Hillary’s weak “Our Lips are Sealed” cover, which is just more pressure to mount against any potential Ashlee Simpson solo triumph.  Finally, and maybe most importantly, is that aforementioned seal being PG. John Shanks (the “Autobiography” producer) has previously coached Michelle Branch (check out that Maxim spread), Alanis Morissette (sample “You Oughta Know” lyric: “Are you thinking of me when you fuck her?”), and Sheryl Crow (check out that Stuff spread), none of whom exactly blend right in with Ashlee’s expected virgin Mary image.  Still, even with all that considered, Ashlee finds clever ways around the patented image that is her sister, which are annoying in the real world (black hair?) but surprisingly delightful in the musical realm, making “Autobiography” a worthy and interesting listen, albeit a case-by-case, hit-or-miss patchwork of twelve packaged tracks.     To Ashlee’s advantage, she hits best in cases when she hits hard, and she can really hit hard. To her disadvantage, though, she spends too much time softening up, and, at the other end of the spectrum, she can really get soft (we’re talking haiku Jewel). The album’s opening third then becomes both astounding and disappointing, because while it is like a platter of Ashlee’s best songwriting and lyrical skills, it sets the bar very high for the remaining eight songs. The title track is much deeper than it sounds as the theme song to  The Ashlee Simpson Show . Starting bitterly, a crawling bass foreshadows the brilliant chorus, pure indie funk chug with that synth guitar from the Cars’  “Just What I Needed” lurking in the background. Ashlee’s tender and frank delivery, perhaps, is the song’s convincing aspect, as she rambles through both flirtation and heartbreak effortlessly.  “Pieces of You” and “Shadow” both outdo their respective familiarities, the latter trumping Christina’s Grammy-winning “Beautiful” (although it does sound suspiciously similar), the former mixing folky Jewel and Jason Mraz’s “The Remedy” into one hell of a headlining single. Actually, “Shadow” should be the album’s second single, a brilliant quasi-ballad and album standout that hopefully won’t be kept from radio just because of its Jessica-bashing lyrics (“I was stuck inside someone else’s life/and always second best”). But easily most shocking is “La La,” a wildly aggressive track about, well, more than kissing. Ashlee’s homage to Hole is undeniable as she rambles through lines like “I like it better when it hurts” and equates herself to a “French maid” and an “alley cat,” brilliantly sexing her way through a Donnas-inspired guitar thrash. The listener, inevitably, is left higher than he/she (actually just he) ever thought he’d be, starting to consider (okay, fantasize about) the doubled “e” porn-star spelling of Miss Simpson’s now more-hot-than-cute name.   Higher highs only make for lower lows, though, as both “Love Makes the World Go Round” and “Better Off” prove. “Love Makes…” sounds like Jimmy Eat World’s “In the Middle” at a third the pace, and “Better Off” just can’t find a decent melody. So, halfway through the album, bipolarity has settled for better and for worse, conveniently in that order. What becomes notable, though, is that Ashlee has so exceeded sub-par expectations that you’re suddenly fighting for her, not against her, which subtly shows that her music speaks louder than her MTV-recorded words. And while you fight for her, she fights by imitation, wearing wigs and playing dress-up to alt rock’s greater goddesses, a strategy that works well, like an audible version of “I Want a Famous Face.”      Ashlee once again pleases with tracks like “Unreachable,” in which she works up a sexy jazz steam over a “Criminal”-reminiscent piano lick (Fiona). The chorus is beautifully melodic and Ashlee is surprisingly witty (“got me heels over head”), combining to make this piece the album’s diamond in the rough. Similarly, “Love Me for Me” instantly brings Maroon 5’s “Harder to Breath” to mind, but culminates in an Audioslave-worthy chorus (which may actually be degrading Cornell  Co. more than it is praising Ashlee). “Nothing New” begins with a fast, Nirvana-meets-“Hand in My Pocket” guitar line as Ashlee croons into a Natalie Imbruglia impression (seriously, almost dead-on) for the “Wishing I Was There”-rewrite refrain, and a final highlight is “Surrender,” much-publicized on her television show, which puts together the electro-funk of Puddle of Mudd’s “Blurry” with a surprisingly bluesy midsection.   All in all, Ashlee Simpson looks not to ride her sister’s fame but to dodge it, which much of “Autobiography” succeeds in doing. She has the singles and much of the bulk to make this is a killer debut, even if she is more the wild-card of the Simpson family. Yes, the album drags out poorly (the closing duo is nothing more than average). But for such an inexperienced artist, she really brings a lot of writing talent to the table, including words that at times can be hotter than Jessica’s body. About a minute into the first track, Ashlee claims to have “a million subtleties.” While a lyric like that could end some artists’ careers (hell, if R. Kelly shared all his subtleties, no one would ever piss alongside him again), it only levitates Ashlee’s. Fact is, with her little secrets, you might want to get to know many, if not every single one.
