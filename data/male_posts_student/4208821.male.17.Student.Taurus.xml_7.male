Being raised as a Catholic, morality has always been part of my life, despite rarely attending church in the last year or two. Work ethic is also extemely important to me, and I firmly believe in individualism and capitalism for this reason. I also firmly believe in defense of the nation.  What I don't understand about the present period of time is the amount of personal hatred directed towards the President. Why is the vocal minority (read: the left) taking Bush's being in office so personally? And the comparisons to Hitler are just horrendous. Last time I checked Bush wasn't rounding up any ethnic groups and killing them en masse, a la Hitler. The disagreement on issues does not equate hatred for one another, and the usage of military force does not make a leader Hitler-esqe.  I support Bush's "War on Terrorism" not from being a "blind loyalist" but as a well-educated individual. Regardless of Iraq's involvement with the 9/11 attacks, Saddam required consequence for his actions in the past. Hell, even both presidential candidates agree with each other that they still would have gone to war in Iraq based on today's intelligence. It was the right thing to do, and WMD was only one part of the reasons to go to war, along with the liberation of the Iraqi people from a tyrrant who killed hundreds of thousands of his own people with chemical munitions in the 1980's. UN Resolutions in the Security Council approving the war were vetoed by none other than those countries who were engaged corrupt oil for food programs with Iraq. Saddam also supported the families of Palestinian suicide bombers which is simply staggering to say he wasn't tied to terrorism. Even if he had no signifigant ties to one group, his being in power was a beacon of anti-American sentiment in the mid-East who would probably aid terrorist factions.  I just don't feel that Kerry can handle the war, and keep pressure on the Islamo-fascists of the world would would love to see every woman wearing a burka. I feel Kerry's stance is that which is appeasement of the international community.  As for the cost of Freedom at home, I disagree with some of the Patriot Act. The ability to detain anyone and deny them access to a lawyer is rather scary. However, there are clauses in the Patriot Act which do allow the government a deal more flexibility in information sharing between bureaus. However, I refuse to blame only Bush for the Patriot Act due to the two houses of Congress and the Supreme Court which allow a beautiful thing called checks and balances. Freedom is more important than security, however, I'll spare the use of an overused Benjamin Franklin quote that we all know by now.  I will not criticize the government for sending out terror level warnings, because before 9/11 it was that the government didn't do enough.  The hypocrisy spouted by critics of the terror alerts hurts my head.  Now it's just the opposite, that the terror alerts are a "fascist attempt to keep everyone living in fear".  I, for one, feel safer now, and do not worry at all about terror attacks.   Abortion. I disagree strongly with abortions past the first trimester, unless of course in cases of rape, or cases in which the life of the mother is threatened by the birth of a child.  Stem Cell Research is going to be the next medical revolution, and I'm excited about it, which is why I'm disappointed with Bush's ban on stem cell research.  I also strongly disagree with an Amendment banning gay marriage. The Bill of Rights was designed to protect the rights of citizens, not restrict them. Gay marriage bans also step into the grey area at which lies the combination of church-based morals and state.  The economy is strengthening. I cannot believe that people blame Bush alone for the amount of jobs lost. His unemployment rate is that of Clinton's when he left office in 2001. Remember the 90's and the artificial stock market bubble created by web start ups? Yeah, it popped, and we're only starting to recover. The economy is a cyclical thing so ups and downs are expected. Greenspan, who is as nonpartisan as you can get, even thinks that the lull in the summer months is only temporary.  Interest rates have been the lowest in 40 years during Bush's term, home ownership is up.  Jobs are returning, if Bush leaves office this year on an economic high note that continues rising, Kerry will probably get the credit for it.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who would read this and still say "Fuck Bush". You can't please everyone.
