Maybe not necessarily in terms of how much schoolwork I have to do, but in terms of how much stuff I have going on and how hard it's been to keep up on everything.  I mean, honestly, this is the least # of credits that I've ever taken (15), but three of my five classes are relatively reading-intensive, and I don't know what it is but it just seems like I can't read like I used to.  Maybe I need to have my eyes checked, maybe it's the fact that I'm actually trying to learn what I'm reading (since we don't really go over much of what we read in class) but I'm probably only reading at about 1/3 the pace that I'm used to.  Grr...  Of course, the fact that I'm relatively disinterested in virtually all of my classes doesn't help very much.  I would say that Conflict Management is probably about the only class that I get "up" for (ok, maybe Direct Dem., but that's more due to who's in the class...); all the rest are honestly on things that I couldn't care less about.  And political science reading is boring to begin with, so adding a low level of interest only makes it twice as bad.  It could also be the fact that I think I'm getting lazier, or at least less driven by academic success.  As I near the "end" of my academic "career," I look back and wonder if what I was taught was really what I needed to learn; it seems like I was stuffed full of facts and figures, philosophies and rationalizations, but I was never taught about the more human side of things, the things that  mean  something.  And now I wonder if all that really matters are those things I haven't learned, because what I have learned certainly doesn't seem to have given me any sense of joy or purpose.    So now I sit here and silently plead for a deeper meaning to what I learn, a transcendence between academic knowledge and the personal relationships that give life figure and fullness.  At the very least I want to learn things that I believe to be true, things that help me to be a better man, a better person, a better me.  I want to have my "life questions" answered by someone that I trust, someone who I know is not only smart but wise.    And so I realize that all of this time spent in classrooms really means very little, that I have not learned that which I seek answers to, that what education I have received has left me ill-prepared to address such questions.  For the answers I seek are found in wisdom, not knowledge; in relationship, not academia; in discernment, not perception.  I pray that I might find these answers once I am finished with this tortuous path called "school;" I know that I probably will not even begin to see them before.  For the answers that I seek are not expressed in books or theories, or even in words or reason, but in the life that one lives, in the relational touches that mold and shape our lives with fingers no one sees, in the quiet stillness at the end of the day when one has opportunity to reflect on the simple joys of life that transcend what we do and strike to the very depths of our hearts, there speaking in a language of communion with those we love and our God.  These are the things that I want to learn...
