After no less than four of my relatives insinuated I was a girl, my mom vandalized my car. I  did , however, get some pie. Then, I left.  I've been playing guitar a lot lately. It seems to be an even better catharsis than blogging. Listening to music is probably the only thing that is more cathartic to me than guitar. I enjoy it, the simple task of setting my fingers in the right place for a chord. Instead of approaching the guitar with the passion for music I have, I instead started trying approaching it as a student, a workman. This seems to have improved my guitar playing, so I'll stick with it.  Due to me waking up late, I didn't get much accomplished.  I went to the late show with John and Pammy. The movie was  The Terminal , and I enjoyed it, even though it grated on me at the end.   Terminal  is a very sterile movie. The shots themselves remind me of a airport, clean and orderly, with a comforting conformity to everything. This bothered me throughout the whole movie. It does fit quite well with the movie, but you think such an acclaimed director would try something new and original. I suspect that good actors and scripts have led people to believe that Spielberg is a better director than he actually is. Tom Hanks is good in it, as usual. The awkwardness between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones  almost  felt real. It always bothers me when movie relationships seem natural, especially when the people first meet.   So that was my day.  I also was a Groundbreaking Documentary, both on Tickle and in real life twice as "The Josh Mattson Story", and as the crazy Hannah stalker video project (I don't know the real name).  Oh, and according to Tickle, I value religions that encourage open-mindedness.  I hope it is nice out tomorrow. I'd like to go swimming.  What is going on now? I don't really know anymore. I never have had a strong sense of self-identity. I just always believed I was what I was. Now, who knows? My life is like a living version of  Catch-22  where no one knows what the hell is going on. You know, I'm cool with that. I no longer fear the uncertain as much as I used to. I'm on a plateau, waiting for a big change.   I've always intellectually realized that I could die any time, but in my heart I don't really believe that. I can't imagine dying  ever . I'm not talking about my so-called immortal soul, I mean my physical body. It is hard to brood on something that seems so far away. But hey, when I was a little kid I figured I would be dead long before I was 16. Time plays funny tricks. Maybe in a short while I will realize that I am 40 and long to be 16 again.  Who wants to grow old? For that matter, who wants to grow up? I loathe responsiblity and I imagine that I always will.   Change  is the dirtiest word in any language.   On Chris Derby's blog: El Jefe: Holy Shit you are a whinner. I dont know you and I already hate you Chris: Fuck You Josh: That shit's wack, brah  I'm  much  too arrogant to fall into self-loathing, and Chris shouldn't either. We've had our differences, but he isn't such a bad guy. I used to hate everything too, until I realized that shit isn't going to change if I sit around and hate it so I might as well accept the things I can't change.   I'm glad I can go back and edit posts. I just deleted all of this here.  In other news, I hate pinball.  I hate it when you see people, but then you realize that it is just someone who looks like them. I go up and greet friends all the time only too realize that I don't know the person.  Well, I finished  Kavalier , which was quite good. I've now started to finish  Neuromancer , by William Gibson.  I've got nothing else to blog tonight, Raow.
