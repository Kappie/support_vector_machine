In the case of  Love Actually  (  urlLink Rotten Tomatos,   urlLink IMDB  ) you get nine fantastic movies for the price of one. They are all based on semi-stereotypical characters and almost cliched storylines, but this serves as a way of allowing the director to explore the romantic comedy genre. Comparing this to  urlLink Scream  would be taking it a notch too far, but it does poke fun of itself in the same way. Lines about movies, a fairy tale ending and closing scenes coupled with the tagline "The ultimate romantic comedy" clearly highlights the intentions of this film.  One of the things that makes this venture into fairy land so special, and credible, is the fantastic acting on the behalf of the stunning cast.  urlLink Hugh Grant  plays the mischievious and lovable Prime Minister with impeccible comic timing.  urlLink Colin Firth  make's an almost farcical (and ironically least comic) story line seem realistic and believable.  urlLink Emma Thompson  managed to give reason to the script, without over powering it. The last role I saw her in was as Beatrice in  urlLink Much Ado About Nothing  and although the two characters are externally very differant, they are intrinsically similar. The only time the acting faltered was with the children, but this is to be expected.  The direction was excelent for  urlLink  Richard Curtis'  first outing. In saying this there were flaws, such as the irregular pace and perhapse too fairy tale story which left you longing for more scandal, or at least someone getting dumped.   In all a hilarious charming formulaic romantic comedy that doesnt take its self too seriously.   92/100   I'm sure Caroline will most likely describe this movie some what along the lines of "A venture into Mike's mind"
