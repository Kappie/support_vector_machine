That and helping find crappuy fake IDs for kids in Chinatown (for the low low price of only forty five dollars!). Got my mom a gift too.  Studying for Arabic tests, which occur every monday, is not fun though. That is why I'm posting here, in a deliberate effort to waste time and do something else. I really need to begin studying  before  nine pm.  No more english in class is also frightening.   But I cannot dally too long, as I will not allow myself to outwit myself so obviously. No, I must cunningly divert my attention through a whole multitude of semi involved activities that each take a little time, not one that takes alot. The point appears to go to me this round, eh me! I'm a tricky one, thats for sure.  And for god's sake, someone cheer up Christyn. I can't be out emoed on my own blog, now can I? Make the poor girl smile, or some show other facial expression for the more daring/risque of you thrill seekers.   Thats all you get for now. Wasn't it so not worth an update?
