My dear sister Beatrice came back from teaching English in Japan on the 23rd of December, and about an hour after she came into the house, our brother Roly, whom we'd only met like twice or so, rang us. Normally this bloke resides in Tasmania, but apparently he was in Adelaide for some Ford dealer conference or something. Anyway, evidently he was on his mobile, as the signal dropped out. About ten minutes later, the phone rang - we all knew it was him - and Beatrice answered the phone with a hearty " KONNICHIWASTRANGEJAPANESEPHRASEYWAA!! " and the voice on the other side (apparently) said:  "G'day, this is your big brother... ... .... .....Denis"  Farken  Within an hour, we (myself, Beatrice and Angus, my flatmate and Beatrice's ex) were all travelling up to Blakeview to a barbeque with Roly and Denis. When we get there, we're introduced to Jon....  another  brother... and to Sharon (go, I hope that's the right name!), his wife.... and their two kids.  Faaarken  So anyway, we had a pre-christmas barbeque lunch and left at about 6pm or thereabouts.  [insert two days here]  Boxing Day comes along, and Roly  Denis take myself and Beatrice out to lunch, which consisted of a large meal at the Eros Cafe on Rundle Street, followed by (lots of) drinks at the Austral hotel up the street, followed by a trip to Kirsty's place for a singalong and a catching up with Alex and Angus before heading off to the pub around the corner (Earl of Leicester) for more drinks, another large meal, followed by more drinks. All in all, the lunch lasted for twelve hours.  Faaaaaaarken.  Now, just to clarify things, this is how my family is made up:     Now then - from my limited understanding of the situation, Roly was given up for adoption for whatever reason - I think Fred (Sigfried) lost his job shortly after he was born. Jon and Denis were taken away from mum  Fred by Family Services after mum had a mental breakdown or something, and placed in foster care.  When mum  Fred got divorced, apparently she went and had a fling with some Dutch guy and Jessica (my sister, not my previous love intrest, ffs!) was the result. He fucked off to Canada for some chick, and mum then met Charles (aka "Tony") who then decided to call Jessica Beatrice. That is to call her by her middle name rather than her first, because he didn't like the name Jessica (sacrelige!). Shortly after that, I popped out.  Between us, we span some 16 or so years - Roly turns 40 this year, Beatrice turns 30, and I turn 24.  farken, ffs.  I got a family for christmas, what did  you  get? =P
