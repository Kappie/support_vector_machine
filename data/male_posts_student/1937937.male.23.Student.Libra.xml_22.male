Pictured to the right, these penises range from the "small" 6-inches to the very large 24-inchers.  My dog, Pooka, who has been featured on this website in the past, is definitely a fan of these penises.  The pet store places a barrel of them right by the front door, and Pooka always follows her nose directly to these strangely shaped cocks.  So the first and most obvious question is: are they naturally 24 inches?  No.  They've been stretched -- and I'd say that's a relief for almost all mankind.  Do we really need that kind of inter-species competition?  What kind of girl would go for that, anyway?  (Hint: the cool kind!)  Actually, one can find bull penises all over the place: apparently, they've been used as walking sticks for many years, and are also an essential ingredient in a certain kind of Jamaican soup.   Another desirable pet accessory: boots.  These boots are available for only $15.95 -- essential to the happiness of any well adjusted dog.  Particularly in Miami.  The pavement can be scorching, and these boots protect a dogs sensitive padded soles from excruciating heat.  Why can't they make human shoes that "fit all breeds"?  Shaq and I definitely can't wear the same shoe; why can Pooka, a chihuaha, wear the same shoes as a great Dane?
