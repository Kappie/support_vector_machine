On Friday, I was prevented from coming online by infexible idiots. You can guess who le la. No need for names.  Okay. I am only covering what happened yesterday. Yesterday was our school's Sports Day. HaHa. We went back to watch. Me, CQ, Joyce, HM, Gloria, KS and XC. WQ, KentKent and Hann joined us later. Hmmm. This time, I feel that we were able to concentrate on the runs more. All those times I've been to Sports Day, all I did was incessant cheering. I didn't even concetrate on who's running and whatnot. Yeah. We were seated at the VIP seats wor. So shuang. HaHa. Anyhoo, we also went to visit our teachers. Mrs Chua, Mrs Jalil, Miss Tan....meow meow! We chatted with them for quite a bit. Hmmm. During the Inter-Department relays, we went down to cheer for the teachers. HaHa. We shouted ourselves crazy! Hmmm. After Sports Day, we went to Causeway Point. I am forbidden to out eatside, so I was about to go home when I smsed Wendy out of curiosity and asked where she is. It turns out that she and Manda are at Causeway, so I went to find them to chat. I had such a great time with them. Miss the old days of chatting with Manda and Wendy. After some walking around, we went back home lor.  Okay. Today. Today morning I was supposed to meet CQ and gang at 8, but because I have to eat breakfast, I can only make it at 8.30. Oh well. When I reached there, CQ, Gloria, Joyce and HM were there le. SL came later. Hmm. We played some basketball. Yeah, the court was full and all, but we 'chap' our way in and got ourself half-a-court. Heh Heh. I dunnoe why leh, but I fumbled with the ball quite a lot of times. I mananged to goal twice, so that's good. Shoryly after, KS arrived. We went down to sit at the fitness corner and talk lor, until XC arrives.  Sigh. What happened next was a series of unfortunate incidents. That idiot hit me with his plastic bag containing his pants. That bag broke (Huo gai, says me and Wendy. Bags are not meant to be used to hit people anyway, so huo gai that his bag broke). It was, of course, deemed as my fault. Yeah right. Like I caused the bag to break. If he didn't hit me with that, it wouldn't have broken in the first place, right? He then made me put the bag into my bag, but my bag was too full of library books to squeeze in useless items. I didn't want to take it, so what he did was grab the hook of my bag and refused to let go. He tried to push me down a cliff, get me knocked down by a car and crash me into a wall. That's not the worst part. The worst part is he inflicted deep wounds onto my arms. He pinched me real hard, causing a moonacle mark on my elbow (I discovered a deep scratch on my wrist, during when I was bathing when I felt that pain... I can sue him for assualt, but I don't have the money to hire a lawyer..Oh well). The scary part was that when he did it, he glared at me with eyes full of mavolence and hatred. I didn't know any human being could possess such frightening emotions, and use them to cause harm to others. The others don't dare to interfere, seeing that XC went totally ballistic (quoted from CQ...frightening creatures, once humans get really mad. XC should be branded as dangerous and locked up indefinitely). It was after some incessant pleading on Gloria's part and me shredding a few tears (dunnoe whether he knew or not la) that he decided to let go.      I kept a huge distance from him for the rest of the day. On the way towards Causeway Point, I was trying my hardest not to cry. Call me weak-willed. Whatever. I don't care. I couldn't control myself when we reached the food court. I was (forcefully) escorted to the toilet to clean up. I calmed down for a bit. Yeah. CQ, Gloria and KS are great friends. They cared for me. :D I had a huge temptation to message Wendy, but afriad of upsetting myself, I didn't. (I did tell her just now though) I suffered all that, to put it basically, due to bullying. Plain and simple. Bullying. I am very prone to bullying, seeing how I couldn't retaliate. CQ asked why I didn't retaliate, and let myself get bullied. How I wish I can. If I retaliate, I am sure to get bullied more. Experience taught me that. Sigh...  Hmm. We had lunch. Actually, I didn't really have a proper lunch. I was too upset and is in no mood to eat something. I only ate ice kacang. Yeah. Anyway, after all, we went up to take NeoPrints. Oh boy. Was I glad that XC and HM (no offense on HM's part, don't take it in the wrong way hor) left to meet Mr Low. I can't stand being with that animal while playing pool.   We went u to play pool wor. Well, I began to relax and enjoy myself. HaHa. TZ joined us later, followed by WQ. HM and XC came later after WQ. My ball skills improved, quite. I started to hit hardly and paying extra attention to my angles. Hmm. Good.   After pooling for 5 hours, me and Gloria left first to go to the library (to return my books), then we went to top-up our cards, then we went home.   I went back, bathed, watched my Sat show, ate dinner then came online. Homework still not touched yet. Heh. I have to do that, plus Chem tutorial, before I come online tomorrow, or else, I'll never have the time to complete them! Yes!   Okay. I gotta go. See ya tomorrow, most probably. Night blog!
