Ahh....I guess eventually I'll get up the courage to just say it. My first day of school is tommarrow. I guess thats good. Its basically a new school, well I was only there for two weeks before summer vacation started, so its still new. I'm a Second Lt. in ROTC for now, and I still have no Idea what I'm going to do there. I have ROTC first period so that's good, oh and this year, well no, until December 23, I get out of school at 1:30, then after that I get out at 12:30. How cool. I'm taking ROTC, Pre-Cal / Cal / Trig, English 12, Government / Economics, then Speech in that order. I know i'll graduate the only thing that bothers me is getting into college, and what i'm going to do with my life after high school and college. I could just join the Marines or Army. But that wouldn't leave a lot of time or room for Crystal or anyone else, if there's anyone that cares and if Crystal and I do move on to a new place in our relationship, and if it were to last that long. So many things to do, so little time to do them. I went shopping yesterday and got lots of new clothes. So I guess that's cool. Then I spent some time with my Dad, something that rarely happens. It was good and all, but it just goes to prove to me that neither one of us has a lot to say to the other. We can barely keep up small talk. Hey, at least we haven't had a boxing match in about 4 months. That's good. I actually slept like a baby after I talked to Crystal last night. Another rarity for me. I actually had dreams that weren't all bad for once. I'm probably going to get a job after school to about 10 or 11. Help keep me out of trouble and away from people. I wish I was back home. As much as El Paso sucked ass, its been home for the greater majority of my life. I had so many life experiences there that its just kinda hard to let go. Besides I think Albuquerque sucks more than anywhere I've been so far. That, and well I'd be close to Crystal. That would make things a lot better. My mom said that if I want to for my birthday, she'll buy me a bus or plane ticket back home and I can do what I want from there. Kinda considering that. I'd be back home, with friends, back into an Army ROTC and........ with Crystal. Now there's something to contemplate.
