Well....uhm, no I guess not. lol After I left I went out to eat w/ my mom and Carly was there :D I missed her lots :) So...Thursday is my birthday. Can't wait! I have no idea what I'm gonna do. Can't expect much, I guess. I'm not feelin' this whole birthday thing anymore, really. I mean, by expecting, I mean...I don't expect to get anything out of being "16". Big deal is what I'm saying. It's just a number...and everybody else has already experienced it. lol...I'm all alone in that one, too. Tomorrow I'm babysitting my nephew...but...my mom is helping of course..so...woo! lol Thursday I wanna hang out w/ Carly before she leaves...hope it all works out. Cuz I'm gonna miss her while she's gone. :'( Everybody's leaving me this week. For real. I'm supposed to be leaving next weekend, but I think I'm staying. I guess something exciting is supposed to happen (RIGHT Carly! :P) But Carly will be back then  so will Megan so it's got to rock somehow. :) We've got to get our group back together: Carly, Josh, Megan, and me. :) I miss 'em all. We're kind of like...family...but not. haha It's crappy weather outside right now. Kinda. I hope it doesn't rain this week, especially on my birthday. My birthdays have always sucked, so I want this one to rock. Ugh...and I have to get a job soon...haha...Crazy. Not that I mind. Sort of. Anyhoo ~ I'm off.... *All of it* -- SiLaS
