We can choose "Dubya", who in my opinion, is an ignorant red-neck from Texas who only wants our oil under Iraq's soil, or we can choose Kerry, who by my opinion(and we all know that opinions are like ass holes), is a weak kneed liberal who only says what he says because it will get him votes.(And lets not forget, he won Three Purple Hearts. We can't forget because heharps on it! But, anyway.)   What ever happened to public office being a public service? Now it is a way for big business to control the country by putting their puppets in office. You should'nt be able to get rich by guiding the views of your constituents. Both Kerry and Bush are money grubbing, two-faced criminals who bend the system to their whims and we, the common folk, reap the so called "rewards".   We need a candidate who can speak his mind and not bow to party and big business' will. We need a leader of the caliber of F.D.R. or of Kennedy. Not the grudge holding power monger in office now. And not the botox boy who wants to lead the Democrats back into the White House.   I would just as soon elect "Hillary" than either one of these two clowns, andbelieve me, Ifuckin hate HILLARY!(Just thought I'd let you know for sure how I feel about these guys{like youcouldn't tell})   Well, I've vented my frustrations for now. Please read and post what you think.  Thank you all and have a "Nice" day.  Kamron
