Last Monday I went to a friend's house and we had a huge water fight. At the end everybody was soaked.  I went back too school last Tuesday, Spring Break is over.   We went on a field trip on Thursday to Leighton Center. It's a museum where Mr  Mrs Leighton used to live. Mr. Leighton was a famous artist. Mrs Leighton started a school for art. I made a weaving while we were there.  On Friday we started recorders I only know one note and that note is b. I can play a song called Just B.  That's all folks
