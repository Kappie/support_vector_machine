However, if my job becomes more difficult for no good reason, then I start getting pissed. The guy is a fucking idiot. I got into work today and all the furniture was rearranged. The assistant manager said that when she showed up in the morning, many of the furniture was outside. The retail shelves were moved to a place where they were blocking the windows, resulting in customers complaining about the blocked ocean view. We had 5 customers rant about it and fill out complaint forms.  The guy literally ripped up the place so that we could clean things for the corporate monthly review. He made such a mess, that if the district manager came in early for a surprise review, we would have failed miserably. Things weren't where they should be, and boxes were all over the place in the back.  He also decided to change the motherboard on one of the registers, and it fucked up the system for a good while too. As far as I know, only one register is still working even now. I don't even know why he changed the motherboard on the register, as that register was working fine. The working register is probably still spewing out receipts every few minutes as well.  It was also bad, because he gave us lots of extra crap to do, in addition to serving our customers on a busy day. He had the nerve to give me a "what the fuck are you doing" look when I was doing some of the really stupid tasks on his list. Then he wanted to make sure I was putting the beans back on the shelves in order, because he went through them last night. I was tempted to say, they're probably not in order to begin with because I was finding lots of out of place bags of beans.  What really pissed me off was that in his tearing up of the place, our stuff in the worker's locker got thrown out. I had to retrieve our stuff from the dumpster.  I came back and essentially blamed him in a harsh tone of voice. Trying to restrain myself from cursing. If I had lost my backpack full of books, I would have started cursing and walked off the job. I don't think I could work under a fucktard that'd cost me over $100 in books and other stuff. The pussy got all defensive, blaming others for his own stupidity.   ***
