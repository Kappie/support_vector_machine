Anyway, he came on MSN a short while afterwards and we were all sorted.  Sam, Kayla and James called for me and Craig met up with us on the way to Chris' house.    The idea today was for Chris to walk through town wearing womens clothes.  That plan fell through the roof faster than an elephant falling from a helicopter.  We walked into town, past the Big Issue seller (looking as scary as ever), the old war protester man sitting in his deck chair with his anti-government signs, and two Labour and Tory stands right next to each other (Labour won; they offered free helium balloons!).  We walked to the end of the road (saw Becky again emerging from the new Cafe Nero) and then tailed back up to the centre again.  Everyone had lunch in Fatdonalds.  Chris took a yellow helium balloon which was floating idly on the ceiling, which was swiftly taken off him by a nasty member of staff, stating "They're for children!".  So what was the staff member doing with it then   lmao.  Chris (the baloon taking person) then did a stand up performance in the middle of Fatdonalds upstairs, which Sam caught on film.  When we went out, Chris swiped a dark green balloon from under the staffs' noses and we ran out of the premises laughing.  Chirs, accompanied with his new friend (the Fatdonalds balloon), went round taking the wet out of the Labour balloons by going up to people and saying "Vote McDonalds!  Free Hamburger Policy!".  We walked behind St. Mary's Church and Chris did a rather loud speech about it, causing a lot of attention.  (A woman walked past asking if he had recently left St. George's!)    Town park was the next stop.  They had refilled the swimming pool (it's a little farty kids paddling pool really) and we thought about things we could do.  Sam then went home alone and everyone else stayed in town to continue the antics.  We went to Home Bargains where a roll of 5m Tin Foil was purchased and promptly wrapped around Chris' head.  Oh the laughter!  Every single person who sighted Chris either laughed, looked at him weirdly, or took a quick peek and then looked away quickly.  On entry to JJB Sports he got some very snotty, gawping, and sneering looks from the uptight people in there.    We all went to chill out in town park for a bit.  Michaela and James went into the swimming pool and we ended up scooping water with the plastic bags and winging them about.  In the end it was a brilliant day out and we went home after another cool day out together.  One of my good mates has been quite upset today and I hope to cheer her up a bit tomorrow    Before I go, I just have one little message for Fatdonalds...  !
