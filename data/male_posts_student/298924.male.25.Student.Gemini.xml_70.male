I have a serious spending problem as far as DVD's go....it's like crack....I wrote down a list of 16 movies I absolutely have to have not more than 15 minutes after counting the 85 movies I own presently....there is a problem here....  Also I saw Faith Evan's new video this morning....she looks better than she ever did....I think I am even mildly attracted to her new look....this is disturbing to me....  Anyways school looms in today's future....
