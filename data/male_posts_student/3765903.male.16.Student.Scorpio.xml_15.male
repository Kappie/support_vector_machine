Have simply existed because "he had morphine that day..." - this being a prime example of such an attempt:  urlLink Picasso   Well, looks like Dave's made a career for himselfg as an art critic... though, he may not last long when he claims, "the sky isn't that colour... haven't you seen the sky? Uh? I'm confused? Why are you shouting 'Zombie' at me Martin???".... lol...  ahhh... that was fun!!  In proper blogstyle, today's been a very hectic and boring day (yes yes, the two CAN actually go together...), completely unlike yesterday! YAY! Steph, Mrs Churms and Jono took me bowling! It was greatest fun!!! :D! Yay!!  Anyways... I must go now for the bath must be claimed for king and zombie! Have z'ye Fun Martin J.
