I Don't Know If I Will Have Time To Post A Entry Tomorrow, Because I Am Going To The Rodeo, I Get To Check Out cowgirls...Go Me! I Am Going To The Rodeo With My Cousins Then I Am I Think Staying With Them Until Monday And Then I'm Coming Home. I Swear If I Don't Get My Report Card Tomorrow... I'm Not Getting It  Ever ! I Am Really Happy I Get To Do Something, If You Can't Tell From My Entry's I Have Been Doing A lot Of Nothing For This Past Week!
