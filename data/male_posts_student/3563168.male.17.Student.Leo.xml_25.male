One fact was that if you drank more than 3 or 4 sodas a week then you were about 80% more likely to get diabetes then those of kids that don't.    In light of these recent facts that I have learend, I've come to this conclusion: I am soon going to die.    As the title implies, I do, in fact, drink a whole shit load of soda. So, I leave all of my belongings to my brother, except I donate my trumpet to Arturo Sandoval, so that he can revel in all of my glory.     Well, no, I'm just kidding because Arturo Sandoval could kick my ass with a cork in his mouth.    So, in conclusion, I won't write my will just yet due to the fact that tons of other kids drink soda and they haven't died yet. Maybe I should calm down my daily intake though....    Nah.
