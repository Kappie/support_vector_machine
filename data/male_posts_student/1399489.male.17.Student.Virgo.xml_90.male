Today went very well! school went good, football went ok, and the archie manning dinner was really good! the best thing was after when i got 2 talk 2 jes. we worked out all the stuff that had been goin on!  No arguments or anything we basically agreed on it all today!  we decided that we shouldnt be boyfriend girlfriend right now b/c espically with summer commin up that would just be do hard!  so we are dating for the time being.  that means alot more relaxed and a lot less serious.  also, just talk every few days, dont worry about having to do something all the time, more time for all my friends, and just simpler overall!  i think it will be alot better and easier!  im happy, good night!
