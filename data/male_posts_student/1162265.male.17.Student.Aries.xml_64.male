So for the next few weeks, I'm closing the big red notebook, not looking in the dictionary, and not scribbling Arabic all over my crap.  I'm gonna play it "cool" and do the Esperanto thang.  Even though not one of my loyal reads really cares about me  Atakalam Arabbiyyah Bi-Talaq  Or  Me Parlos Esperanton bone  but oh well.  School.  Nothing to say.  I tried to get all pantheistic and green and go to Gaia, but it wasn't today.  Sucha shame.  I really gotta log of though, as it's late.   Such a short entry.
