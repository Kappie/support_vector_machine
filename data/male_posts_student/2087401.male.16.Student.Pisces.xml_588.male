Eventually, I drove one to pick up Sophia, who was trappied in Sophie's body, (Sophie was one of the four yearolds from vbs) and we had to try and find a way to get her out. Meanwhile, Sophie was still in her own body, and I kept losing track of Sophia, so I had to ask Sophie to let her say things. then I woke up in another dream, that I don't remember. Then I really woke up.   Supposedly, your subconcious knows everything, but i disagree. I think you notice somethings, and your subconcious only notices the rest. thats why dreams seem to mean something some times, but they're really just random and weird.   My birthday is tomorrow!   Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
