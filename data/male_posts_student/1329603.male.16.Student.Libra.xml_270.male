Damned if I'm going to tell you (unless 'you' is Stanners, who I usually talk to about this kind of thing) what HDWF stands for, but this is possibly going to be the longest-running experiment of my lifetime, so... I'm not even sure it's going to answer anything, and any results can hardly be conclusive. At the moment, a couple of possible results seem to be shying away a tad. What have I got to lose?  NJaN practices are going well, and I'd say that currently "Blueshift" is out of the running as a bandname as a result of Tom cleverly pointing out that some "witty" people might call us "Bluesh*t" (I don't usually censor my blog, but in this case, I want people to be able to read that at school without feeling like I've gone off on a tangent). So at the present moment I'd say it was between these;     Aten   Not Just a Number (still in there but I don't see it being in there for much longer,  for possible legal reasons)   Nuts and Bolts    Perhaps I've missed a couple, and if so, Tom'll be sure to post the ones I've forgotten. I've had a couple of ideas but in retrospect they're pretty poor so I'm not really going to submit them. I think from now on, we have to really nit-pick at our own pieces so we can make the EP as good as possible. We've really got to do an over-perfectionist tutor job here.  Oh, and in other news, the solo with CYB went well (not as well as I'd hoped, but still well), as did the trombone quartet, and Susie came to watch which was lovely. I don't usually have anyone to talk to. Spotted Sam in amongst the crowd... which was odd, 2ce in 2 days. Must be my lucky weekend. As can be expected, I've burned quite badly on my forearms (despite wearing a long-sleeved shirt), hands, and face, despite putting on whole globules of sun block. Hoorah. My record of never going out in the sun for anything more than 20 minutes without burning is intact.  Quote of the day: "Imagine no posessions. I wonder if you can? No need for greed, Or for hunger, The brotherhood of man."  From John Lennon's   Imagine   Love, Jon Roskilly
