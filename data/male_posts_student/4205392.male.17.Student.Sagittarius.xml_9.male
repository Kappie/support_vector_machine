Although it makes me feel warm and bubbly to understand how Marvin the Paranoid Android of Hitchhiker fame feels, ("Here I am, brain the size of a planet..."), it's more than annoying that I was lured here under false pretenses of learning how to sysadmin and network, only to click points on a map indicating where gas stations are in Palos Verdes. Furthermore, what I do is clearly labeled out in a far more efficient manner on Yahoo Maps, and the data I am inputting will very likely be used by less than a hundred people. So here's my ultimatum to you, PV on the Net. Give me a decent computer and a decent task, and I'll join your forces with the utmost loyalty. Otherwise, be prepared to spend hours trying to guess a password after I am safely several hundred miles away. [/rant]
