DDD: Schedule: 1. French 1 2. Biology 3. Geography Honors 4. World Civilizations 5. Honors Art 6. English 9 Honors 7. Algebra 2  Blah, I can't believe I'm taking every honors/"advanced" class available for my grade (9). >. I really hope this school year will be better than the last. I got into a ton of trouble this past school year, and I hope my record doesn't carry over to the new school. I'm kind of annoyed because I have Geo Honors and World Civs with a really annoying Star Wars fan who loves to argue with teachers over stupid topics. It would've been nice if 9th graders could take US History, since my expertise includes The Civil War, but World Civs and Geo Honors will be fun too, I suppose. Yeah, yeah, enough of my ranting over school subjects. I'll just end this now, since I seem to have nothing else to write. Ta.
