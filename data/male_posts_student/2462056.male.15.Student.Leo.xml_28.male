Whenever my dad's side of the family gets together, we always have fun.  It mainly consisted of pool time, and a VERY competitive badmitten tournament, haha it was really awesome.  Claire's gone in NY, I got to talk to her last night, and she is having a great time, which was awesome.  Still haven't seen anyone since I've gotten back.  So yeah, I got to test my mp3 player "in the field" a.k.a. on a road trip, and it is really awesome, so I'm glad I got it.  I wrote a new song today, along with a bass part that sounds pretty good with it.  Too bad I can't play guitar, or I might actually have a full song:   I Saw this in a dream A dream that never ended I just wanted to wake up (wake up) Walk with toes in the sand Wake up, Wake up Kiss your face once again Wake up Wake up Pinch me if I'm dreaming I never wanted this to end  Just last week we were having a blast Hanging out with friends, not moving to fast Had all the time in the world, and places to go There's one last thing that I want you to know  I just wanted to wake up (wake up) Walk with toes in the sand Wake up, Wake up Kiss your face once again Wake up Wake up Pinch me if I'm dreaming I never wanted this to end  It wasn't your fault It's a misunderstanding I wasn't prepared For this crash landing  I just wanted to wake up (wake up) Walk with toes in the sand Wake up, Wake up Kiss your face once again Wake up Wake up Pinch me if I'm dreaming I never wanted this to end   So yep, not sure if I'll add another verse or not, I think I kinda like it being short though.  So yeah, the next few weeks are going to consist of near constant music/bass playing, and summer work.  I'm reading I, Robot, and it is really really good.  My goal is to finish the book and the writing by this Friday.  Then I have to get started on my American History stuff.  So yeah... the rest of this summer will be great fun...
