The group that most closely follows these charateristics, is the "in crowd".  The people that dont meet their standards of "cool" are outcast and labeled; Goths, Geeks, Nerds, Stoners, and more... but then on top of that, the out casts groups dont like each other either, everyone hates everyone who isnt the same group as them.  They all have names for eachother, and reasons, and excuses, but what they dont have, and dont seem to want is sympathy.  People are every day being insulted and bashed for reasons that they dont really have control over, because they didnt make to sports team they aren't "jocks" and thus are a "looser".  Because they want to make somthing out of there lives and not do poorly  in school, they cant be "in" and are a "nerd".  But what is worse, in my opinion at least, is if they try to chage the person that they are, so that they can fit in with the people who they wan to be.  Because they know so much about computers and stuff, they become "geeks".  But if they try to change them selves, then that is changeing who they are, and doing that will enevitably make them regret who they were, and quite possibly hate themsleves.  There is a term for that addapted by the "goth" and other groups that i feel applies quite well for thoes kinds of people, "conformist". If anyone can offer me some insite in the depths of reason behind this kind of thing, would they plz help me to understand.   oh, and one more thing, can someone explain to me why people think im gay?  apperently its a widely held opinion.. at least among the fucks at my school.  or at least it according to my ex-girlfriend, but shes an idiot, so it doesnt matter that much i guess... night then
