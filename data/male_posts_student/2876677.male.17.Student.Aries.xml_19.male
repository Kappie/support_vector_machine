I like answering questions with a question.  I like being answered with a question.  Its fun.  I like getting out a three-hundred pound concordance and searching for verses.  It is definitely much easier to open up a Bible program and have all the references pop up on my screen for almost any given topic, but it just isnt the same.  Books are just fun.  Not to get off the subject too much (although it is my blog so I can do what I want...), my library is driving me insane.  If a person from 200 years ago were to go to a present day library I think they would be appalled.  25 rows of DVDs compared to 10 rows of books.  This is very irritating.  Libraries today are filled with the likes of  Scary Movie , brand new computers with flat panel monitors, and  Seventeen  magazine.  All this worthless depravity and no Paul Bunyan or Soren Kirkegaard.  I will find you hard-pressed to find any book that does not have pictures, or a liberal slant, or a book written over 20 years ago or one about God from anytime.  However Harry Potter is always in stock.  Why they even have curtains around some computers for "personal viewing".  How wonderful.  Where is the education in a place supposed to house our knowledge?  We as a people are going downhill.  People can't read a two page paper but they can sit through Return of the King.  No one knows how to use their imaginations these days...  I hate it.  My kids are being read CS Lewis to bed and are listening to Bach.  People are just dumb.  I have been dumbed down to some extent.  You definitely have...
