That was alright though, I was feeling pretty tired when I got home from class anyways. I did however get a taste of the racing today during class when they taught us how the course would work and had us run through a few practice races. I feel like being creative, so here's a diagram showing the course:        Just realized I forgot to draw the wind on that diagram, and I dont want to put a new one on. So yeah--the wind is coming from the top. So you start at the line, and tack upwind. Then, you have to round the windward marker, without touching it, and head for the jive mark. After you jive around that, you head for the leeward marker, and then start tacking upwind again to get back to the starting line. Sometimes you race two laps, with the finish line restricted. That means that if you pass through the starting line when starting your second lap you're disqualified. "oops!" Luckily that wasn't me. But anyways, racing was pretty fun--we raced three times, I ranked 2nd, 1st, and 2nd out of about 12 people in my group--level two. Tomorrow I should be moving up a bit though, so I'm looking forward to that.     That was about it for sailing class today. We ate lunch at the park again, and one of the laser students covered the slide with sun screen and got little kids to ride it down. Pretty much uneventfull other than that.
