At the end, for two frames, the  www.xbox.com  URL under the Xbox logo changes to  www.ilovebees.com . Now if you go to that site, it appears to be hacked. Looking deeper, you will find odd detail. Among these are the META keywords and cryptic messages scattered throughout the domain. It has been noted that the countdown on the front page is to August 24th 2004. This date is 77 days before Halo 2's release (Bungie has an odd fascination with the number seven, I've read). Some odd phrases can be found in the hex for several of the site's images as well.
