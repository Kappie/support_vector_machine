They're playing all the best British bands (and others), and its great. Bands like...(and I know all of these)  Snow Patrol U2 The Cure The Verve Franz Ferdinand (deep cuts like Matinee too!!) The Strokes Red Hot Chili Peppers Scissor Sisters The Rolling Stones Dido Eagle-Eye Cherry Keane Talking Heads Crowded House Morrissey   Plus the British accents and mentionings of Wimbledon are cool. Even the downtown England traffic report is fun-there's a highway there named Southbound M3. Yet another reason to move to England...  Britain simply does radio better. And I need to buy about 5 albums.
