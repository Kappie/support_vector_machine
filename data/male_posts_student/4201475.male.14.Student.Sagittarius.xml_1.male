As i lie on the floor nearly unconcious he ran down the stairs grabbed a funnel from the cupboard and placed it in my mouth then he got the orange juice out of the fridge and held my nose while pouring the orange juice down the funnel!....for someone watching it it would have been really funny. i coughed it up all over the floor and he stole my pen from my pocket and ran back up the stairs. when i got off the floor i went up stairs to get my pen back and he through the over shoe at me so i ran back to the kitchen got a lemon and as he was peering over the side rail of the stairs i piffed the lemon and it hit him Cleen between the eyes and exploded on his head.  when i got home i realised that not only had he pick pocketed my pen but he had stolen my wallet!
