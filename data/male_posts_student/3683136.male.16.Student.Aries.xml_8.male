Went to Louis's house, and that's when things started to get interesting.  Upon arrival, Louis said something about ice cream.  mMm... ice cream.  Ate some of that.  And then, I engaged in a wonderful 5th grade, Tim Smithe-esque activity.  I played pokemon cards.  If this is something you haven't done, I'd highly reccomend it.  Very little skill required.  Basically none at all.  just luck of the draw and luck of the coin.  After several hours of that, James and Louis went to sleep.  And Julian and I went to work.  We took a wonderful little felt tipped marker, and wrote all over Louis's bathroom (don't worry, it came off.)  It was crazy fun.  Woke up this morning.  Tired as shit, but happy.  It's a start.  -Mike  "Drivin' on the lawn, sleeping on the roof, drinkin' all the alcohol. All the kids from school, will be naked in the pool, while our parents are on, Fire Island."
