I have a very good Christmas. I got a lot of good stuff. Here is a short list:  Pirates of the Caribbean DVD 505 Stupid Websites (this book is really funny) a Civil War book candy a Sponge Bob Square Pants pillow (which I left in my locker at school). Sorry Stef!   But yea. How was your Christmas/Hanukkah/other? Good? Bad? I hope everyone has a good New Year!
