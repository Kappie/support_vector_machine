" Fear factor, Bullshit factor, Fat factor, Ugly factor, Obnoxious factor... they're all the same to me... i dunno whats coming next and i dont really care either" . Lmfao. He basically just took fear factor and put a bunch of random adjectives in it and pretended they were actual shows.. On another note, Funniest Home Videos is actually hilarious as HELL. I almost choked to death when two little kids dressed in super hero costumes tried to wake up theyre dad , who was sleeping in a towel for some reason by singing and dancing by his bed. All of a sudden you hear the mother "GET EM BOYSSS" next thing u know this little GIRL nails the dad right in the balls lmfao that killed me. Other funny videos included a small girl trying to swim to shore while a deranged goose pecked her head in an angry fashion. Or some oldie getting pushed into a lake by a goat, or some 40 year old dyke that fell down a water fall.  My dad ; 1  Bullshit Factor ; 0 Funniest Home Videos; 10
