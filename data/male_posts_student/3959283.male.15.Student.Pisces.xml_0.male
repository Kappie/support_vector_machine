Every once in a while there is a problem in their "perfect" reality.    They make a joke out of this problem, and it is soon resolved and everything goes back to normal.    Many people think that life should be like that, when there is no way in hell that it will ever happen that way.    If people want to live like that…you’re a dreamer.    Nothing can be perfect.    People like to think that their life “sucks” or they are terribly depressed because of things not going their way.    The reason people think their life sucks is because they suck.    They don’t know how to look at what they have and see what’s good about it, especially the upper middle class people.    They have a lot of money and a lot of things.    They have so many things and yet some will be depressed.    They get upset because of one little thing that they probably never cared about in the first place.    I was once like this too once.    When I was like 4 my great aunt gave me a quarter to get a gumball.    I was so excited (come on I was four) and I was really hoping not to get the white gumball.    Unfortunately I got the white gumball.    I was so pissed off; I think I even started to cry.    I pouted and I pouted, but yet I just stuck the gumball in my pocket.    I was still pissed as hell but we went over to the park.    There was some sort of festival going on at the time so there were a lot of people at the park.    So I waited and I waited to get a swing, and I finally got one, and while I was swinging the stupid white gumball that I didn’t even want feel out of my pocket.    Some older kids decided it would be fun to take my gumball.    Two older kids came over and started to basically play keep away with the gumball.    They had me diving in the sand and everything getting horribly dirty just for a gumball I didn’t even want.    I even started to cry.    I started to call for my Mom but when I turned around the two jerks ran off.    I started chasing after those kids as fast as my little legs would go.    I didn’t find them, and I began to cry.    I cried over a gumball I didn’t want.    I think about this and I think to myself, “What the fuck was wrong with you Mike”.    I didn’t even need the gumball.    I should have cared less if they stole that gumball, I didn’t want it so who gives a damn.    Well I did.    I wanted candy, but if it was white I was going to be upset.    It’s just like someone getting their first car.    They want a car so bad, but when they see that the only car they can get is some junked car that all its good for is going from point A to point B…they don’t want it.    They want a car but they don’t want this one because it doesn’t look good.    The car runs fine, but it looks like shit.    I say to people, “you wanted a car right?    And this is all you can get?    Then take the goddamn thing you bastard.    I mean it’s not like your first car is gonna be a Ferrari”.    I can’t even drive yet and I really want a Mini Cooper.    Well I’m pretty sure I’m not gonna get it, I’m pretty sure I wont get a car at all.    If I do…It’s gonna    be something given to me that’s a million years old.    I wont care…I’ll have a car.    So any way I was saying that people need to see the good side of things.    I wanted a gumball, but since it was white I didn’t eat it.    I should have just shrugged my shoulders and ate it.    You can’t even tell the color once you put it in your mouth.
