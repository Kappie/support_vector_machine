I woke up - in more ways than one - and realized that I'm a godawful friend. I cause far more problems than I create, and not just with her. I woked up to the sound of fate.  How long has it been since we talked like we used to? How long has it been since I gave her advice? How long has it been since we talked about more than just hello and goodbye? How long has it been since I've been making her life miserable? How long has it been since I've been making his life miserable?  are just a few that come to mind.  All too long. She doesn't even come to me for help anymore, hell,  I  wouldn't come to me for help. She has better places to look.  Seeing how much of a great friend he is brings a tear to my eye. Seeing how good of a friend he is makes me realize how bad of a friend I am. He's so great. Me? I am a burden on her, nothing more.  February, what would now be more than a year ago, was when we first truly met. I remember that night, she said how anxious she would get when left alone. At that moment, I knew I had to help her, above all else. If I could have, I would have never left that house so that she wouldn't have to feel alone. My goal in life from that point on was to always care for her, always be there, always make her happy. I failed, I failed, I failed.  I woke up to the knocking of fate, did you know that? He sent me a letter, and in it was the truth. I know this because truth is easily distinguishable from lie; for someone like me, the truth is often harder to believe. He made a mistake any one of us would have made. Why persecute him? His intentions are geniune.  Tears of mine are bridled with sick laughter.   A beast of burden I have become, Upon your small shoulders, A beast of burden. I have lost.   If I end up with her in the end, will that help? I will simply have guilted her into it.  FUCK!
