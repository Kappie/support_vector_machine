We went out to the local resturant called, The Clock.  It's one of my favorite places to eat.  You can get mostly anything you would want to eat in the morning.  ;)  After that we came home and showered and played some video games. (lol)  What else do you do on a Saturday, right?!  After that we decied to go see a movie (Harry Potter).  It started at 5:00pm, so we didn't get out of the movies till about 8:300pm.  Anyways, I want to post some pics ...  hope you enjoy them!    This is the way the aptartment looks right now ...  (10:25pm)    My Girl Friend, Maria ...  She's Fuckin Awesome!  Welp, I chat with ya tommarow ...  buh bye
