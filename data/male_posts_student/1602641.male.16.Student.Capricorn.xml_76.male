I was nervous the whole time there that I was going to, in typical Larry David fashion, do something wildly innappropriate, like start singing the Soviet national anthem the moment the casket went past. Fortunately, I was able to conform to the solemnity of the occasion and appreciate it for the historic, momentous event that it was. Yet there was a strange, almost parade-like atmosphere hanging in the air - merchants were hocking Reagan death memorobilia everywhere, jets flew in formation and made big loud noises, the military color guard played patriotic tunes... it was just all very celebretory. While ethically I am strongly opposed to this, I must say I felt quite tempted to get one of those "In Loving Memory" t-shirts. I'm not sure why. I also noticed something strange - this was without a doubt the largest concentration of white people in one place at one time that I have ever seen in DC. It was like a Dukes of Hazard convention.  At present, I'm listening to an old Ronald Reagan movie being played by TCM on one TV and  Air Force One  being played on another. Terrific. Just terrific.  Oh, and congratulations are in order - TO ME! 'CAUSE I'M A SENIOR NOW!!! WOOWOO!!! YEEEEEAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!!! Who be da senior? Forrest be da senior! That's right, that's right, let it work little brotha, let it work! Hey, Andy: Who be da senior?    Who be da senior???
