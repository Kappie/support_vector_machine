Well, ok, sometimes it's good to be organized, but not with music. I mean, how do you objectify the subjective without being overly general and taking away from the uniqueness of the music? I'm sure that there are several people out there that typically listen to lighter stuff that would love the song Nothing Else Matters, but haven't ever been exposed to it because Metallica is labeled as a "rock" or "metal" group. If we didn't pre-occupy ourselves with what kind of music a band played, and listened to the band, we'd have a much higher tolerance for different types of music, and have much better exposure to different styles of music. Now granted, I'm a huge music buff, but I think this idea is pretty universal.
