Since it would be pretty dorky for me to e-mail my friends and offer them gmail accounts, instead I'm offering them to you.  So, e-mail me if you want one.  Preference to someone who can provide a connection (or advice) to help me someday get my words printed in a publication of some sort.  :)  But even if you can't, I'd say it's worth a try to e-mail me if you want the invite.
