I liked it, I miss the feeling of everyone's eyes burning into me, questioning my worth, judging me for my outward apperance. Tonight, I just wanted to scream "Fuck the army, war exists only as an ego booster for a select few generals who measure their self worth on the amount of innocent lives lost under their watch". I wanted to tell them, I wanted to disagree. I don't know how anymore.  urlLink  postCount('dec1902');
