I want to talk about unsung songs right now though....songs that are buried somewhere on someone's soundtrack, played late at night on the quiet storm, or just a good song stuck on a bad album....alot of the songs on my 3000 strong MP3 list are like this....  So I'm listening to Jill Scott "Dreamin"....this song was on the In Too Deep soundtrack....it's basically a version of beautiful dreamer....very nice and mellow....good Sunday morning music....  Norman Conners "Valentine Love" is another....it's basically a duet between some unknown male and female....it sounds very similar to "Golden Time of Day" by Frankie Beverly and Maze....he is also behind the "You Are My Starship" song...  O' Brien did probably the best cover of any Stevie Wonder song ever in his version of "You and I"....he made changes in the song that made it his own....yet it retained the essence of the song....as opposed to the just as good yet more "coverish" "Ribbon in the Sky" by Intro....  In the category of "I shouldn't like this terrible song but I do" is "Straight F*cking" by Gator and the Transitions on the Baby Boy Soundtrack (actually that whole soundtrack is pretty great!)....it's the song playing when Jody goes to visit Pandora....it might just be me showing my quirks....but I kinda dig that song....  Kilo Ali's "Love in Ya Mouth" was a hit in Atlanta....and with an appearance by Big Boi it qualifies as a highly slept on song for Outkast fans looking for a good verse from the dynamic duo....  Ghostface Killa's favorite band from his youth must be Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band with his reworkings of Cher Chez La Femme (Cher Chez Le Ghost) and Sunshowers (Ghost Showers)....Sunshowers was the song that haunted me for so long as "that song playing in Rickey and Doughboy's house when young Trey comes to visit them"....you know the scene where Tyra Ferrell is telling young Doughboy that he wasn't sh!t and would never be sh!t....  Well it's time to throw some food together....
