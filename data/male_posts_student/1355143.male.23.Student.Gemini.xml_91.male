Rooney is an excellent player but Pele is unique.  "There will never be another Pele, not in 1,000 years, even in a computer game."  I love the part about not even in a computer game. Apparently that was a necessary addition, because I was definitely thinking to myself "Well, what about in a computer game?"   A, hope you enjoy the last few nights in Barcelona. Say hello to all the old haunts. Don't forget to enjoy every sight and sound...the horns honking constantly, the motos whining uphill, the announcements on the Metro. Give em your best "Adeu." Hope you've got something to cheer about tomorrow night. Those Iberians all need a dose of reality.  Cheers, Tim
