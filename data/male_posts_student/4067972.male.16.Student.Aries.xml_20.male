The carpet was supposed to be installed by tomorrow or friday, but they called and said otherwise.  My mom was so mad and talked the lowe's guy into having our carpet installed on tuesday.  Come to find out, our paperwork just sat somewhere for a week and it was found today or yesterday or something.  So after tuesday, you won't have to hear me rambling on and on about the carpet, cement floor, tackstrip; i'll have to find something else to ramble about.  It'll be nice not to have to eat around a patio table that's about 2 feet in diameter.  Whelp, gottago.
