For a few dayz i delt with the break-up pretty badly, i was jus sad and stuff and i jus couldn't stop thinking about her. But vball has really helped a lot lately, what use to b something that i dreaded doin in the early part of the summer, now is helping me cope with my breakup and makin me happy. Like i have a good chance of bein accepted to play at the University of Hawaii cuz i'm goin make a recruitment tape for alfred so that he could give to his coach. And my playing has improved, especially my hitting...Beach has helped me a lot with that. So the time that i usual spend, bein sad, is now spend getting better at vball so that i can achieve my dreams...it suckz that things between me and steph had to b this way, she is a great person and i guess we jus didn't know each other that well to go out in the first place, so i'm not totally bummed really, jus a tad bit. But im glad that vball is goin so well, hopefully i will play my best tomorrow so that when the coach from Hawaii sees it, then he will b impressed. I hope that God is with me tomorrow, that would b a big help.  I guess bein single is not too bad...so i'll leave with that...payce.
