One of those days that I'd rather spend in the shade, or inside. And yet, I went on a walk earlier. The sun is an absolute nuisance, sometimes. It makes me sweat, which then makes me realize that I stink. It even burns me if I'm in it too long. It's a relief when night falls, really; that is, until you realize the sun isn't so bad. Sure, its heat is uncomfortable on days like this, but at least you can see what you're doing. And you can see other things for what they are rather than guessing at vague shapes and shadows. I don't like electric light at all. I used to, but I've since changed my mind. It's so fake. It just doesn't feel right once you learn to appreciate the sun.
