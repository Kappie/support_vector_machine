This doesn't make them stupid or unworthy of life.  There are appropriate cases where protection is needed.  They lack the ability to understand the consequences of thier actions.    Adults are a different story.  I don't favor protecting an adult from thier own stupidity in any situation.  As for the value of children over adults, Mike can defend himself.  I invite replies.
