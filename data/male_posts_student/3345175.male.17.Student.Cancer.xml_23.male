As an arguement with mother escalated earlier in the car, i suddenly burst into tears with no clue why. And it has been discovered - all the times ive been near crying or thought i could cry, i actually havent done, and now its all built up. Five years of hormones let go in one, and i could probably still go if i have to listen to "All By Myself" one more time today.  Anywayz, as if that wasnt enough i came on here this afternoon to find an angry Nicola Corrigan having a go at me for stuff i said to David last nite. Following the dumping i handled it as i do everything - i put on a brave front and make innocent jokes, in this case to also show no hard feelings and all that. So i was like "och ye were a crap kisser anyway" and all that. And i was taken seriously, despite telling David i was only kidding. Jesus people i know mine isnt the best but a sense of humour would be nice to come across. Why does everyone take everything so seriously?  Yes so im angry, because people who knew me better than David believed i could be that intentionally hurtful, which is just insulting. Also - YAY! Im being blamed for it!  He spent basically ten minutes telling me he didnt wanna be in the relationship anymore. Come on, would u expect me to wanna be in a relationship where the other person didnt wanna be in it for much longer? I didnt wanna cause any more confusion or panic attacks for him, and i didnt wanna have to be in a relationship in that he didnt wanna be in! So i said "if you dont do it, i will". AND GUESS WHAT?! EVERYONE (and i mean everyone) that he spoke to last nite was told that i gave him an ultimatum. Which means that Aaron, Nicola, Sarah, Jason and possibly even Jude now thinks that i wanted him to break up with me, and that i forced him into it.  I FUCKING WOULDNT!!!!  I've liked the guy for over a year, and as far as i was concerned things were going good till tuesday. The fact he wasnt happy hit me like a ton of fucking steel-coated bricks, and people actually believe i would FORCE him to dump me?!  I've decided...consciously...i hate you all!
