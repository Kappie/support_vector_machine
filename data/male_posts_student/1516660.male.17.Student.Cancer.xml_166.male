She told me, "Kelvin Yip! No chance for you! You lost your chance already. Your choir teachers talked to me. So, you can't get excellent. Never mind la. Very good is good already!" When she told me this, three thoughts came to my mind. First, when she said "No chance for you", I was like thinking "What? What? What did I do?". then she said "Your choir teachers talked to me", I was like "Oh my! Did they tell Chew what i said in my testimonial is wrong?" Then she said "A very good is good already", I knew it was my conduct grade lor. Oh well. I was kinda dissappointed for a while, and went on blaming the choir teachers. But then i realized something. Mrs Chew worked hard to get me an excellent grade. I should be very grateful and thankful to her. And being nominated for excellent is a reconginition. I am very happy liao lor. At least I am being nominated and Mrs Chew is trying to get me get excellent. Yeah! :)  After that, there is this photo-taking thingy for the whole class. Two major events happened. One is the omission of "Kelvin" in my name! Now, that is an insult, to me, to my memory and to my exsistence. I hastened to write my real name down there. But! However! I was stopped by Janet and Shuet Ling (with a few glares and threatens). I didn't get to write my name down. I got damned pissed off. The more I think about it, the more angry I got. They told me to tell the person in charge. I don't want to bother him. What if he glares at me? What if he dismiss me off? Then I will get nothing accomplished. Besides, I got too used to the inefficient administration regarding my name (the only time when it was effective was when Mrs Chua and Mrs Chew helped me to put "kelvin" there in my name for O Level. Thank you, both of you!). I rather do it myself. So, I asked Mrs Chew, who was standing nearby, for a pen. She knew right away I wanted to add "Kelvin". HaHa! And Arman also made changes to his name (or rather. his father's). After I wrote my name, I felt immensely statisfied with myself. For adding Kelvin there, and for "defying Janet's and SL's wishes". Woah! I felt so shuang and happy. The other major event is that during the informal shoot, I rushed down in front of Mrs Chew's and kneeled there. The class was like shouting for KY to go down there in front of Mrs Chew and I thought it sounded like fun! So I rushed down there. And the 4/4 ppl watching applauded and whistled. HaHa! Crazy! I ordered both photos (formal and informal).   Another major event is the history mock exam. That exam took us by surprise! None of our predicted topics came up. Ah Ji and me were like studying the fall of communism topic, but it didn't come up. Neither did Germany. It was a "worst-case scenario" paper. And Jalil said it's a possibility. Ahh! I did the source-based first. It was quite easy la. The topic was the fall of ciommunism. That chapter we studied upon. At least I had lots of background info. For the SEQ, i did the topic on "World War 2 in the Pacific". HaHa! That was quite easy. I studied that yesterday, using the notes and worksheets ( a pathetic few....). Actually, it was only the marking scheme for Mid-Year paper 2003. Mrs Jalil was quite right after all. Study her marking scheme only. Ha! I think I can do well. Definitely above 30. Yeah.   Today is Sabrina's last episode. And in my opinion, it was simply the best! Sabrina was supposedly to be marrying Aaron tofay. She got cold feet, and have a lot of doubts in her. Whether Aaron is her soulmate or not. Their soulstones don't match. Really. While she was making her vows, she said, "I, Sabrina Spellman, agree to marry Aaron, my.....my...my..." She can't say the word "soulmate" out. Both of them had a talk. They agreed to cancel off the wedding, because Sab isn't gonna be happy. She ran out of the church, and met Harvey. Harvey was waiting for her, to get some answers on his soulstone. She ran towards him, and both of them kissed. Their soulstones fell out, and it was a perfect match. Sabrin and Harvey. Everyone came out, and appluaded them. Sabrina went away with Harvey in his bike. This is such a perfect ending (therefore, we doubt there would be further episodes of Sabrina). I always wanted to see Harvey and Sabrina together. This is so sweet, so romantic, and so right! You know, Sabrina has taught me a lot of life lessons. A lot lor. I am really attrached to Sabrina. I will really miss Sab. I really will!    We brought Arman's prezzie today. What a cute jigsaw! I can't wait to assemble it!  And oh yes. I am going to Wendy's tomorrow to teach her A-Maths. I hope I make a good tutor. And I hope she understands. Yeah. That's the most important. Yeah. I am tired now. I gotta go le.....see ya tomrrow, blog! Goodnight!
