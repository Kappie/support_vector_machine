I couldn't accept this ending. It was ordinary and ill-fitting. There had to be another way I desperately told myself and her, but she wouldn't listen. And because she wouldn't listen to my say in a matter which concerned the both of us, I'm the one who always wanted MY WAY.  I smashed a shaver when I arrived home and sat in the corner of the kitchen. It hurts but you just do it over and  over again. They say it takes your internal pain away, but it doesn't. It just adds to it on the whole. I went more than half way. Almost deep enough where when you broke the barrier, there was no turning back. But I didn't have the strength to finish it.  I had to start my homework, but I was faint and slept on the unevenly red polka dotted tiles. The cold was warm. Familiar. I went for the concert and told myself that if I didn't see one choir which blew me away, I'd return to the kitchen floor and finish what I started.  God has his ways of accommodating our insolence. There was the   urlLink novo concertante manila  . I cried when I heard them. Their music was true and humble. I have performed for slightly over a decade now, and alot of what I've seen and heard pales in comparison to this. I'm not in awe of their technique- which was flawless by the way. It's just that it was almost divine. I have no words to describe their ministry. All the rest of the choirs after them were so disheartened, they all gave up. I will be eternally grateful to novo concertante manila for saving me. I walked out of the concert hall and saw them selling their CD and T-shirts. I wanted to buy the CD but I was short of $5 coz I only had $20. Being so grateful, I told them of my intentions and how they turned the tide. I walked away a solemn yet peaceful man. One of the novo girls rushed to grab me by the hand and pulled me back. They gave me the CD and their gratitude for $20 because they were so touched by my tale.  Tonight, their song was God's mercy and gift to me. Thank you.  I thought a lot today. I have had 2 new revelations. I broke up with Zel to secure release from the pain of not being able to spend time with her. That plan back-fired and it just hurt me more. Things have a funny way of going wrong when they can huh Murphy? Secondly, Seng told me today that I can't let go, coz there is no reason to. He is right. There isn't. I'm not sure what I feel now. It's mostly a void. I'm not sure I want to fall in love again. It always hurts too much when you do.  I asked the monkeys today what life meant to them. They described it as a very big concert hall in which your perfect chords loose their rightful value, yet your errors are accentuated by worldly equalization. It's true.   There was a young monk who built a wall of a hundred bricks. Each placement was fastidiously set and the wall was 99% perfect. There was one brick however which was ajar because he had elbowed it accidentally and hadn't noticed. This brick was in the centre of the wall and the young monk was very sorrowful when he noticed it. Two wise old monks walked past the wall one day whilst the young monk sat beside the wall moping. They marveled at the wall with great awe and praised the young monk. The young monk was puzzled and said that there was still a bad brick in the wall. The wise monks told him that they were not concerned with the bad brick but were in wonder of the 99 good ones. Why cant the world be like that?  Life to me cannot be described in a sentence. Right now, the most profound thing I could think of saying, is that life can be defined with three letters. Just one word. "His". Think about it.  I will try to pre-occupy myself with music. I think that's what I was born to do. Nobody in my family was ever  into  it, yet since I could walk, I tottered up to the tele to wave my arms about; conducting the music. I'm not a prodigy and I'm not remotely good, but I will be. And when I am, WATCH YOU OUT!  In the mean time, I don't know why I'm sitting here with a bleeding arm. again, again, and AGAIN! Till I bear it no more. I will take pictures of this new streak art and post it.   "M'chism" I'll call it. A new lease on life. Do you want to turn back time?
