It's like the cream of the nerds,  so the standards are like ten times higher than average.  It's Monday. I am screaming. I need to study English, Maths, Geography, Science... five bloody subjects (and yes I KNOW I said "five" where there were "four" subjects, now I know why I failed maths... actually, I WAS right, I have a history exam as well. Shit.)   So I am knee deep in study... I hope I can get some time to blog, but the prospect is bleak.  Screamingly yours,  Colin
