After I got up I had some oatmeal and noodles because I love noodles, mainly because they're noodily delicious. Then after I ate I biked down to BJ's house and when I got there he was playing an   ILLEGAL   version of Vice City, tsk tsk, but it was kind of funny how there were a lot of really bad drivers in that game. During the game, BJ had to race a bunch of people on motorcycles and BJ was losing until all of the other racers crashed and then BJ just passed them and won the race.  Eventually Wes showed up and he brought along Bret; so after a couple minutes we all headed down to the college and waited for the bus. It took a long time for the bus to get there.... and when it did arrive Ashley and Stephany were apparently riding the same bus for a couple hours.  I DON'T LIKE ASHLEY . When we got off the bus we were at the mall and we walked down to Future Shop where I bought meself a new anime DVD and it came in a box which is all fancy and special is currently sitting on my desk beside my monitor. Wes bought a DVD of Space Balls, which is a pretty good movie because of how stupid some things are. Wes also bought  THREE  new games... and apparently he got two new ones yesterday... so......... holy crap Wes...  We were going to go watch a movie, but apparently............. we didn't...........  When I got home I had some good ol' chef boyardee, lol. Then me, Wes, BJ, and Bret were supposed to play Warcraft 3 together, but Wes was being kind of stupid, so he didn't play with us. And basicly we just played that till about 10:30.  I watched two episodes of S-cry-ed and ummm... yeah... I guess that's about it for today.            o yeah and.....  ASHLEY IS LOUD AND ANNOYING!
