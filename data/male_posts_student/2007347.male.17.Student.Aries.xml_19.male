I never had much in the way of consoles, only a good old Sega master system (not mega drive mind you). but it was good, i loved shareware, i dont know where i got those games from, friends, or something, cause no internet to download, but i loved games like Wolf3d. Cosmos, duke nukem 1  2. and the other arcades. my training in this games allowed me to become competent in most other games, i became a champion in all arcade games, i could just pick it up. i was able to astond people with my knowledge and utilization of Dos. Dos was a true operating system, you had to first be literate to be able to use it limiting computer usage to over 7. so the younger kids acutally when outside and played. not like now you fat ass youths. I soon expanded my gamming exprience. to other games, Mortal kombat, street fighter, Mario all of them. I was good, but not THAT good, some older fellas (14 up) had managed to work out the games systematically, so games like MK  street fighter were out of my league. Enter the button mashing. Ladies let me tell you now Guys who are gammers are always gammers, either they never game or always game; theres no middle ground. guys love to game, it excited everything that is masuculine in a person. Games are a Spacial activity with a sort of ego boosting satisfaction, theres that risky challenge, that danger factor.  And guys love it, cause thats what guys are good at and insinctively like to do; spacial activities, with an ego statisfaction. Sure you can dampen insincts. But, dont be mean. I am a gammer through and through not the best, not the better but a gammer, and im proud i wasted all those hours trying to top my own high score, just because.
