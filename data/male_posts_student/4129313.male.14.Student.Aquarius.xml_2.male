First period was realy dumb, nothing much hapened. One of the juniors was doing chinups from the portable's ceiling, the teacher didn't realy care much though, she was counting how many he could do. He stoped at 46.  As you probably guessed, I read my book all through second period. I'm gonna have to do a book report on 2 books in a few days. I hope I can find something on the internet or something, book reports completely ruin books.  Third period was math as usual, but this time he had us copy down 20 problems off the board, and work them out for homework.  Fourth period I have to memorize the third stanza of the poem I posted earlyer.   And both that morning equaly lay In leaves no step has trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.   Fifth period we had to run the perimiter of the first fence. I was able to do that without stoping to catch my breath this time for some odd reason, I guess I am getting better or something. After that we went into the gym to play BBall and stuff, I just stood in some places trying to make it look like I was participating. I REALY don't like sports.  I had another salad at lunch today, very delicious. They had the actual dinner rolls again, not the corn bread stuff in platic shaped like a roll. I was able to sneak away with 2 milks this time, I'm glad too, just one of those things is just never enough  Sixth period I have a test tomorow, I'm not gonna study, as long as I can spell deutschlehrer(in), then I'm good.  Yet again my front tire was flat coming home, again with the 7/11. My friend didn't come over today, he'll probably make it tomorrow or something.  I still have no ad's at the top today, so that's a good thing. I realy didn't want to spend 10 minuts to clean up the mess.
