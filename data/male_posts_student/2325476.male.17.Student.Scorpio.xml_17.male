I can SO see JD's actions after finishing that being the same as Franks after finishing his debate. "What just happened? Where am I?"  Anyway, JD did say some VERY insightful stuff there. Everything he said was right, but I don't think he quite got it all. And i can't say I blame him for missing some of it, because it's a tough thing to take seriously.   "The moment you stop believing in a system of cool vs. uncool, popular vs. unpopular and BE YOURSELF, your teen angst will be instantly cut in half (the other half being that of school, sex, and drugs). What I admire in a person and look for in a friend, as do most content young adults, is a confident and unique individual. What I don't like is a person who's always trying to fit in. Desparation, my good friends, is a turn off. Be confident, be an individual, and be alive."  Now, let me revise this a little and apply to more general things...   The moment you stop  believing  is the moment you see things as they are. The moment you can drop your preconcieved notions, and accept things for what they are, is the moment your angst will be gone. The moment you stop  believing  and start   discovering   is the moment you become and individual, and the moment you begin to learn who  you  are. And only when you know who  you  are, can you   discover   who other people are.   Like I said, that's probably not something many of you will be able to accept. And yes, truth is 99% subjective, but you must discover your truths, you can't go around your whole life beLIEving things and live well.
