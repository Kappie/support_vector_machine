Sean is a trooper (heh) for being our makeshift vis dude, making humorous and informative demonstrations on the proper way to march. We've started playing while marching, just A and B block, but it's better than nothin.   I didn't have to hip switch today! Woot! (meaning I did the exercize right lol)  Then, around 2:30, we got to the show music, after a quick run through of warmups. We went down the line doing the slur/staccato chromatics exercize, and in all actuality...we sound pretty damn good. The only issue was probably the mello section, but 3 of the 5 are completely new to the horn. They tried their best, and made us proud :) However. We didn't play good enough, so Sean made us run!!  YES! Running! Oooooh wow I've never been so happy for people to screw up. Running felt amazing, and I really hope we insitute it...cuz Champs are won in the winter months, so lets start winning, people!!  Anyway, we mainly focused on Third Wind and Minuano, with Jeff and I switching off on the Minuano solo. I played everything wonderfully, until the C at the end...somehow playing it in the brass ensemble sucks away my air, and no matter how wonderfully I play it alone...I couldn't speak that C. Anyway. doesn't matter.  Jeff did a decent job...he's got the high notes down, while I've got the rythyms down. Its a CHALLENGING solo. The rythyms are odd, with interesting intervals between notes...definitely not a breeze.   BUT! Apparently they can't make a decision between us two. John, who came into the ensemble rehearsal (battery and bit and brass, oh my!) as Jeff and I were splitting the two Minuano solos, came up behind us, and planted the idea of a duet, instead of a solo.   Hmmmmmmmm!!!   We sounded pretty good, we being the entire corps. We were missing quite a few people, and despite 2 new recruits, the brass line was incredibly reminicsent of last years unintentional minicorps. Missing a tenor, and a bottom bass....we still managed to provide a cohesive showcase for the parents trickling in to watch the last bits of rehearsal.   A good day over all, expect good things!
