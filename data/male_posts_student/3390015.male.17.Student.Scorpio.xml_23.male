I finished the rough rough draft of my movie, and am now in the tedious, painful, and even harder than the writing the first draft of REVISION!  The Timberwolves lost of course...oh that makes me so mad, but there's always next year!!  I've been reading "Are We Living in the End Times?" by Tim Lahaye  Jerry Jenkins...it's pretty good, a little childish in writing style, but I guess that makes it sorta easy to understand.  I've always been fascinated with the book of Revelation, it's an awesome book that is underrated! And though we may NOT be living in the end times, our generation really does have more reason to believe so than any other previous one.  Since I find revision on my script pretty difficult, I am not wasting any time and moving full steam ahead on other projects...such as my feature length mockumentary, and a movie entitled "Narrow House" that I think will be my best to date, though rather difficult to write.  Next week, I head off to Chicago...one of the coolest cities in the world, and then on to Iowa to see my grandparents, then onto Minnesota to visit my grandma, cousins, other family, and to visit Bethel College because I'm thinking of possibly attending...for many reasons, mainly because it's Christian school and it's in Minnesota...and I was born in Minneapolis and love the twin cities and MN in general, so I hope it works out.  So, I'll be going away for almost two weeks, starting next week.  au revoir! adios! arrivederci!
