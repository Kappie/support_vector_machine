I'm a little... nervous... about driving again, but it's a beautiful, warmish day and the roads are clear, so at least people won't be freaking out about driving on snow again.  I woke up this morning to find that the password I'd used for my aol account for 7 years suddenly is invalid.  Yeah.  Weird.  And every time I called AOL, I got disconnected.  I think there may be some sort of conspiracy going on here.  Bat Boy was phenomenal.  Sara was fantastic (and can we talk about the leaf bikini?  heh clicklicklicklick), as was the rest of the cast.  THey've been extended and will be at the Boston Center for the Arts again from January 3-January 25, so I'll be checking it out again, and you should, too.  I'm looking for internships in Boston right now.  Arts administration internships.  I've got a list of internships that the ART Institute has (bless their hearts- they number about a billion), and I'm going to look at the Wang Center, Boston Ballet, Boston Lyric Opera, Boston Symphony, Huntington Theatre Company, and whatever else I can find.  A wrench in the works with my Berklee-ness.  I got a letter saying they'd received my application, but that the spring semester is full.  I'm hoping I can talk them into admitting me for the spring.  Otherwise, I'll have to wait til summer semester and pull a Roo, commuting from the Cape to Berklee 3 or 4 or 5 days a week.  Fun, eh?  Not so much, but I want in now, and if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.  I haven't had time to read in the last 3 days.  Ew.  Gotta get on that.  Teddy Roosevelt awaits.  Funny conversation with Meredith last night, who was, shall we say... just a liiiittle bit tired.  Not funny "ha ha" mind you, just... funny.  Well yeah, sometimes it was funny "ha ha." :)  The next two days will see me jumping from NH to Boston about 5 times, followed by the start of my deployment assignment in NH for a week and a half.  Hopefully a little R, but what are the chances there?  Anyone out there a gospel fan?  I'm looking for some good gospel music.  Lyric time.  This one's Josh Groban's "To Where You Are" Talk about it.  Who can say for certain  Maybe you're still here  I feel you all around me  Your memory's so clear   Deep in the stillness  I can hear you speak  You're still an inspiration  Can it be That you are mine  Forever love  And you are watching over me from up above   Fly me up to where you are  Beyond the distant star  I wish upon tonight  To see you smile  If only for awhile to know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are   Are you gently sleeping  Here inside my dream  And isn't faith believing  All power can't be seen   As my heart holds you  Just one beat away  I cherish all you gave me everyday  'Cause you are mine  Forever love  Watching me from up above  And I believe  That angels breathe  And that love will live on and never leave   Fly me up  To where you are  Beyond the distant star  I wish upon tonight  To see you smile  If only for awhile  To know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are   I know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are  -----  And I'm spent.  Driving home in a few.  I'll write again soon.  Cait, call me if you read this and let me know if we're still hanging out tonight.
