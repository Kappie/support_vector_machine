I'm out to show Hollywood you can make a hilarious movie without all the nasty stuff, mine is just straight up funny.  I'm trying to write and now I'm mad! It all started when I wanted to have some nice repeating music to listen to, so I vistited the Garden State website to have some surreal music to get my mind in the writing zone so to say, but NO! The site has been changed somehow in literally the span of one day. There were special features, pics, desktops, all kinds of crap last time, and the music, the music wasn't there this time, nor was any of that other stuff!  Oh the humanity!
