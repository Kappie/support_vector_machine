With a car and a liscense, you can pick up more chicks (girls), act out, and not get caught by your parents. By acting out I mean the basics- sitting back in your seat in order to obscure your visual view of the road, cranking up the music so you can't hear the nasty insaults from the on coming traffic, and reving the engine as you pull into people's driveways.  Cool, eh?  Yea dawg.  Guess what? I can do the same things on my tractor, excluding the music. Yet people would think I was nuts. And there in lies the absolute fact that cool is relative to the situation.
