Yet she will win, and quickly...I am beaten, weakened, tired.  The mind, hours ago positively apoptic with thought, now lethargically casts away its trimmings for sullied bedclothes.  The Atlanta airport deserves description, as do flights at night, my fear of flying, the wonderful book Moneyball, my favorite screenplay, the prospects of interviewing celebrities, and sex with girls in boot-cut jeans.  Yet no, it is lost.  In 10 days I will ride the Terminal T escelator again, curious if it represents our ascent to Heaven.    Tonight, a bed in a home I recognize, even though my mom just moved in two months ago.
