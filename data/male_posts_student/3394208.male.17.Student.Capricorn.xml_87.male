Now Daphne runs far from love fearing to be wed  And Apollo will chase her till the day gods will have been killed  It's a beauty wasted since she fears love  But to Apollo it's a beautiful sight as Daphne flies like a dove  And as Apollo caught up and Daphne has tired  Daphne calls her father; help is what she asks; for what had transpired  She get's her wish but is unable to move an inch  Her feet get rooted, her skin turns to bark and her hair replaced with leaves  But Apollo still loves her even in her present state  Apollo truly in love has no sign of hate  Apollo gazes at Daphne because she's everything he sees  Respects and still loves her dearly even as a laurel tree   (my poetic rendition of Daphne and Apollo)
