I have been listening to the jam a genius punk band, and playing the bass. I can't wait until our band, schitzo facto, play at scream next. I prefer the name "in the flesh" but some (really stupid) bastards think it sounds death-metalish and this has influenced david's mind in to thinking it sounds shitty. Go to www.biggerdave.blogspot.com to tell him what a fool he is for thinking this. In The flesh means... we're here retards, not we are in your bodies for fuck sake grow a brain cell. If you think "in the flesh" means the latter your a retard and I'm not your friend so go away.
