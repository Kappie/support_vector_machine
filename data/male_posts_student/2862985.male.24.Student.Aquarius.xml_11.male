Got to know a nice song recently. Went reservist the last two weeks and caught up with some of the army friends. Its really a nice feeling to be able to catch up with one another again after a year. Sometimes really feel that reservist is good in the sense that it stops everybody from busy doing what they are doing and get together. This year's reservist is a memorable one as it includes our battalion's celebration of getting the Best NS Unit yet again. The celebration is being held at the Chevleron(did I get the spelling right?). Anyway, its a really nice place. compared to the previous one at Beach Road. Went to Gan's wedding dinner on Tuesday night. He is now driving a super car which I doubt I can ever find a second one in Singapore. I also not sure what the car is but I think it is specially imported from Japan. After seeing the two of them together for so long, I was real happy to see them getting married. He only invited me in 1 SIR, I guess I am really his best friend there. Wishing him all the best, his business would get better and better , his car more and more posh, and may he be a father real soon.. Hee.. Fabian is now in Taiwan. Feels that we have been talking to each other less and less. He seems upset everytime I meet him and I don't know why. Just bathe Brownie a couple of hours ago, she's getting smelly. Going to watch Spiderman2 with Sumitro and Shirley and Grace later in the evening. I also dunno what I am doing..... SIGHZ..........      情人节的前一天   他离开你身边   只剩下你情不至尽的想恋     那一夜我陪着你   你哭了一阵夜   你是否知道我对他一样很想恋     至到有一天我和他碰面   在那间我们常去的咖啡店     才知道有些感受   我和他谁都不曾说出口   我们之间隐藏了什么   处了我自己没人懂     可是你你怎么说   你只道好时不时从此必开我   我一样难过   多希望我们不曾相似过     才知道有些感受    我和他谁都不曾说出口   我们都是最好的朋友   谁会有勇气去开口     不再哭不再难过   我们还有好大好大的天空   故事的最后   我们都不曾失去过什么
