I went with my mom to visit my Grandmother and to visit both La Virgen De Guadalupe and La Virgen De Juquila. My mom believes alot in these Virgens and so do I so we had to go and pay a visit to them, we had to pray a little while and then we were on our way to the home town of my dad and mom. We took a bus that took 10-12 hours to get there.The town was called Sta. Maria De Zacatepe, Oaxaca. After 2 days of being here i got to get the hang of it. I liked it alot. The first two days i didn't feel like doing anything. I was all sad and depressed because i didnt get to talk to person i wanted to talk to. Then the next day I went to my aunt's house and i hung out with my cousin whose name was Tania. She was my best friend, she was my favorite cousin, she was the person i admired the most. I loved her just as much as my aunt. My aunt was the same. Her name was Coral. She was my favorite aunt, my best friend. I loved both very much. OKay so for the nest 11 days i said i was going to spend it with my aunt or my cousin. MOstly everyday me my uncle and my cousin Andres went to play soccer in the afternoon. Everyday it rained and some of those days we stayed playing even though it was raining. I had dound 4 scars becuase in Mexico there is mostly no grass so that u can play soccer its dirt (tierra). I like the scars they look kind of cool but that is just a weird thing   about me. So in mexico me and my cousin were like if we knew each other for our whole life. For that little time i was there we passed evry single feeling u can think for someone. But out of all feelings we were always happy. We laughed we cried. we yelled at each other, anything u can think of. I saw her cry three times. and she saw me cry once. So we knew each other well. She talked to me when i was crying and i talked to her when she was crying. One of the times that she was crying was because of my fault. First i had gone to her house like at 9:00 in the morning so i spent most of my morning there. We ate and she was cleaning. So we made our own volleyaball court because she had said that she was better than me and that she could beat me. So first game she won and then second game she won. SO then we started to wet each other and had fun like that for like half an hour. Then she said something about me and i was like i dont need u anyways ur not anybody important to me. I was like you could die and it wouldnt matter to me i would bring u a rose and thats it it would be white to.. BUt   everybody knows that i like to play around but my cousin it is, she took it for real (she very sensitive). SO she went by the tank of water and started crying i thought she was faking it. Then i stuck by her all day until she felt better. The funny person that i am i kept making her laugh while she was crying even though she was kinda of mad at me. The next day she wouldnt talk to me and she wouldnt talk to me the next day. She just spent it with my other cousin (he was a boy too) she kept joking around with him and stuff and i think she was trying to make me jealous and it did work. In the end we still talked to each other alot. We spent every afternoon together. We played soccer one game, it was one neighborhood agaisnt another (barrio contra barrio) and our barrio had one and we had bet 20 pesos each person. SO then the girls decided to do a game so so did the little kids. I saw the little kids game it was funnyand i only got to see one game of the girls. I didnt get to see all of it because it was the day i was going to leave. I only saw half of the game and the team that my cousin Tania was on was winning she had scored a goal. My cousin brought out all then pretty girls outside. Three of them were really pretty, i forgot two of their names but i remember one of them. The girl's name was Karen i thought she was the best out of all of them, that is the girl that i gave #10 for a soccer jersey number. (10 to me is the best to me). Oh yeah 4 years ago when i went with my whole family i liked two girls, thier names wer Anita and Annayeli ( i think thats how u spell it) I like Annayeli a little better. SO when I came back this year everybody thought i still like them, Specially my cousin Tania so every time i went to Anita's store evry thought i went to go and see her. Man everyone crazy down there. But annayeli had moved so i didnt really get to see her. Well i had lots of fun down there and i cant wait unti next year so i can go back and have even more fun.
