Culturally, what defines a person's gender?   The way they act towards certain things. No matter what though; your gender is defined by what you look like, not by what you do.  2. Does your mood define what you do, or does what you do define your mood?  The former.  3. When making lists, do you prefer numbers or bullets?  I try not to be prejudiced, I try to use them both equally to not make the other feel bad.
