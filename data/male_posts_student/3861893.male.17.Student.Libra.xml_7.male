I have seen this guy grow from the crappy guy he was in secondary school to the wise guy now. Was a little surprised this morning when you told me about the "second coming" and the Babylon. Actually, I haven't really thought about this thing. All I have is only some brief idea about what it is. Haha. Maybe I will go read up more about it when I'm free. Haha.  Also had Chemistry practical today. Was so long and difficult. Those experiments required so much reagents that the entire bench was very messy. Ended up some of my titration numbers are wrong. And didn't really bothered to alter the numbers. I just hate those times when there are so much things to do and yet so little time to complete. Had to really rush and so didn't really have time to organise the things properly. Sigh.  Had this interesting chat with Jane about the word "cute". Haha. I think I said that she was cute and she kept insisting that cute meant ugly but adorable. She said that I implied that she was ugly but adorable. Haha. Well, that wasn't what I meant. Haha. According to Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, the word cute means "attractive or pretty especially in a dainty or delicate way". See, I wasn't saying anything bad about her. Haha. She also said that Aaron said the same thing about her. Haha. Great minds think alike.  Received back my GP essay and my economics examinations. Sigh. The results have dropped. I must really start pulling up my socks. Was really afraid that I would fail the economics examination after Mrs Lee said that very little people in the class passed the exam. She drew this stupid pie chart and showed us the percentage passes. Eventually, when we got back the papers, things didn't really turn out the way she said it was. The moment I got back the case study section, I was so happy. I passed case study. Though it was just a miserable 16 out of 30, I was quite glad because I knew that if I passed the case study section, I would pass the entire examination. Thank God I passed! Sometimes, I really think that teachers always like to exaggerate things to make students more worried and anxious. They always resort to tricks like this to make us nervous and panicky. Maybe they should try out other more effective methods.  6 more weeks to prelims. Must really start to work hard. And also must start believing that I will do well. Because there can be miracles when you believe.  When You Believe  (Whitney Houston  Mariah Carey)  Many nights we prayed With no proof anyone could hear In our hearts a hope for a song We barely understood  Now we are not afraid Although we know there’s much to fear We were moving mountains Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes  There can be miracles When you believe Though hope is frail It's hard to kill  Who knows what miracles You can achieve When you believe somehow you will You will when you believe  In this time of fear When prayer so often proves in vain Hope seems like the summer bird Too swiftly flown away  Yet now I'm standing here My heart’s so full, I can't explain Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say  There can be miracles When you believe Though hope is frail It's hard to kill  Who knows what miracles You can achieve  When you believe somehow you will You will when you believe  They don't know it's often when you ask, uh And it's easy to give in to your fear, uh  But when you’re blind you find your pain Can see or wake me through the rain? Boy, am I still resilient voice? Says love is the relief, oh   There can be miracles  When you believe Though hope is frail  It's hard to kill   Who knows what miracles You can achieve  When you believe somehow you will  Somehow you will You will when you believe  That's about all. I think its time to go to bed. Good Night.
