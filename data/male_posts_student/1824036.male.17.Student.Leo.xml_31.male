I’m going to reserve Matt Morgan for next years consideration.  I’m going to award the Kurt Angle Rookie of the Year Trophy to two men:  Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas .  These two guys have a legitimate background in amateur wrestling.  Shelton was Brock Lesnar’s college roommate, and Charlie Haas was the runner up for the NCAA championship the year Lesnar won the National Championship.  Kurt Angle proved right off that a sucessful amateur wrestler can pull it off in the WWE.  He paved the road for Brock Lesnar.  Now we have two more guys with successful backgrounds in amateur wrestling.  These two gentlemen have put on awesome matches with a number of tag-teams, including two MOTY candidates versus Los Guerroes.  Both of them have the potential to break out on their own, given a proper gimmick.  I can see them main eventing against eachother  at WrestleMania XXV.   Tag-Team of the Year:   It pains me to see tag-team wrestling be a mere shadow that it once was.  There have been a few bright spots this year, though.  The Dudley Boys had a great run after reuniting, and I’m guessing they’re not done yet.  The Bashams showed up on the scene, and they’re looking to be a force to be reckoned with.  The World’s Greatest Tag Team has been wowing me with their abilities as well.  The rest of the year has seen cookie cutter teams like RVD  Kane, and GoldDust   (my main man) Booker T.  However, the winner of the Strike Force Tag Team of the Year Trophy goes to  Los Guerroes,  Eddie and Chavo.  They’re teasing a break-up and a possible WrestleMania XX match, but they’re exploits in 2003 were worth watching.  Not only the lie, cheat  steal gimmick, but their abilities in the ring.  They put on not one, but two matches that were candidates for MOTY vs. Benjamin and Haas.  I hope their matches against eachother are as awesome as their matches with eachother.   Breakout Star of the Year:  Word Life!  I wasn’t writing for a wrestling blog last year.  But if I had, I would have handed this award to Rob Van Dam.  Therefore, after the way RVD has been treated by the WWE, I’m afraid to hand this award out to the guy I think who burst from out of nowhere to capture the wrestling fans’ attention:  John Cena.       Angle of the Year:  So many good angles saw fruition, while others died an immature death  Kane vs. Shane McMahon was a good one.  So was the rise and fall of Chris Benoit.  Not to mention the evolution of Evolution.  That angle, if booked correctly, will carry into 2004 as one of the best angles since the days of the Four Horsemen.  But the Angle of the Year for 2003 was easily between two non-wrestlers.  It was the fight for control of RAW.  The N w O angle of the year award goes to Stone Cold  Steve Austin vs. Eric Bischoff.    Those two fought each other verbally and physically for most of the year.  Hell, when RAW was at it’s weakest, storyline-wise, Austin engaged Bischoff in a Pie-Eatin’ contest, featuring Mae Young! (Those ain’t puppies…those are bassett hounds).  Biscoff got the best of Austin at survivor Series, but we all know that Stone Cold 3:16 will be back soon.    Match of the Year:  I saw some awesome matches this year.  (Oddly, none of them involved HHH. ) There was a ladder match on Raw between RVD and Christian which I consider a second runner-up.  The first runner-up would be the match between Chris Jericho and Shawn Micheals  at WM XIX.  The hands down winner of the Ricky Steamboat/Randy Savage Match of the Year Trophy goes to  Brock Lesnar  Kurt Angle’s IronMan Match.    Read back a few pages in this blog and you’ll see my commentary on that match.  The best part about that match was that it was on free TV.  Now that RAW and SmackDown! Are alternating their PPV’s, one brand has to put a better-than-great match on TV every other month.  And finally we get to the top trophy, the Bruno Sammartino Plaque for Wrestler of the Year:  And the runners-up are, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, “Whiskerbiscuit” Bill Goldberg, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Kane, the Undertaker…  And the winner is…   Brock Lesnar.   Brock managed to carry on his monster gimmick, but also prove that he wasn’t just dumb muscle.  He showed us that he could wrestle a match with the Big Show, and still pull off a pure science match with Kurt Angle.  At WrestleMania XIX, he botched his shooting star press, landed on his head and gave himself a nasty concussion, but still managed to pull off the finish as planned.  I don’t know if Brock can be a breakout star like Stone Cold Steve Austin or Hulk Hogan were in the mainstream.  But for my money, Brock Lesnar is the best thing going in Professional Wrestling today.
