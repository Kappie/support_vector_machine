This time, we’re setting off for the west, metaphorically wagon-train-ing to Las Vegas with about a million stops along the way. It’ll be just like the pioneers, except with motels and a car with XM Satellite Radio and DVD Entertainment System. Our stops will be made in Denver, Beaver Creek/Vail, Grand Junction, Moab (Arches National Park), Bryce  Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, The Grand Canyon (North Rim) and finally ending our trip at the fabulous Paris Las Vegas Resort  Casino. It actually looks to be a great trip, even with the cumulative week spent in National Park Lodging. Because EW! I might be Audioblogging a bit from these locations, which will be fun because I’ve wanted to try that out for a while now and now I have an excuse. After my return, I plan to post a short day-by-day recaplet piece at What Kind of Day Has It Been, which I will then continue to blog on a weekly basis. Cheerio!  Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
