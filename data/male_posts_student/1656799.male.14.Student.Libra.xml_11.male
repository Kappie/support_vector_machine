Hopefully I won't have to feel how I did in the past week for a long while, because lets face it, life doesn't last forever.  So with those thoughts in mind, I have achieved nothing over the past weekend. That is correct, I've been playing Championship Manager again, and you've only got those little monkeys at  urlLink SIGames  to blame. With my nerves of steel, determination and lust for caffeine, I managed to push Montrose into the Scottish Premier League, which I'm not sure whether to be ashamed or proud of.  Obtained  urlLink Fruity Loops  and  urlLink Cubase , have started using Fruity Loops, however a lack of music editing knowledge, I've only been able to create a standard rock rthymn on drums, which may be impressive depending on what you do with it. I'll give Cubase a go later, not sure whether to expect something even more mind-boggling than Fruity Loops or something more easier to understand.  I haven't been searching around the interweb recently for any new websites of interest, but I can bring you to the attention of the new blogs at  urlLink Weebl  Bob .  One website was brought to my head just as I typed the previous paragraph, it is a web comic, and I think its nicely done. If you have some free time, check out  urlLink Phish-D . I'm unsure whether the site is up at this moment in time, but do check it out if you can.  I suppose in the future I should update this blog with something just remotely interesting, and I hope to do so tomorrow. Perhaps I should take my camera into school again and see what creativity urges me to do . . . (creativity?)  Toodles.
