I saw this old lady. She was crossing the road after doing her marketing. Then, in the middle of the road, a speeding taxi zoomed passed. There was this loud screeching sound of the tyres... Then, there was this loud BANG!, followed by the sound of a dead body hitting the floor... Even though in the midst of the traffic, everything seems kinda quiet... For a moment, everyone stopped... On the floor, the old lady was dead. With her head facing the sky... Then, the taxi sped off... I immediately called the ambulance. From this, we can see that we are such fragile creatures. In a blink of an eye, we may be dead. It also shows that we are such self-centered creatures. We only care about our own well-being. Just like the taxi driver and his passengers who sped off. They could have helped by checking if the old lady was still alive or not, but, they just sped off. Thinking of only themselves. Is this what we should really be? Is this what God created us to be? Humanity itself is full of flaws...  What I wish for now is to be able to sleep without having any nightmarish dreams. I saw how a person died today. It's not like watching the television, as it is the real thing. I really wished that I did not see that incident today. It just keeps on replaying in my mind. It won't stop. I really wish that it would just stop... I wish that it would all just go away... I wished that it would just leave me alone... go away...    They can have my gun when they pry it from my cold dead fingers...
