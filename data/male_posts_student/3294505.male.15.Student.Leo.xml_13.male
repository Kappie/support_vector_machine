I like both of them as a friend, and I don't care if the time were to come where I'd eventually end up going out with one of said chicks. But it seems to me [sure I could and most likely be wrong..] they're making me choose.  A friend of mine who graduated decides to gloat all about his prom to me while my away message last night decides to magially have me return, so I wake up to a "talking to himself" conversation that contains him going on and on about how he was prom king and how he almost had anal with this chick and how he made out with random big tittied chicks too. I REALLY don't care about who, how, and when you're gonna score with a chick, Mike, [Yes his name is Mike too] just like I would imagine you not to care what I did either.  The only good thing is that I didnt do too bad this half-markin' period. Other than that I really dont know what the hell I'm supposed to do with minimal, yes, but annoying all the same, problems that are piling up on top of these. I have no idea what I want. Its like I'm losing friends, and its probably my fault. Usually everything is. I'm used to it.  Oh well, I guess....
