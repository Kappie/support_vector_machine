Blazing squad trail-blazed their way into the charts as a fresh-faced pop phenomenon, with such heart rending songs as crossroads and other unremarkable attempts that appear frequently in compilation albums aimed at a sophisticated niche market: Mega bombastic summer hits from the craziest garage garages 2004 volume 5 Extreme Double-Bass, attracts a certain following, a following that drive funny looking cars, who gather in cow fields with glow sticks, and most habitually meet, throwing their hands in the air, making you think; these people just don’t care.  To me, Da Blazing Squad are note-worthy for their unwitting discovery of a secret message, they latched onto a gem of an idea, a piece of heavenly logic, streets ahead of the Streets, communicating to the heart of our youth culture. To flip reverse, is to turn upside down inside, abandoning old thinking patterns, reversing into a state of unlearning, while having the ‘odd’ new logic revealed to us, which will take us forward. I certainly need flip reversing, often, in most areas of my life, from one form of thinking to another. Even the people who profess ‘not to care’, aren’t convincing in not caring, when they shout to you about the irrelevance of the issue that is ‘nothing’, sticking steadfastly to their ‘not caring’ attitude. Have you noticed that people who ‘don’t care’, mention their non caring with flamboyant feeling and gusto, they begin gesticulating with their arms (the thing that Italian football players do when pleading with the referee), they launch into a tirade about the ‘nothing’ issue, spittle flies out, angry words spew out, their face begins contorting, and they conclude defiantly: ‘I just couldn’t care less.’ I wonder.  I believe that many want to flip reverse it, because they do care. Starting to consider whether they should whack on the hand-brake, performing an extravagant U-turn, leaving behind the race designed for rats, to exercise their freedom in initiating change; walking away from the consensus, ignoring the status quo. What occurs when we flip reverse it? Rationality becomes irrational, logic-illogical, reason-unreasonable, thinking-unthinkable, ordinary-extraordinary; the tread-mill process of our mind reduces in activity, so we may have the opportunity to question why it rotates in a certain direction and not the other. People will be able to tell when you have flip reversed it. They’ll remark on the change. How effective the unexplained unseen has been in transforming your life, dragging you away from mundane conformity.  “As in this case of the wind, the effects were seen, the sound was heard, important changes were produced by it, trees and clouds were moved, yet the wind is not seen, nor do we know whence it comes, nor by what laws it is governed; so it is with the operations of the Spirit.”  ‘Get a life’, ‘You haven’t got much of a life’, ‘You’re so boring’. Ever heard it before? Others extolling you to get a life, as if it was something that you could obtain, something you could shop for at the supermarket, something which you received after much trying. “He that finds his life will lose it; and he that loses his life for my sake will find it”. To find life: flip reverse it, lose it.  Success in life will be your making, at least so I’m told. You have to be the best, in the highest position, with authority over others, money for luxuries, straight A’s in your studies, a complete winner in every situation. ‘If you don’t become something, all you’ll do is serve others and miss out on your lot, the portion which you deserve because of your greatness.’ “But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.” A paradoxical enigma about the ranking in the kingdom. Flip reverse it; become nothing, be happy to be considered last.  Ever seen a travelling throng of girls heading for a week in the Spanish sun? They most definitely haven’t forgotten the toothbrush, or anything else for that matter. Loaded up with enough outfits to set up a small fashion boutique, and never understanding the wisdom of ‘travelling light’. We hoard, own much, possess mountains, and gather like a magpie, being engulfed by materials, keeping for the sake of sentimentality, holding for the need of comfort. “Take nothing for the journey except a staff – no bread, no bag, no money.” Flip reverse it; travel light, offload the burden, become a stream-lined racing horse.  Unashamedly there are people who admit that money is the real door opener. That all they desire is riches. They are engrossed in the endless pursuit of wealth. People consider money as the chief good, something that brings an answer to each and every problem. The new album of 50 cent is titled ‘Get rich or die trying’; wealth has become the ultimate goal, our release from misery, our opportunity to live opulent lives. Poverty is a disgusting word, a condition to avoid like the plague. The welfare state offers a cure, money; politics has become economy management, and your salary indicates your status. Watching ‘Cribs’ on MTV shows us what the depraved human heart desires, excess at the detriment of others. “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God”. Flip reverse it; give generously, seek the kingdom of God, and desire true riches stored in heaven.  Don’t fool yourself into thinking that you are intelligent. I am stupid if I think that I’m intelligent because I have a degree. My wisdom is foolishness, I know nothing, and cannot boast about my cleverness. All wisdom is found in Christ, therefore, I cannot find it in me, but I can find it in Christ who lives in me. Without Christ our intelligence amounts to nothing. And we honour ourselves with scrolls, wear funny hats at may-day, take up important seats of learning, give ourselves fancy titles, and pride ourselves at being educated, a cut above the rest, in a league of Doctors and Masters. “But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.” Flip reverse it; boast about your weakness, acknowledge where wisdom and truth come from, and know that all our knees will bow.  Our standards can be flip reversed at the drop of a hat; and they will be. Death can be good. Poverty equally so, also weakness, add to that forgiveness and a portion of humble pie. Lord, da Blazing Squad hit the nail on the head, now flip reverse me.
