Essendon having lost the last 5 of its past 6 matches... yeah damn. Personally I thought, and a lot of other ppl in football land, didnt give Essendon a hope to get into the finals let alone win it. We had been playing horrible football. loss after loss. But things have changed since then. Port Adelaide are one of the top teams in the competition at the moment, and really are in form. Going into this match every one would have been tipping Port to win this match. Not just because that they are a top team, but also backed up by the fact that Essendon are without so many of their star players. Their captain, Centre half forward, a defender, possibly our best one. Yet we won by 40 points. That is a huge victory!  Because of this i now have huge bragging rights to Lehamn(... how do you spell that?) and yes tonight at church you will see me in my Essendon guernsey.  Cu tonight  Tim
