This one isn't really such a big surprise. Just Biscombe and Charlotte fighting. Which one is winning? I bet you its me. YES, IN THAT WAY.       This isn't such a big surprise either. Lauren thinks she's cool. Too bad she doesn't eyes in the back of her head, that'll be way cooler, no?       More fighting? Hey, you can kinda see part of Ryan in this picture. Hey, he does exist.       They started doing each other's hair. This is Biscombe's famous hairdo done by the world famous Charlotte.       Charlotte's famous hairdo done by Burly Biscombe?       Done by the wonderful Becca, this is my hairdo. Of death.       Pat's semi-weird fluffy hairdo. Err...sweet.       I'm gonna leave you with the coolest picture I took all night. I have no idea how I did it. I think its that I took the camera away before it was done flashing or something. I want to recreate this but I guess it works better for artificial lights than natural light. Coolest picture...eva.   Happy Trails.
