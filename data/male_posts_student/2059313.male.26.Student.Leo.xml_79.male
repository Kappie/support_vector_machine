There was no worship going on other than that of two creative minds trying to bring glory to God through 70 feet of steel trussing, 30 feet of chain, and ten ETC SourFour ParNel lights.  By three o'clock, we had created a masterpiece.  There was one large 30 foot section and two smaller (only slightly) 20 foot sections.  The larger section was suspended in air at an angle of 20-30 degrees from horizontal.  The other two sections intersected that one... one on the left suspended by one end at an angle of around 70-80 degrees.  The third section was on the right and was suspended at an angle of around 45 degrees.  We hung the ten lights on the trussing sections and aimed them AT the trusses in order to actually light up the trussing and paint it like a canvas for lights.  We used an awesome blue called Zephyr Blue and an excellent green color, along with lighting it from the top with a Salmon color to give it some "heat".  When we were done, we tested it out.  This structure gives the feeling of a cold, desolate industrial kind of area, with a touch of heat, but not like warm-happy-good-feeling heat... a nasty, hot, sweaty, yukky hot heat-ness.  Satisfied with our job.  We praised God and left, thankful that He has given us these awesome gifts, and grateful that we are able to use them for His Glory!
