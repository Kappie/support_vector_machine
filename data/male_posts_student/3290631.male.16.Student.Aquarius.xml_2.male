This is not the huge news I mentioned below,  that  news is postive news.  Furthermore, I might buy myself the study book for Literature SAT II (which i signed up for but later figured I'd decline since mostly Juniors take it) and maybe peruse through it and take a diagnostic test.  If I'm not some kind of a guru at it, I won't take it either--If I am I will take it instead of the World History SAT II.
