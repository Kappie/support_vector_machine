I want to touch up on one of those moments that could have possibly been a classic and produced an awesome new match for the "fed". Remember when Al Snow and Big Boss Man were feuding and after pepper (Snow's dog) died? (he was actually kidnapped in Ames Iowa (about 100 miles from here)) Well then they decided to have a match called the "Kennel from Hell". I personally thought that this match was going to be awesome!   Why is that Peter?   Well now. The match was going to be the original Cage surrounding the ring. With the Hell in a Cell cage around/over top of that. Then in between those two cages there were going to be 2 or 3 rottweilers. You had to escape the first cage and then proceed into the empty space between the cell and the cage, fend off the rottweilers, and escape the cell. Sounds pretty sweet huh?   HELL YEAH!   WRONG! The dogs, who hadn't been exposed to so many people, spent most of the match just pooping and peeing all over ringside. And when the match finally ended nothing happened. The dogs didn't go after anyone between the cages. They just ran around and barked and released their bodily fluids all over. THAT WAS STUPID!!!
