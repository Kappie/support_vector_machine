While I'm excited about getting out, I'm not excited about finals.  I'm sure I'll do OK on them but you can't help but be nervous.  Right now I'm thinking about summer.  I want this summer to be the best ever.  But for now, I am just thinking that I don't want it to be like last summer.  Last summer I was extremely lazy and did nothing productive.  Nothing at all.  You might have noticed I moved the site from Blog*Spot to my own domain.  That's because I now have a host with FTP instead of FrontPage.  So you won't see any ads anymore :-)  I'd like to thank BLOGGER for making it free :-)  For as long as I have this blog, you'll see the BLOGGER banner at the bottom.  Today's song of the day is: "Porcelain" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers  That's all for now.
