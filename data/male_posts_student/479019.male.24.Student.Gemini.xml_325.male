(you-know-who) situation... cause I know deep down inside I do like her a lot or at least want to like her a lot. I know I acted and said somethings that are rather unbecoming of me... due to my confusion, but nothing really bad. I think she understands my position, just as I understand hers.  I'm feeling pretty confident and good right now... despite still have lingering thoughts of her. It helped a lot going out with Stephanie and her friends. Not really my types... but still spending New Years with 4 extremely beautiful girls and getting props from strangers is great. Another thing that makes me feel good is... well (you-know-who) was / is cool enough that I didn't keep it secret... and well it was pretty obvious some people were jealous after hearing the story. It's nice to know that people want me... after not getting the object of your desire.  In rotation today is  Pulley  and  Alkaline Trio   ****
