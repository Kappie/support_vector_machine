They're all phone Nazis.  Every freakin one of them.  Oh well.  Anyways, after talking to a new friend yesterday (its 12am...so yesterday is correct..whatever), and made her a mod for my boards.  Too bad she lives in freakin Chicago Illnois.  Oh well, she said she's planning to come out here.  I'm hoping we'll eventually meet.  Shes quite awesome.  She loves Invader ZIM, which doubly-rocks because nobody likes it anymore, I'm like one of those dying breeds.  ZIM rocks.  Anyways, we talked for a looong time.  Like..really long.  She's cool, and I wish she lived out here.  Because she rocks.  In other news, my forums are going strong with...drumroll please...7 MEMBERS!  Wow.  Join up, there's a link on the sidebar on this blog too, so you can sign up and have fun with all 7 members.  Be one of the few, the proud, the...I don't really know but yeah.  My computer works.  I love it.  I taped some old piece of cardboard that says "Chameleon" on it.  So my computer now has a name.  Scary.  I'll shove a pic up online later today.  Along with something I'm making on my computer.  It's like...a ride at Knott's...but cooler.  It shows my mad skillz with CAD.  Yeah, well.  I'm really friggin tired and I just did a bunch of homework so....bye.
