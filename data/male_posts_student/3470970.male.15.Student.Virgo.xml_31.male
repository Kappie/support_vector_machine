Now that the end of the school year has come, many people are leaving, some of whom were friends of mine, I guess its just frustrating that people who I was hanging out with and saw as my friends are leaving now, of course, that still leaves us as friends, but its just not the same. Oh well, I guess I wnet through this many times before so I won't get emotional, somehow being emotional doesn't work out with me. I'm trying to explain this without going into too much detail, I want this post to make sense. Anyhow, this was my last going-out-getting-pissed night for this school year. I'm sure Sophie will have a few photos up on  urlLink her site .  Another thing that lately came up was "downloading mp3s = communism". It's not supporting communism if you download MP3s from the internet, it's just having fun, ruining the record companies' business. After all, we don't want those loser G-unit idiots to get rich, do we?!    Oh well, I guess the "red monster" is being picked on and blamed again. Comrade.
