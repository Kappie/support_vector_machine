Tyler, Brad and I are going for it. I think we can do it. im not tired at all and i have plaenty of things to do. Its only a matter of time before my brother gets home though, then i will have to be all quiet. bah.  brad started a blog. i suspect it to be pretty good, as he has quite the mind.  schools end approaches.  i will probably make another post within the night as i will be up pretty long. so ill update you on its success or failure.  Project 86's new CD came out and its good like a south american charm. jeez its so awsome. Its called "songs to burn your bridges by." you need to get it.  today at work we had a visit from some friends. tyler and i go t out past 11!!!! holy crap. Jerry, Danny, Justin, and Mystery X came in and were hangin out for a while. it was cool though, its all good. danny was swooning katie hugo apparently, saying he was larry. he was on jerrys phone with here for like 45 minutes. WEIRD.  Glen is still gone. yea hes gone like a bottom leaf ice formation. he went up to hume lake for the summer. I will see him within the month, so its not too devistating. i can nessle in his warm body again soon. very soon.  current song: project 86 - safe haven current time: 1:16 am  how could i go without trying this picture thing???? behond.... brad.  urlLink     urlLink
