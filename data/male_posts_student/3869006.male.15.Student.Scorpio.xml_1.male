Ashleigh is the Greatest, and I would do anything for her... umm... today I woke up at like 10:30am so I missed ashleigh buy a bit ;). I spent the night before last night at Ashleigh's grandparents house, while they were house sitting :D. When I got back I went to Ashleigh's house and we watched a movie, she fell asleep and then her mom gave me a ride home... at 2:30 in the morning. Well I didn't do anything terribly important today... Lovingly Loving you, ~Sean
