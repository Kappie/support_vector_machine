Host: "Who is the president of the united states of america?" Gollum: "My Precious....."  Host:"Errr........Which recording artist was recently charged with child molestation?" Gollum:"My Precious....."  Host:"Gollum........Here, let me keep the ring for you......" Gollum:"NO~!! Tall evil woman wants to steal our precious!" Smeagle:"Woman is not evil. Woman is our friend....."  Gollum: *spits* "Tall woman is evil~!!! Tall woman is not our friend.......tall woman is too tall........too tall is not our friend........" Smeagle:"No........Smeagle will not let you hurt Tall woman......tall woman is smeagle's master......"  Host: "oh yuk.........i might be female and i might like older men but you r way too old.............oh god........and senile too......can you please put on a pair of pants?"  Smeagle: "Smeagle does not fancy master.........Smeagle wants to serve master......Smeagle is too gay to fancy master......Smeagle only fancies Gollum.........Gollum is my love......"  Host: "oh yuk..........and stop staring up my skirt~!!!!!"   speaking of schizos.........ever wondered if those superheros in comic books ever suffered from schizophrenia? i mean.....they have secret identities and stuff.........and lead double lives..........isnt it just possible that maybe one of them got too carried away? that would be interesting..................batman sitting in his cave going, "My Precious......."  back to the topic abt brainiest kids...........i noticed that the kid who won the last brainiest title had a big head, was extremely skinny and big specs..........now we know what happens when you push your kid too much.........he becomes malnourished.........now all ya have to do i give him a nice shiny ring and...........yea.....all together now........"My Precious".....
