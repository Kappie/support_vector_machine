Someone close to me once said something that stuck with me, "There are good intentions and then there is the real world." He went on to explain that in the real world most people in business are looking out for number one, themselves.       This was part of the game. People like Kozlowski, Lay, Barbakow, and Scrushy took it too far, but what they were doing in a milder form was nothing new. The company I work for also faces these types of issues.  Example: Recently it was announced that my organization was to be acquired by another organization and the deal was for a cash buy out of $15 per share. Our stock prior to the announcement was $6 per share a 52 week low. Turns out that two months prior to the finished deal, upper management exercised stock options for bonuses including our CEO who was given 900,000 shares at $6 a share. Coincidence? Probably not.      Does this bother me? Unfortunately it doesn't. At least not yet. But those other 18,000 employees that were given stock options when the stock was $32 a share and then watched them dwindle to $6, I can understand where they are coming from.        So back to Jim and his dilemma. What I would do if I were Jim? Probably ask Joe for a cut. Just Kidding! I don't think that I would do anything. I don't think that this is so egregious that I need to risk my financial comfort and my families stability for this. Seems sad, but then again what would you do in the Real World?
