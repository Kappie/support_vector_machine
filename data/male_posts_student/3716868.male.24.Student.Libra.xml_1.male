I did 36 minutes of CV and 3 sets of circuits, but no free weights or stomach exercises. Still, first day back! From now on, I'm going to note down the weights at the exercise stations to chart my progress (yes, this blog is a glorified exercise chart).  Starting Monday, I'm taking the South Beach diet. We have a little book on it at home. My sister and mum are on it at the moment, so that should make it a bit easier. The worst part is the first 2-3 weeks where you can't have any fruit (even juice), bread and dairy products. Besides sweets and chocolate, these are among my favourite foods! I think chicken and fish are allowed but I'll find out. I'm going to draw up a weekly eating plan for the week, buy in the groceries at the weekend, and start on Monday.
