She upsets me with the contradicting acts she puts forth, She's antagonizing me! I was so very upset when we broke up; I held all of the morbid emotion in. Confining me to petulance. Her devotion to this Ill-fated charade constricts my patience. I thought I really got to know Shannon on the trip to King's Island, where I was brutally depressed, overcome with thoughts of fictitious complexities. I burrowed into a deep confined hole distributed in my soul, telling in specific detail how demented and destroyed my life has become and as well my feelings toward her. I felt this created a connection, finally a real conversation between the both of us. But, It was only a beneficiary mirage of hope. She told me that mystifying dark altered evening, that her feelings for Keith and I were distributed evenly accordingly to her passion. How could she like someone so raucous and repugnant? Frow what I heard, this malicious dependent of a person's mother evidently said that Shannon is putting her poor son through a life of dismay. F*%@$^ S*#$! If that kid is so stubborn and indulged upon himself and believes his life is so hard! F@%^ Him! Especially knowing the fact that he had to patsy Greg for his Espionage practiced upon I and Kelly's conversation on the long bus ride home. Shannon didn't even seem to to care when Marti told her. Her expression was quite pitiful, I was shocked. I thought Shannon was different; at least she knew better or asked him if that was true. I don't understand how you can like someone that cordially obliges himself to that certain extent. Although, I know she doesn't have feelings for me and you might ask how do I know for sure? Well if she did have feelings for me like she said, she wouldn't put me through this. She does more with Keith than I. Although I know for sure I care for her so much more than him. She won't even talk to me unless I start the conversation, nor look into my eyes when talking. She ignores me completely, changes the subject nontheless. But, when she is around Keith she would no doubtfully talk to him or massage his shoulders. . . So why does she play me so? She is playing me with a vengeance, passion, and creative configuration. I started to comtemplate these feelings, but I love her so much. I don't want to lose her, but she is screwing up royally. She doesn't disserve me (as so I'm told), and trust me I'm a pretty good guy. Unlike Keith and his outrageous temper of his. But, there is nothing I can do to make that change. That night when I saw them eloping in the hot tub together, unleashed the most massive of feelings possibe. God bless Melinda and Amber that night for comforting me, the sheaded tears for her probably meant nothing to Shannon. But, Iguess I'm the one being immature about the whole resolution. Maybe, I just think I have it so bad. Just because at age 6 my 5 yr old sister got hit by a bus, me being home from school sick could of died as well. . . I would have been right behind her. . Then shortly afterward my Grandfather committed suicide over the incident of my sister with a shotgun to the head. Then the next year I lost a cousin to a head on collision car accident. then the next year lost a cousin over a purely evil sickness called meningitis. Then the next year my friend died of cancer. Then the nnexy year my mother dies. . Someone you truly depend on, why my mother? Why!? Why does everyone I truly care about, always leave me. My mother was the coolest mother of all, she tought everything and how to just to have fun in life. She knew everything as well, she was my best friend, a person that was always there when I needed to talk to or cry on her shoulder. But, then one day she was gone. . . I've been to three different schools because of numerous reasons, been treated so harshly by everyone. It seems there is no care in the world, no one out there that loves me. Yeah I still have my dad, but he always has to fight with me every chance he's got. He doesn't come to my games, meets, and concerts. He doesn't support anything I do. But, there are my brothers that are the biggest aspirations in my life. Dustin 21, The Intellegent Work Ethic and Derek 19, The Intelligent Athletic. Both are really cool people and get me through my life. Mostly everyone at Decatur treats me with hostility and disrespect. I always get slandered or falsely accused by everyone all the time. I don't know why my life is so cursed, I was just one kid caught in a domino effect that affected my life tremendously but, I guess I'm wrong. What do you think?
