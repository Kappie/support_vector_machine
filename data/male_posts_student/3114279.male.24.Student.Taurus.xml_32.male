      Well, Glenn's list is pretty impressive, sorta hip (lowercase h : not as hip as I figured), even if it does make him seem like a 60 year old.  Most of them I can agree with, though I hate Singin' in the Rain, and I could barely get through 2001; I could feel myself aging as I tried to sit still and watch the movie (read: boring).  I usually personally rate movies based on how they make me feel, and how I relate to them;  I guess I'm not as interested in cinema as I am feeling and thinking.  Lawrence of Arabia is completely magnificent to watch, but there is not a thing that I can relate to in that film;  Roder Dodger looks like it was just shot by a couple of guys with video cameras following people around, and it probably was, but it rings true with me.  I would also say that my favorite movies are ones I can watch over and over and over; rewatchability.  Between the two of us, we have some taste.  I'm surprised Once Upon a Time in the West and Wrath of Kahn were not in the top ten.  Also surprised that Howard the Duck or Battlefield: Earth didn't make the cut.
