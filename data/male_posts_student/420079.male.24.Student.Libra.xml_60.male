A week-long flurry of letters led to a real live date, and finally, FINALLY, there was real chemistry. I like her. A lot. At times I feel intoxicated around her, and I close my eyes and hold her close and just savor the feeling of being there with her. She is beautiful and precious and cute and funny and delightful and delicious and she is my baby.  She is laying in my bed right now, sleeping, and I am looking at her. And I feel fuzzy and warm inside. And it is very nice.
