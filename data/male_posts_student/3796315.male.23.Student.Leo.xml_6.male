There is an AI assignment due next week, I am going to spend a lot of time on that.  Well, saw some of the photos that my fellow coursemate, Derrick posted online. He went to France for exchange program. The scenery there is so beautiful. Contacted Saekiat. He went to Lulea, Sweden. Stuff over in Sweden cost a lot ya.  Anyway, attended 1st Latin dance class at UQ today. Had fun learning the dance steps. Did some practice with Serene and Michelle, and they are better than I. Have to practice more often in front of the mirror, ha. Dominic is asking if i want to learn golf. Am interested but I got assignments coming up. Hmm, still thinking, may be going since it's once per week.   Serene's going back to Singapore at the end of the month. She has decided not to apply for PR. Will be having a farewell dinner for her soon.  Made soy milk today, was supposed to put in a bit of ginger to remove the beany taste. But i had put in too much and the milk taste gingery. Haha. Don't think will make any more because it's quite troublesome.  ALrighy, getting late soon, got to go. Wish all is well at back home. Ciaoz/
