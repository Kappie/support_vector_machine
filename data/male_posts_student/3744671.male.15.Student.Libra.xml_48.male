And you can fully customize any model on their website (which can be reached via the link provided).  The only bad part about these machine is the price point, especially when you get into customized machines, the price point can get very steep! However, these are definitely the coolest looking PC's on Earth!  I was messing around and customizing an Aurora Desktop PC (which is Alienware's AMD computer, BTW) and here are some pretty crazy specs I got, with an even crazier price!
