Yup....fetal pig dissection day could not have been better lol. My group consisted of Ben, Melissa and Robert, but for some reason they wanted me to do most of the dissecting. So being me, I had the honours of doing the first cut ^_^ and afterwards Ben would help out a lot actually. But yeah....this is really making me want to be a surgeon...or something of that sort =P.  Before that though....starting with the top of my day....and slowly winding down to the end...  Morning went by as any other usual morning, except no senior band today =P.  Music was first class of the day. Sadly we don't have Mrs. Wharton once again as she has to go into surgery to repair a Hernia or somethin, so we are stuck yet with another sub teacher. Don't know his name yet, but he's missing two front teeth it looked like. Anyways today's music class sucked....we did scales major and minor, and since I already know all of them from top to bottom.....ugh it was lame. He said he wouldn't teach us any way new to learn the sharps and flats, but in the end he did anyways....what a waste of time. So helped Niki with her stuff, since she seemed to not get this...nor did I understand this teacher's system of remembering stuff. Anyways didn't like the teacher much....sub teachers are pretty lame.  And onto science class. Did some stupid assignment which I have to finish tomorrow.  Lunch....went to Galleria....had a sub, then walked back to school  Bio.....like I said before was fun. Pig dissection was very amusing, though the preservatives did smell. Also Robert was being a retard trying to open the pig's mouth and eyes...though it's dead. I had my share of the fun cutting up the pig, and cracking the rib cage. That's gotta be the worst part about dissecting. The point where you have to take a pair of scissors, and then break through the ribcage by splitting it right down the middle....yeah that was pretty gruesome. Or the first time you open up the pig...and bile spews out...yeah I was kinda surprised that happened since well...usually dissections for schools don't have juices coming out of it. But after that one scare nothing else really happened that scared me. Other gruesome part had to be seperating the cage from the muscles and tendons keeping it stuck to the organs and skin. Ben got to cut that while I had to hold it....yeah dissecting is fun. I can't wait until next year =)....gr. 12 I heard you get to cut up a full sheep.  English class we started watching FGT movie. Not amusing...the movie really sucks personally I think because they leave out so much stuff. So that was the basic outline of english class. Not much work as we are nearing end of the year.  Bused home with Dan and Elaina, and then walked home through the tracks and got home around.....330ish? From then until 730 basically I slept....originally I was gonna go work out with Marcello but he's still kinda sick so I just decided to nap instead.  *4 hours later*  Woke up, ate, played some ball at Paul's old place and then SCed for a bit. Math h/w's done, and I'm gonna now shower and head to sleep. Got band still tomorrow. Later.
