Maybe if we discover your hidden Buffy identity you could join.  As of now, I'm setting up a website. Pictures are first on the agenda. I have a set prepared for those I imagine will join and a few more for kicks. Here is a sample.     If you have a specific picture you want to use of your character, tell me. Jian has already rejected mine, and I'm no offended! So feel free to reject reject reject!
