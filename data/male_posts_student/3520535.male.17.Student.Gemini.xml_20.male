I walk in with a rifle above my head and shout, "The rebels have taken the capitol city!" Noah is sitting on the toilet. He screams, "Ahhh! I'm naked!" True to his word, he isn't wearing anything, and doubles over to avoid exposing himself. I say, "Well, here's your toilet paper," and I toss it to him and leave.
