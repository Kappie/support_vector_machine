He said the only reason the war was happening was for a pipeline. To this day a pipeline benfiting the United States has not been built. Want proof? If a pipeline had been built my parents wouldn't still be paying 2.50 for gas. Second, he thinks that his opinion is the right one which is entirely not true. He thinks he, a director with little education in politics or the economy, knows more than the entire Bush Administration, which is a group of men and women that have earned degrees from greatly respected colleges and universities, and are experts in what they are doing. Finally, he says he does not feel any safer now than he did before the war. How could this be true when the United States Armed forces have killed tens of thousands of terrorists, and wounded and captured many many more. And in fact terrorist attacks have dropped from nearly 400 when Bush came to office, to just half that amount last year.  Next topic, the economy. Democrats have attacked Bush and claimed that he has damaged the economy beyond repair. How can this be true when all the economic problems started in Clinton's last month in office. Bush inherited a horrible economic situation and fixed it as best any president would be able to.  Sorry about this, I just needed a place to rant and rave, and I thought this was a good place. These are just my judgements. You should not blindly believe everthing you see or hear. Always research the subject, get both points of view and then make a decision. Dindn't expect to hear this much about politics from a fourteen year old did you?
