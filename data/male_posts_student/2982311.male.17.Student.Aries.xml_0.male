Alone for a while I've been searching through the dark, For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart. To weave by picking up the pieces that remain, Melodies of life - love's lost refrain.  Our paths they did cross, though I cannot say just why. We met, we laughed, we held on fast, and then we said goodbye. And who'll hear the echoes of stories never told? Let them ring outloud till they unfold.  In my dearest memories, I see you reaching out to me. Though you're gone, I still believe that you can call out my name.  A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of Life, To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and beyond.  So far and away, see the bird as it flies by. Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up in the sky. I've laid my memories and dreams upon those wings. Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings.  In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me? Was it fate that brought us closer and now leaves me behind?  A voice from the past, joining yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life, To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and on.  If I should leave this lonely world behind, Your voice will still remember our melody. Now I know we'll carry on. Melodies of Life, Come circle round and grow deep in our hearts, as long as we remember
