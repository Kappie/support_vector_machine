School was pretty boring and lunch was actually kinda bad just because they didn't end up going to Subway but Tyke ended up going there for dinner so it turned out alright.  Well after school Tyke went home for about an hour.  That was fine as he just ate some and then he went over to Purdy's house.  He tried on a suit that her grandfather wore and it was weird.  It was a hella tight suit but the pants were much too short (which made them look cool) and then the waist was so big that it fell off of Tyke's waist and down his legs (but don't forget that Tyke is insanely skinny).  So then Ekul came over and they hung out for a few minutes before going out to Redmond for some shopping.  Purdy drove but Tyke pulled the old 4-5 move (ya know how there's a 1-2? well this is the 4-5) with Tyke driving from the passenger seat.  Purdy seemed to enjoy at times not having to drive other than the gas/brake.  It's tough to drive a long way from the passenger side though.  But it's still fun.  They first went to Value Village and Tyke and Ekul were in heaven.  There was just so much sick stuff there.  Like Tyke probably should have just bought a bunch of things to wear to school from there.  Damn, he wishes he did now.  Maybe tomorrow he will though.  Purdy had to keep the guys under control because there was so much cool stuff.  And there were these two costume coordinators or something like that there and they talked to Tyke and Ekul for a little as they looked at sweet hats.  After they went to Value Village they went over to another costume shop which was pretty cool.  Tyke and Ekul kept talking about what was back in the 1920s.  Like gorillas, and chain mail, and bunnies.  Pretty much everything.  But not buses.  Or were there?  Does anybody know if there were buses in the 1920s?  At first Tyke said there were but then he realized (with Purdy's aid) that there might not have been.  But anyway, Tyke would just like to have confirmation either way.  After the costume shop they went over to American Eagle and the Booty Patrol was there.  Then they went to Subway for dinner and then to Jet City at the school.  Jet City was quite funny as usual.  Tyke is not nearly good enough at improv to be able to do that.  He doesn't think he could keep coming up with new stuff all the time.  But he likes doing it.  So Tyke's main quest now is to find a really good Tolo outfit for the 1920s.  That should be fun.  And a hat is necessary.  Hey, this blog really doesn't quantify the amount of fun Tyke had today.  But it would be pretty hard to do.  Grrrr...there is so much Tyke wants to say right now.  But nobody to tell it to.  There's just a lot of stuff Tyke wants to get off his chest and pretty much whine about.  It's just he can't.  Well he can but he doesn't think he should.  Do you know what that's like?  It is really difficult to know something but just have to hold to it.  And what's worse is the fact that there is nothing that Tyke can do about it.  It isn't something that is fixable.  Arrrgghhh...Tyke's mom is home.  Maybe she knows of some things for his tolo outfit.  Bye bye.
