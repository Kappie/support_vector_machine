The future is coming for me, I must be ready and prepared. Whatever it has stored for me, I must face it without hesitation, Without any distraction. I must not waste my time -- -- -- -- Yet... -- -- -- -- I can't help but look at her, Her beauty, her friendship towards me, Her kindness, her... I tried to persuade myself that it was fake, I tried to persuade myself that she was just a heart ache. Yet I couldn't believe what I was saying... I frighteningly shivered at my cold thoughts... How could I have thought of her like that? She was never fake, she was real... She was my friend... She left... She is no longer here. Yet I can't let go of her in my memories, She is permanent, She is an engraving placed in my mind. She could never be erased. -- -- -- -- I couldn't stop shivering,  I kept on thinking about her. I fall to the floor, I couldn't get up. Here I was thinking that I was ready for my future, Yet I couldn't be any more wrong than I've ever been. I keep on looking back, The past keeps on disturbing me, The memories of her distract me, The mistakes I've made keep on reminding me, It was futile, I keep on looking back... To her, my past, my mistakes, everything... I am not ready... To let go of them. I am not able... To get rid of them. I am not ready...  For my future... Without them...  Constantly racing inside my mind.
