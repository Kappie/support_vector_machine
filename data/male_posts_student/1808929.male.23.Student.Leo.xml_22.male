Did you know that the kidneys are 1/200th of our body weight, yet they receive 25% of our overall cardiac output?  Today I got to talk with two old friends of mine. Will McKnight, a friend of mine from Krum, left a message on my phone yesterday and I got back with him today. I’ve known for quite some time that he has a house now in Fort Worth ever since he started work at Lockheed Martin, but I have just completely neglected to keep in touch with him. I called him back today and I think we might be watching some basketball, TV, etc. this weekend. I’ve been saying now for months that I need to hang around with non-medical students sometimes for my own sanity, yet I’ve somehow forgotten about a handful of people I know in Fort Worth, including Will and my cousin, Jeff.    I also heard from one of my old HS roommates, Jacob Schofield. He’s now in flight school at Corpus Christi and today he sent me some pictures he recently took of him flying. I can’t even fathom it, but Jacob is really going to be a pilot. I guess he’s already somewhat of a pilot if he’s flying certain planes around! Jacob is from Ponder, so he’s one of those TAMS people that I’m pretty sure I’ll be able to keep tabs on over the years.   That’s it. Have a good night.
