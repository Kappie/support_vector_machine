I am just listing all the shit I can't do most of the day...My dad is runnin the generator again just to cool everything in the fridge to make sure it doesn't spoil...then it has to go off...and my dad needs the phone line open now...so...I have to get off soon...*sighs* you kno how i took a shower today?  I filled the sink with cold water we are saving in the bathtub, got a wash cloth and washed myself like that...then rinsed with very cold water...why don't I skip a shower? because I haven't gone one day without taking a shower this summer...I have to take a shower...I just feel...dirty....if I don't....so yea...the world has seemed to stop...and once the generator goes off in a little bit...I will be back with no electricity in dullsville....cya later guys...and wish me luck on trying not to go insane....
