Sally was second and we had a quite good time, we played I Know Him So Well and then we just basically struck Chess. That was really cool. Thanks ever so much Sally for making me happier than I've been in a long time, I'm not kidding. You're cool. Marry me. Well, no, although that'd be cool.  Mocks have been going quite well, thanks. Yeah, not too bad. Maths was a pain in the arse, and I've got physics tomorrow, but it should be OK. I was thinking about Sally all the way through the French reading test today though, so I might not have done too well. But I don't mind. I like thinking about Sally. I'm a little worried that Rachel won't want to continue to do I Know Him So Well as she did seem to get a bit frustrated. Hm, I'm worried she doesn't like me. I don't mean like as in fancy, I mean like as in friendly. She's nice.  Yeah. I'd say I was in love with Sally, but I'm not, so I won't. But I'm comfortable around her. That is incredibly unusual for me.  Anyway, found out Caroline's last name, then proceeded to forget it. How clever am I?  I didn't get into the last round of the GYM, to be honest I'm not surprised. I wasn't going into it to win. I was going in it to prove to myself that I'd try. And I did. And I kicked arse with the Rimsky. Not enough to win, but I kicked arse. Seriously.
