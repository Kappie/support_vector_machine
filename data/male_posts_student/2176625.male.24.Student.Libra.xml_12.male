I have a hunch she is really coming to convince me that I need Leslie and can't live with out her. On the phone she said 'Nobody would make are more beautiful bride then Leslie. Talk to her, you will see how much you are meant to be together.'  I'll be frank, my family was in love with the idea of Leslie becoming part of our family. They adored her because she was smart, classy, and beautiful.  My own mother took her out looking for wedding dresses the day after we were engaged. My mother flew out to NY just to take my fiancee dress shopping! After she heard the news she jumped on the first plane she could catch, not to see me, but to see Les and to see the ring. That was 2 years ago.  Nobody in my family thought I would settle down. I proposed to her to prove my family wrong. I loved Les, not enough to marry her, but I thought it was the best thing to do. I loved her, my family loved her, my family loved her family, her family loved my family.   While I was living at home I can't even count the times my parents saw me with a different girl.  My mom has walked in on me having sex with different girls more times then I know. Then there was the time she walked in on a 3-some. She made me go to church and to temple everyday that year because I was 'unclean'. Fuck I was already unclean by that time and I was 15. I was raised both Jewish and Catholic so I have gone to church/temple more times then anyone I know. My Grandpa is a deacon and we had to go to two masses every Saturday night, two the next day then temple. I know the bible inside and out. My mom thought church was punishment but she was wrong because half the girls I brought home were from church.   They are sending my grandmother because they have the fear that without Leslie I will turn into Roderick they knew 4 years ago; trying to bed every girl in America and the one who will never settle down. If they only knew.  Les did not change me. I changed because there was something about being with ONE PERSON. I wouldn't go back to being the person my family and old friends knew for anything. I will have to convince my grandma of that so she will pack up her bags sooner then in 3 days.
