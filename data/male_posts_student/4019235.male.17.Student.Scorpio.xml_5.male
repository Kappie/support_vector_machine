And all that is in my mind now is how to make this the best blog I can make. And partly also to keep it running. So what do people do on their blogs? People talk about their life, the people around them, the shit they are in, and how screwed they are gonna be come next week or whenever. Its hardly an exciting thing for me actually, at least not yet. But as I continually get accustomed to posting and providing fresh contents, this place would work like a diary (That sounds so wrong, almost sissy-like). It’s like how the psychiatrists say, getting it out keeps   ur   sanity in. It is so especially true in my circumstance right now. But that is for later, now, I’m busy searching through the myriads of data in my mind for the specific emotion that comes with the creation of my first ever blog post and the responsibility to keep it running. Gosh, it’s a lot. Any way, this is written on the 24 th  of July of 2004, a period of time in which it’s halfway to the Preliminary Exams from the June holidays. This timeless period is best described as the “there is a bloody impt exam and I’m f*cking not care” period.         Oh and I must mention “This blog contains some bad words”.          The reason I use such unsavory language is because this blog involves unsavory contents based on unsavory experiences with unsavory characters.        I repeat, “This blog contains some bad words”.          No, the "unsavory" part does not involve porn or violence, but more subtle contents. At this point in time I don’t know what yet. But it’s definately not porn and violence. Maybe a little violence. Some harmless ones perhaps. It takes all sorts to make the world, so don’t ask.
