Second game was REALLY close, except me and Josh eventually lost to Gavin in an intense one point grab. Tied 14-14, me and Josh lost serve, and was back to Gavin's side who was w/ Jeffany's dad on a team. Jeffany's dad cleared the shot...and it was over. I was going to try to reach it but it was to high, and ducked for Josh to clear. No shot came, and the final score stood at 15-14. SO CLOSE...oh well at least it was good times. Saw Pow Pow, Hermann *who has a shinin' new raquet imported from HK* and Po-Kan also. We just kinda rallied for 40 minutes on a court. Didn't really play a game. But yeah first time at Westview in ages and last for the summer, as they close down for the summer season. Oh well, back to UCC it is...  For the rest of my day, I woke up at 1030 today, and did my daily devos. Today I read 2 Corinthians 5, mostly focusing on verses 11-21, about the "Ministry of Reconciliation," and how God reconciled himself through Christ. At first while reading verse 21, I didn't really understand it, but eventually I got it after reading it over many times, and finally understood that the "him" in the sentence is referred to Christ, who was perfect in all ways to be our living sacrifice, so that we might "become the righteousness of God." The verse actually reads this:  "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." -2 Corinthians 5:21  That verse really made me think about how much God loved us to sacrifice his own son for us, even though we have rebuked him so much. To think that God has endured through this for over 2000 years, and many of the people around me whine and complain about their lives being all crummy because apparently "no one there for them" *Even though God is right beside them* and their issues have been going on for maybe like what? 2 months? God has been havin' this stuff thrown at him for 2000 years, and Job even had bad times thrown at him for 70 years, and he STILL loved our Heavenly Father. If people asked for God's help through many things in life, most likely they wouldn't whine about the crapiness of it as much. Why must there be such an opaque wall set up by Satan around so many people's eyes? It's as though Satan has put a blindfold over many of us. If only people would just ask for God to remove it, and not lose all hope and begin to whine.  ...Well after morning devos, I went downstairs for some lunch. Afterwards, I basically photoshopped, coded, drummed, PS2'd, MSN'd, and ran around for a bit outside. That was the main outline of my afternoon in no particular order. Afterwards though, @ 7pm I went to Westview for some baddy, which as mentioned already I had a losing record, but it was still good times.  At Westview, Gavin kinda had a hard night with his badminton skills, and Josh was PURE clutch in our game, with me adding some luck haha, but still losing in an tight game of 15-14. Also got to chat with Josh about starting a Men's prayer group at LCAC, and also about the trip to Canada's Wonderland. Hope that thing will work.  Anyways, yeah here I am now blogging. I think I'm going to go watch Leno now though. And then sleep.  Until tomorrow..  Later.
