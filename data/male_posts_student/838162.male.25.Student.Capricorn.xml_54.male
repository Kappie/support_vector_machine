The Jedi gif is cute, but gets old after awhile, I should start looking for others. But it does pave the way for real pics coming to this blog soon. My family will be acquiring a digital camera within this month or early next and I'll make sure to have a go at learning and using it. Of course it will be a family item and not a personal one, so it's not a model that I would have chose (I.E. it's not a Sony) and I will not have access to it all the time. But on the other hand, it will fall under family expenses and not my own so that’s good. *grins*  Other plans for the blog, is to expand it into a real website. Start of with adding pages that have the same theme as the blog but contain other information such as a real bio page and full links page. If I really get ambitious (or finally get off my lazy ass), I might put up some of my own written works, stuff like reviews (movies, TV and a whole range of stuff) and short stories (mostly Fan Fics). Watch for it. I hope.    >   A bit under the weather over this weekend, have a sore throat, cough and some major headache. Think I caught it from Nigel, he's been sick earlier this week with the same symptoms. Kinda reminds me of my army days where when someone in the bunk gets sick and all the rest one by one catch it as well. Terrible.  Guess I'll just take it easy, do my readings and messing with my stuff. Like for example, I just got a new 128MB Memory Stick for my Clie, think I shall go find stuff to upload to it, maybe a dictionary (to help my spelling), a new e-book and even some MP3s. Of course once I move some of the big files on the Clie there will be more space to install new programs, so I guess I'll go look for some of those as well. Yay! Wee! *laughs*   Neat. I feel better already.
