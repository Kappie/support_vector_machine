School was mostly taken by Tyke's physics labs.  But both the individual and group labs got done 5th period.  "Well before they were due" as his dad said about them being due 6th period.  And they are both decent so hopefully everything will be good enough to help out Tyke's waning grade.  Who knows in that class.  Well, Tyke got home and pretty much just got to working on his new mixes.  He downloaded 33 songs and added another .1 GB of music to the hard drive.  There is now 3.14 GB of music on the computer upstairs.  And it is good shit too.  The theme to this mix is the 1970s.  It all started when on Sunday Tyke saw an infomercial about this Time Life collection of the hits of the 70s.  Tyke just copied down the titles to songs that were shown on there that he liked and then he made a nice long list.  After school Tyke just started dling them and thought of some other good ones too.  But all in all he downloaded 33 songs for his 2 cd mix.  76 minutes of music on the first CD and 74 on the second.  18 songs on the first, 15 on the second.  It is a fun mix to listen to.  Dr. Phil most likely won't like many songs but Amed and Kinker should.  Amed will like many and Tyke believes that Kinker should like a lot of them because he has a pretty good taste in music.  As does Amed.  The cds were finally done about 6ish and Tyke then listened to them for a little before settling down for dinner.  His brother had come home for the night as he is leaving tomorrow morning for D.C. to look at some of his options for law school and also to go back to see some of the touristy stuff there.  He hasn't been there since Tyke's family went the summer after 7th grade.  It was a good trip.  Tyke's bro isn't going to Georgetown but he doesn't know about like George Washington yet.  Tyke had some good lasagna for dinner but he didn't like the spinach ravioli.  Tyke doesn't like spinach so the normally good item of ravioli was spoiled by the normally bad item of spinach.  And since Tyke's bro drove himself home but is going to be gone all week Tyke gets to take his car.  So he will be driving the other Volv tomms.  It will be fun.  Exciting even.  Later on after dinner Tyke and his bro played ESPN for a while.  It was quite fun.  They listened to Tyke's mixes as well.  Time just flew and it was 9 by the time they quit.  Then Tyke ate some more and now has blogged.  It is nice not having to do homework again.  That one day of it was hell.  Just plain hell.  Tyke did his laundry today as well so he has a bunch of clean clothes to wear, mainly boxers and socks so that makes Tyke in a better mood as well.  So tomorrow Tyke will be driving a nice car and maybe doing some Tolo shopping/looking.  He sorta needs to as ya know, it's in 4 days.  No hurry though.  He just needs it by like what, 4ish?  Heh, first time Tyke trekked to Tolo.  Total alliteration.
