To quote from a Slipknot song "I never wanted anybody more, than I wanted you." It explains how I feel about you. I want to spend every waking moment I have with you. You helped me be calm and peaceful Saturday. I want to be like that more. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I can't stop thinking about you. It's like I'm stuck in a dream or a fantasy..................But if it is a dream, I never want to wake up from it. I treasure every moment I spend or talk to you as if it would be my last. I love and hate this feeling of not knowing when I'm going to be able to see you again. I want to see you again.
