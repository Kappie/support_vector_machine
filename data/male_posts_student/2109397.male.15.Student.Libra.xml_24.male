It asked us to name 4 functions and give an example. So I did and I ended up with like 6 sentences. I did what it told me to do, there is no use for SRE in that thing because it doesnt apply to the directions. Yet our teacher makes us fill out one of the charts. When I turned in my paper she goes you didnt tell me much and I was like I did what it told me. On the fucking pointless ass CATS test that probably woulda gotten a 4 but im gonna get 10 points out of 40 (a 1) because she doesnt know what the fuck she is doing.  Although everyone else in my class manged to write paragraphs, it still doesnt matter I follwed the fucking directions. SO BLAM MOTHER FUCKER!  That whole story wasnt really that big of a deal but I thought i would rant about it anyways and make it seem like it was.
