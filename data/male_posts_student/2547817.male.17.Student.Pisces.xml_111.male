I just don't fit with my class, hopefully I'll fit with my CCA.  2) I screwed up by getting into a fight with a boy (I wonder who) and the second top point of authority there. (gee)  3) I screw up things with a lady who could have been a very good friend.  4) I screwed up my UWC scholarship thing. Today I was told by a source that I was a prime candidate who some of the interviewers would have very much liked to have given me the scholarship, and were very sad when they couldn't, coz I wasn't at peak performance that day.  I'm so messed up, I feel like swearing. So many lost opportunities to make something great out of my life. I want to curl up in a corner and sob over spilt milk. It helps.
