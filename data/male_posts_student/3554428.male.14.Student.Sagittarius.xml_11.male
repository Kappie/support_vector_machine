But judges hit there gravels smashing hearts.   This sun. Never shining. But the rays still seem to burn deep. Flowers turn dead with peddels blowing through toxic air.  Rooms with white walls is a highlight of false hope. You slide notes underdoors. You say anomunus. But marked tears reveal its you. Those black tears.  We hear faint cries of men. Hearts demolisged. Cries not answered. But in all shame we find reflections in these hatred puddles....   This sun. Never shining. But the rays still seem to burn deep. Flowers turn dead with peddels blowing through toxic air.
