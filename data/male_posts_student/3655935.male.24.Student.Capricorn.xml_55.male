Since I’ve had some experience teaching and preaching in front of people, I’m not really bothered by the public speaking aspect of this assignment.  What has me hung up is finding a topic I enjoy, and can be covered in five minutes.  Here’s what I have so far.  My current plan is to teach  urlLink the logical problem of evil .  Several people have told me that this is not a good idea.  It may be too academic, and the employers may think I am some kind of religious fundamentalist.  What else can I do?  Here’s my backup plan.  Why not give a five-minute speech entitled "What I do to people who don’t hire me"?  I would go on for five minutes giving detailed descriptions of how I would key their cars, stalk their families, and burn down their homes.  I see only two possible outcomes: (1) They laugh at it, and hire me, or (2) They are scared to death and hire me.  If they decide to pass me on the position, at least I can tell the police I warned them. . .  If you have any better ideas, I’m all ears.   Disclaimer: Johnny-Dee would   never   commit acts of violence, arson, and terror against anyone solely because they didn’t hire him for a job.  The above story is a fanciful humorous bit with no serious intentions. Also, this is the end of this post, but I can't get the "read more" link to disappear.
