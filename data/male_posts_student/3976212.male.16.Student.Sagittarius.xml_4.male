I easily could settle for the 400 watt system for $300. I was also looking up the computer speakers (logitech) and they go for 300-500. The wattage for the $300 one is 280. The $500 (which is a little too high) is 500 watts. Aslong as it connects to my computer using the regular speaker wires and not having to split them (it gets distorted) then I would be totally happy. Now for the money--anyone?
