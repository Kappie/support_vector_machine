A guy at work told me tonight that I need to get a girlfriend. I wish it were that easy for me. Fuck, I can't even talk to most girls out there, let alone ask one out. Fuck, man. Talking to people makes me feel even worse sometimes. I've been talking to some of the girls I know about stuff that's been going on in our lives. I talked to one of my friends one night until early in the morning because she's been having a hard time with her ex, and I was up all night with her one time just talking. There's a lot of stuff that we talk about and I really wish I could help her more than I can. On another note, I've been talking to one of my close friends a lot and I can't think about anything but her sometimes. Why? On top of all the other shit in my life, I'm probably going to screw up one of the best relationships I've ever had by going crazy over a girl. Go me. On a lighter note, Pat is going to St. Paul's this summer to study Artificial Intelligence. I asked if that is just because he went there last year, or if it's another program altogether. If I can, I want to go next year. I was so bummed out because the didn't invite me for this year, and every time I talk to Steph or Pat they make me feel even worse because they both went last year. Hope I can go, though. That would kick some major portions of ass.
