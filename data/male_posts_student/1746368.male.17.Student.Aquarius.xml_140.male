I told her some of the classes I am taking next year and she told me that I would like them probably. She said she wants me in her journalism class 'cause I am so good at computers. *Ponders* maybe I will do that (whoa, I just took Melody's and Reeser's "Ponders"; *shutters* [Just kidding girls, I love you two!])  Biology: We dissected a rat. What else can I say? My hands still smell like Latex.  Lunch: We didn't go to the computer lab for once! Are you proud of me? It was closed actually. We kinda messed around, and Danny kept on spearing people with toothpicks. Pretty humurous. I need to get my own digital camera, just to take weird pictures of my lunch time. I think my readers would enjoy it after a while.  U.S. History: Well, what I was SUPPOSED to be doing was watching a movie and writing my comments. What I really did was talk with my friend about the dangers of getting intimate before a relationship. By intimate I do not mean sexual relations.   She likes a guy, who doesn't want to be in a relationship but they are at the stage of kissing, before they are going out. I told her to ask him out but (as some girls may know) the girl never asks the guy out. Trust me, the guy would much rather it be that way. You girls might get some brownie points for that.  Anyways. Erm. That's all folks.  "Coach Boone: Son, when I was 17 my dad died and I had 12 brothers and sisters to take care of. Now, I have faith in you and I know you can do this.  Sunshine: Right, I will do my best coach."  [later]  "Coach Tyrell: You had twelve brother's and sisters? Coach Boone: Eight. Coach Tyrell: You're right, twelve sounds better." --Remember the Titans (paraphrased greatly, I don't remember the quote and can't find it either)
