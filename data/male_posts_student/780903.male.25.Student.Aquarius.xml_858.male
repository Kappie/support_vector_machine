I don't know much But I know the case law And that may be All I need to know  Look at this rule It could not be complex-er The girl with a contract Can't tell if this affects her  I don't know much But I know the case law And hopefully It's all I need to know  [bridge] So many questions Still left unanswered So much The court did not decide And when I'm parsing clauses The pain that this code causes The thing I need to know is how This rule's applied  Look at that judge I trust he ruled it rightly So I read the cases And the code cites only slightly  I don't know much But I know the case law Wish that would be All I'd need to know, whoa…oh…oh…oh…ah…
