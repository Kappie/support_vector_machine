Life seems to pose the maximum amt of work just when u least want it... ...or perhaps we want the least whenever we get the maximum.. not quite sure of that,but whatever it may be,it's not very good.  I had finished matrices sort of yesterday but didnt do anything much after that!...and today when i am doing the miscellaneous problems,i realize that the properties of determinants are giving me some little problem...which ofcourse i will be sorting out just now.  I have just come back from the wall,after some exhausting(not literally,but whatever) tennis.I even cut my finger badly due to my metallic watch on my left hand while playing a double-hand backhand...But that's the fun about tennis...i love playing all the more when it's paining somewhere...it gives u some extra zeal.  Today,as usual was quite a sultry hot and humid day,in this great land of delhi belonging to this "great" nation INDIA.  I think there is also a indo-pak cricket match on today....not that i am interested,but i heard some score while coming back from the wall.(some noise was coming from KLS)  Also,my search for P-A hasn't led to any conclusions(simply because i have hardly searched!!!).  So i think i should go for a nice bath and then back to matrices!! AND BEST OF LUCK (to myself).  CHA_CHao. (bleh!)
