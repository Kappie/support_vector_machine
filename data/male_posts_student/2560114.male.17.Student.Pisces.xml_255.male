What increased the gayness was we had to run 40 linez cuz ppl dont know how to follow directionz, im not blamin anyone cuz we all did it and we're all dumbasses. Then 5th period we didnt do anything except play cardz and stuff, but i made my own yearbook, its bitchin. I say who needz to spend $60 on a yearbook when u can make ur own...haha. But yeah, i passed it around and almost everybody in the class signed it. 2nd period was pretty lame cuz we had to watch a borin ass movie. I learned that i needed 75/100 to get a B in that class, so i best get studyin and kick ass on the final. 1st period was gay aswell...i hate spanish...that sayz it all. My favorite comment on my yearbook belonged to stephanie, *to steph* no, i never get bored cuz im alwayz wit u...:D...hehe. so that was my day, hopefully tomorrow will pass by as quickly as possible. Not sure if im gonna go to practice cuz i need to start studyin inorder to maintain or get the grades that i want...payce outside.
