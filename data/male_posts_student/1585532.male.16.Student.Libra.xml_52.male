My life's kinda gone through some intersting-ness.  After being single for like....3 weeks..or maybe more, I didn't keep track...  Anyways, after being single for awhile, turns out someone likes me!  Woo!  I ask her out, and it's been a great relationship so far.  She's too perfect.  I swear, she's just too perfect.  So cute too.  ^_^  I get to see her this Thursday, which rocks amazingly hard.  I love her.   Haven't been to Knott's since Solace...and proud of it!  Solace left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth.  It wasn't anyones fault either..its just how everything kinda happened.  During the morning everything was great.  During the mid-day...ehh not bad.  The meet-ups I did were great, and the DDR meet was fun, but....meh.  Night-time just wasn't all that fun.  I ended up sitting in the bar with a few friends.  Doubt I'll be going to Knott's anytime soon either, especially with all these spring breakers about ::shudder::.  But that can always change....  Probably will end up going to Disneyland sometime soon though....Indy re-opens...which rocks.  First re-hab that thing got in 10 years...which is like...freakin amazing.  Mansion's second elevator returns, which equals increased capacity...thank freakin' god.  Meh, enough with the themepark stuff.  Anyways, yah....I'm taken again....its so great! ^_^  She's just about the greatest thing to happen to my life in like almost forever.    Anyways, history homework = suckiness....so....bye.
