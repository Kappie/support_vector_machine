Coburn Kong the new CSM was dam pissed off man at that time, as the Part A and B drills really suck and when i say suck i really mean sucks man, Coburn even threatened to take away their games time if their drill dosen't improve, that must have scared te shit out of the Part A's and B's ok some people might take me the medic as unimportant, but i tell you one thin at that training i showed how inportant i was, a lot of them had leg cram and i treated my casualties with a lot of care ok!!! i even went up to get beehoon and drink for him toe eat man, because there was free beehoon and i also wanted some, but that is not the point, treated him very good already ok!!!! also Our Log spec. i don't know how he sprain his ankle in the Log room ok, but i had to run and treat him and i even went and stayed in the room to look after him even though i wanted to slack in there, but again that was not the point, but the most worst of all injuries was when a Part A cut his to on the drain while he was playing soccer bare feet, i had to go treat it, the flesh of the bottom part of his toe was cut, it was still hanging there man, i checked my manual and this type of injury is called an avusion, a lot of people cannot stand me and the way i treat his toes, as i took water and wash his toes, then using some cotton biud i wipe of some of the blood, then i took the twizers and i unflap the piece of flesh, a lot of them seeing me could not stand it, they all looked at it and were dam disgusted i tell ya don't know what is so scared about it man all were just a bunch of soft people, i did that as i had to open it and clean it with water then kill the bacteria with a alcohol prep pad or i might have an infection. then after that i took the oxide spray and pray it on the unflap flesh in order to clog the blood then i put a plaster on him. that is why i am important, if i was not there nows what will happen to all these casualties, depend on colin chis, oh please!!!! at the end of the day i had a sense of satisfactory i had done my job!!!! ok so i went home feeling very tired, so i slept after my lunch until i had to go for cath. class, i was still dam tired, but i had no choice, so i went to cath. class and uncle james was back, the lesson was dam boring, but uncle james told us he was sufferring from some kind of dieseas, he never told us, it maybe could be cancer. ok so after cath. class, we went out to get a bus to my house, so it was sam, ade, justin, ben, gerard and tham followed, well ben's dad told us the fire station was on fire and it was pretty ironic man, i mean a FIRE STATION ON FIRE WHAT THE HELL MAN!!!!!! so we found out the road was closed and that no bus could access the road from st.mikes, so they had a idea that we walk to my house, but i warned them it was dam far, but they said never mind, i can tell you the fire station on fire incidenti tell ya pretty ironic as we had to walk pass it to get to my house and the road was really closed until i could walk in the middle of the road and no car will bang me, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!!!!!!!!! pretty ironic huh. So they finally arrived at my house and started raiding it, should have saw the reaction on my mothers face when i said the fire station was on fire hahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!! ok so all my friends eventually arrived, but both sides did not want to mix with each other, sam told me she was afraid of mixing because she was afraid they would think she was flirt????? but paul was dam shocked when he saw ade and sam, dunno why though?????? ok they enjoyed the food, but the best part i think eveyone enjoyed was when they grabbed me and threw me to the pool!!! but they threw me to the pool 2 times ok first was they grabbed me and threw me, the second time was when justin or ben push me in hahahahahaha!!!!! dam wet, then took pictures also another funny thing was when they were telling ghost stories,so i went to scare sam, she scream dam loud until i nearly deaf man, also she wanted to whack me 15 times!!!! god!!! dam pain, whack until dam hard man!!!! hahahahaha but i don't know why everybody say i am rich, i don't know why though everybody say i am rich when i am not!!!!! good god!!! so after the party i went to see everybody off and went to clear the place up before going back, shower then open my presents, thanking all the people who bought me a present!!!! so the next day i skip the GOH training, today well Koh Yew Kiat told us tommorrow he going reservist, YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so happy!!!! don't need to look at his face for 3 weeks!!!! ok today yoko ask me why me and sherman keep on fighting, i told him the reason, yoko heard it he dam angry man the main thing that pissed him off when i told him that sherman said that god and jesus did not exist so why waste our time going to church!!! wah i tell you a lot of people dam pissed when they heard that yoko told benedict, benedict was also not ahppy about it man, i tell ya sherman is near a thin red line in our class, he bigshotness and disrespectfulness for people is going to get him into trouble. ok ya know where i am typing me blog right now, not at home but at willy's house hahahahahaha, i don't know what happen to CJ, the last i heard she told me that she maybe had dengue fever, don't know whether she is in hospital right now, if she is, i am gonna pay her a visit, considering the fact that she will be dam bored in the hospital, if she ended up there hahahahahahahahaha, ok now i need to end here so bye then!!!
