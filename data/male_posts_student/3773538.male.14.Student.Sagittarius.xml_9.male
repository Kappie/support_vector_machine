Jia Hao, Kakeru, Yuzheng, Kit Yeng, Chin Kuan, and many others had volunteered themselves too to help out at the competition as judges, usherers and helpers. It was indeed an experience for all of us. Well, the bottomline was that we had to do a lot of walking around the hall. There was of course another reason why we were there. CIP. I also made a few sec 2 friends from school. It was indeed 'killing FOUR birds with one stone'. Firstly, I will get 5 hrs worth of CIP. Secondly, I met lotsa new friends. Thirdly, I received a souvenir from the organiser. It was, of course, a wonderful dice game worth $8. Last but not least, I got to socialise with friends like Kakeru and Kit Yeng, whom I don't usually talk much to in school. See how cool this decision was?
