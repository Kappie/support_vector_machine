Anyway, she precisely told me this:  "You know Julien, progress comes from America" ; meaning social, civil rights. At the time, she seemed to me to be rather in favor of same-sex marriage even though she's right-wing. I didn't really reply to her thought, but I thought it showed a clear misunderstanding of what America really is. It made me realize that people have this view of America that comes from Hollywood, or The Left (most of them at least).  People say  "progress" , I say  "evolution".  One has to make a difference between the two terms as Leo Strauss would stress,  progress really isn't necessarily progress   per se . If you look at the "advance" Europe has on social issues, it's stunning. Does it make the countries of Europe better? Absolutely not. I would tend to say it's the contrary.   One has to assess the various impacts that a change in policy has.  People have lots of ideas but no depth when it comes to explaining their so-called ideas.   Post-Scriptum:  No later than a week ago, Elise told me that she had a debate on gay marriage and she decided she didn't support it. I personally have still no position on this issue.
