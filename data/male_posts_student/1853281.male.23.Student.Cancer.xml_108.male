So.Did not go to work yesterday because i was ill...then ended up ending things with D., so now am single again. Still in shock from that. There had been some radical changes in the past two weeks that seemed to me to indicate a more secure and intense relationship. Apparantly just the opposite. So went to Lyles with J-dawg and A. and drank...it was two-for-ones-too. But in good news got my grades back, GPA is now officially up enough that i can go to grad school. Hooray. But in bad news, Homosexual men can no longer donate sperm in the U.S. supposedly because of H.I.V. which is ridiculous as there are now reliable and fast test, and HIV is not limited to the queer community. Sheer predjudice. They don't want us breeding. Period. Grrrr. Not that i want to breed. You all know how i feel about children, and especially the subject of me as parent. Will be gone this weekend in the wilds of Wisconsin with my mums. anyways off to brood on dumb stupid men and sigh as i read magnetic fiels 69 love songs lyrics over and over.
