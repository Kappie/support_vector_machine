There’s no doubt that it is in the exact same spot, so unless we have some spiders that are obsessive compulsive, I don’t think that it’s a spider bite.  So mum took me to the doctor to get it checked out. Seriously, I am so sick of going to that place. It’s headaches, it’s my weight, it’s my back, it’s my allergies, it’s blah blah blah blah. My regular doctor wasn’t there so I got to meet with this really cool Jewish guy. Dr... Brody, I think. He looked at it and didn’t know what it was. So he went and got another doctor to get a second opinion. The reason they thought it wasn’t a spider bite was because it didn’t hurt or itch at all, it showed up in the exact same spot twice, and the way it felt wasn’t like normal bites. So I never really got a clear answer on what it was. But he thought there was some kind of fluid inside it so he cut it open to drain it. It’s really icky.  So that was... what? Wednesday? Yes. The discoloration is still there, but it isn't swelled up or anything. If it comes back, I swear to God, I'm going to do something. Yeah, I'll do something. I know what you're saying. "Oh, he's lazy. He won't do anything." But if you think that, you'll be wrong. Because I....  Jesus, I'm glad I stopped myself on that one. I had about three more paragraphs worth of the rambles.  I saw The Village. I don't get why everybody hates it. I mean, yes, it wasn't that scary. Perhaps overall the trailers for the film were scarier than the movie itself, which was misleading to some. But I loved it. I loved it just as much as The Sixth Sense, and Signs, and most of all, Unbreakable. Unbreakable is my favorite M. Night movie, even though it wasn't scary at all. I love it because it's a great story. It's fiction, but it's presented in a realistic fashion. The directing was trés chouette. That's what The Village was. There were a couple parts in the movie that made me think the ending was going to be horrible, but that went away when the ending finally came. And all the questions and disagreements I had with the story were answered at the end.  But it was good. I say it was good, and so it is. Why didn't you guys like it? (Answers would be very nice.)  "Sometimes we stop doing things we want to do so other people won't know that we want to do them. "  EDIT: I'm done with that crap.  I'm really proud of the picture I drew in class yesterday.
