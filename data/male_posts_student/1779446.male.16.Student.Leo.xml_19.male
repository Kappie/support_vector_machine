I'm going to have to play Kings Of Chaos! It's funny how ironic life is. I promised that I would play KoC if I got over 80 percent in my Maths test, which I was not expecting, but yet now I have to play a game I don't really want to play! I could have at least beaten my 80 by six or seven, but noooo, I just HAD to beat it by just one, a mere one! Well, at least I can say now is that I managed to mainuplate God, wait I shouldn't say that! Naughty me. Next time I should place a twenty dollar bet on me getting more than 90 percent. ;)  Colin Zhu, infidel extraoridinaire, going out with a naive, young girl who is in one grade lower than him at the local comphrehensive, who has ADD (an attention disorder) yet flirting with some other girls at school. Talk about despotic, heartless and screwed up. The only thing that'll be bigger than his ego is the crap pile he has backed himself into. I feel so tempted to call up my friend Jason to screw him over by telling Nicole (the girl) about his infidelity and the personal and embarassing stories he told us about her.  It is also funny, the amount of shit heads going around with single playing cards in their hands, trying to perfect sleigh of hand and card flourishes. It's sad, I mean, it's understandable if you do it at home, but doing it at school takes the word sad and depraved to whole new levels. When I actually try to do them a favour by saying "it looks sad and lame and people might think you are stupid". I get a reply saying "Shut up, you're gay Colin". Dudes if I was a gay, his pants would have been pulled down to his eczema infested ankles and I would be ass raping him so damn hard blood would be splurting out of his mouth.  Now, on a lighter note however, I completed my english competition and I'm also trying out to become MC for this years formal. Wish me luck! Sigining off....  Colin
