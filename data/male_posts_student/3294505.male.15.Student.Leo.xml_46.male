I'd be much happier if I didn't feel this way so frequently. It sucks.  And to think, I can't even say what I have to say exactly, because people are starting to read this again.  The irony.  Oh well. Shit happens, I suppose.   Even if I found someone to live for, I'd still be separated from them.. How unfair...
