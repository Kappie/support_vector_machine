But I'm home now, and it feels good to be home. My parents remodeled my room while I was gone, and I like it... but for some reason, I don't like the idea of my parents going through everything in my room. I don't have anything to hide really, it's just the idea of someone being in my space. I don't even like to leave the door open when I'm not home.  I don't anyone will get the "Return of the Jedi" pun. But I'm tired, which explains the both the pun and why I'm not writing any more.
