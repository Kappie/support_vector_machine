I took a swim around the afternoon, it was really relaxing, and not to forget, uber tiring too. Just finished yet another steamboat, boy im stuffed. It really seems like sheze drifting away...have u ever felt that you were quite close to something that u want to achieve, and it just collaspes? So bored, what should i do now? Maybe i'll go for a little walk or cycle, to let it all out. Hope i'll feel better. Damn it wheres my MD when i need it.
