Nah, I love myself (not just make love to myself, jackass). Hmmmmm, maybe I have low body-image. Hah, I am tall (shut up, it was funny). Maybe it is another psycological self-analysis (you can't spell self-analysis without anal! [and you can't spell funeral without fun!]) Maybe it is because I have to get my hair cut and shave. Hey! That could be it. I haven't liked getting my hair cut since i was a little kid. I used to cry and cry. I didn't like the idea of a stranger being paid to use scissors that close to my head, and neck for that matter (which reminds me, my parents hate me, but that is beside the topic!). I also don't liek shaving. I have imaginged the headlines since I was 14, "14 year old cuts own neck while shaving, prefers death-bleed to embarrasment". lol, I got to say death-bleed (how many hyphens is that?). While i have never actually cut myself shaving, even tho I used to use cheap single blade razors with no foam, I still don't liek it. Maybe unkempt is now a look, w/e. Story time. My mom still thinks I am a kid. But then I guess i am still as naive for trusting her, but neway, here goes: cuppla weeks ago, she says to me:   "hey, Miiiiikeey?"   I say: "Don't call me mikey, asshole. (okok, I sed cocksucker, happy?)"  She says "wanna go to that game place that you spent way too much time in that one day?"  I say "huh?"  She says "I gotta get the fuck outta here, now let's go, and were stopping for coffee."  "werks fer me." (I say that alot.)  So I get into the car, and we go, with the A/C way too cold and the oldies on. I think "It's those hormones she's taking, they've put her back on her cycle again, and it is irregular, so i can't keep track nemore." (I read way too much into shit sometimes.). We go to Highland Plaza. We park in a crappy spot (Both of my parents always park in crappy spots, so they can find the car easier, my mom b/c she is forgetful, and my dad b/c he is old [I love saying that]). She gets out of the car quickly, this makes me wonder, as my mom is large and does not move quickly anywhere. She makes a beeline for the store next to the GameStop. You know. The hair cuttery (nonono, you don't get caps [BAD hair cuttery, BAD]). She opens the door, and detecting my imminent resistence, she yells "Get in here!". I look at her liek WTF? She says "GREEEEEEEEAAAIIIGHH!". So I, detecting her imminent scene, and blaming me for the looks everyone will give her until she leaves, make an identical beeline for said door. Hair gets cut. Electromechanial cutting device is pressed against my neck. It jams, pulling out hair and making me go "SSSSHHHHHIT!". My mothere hears it. I could just hear hear smile. It sounded like something between two baloons rubbing against each other and a door creaking. Even better, it sounded liek an old barbie doll's legs when they are moved very quickly. Did I mention mom is getting old, too? Nvm. Whatsername is tipped well for her follicle abuse. I, and here is the naive part, decide to walk next door, where the GameStop is, to look for Zelda (NES). I found out on a later day that not only did they not have Zelda, but that they do not carry NES games at all. Oh well, I wouldn't have finished it anyway. I already got it for game boy advance. Back to story. She goes "NNNNNNO!", grabs me, and takes me back to the car (long walk). I comply, confused by my all-to-apparent naivete. She starts the car and pops it into reverse. As we start to pull away, I say timidly "hey, ma??" (pause) "ma". "Whadda YOU want?" she says. "Fuck you." I reply, more forcefully. (this reads liek a chilren's book, it does" Now, you might say that this is a rather harsh thing to say to your mother. I agree. The thing is that I knew she was going to be mad at me, sooner or later, that is how she gets. So i decided I rather say "Fuck you." and know when she going to be mad, than sit in the car while she drives agressively and risks my life. So I prompt her, and I am prepared for the fight that would have been a surprise later in the drive. Anywho, we drive. She argues and tell her she is not fit to drive. We stop for coffee at starbucks. I had a vanilla frapachino, she opted for chocolate. (when she is in that mood, she opts, liek a movie star, she doesn't choose, liek a common person.) We drove home. The argument ends before she turns off of Kennedy, to go home. We arrive home just in time for the happy part of the mood swing (that means no meaningless for for me to shirk until she is off of her cycle), and I go in and start clicking away at my PC. Manipulation. Like mother, like son.   Moving along, what was I going to prattle on aboot next? O yah. Picture day. I was at the place where the pics were to be taken. i hate it. I was showered, fully clothed, clean shaven, and my hair was nicely cut. I was already completely out of my element. Next part of pix being taken somebody tells me what to do. I hate being told what to do. That is different from being asked, being told is being asked, having added the presumption that I will do exactly what they ask. Added on to the fact that i have been told to do things that I don't want to do, it is a stranger. It was a woman (sounds good, right?) but a, ugly, middle-aged one (wrong!), and she had an eyebrow piercing (now THAT'S wrong!). She also talked down to me. I hate that, too. example: (presumptuous tone) "turn right" "What do you mean?" "I mean turn right" "You said that. What do you mean?" (blank stare) (cue stoopid question, aaaaaaand go!) "whaddyoo mean, whaa-ddoo i mean?" I say "Do you mean head, torso, entire body? What do you mean?" (duh tone) "I mean, whole body." She is being an ass, I will too. (blank stare) keeps going, keeps going. "what?" she says. "how far?", I ask. "all the way", she says. I get up. turn all the way around (the left way), and sit back down. "no, that isn't what I meant." "OOOOOOO, right, you meant the other way." I turn twice right, once to make up for the left, and once more to actually turn right. She stops her bull. Well she jsut sed one more thing. The only difference betweent outfits one and two were a tie. So, after outfit one, I get up to get my clip on (the first was a regular tie, so I came with it on after I figured it out.), and she says "Is this going to take a long time?" So I think "Ain't had enough, bitch?, alright.", I turn completely around, Look at her under my eyebrows (Jack the Ripper style), and bark at her. She jumped. I thin she peed a little. I got my tie, and my relative silence from her. I also got her to release her tone. Best pix i have taken. That lets you know how much I dislike them.  Next. I dislike handing out pix. My mom never gets enough wallets, and if she does, she sends them all to ppl near the bottom of our christmas-card list, in hopes they will actually send one back (they don't, maybe I scared them off, or maybe I intimidated them, nah, the first one.). So I only get a few, and they cnan only go to my closest friends. (female friends only, guys dont want pix of their buddies, they know what they look like, which, coincidentally is my excuse for not likeing getting my pic taken, if I want to know what I look liek, I will simply look in the mirror.) But now, this year, my co-workers want some. It is only two, but one is a manager that I am cool with. She is nice, I could not hope for a better superior. The other is a young lady. We are friends. We are only friends because she is a whore. She is playing her ex, against my reccomendations warning aboot his percieved getting of poon once he is done with his menial task. She had him clean her car, inside and out, and then went and made out with another dude I work with that is too much of a pussy to even ask her out. He cried after he was done cleaning the car , beacuse after he was done, she was making out with my co-worker. They are both stoopid pussies. waitwait. All three are stoopid pussies. yaaah. Where was I? O yah, I dunt want to give out too many pix, cuz they are limited. I think I will act mad at Victoria (whore), so I don't have to give her a pic, then give one to Ronda (cool manager). Next, after I have given a cuppla more pix out, if I have one left, I will say I am sry to Torie, and give her a pic to seal the deal. Gawd I am manipulative. Anyway lemme fill in the blanks. Asad (pussy) is dating Victoria (whore). Victoria was dating Chris (car-cleaning, crying pussy). I hope that kid doesn't own binoculars. or a hatchet. I think I will lend him my binoculars. and my hatchet. Nah, I dont feel that sry for him, I mean he IS stoopid, and prolly suicidal, not homocidal. But I wouldn't put the binocular bit past him. Newho, I dont liek him b/c he called my work, and when he was told that working ppl are not available for personal phone calls (Tor understands this), he started to argue. He went right past step 2: ask nice, and straight to step 3: bitchy. This is bad for a few reasons. First, when he was calling as bf, it was personal buisiness, second, he was a man (I don't liek guys I am competing with [I kinda was at the time, I wanted poon, and ignored that she was a whore]), and third, he cussed at me and my co-workers, fourth, he said things about ppl that werk at McD's (even tho his gf werked there), and fifth (man is this guy an asshole!), he said things aboot black ppl. Nice job, pussy, now yer gf talks aboot how yer getting played, and how yer a pussy, and how you dry liek a pussy. Moving on. More on him later. Bradley is Victoria's ex (also co-worker). Brad was a good boy. It was cute how good he was to her, and how good she was to him. It was corny, even. Well, sorta. Victoria parties. Without Brad. I kno what that means, u prolly know what means, too. Brad dint. It din even cross his mind until late in the relationship. He sed to me "u think she's cheating on me?". I sed "i dunno, maybe, maybe not, but that is not something you should jsut throw around within earshot of enbody who gossips around here, cuz it will get out, and she will be offended." he says "well what do i do, then?" I say "wait for eveidence, do not act on suspition." He didn't. He decided to show up at a party. She was all over this one dude. It was nothing overtly sexual, so he just asked her, politely, "what's up with that dude and u?" she says "nothin', don't worry about it." That dude's name was Chris. He was a possesive asshole. Brad eventually catches them doing something overtly sexual, and he breaks up with her. She is not even mildly regretful. She showed up at the McD's, stoned as hell (that is what she says, but I have been wasted, and I kno what ppl look liek wasted, and she dint look wasted from my point-of-view, but she gets benefit of doubt) and she is giggling, jsut laughing it up with friends, and the occaisional co-worker that walks by. Then she leaves. Brad is pissed. "She dint even look sorry" he sed. "I kno", i sed. How could somebody get stoned, right after the broke up with a good guy? Cuz she was playin him? Anywho, it doesn't take long before she realizes how much of an ass Chris really is. He took car keys, told her what to do, and so forth. She dint realize it b4 cuz she had brad to treat her right (he had no sex with her, it is a commitment to God, I think), and Chris to treat her crappy, but fuck her (no pun intended). Brad is not rich, he lives in EC. He boucht her bunches of crap. She liked it. She stepped on him. Moving along, she dumps Chris liek the asshole he is, and is alone. She says she is going to play the kid for stuff, and is warned myslef, and many others, that if she does that, he will expect something in return. If his past show of character is any indication, i think she is in trouble. She got herself in tho, in spite of my advice. Now Brad is with another co-worker, Jen. That hasn't produced any original drama, jsut drama that has stemmed off of the brad-vidtoria-chris-asad thing. She wants stuff that is more expensive than the sutff he gave to Torie. It has been sed that jen and brad were making out in the customore part of the mcdonald's, and so forth. All stoopid. The whole thing is. Dating at work when yer 16 = stoopid. Being a playing whore = stoopid copeting with ex's = stoopid. ppl talking about it = stoopid. the "mature adults voicing their opinion to those involved = stoopid, u get the picture. wait, no you dont, I am mad at you, may u get a pic later, cya whore!
