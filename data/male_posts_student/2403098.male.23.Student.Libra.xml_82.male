I bathed my dog tonight, speaking of him, and all I had to shampoo him with was my Bed Head shampoo.  Boomer now smells like "Moisture Maniac" and I must say it's quite an improvement from "I just rolled around in a dead bird carcass.. Maniac."  I have some new neighbors that live below me.  I've never actually met them, but I hate them.  I smiled once, they didn't seem receptive to my gesture, and plus they made a HELL of a lot of noise moving in one morning while I was sleeping.  They have an infant.  They drive a Ford Explorer and a Ford F150, which both are the same color and both have the same front hood visors on them.  I guess that's the Oklahoma version of having matching Mercedes or something.  They have a doormat that says "We love our vacuum, we found God, and we gave at the office."  If these are not reasons enough to hate someone... well then I don't know what! haha.  Oh, and it's a one bedroom apartment, which for some reason makes my skin crawl to think that there are technically 3 people (counting infant) crowding the floorplan below me with a crib in the corner and baby shit everywhere.  I bet the sink has baby bottles that are not "dishwasher safe" laying in it.  Oh how the identical floor plan below me is an entirely different world!  Lets talk about their doormat though, if we might.  Obviously this is an attempt at humor designed to say "tee-hee.. Go Away" in a clever little way.  It's the type of thing you see at Spencer's Gifts in the mall, laugh at (on the inside, as it is truly not deserving of actual energy), but never something you'd actually PURCHASE AND PUT TO USE.  It does seem a bit forward even.  Maybe they're NOT kidding.  Maybe they really DO want to say "dude, don't come knocking because whatever you're peddling, we don't want it."  Then again, that would be assuming a lot.  It would be assuming that everyone who has a "honk if you.." bumper sticker really wants you to honk if you do indeed ______.  That doormat is kinda eating at me more and more every time I pass by it to walk the dog.  I'm starting to think I should steal it just to  end my annoyance.  Not that I really would, but it might go nicely with my "Pool Closed" sign.  Regardless, the whole thing just kind of makes me want to knock on their door and try to sell them a vacuum, just to see if they would point to the mat and close the door.
