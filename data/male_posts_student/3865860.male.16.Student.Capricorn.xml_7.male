Takes 5hrs to get there as well booooooooring!!!! Had quite a lot of time to think bout stuff and quite a few dreams (i think one was lucid!!!!!) so i will discribeit to you (not that you want to hear about it so im gunna tell you anyway so shut up). Ok, the scene is ancient greece and im some kinda warrior archer bloke in some army thingy, lol me a warrior :) Any way there was loads of people in this army and we were watching the sky because there was a large comet thingy in the sky coming towards the earth like in 'the simpsons'. There was all these rich important dudes having dinner in this house ona hill deciding what to do they had lots of food! Carrying the story on now, this comet thingy got closer and it was a scary flying monster!!!!! I was sooo scared and it was killing loads of people and nobody could kill it. So i ran up to the house where they were having dinner and i told them about it and apparently some of them were wizards so i made freinds with it and it protected me then my sis woke me for up. Damn her i wanted to kill the scary monster!!!!!!!! Well that was my dream if you are a dream person who tells ppl what it means please tell me what it means because i wanna know.  Oh yeah i saw a very green frog jump through my house and i just laughed and said ha a frog and didn't think anything more of it, now i cant remember if it happened or not its really annoying :( I like frogs :) Don't you hate it when people make it obvious that they don't want you around i kinda got that feeling today i wont say when, i just felt it thats all. Thinking also sucks in two years i could be at Uni thats really scary! I dont know how long this blog can go on for so I will stop now, if you wanna hear more about my sucky life speak to me on messenger :p  Tom
