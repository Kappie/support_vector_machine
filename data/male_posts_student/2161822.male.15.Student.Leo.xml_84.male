I would attempt to play basketball but I'll probably end up falling and hurting my leg even more. And I have driver's theory tonight. I hear this is pretty boring. Great. Just great. You think you'd get enough boredom for one day during one period of History class, and now I have driver's theory. Not cool. Tomorrow is the big game. Knicks -vs- Sixers. Of course Knicks will win. Wow these hex codes are  dumb.   Ashley is crazy and Listen to H.I.M.
