I've been here since the third grade. I am now attending Stonewall Jackson Sr. High School. This year has been extremely difficult for me. My grades have dropped dramatically. I've been having other problems too, mainly about the school. It's too crowded, and the program it offers for gifted students is the International Baccalaureate Programme, and, well, let's say, it's just not for me. I'm not one for regular classes, so that puts me pretty much between a rock and a hard place.  My mother and I were talking about all these school problems the week after spring break, back in April. She came up with a solution. She said, in a nutshell, why don't you go up and live with your grandparents in Michigan? I thought it was a joke at first, but later found out that she was serious. I saw the advantages of it, smaller class sizes, no IB, but they did have AP classes, the demographics are better, too, as white people aren't the minority, as it is at my school.  So, my plans to move to Jenison, Michigan began.  I sent an email to my grandmother with our idea, and she called the night that she received it. A little shocked at first, but, after hearing all the details, they both thought it was a rather good idea. My aunt, uncle, and cousin are moving out of my grandparents house, as they have built one of their own. They should be ready to move about mid-June. I will take my aunt and uncle's current room.   I will be moving July 15-17 this year. My aunt and uncle are leaving some furniture, so I just have to bring a bed, for furniture, and all of the stuff that I "own" (like my laptop, guitar, music, clothing, etc.)  That's about as far as we are so far. There's a lot of boring stuff like healthcare and things like that, but nobody wants to hear about that.  I'll write more as we progress with this.  ~josh
