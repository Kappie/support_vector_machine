["5  1/2 Minute Hallway," Poe, 2000]  He said that blogs are really pointless and that if anyone really wanted to know how someone was doing he or she would write/call or whatever. Perhaps he's right. Maybe this whole attempt is really just a waste of time. I'll have to think about this whole thing some more before making a definite decision. ["Waste," Staind, 2001]  White Coat Ceremony was really cool. Afterwards my folks and I went out to eat at Joe T. Garcia's and the fajitas were aaaawesome! Jake Woods called me also, and though I didn't have time to really talk at length today we're hoping to catch up on sunday. Popo (paternal grandpa) will be in town tomorrow. This next week I'll have a lot more free time since they really worked us hard these first 3 weeks, but most of that free time will be spent studying. Studying is fine, but this new material is really tough. I haven't had biochemistry before and in some ways I wish I had taken it my last semester at Duke, but I took easier classes instead and mostly I'm glad that I gave myself a break.  Recommended song: "Old Man," Neil Young, 1972.
