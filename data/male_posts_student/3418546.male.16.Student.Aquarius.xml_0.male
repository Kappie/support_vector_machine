My teachers have been POURING on the homework which I have done almost NONE of... =X  I think, traditionally... School would always _slow down_ in the last few weeks.. and since the teachers know that, that give us homework to compensate for the slowing-downage...when in fact, EVERY teacher is giving loads of work so it's hecktic! Oh well... When all is said and done, two weeks from now--I won't be in school!  I can't let my summer go to shammbles like last, and before that. Sitting on my ass from 5 to 5.. and other _unmentionable_ things. I need to be productive. Next year I signed up for as many possibly honors classes available...and I have never been in an honors class in my LYFE!  This means I need to BUST MY ASS! And not the kind of "Okay Pol, it's sophomore year already i really need to bust my ass"... kind of BUST MY ASS... I'm talking-- REAL kind of bust my ass! YEAH!  Lots of physical activities. Staying focused on work. Lots of rest. haha..yeah..I can do it!  But I always have the option of dropping classes in that first month... Which I hopefully will not have to resort to!
