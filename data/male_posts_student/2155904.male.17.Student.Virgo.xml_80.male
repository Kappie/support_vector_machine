He got up at 9 knowing he was not going to start his paper for a while.  But imagine the irony when he started it around 10:30 and then just worked straight until noon.  He got 3 pages done in that span.  And he finished his paper around 3.  Right when Full House was coming on.  Great timing on his part.  Full House is such a great show.  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen were so cute as Michelle.  And now they're just plain hot.  And Tyke's cousin might end up teaching them next year at NYU.  Cuz she might have to be the TA or whatever for a class that they would have to take.  But the point is that they are really cute as Michelle.  And man does that family ever hug and kiss!!!  They are like a newlywed couple except for the sex part.  And everything gets solved waaaaayyyyyy easy.  Like today DJ was having her 13th birthday party and there was this guy who DJ liked and Kimmee decided to get them to kiss by playing Spin the Bottle.  But then Kevin (the guy) spun the bottle and everybody but DJ jumped back so it automatically landed on her.  Then she got mad, etc.  But anyway DJ had a talk with Becca and they talked about her first kiss and how she will always remember it.  After that, DJ went downstairs and Kevin came back with the card that went with his present to her.  Then they went outside and ended up kissing and DJ was really excited and then they did a fade shot to end the show with the fade-in credits in that San Fran gold coming on.  The relevance to Tyke's life though is that she was all freaked about her first kiss at 13 and Tyke is 17 and he still hasn't had his first real kiss.  Yep, very true statement right there.  You could say that's weird but it isn't.  At least Tyke didn't think so.  Not that Tyke isn't like wanting to kiss someone.  He just hasn't.  Usually you kiss your significant other or partner but since Tyke hasn't had a serious girlfriend then he hasn't had anyone to kiss.  So that explains it.  To explain it well just sing these words: whatever happened to predictability?  The milk man, the paper boy, even MTV.  You miss your old familiar friends, waiting just around the bend.  That show rocks Tyke!  He almost gets knocked over he gets rocked so hard.  To digress, Tyke will talk about the rest of his day.  He did nothing.  Ok, that was easy enough.  Seriously folks, he didn't even do any other homework after his paper.  Albeit his paper was the main reason for doing homework though.  He played some more downstairs bball though.  Or DBB for short.  He can take anyone on in one on one DBB.  He'll go down there on anybody!!!  He ate some and then just looked outside and reveled in the majesty of the picturesque day.  It was such a fine day that he wished he wasn't couped up in his lovely abode doing work.  And not the Joules kind.  Well technically he was but not as in Physics homework.  But he is going to the Physics review night on Tuesday.  That should be learnable hopefully.  Learnation is fun when you really get to learnercise with your brain.  This is getting uninteresting quick.  Tyke is not happy that he has a lot of Photo stuff to do tomorrow though.  Cuz he really does.  Like 3 things he needs to do in class.  And then that other thing also.  And some other stuff too.  So that will suck and all.  And finals start on Wednesday.  People are all worrying and studying for them.  Tyke doesn't so much do that.  Not that type of guy really.  It's all cool though.  Some people just can't be as cool as Tyke.  And Tyke is really quite cool.  Not to toot his own horn and all but he is good.  He will toot his own horn right now but this toot goes out to Amed for whom skips over all the horn tooting that Tyke does in his blog.  So toot yourself a good one Amed.  And don't forget about predictability, or the paper boy, or even MTV!!!
