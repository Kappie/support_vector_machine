By the way, I officially love so called "classic rock", especially Styx, Journey, and REO Speedwagon.  More on that if I feel like it.  I'm gonna be posting more now.  Things have calmed down a lot.  I have my Saturdays back for a while.  Life is ok. It's not good.  My grade took a serious dive last six weeks and it's looking very likely I'll take home my first D on a report card ever.  I may be able to raise it before it gets on my transcript, but not before the six weeks.  And more than likely Mom and Dad will make me quit New Dimension next year if that happens. One more thing:  Orson Scott Card remains the best author ever.  I highly recommend "Maps in a Mirror".   It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.
