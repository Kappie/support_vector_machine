It is mostly clear with faint clouds drifting across the horizon.  The dramatically calm moon piercing the eyes with its metallic whiteness.  A cool crisp air serenely penetrating the warmth and comfort of Tyke's jacket and lingering body heat of Dotti from their late-night cuddlefest.  It was most beautiful.  Tyke felt very at peace and zen-like.  Now to find out why.  The school day was pleasantly easy.  Nothing blogworthy for the first two periods other than there are a bunch of retarded people in Tyke's weight training class.  People are just so stupid sometimes.  So dumb.  Gov was bitchy again.  At least the teacher was.  Ever since the homework incident she has taken over the title Mrs. Dyke-Bitch from Tyke's english teacher.  She is just old and senile and doesn't know who says what and where they said it and is only concerned with sex and horses (and it is unknown whether or not she combines her fancies. ewww).  Lunch was a little above par although the company was 2 strokes below par as Dotti and Purdy were at Pie too.  In 6th period Tyke began his funniness.  Without telling the whole story this little anecdote won't be very funny.  And actually since Tyke isn't going to tell the whole story it still won't be funny.  Except to Purdy because she laughed the hardest of everyone (the cackle came out in fact as Kinker poignantly pointed out).  But basically it came to Purdy saying "I have pants from M.I.T. (the university btw)" and then Tyke ended up saying the joke "What kind of pants do people who go to M.I.T. wear? SMARTYpants!!!"  And it was funny.  Tyke liked it a lot.  He was proud of himself.  He tried to hide his hubris and just play it off but inside he was just patting himself on the back like there was no next Thursday.  After school Tyke went home and played ESPN from 3:30-6.  Then he played poker with Kinker online and he won $23,000.  He was on fire.  And just kept on getting the cards.  It was great.  Tyke made himself a pizza for dinner and it was pretty good but it was piping hot so it was tough to eat comfortably.  Ya'll know what that's like though.  Tyke went over to Purdy's about 8.  Mandy and Tig'Ol/Lisa Lovey were already upstairs with Purdy in her bedroom so Tyke joined for a little while until Dotti came.  Then they went downstairs and a bunch more people showed up later.  Just to name a few...Amed, Macaroon, Tina, Frederique, Ekul, Kramm, Beaner, and others that Tyke hopes he isn't forgetting but he is euphoric right now so it is tough to think of everything exactly like he wants to.  But all those people as well as the ones aforementioned.  All crew that Tyke knows.  All but one he has talked to on multiple occasions.  So Purdy's was great.  Tyke talked a lot to a bunch of people, ran on the treadmill, played ping pong, snuggled up, and just talked.  And there were no residual feelings to anyone at anytime, including now.  Which you probably have no idea how good that feels to Tyke.  But so as not to get into depth Tyke will continue.  Just hanging out with a bunch of people Tyke is friends with and talking about both funny and non-funny stuff is great.  But this time there isn't a real desire for something more that Tyke leaves wanting.  He just leaves happy and content with everything.  Talking with Dotti had a lot to do with it.   They almost solely talked about Tyke.  And, though this could sound vain, it is just great to talk about Tyke and his life.  Even though he almost always does it is helpful.  Tyke explained when he was really happy this year and his situation now and past girl troubles and current ones and just everything.  But it was a pretty happy conversation.  Not depressing at all.  Very chill.  They even talked about Tyke's chest and heart and his parents and everything.  It was just very nice.  Tyke and Tina played some ping pong and Frederique played as well and they were all hyper and such and it was funny.  But Tyke's favorite time was when he was just sitting and talking.  Tyke really does love that.  He cherishes that.  He values that highly.  Tyke and Purdy didn't talk a lot but at the end they shared some laughs.  When Tyke made another smartypants-type joke.  Dotti was saying she gave up sweets and Tyke goes, "Then why are you sitting here with me??"  It was funny.  Purdy said that was a good one too.  Tyke was really on fire.  But not literally.  Man, tonight was a really great night.  Tyke was so pleased with it that he is going to thank everyone that was there.  Thanks (he isn't going to actually go through and name individually cuz that would be superfluous at this point).  But seriously, tonight was great.  Hopefully it won't be a long time until the next night like this.  Because that is not fun.  Tyke can't take the rollercoaster of high school.  And his rollercoaster is probably the weakest one out there.  That's sad.  But Tyke is afraid of heights and such and doesn't like rollercoasters.  But that's beside the point.  Basically, the moon is out and so is Tyke.
