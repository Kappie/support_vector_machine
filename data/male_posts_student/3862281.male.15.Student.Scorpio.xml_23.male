Reason being that I only ever post about things that randomly pop in my head in the short periods that I'm not day dreaming or reminiscing over old memories and I tend to only be depressed at these times. Fortunately, I haven't felt very depressed lately, hell, I feel great at the moment (just completed Devil May Cry on 'Dante Must Die' mode...jebus that was hard, I'm not even very good at that game in the first place), therefore I haven't really thought about anything worth posting lately, unless ofcourse saving the world from a giant meteor which was sent by god and then single handedly wiping all human life of the face of the Earth interests you (day dreaming's fun). hmmmm... Well actually that does sound quite interesting, to me atleast. Might make a post about a random day dream I have on a later date then. Ah well, just thought I'd say this so that you don't think I've forgotten all about my quaint little blog of depressing stuff. AAAARGH!!!! I'm making jokes!!!! On my blog of depressing stuff!!!! What is wrong with me?! *explodes* ... Did I just write that? Ok,  now  I think I need therapy. I think I'd best leave before the sarcasm kicks in. Like that would ever happen! DAMNIT!!!
