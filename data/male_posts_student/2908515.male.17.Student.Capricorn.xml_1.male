I think I am like a rollarcoaster fueled by overthinking.    It seems that more and more, I am in a world my own.  Not really paying attention to the things going on around me and acting strange to people.  I analyze things people do and things they don't.  I'll ask myself that if I had done this, would people like me better?  I'll get pissed off at people for things I would never normally get pissed off at.  I'll see things differently.  One minute I'll feel sorta happy and the next minute, I'll feel angsty and against the world in general.  I am never directly mad at people, just generally mad at people.  Although sometimes I'll single people out, it doesn't mean that I hate them.  Just means that I am annoyed by what they did, or did not do.  I don't want to go to a couple of classes tomorrow.  Maybe I'll skip.  But I can't really skip any classes.  All of them are important and the periods in which I have idle classes, I'm already in orchestra.  Well, except for 9th period.  I guess I can skip that.  I don't know.  I think I worry about what people think of me too much.  I should worry less about that.  Some people will always be better than me.  And I will have to accept that.  I guess.    I guess about a lot of things.  And I don't know about a lot of things either.  It just is.  And there's nothing I can do about it.  I think I need a hobby.  Or some courage to confide in people.  pfft, who reads this anyway.
