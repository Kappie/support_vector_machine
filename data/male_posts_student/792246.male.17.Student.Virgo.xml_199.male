There are some losses I'm prepared to accept with super saver shipping. For example, an order placed on the 19th shipping on the 26th. A week seems like a pretty generous amount of time to give them to ship something. So when it takes longer than that, I was a little bit annoyed. But that it didn't ship today has made me decide to be irrationally angry.  So I'm irrationally angry.
