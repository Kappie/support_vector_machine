Tonight was kind of a bummer, but not at the same time.  That happens and it's weird.  Oh well.  You get what I mean.  Anyways.. on to the story.  Whit, Peglow, Hudson and I were going to go bowling and we went around to all 3 bowling allies (sp?) looking and only finding that they were all full!  What the hell?  Since when do bowling allies fill up?  Well I guess it was National Bowling Day again, am I right?  So we decided against bowling and rented a few movies.  We got 40 days and 40 nights.  It was a bummer.  I guess it wasn't too bad thought.  I almost forgot to say how after the movie Whitney and I played pool in real life and she kicked my ass.  She's pretty good at the pool... so watch out if you ever play her.  :-) Hah!  That's about it.  Oh by the way, I'm starting to write everyone's birthday down.  If I don't have yours, let me know it so I can say "Happy Birthday!" when your birthday comes.  Other than that, have a nice night/morning.  Night.
