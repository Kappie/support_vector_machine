I have to stick it out and just deal with these alien feelings but it is just so uncomfortably agonizing to be on the edge of a cliff waiting for the bridge to be built so I can attend to business on the other side.  My eyes are clearly obstucted to the original problem. I am the constructor of this 'bridge' - I am to blame. Dammit. I am looking forward to the weekend. I can hit the books and spend the seed of my resume as far as I can email AND fax.  Yesterday evening I went out to my little sisters birthday party - she seemed to have tons of fun. The drive over there was some were around an hour longer than normal thanx to the speeding idiots and rain. By the way, the two spell disaster.  I was so beat on arrival that I feel straight to sleep the instant I laid on a bed.   >>>>>>>>>>>>BUUUUUUZZZZZZ  I jumped right up and a panic washes over me like I just realized I am terribly late for work - It was just my mom's egg timer. That was a weird feeling.  So I head back to A's and surf around a bit and slam a big zzzzSLUMBERger.zzzzzzz Ymmmmmm!   current mood:  energetic current music: jawbreaker - etc. rockin' the B-sides!
