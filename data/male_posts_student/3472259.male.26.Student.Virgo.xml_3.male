You may ask, "How can you believe in god but not be a christian/muslim/jew?"  I respect the teachings of all religions, but I can not state that any one is the TRUTH.  Call me of little faith, and whatnot, but hey, I am not that smart that can state that I know what is unknowable.  There is a question that has lingered throughout history, "what's it all about."  What is the answer to Life, the Universe and everything, other than 42 (hitchhikers)?  This question, as questions often do, led to more questions.  Why is it that humans are congnizent and no other animal seems to be?  There are animals that communicate, solve problems, even make tools, but why are humans the only ones on this planet to exhibit our brand of intelligence.  The previous statement may be contended.  That humans are the only ones who understand the coming of death can't be.  This makes us the only ones who question as we do.  Sheer Darwinist thinking can not explain this to me.  If it is merely evolution then it must be that humans out competed every form of being that displayed similar mental or lingual characteristics.  This seems possible, yet why do animals that would not share a niche with humans not develop such intelligence, or even something similar?  If our self awareness is only consequence of evolution then what is the meaning of life.  Given only this as a basis, the entire purpose of one's life would only be survival of the genetic line.  Since our abilities were developed to survive, then survival and procreation are the only meaning of life.  Humans ask questions of not only life but of death.  To an atheist there is nothing after death, only the rearrangement of molecules and energy.  This picture of life and death is not exiting.  Is there nothing more to life than life?  This is a picture of a meaningless existence.  To all atheists; Since time is infinite, and our existence definite, do we exist at all, or are we worthless pyres of cosmic energy?  It may be arrogance, but I refuse to envision that humanity has been awakened and separated from the other animals for absolutely no reason whatsoever, other than successful survival.  The philosophical dilemmas that have plagued us are questions that would not be asked by an organism focused merely on survival.  What purpose would these questions serve?  I believe that God separated us from the animals. I believe it is God that has made us self aware and that God has a reason and a purpose for us all.  We are not simply wasting away the rest of the big bang.  What we are here for is an unanswerable question, at least in this existence.  I personally believe god has given us a problem.  That we must come together as humanity and learn to live peacefully on, and with, the Earth.  I see religious teachings as being a way to achieve this goal.  But since our religions are to busy playing the "I'm right, you're wrong" game we lose sight of the true goal and thus are not doing a good job at this at all.  What is after death?  I have no Idea.  I would like to think that this world is a test, and that there is more to existence than just this.  If this is true than I believe that being a good person, while on this earth, is extremely important.  If nothing exists after death then this is it.  Therefore, being a good person is less a necessity, but a way to achieve greater happiness. Either way you look at it,  IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE A GOOD PERSON .
