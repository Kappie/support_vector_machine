We had a Cross-cultural presentation done by all the countries (a Humurous 10 minute skit which talks about your home country).We did a skit on Traffic in India (partly inspired by the famous Baan forwarded mail) and at the endall the Indians gathered on the stage to sing the Indian national Anthem .
