Jessica:  Yeah. Michelle:  Do you want me to tell him to stop? Jessica:  No, it's fine. Isn't that good?!  I think it's purty darned good news.  I'm still gonna ask her the next time I talk to her if she minds me callin' and talkin' to her.  I've written a survey for all the ELMS high school students and an answer sheet for the teachers.  I ask a few questions about if students think the required standing during the Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional.  Boy is that gonna make some teachers mad.  But I think that it will help everyone because "knowledge is power" and the more knowledge one possesses the more well-protected anyone is.  That's my goal in this, along with learning what students know about their rights as students.  Enewayz, we'll see how this goes tomorrow.  I've got to write this damned paper now.  Ugh, I have  zero  motivation to write this crap.  Oh well, here I go...
