We argued all over a damn thread, then I blocked and deleted her and Mike from MSN. Friendship over, it seems. Whatever. Now she can free up her time and devote even more of it to Mike. Mike isn't even all that good looking anyway. I've seen much better.  After that, Ali tells me that she loves me. This was a shock..she said she loved me for a while, but didn't say anything because I was with Nikki. Ali ends up winning me over.......
