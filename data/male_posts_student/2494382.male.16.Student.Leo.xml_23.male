Most of us know that TPing means toliet papering(unless ur travis jacobson and didnt realize taht till like a month ago). i think that TPing is a good time and if you TP someone u should do a good job for the purpose of them having to clean it up linger and teh self satisfaction taht u actually did a good job. yes i do TP people, and yes i do get TPed. id just like to bring up that someone tried to TP me last night and it was the most embarising job ever. so i hope whoever did it brags about it and tries to fell cool about it but then they will read this and feel like an idiot becasue they used about 5 rools. and all of those rools were about shoulder level in my tree. my cat cleaned it up. it took him 5 minutes. and hes fat. so there you have it i will see u all in about 16 minutes.
