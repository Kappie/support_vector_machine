Got there around 10am, 5 mins before the end of English (I decided I didn't feel like going to it). Then it was recess, so we went and kind of pissed off the "special" students. Then it was time for Maths. I did around 5 questions I think, and  just sat there listening to music, and talking to people. There was only around half the class at school today. Anyway, then it was 2nd recess, so we went and pissed off the "special" students again...  THen it was time for third period, and instead of going home I decided to go to my friends software design class. I got kicked out before I even got in the door, and got the door slammed in my face, and laughed at in the process. Then someone asked me if I could learn a  Muse  song for them for their music assessment, so I guess I should learn that sometime. Anyway, I decided to phone my mum since there was no point staying at school, and I drove down to the music shop to buy a capo, and I decided to spend some money on a  Nickelback  tablature book. Anyway, I got home, and came on here. My new post didn't work, so I stopped, played a game, then went to drive slot cars at someones house.  Not a bad little track it was, and I ended up getting the second fastest time ever on the track, I just couldn't push it enough to get the extra .05. Anyway, I got home, and booted up the pc, uploaded a few photos, and here is where I am now.  I have to catch the bus to work tomorrow, and will probably have to get up around 10am...spewin about that.
