I'm defaintely going to miss the summer when it's over. I was home alone all this weekend, it was really fun! I went to the SBH show in Grand Rapids with them and we stayed over night in Holland. Our friend, Danielle, lives there on a lake and stuff. Then I was hanging out with a bunch of people, but I was never really home alone.        I don't really know how I'm doing though, even though all this fun stuff has been going on, I'm still not in a very good mood. Yeah, its awesome hanging out with friends and stuff, but I want something more. I've been thinking about this one girl that I really like but I dunno whats gunna happen with that. We don't really hang out alot or even at all but I think since I'm not as busy anymore I'll be working on doing more stuff with her.      I've got it bad.      ~Timmy
