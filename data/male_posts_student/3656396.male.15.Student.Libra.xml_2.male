No, I dont mean a false christian god, created by insecure existentialists..., I mean real people, flesh and blood, (not your mom) who geuinely care about how you feel, its cool.  Lacy to me, is one such person... She makes me smile when I think of the things she says, and I know I would kill thousands of people just to be with her in need, not that the lives of the masses mean much, but still, not one of them could ever amount to how I feel about her...  yeah, as I sit, waiting for her yahoo im to pop up in an hour or two, I cant help but smile when I reflect on our relationship... weve had some missunderstandings, but hey,! now were better for it. if you ever get the off chance to read this lacy, hugs  kisses, hope to see ya soon baby.
