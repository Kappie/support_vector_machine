The track at 20 mins or so is fucking tight. Has a little delayed guitar lick reminiscent of the days when Cass n Slide didn't suck. oh sweet nostalgia.   Apparently, I have a new arch-nemesis. I know what you are thinking...is it  urlLink Swarm ? Thankfully, no. For I lack the power, stamina, and wit to thwart such a foe. If you do not empathize with my fear, simply  urlLink listen  to his battle cry and i assure you---you will tremble. (Also, it would behoove you to  urlLink listen  to Kraven as well, apparently someone taped him "introducing" himself to some chick he just banged in the park. And, seriously, how creepy is fucking  urlLink Arachnoid ?! (interrobang, bitch...what.))  According to reliable  urlLink sources  my foe is none other than Denise Bracken. You got it. The new jack. All because I got Ice-T's back. Now she is a turncoat and conspiring with others to turn them against me.   Apparently Denise isn't aware of the high-school fight song I penned:  Sport the war, war support The sport is war, total war When victory's a massacre The final swing is not a drill It's how many people I can kill  Much to my chagrin, the faculty did not choose this fight song...something about legal issues and legions of die-hard heshers (who are no doubt sporting  urlLink these  fine specimens).    Nevertheless, let this vain admission of attempted high-school spirit stand as a warning to aforementioned nemesis. My evil has no boundaries, my arteries are hardened, I stalk from behind the crooked cross, a spirit cloaked in black...and you, my dear, are an expendable youth.   Now, if you will excuse me I must go attempt, and fail, to blow my head off with a  urlLink shotgun .   \m/ IO IO IAO IO  urlLink PAN  \m/
