This was just all of the varsity wrestlers who did not make it to regionals.  We stayed up late drank mountain dew and played 8 person halo.  It was fun.  Then, when we were at regionals, four of us went out to find food, and i was driving and broke almost all of the rules of the road.  Good times.  Then after regionals we all went back to the house where the party was and ate chips and played some more halo, then we went home.  That was my day.
