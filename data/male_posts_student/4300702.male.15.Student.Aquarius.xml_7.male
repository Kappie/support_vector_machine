Besides the continuous dropping of cutlery, and dazing off into space due to the wake up time of 8:30 * sigh *, it was pretty good. It was a birthday for an 80 year old, so of coarse they were all old fogies. Oh, and some old guy called me " darling ", not as a complement, but as how you would call your significant other. That freaked me out just a little bit. But overall, it kicked butt, oh, and I got these balloons!!!        I still can't figure out how they got them inside, unless the ballon is really strechy.     Spoon Boy away!  (lol jenn), well apparently I am now to be known as  Spoon Boy  at work, a trusty side kick of Knife Man! wow..... Yeah.. Don't ask.
