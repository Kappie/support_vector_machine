I obviously haven't progressed beyond my rampant usage of run-on sentences, or reoccuring sentence structure to create mild amusement for myself.  I also added the adorable GIF at left, which I swiped(hey, if she can't write English, how is she going to know?) from a very sweet Japanese girls website. The observant among you will notice that this girl does the the entire Rajio Taisou, in all it's glory. Enjoy it. I know you will appreciate it as much as me.  Wasn't that the most beautifully erotic thing in a while? For those of you that I don't regularly rant at online, I am referring to the storm. It was sexy. I want to make love to it, even if there was a stupid gate banging into my outside wall every 5 seconds. Also, my message this morning was cut off by my Math teacher happening to walk through the library. So yes, I did not get to add an all important message at the end.   Oh of course, I have to have mentioned that in the NEXT post. Wow, these commentaries are getting more and more useless by the post. Especially since almost this whole post is about changes to the site which are no longer in any way relevant. Oh well.
