On Friday I had a morning meeting in Helen Wood Hall over by the Med Center.  A nice long walk with Garry and Nancy.  We talked about a bunch of stuff and Garry had a story to tell.  After standing on my feel for what felt like hours, Garry told me I could sit down.  Cindy asked if we could go to Pelligrinos since she wasn't feeling good, so I said sure and we walked there for lunch.  I find that my dress shoes are not meant for walking.  My toes got so torn up by the walk that I had to walk barefoot on the way back because it hurt so much.  We got food and ate in my apartment.  I checked for mail and still didn't see anything, so when I got back to work I filled out the form at the USPS website to have it forwarded.  It cost $1 to do it online.  I later got home and found my mail had indeed started being forwarded and I wasted $1.  Shame.  That is useful laundry money.  Laura came and visited me at the end of my work and I convinced her to stay until 5.  Cindy came as well and we all decided to go back to my apartment and hang out for awhile.  I had a dinner date with mom, so although it was fun spending time with Laura, Cindy and eventually Jake, I kept watching the clock.  Laura left and Jake arrived a little bit later.  He was dropping off my shaving kit and contact solution that I left at the old place.  He, Cindy and I played Skip Bo for a little bit.  I told them I had to go, Cindy decided she wasn't going to come with me at the last minute and I headed to historic Canandaigua.  Jake and Cindy went to a movie.  Dinner with mom was fun.  I got to listen to a couple 911 calls, including a woman that was screaming that she was being attacked by a dog.  She kept getting disconnected.  These calls went on for almost an hour.  The hair was standing on end on my neck.  A deputy finally found her and we assumed she was dead.  But it turned out the dog wasn't attacking her, but humping her prized $1600 show dog, which was in heat.  Ha.  I sat with mom for two hours, we ate subs, talked, laughed, she gave me a bunch of fish from a former intern there and I went back to Rochester.  Jake was waiting at my parking lot, I called and invited Laura over (who was ready for bed at 10pm on a Friday night :) ) and we all hung out for awhile.  We then went to the Distillery, had some chicken wings, potato skins and drinks.  Laura went home and Jake and I went back to my place.  We talked for awhile, but he fell asleep on my floor even though the cat loves when people are within jumping distance.  Quote from Jake: No kitty.. stop it kitty!  Don't bite that!  Saturday came with an early vet appointment for the cat.  She got her stitches out and was felt up by the doctor.  She said she's a beautiful cat and is so friendly, and that's a good sign.  Afterward I dropped of the cat and went to Wegmans to buy some food.  I was just going to pick up some chili or something, but I got really disgusted at the price of everything I saw I left and went to Walmart.  I bought some soda, chips and headed home.  It's starting to be a problem, living so close to everything.  I can just get in the car and go.    I cleaned up the apartment for awhile, and watched a bunch of TV.  Cindy came over for awhile and we made plans to see an improv show that night.  Laura called and invited me to dinner with her parents, but they also wanted to drop by the Distillery first.  Cindy had just walked in so I invited Cindy to come with us to the Distillery.  We had Margaritas and watched the horse race really quickly.  I dropped Cindy off and went to Aja Noodle.  I had the Wok Fried Rice with egg rolls.  It was great, as always.  Very filling.  By the way, Laura's parents are looking very thin.  It's hard to recognize them when you remember them being heavier people.  They've accomplished a lot over the last couple of years.  I came back and Cindy and I went to the Elmwood for some drinks.  She bought wings and a pitcher of beer.  I tried the beer, I didn't like it, but I drank half of it anyway.  The wings were terrific.  We later went to the improv show at the Geva theatre.  It was extremely funny, Cindy even was invited up on stage and she was funny.  Lots of jokes, lots of innuendo.  Cindy went home with someone else, I went home and fell asleep after watching another couple hours of TV.  Exciting.  Sunday brought more cleaning.  My new couch was coming at 10:30 and my place was just very dirty.  I got the vacuum out and did some cleaning and Emily and her father came with Jesse.  We unloaded the truck and was it difficult to get into the apartment.  We had to take the door off the hinges and the feet off the couch just to get it wedged into the door.  Finally got it in and they were gone like the wind.  I couldn't even offer them a drink before they were ready to go.  Oh well, I had a couch to break in!  Cat loves the couch, by the way.  I'd love to say my day was exciting, however, I did laundry and went to UR to dry it.  Saved me $3, so why not.  I dropped it off and went to WalMart for my week's supply of food.  I spent an hour taking my time buying everything from meat to plates.  I got to the last part of my trip, the pet aisle and I was looking for food for the bottom feeders.  I found it, turned around and my cart was gone.  Someone took my cart full of food.  I looked every where for it, first thinking maybe I left it somewhere.  But they had left their cart behind, so I knew someone took it.  I went to customer service and asked them to announce it and ask anyone finding they had the wrong cart to return it to the pet department.  They refused.  They said "Just get another cart and shop again."  Imagine this in a true Rochester/Chili accent.  So I did, I went and got another cart and reshopped for all my previous items.  I get to the pet aisle to buy some kitten shampoo and low and behold someone brought my cart back (with a couple items they had picked up).  Ugh, I was disgusted.  Now I had two carts with the exact same stuff.  So I unshopped.  I returned one set of everything back to their shelves.  After my afternoon of FUN at WalMart, I got my laundry and sped home, vowing never ever to shop at WalMart again [today].  Cindy visited and stayed until 1am.  We watched TV, played Skip Bo, memory, washed the cat (she's so cute when she's wet), clipped her nails and fed her meat from Cindy's sub.  Well, she grabbed it and ran.   urlLink    My Cat is An Alien!  I biked to Kim's Asia (after getting lost on my way) and picked up some Sesame Tofu.  On my way, my handlebars got really loose and I almost fell off three times.  I took Cindy home after we debated whether she should stay or not.  This morning I awoke to a very disgusting fish tank.  The fish mom gave me from the other night are gross.  Their tank is murky already and it was fish poo everywhere.  Bowser never did that. Sheesh.  I went to work and visited Emily, who promptly asked Cindy and I to continue to blog.  She's interested in what we do. :)  I said hello to my other coworkers, several of which wouldn't give me the time of day.  I seem to be bothering them when I say hello in the morning.  What's that about?  I had lunch with Linda out on the quad, which was nice.  Birthday party with the Finance people at 1.  Not much going on, I need to finish this project for Nancy.  I'll blog later.  Tomorrow night I get internet!
