Well pre-emption is a policy which has been practiced by the US since many years now but still it isn't a safe place, 9/11 clearly throws light on the sought of threats that the American people face. Pre-emption can be productive if exercised with caution unlike what Mr.Bush wants to do, bomb anyone who doesn't agree with you. I am afraid the way Bush administration has been handling this doctrine it has led to the loss of credibility of the US and her allies. Just because you have military might doesn't necessarily mean that you are safe or invincible. But it does mean that you can always prevent an attack from taking place. What US needs at the moment is a strong intelligence network and help from all powerful nations. If Afghanistan and Iraq can become a model of democracy for the Arab world then it will surely help the US tremendously in the global fight against terror. But as things stand at the moment it looks highly unlikely that Iraq would be able to become that sought of a role model for its neighbors, so the world can pin its hopes to Afghanistan which might just put it off. As of now the policy of pre-emption has failed to impress more people then the number whom it has impressed.
