My Grandpa is a really good piano player so I wanted to see if he could play "Sairway to Heaven" by Led Zeppelin and a few people who have cared to ask know that I LOVE them....not in a gay way you frikkin pervs but y'all know what I mean. But he couldn't cuz a few of the parts are like two chords mixed together and he couldn't do that on piano. If you notice at the top of my bloggie I changed my little quote thing. It's from a song by Yngwie Malmsteen who is a totally awesome guitar player....plus I think he may be Jewish with a last name like Malmsteen lol. But if you thought Van Halen was fast, you should check out some of his old albums. Thats all for now.
