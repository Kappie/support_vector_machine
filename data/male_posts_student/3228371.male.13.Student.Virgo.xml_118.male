I got a long freakin lecture from my mom about the squeezed up schedule that we had... disorganization. Wtf...   I  was  gonna take a group photo of us but nooo! The basement's got laundry! Blah blah blah... whatever. So now my mom's pissed because I didn't take any fuckin group photos and crap and it'll take ages to get it developed... you know what the best part is? The deadline is 5pm. I already got us an extention for writing the staff but thats it. Only the staff is allowed to be late. Nothing else. What the crap... This sucks ass. I thought that we might've had a small chance but you know what? Screw it. I thought this would all work out, but no. I was wrong. I thought we could've done this but no. It's all gone now. My motivation, my enthusiam for this whole music thing? Gone. I had faith in our group that if we tried hard enough, we could get somewhere someday but not anymore. Our designated drummer's resigning from the role of drumming and also resigning from the band after grad. My opinion is that we can do this without anybody but Nima and/or Moca. Seriously. I mean that. But you know what? Whatever. Screw it. I don't care anymore. This is so dumb. I can't stand this anymore. So many comments kept to myself... and they're remain kept to myself... I'll probably share them with Nima and Ingrid but thats it. Nima will know what I'm talking about but not Ingrid... I'll explain to her and I know she'd listen anyway 'cos well... we listen to each other bitch about anything and everything so yeah. God bless Nima and Ingrid.  Things with Erica are cool. I'm so glad we're back to normal. I need her really bad right now. I'll call her later if I get the chance. Really need to talk to her about so much stuff in my head. I could scream. Jeez...  Bethel tomorrow night... so much going on tomorrow I think I might skip Bethel just to stay home that night and punch out walls or something. Or I might go and use that time and tell Ingrid everything... if she shows at Bethel, that is. Otherwise, I'll talk to Auntie Amy about everything. Iunno... whatever.  Ingrid talked to me on MSN just now and I didn't wanna talk. I never do that... I feel bad... but yeah. I'll apologize later.   I really don't need this. I can do without this in my life right now. Honestly. Moca's lecture at recess [dot dot dot], Mom's lecture [wtf...], photos, deadline, recording. Wtf... I hate this. Why did I tell them I found this stupid contest anyway. If I never told them then my hopes wouldn't have been brought up so high that it had to drop now. I wouldn't have all this on my mind. So fuck it. Too late to back down now... Brian and Roger will get annoyed after working on it...   Moca keeps mentioning the $1000 prize money for FIRST PLACE but she thinks we can't go far in this contest so why keep mentioning it? [...]   Look here she comes now Bow down and stare in wonder Oh how we love you No flaws when you're pretending But now I know she Never was and never will be You don't know how you've betrayed me Somehow now you're everybody's fool   Lyrics might've been mixed up but I think y'all get what song it's from so whatever. Anyway... gonna go now.   Just forgot to mention... this started off to be a pretty good day and it ended up like this... I guess I brought this all onto myself?   100th day... Nima got me a rose... very pretty. I loved it. It was cool except for the Jordan incident but my mom's hanging it upside-down to dry it out and I'll get to keep it in my room so yeah... thanks Nima. I love you.
