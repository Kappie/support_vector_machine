King Arthur -Pretty brutal with the battles, and a little unreal in parts, but its a pretty good movie if you liked LOTR.  2. Dodgeball -A Ben Stiller pseudo comedy...enough said. If you want a good summary, head over to Amelia's blog, which can be found  urlLink here .  3. Spider-Man 2 -I didn't see the first, but I don't think it could've been much better. It was surprisingly enjoyable for a comic-book character based movie.  4. Anchorman -Will Ferrill poses as anchorman for a network. Very funny movie.  I'm off to bed.
