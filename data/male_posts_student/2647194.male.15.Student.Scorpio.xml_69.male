Unlike some other people, math actually applies to me-I plan to be a mechanical engineer and make lots of money. Or....I can be a cool musician and not make lots of money.  Science: Worked on the lab because everyone, almost, was gone on the Spanish field trip.  Band: Still, everyone was gone. I went outside, attempted to work on my math homework, and ended up increasing my supply of paper wedges to about 30, along with many rubber-bands. lol.  Spanish: With Pullar as a sub, we couldn't pull a whole lot, so I ended up working, and finishing, my math homework during this hour.  English: Whoohoo!!! Another deadline whooshes by! There's a quote somewhere about that, but its already been used in Amelia's blog, so I won't. Plus, this english paper is about the only big thing thats happened recently, so I don't think I have that much of a right to use it.  Social: Test tommorow. Oh sh*t. Haven't studied at all! Eh, thats what Band, Spanish, and Science are all for, right??  Despues de escuela: Lets see...I had a really nice ride out on Napolean (my bike) today, with one hell of a Northwest wind. Must have been gusting up to like 40, and I had to ride straight into it. It did do one thing good though-propell me swiftly up Pullman hill-that was fun.  Other than that, I did the dishes, avoided cleaning up after my crippled canine, did homework for about 10 minutes, got gradesheets signed, and updated my blog. Other than that, not a whole lot new.  A few notable grades I got: Band: 100% (really easy) Biology: 82.6% or something. She still hasn't credited my for that stupid lab report on the primates...  There were others, but I don't care to remember them. No, I did not fail any classes, even though I know some of you wish it. lol.  I shouldn't be on right now, so I'm off, with no send off lyric, or quote. Sorry.
