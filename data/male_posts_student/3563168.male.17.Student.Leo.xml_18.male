Some people don't like McDonalds, but I don't care, because the problems I'll encounter from it won't come back to haunt me for 20 so odd years.  Then Ross bought me another piece for the chess board I'm making, props to Ross for that. When I finish the chess set, he'll be the first one to see it.  So long story short, Marvin has 18 pens: 12 are black ones and 6 are blue ones.    "King Hottie"  Bow before King Hottie, because he is King Hottie!!!!
