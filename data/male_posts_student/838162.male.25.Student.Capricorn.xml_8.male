And I don't think the prices have changed much since last month. But I decided that I should get the most updated prices so I can resubmit my proposal for the budget for my upgrade plan. Maybe I should wait for the prices to come down after the new Intel and AMD processors come out.  Started watching again my "Cowboy Bebop" DVD last nite. This anime has a funky sci-fi retro feel to it. Mostly helped by it's kick ass, almost totally Jazz, soundtrack. There's even a Carol King track in there I belive. All Jazz fans should check this series out. As for how it does as an Anime, it's pretty good. A little slow paced for an action anime, but thats because it needs to set the style that is the trademark of the series. The main characters are deep and realistic (except for one very noticeable exception) unlike another sci-fic/retro action anime "Trigun". "Cowboy Bebop" is Very highly recommened.   >
