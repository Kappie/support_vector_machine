  Another attempt at blogging starts here. I hope to use this blog in conjunction with  urlLink this one . My main goal in these blogs is to fiddle with templates and learn some html. In addition, I hope to use this blog to improve my photography skills, and my other one to work on writing. Finally, I plan to make both of these blogs available for my friends and family to keep tabs on me when I go to Germany. 
  Posting on both may be slow at first, but I'll work on it.
