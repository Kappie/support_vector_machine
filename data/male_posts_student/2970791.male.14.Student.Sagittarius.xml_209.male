Anyway, for all of you Vines lovers out there (like myself). Here's the most amazing music video ever!!!!!!... Ride...(I'm lazy so just cut and paste this in the address box yourself)... http://www.nme.com/features/107518.htm  If you want more of my pointless ramblings of CN or the lyric to Ride, go to my blog...you know where it is...
