Yesterday I went to the big new Ikea.. omg its huge lol people were parking like anywhere it was soo crowded, but we got extremely lucky and got a spot like 3 parkings spots away from the entrance. I bought a new desk.. and my 'rents got some chairs for the living room. hmm.. all last night I built my desk.. and then I went to bed because that wore me out lol.  Then today I put my computer and stuff on my desk, and cleaned up my room because everything from my desk was everywhere. Then I had a dentist appointment at 10:30 and they still think I need to get braces :-(. i DON'T want them.. that would suck.. cuz of band.. I might be getting them in May. Then I would have all summer to get used to playing with them. :-(;:)      Then I was kind of bored the rest of the day until like 4:30. I read some of To Kill a Mockingbird.. and then before I left for band, and I had some vanilla ice cream with whipped cream.. but it was kind of weird.. I dunno.. it wasn't old.. but it was weird.. the whipped cream like left this stuff on the spoon.. and well that ice cream kinda grossed me out... maybe I shouldn't eat anymore of it.. well at least it wasn't like rotten or something and I didn't get sick and throw up at band.. that would've sucked..  Well, band was a lot less demanding today.. lol.. well except for playing.. my lips were still dead afterwards.. like they always are.. damn high notes! there's a reason to hate first part.. lol.. grr Well outside practice was kind of fun today I guess.. well for the hour we were outside cuz then it started raining at like 8 so we had to go in.. and PRACTICE MORE MUSIC! damn music and high notes! lol well the opener sounds awesome.. and I want to try and find the music for the closer.. is it called Wild Nights?.. I'll look on iTunes.. I wanna learn more drill! thats the best part.. cuz i HATE fundamental block :-(. no new drill today :( we worked on the only 4 sets the trumpets have! lol (10-13) stupid props! well i guess since we're behind a prop for 9 sets then we don't have to really worry about style as much for the beginning.. unless a judge is back there.. =-0   Ok that's enough for today.. I guess I'll go search for Wild Nights.. and maybe someone will get online and talk to me! its only 11:52!
