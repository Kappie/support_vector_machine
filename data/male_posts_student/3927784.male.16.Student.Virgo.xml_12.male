Anyway, when i was on the confirmation page, it said a couple of things:  1) I was born in the year of the rabbit apparently 2) 4 people have looked at my profile  ok, the first one doesnt really have any importance, but i was shocked that that many people have viewed my profile! Shocked! I didnt really expect anyone to look at it. I wouldnt be suprised if there was less than that who viewed the main page.  Anyway, since i'm already on here, i thought i'd discuss a couple of things:  - I watched I, Robot the other day, and i must say that i thought i would enjoy it a little more. Dont get me wrong, i did like it and all, but i expected more...i dont know what, but oh well. For those that dont know what its about, then i'm going to say now. Dont worry its not a spoiler. Will Smith plays Del Spooner who doesnt trust robots, and finds it hard since he lives in a world with them. Then, the robots become bad to the.....bolts! And you can pretty much guess the rest. I'd give it 6/10, but i think other people would enjoy it more. I prefer comedy to action anyway.  2. I watched that Peter Kay live last night and although it was the 2nd time i'd seen it (thanks to martin for lending it me 1st time) it was still funny and i was in bits, my sides were splitting, i was wetting myself, i was rolling on the floor laughing, i was laughing out loud, i was...... ok i'm exagerating there, but i enjoyed it again, and one day i'm going to buy it for myself on DVD. I think i'll mark this aswell, and give it 10/10!  3. Big Brother final Friday, and i still want Dan to win. He takes the piss out of Nadia and his funny, what more could you want from a BB contestant? Oh wait, people want transexuals to win these days. I'll tell you what, it really pisses me off when Nadia runs out of fags, because it happens about once a week and it bores me! I agree that she has been shown in a good light, but what would she of done to be shown in a bad light. I'd of loved it if she brought her "off cuttings" into the house with her! Last night i was shocked, SHOCKED! that stuart went. And i thought it was sad how he went.  Awwww poor Chicken Stu!  Anyway, i might aswell do a full Big Brother 5 Review sometime over the next week, and i probably will throw in what i think of everyone in it.   Until then,
