Its about a 37 Chapter Book we are reading in class and I only read one chapter. Great.  To top all that, I got a lot of homework to do.  Next time I should pay attention in Ms Murphys bio class. I hate that bitch. We are disecting frogs on wednesday.  I dont know who the fuck thought of disecting animals but whoever did should be shot.. 9 times. lol. I make jokes too ya' know. :-P  I am going down to my beach house in seaside memorial weekend.  That will be sweet as hell.  I need to get tan but knowing me I'll get whiter down there. Now, to top off the rest of my day... My computer is a piece of shit.  I need to get a new one. lol.  Seriously, I might just restart everything because I got some  spyware  on my computer that messes up everything.   Yes.. Melissa.. I will remember your CD!   Finally. LoL.  After 2 or 3 weeks. lol.  My subprofile should be updates soon with another graphic.  Check it out.
