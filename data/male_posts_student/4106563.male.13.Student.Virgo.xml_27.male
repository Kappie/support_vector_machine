Well, if you've been watching TV, you probably won't see one of their "monthly orgasim commercials". Making a guess of probability (oh, gives a fuck about math!?), the conclusion would be television-wise, "It's cancelled.". Maybe the reason they cancelled it is because too many couples were split up. Or the woman with the pubic hair on her head had to go back to the circus. No one knows, it will remain a mystery until whenever.
