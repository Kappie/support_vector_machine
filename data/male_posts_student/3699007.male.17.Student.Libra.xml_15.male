As is human nature, my mind began to drift across the past few years of my life, the friends I've made, the friends I've lost, the major events, and all that kind of stuff. I figured it was only appropriate that with the beginning of my senior year just a little over two weeks away, that I take the time to recap my first three years of high school and my opinions on a few things that have happened. This may freak you out, but as many of you know, my memory is hauntingly amazing, so I will probably list some dates on here...LOL. Thinking back to my first day of high school, I was, as I'm pretty sure everybody else that was going to Brookwood for the first time that day was, optimistically terrified. Definitely not the stronger, more mentally developed person I am today, I climbed aboard the bus at 6:35 A.M. and began the journey that would lead to two of the best friendships of my life. The bus was packed, as I was close to the last stop. There was a stereo system on the bus blairing "Genie in a Bottle" by Christina Aguilera. Not a particularly good song, but it kept me awake. I don't remember who I sat with that day on the way to school, and I don't really remember much more about the first day than that. I was amazed at the size of Brookwood, but I never really got lost on that first day. I had memorized the room numbers. Football began soon after, and my first dome game was August 25th, 2001. Brookwood vs. Harrison. We kicked their ass 31-14 and then proceeded to have the worst season Brookwood had ever had under Dave Hunter. However, 8-25-01 is significant in that if I wouldn't have went to that game,my high school experience would have been pretty different. I went with Alex to that game, and following it, we went back to some friends of his parents' house. There were 2 girls there (I'm not listing names). Immediately, I was attracted to one of them. Alex was attracted to the other. He ended up going to homecoming with her freshman year. Through getting to know one of them, I started eating lunch with her and some friends of hers at school. Sitting across from me was a girl named Amie...she had transfered from South and didn't know anyone at Brookwood, except the girl I liked. So, I figured, what the hell, I may as well be friends with her since shewas friends with the girl I liked. I don't even think Amie liked me very much at first. Freshman year, I was admittedly a know-it-all asshole. I didn't really think she was incredibly attractive and throughout the first semester I didn't really think much of her. Then, somehow, she got ahold of my screen name. (This would be a nice time to note to all you dickheads out there who claim you've known her so long that I was the first guy she knew at Brookwood...just wanted to get that out of the way ;-) Anyway, so, December 15, 2001, I am at my grandmother's house on my laptop and Amie IMs me. I sat and talked to her forever, mainly about her friend that I was interested in. We started talking like every day on here for long periods of time and I began to realize that I probably liked her more than her friend. Throughout second semester, I began to like her more. I'm sure she probably figured it out, and I don't really give a damn now because she knows all this. I wouldn't be writing it here if she didn't. Second semester, I started eating lunch with Britt, Katie, Tori, and some other people. I'd kill to have this lunch group again. I laughed my ass off EVERY DAY. I had known Britt in 8th grade because we had eaten lunch together then, but I didn't really know him very well and never saw him as somebody I could really hang out with. He definitely changed from the first few years of middle school. I'm trying to make this somewhat chronilogical, but I'm gonna jump around probably, so whatever. Anyway, on to the summer of 2001. Me and Amie got closer...we basically told each other every secret that we both had. I could ruin her if I wanted to, and she could do the same to me. On to sophomore year. There was nothing good about sophomore year except our football team going to the state championship. Other than that, it utterly sucked in all aspects. I seemed to lose the ability to study, I became frustrated that the girl I was head over heels for didn't seem to know I existed, and I became pretty depressed, and I had to hold it all in. I don't even remember much about sophomore year. The only good thing that came out of it was that me and Britt got a lot closer. January 29, 2003 was one of the worst days of my life. A bunch of crap (that I'm not talking about here)that had built up on me culminated and I had just had enough. My relationship with everyone I knew tumbled from then on. I was so depressed I couldn't think straight. My grades sucked, I felt like nobody gave a damn about me, and I didn't know what to do. In May, I pissed off Amie so bad (something I once thought was impossible) that she stopped talking to me for 4 months. Looking back on it, it was definitely all my fault. I was a jealous dickhead. Over those next 4 months, I got myself back together, got over her, realized that she would always be a much better friend than a girlfriend, and wanted to be friends with her again. (We are moving on to junior year now). Anyway, to make it short, me and her spoke from September of '03 to February of '04 and then went on another 4 month hiatus due to me being a dick again. Ok, now I'll talk about the other aspects of junior year. I loved my junior year...it was definitely the best year I've had of high school. The summer between sophomore and junior years, I really changed. I think the main thing was that I finally got some self confidence. Finally, I felt like I was relatively decent looking and I liked the person I was. I had definitely learned over the first two years that being nice to people was crucial in being friends. Me and Britt had three classes together, so we got really close and started hanging out a lot. He has introduced me to so many awesome people and made me so much more of an outgoing person that I an indebted to him forever. Something happened that I never thought would...I had a lot of friends. People liked me...I didn't feel like I needed to idolize people anymore. I could just be myself and people liked it. It was an amazing feeling. I guess that's about it. If there's one thing I've learned in high school, it's that people change so much. Looking back over the past three years, I have definitely changed a lot, I think for the better. Right now, going into senior year, I love my life. The only thing that sucks that's going on is my grandmother being in the hospital. Me and Amie are friends again, and this time I don't think it's going to end because of some stupid BS...I think we've realized that we appreciate each other too much for it to do so. Ok this has been long and rambling and I hope somebody reads it. Later everyone.
