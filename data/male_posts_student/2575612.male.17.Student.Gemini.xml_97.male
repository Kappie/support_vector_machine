After watching 'Oprah in South Africa' in health class and discussing the epidemic with a Kenyan professor, i have decided that fighting the epidemic in Africa is a not necessarily a "calling" but more of an ambition. i would love to live, work and play in africa; to help the millions of orphans throughout the continent. and to bring comfort and love to the Hiv positive adults and children.   The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilization.  Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882)
