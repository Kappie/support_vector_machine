She was asked by me if she'd come for Saturday's class or Sunday's service. She shook her head and answered inaudibly "no, I'm not coming back" followed by a "can you please leave me alone". I just stood there, stunned. Colin giggled nervously. Went upstairs to cry. What did I do wrong now? Just 2 days ago, she said that things were fine. Distraught.  Ran my 2.4 today. First time I've run 6 rounds in 6 months. Got 11.50. Was happy, but not now.  Met new people today. Some drama, some Media Resource. They're all nice. This girl messaged Feodor like 15 minutes after we left, to ask him to tell me that I was the first real gentleman she'd met in ACJC. I was momentarily flattered, But not now.  I miss Hazel terribly. The silk of her hair. Would you miss me? Maybe I should end it, but not now.
