From wat I see in the list I think I’ve only seen half the ppl in it, it’ll be good to put some faces to those names. And like wat “alternating current” has said, it’ll be good to exchange pointers to all u freshies! Hee..and also to lend support to each other.    Btw I stay in Hall 5, the canteen’s not bad according to first timers, but not for somel like me who have been eating their food for the past 2 years! So give me a ring if u wanna come down and try the food. I can give some recommendations. My no. is 94870708    Cya ard sch! Adios!
