Last night he came out and he had about 3 or 4 beers, and chatted with me, my sister, brian, and my mom. But for about 20 min he talk to me about his new job, and how my resume that I helped him with had gotten him hired, and how he couldn't wait to get on a normal schedule for once!  Tonight however he was a little quieter. He just called and said, "hey bring out a couple of beers. I'll be over in about 10 minutes." So I did as I was told and met him outside with a couple of beers. Only tonight he must have been really tired. He just guzzled his first beer, then belched a few belches that would almost rate on the richter scale. And had asked for his second beer to-go. Then he was off.  I then realized that I had to park my car in the garage still. So I wheeled it around a little and pulled it into the garage. Except it looked as crooked as a politician. So I decided to back it out and re-do it. But you see if you can wheel a car into a garage crooked...you have little luck getting it out safe! So I just about run over the cats, and mow over the garage trying to get my car out. I pull my car into the garage (straight this time). And as I sit here now eating  urlLink Chick-O-Sticks  I wonder if I damaged my car; I wasn't really paying any attention if I hit anything  inside  the frickin garage!!!
