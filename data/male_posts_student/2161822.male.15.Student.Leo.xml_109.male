I'm not really into walking around looking at pots and naked sculptures. And the sad part was we were stuck there for about 4 hours. Bus ride up was routine I guess. Rousing card games a plenty. And I think I have a permanent jalapeno taste in my mouth from about 10 handfuls of flavored seeds. When we got there I had a feeling it would suck. I think I walked around more trying to find the cafeteria and bathrooms more than I actually looked at the artwork. Here we go. First, I get the urge to get something to eat. So we go to the "cafeteria", but all they were selling was like friggin apples and muffins. So I knew it couldn't have been the real cafeteria. So I say "let's look at the sign in the elevator to see where the cafe is". On the elevator, we go up to the second floor, somehow end up back on the first, then go back up to the second, go to the 4th, realize we can't get to the roof on this specific elevator for some reason, go back down to the second, find which elevator WILL take us to the roof, go to the first floor, walk to the elevator, go to the roof, and find another little crap muffin stand. My patience was running dry about now. We finally find the hidden cafeteria by going down a shady step of stairs. Hunger has taken over me by now and I pick up a sandwich and a coke. At least something to hold me over until dinner. I get in line, get my wallet out, and ....wait did I hear that right?! 7.50$ for my turkey sandwich and 2.50 for a Coke?? Now the sandwich was alright, but definately not worth 8 bucks. Plus, a bag of chips was 2.25$ and a cupcake was 3$. Now those prices seem a little high for me. I don't know where you buy potato chips but where I do they're definately not 2.50$ for a little bag. So after I finish my costly meal, we're back out in the museum for a game of hide and seek. Hey, there wasn't anything else to do. So we split up into teams, but realize we have to make rules since Wilson starts booking through the museum for the "base" we never made. Somehow it ends up with 4 people hiding throughout the entire museum and 10 people looking for them. So it starts off well enough until me and Jimmy get sidetracked looking at more important things (*cough* ladies *cough*) Somehow we meet up with Adam and Joe and realize we're not going to find 4 kids in the entire museum. So the search for clean bathrooms began. We walked to one bathroom, went in and took one sniff and left, but then walked around a little bit aimlessly and ended up back at the same restroom. About now we forgot about finding the lost 4 children and continued our search for bathrooms. After that, I guess we were way bored and went outside to watch all of the nice cars pass by. Until it started to rain. And when two guys from a building across the street kept eyeing us up. I found it funny however when a certain person was trying to hit a pigeon with a bottlecap got yelled at by some butch sitting by us. "Why are you throwing crap (PG version of the word she used) at the pigeons? What if I threw something at your head?" As we all just ignore her she keeps going. After our visit to the museum we board the great charter again and head home. I didn't realize it would be an hour before we ate again, so I was starving in the Lincoln Tunnel. I was ready to eat anything. When we finally got to McDonalds I ate like a pig. As I watched my classmates venture through the Play Place. Amusing how they're all way too big and about 100 lbs over the restrictions for the play place. So I was just waiting for Jeff or Wilson to break something. After McDonalds it was just the long stretch home. I was kept occupied by a certain Mike Dejoseph's hilarious prank phone calls. Absolutely hilarious. Somehow listening to random people get called up to participate on a fake country radio "trivathon" never gets old. Especially when they answer questions like "What religion are the Amish?" So that basically sums up the day. Nothing way out of the ordinary, unless you consider wandering through a big mofo of a museum fun. So after this extremely long post, I apologize. But I don't feel bad for the weird girl who enjoys spending hours working on calc homework.  Listen to H.I.M.
