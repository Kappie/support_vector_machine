Deciding to take advantage of this weather, I recalled when my sociology professor from last semester told us about this really nice state park close to Albany that was definitely worth the ride, so I took his word for it, got directions off the internet, and drove there. One thing I noticed is how quickly you can go from urban to rural up here; you only need to go as little as 2 miles west of the city of Albany to find farms and open fields. Well in about 20 minutes I was at the park….it was fucking awesome. The park is at the northernmost tip of the Catskill Mountains and it consists of huge cliffs, waterfalls, lots of caves. At the top of the cliffs there is an awesome view of the Albany skyline, the Adirondacks, Vermont, Massachusetts, and you can even see the towers of UAlbany clearly. I took the trail that pretty much leads right along the edge of the cliffs and takes you under the waterfalls. I’ve been on a lot of hikes before but this one was definitely one of the best. I was also surprised at how many other college kids were there – I’m glad I’m not the ONLY one who enjoys hiking and getting off campus once in a while. Not to mention that hiking really clears your mind…  Tonight I decided NOT to get wasted so instead I hopped in the car and took a random road trip with Zach. We drove all over the fucking place, listened to some good music, and went all the way to Troy to go to “I Love NY Pizza” which has some of the best pizza you can find around Albany. $1 a slice – why can’t they have that in Rockland??? It looked like Troy had some pretty decent bars and clubs too….lots of college kids from RPI and Siena…..kind of like a mini-Albany.  I wish there were more weekends left in the semester to go on more awesome road trips like that. Not ONE drop of alcohol the entire weekend and I had more fun than most weekends!!!  -BIGsmut
