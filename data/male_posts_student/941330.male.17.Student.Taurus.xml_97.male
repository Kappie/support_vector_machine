"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said it was likely the blackout started in the Niagara Falls area and quickly spread." it's always the canadians, isn't it!  now...135 official candidates. FUCK. yes, we are the stupidest state in america. jay leno (who invited all candidates to a sept. 22 taping of his show): "even florida is laughing at us." (a darrell issa shirt: "i spent $1.75 million on this campaign, and all i got was this lousy t-shirt." he's not running.) personally i would have supported richard riordan, but hey arnold would be an interesting change. stupid davis is trying to highlight a vote arnold made in  1994  against rights for illegal immigrants. and all the special interest groups that funded davis's record campaign, and who subsequently were ignored by davis after the election? he's now talking to them again, trying to wheel and deal for their preferred legislation and essentially bribe their constituents' votes. talk about desperation.  ralph nader  urlLink got a pie in the face . woohoo.  davis is supporting a new proposal to rescind the tripling of the state's car tax. breathe easier, those of ye in current possession of those four-wheeled godsends of bliss.    urlLink partial candidate platform list :   Joel Britton:  "I am for a workers' and farmers' government, which will abolish capitalism in the US and join in the worldwide struggle for socialism." (hello basho!)  D. Clements:  "I'm a long shot candidate, but like the horse Seabiscuit, sometimes the long shot can win." (you and the other 125+ long shots)  Warren Farrell:  "Equal father and mother involvement (yea, a governor really can do that)...more male teachers; boy-friendly schools." (yea, cuz going to school is an exercise in torture for boys exclusively.)  Larry Flynt:  "california...would welcome having a smut peddler who cares as their governor." (of course.)  Lorraine (Abner Zurd) Fontanes:  hahaha...abner zurd...  Trek Thunder Kelly:  "I will legalize drugs, gambling and prostitution so they can be taxed and regulated... I don't care who you marry or have sex with." (amen to that. er...)  Jerry Kunzman:  "California has some obvious problems. I have some solutions. I don't have all the answers, but that's what advisers are for." (honesty in politics! finally. jill, you have an opening...)  Bruce Margolin:  "We should teach basic criminal penalties (huh?) and yoga in our schools." (go away.)  Paul Mariano:  "I am the only candidate who will appoint Davis as chief of staff in charge of the day-to-day governance of California." (and you wonder why you're the only one...)  Ronald Jason Palmieri:  "[Do] not waste your vote on those...who will never be elected." (hello, what are you doing on the ballot then? loser.)  Bill Prady:  Promises to end the state's problems "in 22 minutes and 44 seconds." (why not 23 minutes? just to make it even.)  Kevin Richter:  "I breathe." (that's good...the only breathing candidate on the ballot.)   urlLink mike cassidy : A "debate between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gary Coleman? (Jeez, Arnold, don't step on him.) ... (The bad news [about the recall]: When it's over (edit: love that song), we'll still have a governor... [Liberal candidate Ariana] Huffington is an inspiration. She's tired of the corruption of expensive campaigns. She's pledge to hold her spending at [only] $10 million... If Arnold is elected, is he...going to need bodyguards?"  old joke: "on its opening weekend, gigli made less money than nemo, which I think has been out since '88."   urlLink NBC4 TV : "The 911 call Kobe Bryant made the day before he surrendered to police on a sexual assault accusation was 'for medical assistance for his wife,' authorities said." so the tabloids were right for once! wow, the moon is really blue tonight...  six people are setting up camp in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library (the new one in San Jose) to break a Guinness world record by reading over three days straight, nonstop. "The Guinness rules are strict," says the  urlLink San Jose Mercury News : "No more than six people are permitted to read...each for a maximum of three hours at a time. THe pause between readers cannot be longer than 30 seconds. Each member of the team must read, eat, and sleep in the library." my question is, who the fuck cares?  an 18-year-old teenager Kevin Bella is running for Los Altos school board member even though he's attending u.c. davis this fall. yes! that's a perfect way to reform stodgy, antiquated, bureaucratic messes in school boards -- by having a board member who can only be in the city 2 days a month!
