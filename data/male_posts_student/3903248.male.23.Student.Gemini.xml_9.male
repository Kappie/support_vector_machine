So, we decide to go into Tannenbaum first since it's the closest place.  Angela says there is a restaurant down there that has a deck I should be able to get some good pictures on.  This was mistake of the day #1.  First of all, there IS NO RESTAURANT.  At least, not anymore.  It seems that the place was bought and closed SEVERAL years ago.  Yay for my perceptive wife.  So, an hour and a half, a few wrong turns, and many near-death experiences later, we make it back to the highway.  From there we head to Diamond Bluff.  Now, I always assumed Diamond Bluff was some tourist spot with a place to park at the bluffs and take pictures or whatever.  ha.  No.  It's a damn "Restricted" subdivision.  I still got a few decent shots, but the highlight of the entire day was possibly scaring the shit out of some rich bastard that lives on top of the hill in the subdivision.  I won't go any further.  Without further ado, here are the pictures:  urlLink Greers Ferry Trip
