I really wanted to do a web rado station this summer and so did  urlLink Nick , but I really have too much to do and I will when the school year starts again too.  Truthfully, I really don't feel like doing a radio station.  I'm tired all the time, and I really don't like the way getting up at 8 am every day sounds ;-).  Maybe next year?  My Xanga rant is over... In case you didn't know I swiched to  urlLink Xanga  for 2 days.  I deleted all my posts from there and I'm back to Blogger now.  I know I was telling  urlLink Rachel  and  urlLink Jessi   that it was bad, but it's ok I guess -- I still think Blogger beats it ( urlLink so Nick says too ).
