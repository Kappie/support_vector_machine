Most days...I love her, other days (such as the last 2 weeks of my life) I either want to smash something (or someone in that case) or move out as soon as I can because of her. She has made my last to weeks into HELL!She was upset about my girlfriend  my actions. SO she has (at least what it seems to me as) pushed us almost to the brink of ending the whole thing,  if that were to happen, there would be hell to pay for a very very very long time. So for the last 2 weeks: Mom has been mad at me, My girlfriend has been mad at me (off and on), my girlfriends mom is mad about the whole thing,  my brothers are mad at me cuz im mad at them. Then here in the middle are me and my dad... 2 men against 3 women  2 boys, Not even near being fair. Plus im working 2 to 10 every nite every week so im very tired along with this whole deal, not cool.
