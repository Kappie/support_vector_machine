This weather makes me feel like I should either be a) heading to work at A or b) Waiting for Skye to either walk or ride his bike over to my house for a day of lazing around at the beach, looking at women we would never have the guts to actually approach. Hmmm. The joys of summer time. I often think I'd love to move someplace warm, like florida or cali, where it would be like this year round. But then, in the grand scheme of things, I think we all need to go through winters. Times of cold and depression. Isolation and lonliness. We need to experince things like that in order to truly appreciate days like today. It is really beautiful out here.  Last night, it was Clayton's birthday. 19. Jeez. We are getting so old. Anyhow. Amanda is in town as well, so she came, and it was great. We didn't do anything super-special, just went to Bramleys for a bit. Ashlyn, Matt, Clayton, Amanda. Eddie. Miranda. So many memories there. And Nikki. Well, someday I'll be able to look back when I see her and think the same thing, but as for right now, she's just a cool newbie. You learn something new everyday. And last night, I learned something new about myself. I will never be attracted to the "hot girl". Sure, there's plenty of physically attractive girls out there. But the really "hot" ones. Super skinny, super skanky. Tight clothes. No clothes. It just doesn't work for me. The hottest girl at the bar last night wasn't all dressed up special. She was wearing semi-baggy pants and a t-shirt. Hair tied up into a simple ponytail. I think there's tons of guys out there who share the same sentiments as me when it comes to that kind of stuff. Sluttier is not necessarily better. Showing self-respect is also a very important thing.  The other night, I went over to Crystals. I was supposed to help her study, but she didn't feel like it, and there's no arguing with that girl. There never has been. I took her to McDonalds. And we went to Chapters. She wouldn't let me leave the magazine rack for almost an hour while she scoured hair magazines for a picture she had seen earlier. She never did find it. Later, we went for a walk. A walk in the rain. And as the worms crawled out of the ground and into the streets, she told me of her situation. Her current boy situation, things about Mike and Janelle and their situation. Most of it, I found very interesting. We hugged at the end of the night. I miss those hugs.  sI'm looking down my street. Just from what I can see there's 5 houses for sale. One of them is sold. If my parents ever get their shit together, there's supposed to be on in front of my house soon. Every one is moving. Everything is changing.   seasons change with time, feelings come and go
