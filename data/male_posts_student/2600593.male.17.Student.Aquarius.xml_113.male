      I went on quickest planed vacation ever. It took us 30 minutes to say we were going to go, to actually leaving. I went with my aunt and uncle, and my cousins, and a friend.   It took us about 2 hours to get there, and we walk around Gatlinburg for about 3 hour after getting there, even though it rained most of the time. It still was the best time I have had in a while.
