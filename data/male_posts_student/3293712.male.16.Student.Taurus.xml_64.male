Recently saw the movie "50 First Dates" with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. It was pretty funny. It was about Sandler falling in love with a girl (Barrymore) that cannot remember anything from the previous day because of a car accident. She works at a clinic for people with this problem. One of the things that made it funny was all the people from other Sandler movies that show up in it. It was a lot more than usual. Another thing that made it funny were the short memories. For example, this one guy (he has a 10 second memory) who was drawing a picture and says, "What was I doing?"  "You were drawing a picture."  "Oh," and he looks at his picture which is a little stick boy in a beany and says,"Holy shit, I fucking suck." I quit.
