actually has a go most of the time and talks?? haha...total hott euro babe =P kinda like christine.....  had the fattest headache a few hours ago..hadto go sleep it off...  hmm..as i thought...gonna attend a wedding end of this year =D samuel (mah cousin) proposed to audrey during their trip over to china/hk...mum thinks it was in shanghai after he met her parents..hehe anyhooz...this has kinda put me into a lil tight situation >   yea so..sams stuck without a best man for his wedding...mum went church hunting with them today....they found a few nice places in mortdale...so...theyre talking bout this problem..sams got another pretty close friend..but he doesnt know if he'll fly back from the hk to come for the wedding soOOOooo..mum suggested cousin andrew...whos like...20ish...and then audreys like...'hmmm how bout justin' =S i dont even know what samuel thinks bout this > so..i had a chat with the boys...tried to find out what the best mans responsibilities...duties and stuff are...found out they are as follows (there might be more that we dont know bout..if there is..please tell me!!): - making sure the wedding runs without a hitch and to basically take the worrying off the bride and groom - arrange the bachelors party and prepare the grooms stuff for the honeymoon - present the ring - manage the reception...keep the show running - make a speech bout the groom at the 'toast'  seems like alot of stuff to do...well..at least the weddings in december..so got like a month after the hsc to prepare for it... the only thing outta that list i really wanna do is presenting the ring =P im not sure if me..being 17 can shoulder the responsibility of a whole wedding going on..and having to keep everything running...i reckon...alot of people wouldnt even take me seriously and prolly wouldnt even listen... the umm..bachelors party..hmm...im 17...most bachelors parties involve alchie...and that sorta stuff...not gonna be any help there... honeymoon...uh...im barely managing to organise myself..i really doubt that i could manage pigstye samuel hmmm....and making a speech...well...i really dont know samuel that well..well...there was a period that i guess we were kinda pretty close...but hes nearly 30...pretty big age gap if you ask me...he was kinda a big bro to me i guess...haha..baka samuel..thats what wynnie n them call him =/ but..i suck so much at speeches..i reckon i'd say something really sucky > we figured that i'd speak in english for the toast...even if my relos are canto...and audreys relos are mando..and cos my cantos pretty poor..and the fact that i couldnt speak mando to save my own life =/ feels weird making a speech in a language that people prolly wont even understand..  well..theres a few umm...'benefits' being the best man...well..iunno if they turn out to be benefits for me though =S not really benefits..just kinda umm...things that come along with it... - getting to lead the groomsmen - paired up with the maid of honour  lets seee...unless i get to choose my own groomsmen..which is gonan be highly unlikely...i'll be leading round a bunch of 30year old guys that i dont even know..got a feeling thats not gonna work out... oh...partner with the maid of honour..embaressing for both of us >  hmm..i think i gotta work with the maid of honour as well..like arrange everything...  as you can kinda see...im not that confident bout this whole thing...i really dunno if im ready for all this..i thought i would just be attending and taking happy snaps and all..not really expecting something like this...sounds like a lil too much...lotta people gonna be relying on me..lotta pressure gonna be on...lotta stuff that can go wrong...nd..well..even if they get people to help...like the rents and stuff to look over some of the stuff...they still cant help me when i fk up infront of over 100 people can they?? and being me...im sure imma stuff up...always happens..whenever i try or hafto do something..i always seem to stuff up and fk everyone up or do something stupid and embaressing =( and im NOT gonna fk up someone elses wedding...thing is..if samuel does ask me to..umm...it'd be a huge honour?? and..can you really turn down someone like that?? if you knew that they needed you...well...all the guys kinda said that theyd jett if the situation came up...said that theyd make some excuse to worm outta it =S blargh!! iunno what to do..so many issues going round n round n round *dies* >
