However, that is of no comfort to me, writing it was still a bitch.     On the lighter side, Home run derby tonight! woohoo.  but this too is tainted by Rudy T taking the laker's job.  I am hoping deep down that he is trying to screw it to the team that ruined his career by just laying down and throwing every game he can this season.
