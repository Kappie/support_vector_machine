I wish she had her feelings sorted out before telling  me she liked me. Oh well...another failed "relationship." I run through girls toooooo quickly. It's really sad. >_>  There's been some romance sparking between Stephanie and I. :O I really don't want to date anyone though...I'd rather just stay single and flirt with her. That would be better in the long run, and would prevent needless heartbreak.   And I've started liking Sana again for the last month or so...yea............................................................................ god help me. -_-
