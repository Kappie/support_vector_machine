ZZzZzZz|~  The gray sea and the long black land;  And the yellow half-moon large and low;  And the startled little waves that leap  In fiery ringlets from their sleep,  As I gain the cove with pushing prow,  And quench its speed i' the slushy sand.   Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;  Three fields to cross till a farm appears;  A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch  And blue spurt of a lighted match,  And a voice less loud, through its joys and fears,  Than the two hearts beating each to each!  .-=end Here=-.~
