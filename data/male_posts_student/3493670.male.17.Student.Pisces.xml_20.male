I wasn't able to sleep much that night cuz I really had to study and am hell bent to study in UP come 2006. The day wasn't as easy as I imagined it to be.  *Closes eyes for a sec to remember*  I woke up at 7am. I was calling on my mom and asked her for a piece of gonuts donuts. I sorta need sweets in the morning to energize me but she said that there aint anymore donuts. Aaaaaarrrggghhh! So I just took a bath and realized that am fresh out of facial scrub. Oh no! But had no time to buy some cuz I gotta go to school. Had to dress up quickly cuz mom, lolo and my tita were waiting for me. When I was done, we hailed a cab cuz my lolo's having his monthly check up. It was traffic in c5 and I was beginning to lose my patience cuz I might not make it to school and my tita was betting like 500 bucks to prove that I wouldn't make it. *smells impending bomb*  Arrived at Shaw Boulevard at 10 am. Exams end at 12. I have two hours left to travel, study and take the exams. While I was in the FX, I was in a psuedo state of panic already. The driver drives like a snail.  As I reached my stop, I look at my cell to check the time. To my horror, it was already 11am! Waaaaahhh! I'm having this fear that I wouldn't make it. I had to run. As I reached the faculty room, I was praying that my teacher would let me take my exam.  She did.  I had like 15 mins to study. I was hoping not to fail. As I took the exam paper, my heart was pounding. I was scared. I nervously read the questions and to my delight, it aint really that hard. took the exams as fast as I can and left the school with the feeling of weight lifted off my shoulders.  I was waiting for the FX and I suddenly felt my hunger. My stomach was growling! I had half a mind to take the cab but I wouldn't have any money left if I will. So I opted to wait for an FX. 30 excruciating minutes later, an FX arrived. Lets not forget that the FX only reaches Shangri-La. Had to take the MRT to Ayala.  Called up The Grudge to ask her where they are. She said we're having lunch in Jollibee! Yey! I've been hankering for Jollibee's chicken for the past 3 days. As I reached Jollibee Glorietta 4, I faced my tita with a smug smile on my face. I told her that yes, I took the exams and passed it! She was rather speechless. She couldn't say anything. As I asked her for the 500 bet, she said nothing. Sorta saw that coming though.  It was already 2pm, I had to go to PSbank Arnaiz branch to get my mom's new checkbook. There's no jeep from Glorietta to PSbank Arnaiz, so I had to walk... again. As I reached PSbank, I asked Lisa Or Spencer about my mom's checkbook. They said that they couldn't give me the checkbook without an authorization letter from my mom. I called home and my mom spoke to the bank personnel, but they still need the goddamn authorization letter. So I had no choice but to go my house in Makati to get my mom to make an authorization letter. As the authorization letter was finished, she said something so shocking, it sent shivers down my spine. She invited Peloy to come over on the 17th! I was shocked! I bursted into tears! I was sooooo damn happy! I was at my wit's end and expending the remnants of my energy. But with that statement, I was re energized!  Had to run back to PSbank and slap those people with my authorization letter. As I received it, I had to run back home to give it to my mom. As I was making my way home, I was making a list of things I gotta buy before I head to UP Diliman. I gave the checkbook to my mom and kissed her goodbye.  As I hailed a jeepney to go to glorietta, I received a txt message coming from Peloy and he was pretty disappointed. And the cause was that Motherfucking UP @$$#0LE! I swear! If I can only kill without even the slightest tinge of guilt, I would've done it already (Imagines the cold and sharp blade of the samurai sword swiftly slicing UP @$$#0LE$' neck). So I went to SM makati to buy Massage oil, a chocolate bar and my bowtie *wink wink* and made my way to UP.  I boarded the MRT, I noticed a screaming fag in his 40's naughtily smiling at me. I showed him nothing but a sarcastic look at screams (leave me alone  punyeta!  I am not at all interested). As the MRT reached the ortigas station, I got pushed my a guy by accident and as a result, I dropped my phone and the housing cracked. Jesus Christ! Fortunately, Tim was txting me and keeping me company as I endure the excruciating trip from MRT Ayala station to Quezon Ave.  As I reached the Quezon Ave station, I asked for directions as to where I can find the UP Pantranco jeep. Someone was kind enough to take me there. I boarded the jeep and made my way to UP. I stopped at Sunken Garden. As I was walking across Sunken Garden, my shoes we're sinking in the puddle of mud and my slacks we're having mud stains already. Aaarrrggh! And then, I saw Peloy. I waved at him. He waved back. As I made my way up to see him, he was in his new shirt and all i could mentally say was *Yowza*! Hehehehe!  As I met Peloy, I txted Tim to say that I was already in Sunken Garden. He arrived in less than 3 minutes. Tim and Peloy we're talking about UP stuff. Suddenly, I was lost. Heyyyy! I'm not from UP guys! Well, at least not yet. Hehehe! Suddenly, Peloy mentioned the name of UP @$$#0LE again. It pisses me off! I really have nothing but sheer and utter contempt for that guy. I just wish that UP @$$#0LE will die before I even get to UP.  I gave Peloy the chocolate and gave him a back massage. Later, we were talking about how we fell in love with each other and how much we truly love each other. The comfort and security his presence brings is just overwhelming. Time stops when I am with him.  Later that night, we bought Chickenjoy in Jollibee Kamias and I made my way back to Glorietta by taking the bus.  As I reached glorietta, I asked my mom if we can go to McDonald's Greenbelt to buy food. I can't buy food anywhere cuz it's already 11pm. So we hailed a cab and ordered through drive thru. I had my buffalo chicken Mcdo. Its pretty good! I had to go home to eat it cuz it's drenched in sauce and eating it in the cab would be messy. I had my dinner at home and went online only to read Peloy's blog.  I had to go home cause I want to hear Peloy's voice before we both sleep. He called up to say goodnight and exchanged I love You's *Awwwwww* It still gives me the butterflies. I do love him that much.  Looking forward to more of this as time passes by.  I love you Peloy.
