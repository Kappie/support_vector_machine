I am sad to have to re-enter hum drum everydayness, I rather like the exaulted plane people are in during the first flush of attraction. Well, now to building something up under that. Last week went something like this: Two lovers, mindless of their surrounding, walk along the street in a bubble of happiness. Suddenly they both look up and see the snow fall down like a curtain of whiteness, they grab hands and laugh in perfect synchronization at the beauty of the world. For a brief moment they feel like one person. Later, in the bar, their conversation is the only thing that seems real. All their friends recede into the distance, like a video played at a party as background noise. They nudge and touch and lean into each other--It is physically impossible not to touch. They are happy, and somewhat gone from this world.
