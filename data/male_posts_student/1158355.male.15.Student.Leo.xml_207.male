Ok last night was great, I asked out Alyssa (Keith's girlfriend, Heather's friend) and we're going out. I love you Alyssa. Nothing else besides Alyssa...Alyssa...Alyssa...Alyssa...yea you get the point. Today I was gone all day, god knows where I don't even remember. All I remember was alot of drumming. Oh yea Easter was great. My mom makes so spoiled though, she got me and dvd and a game! That's like 60 bucks! Hey not my fault I'm spoiled. I got Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes and RUSH IN  RIO! Jesus that's the best concert I've ever seen. I'm too obsessed with them but they are so good, so unique, all their songs so catchy, it's crazy. Ok so that's it. Bed time...then school. Bye.   Check  urlLink this  out, it makes you think, the superior is watching us. The Matrix...or something similiar to it. Also saw some really funny pics with that pic all of you have seen with the tourist guy on top of the twin tower with the plane coming...well he was basically in the picture of every human disaster dating back to Hindenburg and Titanic...and the matrix!  urlLink This  is awesome also...remember that huge black out we had?   "A quantum leap forward in time and in space. The universe learned to expand." - Rush You know what's great about Rush, Neil Peart writes the lyrics and Geddy sings them, Alex too. Neil is a scientific genius, who has a dramatic life, and writes lyrics about weird stories and science and all. He's also one of my idols.
