First semester I've got Cobined studies, latin 1 and band, and second I have geometry, chemistry, latin 2 and band. Life just keeps getting more and more boring.....not much to type about. To keep you guys occupied, here is a poem written by Matthew Ayers, it makes no sense to me, but he sent it to me forever ago to print out for him so he could have it at school the next day.   After committing the sexcrime, all I can do is think of you. You are doubleplus beautiful. I am fullwise in love with you. I bellyfeel the thought crimes I commit will surely get me killed. I thought strongly of throwing this poem in the memory  hole to escape the ungood consequences. If I get vaporized and become an unperson please donâ€™t  forget me.    Love, Me  Now wasn't that inspiring? Time for the quote of the day.  Quote of the Day: While talking about fast food rules and regulations, Daniel Ponder said,(I think he was trying to be funny but I'm not sure), "Don't put the fat in the oil!"                                                         Man, this guy is coo.....
