I work in the Dan Beard program, which consists of teaching the youngest of Boy Scouts a healthy portion of requirements needed to rapidly advance.  My co-workers in this field are Edelman, Sodl, Mark, and Jesse, all of whom are nice guys.  DSL (bleh) hook-up is happening as I speak, so I should be able to post from camp in the near future.
