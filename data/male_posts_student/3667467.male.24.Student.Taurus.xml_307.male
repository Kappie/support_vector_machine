This would almost seem normal if A) we were a couple, B) we were of opposite genders, and C) we lived in the same household. Instead, we live 1000 miles away. So here we sit typing away on Instant Messenger about what we're going to watch next so we can discuss it, and then we get into an argument about whether a certain show is funny or how we forced the other person to watch OUR show last week and should return the favor. We might need counseling. In other news, today I visited downtown Lancaster, New York for the first time today. In the words of Dr. Robert Butler, I had a firsthand experience of the quintessential articulation of mid-20th century Americana. Fascinating.
