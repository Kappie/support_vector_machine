Here she is emailling me with a question on weither she should change what county she is working in so we can find an apt together.  What the muthr F!!!  If you havent talked to someone in over a month wouldnt you get the hit that either they didnt want to talk to you or that things are over.  Well then again I know who I am talking about and it usual takes about me telling her something about Six or seven times to actually hear it, not understand it but hear it.  SO I am going to go out tonight and get some wings and shoots lots of pool.  I am really trying my hardest not to really get mad.  Casue you wouldnt like me when Im angry.   czech U l8r
