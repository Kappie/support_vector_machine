Because, literally. The best description for some of these people (without trying to be racist) was "Texan". Aaaaaanyways.  Today was tiring. Get up. Work. Get back. Go play tennis. Get back. Do bugger all recovering. *yaaay*  And the next time Mr d'Attenhoven calls for more art, I may have to restrain myself from branding the words "I'm busy, you ass" onto his forehead. Or maybe the Belglish version: "I,m biesee, yu asch///"  Oh well. Got till friday till next exam. So plenty of  "study" .  NOW WITH ADDED SARCASM!!!
