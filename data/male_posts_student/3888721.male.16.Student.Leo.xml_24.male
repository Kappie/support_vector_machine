Steal from a canteen vendor, and got caught doing it, man...its his lucky day. Lessons was as usual, nothing much happened. After school actually intended to go study with bing rong, but then the study place quite far, so i decided to stay back and attended E.P. I think that Ms Jazilah is a solid chem pro, her notes are all easy to understand and she explained all the complicated things in an easy manner, no wonder she is a former recipient of the Marist Teacher Of The Year. After school i went to eat mac with Goh wei cong. It was quite funny, an old lady suddenly ask him to look after her bag while she go order her food. Wei Cong was definitely shocked and gave that "fuck off understand" face. The whole situation was damn funny and i laughed throughout our meal. Anyway, return home after that, did a bit of maths before taking a nap. When awoken by mother to eat dinner, i hastily wore a singlet and went out. On the car, i was told we were going to Yohan(Upper Thompson there i think) to buy some kitchen stuff for our house, and i was dressed in shorts and singlet. Luckily, it was quite late by the time i reached there and there were not many people around, but it was quite cool walking around shopping centre in singlet and shorts. After that went to eat chicken rice, and i must say it was one of the best i had eaten so far. The chicken simply melted in my mouth and i don't even remember chewing. The feeling was damn shiok. On the way home, i saw a sort of those 3-storey house, and on their porch, there was a vending machine. What the hell is a vending machine doing in the house man, it definitely caught my eye. I just returned home, so yup, going to study now...
