A dying rose, A hopeless cry, A falling leaf, A blackened sky, A sudden releif A drop of blood A deafening silence... Brings a veil of loss Confirming the certainty Releasing those demons from your soul Allowing time to forget you So this is it- End. So this is all- End. So you wanted to die- End. Beautiful one, always the happy one, You can't avoid the darkness falling Across you now You can't ignore the bitter cold Overwhelming you now Because now there is nothing left, No one is there Its all there is but it was  Gone long ago.  Hope you liked it. If you didn't then you're smart enough to know I'm a worthless piece of shit that no one loves. I will be forevermore the boy that no one loves.
