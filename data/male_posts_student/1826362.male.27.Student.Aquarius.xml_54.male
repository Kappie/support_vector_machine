It wasn't lemony (snicket) enough, and had a mediciney (tnicket) taste to it, like when you open up a packet of sweet and low and taste it by itself.  but recently, i don't know if they have changed the formula, or if i have killed enough taste buds or brain cells since i first tried it, i can't get enough of the stuff now.  So much so that when I drank a bottle of regular diet coke this afternoon, i was surprised that it wasn't lemon flavored.  wierd, huh?
