It's set to be released on September 21, 2004 in a special four-disc set. Star Wars geeks everywhere have already found something to complain about: the possibility that the original theatrical versions would not be released. Lucasfilm has quickly appeased them, though, by agreeing to realease those as well. This would make the  urlLink star wars kid  proud.     The Star Wars Trilogy:    urlLink Episode IV: A New Hope     urlLink Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back     urlLink Episode VI: Return of the Jedi
