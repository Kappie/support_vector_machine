I didn't even have a computer back then!  Anyways, I got bored so I decided to alter the post time of this one. Weird eh? I can even make it post way into the future! It's good stuff. Like a reminder type thing.   This one has no point, and I don't know why you can even post in the past. But for you  Colin's Life  freaks, let's see if you can find this one.  Talk to you all later.
