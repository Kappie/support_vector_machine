Personally, I wish we could talk about taxes and the like the rest of the school year, instead of do this project!  Has anyone started writing their "Describe Yourself" essay for the applications?  I did, it took me 45 minutes to write the first two paragraphs.  So muych pressure - those things have to be PERFECT!  Well, anyway in the end I'm going to be very thankful to Ms. Clark for making us do this stuff now, not in the midst of Senior year!
