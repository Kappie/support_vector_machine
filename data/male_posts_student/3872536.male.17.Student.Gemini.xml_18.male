The big5 thing looks like another set of lecture notes lor hehe,  Then today had eclub meeting. Initially we are supposed to haf a debrief by Mr Chiang de but he didn't turn up. So ended up doing nuthing except for the subway duty ding.  Then get to speak to the club regarding the trip to suntec for some toks. As usual, no one went. Is it tat i'm not tat persuading enuff lol.  Before going home, get 2 subway sandwiches 4 free coz today sales damn bad bcoz periods shift in front.  Then help Pei Ching prepare the speech or rather the advertisement for subway on friday. Haf to get it done today coz haf to gain the approval from the Mr Tong or the VP by scanning thr it.  Tat's all...
