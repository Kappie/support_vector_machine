After getting out of the car and walking along a path for a while, they discover an open-air restaurant filled with food but with no workers or customers present. Mom and Dad don't hesitate to sit down and dig in, but Chihiro senses danger and refuses. As night falls, she is terrified to see the area fill with faceless spirits, but when she runs to find her parents, she discovers that they have been turned into pigs. She is found by a mysterious boy named Haku, who promises to help her. He gets her a job working in a nearby building, which turns out to be a spa hotel for the thousands of Japan's gods and spirits. Though the work is hard and the people strange, she does as well as she can. Her parents, however, are still waiting in the hotel's stockyard, and Chihiro must find a way to break the spell on them before they end up as the main course of some guest's dinner."  Visually stunning movie. Groundbreaking cintematic animation which will leave viewers breathless. However, this movie had a few minor problems found in the plot. When watching a film, viewers should connect with the characters and story.  This component was lacking throughout "Spirited Away."  Frequently during the extent of this movie, I felt that many scenes were made precisely to add beauty and appeal.  This made it increasingly hard to understand the characters and storyline. Nevertheless, good visual watch for adults and children alike.  Rated PG for some scary moments. Runtime: 125 min
