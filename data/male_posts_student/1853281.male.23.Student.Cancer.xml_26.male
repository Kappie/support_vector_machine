But on the upside i did get one half price because the server decided i should be included in the ladies night special at the Tower.  Nightclass, interesting yet dry. Kinda standard upper level real academia focused class. Interesting though. I like it. I can see allready though, that i am going to be living at Bob's and maybe Spyhouse studying. I have a grand total of 7 papers to write this semester, along with presentations, reflections, debates, and a hefty dose of daily reading. Actually when i write it out it does not seem so much. But i will be busy enough.
