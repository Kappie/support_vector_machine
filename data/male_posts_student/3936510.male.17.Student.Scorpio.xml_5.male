I am really excited and cant wait to get the season started. It's going to be so much fun. I think...Craig is kind of getting on my nerves. He makes me feel like he is making me feel like shit. If that makes sence. lol Like he goes to the guard and percussion practices. I dont know why dont ask me. There is really no reason for him too. He tells me "Why dont you go?" Sry Craig...I have a life outside of band. Like home, school, and a job.          Why do I like so many people. There are so many guys (even gurls) that I like. I mean not like I want to be serious w/ them. But, maybe a date or 2 w/ them. That would be so much fun. I need to date too. I need to get out and meet new people. This one guy Dan. AH! Awesome guy.     Funny    Good Looking/Hot  Great Personality   Definately someone I would like to get more involved w/. He lives in Canada though. lol I know! I know! I want to try and go see him sometime soon. Hell! We have our life spaned out too. We talk about and all. We faught about where we would live. I want to stay in the states. He wants to stay in Canada. lol It is so much fun to talk to him.     I cant wait to start back @ Steak n' Shake. It's going to be so much fun. I love working there. I dont know why I quite in the first place.     I told Justin I would put this pic on my journal. Dont worry guys, he's str8. Were just good friends. It is a hot pic though.
