It's all messy and looks like model hair... God, I sound like such a girl in this blog. Someone needs to kick me in the nuts to make sure they're still there... DERP!  So I've managed to shrink down to 137lbs now. Still I feel kind of chunky, but my sense of logic is telling me that's impossible, being 5' 6" (d'oh!) and having this big, mellon head of mine. I'm certainly not lanky, even for my height. I've come to think that while my chest is large, the majority of it's size is due to the structure of my rib cage, which is probably larger than usual due to my unusualy deep voice (which I've noticed today is getting deeper, and considering I'm done growing, and not twelve fucking years old, that shouldn't happen... I also noticed that it's changed a little to sound like I've smoked a lot and drank a lot of whiskey. idk). I think I'm starting to get a starvation belly from only eating one meal a day. Yay, now I'll look like an Etheopian.... I need to start jogging... wait... fuck that. I'll just buy some cutting gel. --- enough girlieness Well I'm back at the bookstore (Widener University School of Law campus Bookstore, Wilmington, DE) for work this summer. I think that makes 6 years now. It's really a great job. I come in at 11am and if we don't have a shipment coming in I just hang around, read on the leather couch or in the shady courtyard, and get paid for nothing. The people I work with are all fantastic, crazy, blue-collar Americans-- a great lot. When I'm working I'm usually unloading truckloads of books (thousands and thousands of them... Books, not trucks.) on huge palats, in massive 80lb boxes, in the summer heat-- it's a great workout. There are lots of perks to working at the bookstore. Ever August, before classes start, we get crates of "Campus Trial Packs" filled with studious amenities, like candy, gum, Nyquil, Dayquil, Shampoo, Deoderant, Combos, tampons, and condoms-- everything a college boy/girl needs (I can get you a box too, so let me know if you want one. We just give the shit away so it doesn't matter that I take whole crates.. This offer stands unless an assload of people ask me) Of course, I always take at least one case of 75 trial packs... I haven't bought deoderant in at least 2 years, and if I take any more I'll have a lifetime supply of condoms (considering I'll probably never get much sex... actually, I think the 70-something I have now will serve as my lifetime supply... Or as my pal Dave Gardener told me; "Now you can jerk off without making a mess!" Sadly, he's probably right and that's probably the only use these little fuckers'll see)  right... I'll be back later with other boring shit
