Did you know that those who appear to be very strong in heart are real weaklings and most susceptible?     Did you know that those who spend their time protecting others are the ones that really need some one to protect them?     Did you know that the three most difficult things to say are : I love you, Sorry and help me The people who say these are that actually need them or really feel them, and are the ones you really need to treasure, because they have said them.       Did you know that people who occupy themselves by keeping others company or helping others are the ones that actually need your company and help?     Did you know that those who dress in red have more confidence in themselves?     Did you know that those who dress in yellow are those that enjoy their beauty?     Did you know that those who dress in black are those who want to be unnoticed and need your help and understanding?     Did you know that when you help someone, the help is returned in two folds?     Did you know that those who need more of you are those that not mention it to you?       Did you know that it's easier to say what you feel in writing than saying it to someone in the face? But did you know that it has more value when you say it in the face?     Did you know that what is most difficult for you to say or do is much more valuable than anything that is valuable that you can buy with money?     Did you know that if you ask for something in faith, your wishes are granted?     Did you know that you can make your dreams come true, like falling in love, becoming rich, staying healthy, if you ask for it by faith, and if you really knew, you'd be surprised by what you could do.       But don't believe everything I tell you, until you try it for yourself , if you know someone that is in need of something that I mentioned of, and you know that you can help, youâ€™ll see that it will be returned in two folds.     DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON ME???... AT THE MOMENT, TIME AND PLACE THAT YOU NEED ME, CALL ME, I WILL BE THERE WITH YOU !!!!!
