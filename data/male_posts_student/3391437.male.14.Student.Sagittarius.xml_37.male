Rollins has made more than a billion dollars by selling books and movies. “Why is Harry Potter the best book ever?” This question is very hard to answer because it really doesn’t have an answer in my opinion. This is why because I have never have decided to read any book in my life. A very surprising thing you might think. I only have read book if they promise me good grade or if it is a requirement. In other words, I only read what I have to read. But, I am gathered some information about why other people think Harry Potter is the best book. Some say that when you read the book you feel like you are actually experiencing what you are reading. Many people told me that the book makes the reader feel as actually he is there. I tried reading the first 3 pages, hake I didn’t feel anything. Harry Potter is just a joke, just a way to make another billion. J.K. Rollins wants to rip us apart.
