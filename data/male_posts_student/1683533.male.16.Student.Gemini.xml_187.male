Well, Mr. Bill is our bus driver, and I must say he is the coolest bus driver I have had.  He is a black dude, and he doesn't act all ghetto.  He sometimes brings us food cause we are good, and one time he let me try these cheese pringle things and I said I liked them and a week later he gave me like a full pack of them.  He talks to us on the ride home, but I am usually listening to music though.  However, I listened today.  He was talking about how when he was on one of his tougher routes, a boy said that he wanted sex from a girl, and she said something like c'mere boy and I will show you what is coming for you, and so he got up and Mr. Bill said he heard a click and he knew she had a knife, and he decided not to do anything.  He says that if a guy touches a girl and it isnt wanted and he has a warning she has every right to "stick him" (cut him up).  And I like that philosophy.  His sister got raped I guess, so now he is really defendent of girls, and he is very respectful towards them I noticed even before this incident.  He said rape is probably the worst thing you could ever do to a lady and any man that even thinks about that has something wrong with him and Mr. Bill is right.  Anyways, the boy backed off, and the girl thanked Mr. Bill not for intervening but she would have "stuck him" if he touched her.  Some guys are just assholes.  I dont like those touchy feely types, that go around hugging every girl they see, and when I ask them for one they get this weird look on their face.  I thought they were friendly that's all, so then I know what they are really up to.  Her are some summer movies I wanna see:  Shrek 2, might see that this week  That dodgeball movie with ben stiller, that looks hilarious  Alexander- movie based on Alexander the great, featuring Colin Farrel (good actor from such movies as SWAT, The Recruit and Phone Booth) as Alexander.  Also features Angelino Jolie and a couple other peoples  Troy- I dunno if I will get around to seeing it.  If any of you people have seen it or have an opinion on these feel free to comment.  I got to unload the dishwasher. bye
