What I like about Blogger is the fact that the templates look so much better, and its easier to use.    Anyway, before I continue to talk about that sounding like the world's biggest computer nerd, you may be wondering.  Bagel?  What the crap!?  Alright, my last name (Weigle), and Bagel rhyme, and, up until now, I've hated being called Bagel.  But, now, I've kind of opened up to the fact that its actually not bad of a nickname.  So I'm just gonna go with it from here on out.    Anyway, its summer break, and boy, I couldn't be more bored.  I'm stuck taking drivers ed last week and this week, with a teacher who couldn't be more annoying if he didn't say "you got that" a hundred times a day.  It's cool though, some of my friends are in there, so it reduces the amount of boredism that comes with being in that class.  We take two tests a day in there, and we move at a really fast pace, which is something I'm not used to.  After I get done here, I'm going to be traveling around the country for two weeks, after I make a quick pit stop to Universal Studios to check out Revenge of the Mummy (which is hopefully going to be this Friday).    A little more about me: I'm 16, almost 17, and I'm going into my senior year in high school.  It's really hard to believe that the past 13 years have gone by so fast, especially after moving around so much.  In the past 13 years, I have been in 5 different places, and, oddly enough, I've stayed here in The River for the second longest, after I half expected to be here for about a year or so and then move again.  I plan to major in journalism in college, possibly minor in teaching, just in case I decide to become an English teacher or something.  And, of course, my hobbies include videogames, photography, and computers.  Yes, I am a nerd, and I'll just go ahead and admit it.  Alright, that's enough for my introduction post.  I will try to update this thing here about twice a week, starting this week, except for when I'm out of town, because, those two painful weeks I will probably be computer-less.  Oh well.    -David-
