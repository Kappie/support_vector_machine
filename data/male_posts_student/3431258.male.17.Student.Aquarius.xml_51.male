We went back home and had diner , pizza was great.   Spoke with some peoples on  msn , played a game of  Homeworld II  and watched that daddy movie with  Adam Sandler , i never remember the title. It sure was an awesome movie as well.   Spoke with  Gustavo  about some girls. Had a talk with  Julien  about what we will do in  Canada , a lot of stuff i hope.   Also visited some new sites, a drawer/painter/photographer named  Beksinski , a true genius as you can see on the pretty picture. I got a link to the author of the music on his websites. The guy name is  Zbigniew Preisner . The kind of music like i have never seen. Well actually i think i did, some kind of instrumental music, but in a sad way. I love it.   Well, i'm tired to death and my father will upgrade internet! Better get some sleep now.  Regards,  Zephyr
