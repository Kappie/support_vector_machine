I guess life never offers us second chances... Are things really beyond our control? I've tried to sort a lotta things but all come back really mucked up. Loosing faith in him ... I believe in him. I guess the way I've been brought up is to believe in him, but its ok to question some of the things that "imposes" on us, but at the end of the day still pray and trust out the judgements that he dolls out so graciously on us.   My food reserve is down to the minimum. Guess there ain’t enough to eat .Have to save up to go back home. Have just enough to pay my rent and buy a ticket home. Lol nothing would be left to eat.   Still trying to figure out how many friends i have. Still trying to figure out how to start living again. May be this time I won’t care for anyone.   I think I’ll go meet the counselor again, at least its some one to speak to. Someone real, I don’t expect him to understand anything; it’s just my way of sorting things out in my life. Still remember going to Dave’s house, just sitting there and asking him a whole lot of questions, he'd have answers to some of them, to others we'd just find an amiable solution. I guess he’s not Dave , he's a 50+ year old man, while flowing beard, kinda reminds me of Gandalf the Grey (except his beard not that long as i imagined it to be)[ notIan McKellen ]  Where am I heading? All seems so lost and bleak. It’s worse than the British winter. Summer wasn’t meant to be such, but in my case, my real winter is happening during a Britishsummer.    Song : Eyes of a Stranger    Artist : Queensryche      Is this all that's left Of my life before me Straight jacket memories, sedative highs No happy ending like they've always promised There's got to be something left for me And I raise my head and stare Into the eyes of a stranger I've always known that the mirror never lies People always turn away From the eyes of a stranger Afraid to know what Lies behind the stare {Lies behind my stare}
