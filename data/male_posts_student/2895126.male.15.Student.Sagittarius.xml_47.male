They each ordered a vodka on the rocks. Brad downed his and ordered another. He then drank his second in a gulp and decided to wait before he ordered a third. Meanwhile, Dave, who was sipping his drink, suddenly fell forward dead. Both men were setup for an assassination. Why did Dave die and Brad live?    Leave your answer as a comment. Think about it.   I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.  (Galileo Galilei)
