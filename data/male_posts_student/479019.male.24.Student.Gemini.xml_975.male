One especially stupid one called another guy a "muslim worm" today... this same customer said Bustamante (a California Democrat) sucks because he caters for the poor, and plans on voting for Bush. That comment was uncalled for, much less the threats of violence... just for knocking on a bathroom door. The fucker deserves a reality check, as he's someone who doesn't seem to work and hangs out the beach ordering $3 drinks everyday. I plan on giving him decaf in the future so he chills the fuck out.  ***
