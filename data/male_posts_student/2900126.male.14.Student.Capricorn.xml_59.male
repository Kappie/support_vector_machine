Some people have a passion for knowledge and that drives them to stay in school, work hard, and pursue their dreams. Other people are passionate for other things, they can be unique things or they can be normal things but whatever drives a person is what keeps them going. Like Chichi wants to be an artist and she does. LinZ wants to be an actress and she loves to dance and she's always in drama and she even works in a theatre to help little kids out and usher for their plays. Most of the time if you don't know what you want out of life it will soon come to you and then you will become passionate for the thing and work hard so you can get it.    Love is another subject. Some people that have families will do anything and I mean anything to keep them safe. Even if it seems like your parents don't love you they would probably do anything for you because of that love that they have for you. Most kids think that their parents don't care about them because their parents don't spend that much time with them, even if your parents don't spend that much time with you they would probably do anything to protect for from harm.   I really have no idea why I chose to write about this, I just wanted to post. ^_^
