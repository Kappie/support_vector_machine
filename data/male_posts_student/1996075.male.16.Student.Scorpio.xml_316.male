A seven nation army couldn't hold me back.  They're gonna rip it off.  Takin' their time right behind my back.  And I'm talkin to myself at night, bcause I cant forget.  Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette   And a message come from my eyes, says leave it alone.   Dont wanna hear about it.  Every single ones got a story to tell.  Everyone knows about it.  From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell.  And if I catch you comin back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you.  And that aiin't what you want to hear, but thats what I'll do.   And a feelin' comin from my bones, says find a home.   Im goin' to Witchita.  Far from this opera forever more.  Im gonna work the straw.  Make the sweat drip out of every pore.  And I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and Im bleedin' right before my lord.  All the words are gonna bleed from me, and I will think no more.   And the stains comin from my blood, tell me go back home   i made a decision yay... :) ...hooray (eventual) decisiveness  ~mOoLaU~
