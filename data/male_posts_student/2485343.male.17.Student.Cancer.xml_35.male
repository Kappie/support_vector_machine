This must be the kind of boredom that the dead feel. I need to get out, to do something. Maybe I will run. Yeah that's it, run just run my ass off. Perspire this feeling away. That's it.   urlLink Charlie   I guess you can say that I have had this feeling for more than two years now. I run, but metaphorically. I cant escape what is consuming me everyday, I guess this is what happens when you have nothing to look forward to but work or school.   Baseball starts tomorrow and I'm so excited, I cant wait to do something. I golf every second of the day when I can and now this will consume me and drive me to do well in school. Its gonna be great.  I also think about the time that is left in the school year. My brother is attending his last ever pitching lesson with the great Wayne Doland. He is sad about it, I think he is gonna miss it very badly. He lives baseball all year 'round. Spring and summer is actual baseball playing. Fall and winter is off season training and pitching clinics and hitting clinics. I don't know what he is gonna do. I think he will sleep all too much. Last year in September was the first time he has slept in on a Saturday. He hasn't since his freshmen year.  KD is the coolest person you will ever talk to. I will give her a shout out right now. I have hopes.
