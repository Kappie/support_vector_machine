SO makeing a trip into Corner Brook with  Chris O last night we went to Wal-Mart to get the DVD but when we got there they had no copies of it, it never came in. So I thought to myself where else in Corner Brook would carry this DVD? Then I thought of the place Dominion yes I know a grocerary store but they do have a great electronics section that gets in new releases and usually at cheaper prices then Wal-Mart. So I went over and yes I got it for just under $17.00 and yay! Its the best DVD ever so funny! Yeup also yesterday I watched both Lord of the Ring Movies the first 2 they were better then I expected. I will soon rent Return of the Kings the third and final movie in that trilogy. Also Dustin yesterday asked me to write a "Letter of Reccomendation" on why he should win a award on his Duct Tape Wallets product which is cool. Well thats all I have to talk about for today. Until next entry.
