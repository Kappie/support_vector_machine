Yes, I realize Sue's a name >_>         Aaanyway, my life has reached its all-time high!!  BOOYA!!  Not really, though.  The days I didn't update were...average.  I finally finished painting my friend's porch!  Woohoo!          I learned a valuable lesson today.  Cats cannot use lotion.  If you try to make them, they bite you.  *nods*  ^^          Baibai!!  *waves*          RFQD:      Jamie:   WHEN THE GARBAGE MONKEY THROWS YOU INTO A RADIOACTIVE MUFFIN, DON'T COME BARKING TO A DECAPITATED SALESMAN!!      Me:   ....What the hell are you talking about?!      Jamie:   Oh...sorry...Thought I saw Richard Simmons over there....      Me:   Since when does Richard Simmons have to worry about garbage monkies?      Jamie:   Since I said that last sentence!!      Me:   Oooohhhh....Did you forget your medication?      Jamie:   I kinda left it at home *smiles sweetly*
