I was playing Prince of Persia-Sands of Time and was very impressed by the fact that all the little intricacies of gameplay (Like the crumbling ledges) in the original Prince game have not only retained their place, but also look more awesome in their 3D rendering.   I am also looking forward to what the id guys have done to the original doom models, I am getting geared up to beat the crap out of their true 3D versions :)).   urlLink Slashdot | Videogame Graphic Advances - Not That Important?
