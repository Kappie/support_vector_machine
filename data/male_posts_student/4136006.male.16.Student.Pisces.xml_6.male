FUCKING FAR AWAY. lets say 4 hrs away. it was at a bowling alley. it was alright, they had a 30 thousand dollar PA, but they had it on the setting for the last band. all the horns got cordless mics, EXCEPT FOR ME! wtf! but thats ok. we werent that tight musically and we sounded a little out of tune. but all in all it was a decent show. we met another band thats cool, and we realized the hijinx is really cool. bowling was fun, thought i didnt do too good, which is surprising because usually i do, do good. the ride home was long, but we got through it with jeff on the walk talkies, screaming things. and when we reached mikes house, we played texas hold em all through the night. i didnt get more than a minute of sleep. and....we ate food at mikes, and stuff. so then my dad comes(now saturday) and picks me up, i get in the car. i remmeber that i have to go to some religious thing... i get home, shower, eat, leave to religous thing, i fall asleep at total of 7 times during it. my dad counted for me. but its ok, cause i can get through most things sleeping. once i get home i just go to sleep and sleep all fucking day. like 16 hours or something. in the morning (sunday) i wake up and realize shit no one is home. i have to go to mikes, cause we have a show at bloomfield. and yahtee yahtee yahtaa. i end up being picked up by cara and mike. and we go to mikes. and pack up the cars with all our shit     and go for the hour long drive to bloomfield. alright ill finish this up later, in a new post. dont wanna type about the past anymore. its water under the bridge, but ill leave you with one word about the bloomfield show. STUPENDOUS!
