Jenna didn't say anything yet, so I assume she still hates me, or just would prefer to live without me, so whatever, that's done. I'm gonna try to get over her, seeing as she obviously will never come back feeling the way she did.      Was 'sposed to call Lindsey like two days ago, but I haven't, cuz I've been busy. Went to Maitland one day, to move Yvan's deck, then to the Rennick reuinion thing yesturday with my mom. I kinda like having shit to do cuz it keeps my mind off of other things, that I really dont need to be thinking about. I'll try to remember to call Linds today though... I'm hopin to set somethin up to hang out with her, cuz I wanna know if something could ever happen. Maybe kiss her or summit... I'd like to. She's been my near #1 laydee for over a year, so it'd be nice to be abe to show it.      I'ma get my guitar's re-strung today if we have time when mom gets home. That'll rock, cuz I'm gettin a likin to the sound of acoustic playing, so I can work more with that :).      Jorden IM'ed me last night, said he wanted to do something tomorrow. I don't understand what's up with that child, but I dont care. The more I know the more I'll think, so if he wants to hang out, fine :P.      I'm in a good mood. :P
