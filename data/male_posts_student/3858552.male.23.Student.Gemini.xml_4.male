I'm not saying that i'm all for the issue myself, civil unions yes;however, I have had it up to my limits how these people (namely the family association of america) have pushed so hard along with our good president to deny people equal rights and even amend the constitution to deny citizens of a right! I am not an avid supporter of gay marriage simply because marriage is a christian valued concept and I will have no part in that, but civil unions will give homosexuals the same rights as everyone else. These republipukes that continue to push this issue are destroying the very fabric of our great constitution. They claim that it saves the protected institutions and fundamentals of our civilization, NO. It helps right-wing conservatives continue to cram christian ethics down everyones throat and do everything in it's power to avoid the seperation of church and state in our constitution. Progress will happen, like it or not and homosexuals, interacial couples, athiests and all other minorities have guaranteed rights and I can only pray that these groups will continue to push for what this country guarantees and that is FREEDOM. For all those who reject this issue and say it is destroying our families, let us remember this is coming from the same people who are all for this war in Iraq that is causing deaths in record numbers for WHAT PURPOSE??? I suppose that is ok simply because those soldiers are not doing anything wrong by occupying a foreign country that is NOT christian and that in no way goes against the "good book." It is not the soldiers that the democrats are against, IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE WAR. May whatever God you believe in help us if Bush gets re-elected in 2004, b/c the only thing that saved us from an amendment to deny civil rights is Democrat control over the senate... and Hitler won't stop there, he's gonna keep pushing until he crams his Christian propaganda down enough people's throat to change what this very country stands for!
