I'm an Atheist myself, but I always believed that anything may or may not be possible in this world.  However, I read one of the posts about if you do no believe in God, you will go to hell. I mean, that is seriously ****ed up. Does that mean a person who is good in moral terms will burn in hell if he didn't believe in God and a criminal who believes in God will go to heaven?  Still trying to figure out what is the Seven Gates of Hell. I heard there are 6 Gates at the US and a Gate at the UK.  Heavy rain in the early morning. It's been years since I smelt this kind of rain... The smell of the sea.
