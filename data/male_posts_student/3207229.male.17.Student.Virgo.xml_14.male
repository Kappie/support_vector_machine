I mean where does one find custard powder? Or stuffing? I mean there are many easy things: vegetables(if you know what the particular one looks like), drinks(I mean who misses hundreds of bottles?). But past that things get a little harder. And what shopping list doesn't have a few obscure items. I'm relatively okay: I don't mind asking customer services to label my list with isles or asking a question(to multiple assistants if needed to find a precise location). Then you have the nightmare of packing bags. Even a basket full takes more than one bag and this takes time: and even if the till assistant helps you(such as at ASDA(sometimes, if you're lucky)) that still stops them from serving other customers. One man's customer service is another man's customer disservice. In the event, I survived as ASDA had a cafe where I could sit down and pack my bag properly and take the crumpled fivers back out of my unzipped trousers pockets to disposite them somewhere safe.  A few practical suggestions: 1. An Index of items needed to be created 2. Stop moving around items! 3. Online supermarket shopping would workIF the customer was contacted if some item could not be found instead of the customer getting some substandard crap alternative.
