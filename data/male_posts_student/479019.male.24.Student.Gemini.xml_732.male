When I got home I had some Carl's Jr., chatted online, picked up some stuff at Sav-On, napped, went out to eat with the family, watched TV, and then went to BJs.   Another reason why the West Coast is better than the East Coast: Fresher seafood.  It was cool hanging out with Alex, Jon and Brandon at BJs.  So today... either I'll just lounge around all day, read, write or sit around on the computer. I'll probably hang out with Steff later this afternoon.  ****
