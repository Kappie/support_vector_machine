We will not argue about who was right about which points.  Just know that I love my Deep Dish.  Have a good night.  Don't break another bed.  That was embarrassing last time you did it.  I felt your fall at my house.  Sleep in.  Catch up on what you missed.  I was truly frightened this morning.  Much love...
