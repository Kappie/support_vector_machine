       
      I don't want to be a "man's man".  I don't think I even want to be a "guy's guy".  Sometimes I don't want to be "the guy who is fun to have around sometimes, and is sort of okay".  I don't want a girlfriend, I want something deeper, something more substantial.  I don't want to be the guy who meets someone and drops off the radar to everyone he cares for.  I don't want to be a bad friend.  I don't want to be a bad son.  I don't want to surround myself with negative people.  I want to be able to look at someone and know that they care, to be able to see it in their eyes, or in their body language, or to just hear them say it.  I want to know that everything is going to be all right, or at least it's on the right track.  I want to feel like I'm me, no matter what I'm doing or who I'm with.  I want to touch someone's soul with merely a word or maybe two.  I want to make a difference in the lives of the people around me.  I don't want to be forgotten.  No. Nothing's wrong.
