Ave's gonna be visiting soon too so that'll be pretty damn kewl.   I wanted to go walking today, but Im kinda sick right now =\. I wanna go swimming too. Or maybe I'll just go listen to music. Yeah... Ill go do that ina few minutes. I can nap too.   This is how things get when I have nothing to do... pretty soon Im gonna start thinking.. and thats not good for ANYONE.
