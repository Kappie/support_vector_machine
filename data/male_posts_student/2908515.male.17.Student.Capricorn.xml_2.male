I have the best of intentions in mind, just that its me and I tend to do weird things.   Today after school, I drove myself to Barnes and Nobles and got myself two books.  One was about the history of the three scientist that developed the Atomic Bomb.  The other one was the book that Ben sorta recommended.  That Japanese author.  Its a good book so far but I'm focusing more on my other books right now.  Thats about it today.  I am happy.  That is good.
