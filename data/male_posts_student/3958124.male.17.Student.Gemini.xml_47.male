We tell everyone (administration, teachers, students, friends, parents, god, 50 cent, ect.) that we don't think it's good. Some people even skip to go do things like eat burgers. If school were really, truly important, then people would put it before fast food. I wouldn't care though, because I have no car. That's probably good, because fast food is pretty addicting.  I saw a commercial for a shampoo or somthing from Pantene, the makers of that "pro V" crap. So I'm actually enjoying what they are showing - hot chick few clothes. But all of a sudden, they blurt out,  "And this 2 in one shampoo and conditioner is proven to make your hair LOOK 35% thicker!" What? Since when can any human walk up to a person and say, "My God Sally! Your hair! It must be AT LEAST 35% thicker than it was at orgy night last week!" The hair products industry must be full of shit. All their products do is take crap out of your hair, nothing more. Don't buy anything that says it does more. Buy the one that does the least. It won't give you cancer.  Less on hair, sooner.
