The room was a mess, with traces of clothes all over the place. Hana took a breath and stepped forward, gathering her courage. The worst they would do is rape her...right? After all, she was eight-teen, it wasn't unlike she didn't know what making love was. It couldn't be so bad with these men, could it? Mostly she was worried they would harm her, treat her badly, and never allow her to see her family again. The fattest man flopped onto the floor to sit near a table, filled with very stale looking fish, fruits, vegtables and soups. Hana frowned in disguist. The other men followed suit, as the fat man said to her, "Well missy, I guess your wondering why you're here and what we're going to do with you." Hana stood awkardly in the middle of the room; she lowered her head; tThe men laughed hoarsly. The fat man slapped his belly. "Well you see, us men haven't had someone to clean around here and we figured since you were an inn keeper's girl, you'd know how to keep a men's place clean!" The other men began crying out cheers of agreement. Hana widened her eyes and looked up at them in surprise.  "Oh, surprised?" the fat one asked, "What did you think? We'd rape you? Oh come now, little flower, we may be under that crazed Seishuu, and under that rather psychotic Saro, but we are good men none the less." "I'm just sorry we've been driven to this," a younger man said, "I do this to support my family...but without any woman to clean up..." "...It's just such a hard way to live," another middle aged man finished. The fat man smiled widely, his eyes lost in the grin, "We only ask you com here every once a week or so, right men?" Cheers came all around as sake was poured for all. Hana, still shocked, asked weakly, "Then why did you kidnap me? You could of just asked?" The fat man's face turned serious. "That is something such a flower as you would not understand." Hana nodded slowly and began to tie her hair back into a bun. She straightened her clothes and began her task, as the men lazily laughed and joked at the table. Hana was disapointed, it seemed as if her life was fully deticated to cleaning and no fun at all.  "By the way little flower," he suddenly called to her, "if I were you I'd watch out for Saro. He's never gentle with the ladies." "Yeah," said another voice, as Hana picked up clothes from the floor, "he considers women to be witches." "In fact, so does Seishuu," agreed another. Hana froze in her place as the door opened swiftly. Biting her lip, she wondered if it was Saro.  Haruka scaled the walls of the inn in silence and darkness, the dark Sky cloaked her as she clung to balconies, unseen by guards. Stretching out her senses and using pure instincts, she managed to locate the room where the famous Seishuu lodged. Famous for his mass murder of all those who were loyal to the deceased Lord, famous for his idea that all women were demons, witches, unworthy beings.  She stepped onto the balcony, making sure not to creek the gentle wooden floor. Pressing herself up againt the wall, just beside the screen door, Haruka listened to the sounds.  "You bitch, I'll enflict to you the greatest torture you could ever imagine," said a squeeky voice, that Haruka imagined was Seishuu. There was slight movement and a harsh cry that sounded similar to Hinotama's, and yet a bit different. The yelling continued, until it was completly cutt off into a muffled sound. Haruka's silver eyes did not waver, she knew it was dangerous to just rush into a room. Movement and grunting noises continued, pain seemed to fill the Night, and she felt she couldnt take it anymore. Reaching into her kimono, she pulled out a knife with a skilled movement, her whole figure taking on that of a shadow and flung herself swiftly into the room. Saro walked into the room, his compsure was unusually lazy, gripping his sword at his side with a firm hand. Hana looked at him with wide eyes, wondering his intentions. The men suddenly went quiet as Saro began to laugh. He asked, "Do you wish to redeem your sins?" Haruka slit Seishuu's neck quietly, his body flopping over in a sudden spray of blood onto the figure he leaned over...Hinotama. Haruka's eyes flashed to the three men huddled between sheets on the far side of the huge, luxerious room, and then back to the massof blood as flesh that lay before her. Hinotama had a pool of blood sprayed around her and Haruka frowned at what Seishuu had done to her body. Catching a movement in Hinotama's face, Haruka leaned down to the mess and looked closely at the face that shifted...  The door opened with a bang, Hinotama standing in the door way. The men in the corner whimpered and clung together as she slowly stepped in.  "Stay back Hana," Hinotama said, turning to look at someone behind her, "you really don't want to see this." Haruka let out a deep breath as she watched Saro's face become clear through what had appeared to be Hinotama's. His clothes took the place of what had appeared to be a woman's kimono. "An illusion..." Haruka mumbled as Hinotama sat by her side.  Hinotama smiled sweetly as she looked at her friend, the red fan tapping at her chin. "Clever?" she asked. "Quite," Haruka agreed as she stood up; Hinotama followed her. "Where you worried?" she asked, nearing Haruka, who had wondered over to the three boys. Haruka's cold eyes stared at her momentarily, becoming cold in the Moonlight that peeked through the open baclony door. "No," she said and turned to look at the boys. "What do you think?" Hinotama looked up as if thinking, tapping the fan on her chin dramatically. She suddenly leaned down and smiled warmly at the boys, who appeared to be only from twelve to fourteen.   "Do you want to die?" she asked softly. One began to break out into tears, as the other being gripped by the two other boys turned away.  The third one answered: "Please, you would do us much a great favour..."  Haruka passed a bag to Hinotama in the room of the small inn they had been staying at. "Where'd you get this lovely emboirded bag?" she asked, reaching inside to take out her male kimono; Haruka turned away as Hinotama got dressed. "The inn keeper's gave it to me as I favour; I said I would save their daughter," Haruka replied, crossing her arms impatiently. "Done," Hinotama said, letting loose her long hair. "By the way," Haruka said, morning light spilling into the little room, "did you take care of the others?" Hinotama blinked as smiled. "Oh yes," she said, placing bloody hashi (chop sticks) on the table, "the ones that weren't willing to repent...of course." There was a gentle knocking on the door. Three beautiful, young boys, that seemed rather pale and unhealthy, and in between the ages of twelve to fourteen, stood there with food and beverages.  The smallest one smiled sweetly as Hinotama approached. "Are you feeling better?" she asked, taking the items from his tray. "Yes, much better sir," he responded with bright eyes, "although, none of us seem to remember a thing of anything before this morning." Haruka also helped, a grin touching her lips as she turned away to place things on the table.  Hinotama smiled playfully, "That must be hard on you're parents! Make sure to work hard here in their inn for them!" The boys laughed and blushed, bowing deeply with a gratitude to these mysterious men they weren't sure of why they had.
