Brook was there, (I guess she's the girl that Matt wants to get with.) she's really nice. So I talked to her for a bit afterward, then met up with Kristina, Adam and Jana, and packed for the show.    It was everything I had expected it to be. A small garage with a bunch of scenesters loitering around. The paranoia was getting to people and someone said that the neighbors were calling the cops. Big lie.    So a band plays, and then they play. Yeah, they is my band. I setup my piano in front of the amp, and hooked it up, but had no idea what we were playing. We had all thought improvising it would be cool, but I guess it didn't slip their mind that that requires communication. 20 minutes into I'm still "WTFing" to myself, trying to get their attention.    Needless to say, it was a very disorganized show. None of the mics worked, and our main guitarist couldn't show up.    To top it all off, I locked my keys in my trunk, and they're still in there right now. Ian drove Kristina, Adam and Jana back to their car, and then he and I went back to his house.     They were singing Bright Eyes at the show, (the band before us) and they weren't very good. Poor Conor would have to kick some emo ass if he heard the tone-deaf poetry pertruding from the garage.
