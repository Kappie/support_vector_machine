I am Only Lonely.   Finally got back to playing street soccer, but as a goalkeeper. I didnt like the extremely bouncy ball, and as i had only my squash shoes on, i didnt want to play in a outfield position. Made several saves, one which i was pretty proud of. Then finally, the ball's bounciness got to me. As i stretched my leg out to block a shot, the ball bounced over my leg... Oh well.. Off to squash.  Czech won, with Baros on a rampage. He is as he says, in Euro Dreamland. But no matter, he wont last the whole long competition, with Portugal facing them in the finals or Greece. Portugal will still remain victors.  PS: The pizza is still in the fridge. I think i should throw it away soon...
