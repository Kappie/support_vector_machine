I wish school could go on during the hours when I am concious.  It seems like I do fine in school but I just don't remember anything that happpens during school or ever use what I learn in school and apply it to my daily life.  It seems like that never happens... ever.  I need to figure out why this doesn't happen and hopefully change something in my life so that my senior year isn't a complete waste.  I know at least half the stuff I learn will just be forgotten.  I know the things I actually put to use, I will remember for the rest of my life.  That's it...
