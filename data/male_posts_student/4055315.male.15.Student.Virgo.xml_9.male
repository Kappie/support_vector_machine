I skated most of the day, and had to go to the mall to meet Mike's mom, and Jereme was walking so slow, he skated downhill and was still insanely slow for the slope we were on. But he was walking, and going too slow, and we [Jon, Mike and I] told him to start skating or we'd leave, so we gave him a minute and left him on a main road, four streets from his house. Somehow he manages to get jumped by one person and get his board [which he's head for a whopping two days] stolen from him. Mike's mom ended up not meeting us up there in the end anyways... so it was a huge waste of time. Jon Mike and I went to my house after, and played some crappy looking samurai game on XBox for a while, but it ended up being good...  nothing else happened today, besides nothing. Later.
