Anyways, working was fun because it wasn't really work, it was more of a slow, slow wait for customers. Also, it was more fun because the employees were much better. I will make a chart:  Last year employees: Nick - The devil who made a 2 pound cone Other Josh - Retarded hippy Matt - Drugged up hippy who liked Nick Andy - Crazy know-it-all wanna-be dentist with three jobs Stephany - Crazy stalker lady Amanda - One of the few employees who isn't retarded Lewis - Master work dodger Nancy - Grandma Josh - Lazy box cutter John - Me  This year: Stephany - Still crazy, now stalks Eric Eric - Cool manager type person who makes me food Jim - Another pretty cool guy Janelle - Old lady who thinks we are incompetent Lori - Crazy lady who thinks she can boss people around Amanda - Still not retarded Nancy - M.I.A. Sandy - Crazy gun-toting boss who has to do all of Mattson's work Lewis - Lord of the Universe of work dodging Josh - Still can't make cones  As can be seen from that chart, this year is much better. With the exception of Janelle and Lori, the employees are all very competent with the exception of Mattson. There are a few other employees of course, but they really don't bother me because I never have to see them.
