Maffs went pretty damn well, probably 40-50 out of 70 there...I think I need 60-65ish from the 2 papers to secure my B. Yaaay!!!  Tomorrow will be ok, only one exam, and its French Listening. Which is neither time consuming or difficult.  Between exams today was funny. Spent most the time channel hopping at Joes. Watched some reeeeally funny channels such as:  THE GOD CHANNEL! Basically this black American on a stage saying REALLY funny things like "We hang out with the wiiiise men" and the always-funny "Are your friends friends? Or are they tests sent by the devil?"  BBC PARLIAMENT! Yup. There was Steve Webb (our local Lib Dem MP, YAAAAY STEVE!) making a really dramatic speech about council taxes 'n' things. At first it was on a close up shot, so you could only see him, and the guy next to him who looked worrying like one of my uncles. After a while it cut to the wide shot of the whole room. Which was when we burst out laughing. There were  3 other people  in the whole of the house of lords. 1. That guy sitting next to him who looked like my uncle 2. Some guy on the other side of the middle searching through a pile of papers and 3. Someone sitting by the door in a wheelchair. And to make it extra-funny, when it cut back to the close up, the guy sitting next to Mr Webb kept bursting out laughing at random moments. Quite funny, I thought.  US SHOPPING CHANNELS! These were the funniest. 20-minute ads for blow-up beds, with 2 really cheesy and stupid presenters with funny names. At one point, to prove how amazing their bed was, they got a gymnast to do a dance routine on one side, while someone else tried to sleep. The other person was bouncing all over the place as you'd expect, but of course when interveiwed said "I couldn't feel anything at all! I nearly went to sleep!". Then the REEEEEAALLY funny bit: they got some comedy wrestlers to use the bed as a crash mat thing. One of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life.  OK, this post is long enough so I'll stop there.
