I guess Marty quit cause he was fighting with Evan or something, we have another guitarist who I havent met yet, but Evan still wants Brandon to play trombone when I thought he should go to bass.  Evan says he can easily find a new bass player, but still, it would be odd having two guitars and a trombone in a ska band...  I think we are temporarily fucked at the moment.  I'm really sick of bands not working.
