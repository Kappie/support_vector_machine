Through all of the shit they both went through and through all of the thingz that greatly affected their livez, all he wanted was her happiness...and at the end, jus to do that in order to make her happy...damn...that almost made me cry, cuz it was soooooo powerful to do all that...jus to make one personz life the best they want it to be. Damn man, him jus doin all those thingz in the name of love and doin all that stuff in order to make his life better and make him a better person...is a beautifuly thing. His determination and his will makez me proud to b the person that i am today...i jus wish thingz turned out differently, but its life, and its all gooood. At the end of the movie, do make the decision he had to make...damn...that took a man wit heart to make that final decision...its a beautiful thing...its a very beautiful thing...
