I really don't think the thought of going out with me has even crossed her mind. So, for now, I'm going to give up hope on her because of the above reasons and I'm only going to see her a few times over the summer, if that. Anyways, I have finals tomorrow, three of them to be exact. I'm really not too excited about those.  EDIT: CRAP! randomperson1 doesn't like me now because she has a boyfriend, nor will she ever like me. Meh. I'm still cool just being her friend. EDIT OF THE PREVIOUS EDIT: Actually, I don"t know for a fact that she will  never  like me, but I'm just assuming it to be true.  later, bradleyJ
