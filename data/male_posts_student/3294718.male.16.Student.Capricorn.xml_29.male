I finished my Gatsby essay, and I'm waiting for the sweet, sweet feeling of freedom to come flushing through my body. It won't be there fully till I hand in my final draft, but there's no way, after 95.1% in the class, AND student of the semester from Wang that I'ma get a B in that class, even if my essay is the worst one I've done.   As I see it, there's three main classes of liberals. In ascending order of my respect for them: BUSHWHACKERS: this is largely just a group of idiots who make fun of Bush because he can't talk. Man, that Bush is an idiot. He said, "Is our children learning?" He's obviously NOT fit for the job JUST because of that. They all hop on the bandwagon of making fun of him. It'd be interesting to see their views of the Prez if Kerry wins. REBELS: mainly those who are too lazy or just don't want to follow authority, they justify themselves as being 'non-conformist.' some of these people i like, such as anderw boos. however, there are those even below bushwhackers, like Ms. Borkenhagen. She just ignored one of the short essays on the APUSH test. It's the only time I've seen Lade dumbfounded, seriously dumbfounded. Not even when CJ said that Iraqi prisoner abuse was 'fair play' was he totally shellshockedly dumbfounded. Lastly, THE ONES THAT SCARE ME: Wanninger and Al Franken to name two, these guys know what they're talking about. Sure that they are right, they stomp all over every mistake any conservative makes. They hold their own and more in any argument, largely because of their superior experience and intelligence in about every matter.  My liberal friends like Mattson and Johnny don't fit these groups well. Mattson's bordering on scary, but doesn't provide enough proof that differs from the bushwhackers to truly scare me. And Johnny makes up stuff to try and prove his point, so his credibility is sorely hurting.  I truly don't see Chris as a "real guy." He's more like the Osbournes. I sort of like them in this grotesque fashion. I don't give them a lot of respect, but they don't command a lot from me. I do, however, enjoy his company for the most part, when he behaves himself in a socially acceptable manner. He's funny, crazy, and... um... innovative. Yeah, innovative.  I've had a lot of pent-up thoughts while not being part of this blog, so expect a number of lengthy posts to follow from me.   Of all God's creatures there is only one that cannot be made the slave of the lash. That one is the cat. If man could be crossed with the cat it would improve man, but it would deteriorate the cat. -Mark Twain
