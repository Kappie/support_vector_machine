Hung out at Linens n Things afterward. Once they were gone,I want to go see I, Robot.Will Smith..... Wow. That man is.......... Just.......... Wow.     ANYWHO, umm,I stayed walkin around till about 6, went to the iMac store to talk to my bro. Hemade me come home.. SoI did,making this the 10th timeI've walked either to or from the mall. *celebration dance*. Once home, I layed down and chilled... which is pretty much what I've been doing since around 7.        It was great being in the mall alone for once. Not that I minded hangin out w/ the gurls, cause in all honesty, they were pretty kewl. It's just... I don't know. Being able to walk around by yourself in such a social place, it gives you a sense of empowerment. Plus, I was listenin to my latest mix full blast, so I was rockin my head while walkin around from store to store. Felt great. I should do that more often.
