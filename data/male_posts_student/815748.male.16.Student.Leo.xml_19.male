I, Switzerland, said that everybody has nuclear weapons, especiALly the US, and the US has argued that having and even threatening to use nuclear weapons are not illegal, so why should we invade Iraq, which might have one in the future? Boo-yah grandma.  In other AL news, I'm going to do my debate tomorrow with Josh Turner (my original partner has mono). Wish AL luck!
