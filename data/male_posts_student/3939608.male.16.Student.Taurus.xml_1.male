So I looked, and the looking, it was in retrograde, backwards seeing eyes into the past of my literature. There I dug up this specimen, an artifact from freshman year. It was supposed to be the start of a book.   1. It shone on the scorpion in living colors: oranges and shifting sands, waves of dark sky as profuse with stars as the city landfill with fantastic litter and other shining things akin to peyote and the pallid puffs of yuccas' overexposed sex organs whose nocturnal explosion of essence insulted hypersensitive senses that did not want a part in the malodorous tirade. A wounded cold and gritty breeze reminded to shun the venomous and caress an affable and fuzzy arachnid scuttling a dyad of anagogic pink baby booties beneath sandy waters of expansive desolation. The night owl cried wildly beneath lunacy, for animals rarely go insane, while chill shivered its way beneath layers of denim, cotton and epidermis, right into intestinal spires exulting in mephitic elation in this virulent waste spanning the promenades of Euclid; yellow streaks guiding a way across a libidinous barathum in America. Grasses grew in the land of skulls, oddly reminiscent of the whimper of abandoned puppies in wet gutters, sprayed with dry puddles as the mirage flies past, or was that a hallucination? Cactus juices elucidate the expansive desolation and bring prophetic visions of African apes with the keys of Eden in clenched and hairy fists. It is the east, and the moon is the night tide sun, hailed by the wailing expanses. The desert throbbed with euphoria as a hundred billion stars drowned beneath black waves. And it rained a rainbow from the turbulent dome of heaven, vanquishing the topple onto feather soft strawberries.  * * *  âGoddamn fucking Swanson!â  * * *  The day was upon the desert like a lion upon a lioness; hot and insistent on pushing its very hard reality up something unpleasant. Curse Swanson; this was all his notion. A beautiful orchestration on his part too, with the long haul to Arizona to sample native delicacies and that accursed invitation in lyric brush script (my, he is talented!). He offered so much to Amanda and Billy also, and they accepted with a bizarre zeal. It sure was a hell of a party in the desert that night, but now they were, all of them, long gone. They took the red civic, the only transport, bastards. How on earth could they have driven the thing, though? Those people were so stoned that there should be a wreck twenty feet from this very spot. And why Amanda and Billy? This is the kind of disturbed thing Swanson would think of, so one can understand, but Amanda and Billy? This does not make an iota of sense. They probably left before the scorpion revelation began but an astro-traveler rarely notices such trivial abandonments.  Mirage waters floated about unquenched desire and blue permeated the desolate visage as the endless desert highway beckoned lost souls at the gates of hell. Golden dust wafted beyond a hovering celestial nacho and distant mountains scurried in fright from an unfamiliar traveler whose only consolation was a small pouch weighted with forbidden ambrosia. Scalding light pounded sore eyes and burned exposed flesh with the same mercy it showed the sand, and though soaring seemed a tremendous intellection it would have to wait until the daystar fell lest Icarus be consoled with another failure of his magnitude. Waxen wings filled the bag jostling at a stranger in the desert, but already the voluminous singularity was at hand, now as parched and barren as ten thousand ages of silica. The expanse slathered in nacho cheese and eyes fell from an execrable star rise. Without pity, hate, or an infernal display of mass media unconquered nature crouched in anticipation as the locusts scoffed in the countenance of dehydration. Puppies whimpered for want of water in wet desert gutters and the whiptail scorpion relayed an S.O.S. as it went down with its cryptic pair of pink booties towards the abyssal zones beneath the waves.  Indeed it was a revelation that lasted through dreams, though now that a spherical scorch, ruler of the day, rent the darkness as it exalted above the mountain peaks, the oracle evaporated like a pool in this sun. The boundless road showed a way across the un-wet beds of the Styx, to the west, and lilliputian hopes were consumed by nuclear fission at the magnitudes. Occasional monoliths stippled arid sempiternity. Silver-green stilettos incised the quavering atmosphere as sweltering morning devoured all remnants of humanity. Chirps and cries transfused the barren without break. The scorpion drowned, the apes disappeared, the spectrum stabilized, the stars returned to a disapproving maternal firmament, the puppies fell into dismal desert gutters which then sealed themselves forever, a tulip in Memphis shriveled for want of water and a pair of yellow bunnies played in a blazing cosmic pen. So was the day upon the sand.  * * *  Rhythmic oscillations of the airy heights disrupted an infinity opening above the tanned hide of Gaia as the first flickering flames of a primitive torch reached to touch an ethereal ceiling. The persons around trusted fire; the story of O2 meets C8H18 had brought them here after all. It is amazing, the incredible weakness of ego possessed by flames.  High velocity paint was sparkling and red in the rays of evening light. Death had not fallen yet in the western mountains; half of its horrid head still shone above the rocks onto a Dostoyevsky novel-like grit-scape. Hyphenated pink and purpled cirrus accentuated the distance and the yet to be fire waited in its place to be born. Point by point the Milky Way made its awesome presence known as pagan gods opened the door of the cosmos to the visiting earth.  How does the sun fall so slowly? It laid only a little way above the mountains, a giant spherical lamp. White lace was a prominent feature of the raged skyline, but the horizon became depressed and slit its wrists, bleeding in Technicolor on its delicate cuffs.  The spirits were proud that they lived such a beautiful life away from the drowning men who did not know that they should breathe deeply or not breathe at all. Gas is overrated anyhow. Better to inhale the colors, being in themselves a purer medium of sustenance. Watching the sky would enlighten its vibrant, darkening shades, but those who might admire it were fast asleep in a red automobile, and the driver was rather fixed on a repetitive set of yellow stripes.  Zaffer spread unevenly on the evening sky.  The bright midday did not see anyone. But that was a long time ago.  * * *  Shimmering skylights pulsated to the beat of a tiny and frightened heart as the owner scrambled for mousey tidbits suitable to stuff in a diminutive mouth. Not thirty paces distant a small party did trip thereabouts a kerosene lamp, weaving as moths about its flame. Their indeterminate shapes made a way around the oil fuming towards the constellations, three fluid forms dancing in the dust.   The...    (I didn't finish it, and probably never will. C'est la vie.) This was before I read The Sound and the Fury, before Sophocles; actually, it was around the time I was reading The Qu'ran and Plato's The Republic. Attached to the abandoned document I found two of my poems, presumably from the same time period.   Aconite  Hearken to the madman's words, Hurled across time like the seeds of aconite; Power to the possessor As it was to the cabal. Power in that aberration! Poison's realization.  Expression of a venerable acolyte. Imagine all the people falling, No better for reverÃ©d right. Repressed calling To stop the bloodshed. Jurisdiction by an ill fed devil.  Demons of divinity.   Something about the Color Red  the rhythm isn't what I went fur when I cried out keep it flowing, beautiful blood! more on the ways of desire I reported left one dead. hxillotalifrommmwrrrzerrrrttaxesum! and it was sublime the way cried out to the rain ofâ¦ of the wave. the. I remember something dead. it stayed on the porch for a week.  beatitfull. beautiful. rot.    Its funny. I still am lost. My best bet is to re-read Antigone and think again on it.  Maybe a muse will pity me.   _____________________________________________________________ ****HYPOCRISY IS THE GREATEST LUXURY****     Spoil yourself at     The Hypocrisy Entertainment Network     http://www.hypocrisy.org
