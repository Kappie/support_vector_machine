Extremely repetitive and boring. And to make things even better, it rained. I don't know if mosquitos really like the rain or what, but they made me into a blood smoothie (that sounds really gross). The bastards.  Tomorrow, I'm going in with my dad to the Farmer's Market. I have to get up at 4:30 (DREAD) and work there for most of the day, but I should make a pretty hefty income from it. If all goes well, I'll be doing that every Wednesday during my break too.
