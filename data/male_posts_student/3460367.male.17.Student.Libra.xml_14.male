I'm going to be looking through my logs from last night and trying to make sure I hit on everything you brought up.  So it may seem like I am jumping around pointlessly.  Before I start talking about anything I want you to read this letter over several times.  I know there is going to be a lot of information and I don't think it is humanly possible to take it all in at once.  So before you respond, please make sure you've read through it a couple times.  Also, I am in no way angry at you.  I know you can't hear the tone of my voice when I am writing but trust me, I am not angry at all.  	To the logs...  	My giving you the cold shoulder.  Hopefully I can explain this and make sense at the same time.  The reason I gave you the cold shoulder was because I was hurting and I let my emotions get the better of me.  Truthfully when I was doing it I was hoping that it would annoy you or hurt you.  I am sorry for that.  I regretted it right after I got off.  I shouldn't have treated you that way.  I was hurting because I felt that you didn't want me in your life anymore.  Right after we talked that Sunday and when you got back online is when I first got that impression.  I forget what you said but it was something like trying not to lose touch when you go to college.  Now I realize that isn't what you meant, but then it seemed like you couldn't wait to get away, and that you were already thinking about the future and I didn't factor into it.  Then when you weren't able to come to the last couple of YG's and to the movies, it just let things get worse in my mind.  I told you I'm paranoid, but in truth I'm a worrier.  I will worry about anything and everything.  Most of the time no one will know it but I do.  There were a few other things that gave my imagination ammunition.  One of them was when you wrote in your journal about how you were flirting with Ozzy.  I felt it was significant because you and I had been flirting before you and Joe broke up.  You told me once or twice that you broke up with Joe because "you weren't being true to yourself."  Whatever that means I took it as you liked me more than him.  So in my mind I figured you didn't want me around you anymore.  So yeah I probably let my imagination get hyperactive with all that.  Also I know you and Kevin have gotten close (which is good I think Kevin is a great guy) and I remember how that used to be me.  Now I understand that, you needed someone you could trust as a friend to bounce ideas off of.  And since I was something else to you, Kevin became a good friend.  But afterwards when we decided we only wanted to be friends I kinda got the impression from you that you didn't want me as a guy friend to talk to because you had Kevin.  So yes I let my imagination get going and that is my fault.  However I've asked for forgiveness for doing what I did and I mean it.  If you don't want to forgive me then maybe you aren't the person I thought you were.  	Okay so that didn't go as bad as it could have... now onto the next topic foremost on my mind...  	Last night you said you felt I was jealous of someone.  Well I guess you could say I am.  I'm jealous of our friendship.  You have no idea how much it means to me.  Like it or not you still know the most about me out of anyone.  I trust you pretty much unconditionally.  I respect you a lot and I don't want to lose you as a friend.  Lisa I really don't want anything other than friendship from you.  I know I've told you many times I want you to be happy with whoever.  I want you as a really good friend, someone who I can talk to and also help when you need it.  I told you I've lost a lot of my friends over time and I don't want to lose you, well here is one very good example.  Before I met you, Renee and I were good friends.  We could talk about anything and I trusted her.  When I told her I liked you things changed very quickly.  And I lost a very good friend when I don't think I really should have.  Now don't take this as me saying you caused it or whatever.  Because you didn't.  All those choices were mine and I accept full responsibility for those.  But what I am saying is I lost a close friend and I don't want to lose you as a close friend.  Aside from you (and Jill but that is kinda different since we don't see each other all the time) I don't have any female friends who I can talk to.  Jen and I were never really all that close.  Same with Allison.  Steph... well we'll save that for a later paragraph but I can't talk to her either.  Steph was a good friend and yes I feel I've lost her.  So no I don't want to lose you as well.  So yes I guess you can say I'm jealous.  I just want to have you as a good friend.  And I would appreciate it if you would let me know what's going on in your "love life", but I don't want you to tell me unless you are comfortable with it.  (Altho if I think you're dating a jerk I might have to tell you :-P)  I don't want to be jealous (in the bad sense) of anyone.  	Thinks.... naw we'll save Steph for later...  	As for me wanting you to come to YG.  Well it is true.  I want you at YG.  But no I don't want you to skip out on previous plans.  If I had a prior commitment I would miss YG too.  But yes I love seeing you there.  That is truthfully the only place I get to see you now.  I don't want you feel like I am pushing you to come or whatever.  But would you rather I not tell you when YG's are?  Would you rather I tell you not to come?  I tell you because yes I do want to see you there but I want you to do whatever you had originally planned.  But yes when you missed those several YG's I was sad and I wished you could have come.  So let me put this as clearly as I can.  I love seeing you at YG.  I wish you could be at all of them.  I understand you can't be.  I'm not angry at you about it.  I don't expect you to drop previous plans.  That is the best I can do.  	Time to talk about Steph...  	Kevin told me that you and him were talking about Kyle and Steph and how they were acting.  How different Steph acted around him, etc.  Well before Kevin told me he was talking with you about it.  I told him how I was glad I wasn't the only one who felt that way.  When he told me you felt that too I kinda was surprised.  You had told me not to talk to you about Kyle and Steph.  I really think you need to tell her how you feel tho.  Forget telling Kyle.  Like I said I was there when you and he were talking and he was talking to me about it.  He thinks you are over-reacting.  He wouldn't listen to me about it.  When you said he would side with Steph he looked at me with a look of disbelief.  Like how could she think that.  I told him I didn't think he could deal impartially because he would side with Steph I got a nasty look.  So I think without realizing it he has already sided with Steph.  Kevin told me what his plan was.  He said he was just going to ignore Steph and at the time I thought it sounded okay.  But I got to thinking.  I don't think we should ignore her without telling her how we feel first.  If she continues to act like that then I could see ignoring her.  I really think you should tell her how you feel.  But sometime when Kyle isn't around.  	Okay we're more than halfway!  	"lisxc7234: well jeremy how can i talk to someone who wont talk to me, and tell me what is on your mind>? huh?"  If that is about me giving you the cold shoulder then I think I've said enough already.  But if it isn't let me say all this.  I want to tell you what is going on in my life, and I want you to tell me what is going on in yours.  I want to be good friends.  Once you've read this letter, if you want I will tell you what is on my mind aside from all this.  I'd also like to hear about what is going on in your life.  Not just the "I ran so far, so fast, etc." and I'll make sure not to give the "My day was boring summary."  There are some really big things going on in my life which I'm pretty worried about.  I'm not really scared of them but at the same time I am terrified.  Then there are some pretty small things going on in my life which I'm worried about as well.  If you haven't figured out by now I'm a worrier, I worry over stupid things that I can't control.  I don't normally verbalize the littler worries because I don't think they are worth talking about, but if you truly want to hear them I would tell you.  But only if you really want to.  	I hope I've touched on everything important.  If I haven't or if I've brought something important up please let me know.  I want all this to be cleared up so I can be the halfway decent friend I was before.  I really care for you as a sister (unfortunately I've been treating you like one.)  	If you want to talk about this I ask that you don't do it online.  I would rather it be in an email (or a real letter) or in person (the phone/whatever.)  It is just too easy to get sidetracked and miss talking about something important.  But like I said at the top of this novel... please read the letter over several times.  Remember I wrote it because I wanted you to know how I felt and what has been going through my head.  I didn't write this when I was angry, so please don't think I meant any of this letter as quarrelsome or trying to provoke you.  Truthfully right now I feel tired and burdened.  So if there is a typo or something that doesn't make sense or whatever, take it in the positive sense.   			Hoping you'll let me be a brother (or bother same idea) 			because I love you like a sister,   				Jeremy
