Up 5 uncovered cement steps, or downstairs to the basement...about 15 uncovered cement steps.  That being said. Im upstairs, going out to my car... ready for a band concert. I fell down the first 5 and jumped up...hmm Im okay. Turned around and fell down about half of the other 15. That time I wasnt okay. My elbow got really messed up. I bruised the bone terribly. It is swollen on the joint where it hit the cement a couple times.  I had to throw varsity shot today at Algona. I threw about 38' something...I was pissed off. I probably should have said something to the other people about my elbow...but I thought it looked pretty good. Then I threw terrible and got mad. It is radiant with heat constantly. I cant do more than 3 pushups without nearly crying. I had to hold the shot with 2 hands so I wouldn't drop it and look like a fool. But then I threw terribly and looked like a fool anyways. (for those of you wondering our shot is 12 lbs)  I think I will let Dan throw the rest of the meets on varsity...we will see. Depends on how fast my arm recovers.  By the way, we won our second meet of the year. Humboldt High School are the 2004 Hackbarth relays champions!!!! I think we can do farely good in the conference. Wonder how that will go...
