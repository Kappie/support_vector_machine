Remember the old Wendy's ad where they're at a Soviet fashion show, and the Eveningwear, Sleepwear, and Swimwear are the same outfit? That's a good one. The music makes it. What good commercials are out there today? I remember the Super Bowl ad for E*Trade with the cymbal-playing monkey. Or something like that. Either way, they made a point of how they wasted $2 million on the ad, but they can show you how to invest your money smartly. Funny monkey! The Chili's ads for Baby Back Ribs were good, but only the first one. The rest were pretty redundant. Then they added N*Sync (what's with the asterisks?) where Chili's totally sold out. I like the Little Caesar's ad with the kid trying to release the Free Crazy Bread back into the wild. ("You're free, crazy bread, go go go!") The Blockbuster video game ads are good. Like the one guy that didn't stop playing games for days and started to smell bad? Then the store manager walks by and sniffs him and keels over, and then the one worker goes "Yes, we're closing early!" But I digress.
