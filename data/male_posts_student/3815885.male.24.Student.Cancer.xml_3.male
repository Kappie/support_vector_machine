I found out last night that my buddy is giving me his scholarship for Cedar campus; and one church is giving all of us from the school $25 towards the $300 required for the intense week of Bible camp - God's starting to answer questions even if i'm not really relying on Hiim at the present time. I have to write this paper about my worldview for my humanities class due next Thursday and yet i don't know what to write - to initiate creativity i pulled out one of my drawing pads and went to work on that trying to figure out how to say what i believe - so that it makes sense to the reader. . . i'm an English major so i best macke this peiper make cents. . . . :)  Peace out people - God loves you  T
