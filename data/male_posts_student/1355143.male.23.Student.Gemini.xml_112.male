Ciiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaoooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   HHHHHHHHHHHHooooooooooooooooooolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Yes, it's me!!!    I dontknow from where I sould start telling you...      First of all, (Adam already knows becasuse I wrote him a great email) for whom doesn't know me very well, I don'tlike staying in front of my pc and write, especialmente en ingles. Mi problema es que no me gusta mucho escribir en un idioma que no es el mio, tengo que pensardemasiado y me gasta mucho tiempo... just kidding!! but it's a good excuse for my spelling mistakes.      I started reading what you guys have posted here, and it's really cool!!! I know that Ulli has told me at least 10 times that I should have signed in... now I join the club!!! better later than ever!       Main events of my life since I've been back:   It's been really though at first (as for everybody I guess), didn't know what I wanted to do with my life... didn't know where I wanted to live... bla.. bla.. defenetly (?) a "don't know period". Thank God after about a month it was over. I finished my examens, andI started an internshipwith a pretty big Italian bank, I worked there for 3months in the Private Bankingarea. I liked it so I decided to do my final project over the same topic. De hecho el trabajo es sobre la synergiasintra Private Banking y Corporate Finance en la pequena y media empresas italianas.   I should graduate in October, if I wont be done with the project by then, I'll graduete in December. It doesn't make a big difference, here the final projects are always huge works of almost 250 pages that sholud include some research as well.    El mundo de los trabajadores puede esperar un rato mas!      I'm still living in Milan and I come home (Lucca, Tuscany) once in a while, usually for the weekend.      During the "don't know period" I broke up with my boyfriend, after almost 2 years. it's not been easy to handle the consequences of that decision, but now I'm fine.      This summer I'm going to Menorca with Francesca, we'll spend a week there. Everybosy says it's a beautiful place, I hope they are right. After that I'll be going to Elba Island with my family. It's a tinycute island in the Mediterrean Sea, more or less in front of Tuscany. Dont know if you have ever heard about that, but Napoleon lived there for a while.      Tim, I received your email and I can't belive you are going to get merried. I'm so happy for you and I truly wish you and your fiancee (spelling?!?!) the best.      In Italy there is the bad habit of getting married too late, around 30s,whenyou have a safe job andyou can afford a nice house. Your way to approch marriage is much more romantic.      Adam and Ulli are working hard, Ulli told me is working in the asset managment division, hedge funds and stuff like that. You, Adam, are you working in the Private Banking division? After my studies I understood that UBS is the leader (at least in Europe) in the Private Banking market.. .ifthey need somebody... eh! eh!let me know!    I dont want my post to be too long and tired people, I'll write again in a few days.   love to everybody      Beatrice
