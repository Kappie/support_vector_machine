Please check out the Christian fish and flag on my frame to the right and hold your mouse over it for my favorite quote that goes with it. The flag should wave if you see it right. The Christian fish is almost identical to my pure silver ring I got from my girlfriend Brittany with the fish on it.   Anyway, about the quote, I'm sure you are all wondering! I learned the quote from Mr. Naegeli. He learned it in Africa in the peace corps. "Wisdom is like the baobab tree.  No one can embrace it all. " That's the end of the quote: No one can embrace it all. It basically means: As the baobab tree is way too big to embrace, so is wisdom, but stretch to do so anyway.  Blog ya later!
