I skip that *shit* every Tuesday and Thursday. I didn’t stay for tutoring, I stayed for the Talent Show. Well I have to say SOME people there did have talent. But let’s not even talk about the one’s who didn’t have any talent (Help them Lord.) Well, let’s go back to the beggining. I lied to my teacher and told to him that I needed to use the bathroom, it was on the last 4 minutes of school, where I really went was to meet Soraya at the main office because we were going to the talent show together! HOLD UP!!! We went as friends. Chill people, anyway, I got there just before the bell rang me and Soraya Ran to the auditorium to be the first one’s there. Me, Soraya, and Igor! We waited for the show to start. Well, when it did it only took what? like 3 minutes. The show was going ok for the first 30 seconds of it. Man, not wanting to be racist but these Monkeys (monkeys= black people from MMS) sat behind us. Man, they would always *fucking* yell when anybody got up on stage specially when some type of gorilla (gorilla = a big male black person ) got up there. They would YELL something like, "You so fine!" or, "I love you!!" Dude, we didn’t hear *shit* when they were yelling (they yelled throughout the whole show). Then this girl got up on the stage and she was singing solo(accapela) and it was all quiet and then I yelled, "Go ChaQuiChiBarucha!!" That had nothing to do with the girl's name and everybody looked back at me and started laughing. The show lasted for like 2 hours and 30 minutes. Good lord. Because the monkeys started to stink the place up like it was a zoo (zoo = a place full of black people from marietta) up in there.  When we got outside it started to rain so I called my aunt to come pick us up. Man, she took forever to get there and it was raining so me, Soraya, and Amanda started playing in the rain. Igor didn’t feel like playing, so he just watched us and laughed. Amada was jumping in the mud, it was funny, anyway it rained a whole *fucking* lot. Today was fun. Only 3 more days until the *shit* is over .
