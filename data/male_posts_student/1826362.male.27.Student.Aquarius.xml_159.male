But lately, things have been in the wrong place.  like, the other day, I went to the subway station just like I always do, went in the same entrance, walked down the same stairs and turned in the same direction to get on the northbound train.  the train is coming just as i get to the platform, and as I'm about to get on, i happen to look up at the sign, and it's the southbound train.  I look across and the northbound track is on the other side.I was in the right place, but the train had switched sides.   And it's still there now.   And tonight, I went to a subshop I go to sometimes.  and I got my sub (meatball) and walked out, and turned in the same direction I always do to go home.  But after a block I noticed that I was walking in the wrong direction.  The whole world had shifted around.
