This morning I'm watching VH1 best month ever and a special about La Toya Jackson. I think its funny. All these shows on MTV and VH1 are showing the lives of celebrities, but all of them seem to go to the Kentucky Derby. What's with that? They all meet up there too.. and funny thing is.. Jessica Simpson is on each of these shows. Sheesh. We watched an episode of Anna Nicole and the same thing happened. She's a funny character, and her son is one screwed up guy.  You find out so much useless crap about famous people if you watch enough television. I think I'm going to Brueggers in a little bit. Cindy wants me to wake her up to go to the picnic, but I'm gonna let her sleep until this afternoon since the picnic is at 5, so we have to leave around 3:45 or so. Ugh, the Jackson family has had so much plastic surgery. La Toya was really hot until she had her nose done, and now she looks fake.
