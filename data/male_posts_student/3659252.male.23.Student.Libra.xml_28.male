I was thinking that while everyone is home, we should try to diversify our activities... this could include new bars and restaurants, outdoorsy stuff and non-paying activities.  Does anyone like playing ultimate frisbee or volleyball?  Both of these could be co-ed games... unless the beauty of playing basketball is the testosterone shield that radiates off the court.  And if you haven't heard already, my resolution for 2004 is to go to Z Z's Big Top on the corner of Detroit and Jaycox.  I'm very scared to go alone... and I don't particularly think I'd enjoy a lynching... but who's with me on this one?!  Okay, that's enough for now. (Shout out to my ladies... Lana, Sunita... do you want to go out for tea next week?  There's this cute place in Lakewood called La Tea Da.  I suggested going there once to Ravi, and he said he was busy "that night."  Funny, I never specified a date...)
