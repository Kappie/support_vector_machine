I'm not a drunk, fucked up, gay, handicapped, etc.  I downloaded KQ2... I'll play that later.  Then I watched most of  Pirates of the Carribbean . I really like the movie and all, but it's about 20 minutes too long. I started dozing during the DVD around the same place that I got bored in the theater... the part where Johnny Depp and the chick get dumped on the island. I still think that movie ripped off elements of Monkey Island.  I'm bored.  **
