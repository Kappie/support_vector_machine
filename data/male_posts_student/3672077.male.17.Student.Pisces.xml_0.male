So how has everyone else been lately? Family doing well? How about your brother? I hear he's getting into big things now! Hehe, just playing with your mind! Feel free to leave comments people!   I start my temporary job tomorrow! I get to setup yet another router and a new DSL connection. At least I get to do what I love! I love to work with computers and I guess I'm pretty good at it. I guess that's where my fascination with all things electronic or mechanical comes from. It's just nerve calming...   What I also find fascinating is how disabled teachers think kids are with computers. In the computer labs, they give us tonnes of time to do something simple like open Microsoft Word. It feels quite degrading for most people my age simply because most of us are proficient computer users, and for some MSN is an extension of their life. Yes this is reality for some, but it can get a little bit scary to see these typists type their life away. At least thumb or something!
