I say anyone who has seen Farve (spell it like you say it, you creole bastards!) play the Bears, we know its gonna be messy.  I don't care if the Packers go 2-14 for a season, the 2 wins will be against the Bears.  Anyways, if we do somehow kill them, and beat Minnesota who is sucking anyways.... We might even have a playoff chance.  Just being optimistic.  The zoo was fun this weekend.  Nothing beats starting Christmas early, and God knows Christmas is gonna bring mixed feelings this year.  Never got to seeing Two Towers yesterday.  Got too much stuff done that I needed to.  Im just a huge big stress ball.  All my fault really.  But I've been in worse situations before.  I just cant wait for the weekend though, when Im not so stressed, and I spend a fun weekend with the Lodgers and alums in a possibly drunken haze.  Well, probably not, but who knows.  Sammy went home today, which kinda sucked cause we were having a fun weekend.  But two weeks and she will be back, hopefully not as stressed herself, being the end of the semester and all.  Starting to plan big nights for her return... Frontera Grill?  Ohhhh yeahhhhhh.  Rick Bayless is god, and if his restaurant is as good as his recipes in the book, its gonna be a good night.  Oh yeah, anyone have any plans for New Years?  Then a wedding.  I need to call erne or something, I haven't talked to the girl since graduation.  That reminds me... I wonder how Joe is doing?  Damn... I need to work on getting in contact with my college friends better.  Oh well, back to the grind.
