Also, we are in desperate need of sprite artists and artists in general. We need character sprites and face images to go with them. If anyone is interested please either comment on this post or send an email to me at  urlLink mepcotterell@gmail.com  with the subject "PZFN Staff". Please explain what exactly you want to do and why I should let you do it.   In other news... I've been working round the clock creating a new Content Management System and forums for the new PZFN. I've also put aside the battle system in the RPG, for now, and have begun work on an NPC engine. Once that is done I will start on the Battle System again.   Also, I went to Kevin Rose's Blog again and saw this sweet deal.
