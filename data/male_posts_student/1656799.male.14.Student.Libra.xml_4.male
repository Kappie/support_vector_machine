Little things have been happening in the past few days, but my negligence to post them as soon as they happan has led me to forget them. How unfortunate. ¬_¬  On Sunday, I will be leaving Swindon with James and his dad to go to their boat in Salcombe. For those poor (well, hardly anyone knows where it is) in Geography, Salcombe is a coastal village/town situated in southern Devon. As really dodgy as it sounds we will be going there for five days, and doing many things. Going for hikes (I think), lazing about and just walking around the place will be the most of it.  I promise I'll take lots of photographs, and I will have a journal by the time, so do expect a big massive entry from me (thats if I bother, someone remind me) when I return.  Before I go I have various things to buy, namely a journal, pen, and some clothes. When it comes to clothes I'll buy them in the generic form (free of brands and logos and whatever, thus removing all sorts of social labels I can be given). I'll purchase Are You Dave Gorman? by Dave Gorman, as that shall be my reading companion for the holiday.  So yes, expect comedy, drama, and downright silliness. I'll update a couple of times before I leave and if you're all little good boys and girls maybe a picture of me. (Oh yes, aren't you the lucky ones?)  Toodles.
