In the end, I onli managed to finish it around 2pm. L0L! Kindda long for a compre eh?  The rest of the day was basically slack for me. I started workin on my English Presentation on Thursday. I'm topic was actually "U.S Roles In Iraq", but I managed to swap wif the lil' pig, how kind of him. Hehe. So, my topic now is on Reality TV, my favourite topic out of the rest on the board. L0L! I must thank lil' pig for lettin me do it.  I did research on some reality tv shows and started on the powerpoint presentation. I did about 6pgs and I'm like halfway through already. I haf to find time the to complete the rest of it by Thursday. I'll probably be able to if I focus on it. I realised tt most shows I watched on television are most of the time reality tv shows as well. Let's see, probably 9/10 tv shows I watch are reality tv shows. Well, I juz like watchin reality tv shows. Maybe cuz it's real and shows wad actually realli happens, unlike dramas, which are most of the time, fake.  Well, tt's basically bout' it for the day's activities. Tmr is back to school for me and I'm gonna haf an early rest now. So, I'll cya some other time ya? =]
