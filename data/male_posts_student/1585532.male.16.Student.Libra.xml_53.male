To all kids who IM me just to bug me or say stupid stuff and block me:  You guys are all fucking assholes.  Seriously, don't come out and start bein all nice and then turn into a bitch and be like "Oh my b/f doesn't like that blah blah blah."  Because guess what? I COULD GIVE A FUCK LESS ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND!  For all I care, I hope he gets hit by a truck, then a steamroller, and then swept up by a streetcleaner.  And don't judge me either.  Ever hear the saying, "Labels are for soupcans," hm?  Because I'm pretty damn sure I'm not a soupcan.  So don't label me.  And BFD that you blocked me, I could seriously care less about someone blocking me.  I'm not going to sink to your level and start IMing you back and shit, because I seriously could care less about you.  I never met you, and hopefully, I never will.  And if I do, I'll probably stab you with a spork, or at least knock you in the head.  Just leave me the fuck alone you annoying little bitch(es)!  You know who you are, and you damn better not IM me again!  [/rant]  Okay, in other news....I got this cool little signature thingy off this cool site!  The thing shows all my little vitals when I'm signed on my interenet dealie thing.  Click the thing to learn more about it.  If it says something like "The system is down" or something, it means I'm offline, but you can still click it...I put it at the bottom of my site now, yaay!  Okay so as I was saying, I've been putting up with mass amounts of stupidity lately.  Disneyland, home, just about everywhere.  So we went to Chili's last night, and there was like a 30 minute wait.  More stupidity?  Ugh.  At this point, I was  not  in a social/people mood.  If someone was to come up to me, and insult me in any way shape or form, I probably would've tried to slit their throat, and watch them die while laughing.  Yes, I was  that  pissed off at everything/one.  Luckily, nothing happened.  So we go home, on the way home, my sister/family decides to start arguing.  At this point I told them to go fuck themselves, and went into my room.  And thats where I've been.  Anyways, had a fun chat with a friend of mine, which lasted for awhile, and then had some boringness.  Then this bitch IMs me and was all friendly, but then turned into a snobby little shit.  Needless to say, I hope she burns in hell (not too close to me though).  Damn bitch.  Well, thats about it for me, I'm done....so...bye.
