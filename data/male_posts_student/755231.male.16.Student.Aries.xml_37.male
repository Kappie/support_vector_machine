Played Sii on UT online, his lag time was so incredible the only thing we could do is kill eachother or both of us with the redeemer. (no wonder they put that thing in that game) Talked to lighting, he was back on yahoo. I watched his webcam again. He moved in with little Dobie and a furry mate, so now they are in dobie's house. I gotta meet those florida babyfurs someday. 2 New babyfurs joined on the message boards Oh yea Night got her stuff working again so she's online, i could'nt talk to her because I was playing Sii then Brad had to call his brother and bumped me off *grr*  I'm actually blogging offline. I took out all of Brad's old tapes and wow he has good taste in music. Enya, Starship, Bonnie Tyler, Belinda Carlisle, Duran Duran, and other bands...Yes is there too hehe I'm actually listening to Starship right now and I want em as mp3's. Thats gonna take forever to download. I watched Queer as Folk again last night. Its a gay show but it kicks ass! This one gay dude had to babysit his 12 year old nephew and when he found the dude stealing outta his wallet the gay guy stormed out of the shower took the money out of his pocket then gave him a swirly. When he was done he said �this is why you don't fuck with gays� I was like Holy Crap! Then when his nephew went back home he called the cops and said the gay dude molested him. Which he didn't, then this like 16 year old gay dude caught on to the bastard nephew and made him confess. Can't beleive a gay show touched that much on subjects. It goes to show that gays aren't pedofiles even tho thats first people's impression of them. Kinda like Infantilists, Iguess. It was a very emotional episode. It actually shows how mean people can be. �Gays are going to hell! Godless fags� People really hated gays in that one. But how could you not relate that to anything weird? Well to say i'm gonna watch that show again, comes on tonight at 10. Hehe I watched it all summer vacation and now i'm watching it again.....could this be a bad thing? .....that show kicks ass. I hope Kritter's night job ain't draining him too much, he wasn't online for a while. Oh I almost forgot to mention I applied for VCL I turned in 3 piccys. The Tiger I drew for Anamio, the foxie I fixed up in photoshop and my recent rebel fur I did in pen in study hall. They are all in different mediums just to show furs what I can do. Some of the VCL artists suck so it should be a sinch to get in. Not as hard as yerf ;) But they are all professional artists. I hope to be one someday.  Pandr got me a little present. It was a piccy he found of grumpy bear from 'care bears' that was coolies I thanked him, he's a kick tail fur. I also talked a little more to Rusty and Aristowolf. Actually something funny Rusty had a dream about me and him in the car. He feel asleep and he dreamed that me and him where in a forest, then the ground broke up from underneath us. A few furs came up to us then we looked at eachother and we had tails. Weird, huh?   *huffs* Brad better get off  the phone soon or i'm gonna snap in two! ......... Ok he's off! -warm wuff cubby hugs -Kit Wolf
