Miss all my Dunedin buddies, Becky, Kristyn, Chris, Jeremy, and even more all of the guys who graduated last year that i used to hang out with in programming class!!!  I'm sure i'll have a blast a CHS though since Aaron, Andi, Ted, Beave, Emily, and all the other crazy people there!  Good luck to everyone this year, try not to work too hard or slack off too much!
