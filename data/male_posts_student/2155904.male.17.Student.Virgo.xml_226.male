Right now Tyke is in an internet cafe in Paris and he just checked out of the Hotel Yllen and now he has to wait until 4 PM to get onto the Eurostar for a 2 and a half hour train ride from Paris to London crossing the Channel underwater.  It will be a good time hopefully as the train goes 180 mph and will be underwater for about 25 minutes Tyke thinks where it will be just black outside.  This is going to be a nice little finish to the time over here.  Not having to switch trains a lot or do anything stupid like that.  But yesterday was a good day.  Tyke saw the Louvre for a while, Mona Lisa included.  The Mona Lisa is pretty cool.  The eyes really do follow you and Tyke couldn't decide whether or not she was smiling.  Venus de Milo was also there and it was pretty impressive.  Most of the stuff there was impressive though.  Then Tyke went to the Arc d'Triomphe and saw Champs d'elysees as well as seeing some other cool things there.  Then he saw the Eiffel Tower and got dinner near there.  And he took a boat tour of the Seine and got a different view of Notre Dame which he saw earlier in the day.  Basically, everything over here is cool.  He really likes it but also has gotten a little tired and is coming down with a new sickness.  He has a sore throat again and is trying to get rid of that.  But last night was the last night that his brother is going to be with them.  He continues through Europe for another 2 and a half weeks while the rest of Tyke's family goes home tomorrow.  Damn, Tyke is so excited.  It's been a pretty good trip but he still is looking forward to home so very much.  Tomorrow Tyke will spend a little time in London before he gets on the plane which will take him all the way to Vancouver, BC and then he hops on a small plane to take him to Sea-Tac.  It will be about a 10-12 hour ride all told and Tyke is supposed to get in at 7:30.  So hopefully he will be home at 9PM Sunday, July 4th.  Give him a call on his cell if you wanna hang out that night.  Maybe he'll call you back when he gets back.  Haha, of course he'll call.  Right now he just got on AIM as the computer he is at has it but of course it is 3AM at home so nobody is online.  Oh well, he still got to be online.  The first time in 18 days for Tyke.  That's the longest he's been offline since he has had it.  Yeah, he's a freak.  Time to go now though.  This might be the last time Tyke gets to blog but he will be in London tomorrow so if he needs to pass some time he can always find a place there.  But if not, Tyke will see you Sunday night!!!  At least in words he will.
