Having a perception of another person isn't always how you think about them. You should always expand your thoughts and feel open to outside comments. Constructive criticism is what separates just plan criticism because constructive is helpful not ever hurtful. Being able to say what is on your mind shouldn't be taken away from you. It is what makes our country different from so many others, the ability to comment about a topic and not be shushed no matter how unusual it may. Obsequious the right word to explain the lifestyle that young teens live towards females of the same age or close to it. Agree for the sake of agreeing to please is the stupidest thing ever, that and voting for Republican because you have always been a republican. You need to think outside the box and fight your first thought, just think about something before you talk, Jumping to a conclusion without all the fact is wrong. THINK!
