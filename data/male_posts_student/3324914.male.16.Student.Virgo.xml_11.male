They served their purpose. I just had them on for backround sound. Because whenever I have boring movies on, I sit down on the floor and work with metal.  I have dozens of huge reels of electric fence wire that I've been cutting into two inch (something like that) strips. After I cut them, I spend a entire day bending them into rings. And after bending them, I hook them together to make chain armor, like the stuff off Lord of the Rings. In about 2 days I can make 1000 rings. Its hard work. A chain tunic is my first large chain project. I usually work with sheet metal to make plate armor. I find that plate armor and fish-scale armor are the easiest things to make.  And other than that, I make other odd objects. I'm quite the inventor. Some of the other things I've made have been.... Oh! nevermind. Its a hush-hush operation, lol.  And now, after all that blister inducing labour, I'm just sitting infront of this computer. Maybe I'll play some "Alien vs Predator 2." __________________________________________________________________  I missed the finale show of Frasier! I can't believe it! Oh well. Instead I watched CSI. and after that I watched E.R. The latter is pretty cool. I never used to watch it, but now I like it for some reason.  Even though I missed the last Frasier, I'm lucky I didn't miss the last Friends. I'm glad I caught it, But frankly, it was a fairly boring farewell. I didn't get too much out of it... maybe its just me.  You know what is another awesome show - the O.C.  That show is awesome. I heard they might do a spin-off about seth and his "boating trip," lol. If thats true, thats hilarious. Adam Brody (seth cohen) is funny. I laughed straight for at least 2 minutes when we found out that his toy horse's (on the show) name is "Captain Oats." __________________________________________________________________   Well, thats it for today. Bye!
