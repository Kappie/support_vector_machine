Nothing exciting happened at work so im gonna flash back to yesterday, which actually was fun and im gonna re-title my entry right here. Also im going to speak in the tense as if it were yesterday...or is yesterday...i dunno...   My Fun Day With Matt!!  Today was awesome. I really need to hang out with Matt more often. I love it, cause even if we dont do anything, if we are just sitting around, we always find something to talk about, no matter what. If its music, movies, video games...doesnt matter, always enjoyable. The only somewhat not enjoyable part of the day is when Roxy and Manda decided to come over and have a sit down talk. Which we found funny because I had suggested it earlier, before they came, to do something like that later in the night. So, we all sat down and tried discussing everyones feelings on everything. I  kind   of think it may have helped, but then again...its easy to say something like that wont happen again, but its a lot harder for it to not actually happen. I dunno. Well, after that we all decided to try and patch things up by having a quick lunch together at Taco Bell before parting our seperate ways. After that Matt and I went over to Circuit City to check out some games that Matt was thinking about buying cause he heard that they were selling them for cheap. They ended up not having any that he "needed" so went over to look at the music section, looked around there for a while where Matt spotted a three disk deal for only $20...he bought it and then we left and went over to Target. He got the stuff he needed and then we picked up Amanda and drove around looking for something to do but ended up just going back to his house. Stayed there till we had to go pick up Jason and then we went back to Matts and played some video games. It was a very enjoyable day. Im hoping Wednesday will be just as fun, cause thats my only other day off this week. Im also really excited about next week though...I get to go up to Port St. Lucie to visit my cousins who i havent seen for like over a year or two. The only downside is that my moms living there now and its gonna be extremely gay. Welp, till next time...  By the way...I LOVE THE MOUSE! ITS AWESOME!
