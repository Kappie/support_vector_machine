Finally got through my 1st sharing with the Sunday class! haha... i was really nervous cause, it was the 1st time since i don't know when whereby so many people turned up and inclusion of new members such as Wei Kong, Celine and a few more... Including Lisa's friend as well as Robyn's friend! haha... yeah, well... The J3s joined us too! and wah lau, there was os many people... haha... but... i guess, my nervousness was really uncalled for lah. It was like, i walked up on to the front of the class and simply burst out laughing cause i was nervous, one of the 2 symptoms that i have whenever i am nervous or embarassed... haha... the other, is more disgustiong, but, only happens whenever it is regarding to Sports or Competition... haha... Can ya guess?  Anyway, it's like, i was sharing and i guess, i was really dramatic and my nervousness made me like super funny or something lah! Kept on making the class laugh! Oh man! Arghs! hope i didn't make THAT big a fool of myself! haha... but it was good to at least see the whole class laughing together for once lah... heex... Perhaps, i have set the tone or standard for the guys to undertake, i sure hope that we are all funny! Haha... ooh! but i've got to say this! Li Feng (or however you spell her name), Lisa, Celine Robyn simply have beauty smiles! heex... and please ah, i really don't mean anything, but it was really nice to see everyone smiling... Okok, at the expense of my own face lah... but oh well...  However, i was happy that at least the 2 teachers in our class said i did very well... but... OH NO! they want me to do it again! Argh! i am so screwed! haha... but... it's ok, i shall take everything in my stride and give my best! heex... haha... whatever happens, at least i know that i can put my faith in the LORD! ;p  Ok... i had dinner to celebrate my grandmother's birthday... oops, i forgot, my uncle's too! haha... But anyway, it was great to see everyone again... but... why is it that every single time we have a family gathering, the center of attraction is me? They never seem to run out of topics with regards to taling about me! HOW COME?!!! haha... oh! i finally got to see my beloved cousin who went overseas to study! Haha... she's still chio lah, but... only the face now... it's really damn wasted, cause her character and overall physical appearance used to be really wonderful... but now, i guess, her weight pulls it all down... but... i still think, she's chio lah... Of course lah! she is my darling cousin lah! wah lau... hmm... but, you should see her when she was thinner, hope that she works towards that goal again! heex... but nevertheless, no matter what, i'll still love her all the same! :)  heex... anyway, i have more or less made my choice liao! haha... but... damn, i am still not prepared to make a step towards it, cause... i really am afraid of rejection at this point of time... ESPECIALLY, at this point of time... but... of course, i have to hope for the best and look at the brighter side of things lah! haha... Yup, that's all i can say about this one... But, i have found out another thing... as in, another interesting thing, not about the 2 girls whom i like, but rather about another girl... but this, i promised to shut up, so yup, i shall keep mum about it... the most important thing right now... Besides the LORD, is... to actually, settle my feelings for... the choice that i have made, cause i have realised how much she means to me... so... yeah...  To all that are down, Please cheer up... Whatever has upsetted you or got you down, there are always other people around the world who are more upset and have more reason to feel depressed... but... no one is blaming you... However, i just want you all to know this, no matter what is getting you down, no matter what has happened, you will always have a friend in GOD, and... certainly, have a friend in me! So... guys and girls... SMILE! :p
