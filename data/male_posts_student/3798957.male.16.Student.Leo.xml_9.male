I'm talking about PAX, of course. Penny-Arcade is super keen, and I'm gonna get to meet the creators and sit around staring at a screen for hours. According to the schedule, there will be a period around midnight where they kick everyone out for a hour or so, but after that it's back to work! I even get to play Halo2, which will also be neat. I gotta buy a fucking xbox. If anyone happens across this who is also attending, here's a fun fact: I'll probably be wearing an 3vil l33t shirt, and the rattiest fucking hat you've ever seen. Says "rugby, because" on the front of it. I love my hat, and have worn it for about six or seven years running now. It is an old hat. Maybe I should get it patched up or something before it's unwearable. PAX!!
