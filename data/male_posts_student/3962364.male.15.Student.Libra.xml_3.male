The rest of the night is going to go by very very slow. Im going to have to stay on late tonight. But if I stay up to late, I will be tired. But yes, first stop on the rest of my busy summer is "Camp Orlando". (See previous writings about Camp Orlando) I cant get away for 4 days from this house and from the River. The time away from here will go by too fast. But im looking forward to it. Its all good. Tune in 930 for my late night bloggin. I will deffinitly write more there and fill you in on the events on whats about to overcome us. till then. Adios
