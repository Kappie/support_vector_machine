While the first six Signs of the Zodiac focus on the individual, the last six focus on the individual's contact with others and with the world. Librans are first and foremost focused on others and how they relate to them. We can call this the Sign of partnership with a capital 'P' because these folks do not want to be alone! For a Libran, everything is better if it's done as a pair. Librans are good when paired up, too, since they epitomize balance, harmony and a sense of fair play. While they are true team players at work, their favorite partnership is at home: marriage. Librans feel most complete when they are coupled up with their lover, forever. It's the Scales which symbolize Libra, and just like that balancing mechanism wants to stay even, Librans want to be on an even keel. Think of the Scales of Justice and how they work at striking the right balance. Likewise, Librans are objective, just and want to do what's best for everyone. It's possible, though, that this penchant for fairness is for a different reason: Librans abhor conflict.  The Scales study every possible angle in the hopes of achieving peace and harmony, so much so that others may see them as fickle and indecisive. If that's what it takes to avoid a confrontation, that's fine with the Scales. The Libra-born are keen strategists, organizing groups with poise and getting the job done (in keeping with the Cardinal Quality assigned to this Sign). Further, you can expect the Scales to be companionable, sociable folks. Libra is ruled by the Planet Venus. In ancient Roman mythology, Venus was a smooth seductress who was at her best amid pleasurable excess. Well, Librans are certainly carrying the torch for her today. The Scales are cultured, refined and love beautiful things. Most of all, they love beautiful people, which is why Librans do so well at cocktail parties or at the theater, opera or ballet. Those born under this Sign always have the right thing to say and know how to make others feel comfortable. Suave? You bet. Librans are so adept at charming conversation that they need to be mindful of overstepping their boundaries and appearing vain or gossipy (the Scales do love intrigue). When these folks are on their game, however, they are a pleasure to be with. Librans are artistic, stylish and enjoy creating a beautiful world. The converse of this is that bored Librans can become apathetic and lazy -- but they'll smile anyway. The Element associated with Libra is Air, and that means reaching higher, specifically to the higher mind.  Librans like to put their mind to good use, and enjoy communicating their thoughts to others. They like to use their smarts (and talk) to get to know others better -- yes, knowledge about people is where it's at for Librans. You can expect the Scales to make a fair argument, too, since they live by the principles of diplomacy and compromise. When this approach doesn't work, however, Librans are not above using their persuasive charms to get their way. Manipulative? Nah, Librans really are too nice for that. Plus, any end-runs that these folks use are usually to build themselves up, since the Scales can be easily deterred. Librans are polite and don't like to fight, far preferring to talk things through. Remember, these folks know how to communicate (they're Air) so they're bound to make their point. Librans don't get in a huff when faced with an opposing viewpoint. Rather, they take a deep breath and consider all the options in the spirit of cooperation. Librans at play may not be as energized as at work, if you call socializing work (and the Scales do). That's why exercise for Librans needs to have a social component to it, such as that found at a gym. Alternatively, Librans love the outdoors, so riding and biking can also prove fun. They also love the colors of the sunset sky, that melding of ivory, pink and light blue. In the game of love, Librans are a bundle of energy, romantic and loyal to the core. The Scales need to be on the lookout for their lower backs, though, which tend to shoulder any burdens they may be carrying. The great strength of the Libra-born is their quest for fairness, peace and harmony. That the Scales are the great diplomats of the Zodiac further helps their case. A beautiful journey this will be, thanks to the Libran's inimitable sense of style.
