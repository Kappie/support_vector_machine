All my sister, her firend, and my mom did was go to the god damn pool and "lay out". What a waste. It sucked. I thunked about a lot of shit while I was gone and in the couple of hours since I've been back and caught up on some stuff. Dont get me wrong the vacation was better than being in Louisville and school.  It really sucks that school exists, next year will hopefully be my last at the hell hole aka Ballard. I'm hoping to transfer to Manual although my grades really suck so I might be stuck at the dungeon for the rest of my career. Chelsea wants to get out real bad nad her dad is going to talk to the principal and she wrote them a letter we shall see how it works out. But she wants to go to Waggener also which sucks because shes leaving away.   Soccer will start up on Tuesday and I will not be prepared. I was a fat ass on the break. I ate and drank and ate and ate and drank. On the last day I ate a whole 16 inch pizza by myslef. Thank You.  My sister called Pink Floyd boring I was pissed. She can fuck off, we got in an EPIC fight in the condo. But she acted like it was torture to listen to Floyd. And she forced me to endure My Morning Jacket. I like them for like 2 songs but the lead singers voie gets annoying and all the music sounds the same. Same wiht John Mayer and The Strokes, but lets not get started.
