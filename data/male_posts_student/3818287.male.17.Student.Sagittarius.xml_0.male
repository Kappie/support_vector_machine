My lady friend came over tonite along with another couple, Brad and Stef. I started the night thinking "I am going to kiss her." Haha, boy, was I wrong! We cuddled and all that but I just couldn't make the tranistion from hug to kiss. Is there some kind of treatment for Wuss-itis? I don't know why I couldn't do it. I mean, I've kissed girls before, but I can honestly say I didn't like any of them near as much as I like Kadey. Could it be because I like her too much and I don't want to rush into things? That's what I'd put my money on. Lord, why must you tease me so? Such a fickle game, this love thing is. So readers, here's the plan: My goal is to (finally) kiss her tomorrow. That would be Monday. And if I don't I give you all permission to kick me in my land down under. Deal? Sweet. Here goes nothing....  Chris  P.S. If you have anything to say to me, i.e. call me names, feel free to write them in the comments.
