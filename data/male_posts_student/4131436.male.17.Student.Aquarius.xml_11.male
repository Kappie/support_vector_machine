Lots of rough tacklings.. Hahaha!! No matter.. Had a great night yesterday.. Even though Jenni never come online.. Maybe she's busy or something.. Who knows.. It's ok.. Went to had breakfast with my homies.. Saw Jenni's friend Wendy at the hawker centre with her Mum.. Hahaha! She never noticed me.. Nah... Kinda bored today.. But my cousin's coming today.. He's staying over a couple of days.. Play some games..Most probably PS2.. Hahaha! That's for now though..Peace Out!!
