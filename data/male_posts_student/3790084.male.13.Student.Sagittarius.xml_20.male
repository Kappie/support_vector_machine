I don't know... And the worst thing is, i don't even know what am i doing now!!! This is really sulkening.  Targets , goals make people keep on competing to be better human being on this planet. When i ask myself, what's the target in myself.... i am absolutely no idea... people are quite shocked when they heard this because even a small kids know what they need to achieve.   There's thing i found out through my training is i dont suit in this ongoing IT world. I am asking myself , what makes me to take up IT course in the first place back in 3 years ago?? Because of interest?? because of no other choice?? I don't know! What i know is there is no turning point for me. What i can do is just finish up my degree and get the certificate. After that only plan which path i should go.  SUCCESS = HARD WORK + HARD WORK +HARD WORK
