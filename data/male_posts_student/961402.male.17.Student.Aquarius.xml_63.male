Specifiaclly the hot dogs that my brother Josh had left in the microwave without cooking, without a plate, allowing fun little hot dog juices to spill all over the microwave. When my mom opened the microwavve to see this, she was oderately upset and told Josh to clean it up. Despite having done nothing but watch television all day, Josh refused and quickly got into a shouting match with my mom. It escalated to the point where my mom slapped Josh, at which point Josh yelled "Go ahead, hit me again! huh?" Without thinking and overcome with anger, I walked over and hit Josh upside the head. A scuffle between him and me ensued, ending when he landed a good punch on my face. I took a step back, trying to figure out what to do next, but Josh had stopped fighting. My mom started yelling at him because now I would need stitches. "Why? I'm not cut." I said. She corrected me. Josh's punch had opened up a nice little laceration below my left eye. Josh was sent to his room and I got cleaned and bandaed up. I cried - it wasn't that my face hurt (a punch in the face actually hurts surprisingly little) but I always cry after fighting. Badness. Anyway, I got over it and got a bunch of ice in a bag on my face. My mom thought that I needed stitches, but I thought the cut wasn't that deep.  The next few hours (say, 5:30-7:30) were spent going about normal life with a bandaid and a patch of ice. Anybody who was in the Alcove IRC thingy - that was this time. When my dad got home and looked at the cut (which was still bleeding) he was afraid that it would leave a permanent scar if left unstitched. My dad insisted on bringing Josh along to the hospital, so the three of us packed into the car and went. On the way there my dad said he probably would have opted for the scar because it's 'cool to have scars'.  The wait at the hospital was short and everyone was really friendly-likeish. I got a vision test (I'm reguarly 20/30, but the eye above the cut actually improved to 20/25 in some bizzarre, Marvel-comicsesque injury sort of way). Asked how I got the cutbruise I told them that I had hit someone's fist with my face. They actually said that they could press charges for assault, but I declined. The surgeon (a nurse) was really nice, although dismayed to learn that my brother had gotten stitches just two days earlier (see 'Stitches and Scores'). We were out of the hospital less than an hour after we walked in and went for ice cream before heading home to sleep. My three stitches come out Monday, and I currently have a black eye.  Feeling better and life is back to normal. Re-applying for permit tomorrow, going to TMBG with John, Reuven, and the other mammals, and possibly seeing Laura on Sunday.  Almost makes me forget that my mom's sister's are arriving Sunday night.  Any and all comments welcomed.
