I need to get it replaced this summer, before my service plan expires. (Hmm… should I renew my plan?)  Ok so it says that battery is critical, but my computer has yet to turn off… so we’ll see how long this sucker can really last. I could be possible, that my laptop’s stupid and doesn’t know if there’s any juice in the batter or not.   It would be really cool though, if I got this problem solved earlier so that I can watch DVDs or something on my laptop. That’d be particularly cool on these cross country flights. I already slept 1 hr on the flight from Binghamton to Philadelphia, and then another 2 on this Philly to LA flight. The rest of the time I’ve been doing crossword puzzles and doodling in the complimentary magazine. There’s about an hour and a half left to this flight…  So in an hour and a half I’ll be back in California - the greatest state (directed at all those NY and PA people I know). I think the people who argue that NY only really use NYC as there point of reference. NYC is not representative of NY or any city in the world. When people call it the city, it really is THE city. LA is not the kind of city that most people think of when they think of cities. San Francisco maybe… Anyway… California has a more varied climate, population, economy, better schools, better bands, and hotter women. Oh man… Nancy’s gonna be posting some nasty comments when she reads this.  Inhye was laughing at me, because she was saying how obvious it was from the look on my face that I’m looking forward to going back to CA.   Something else… I’d like to point out that actions do not exist without a context. My actions come out of reactions.  My battery still seems to be working fine… after 15 minutes. Let’s see how long it’ll go!  The pilot just said we’ll be landing in about 1 hr.   I’m so excited about summer. I remember last year, I was happy about going home in the sense it was all about relief. It was about getting the hell out of Binghamton. This time around it’s not so much about getting out of Binghamton, as much as me being stoked about seeing friends, doing research, and lots of other stuff.
