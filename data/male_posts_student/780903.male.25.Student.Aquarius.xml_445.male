Well then come to [firm]'s promotional giveaway in the Hark on Monday, May 5th from 12PM – 3PM - where you can pick up your free study aids and learn more about this great firm."  Are we that pathetic?  Are highlighters, post-its, and a stress ball all we need for a firm to buy our love and affection?
