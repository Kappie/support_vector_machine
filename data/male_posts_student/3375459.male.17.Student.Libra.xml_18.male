Sorry if that's going to bore you.. but I’ve got nothing else to talk about, bear with me ok? Hhmmmm. Rarely have I got dreams that come day after day, or should I say 1day of nightmares and 2days of nice though weird dreams. The nightmare 2 nights ago was short, but it did its job.. It goes with me receiving an sms from the sister of a very important friend of mine saying”hoho… that’s it with you and her”.. Hey it was short, but it woke me up (checking my phone to see its for real) thank goodness.  Moving on to night 2, this one’s a little jumbled up. Firstly there’s this shared lunch in  Plazatech  (the whole place just looks like a combination of Plaza Singapura and Suntech City) got to tell u guys, that mall looks just so cool.. I’ll be lucky if I can still remember it and hand it up as my project someday. Back to my dream1, Hehehe.. it was then followed by a movie date.. Got the tickets, sad to say, they were the last 2 and it’s separated by an occupied seat. “WHICH SICKO WOULD TAKE A SEAT INBETWEEN A DATING COUPLE?” Oh ya. The theater just looks so much like the LT5 in SRJC… I can’t ever remember the movie. Then it was the arcade which looks more like an amusement park with rollercoaster, ferris wheel, cotton candy machines… and I had to wake up. Without walking her home!! Damn….   What’s so cool was that I continued with that dream this early morning.. Walking her home in the night, a quick good night and I woke up naturally with a smile..  Basically of the rest of the day I slacked.. Tried this new  No Hiang  my mum made.. What’s new? Smile =) coz its cheese! But it the taste of cheese only comes at the very last moment before I swallowed it. Arh, then I got so crazy over the Blitz gundam. I tried to make a model of it out of card boards a broken gundam and super glue after dinner. The layer of super glue on the card gives a plastic finish. Cool Huh? And I manage to make the front “skirt” of Blitz.. HEhehe okok.. I bored u guys out didn’t I? It’s getting late. Sweet Sweet Dreams to Everyone, NiteX ~_~…zzzZZ
