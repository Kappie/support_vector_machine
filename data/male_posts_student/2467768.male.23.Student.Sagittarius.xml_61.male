In his National Day message, PM Goh also urged Singaporeans to rally behind the new team of leaders taking over to help shape the country's future.      In retrospect, he recounted that Singaporeans had enjoyed seven years of 'bountiful harvests', followed by seven lean years, marked by the economic downturn and last year's devastating Sars outbreak  But Singaporeans did not give up, choosing instead to rally and fight back.  Mr Goh said that things are looking up again with the economy growing at 10 per cent in the first half of 2004, and the full year growth expected to be between eight to nine per cent.  In his speech telecast on Sunday night, Mr Goh shared key lessons he learnt over the years on how to keep the nation together and 'fly Singapore higher'.  Singapore's future, he said, depends on the commitment of its people to the country.  'Building a nation is not like building a block of flats. It is not just a matter of laying bricks and pouring concrete. Material wealth alone is not enough to root Singaporeans to Singapore,' he said.  Mr Goh said he believed that Singaporeans will treasure their country more when they feel valued and have the opportunity to shape its future.  He said the second critical factor to keep Singapore going is the trust between the different communities and the trust between the people and the Government.  PM Goh cited the discovery of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) network, after Sept 11 World Trade Center attacks in the United States, as an incident that shocked Singaporeans.  He said he was worried that it could break the trust between the Muslims and other communities here.  But he was relieved when Singaporeans, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, supported the Government's actions in making the JI arrests, and that they 'condemned the terrorist plot as the work of misguided individuals'.  Mr Goh mentioned that third critical factor for Singapore's future success is the quality of national leadership.   He said that Singaporeans 'are not naturally drawn to politics' so the Government has to 'systematically seek out good and able people and persuade them to become MPs and Ministers'.  Mr Goh also said that Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 52, who will take over the reins of power on Aug 12 had asked him to remain in the Cabinet, but did not elaborate on his role.  PM Goh said that DPM Lee and his team 'will face tough and different challenges ahead,' but he was confident that they are ready to take Singapore to a new level.
