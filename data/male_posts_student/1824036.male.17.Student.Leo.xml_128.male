Hairy Situation 2004-02-04, 06:03:34 PM  Today while eating a salad from the salad bar, I found a nasty, 10" long hair in my salad. First, I about puked. Then I decided, this is stupid...this is at least the third hair I have found in my food here. So I went to the lunch ladies and started to complain. They didn't care. So I yelled to everyone sitting near me to boycott the salad bar.  How fricking nasty!     New Where's George Link 2004-02-02, 10:32:46 PM  I just made a new Where's George link on my site. It will show all of the neat bills I have found. It can catergorize them by denomination, serial number, or federal reserve bank. It will show a picture of the front and back of the bill. Please go back to my homepage and check it out. It took me over 2 hours to do!     Snow Day 2004-02-02, 07:11:56 PM  Today at about 6 A.M. my dad came into my room with my dog and siad, "School is going to be two hours late." I smiled and went back to sleep...but not before I yelled at my stupid dog for chewing up something in my room. (I still dont know what she was chewing on)  Then I woke up at 11 o'clock and thought to myself, uh oh! I missed school! Then I heard my sister downstairs so I just figured what the heck, maybe there is no school today. Low and behold...no school. I went out to eat with my aunt from Kansas, my grandparents, my dad, and my sister. After that I attempted to go to Jadie's. Well, I got stuck in the 2' of snow in my driveway. I had to shovel my way out. Not cool.  I watched some movies at Jadie's then came home. And now that it is still snowing, I would probably bet on a two hour late start tomorrow. Or at least I hope so. I really dont want school, but I will take whatever I can get!     Snow 2004-02-01, 11:08:54 PM  Today it started to snow at about 3:00 P.M. It has been a slow sustained downpour of snow for around 5 horus or so...I hope that school is canceled tomorrow. Or at least I hope that it is delayed. Fort Dodge has already delayed their school 2 horus. I bet, if anything, we will get a two hour late start. Jadie really doesn't want to cancel school, she doesn't like to make up days, but I really dont care. I hope school is cancelled. I can go rent or buy a movie and watch it at Jadie's house.  Just in case you are new to my blog, Jadie is my girlfriend.     Patriots Win 2004-02-01, 10:14:55 PM  Once again my ritual has not failed me. I played guitar most of the time tonight, I even watched a little of the game...but most of the time I was playing guitar. After a while I got bored and played some basketball with Jordan, Sam B., and Tom B. We played 2 on 2 at first but then switched to the game of 21. I won of course.  But Peter, what about the commercials!?!  I did see a few commercials. Not too many. My favorite ones were the AOL 9.0 Optimized commercials. They hooked up the modem thing and their car/motorcycle took off like a bat out of...yeah. My other favorite commercial was the Pepsi commercial with Jimi Hendrix. Jimi was walking down the street. To his left was a a href="http://www.pepsi.com/home.php">Pepsi machine. To his right was a Coca-Cola machine. He chose the Pepsi and when he looked up, behind the Pepsi machine was a guitar shop. Then he looked across the street and behind the Coca-Cola machine there was an accordian shop.  Pretty good ending to a pretty good game. I really wanted the Panthers to win, but I figured that the Patriots would win. And the Patriots, of course, did win the Super Bowl in case you have your head in the sand. Congratulations to all of the Patriots, even though I dont like half of you guys. :P     Super Bowl Party 2004-02-01, 05:05:10 PM  There is a Super Bowl Party at my church. It is going to be awesome. Jadie is coming with me. Shorty, Tom and I are all going to rock out big time and learn to play some songs hopefully today.  As for the Super Bowl end of the party...I dont care a whole lot. I will probably just watch the last couple minutes of the game. Not like the game is going to be anything great. Its just the Patriots and the Panthers. Nothing too cool. If I had to bet money on the game, I would say the Patriots would win by 10 points. But I dont know, sometimes the NFC teams can be tough. Oh who am I kidding this game is going to SUCK!     Doing Just Fine 2004-02-01, 04:42:46 PM  After a very very scary moment in our relationship, Jadie and I are alright :) At least I think that we are all right.  Yesterday I bought Jadie some roses at Floral Creations in downtown Humboldt. They weren't exactly cheap...but I thought they were worth it. Especially since they were for Jadie :)  Today I went to the Country Club with her and sat there patiently while she ate. Then we came home and I ate some breakfast. I hope that we are fine. I dont see any signs of hostility anymore.  One more thing. Chad Boyce...Im very sorry for everything.     My New Blog 2004-01-26, 09:41:20 PM  Hello everyone and welcome to my brand new blog. I have been taught by Chad how to use my SQL with my PHP and when you throw them all into a can this is what you get. A very novice version of a blog. Made completely by me! I wonder if this will even work. Technically this is my test entry, but I will use it as my other entry too :) Thank heavens for Chad because even though I konw what I am doing, I still ask him a ton of questions every night. Thanks, Chad.
