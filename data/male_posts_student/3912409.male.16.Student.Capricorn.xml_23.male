At around 6:00 I headed down to BJ's house and Wes and Bret were already there. BJ was playing Megaman and he kept dieing... so I laugh at you, HA! A couple minutes later Dimitri showed up with Starsky and Hutch and Mario Party. We played Mario Party for like... 10 minutes until..... umm... we stopped playing it. When our pizza arrived we all sat down and watched Starsky and Hutch, it was my second time seeing it but it was still great. By the time it was over it might have been around 10:00-11:00... I really don't know what time it actually was, but meh. Ummm... I think I watched Wes or Bret play Warcraft for awhile... or me and Dimitri may have been playing games, but eventually we all ended up around the computer.  lol, why were there so many drunk girls.....  We started out on webcam with Ash and Steph and....... well..... they were drunk. They were dancing around all slutty like and they were sick and throwing up. Wes suggested they go to the hospital or something but they said no to that. And ummm... then we moved on to Cookie and her friends, they were drunk too... except for Cookie I believe. lol and yes, happy fun times. I sure hope nobody took any pictures of anything...... *shifty eyes*...... lol :p. lol and I hope my "dancing" in the "skirt" entertained you girls..... haha... I don't think so. And was my face really red? 'cause it was kinda hot in that small room with five guys and no windows....  When we all decided to go to sleep...... we ended up watching another movie at around 2:30. I watched the beginning of The Bourne Identity but fell asleep possibly somewhere in the middle of it. I think I woke up when the movie was over, and the others went to sleep.... and then woke up a couple minutes later. Wes, Dimitri, and possibly Bret stayed up all night playing games. When I woke up they were already on the computer and drinking their coffee, except for Bret who was still sleeping on the couch. I woke him up by plugging his nose.... lol... and he didn't exactly like that when he got up. I watched Wes on the computer for a couple minutes until BJ got up and then we played some games, possibly for 15 minutes. I then came home and am very tired because of the lack of sleep due to Wes and Dimitri.           lol and yes Cookie, I did see you when you had no shirt on and fell..... lol and you fell very fast :p
