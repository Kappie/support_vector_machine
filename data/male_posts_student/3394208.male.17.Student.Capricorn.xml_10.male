I just wandered on, going wherever my feet could carry me... effortlessly i walked on not having a care to where i would be headed... just follow your feet...  no need to look back... just walk on... no matter how tired you are... smiles, left and right... all flashing at me... damn you happy people... I'm envious of you all... i wonder what makes you smile? even in this  dark and gloomy day... damn you... while i trudge on these cold cold hard roads you mock me with your smiles... is it because you people know i can't? how placid must your lives be?  to not have a worry... to not ever draw a frown on your faces... to have all the time to do what you want to do... and how warm it must feel for you who has arms wrapped around you... damn you all... must you torment me with your laughs and giggles... must i always fulminate your actions... am i so garrulous about my hate towards happiness? why do i generate such anger? it must be the weather... everything is so abstruse... or must it be, i choose not to? i ponder on without sense... it is natural for me... i spot a woman, at first overwhelmed with sadness, but a message soon after came, and brought her much happiness... damn you... you are so fortunate... I tire of looking within... so much as in looking out...
