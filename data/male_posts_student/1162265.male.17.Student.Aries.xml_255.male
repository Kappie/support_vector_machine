I could go on and on, but it was sooo much fun, it completely eclipses the New York trip in the fun-ness factor.  The show itself was so filled with running back and forth, and stress, but it was all good.  I was really hyped after, and eating dinner after didn't even get rid of the hype.  So when I got home at around 10:40, I watched an hour of TV and tried to sleep, but every time I was about to doze off I'd flashback to FNL and be wide awake.    So today I was pretty sad.  I guess consolation was that I was able to talk to Sonya.
