But it does annoy me when it decides it no longer needs a clutch cable, and therefore snaps it. And poof! I'm without a car for a few days. Without transportation of my own, without the ability to go anywhere whenever, without, in a word, freedom. Now, when I use the word 'freedom' in this context, I am talking about the lesser sort of freedom that only involves choice, and not truth. It's not vital to my free will, but I like it anyway. My current situation reminds me of that terrible age of 15, when you're oh so close to being able to taste the freedom of driving. Now, when I was fifteen I was in my recluse stage. I call it my isolationist period, like the US before the Great War. I just didn't like people: I preferred to be by myself and slip deeper into some ridiculous depression. I think back to that time period because my situation now is very similar, but very different in a very important sense. Back then, my inability to drive was an excuse to stay at home and avoid people. These past few days, on the other hand, I have been bumming rides every day so that I can do things and be with people. Rather than spend the whole day at home, I spend the whole day with whoever is kind enough to let me ride in their car. Yesterday, it was A to the J. Today, who knows? Anyway, not having the ability to leave home on my own accord makes it that much more difficult to stay here. It would be fine if my car was waiting in the driveway, because then I would have comfort in the knowledge that I was here on my own free will, not because I couldn't leave. It's strange how inherently rebellious we humans are. We can't stand feeling like we're not choosing our own paths. If we're denied something, we try and attain it ... simply because we hate being denied. It's like the basic flaw with legalism. The human mind can't process negatives. If I tell you, "Don't think about a zebra," what do you automatically think of? The part that matters to your brain is "think about a zebra." So if you tell somebody not to slam the door, you're just making them think about slamming it. They probably wouldn't have given it a second thought if you hadn't told them not to. It's like those booklets they always hand out during the first few weeks of school - something about Standards for Discipline, or some such nonsense. In that little booklet are hundreds of things students are not allowed to do. I would never have thought of most of those things if they weren't specifically listed in there. Those problems are the reasons why I think so many Christians have the wrong focus. We get so caught up in  not sinning  that all we think about is  sinning . It's important not to try to process negatives, but to think about what we  should  be doing.
