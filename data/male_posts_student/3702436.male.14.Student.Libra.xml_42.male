'I wish we never had to choose,  To either win or lose,  That we could find a way...'    ri/ex-ri ppl:  im so proud of u c div. just like last yr nobody counted on u to win. but u did amazingly well. i know some of u got fairly emotional after u ur competition. just wanna say its totally alright as long as u dont get too wrapped up with it. nxt weeks is the artistic comp, for the artistic ppl do ur best again like this time round and nobody will blame u for everything. i know we've said b4 ur training attitude was fubared and all, and to be honest i still dont think too much of it now. but im sure u will all rise up to the challenge and mature after the whole thing is over. u have to. keep the flag flying.  b division, i know we know they know we were the mightest team that day but it just wasnt to be. u know that nobody is blaming everybody because we're all 1 team. nxt yr jenhan n i wont be arnd too often( im nt even sure whether i'll be arnd at all) but its important for you to  bounce back from this  and emulate this year's performance. and remember its the process that counts, not the result.  and to all the old ppl who came back: like xavier, big ming, fats, and andy too. u all were the moral boosters of it all because everyone still remembers ur era and im sure that u had encouraged us all the way and supported us. i cld tell by the scandalised faces when jenhan's score came out how bloody disgusted u were...even though u've got no official affiliations with ri anymore...i guess thats one of the few things that set ri apart from some other schs. thanks for being there ppl and esp andy: thnx for e encouragement yelling and coaching frm sec 1 i had doubts about joining gym in jc but after this no more. we'll pown nxt yr.   sji ppl:  its been a quite a fun time this yr because u ppl are the greatest; u've got the nearly the same training ethic, lameness, determination as us! its been another year with a similar result, and it ended wif a similar cheer (*grins*). look forward to dinner a taka on fri night..n greater interaction wif u guys in time to come..both as sji and sji old boys...:D   chs ppl:  i have really nothing much to say to you about you. just that im really happy im not from chs...its like win n ppl villianise u. lose and ppl still villianise u. aint a nice life i admit.  in general:  this year has been a nice roundoff.  sec1: appealed into gym from rv(choir). got shunted/pushed/put into tramp at the end of the year.  sec2:screwed up my c div with a single facedrop but got a screwedup score anyway. just like jenhan felt demn jacked n cheated coz of e team bronze.  sec3:screwedup so bloody badly and kinda cost the team gold.  sec4: screwedup only slightly; i personally feel i did quite well overall.  but its all the team that counts in the end. we've really embodied team spirit in a way i never thought would be possible in gymnastics. we've epitomised grit, determination, enthusiasm, fun. we've trained bloody hard and finally i've done a routine during comm i cld be proud off. maybe there are ppl who think its gr8 tt we've pawned us..maybe there are ppl arnd who think we've losers because we cldnt even sniff the gold in 3 years of competition..to those ppl i suggest u go rethink ur thinking.   'Stand tall; Stand proud!  Voices that care are crying out loud.  And when you close your eyes tonight,  Feel in your heart how our love burns bright.'
