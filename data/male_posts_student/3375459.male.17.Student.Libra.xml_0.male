(flash back) Still remember that its was the first late night movie I ever went in Singapore with all the other red cross members, but before that, we had dinner at Mount Faber. Such a romantic place, but it was ruined with us around. HEhhee... Kids playing with sparker in the dark, and couple cuddle up together. Amazing how I could still remember.   Alright~ After dinner, we hopped back on to our rented bus and made our way down to Suntech City. It was late man, first time I saw so many shops close in there. Don't think I need to go into details for the movie, so it was back to camp after the movie.  (Present) I would like to go for another late night movie man. HAhaha...
