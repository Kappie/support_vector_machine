We were wondering what you thought about Steve entirely existing and purely being a man slaughtering ravenous manically blood driven pet, a monster that truly exists but the rest of the gang doubts the existence of until Cameron has to prove Steve's existence, or Steve existing entirely in Cameron's sub-conscious until he is yanked forth from some kind of odd situation?  Or anything else for that matter...  Just post your comments, and we'll be all,  "Woah...your ideas suck ass..."  haha, just messing. Thanks in advance people.  p.s. Steve came from Lake Berryessa in so. CA
