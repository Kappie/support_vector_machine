Now I know Matt has promised all of you some spectacular rants coming from me (which there will be I assure you) due to my "unique bitchyness", but not today. Lately I've been kinda morose due to.........situations completely out of my control. Today, for instance, I spent all day in my room, studying for my english and social diploma exams, listening to some of my compilation disks that I've made over the years. As I'm listening a track comes on that I hadn't heard in a while, and I really like the song, it's  Broken Words  by  Finger Eleven . As i'm listening the course comes on and the lyrics go " She's the one who saw my words, broken, torn at the seams. And broken words are all she heard, now she's walking away from me ." At this point I realized that I was crying, a lyric made me cry. Now for those who know me they should know that that is not like me at all, but there I was laying on my bed, books in front of me with tears in my eyes. Now I'd like to end this little introspection with a quote, actually another lyric -  "Walk into this world with your head up high" - Deftones
