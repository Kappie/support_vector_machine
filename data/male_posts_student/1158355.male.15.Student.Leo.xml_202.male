We watched Dragonfly, then Children of the Corn (which is the cause for the cornfield setting in my dream and this movie is also a song by Korn only it's spelt Children of The...and I guarantee you all know how they spelt corn.) Damn that was a long parenthasis. Then watched some pimp my ride. Then we all went home. I was gonna sleep over but I couldn't because I had to babysit my sister in the morning, but it was more like being home and sleeping while she exists in the house. My dad took me to Wendy's 12 at night. Good night, I mean my night was good. Now I'm gonna talk about my dream. My dreams are really weird. This is what happened. I went to a Splish Splash in Florida, and I think I've already been here in a way previous dream. So, that's not important, we went to someone's house. I think it was my parents friends or something. I think Bobby Perdue was there. So we went into a cornfield and we're walking down the street/cornfield and all of the sudden I here BOOM and a plane is flying down from the sky and crashes like 20 feet away from us. It was a little red one person plane. I somehow carried the pilot area home (it weighs what, 500 pounds?) but it became miniature when I held it. Then guy was falling from the sky and he put his parachute on and landed on the ground on his neck. Then a random news report came from the sky saying a man had landed on his neck but he was fine because he went through a new break through technology surgery. Ladies, I strongly advice you do not read on from here. The surgery was they cut off big guys heads (no not the head above your neck, the one above the shaft) and took the skin and put it on people's actual skull like a helmet for your skull. They even showed the operation and the guy was screaming of torture...god this is sick. So anyways. We meet some ladies. And I do my Rick James voice and say ya know, "Ladies, come over here and have sex with Charlie Murphy" which was really Bobby. But then I saw the big 2 guys and I said, "You know, I don't have a family, it would be nice to hang out with you people." He just grunted. Confusing as hell. If your still reading this, congradulations, you're a moron. I spelt 'gradulations wrong. ANAWYAS, it was just this girl and I. And she just started touching me. But before anything happened I woke up because the phone rang DAMNIT I ENJOY MY PSYCHO SALVADOR DALI DREAMS! If you really wanna hear more dreams and if you're STILL reading this being the major moron you are ask me personally. You'll be freaked. I think I have another world in my dreams. Yes, another universe, it all makes sense now.
