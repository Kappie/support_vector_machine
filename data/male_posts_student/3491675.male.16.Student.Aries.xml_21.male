This was due to the fact that my mom and I got into a ridiculous squable about the elusive yet out of all the  reason's to fight about we fighted about "CLOTHES", this is one of those anoying fight's were we start talking about something and lead's to another subject like why my grades are sometimes bad, she knows im smart it's just that i get distracted easily, and this leads to something else and more fighting. After an 2.5 hrs we calmed down and were like okay. Afterwards i was still feeling moody, but it wasn't regular moody this was a different kind of moody the mood i was feeling was differnt it was a type of feeling where it feels as though you're soul is flying but yet is imprisoned underground, i feel happy but sad at the same time, more in tuned but out of my sense's, the type of feeling where shadow's whisper seductive things to you're soul and so forth. i was trying to understand the  reason behind my emotions when i started feeling this way i was like Okay i feel this way after a fight, i feel sad but connected none the less, in the end i just gave up trying to understand my emotions since i will never understand them completely. This thought sometimes makes me wonder or contemplate?
