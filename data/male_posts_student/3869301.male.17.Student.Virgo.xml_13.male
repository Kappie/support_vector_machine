Stylish yet not overdressed for many average things.  I think it was this morning... I had breakfast with k-ray. I foregot how much I really do enjoy her. Just her being around makes me smile, but I don't know how to tell her this. I have never known. I have had these feelings for years. Times fades around her. If only she would ever give me a hint that she might, MIGHT, feel even sort of the same for me... Oh, I don't know what I would do.
