I wish i could be good enough and enter a clan or championship, i will get famous!   Also did some shopping with my mom, checked some furniture. Walking down the street i found something completely crazy! A shop that sells magics cards! Godamn it, i was so happy. I bough a booster pack of Darksteel and got a few good cards, i will add them to a green deck today.   Nothing new except that, i was out pretty much all day long. My brother Simon annoyed me a lot to get my Xbox. He will probably continue to do so...   Spoke a bit with  Michelle , she is cool, but afraid of everything. Wonder why...  Regards,  Zephyr
