Yes the lack of real Asians as important characters, except for as prostitutes was kind of annoying. However, the storyline involving political conspiracy, brainwashing, crazy parents, etc. was great.    Catch Me if you Can  was pretty neat too. It's hard to believe it's a real story. For a real person to do all that before he turned 19 is amazing.  It's the usual Sunday sloth today... I'll get some writing done later. I've noticed I like writing at night better.  I've got a potato baking in the oven... they take forever, yet they're so worth the wait.  I just realized that with the days in Binghamton dwindling, my grocery shopping will have to be cut back. I don't want all these things that I can't finish in the next few weeks and that I'll have to throw away.  ***
