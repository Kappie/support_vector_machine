And looking back through the entries, I realized that I am fairly mean when it comes to that sort of thing. I'm not like that in person. Really. I swear. I only bring this up because I'm about to do it again. This time, the target will be: my friends! Well, not my friends in particular, but the "clique" my friends (and me by association, I regretfully suppose) belong to: the pseudo-goths. You know the type: the kind that think they're really cool and rebellious because they wear black, when in reality it just makes them look stupid? Those kind. To their credit, my friends aren't so much like that now as they were a year ago or so. But there's a new wave of them coming in to my school every year and  they need to be stopped . Now don't get me wrong, Idefinitely believe in the expression of individuality. But that's just the thing. The pseudo-goths are not individual in any way. They're just as much a flock of sheep as the "preps" that they try to separate themselves from. They all wear black. They all shop at Hot Topic. They all wear chains. They all listen to the same music (emo and metal). And they all hate the "preps". Why do they hate the preps? They don't have a good reason for it, other than those were the kids that picked on them in middle school. And I hated them too, in middle school. But you know what? We've all grown up. And I've discovered that a lot of the people I dismissed as "preps" are actually pretty cool.Changing the subject (kind of),I just realized that anyone out of high school won't be able to relate to this post. Well, whatever. This post isn't for you. This post is for the people I just described. As heartbreaking as it may be for you to hear, you are not a nonconformist. You are even more of a conformist than the people you label as conformists. Quit dressing like you were struck by a brain hemorrhage while you were picking out your clothes, and quit trying so hard to stand out. If you just act like yourself,  you will stand out.
