Woohoo. Today was just as boring: I began the driving portion of my drivers' ed class today and boooooy did it suck. Not so much that I drove poorly, but more that he made me follow every damn rule in specific...I thought I was going to explode. I've been thinking about the paper we have to write for history and I think I've decided to do 'ol Willy...that's Shakespeare, dumbass. Yeah. My neck hurts. Hmm...maybe if I took some medicine for it. Juggies are cool. When ice melts in water, it makes this cool half-water, half-milk mixture. I'm still single. Yep..single.... I beat badgers with spoons.
