It rolled around at roughly 12:00 this morning (yes, midnight) with 40 mph winds and tried to kill eveything but, since it was a wimpy storm, it only shut off the power from a few places. Of course, no one in the US will hear about it because NO ONE HEARD OF IT IN THE FIRST PLACE ON JULY 22! Of course, everyone knows about New York (bitter mumbling).  Mars is supposed to be closer to the earth tonight than it has been in 60,000 some odd number years. The ruby of earth's neighbors. Or the rust spot. I like to think of it as the ruby. Look for it tonight, chaps, it supposed to be a wonderful view.
