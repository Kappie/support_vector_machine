You can find most of the guestbooks I'm going to talk about on the Blogger Help pags for guestbooks.  I have three that I'm going to talk about, and I have used two before.  The first one is HTML Gear.  This product is from Lycos, and is relatively easy to set up, but, its not the best one.  You can set up an account, which gets you all sorts of other addons and things for your blog, and then create your guestbook, copy the HTML, and add it onto the sidebar on your blog, or whereever.  The next one is iGuest.  This one is the one that I currently use here on Digital Lust, and also on Blog of Bagel, and it works great.  Its easy to setup, and the interface is simple showing up on your blog... it's a good one, and I'm going to recommend this more than any other one that I review.  And, finally, the last one I'm going to talk about is Ultraguest.  This one has a nice interface, and is easy to use, and fits right into your blog.  It's not that popular yet, and its not as good as iGuest, but, it may change eventually.  So, I am going to recommend that you use iGuest for your guestbook needs over anything.  Tomorrow, for Friday Tips, I will have two tips, one about HaloScan, and the other about finding new skins.  And that will wrap it up for Blogger.   Up next on Digital Lust, in about half an hour, today's site of the day, Rotten Tomatoes!  Check it out!
