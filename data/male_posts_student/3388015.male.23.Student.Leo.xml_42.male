Laura and Luke throw a much better dinner party and they had tacos!  So I headed there and hung out.  Laura and Luke seem to always do the right things at the right time.  Laughing, crying, Simpsons.  A good night at the Osborne/Cowan's shack. :)  Quote:  "One of my co-workers drinks your tea." Me "Salada?" Other Luke "That'salata Salada." Laura
