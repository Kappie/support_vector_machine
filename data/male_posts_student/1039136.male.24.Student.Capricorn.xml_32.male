I went to publish it, but since it was sitting there for three days, it needed to refresh the connection with the posting site and I lost everything.  My dumb ass didn't copy the stuff out before hitting the button, so I lost it. 2 words.. Oh Well.  To summarize that one and move on to bigger and better things, The post was mainly about how something happened where I decided to look back on the last three years of my life. I listed many of the important events and decisions I made over the last three years and in doing that, I realized how fast life moves.  You have to make every moment count and bla bla bla...Here is all that matters now but tomorrow yesterday when you look back you want to be able to have things that you want to remember.  Anyway, on to more important things. The wvZOO has opened, not officially though. Grand Opening is the end of April/first week of May. For those of you who don't know what The Zoo is, it's not a zoo at all. There are all sorts of indie bands all over the place. That's how most bands other than "Da Band"(which isnt even a band) start out playing. The Zoo is now one of these places where these bands can get a start. Don't ask me who, because I have no clue about the bands, I'm not there for that. I'm there to assist Joey and Brad whenever they need help running things and security and all that. There's also another reason i'm at Zoo a lot. After almost three years of not wrestling because of whoever and whatever...i'm going back to it.  By the way, fuck you if you don't like that..I honestly dont give a shit. I dont laugh at you because you're a pussy. Now the building that The Zoo is housed by is going up for auction, so hopefully either the new owner buys back his own shit, or the new owner keeps at least The Zoo intact. Its an awesome place, and its good to be around my real brothers..If there's anything close to being a real fraternity, and real brotherhood, it's the guys that have been involved in wrestling and the underground since it has started.  There's even pledging..but it's wrestling training, where you basically get the shit beat out of you for months..literally. One of the trainees had a fist size bruise on his back.  I'd like to see half of these so called greeks at esu go through something like this.  Oh yea..and we don't do community service..we'd rather beat the shit out of each other for charity than help and old lady cross the street like the face version of Superstar Brian Charisma.  Ok..out of that bubble..I don't know where my life is going day to day right now. Thats alright too, because i'm really getting into this living day by day shit.  In living my life, i piss people off..and i'm glad, because that means I'm real. As Pimp Daddy Ice T said last nite in his spoken word thing, you aint gonna make everybody happy...everyone wants to be happy and it overlaps with someone else's  trying to be happy, so its gonna piss them off.  BINGO.. hey if you dont like what I do..how i run my life..how i make my money, whatever.  If you think i should "just graduate already," good for you bitch..i think you should choke on a fucking dick.  I do what i feel fits my life. See that..MY LIFE.  Don't like it..aww cry me a river...I just DON'T CARE.  Oh well..its lunch and then gym time..I'm not gonna sit here and write more just so you have something more to read. Why?..because I JUST DON'T CARE!1
