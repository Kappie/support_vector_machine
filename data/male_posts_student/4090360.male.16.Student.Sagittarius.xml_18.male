Heres your  urlLink funny video of the day  Oh and I just found a very cool band named  urlLink Further Seems Forever . They are a band under the label Tooth & Nail (Toby Mac's company) meaning that they are most likely a christian band. They play them on christianrock.net so its safe to say they are christian, which rocks.  -The statement below is true. -The statement above is false.
