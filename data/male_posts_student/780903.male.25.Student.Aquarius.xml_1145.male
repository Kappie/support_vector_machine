What I didn't mention yet is that each day there's a "word of the day" on the screen.  On Thursday, the word was "defenestrate" -- to throw someone out of a window.  I think someone at the elevator-screen company has a sense of humor.  Here we are, in an elevator heading up a 50-story building -- and you've got to assume a building's gotta be pretty tall for them to bother paying for this system -- and the "word of the day" means throwing someone out a window?  I'm just about on the fortieth floor!  This is not what I want to be thinking about on my elevator ride!  I'm waiting for next week's words -- blackout, terrorism, nerve gas, anthrax, and random shooting.  These are not things I want to think about while I'm trapped inside a tall building.  Sorry.  And with that...  "Thirty-Third Floor, Please"  [Two older women get on an elevator.  There's a video screen in the elevator.  RUTH stands near the buttons.  SARA stands on the other side.]  SARA Can you press 33 for me?  RUTH Sure.  I'm on 31.  You work for the law firm?  SARA Yeah.  You work for the consulting firm?  RUTH Yeah.  I'm Ruth.  SARA What?  Sorry, I was distracted by the screen.  13 children dead in a licorice accident.  It's quite a tragedy.  RUTH Oh, the screen.  Yes, it's quite something.  SARA Isn't technology amazing.  They've even got the weather.  Apparently it's 62 on the ground, but 59 up where we are.  Well, 59 on 33.  Maybe it's 60 on 31.  I don't know.  RUTH I hate the screen.  SARA What?  Sorry.  The Dow is up 14 and a half.  It was only up 14 and a quarter when we got on.  Banner day on Wall Street.  RUTH I had all my money in tech stocks.  Lost a bundle.  Good thing my husband left me a nice chunk of change after the sponge cake accident.  SARA What?  Sorry.  The word of the day is chlamydia.  That's interesting.  RUTH My daughter has that.  SARA Your daughter?  What floor does she work on?  RUTH She doesn't work here.  She lives in Idaho.  She's a seamstress.  SARA What?  Sorry.  Betty White turns 79 today.  I loved her in that chicken commercial.  RUTH This isn't much of a conversation.  You keep distracted by the screen.  SARA Sorry.  What?  I'm distracted by the screen.  RUTH Yes, that's what I said.  SARA The dollar's down against the Yen.  Shocking news from the world markets.  RUTH The elevator's slow today.  SARA Time flies when you read the screen.  And look -- the animal of the day is the salamander.  I love salamanders.  They're so cute.  RUTH Is everyone on 33 as friendly as you?  SARA What?  Sorry.  The latest poll shows kidney beans are twice as popular as chick peas.  I never would have guessed.  [The elevator rings.  RUTH gets out.]  RUTH Have a good day.  SARA What?  Sorry.  Milk can feel pain.  Fascinating.  {Blackout.}
