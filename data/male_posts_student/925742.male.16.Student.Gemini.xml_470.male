I got my tuxedo sizes in for my sister's wedding and got a cd player for my 94 ford escort LX.  WOOOO!  I even got some of my Latin done!  Yeah!  While going to best buy my dad said something like this:  "I AM AZN!  I honor my ancestors by ricing out my Civic and painting HONDA on the sides!  I also ate rice once!  I put a huge wing on it!  AZN PRYDE!"  AND I FUCKING LAUGHED MY ASS OFF.  Now I don't know, I have a few hours to do stuff.
