Sure traffic coming back was kind of annoying, but it was a cool experience. I'm really having fun with this research. This is my first time really doing real history research and I'm having fun with it. Being able to research whatever you want is great. Although it is getting harder locating primary documents for this paper. I have 2 pages so far for my biliography and about 7 pages worth of typed up notes. I wonder how much more I need. I know I need to explore more of the right's perspective on films. I also have to look into subjects such as censorship and more on the Spanish civil war.  Aside from that nothing really exciting. I had lunch with Mark at the pub and as usual when we have lunch, we talk politics. Good stuff.  ****
