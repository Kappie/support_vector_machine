I can't believe that Canadians are stupid enough to put Martin back in power.  He wasted billions on the sponsorship scandal and will send this country down the drain.  He's giving the final hit on the head to the nails that Trudeau put in our coffin 20 years ago.  And Jack Layton, don't get me started on him.  Give the man a fucking hammer and have him hit fruit.  He looks and acts like that Gallagher comedian guy.  Harper, now there's a leader, he would've led this country to economic prosperity, with low taxes and increased federal funding.  But you Canadians made your choice, and now you're gonna have to live with it.  I commend all the Conservative candidates accross the country, for a campaign well done.  Even though you couldn't all win, you made a dent in the Liberal stronghold of the past.  In the next election the conservatives will see power.  I forsee an election in a years time and hopefully the Liberals won't live to see the end of it.
