I had spent the entire day playing Sonic Adventure 2 (a Dreamcast game) and Ragnarok Online. My Chao (the cute, cuddly pets in SA2) asked me a question, "What's the meaning of life?". She then answered the question herself (I'm typing her reply back through memory), "Life is to be happy, sad and excited. I should live my life based on these three emotions".  Sad, but this Chao (whom I named Hikari) makes me feel a bit happier. Like there's a light shining through my question about it. I shall soon post a picture of her.  Be right back at you. I'm gonna grab a bowl of instant noodles.
