'twas very fun and i actually got back to the skill level of where i used to be. so im not that horrible now. i went down to the "skatepark" (its a slab of concrete with a box, a few highway dividers, and a pyramind) at about 8 this morning. yes i said 8 this morning. i was actually able to do quite a bit of stuff. i actually manualed the box which was very very surprising. i managed to throw down some other things as well, but now i dont feel so bad about skating whenever i think of Boyd's video. i dont think i will ever make it to where they are, but skating is all about fun. kohler, you should heed this advice. anyways, i think i'm gonna go and skate a little more now. happy summer, kids.
