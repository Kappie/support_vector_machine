Save everything in Yahoo Briefcase.  Then find which pages of my reference book to photocopy. Then go photocopy lorhz.    Tomorrow -     Download everything from Yahoo Briefcase.  Print them out.  Bind everything up   Hand it up.   Be happy.     2 hours to complete the last part tomorrow only. Dont know got enough time mahz. Very sianz. Actually should just take away the Be Happy part. Cuz after handing in, my proposal might not get high score and I need to stress myself to do the actual project.   This weekend lehz? Might go out with him. Maybe only. Chance are slim. If not. I will be studying. I wouldnt want to fail. I believe Im quite far behind in my class. Shit... Thanks to my skipping of lecture here and there... Then today I skipped a 2 hours lab lesson. What the hell...  School is so stress... I dont realy understand what I'm learning. Even if I go to lecture, I will still be having this problem.   Life sucks.
