One species of vegetables can not be like a multi-vitamin tablet. I thought that this concept is obvious, but it seems not.  In the movie,"Super size me", there is a interview to a high school student at the cafeteria. She grabed fries and said, "This is my vegetable!". If this is the only case that somebody said, I would not care so much, but I had another chanse to hear the same opinion. It was in the making film of the movie "School of Rock" starred by Jack Black. When he grabbed a burger and fries, he said the same thing to the camera man.  It could be only in my family in Japan, but when I was a kid, my mother told me that necessary nutritions for human body in a day are equivalent to ones  from 30 verious ingridients. It is very difficult to use and cook 30 ingridients  in a meal.  I guess there is no or little education about nutritions in junior high and high schools.  For a dinner, only cheese pizza? C'mon!
