Shit, I'm soo tired and so knackered... my knees, my legs, my chest... I've been cleaning windows, scrubbing tables, hoovering floors, moving tables and chairs, sweeping, boucning to Linkin Park.... ok, so only one of those things was fun... and the boss, Mr Moon Lam-Nip (YES, that's his name) is worse than Hitler, Hitler just wanted to rule the world. Nip wants to destroy my body... its like bein raped by a fat black man... not that I've experienced it before...        Apparently hoovering on ur hands and knees cos ur 6ft3 and cant reach the sodding floor bending down constitutes as not working... well I'd like to see him trying to clean the damn celing without using a bloody chair.... *fume*       Anyway... I'm tired now... really tired, and I've got weeks left of this, so I wont be writing much at length, but hopefully will be posting lots of shorter things to fill up the spaces.     Peace and utter crippling knee pain.  Dxx
