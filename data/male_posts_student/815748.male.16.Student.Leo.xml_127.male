People were also making fun of when Hiro apparently bowed at the trial before he gave his closing; Elliott joked that that was ok but it was really strange when he took his shoes off at the beginning.  Haha, Asian people are Asian.  I also wrote my working paper on Iraqi elections today, and depending on on how much of my other work I procrastinate, I may write the resolution too so I can garner enough signatories and submit it at the meeting tomorrow.  It's posted on the Yahoo! Groups site, but here's a copy; keep in mind that I myself represent Iraq:   General Assembly Iraqi Elections Working Paper  The authors of this working paper affirm the inalienable right of the Iraqi people to govern itself in a fashion consistent with democratic and traditional purposes.  To that end, we propose:  1. That, upon the request of the Iraqi transitional government, the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) be commissioned to advise said government and to facilitate, oversee, and safeguard the upcoming elections for the National Assembly;  2. That, if it is deemed necessary to Iraqi national security and is done under the full consent of the Iraqi transitional government, the United Nations send peacekeepers to establish and maintain security in situations relating to the establishment of the future permanent government of Iraq and elections thereto;  3. That the authority of the Iraqi transitional government and the future permanent government, and the rights of the people of Iraq under international agreements and under the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL), be fully respected in all aforementioned and other actions of the United Nations;  and,  4. That the predominance of the TAL be officially recognized as the framework of Iraqi government during the transitional period, the document entrusted with the responsibility to begin the future permanent government of Iraq, and the foundation of the future permanent constitution of Iraq; maintaining a democratic and republican course which secures the liberties and principles of self-determination for a free people of the world.
