And for those of you who are confused about why it extended my dinner, here's a look at how my schools dinners work;  There are 3 half hour sections, 2 of then are used for lessons, 1 used for dinner. It means dinners are at different times every day...well...different times during period 4...4.1, 4.2 and 4.3...  Your all probably confused at that...so i'll go now :P
