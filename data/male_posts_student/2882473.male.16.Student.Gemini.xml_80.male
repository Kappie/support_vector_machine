So, the reasons why I haven't posted. These would mainly include the computer trouble I am having at the moment. I shall describe the problem. Internet Explorer is buggered up. Every time I change page, it crashes/freezes for about a minute or so, possibly more. (If you have any possible solutions, then leave a comment or email me, this desperately needs fixing, although it may be an excuse for a new computer...) As you can immagine this gets rather annoying after a while, as it takes about half an hour to go to about 3 web sites. So I decided to stop using it as much as I had done. In fact, I have only been using the computer for no more than 30 minutes every day, which is probably for the best, as I do kind of have exams at the moment. Well, not right now, obviously, as I would not be blogging if I did. We don't use computers in exams (not even in the computer exam) And even if we did, I would not waste my time blogging, I would be doing the questions, unless it was a piss-easy exam like the IT one we had a while ago, when it lasted and hour and a half and we all finished within 45 minutes. I'll shut up now...  Ok, the second reason why I haven't been blogging much. I felt that I should do revision. After all, I do have both English AND geography tomorrow. What a chiz, two exams on the same day... But we had two on Monday, and it wasn't too bad. The First one was geography decision making, for which I had already prepared an answer to the last question for, and the questions weren't too bad. Example: What is the populaiton of Shrewsbury? *looks through resource book given to us* Ah, it was XXXX I can't actually remember the answer, but I'm fairly sure it was correct. :)  When that was over, me and my good friends decided to do a bit of revision for the impending doom of biology later that day. After about half an hour of sitting in the sun in the junior playground, we decided to go and eat some food, as break time was nearing, and the playground would soon be swarming with small children, whome for some reason I despise. The lary bastards... I'll get 'em one day... Ok, then after break, not wanting to do any more revision, we decided to go for a walk in the woods, situated behind the astro-turf thing. It was quite a nice walk, during which we saw plenty of interesting items. Old bath tubs, fridges, and the odd tree or two. Walking round for about 20 minutes, we headed back, as we discussed the possible outcome of a fight between Hogwarts teachers (from the Harry Potter books, if you didn't know) and the Jedi Council (You really should know that they are from Star Wars). We didn't really come to a conclusion, I was thinking Jedi would win, as they can see events before they happen, but then what if a wizard dissaperated? Or 'Accio lightsabre, transfigue to useless stick'? Then of course a jedi master could do force lightning. Or use the force to summon a wand and snap it. Yes, me and my friends are this geeky. We discussed the possibilities for quite a while. Back in the school hall, we did a bit more revison, and just talked for a while until lunch time, when we ate, then went to the biology exam. It wasn't too bad, but it would have been better if my nose hadn't been dripping through the whole thing, and I only had two tissues. And the heat wasn't swealtering. But it didn't go too badly.  Ok, another reason why I haven't been blogging. Yes dickybod, I will keep the reasons comming. I have been reading :) Yep, reading is great fun, much more fun than revising anyway. I can get at least 75 pages done every day. I finished  urlLink 'Guards, Guards'  only this morning, which I must reccomend to all. Excellent book, rather funny too. And now I have decided to read the Harry Potter books again, as I haven't read one for about a year. Or whenever book 5 came out. I'm already at about chapter 6 or so. I'll aim to have all 5 read by... by the end of the exmas. Yes, just under 3 weeks. A nice challenge for me. Yes, I should be revising, but that's rather dull.  That should do with reasons for not blogging for now. If you want more dickybod, you're not getting them.  So, what have I been doing today. Well, as I said, I have been reading those 2 books. Guards, Guards and Harry Potter 1, if you have forgotten already. I have also made noted on nearly all the case studys that may come up in tomorrow's exam, and sort of learnt them in the process. I hope. And I have been blogging. That is about all.  *Looks back at length of post* Wow, I wrote quite a lot this time; saved up all that news for my dear readers. Well, I best get back to geography revision, ta ta.   Reading:  Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone  Listening to:  Combine Harvester - The Wurzles  Watching:  Jurassic Park III tonight. Or maybe video it, it's on rather late. Well, 21:00, but it finishes late, and I have exams tomorrow.  Confused about:  The Aswan High Dam  Annoyed with:  Englih Exams  Mood:  Fairly good, surprisingly.
