O  was very sad............ :,(  years has passed by,  Y  got married to tat rich guy. she has everything tat money can buy but she still, she felt tat there is still something missing in her life....... her husband have many business to look after and he was too busy for her. and one day, her husbands' business failed........losses everything and went bankrup and he left her.  one day, as  Y  was going out to buy something, she was greeted by someone......someone that she never saw for a very long time,  O  .  O  has changed and he invite her back to his house and she agreed.  ......arriving at the doorsteps of his house, a girl opens the door, it was  O  wife and she was pregnant. both of them is a loving husband and wife as what  Y  sees. then, something caught  Y  attention.........her ring, it was wrapped with alluminium foil, like the one she gets on his birthday and she ask her about it.  O  wife laughed and take the ring out and unwrap it, it was a very beautiful diamond ring. "isnt tat silly for him to do tat?" said his wife, then  Y  said "no, it is romantic".........his wife laughed "yeah, he is silly sometimes but it is really romantic". then  O  cuts in........he hug his wife and laugh about it.  Y  finally knew that the thing tat she's missing of in her life is ................ LOVE .  she went back home, and then she find back the give that present tat  O  gave to her on her birthday. she never opens it until now, she opens it..........it was a ring tat  O  has work so hard to buy it.......the beautiful diamond ring that she always wanted..........she cried and regret about it..........   THE END...........    Love can make you happy although often times it hurts.But love is only special if you give it to which it's worth.  Bottomline : If you found someone who truly appreciates you, he/she deserves more of your love.   Two tear drops were floating down the river. One teardrop said to the other, "I'm the teardrop of a girl who loved a man and lost him. Who are you?"... "I'm the teardrop of the man who regret letting a girl go..."  Bottomline : Nobody will sympathise a person who constantly let chances passes by without making any efforts to salvage. We normally don't realise how important our loved and closed ones are until they left us, we'll start reminiscences which results misery.     ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   ps- it may not be the best essay or story tat u have ever heard of but.....it is a really nice one if u truly understands it............hey, i still got few story to tell....................haha........wait ya....
