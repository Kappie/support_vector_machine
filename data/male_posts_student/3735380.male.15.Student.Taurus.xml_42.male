Expect a lot of posts about computers.  As I was saying:  Let's go to the basics. A character is a letter, number, symbol, or a superspecial character. A spacebar is considered a character, a "U" is considered a character, and punctuation and this thingy: §. All of those things you can highlight.  Okay, let's get a little more advanced.

Okay, now the final part is more complicated, since there is no way of testing this and there are no visual explanations here. These symbols do  not  appear on your character map. You can get them through extensive trial and error. You can get superspecial characters like  and  along with . You can find an entire site about this at http://shark.nickj.elixant.com/symbols.html. What you do is you insert them into a HTML editor and watch the sparks fly. My personal favorite is . Have fun with your newfound knowledge!
