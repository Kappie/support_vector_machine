I dunno whether to be excited or downright nervous. I moved from such a small lil Christian private school (which started with only 3 students XD), all the way up to I think the biggest high school in my city. More than 1500 students. @_@ I'm going to dread having to go up to the board to solve a math equation I don't get, especially since I'll be looking like an idiot in front of so  many people. Gaaaaaaaaah. -_-  Let's see...Summerslam is coming from the Air Canada Centre (I think that's the arena) in Toronto, Canada, and is only a couple short weeks away. Yay. I'm looking forward to the Randy Orton - Chris Benoit match for Benoit's World title. I'm pretty sure Orton will come out on top and become the youngest World champion in the titles's illustrious history. :D  Hmm...things are going really, really well with me and Marcelle. We're in love, hehe. And our one month anniversary will be on August 18th. :O :O :O
