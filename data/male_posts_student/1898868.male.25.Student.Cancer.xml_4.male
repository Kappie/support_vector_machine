Only the item(s) are not just perched up there, but are actually glued or velcroed to the roof of the car.  It could either be straightforward, or we could have a really exaggerated response, where people in the streets are going crazy and trying to help them, yelling "Dude, stop the car! You've got a happy meal up there!!" or something.  Or else that could be the treat that went too far, because someone on the sidewalk could take a step towards the car at a stoplight to warn the driver that there's something on the roof, and then that person could be hit by a car and killed or badly injured...
