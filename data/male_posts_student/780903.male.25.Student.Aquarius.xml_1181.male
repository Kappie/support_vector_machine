The directors make many decisions And some of them end in regret Mistakes have been made, the price must be paid But what justice can the shareholders get?  Some say vote them out by proxy Some say just let it go But what most of them do, is decide they will sue But the Delaware court tells them "no!"  Chorus: It's the duty of care It's the business judgment If you act in faith They can't pierce the veil Just because you're dumb And you lost a fortune You're not liable; it's the duty of care  Some of us listened to experts Most of us read the reports And all of us tried; none of us lied And besides, this is contracts, not torts.  On the board of too many adventures We just meet, maybe three times a year For the work day-to-day, there is simply no way We can do more than we have done here  Chorus: It's the duty of care It's the business judgment If you act in faith They can't pierce the veil Just because you're dumb And you lost a fortune You're not liable; it's the duty of care
