You see, dear, the reason that people love to flock to Blog, yes yes, is that they feel they need some sort of "out-let" so that they can 'tell the world their story'...unlike us who indeed love to guzzle tea and shove crumpets down our throats yes yes, quite.  Yeah, understanding the reason for creating, writing and posting for the world my life or 'stories from it', was at first, unclear. I was skpetical of some of the 'ideas' people discussed at first: "My life sucx big ovaries", "Like, omg!, Who wants to touch my nipples?!?"...well, maybe thats a dream site... neways, because of my negativity towards the trustworthiness of man, (especially wo men ), i didnt feel like my works could really make a difference to enough people, that i would be kinda reguarded as some other whinny guy, overwhelmed by excess insecurities or boredom, wishing that some girl would read this and become in love with my apathy for life...(which is not unlike what i used to believe people who posted were) So, i when to my local Psych, and he helped me figure out that by maybe being a mit more positive towards others, and understanding others views instead of just my own, i could become more intouch with what i truly wanted, and not get stagefright ne more....or pee-pee my bed...and also that altho, i may not make a difference in thousands or even hundreds of peoples lives, maybe even just one, atleast i helped that people better understand wsup from the eAsTsIdE oF dA viLLe cAlLeD NASH...T-Rey's version...
