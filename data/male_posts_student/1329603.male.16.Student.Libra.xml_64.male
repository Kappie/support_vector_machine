Oh, the pain, the pain of it all! I'm not too sucky at that dancing game though... hm, apart from the not fancying men bit (which may come in a while, I'm becoming depressingly asexual at the moment) I almost totally qualify for Jonathon's gay club. *needs to stop putting his head on Scott's shoulder and generally being fairly cuddly*  Sam scared me intensely. She didn't once speak to me, she only looked at me a couple of times, and she was fine as a person. But the fact she was there terrified me. I don't know, is that so odd? I can't imagine that being terrified by your ex-girlfriend that cheated on both you and your friend with the same bloke is such an abnormal thing...  I feel very guilty today. I accidentally made Mum buy me; >> A plunger mute; >> A straight mute; >>A small bottle of Slide-O-Mix And it came to almost Â£40. We don't have the money to do things like that, but it wasn't my fault, it really was accidental. Waaaaah. *guilt*  Hm, I want Zoe or Rhiannon... no, not in that way, I just want them here. I miss both of them, they're both so cool and so much of a comfort. *plays with fingers* Rhiannon's leaving at the end of the year, probably. She'll be off to Bangor. Then I won't be able to talk to her very often. Not that I do now but at least if I feel much like it I can wander round with the assumed motive of borrowing something and have like an hour long conversation with her ^^. ...I don't see her very often. And Zoe... the contact I have with Zoe is when we go for walks, and the halloween party, in which I believe I got on with everyone fairly well. Waah.  Saw Miller tonight, too. She didn't actually talk to me at all. I think I shouldn't have posted the last post *guilt*. Sorry, Danni, I didn't mean it like that, I was just upset... sorry. *hugs*  I'm feeling quite ill, and I've got the dress rehearsal for Pirates tomorrow... shit.
