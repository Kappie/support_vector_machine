I just finished the 2nd about five minutes ago ( The Great Hunt ) So far it's a really good series, but long and drawn out. Having ten books in it is more than enough.  I've also learn that at the beginning of each book, after the Prologue, it starts out all the same:  The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was  a  beginning.  Well, I'm off to start reading it. I've just read the prologue and then I decided to write these 2 blog posts. Anyway, I leave you with a list of all the book in order:    The Eye of The World  The Great Hunt  The Dragon Reborn  The Shadow Rising  The Fires of Heaven  Lord of Chaos  A Crown of Swords  The Path of Daggers  Winter's Heart  Crossroads of Twilight
