I'm trying to find something or someone... but i dont know what it or that person is yet. I hope to find what im looking for. I'm replacing stuff that im missing in my life with other stuff. I should try to get out of that habit. But im longing for something or someone... and i dont know what it or that person is yet. But it seems that the more i try, the further away i am to what im trying to find. I think it is because im lost, ill never adjust to this place. Im adjusting to the people and i have no complaints on the girls but it just isn't home. I could never call this place home. The only way i will be able to find this place as a home is if reject my old home. And to do that i need to visit edmonton. If it is as shitty as my worst fears are, well then ill just have to move on. I think ill find what im looking for, and i think i have a hint on who that person might be, and you may be thinking you know who that person is, but i can bet you dont.
