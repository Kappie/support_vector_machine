I was really horny, and Steph, who I used to have the hugest crush on, told me she wanted me. @_@  So yeah...I took the opportunity without thinking of the consequences (as usual) and did it...SOMEHOW Justin knew I had done it and he and Nat started arguing with me over whether it was cheating or not..and at one point Nat said that I was classless and was no good to women. And of course Mike had to say it again. Newsflash: HAVING MIKE SAY ANYTHING TO ME DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. >_>  So I'm just going to have to talk to Colleen and hope she doesn't hate my guts afterwards. >>  Also, I got to see a new picture of Sana. Oh my lord is that girl hot. Just....wow.   Anyways, yea. Summer school starts on Monday, as well. Reallllllly not a good weekend. -_-
