I also took tons of pictures, although only ~40 pictures are on focus ^_^  Edith Emailed me at train station today, but I deleted that email like usual since I don't want to be a spare tire and I really want to get over it.  Tony told me some tricks to get 6-packs today. I am going to try them tomorrow and hopefully it works by the time I am in Toronto  peace out
