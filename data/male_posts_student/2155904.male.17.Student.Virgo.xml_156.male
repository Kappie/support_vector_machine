Yeah, when break is over and WASL schedules come 6 of the 10 days will have the Wednesday late start combined with the Wednesday class length.  All 10 days of school after break are late-start but 4 of the days are the long class periods so that is why there are 6 Wednesdays.  Anyway, today eased by and soon it will be break.  Tyke can't wait.  It's gonna be a good break.  Tyke has been wanting a break but really he is probably more excited about the fact that when he comes back from break school is going to go by pretty quickly.  Except, maybe he shouldn't be expecting it to go so quickly.  Cuz then maybe it won't.  It could even feel long.  And that would suck.  Mighty suck.  So for now Tyke will think happy thoughts about Spring Break.  And his trip to...damn, no trip over break.  Oh well.  There was nothing that was exciting about today.  Absolutely nothing.  Some good hugs.  Some good talks.  Some nice weather.  A little of everything.  And that was all.  So why blog about a day that was fair?  Good question.  Here's your answer:
