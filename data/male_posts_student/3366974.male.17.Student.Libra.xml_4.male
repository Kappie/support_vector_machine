Today, was quite dull. I read a fair bit from Moby Dick, and went uptown a few times. We had spotty showers today, so there wasn't much I could do (outside). I didn't see her (Lauara) cousin today either, could be due to the rain. Or, the simple fact that she doesn't come outside very often. We'll see, she is bound to come out sometime. I don't particulary feel like knocking on her door, especially since I don't know her that well. But, I suppose if I must...  That makes me think, at first I didn't know what to think of her (Laura). But now, I can't help but think about her. Hmm...  It's the fifth day that I took my medication, and things seemed fine today. I even ate before I went to bed and had no trouble sleeping. I go to the doctor's again on Monday, and from whatI understand they are going to increase my dosage.
