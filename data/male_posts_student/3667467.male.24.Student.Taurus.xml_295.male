Anyway, I threw the body in a large campfire but the flames just wouldn't catch, so picked up a rake and started beating the ashes. Well I hit her on the leg and the lady regained consciousness. Then I had to pretend, like, "Oh no, you're on fire! Let me help you!" so I wouldn't look guilty. It was a close one; I almost really embarrassed myself there.
