It was like an act of god cause at that moment they were showing a hour of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. I think that whenever a comedian is hard pressed for material they just go to the  urlLink Christian Broadcasting Network  and just look a little. Anyway they were showing operation iraqi shield or some such nonsense. Basicly stupid people with kids in the service send photos and Pat Roberson and the other 700 club members would pray for a divine shield to protect them. I just sat dumbstruck that people would do such a thing. Pray for your own kids, why have some guy who hosts a bad tv show pray for them.? Then my favorite part come on "Operation Supreme court Freedom(smiting)" I believe was the jist of it. They want to have 3 of the justices they don't like "retiring" in the near future. The new christian colition slogan is if we don't like 'em  Smite 'em.
