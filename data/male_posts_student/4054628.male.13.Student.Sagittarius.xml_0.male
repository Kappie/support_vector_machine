The comments must be relevant to the texts we are studying at the time (for example, The Hobbit) and any inappropriate comments will be deleted before they are displayed.   You will be asked to make at least one entry per week. This entry can be your own opinion, a question for the entire class or me, or a comment on what someone else has written. Remember to phrase your questions or comments carefully asthis blog will be read by the whole class!   If you have any questions as to how to use this blog you can ask outside of class time (come to see me at lunch or before school) or if you feel confident there is a detailed help file attached to this site.   Thank you, and good luck!
