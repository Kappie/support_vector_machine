Well, what happened was I ordered a few books off of Amazon and I got them on Friday.  So I was all excited and everything, and I start reading the main one that I wanted.  Then al of the sudden I finish reading a page and look to the next and see that it isn't the book I've been reading.  In the middle of my book, for 30 pages, it is a completely different book.  So, I went on the site and got everything fixed, and I finally have a correct copy of my book and I just want to read it.  later...
