I'm ordinary.... urgh...  Had a very stressful night last night. Worse than a rollercoaster. Spoke to Zel last night. Well I spoke and she... well.. she was pissed. What's new? We worked things out.. again... and decided to go back to friends... again... and I'll build from there. It's going to take years. Experts tell me that I'm crazy, and that I'm living in a dream land. They just MIGHT be right. The conversation ended better only slightly worse than it began, as when contrasted with a lot worse. I don't know how long this "it's cool and we're ok" thing (geee... sounds familiar?)is going to last. I don't even know if she's playing me, but I chose to see sincerity in her over-enthusiastic appraisal of recent "incidents". I still love this girl. 5 months and 17 days.  I told this guy on the bus off after the show. He had a video cam on the seat beside him and this girl couldn't sit down. He was just a pain. He was slightly stunned, getting told off by someone who's probably more than 5 yrs his junior. I didn't feel good about it, but at least an old lady could have her seat.  Went to the place I was before and walked aimlessly.  Sat on the swing and looked at the stars alone. We were there once, You and I. I wrote your name in the sand and told you that I loved you.   I was too scared to kiss you though I wanted to.
