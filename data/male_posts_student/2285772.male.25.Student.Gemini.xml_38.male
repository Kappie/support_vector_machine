(mark 8:35)   comments    i had a nice argument with my friend saturday night about this very thing. he gave me the same response word for word that you quoted. he also added the popular myth "the prophet said not to worry about consecration and just to focus on tithing and fasting." when asked for a reference, the common reply came "all the prophets have said it." of course, my disbelief in these statements proved that i don't believe in the prophets ;)  one of the big myth's in the church is that in order to live the law of consecration, a large group of individual must live it by some sort of social contract. i think the most practical way to live it was taught by king benjamin. basically, to give to the poor. as an in debt college student, probably the greatest joy i felt this christmas season was buying some books at barnes and noble for underpriviledged children. Comment by: tyler durden at December 30, 2003 08:41 PM    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i agree with gordon. we should be giving all that we had. i am hypocritical though. i could give so much more, but it's hard. why is it so tough? i can't use the excuse that i'm an in-debt college student becuz i still spend much of my money on luxuries and fast food that i just don't need.  ...speaking of fast food....i let myself go over the christmas break. i've eaten like a pig and have only hit the gym a few times. starting new years, i gotta get myself back in gear. i think tomorrow i'll post up some resolutions and see how crappy i live up to them as the year goes by.
