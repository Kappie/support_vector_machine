I like the options, but the text I'm typing in (right now) is showing up larger and is harder to read. I can now bold, italicize, colorize, align, spellcheck, change fonts, and change sizes without having to type in annoying tags.       I made a CD!  Yay for me!  For those of you who care, this is what is one it:      Float On - Modest Mouse    Hit the Floor - Linkin Park    What Are Friends For - Reel Big Fish    Cherry Lips - Garbage    Who Runs This - Angel Demar    Soul to Squeeze - Red Hot Chili Peppers    Get Free - The Vines    Purple Haze - Jimi Hendrix    Everlong - Foo Fighters    Drive - Incubus    Control - Puddle of Mudd    You're so Damn Hot - Ok Go    Throw Away Your Television - Red Hot Chili Peppers    Get What You Need - Jet    I am the Highway - Audioslave    Reptilia - The Strokes    The Way We Get By - Spoon    Aerials - System of a Down    Get Over It - Ok Go    Do You Like It - Our Lady Peace      Had a family dinner tonight. I wasn't in the greatest of moods, so I got annoyed with them quickly and was quite happy when we finally left. We ate at L. Woods, the foods okay. The fries are great though.      I just recently started talking to an old friend again, which is nice. I was actually up until 4 in the morning talking to her, but then I forced myself to go to sleep in fear of my parents. Of course, then what happened was that I was past the point of sleepiness and couldn't fall asleep. I think I finally dozed off at 5:30, but I woke up 10 so the sleep wasn't even really worth it.       Umm...nothing else to say.  Well, there are a few things I   could   say, but these thoughts of mine are not for the general public.  So I'm not posting them.      I think this entry was boring (as usual), so I apologize if you feel that I have just wasted your time. I'll try harder next time. I promise. (Well, not really, but whatever).      - Brian
