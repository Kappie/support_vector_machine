           
      The day went as planned. I got to my classes just fine and I think I will like my english class. Math I could care less about and Art is cool. So anyways, I don't think I am wanted anymore...in any type of shape or form. I don't know what I did or didn't do but I can't control or understand what I have no clue about. I just need to get back to me, I am the only person who cares about me so I think I should actively look out for myself more often. It's really weird how life just points its finger at you on some special day and flips your world upside down or maybe completely squashes it. Well, I will fight back and will not go down easily. Invisible forces will no longer control me.   Oh, also there is another cool motorcycle special on the Discovery Channel tonight. I think I will watch it after I spend sometime with my old friend "The Catcher In The Rye".
