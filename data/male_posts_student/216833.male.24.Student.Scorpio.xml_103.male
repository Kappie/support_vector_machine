Looking for jobs in nor cal, and hunting for a new place to call home.  I really have to much to say to even go into detail. I wish I had the desire to type it all out, but when you miss a few days on this - retracing the meaning shit seems like a waste. I will try and keep a better record so I can look back and remember.  California or Bust....   current mood:  amused current music: jealous sound - anxious arms
