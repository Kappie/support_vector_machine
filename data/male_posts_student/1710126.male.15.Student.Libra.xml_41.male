Without a happy family no matter how much fun you have at the end of the day you will return to troubles and quarrels that will plague you. On the other hand no matter how bitter your day is your family is always there to support you, or at least give you some space to yourself to chill out and reflect. So remember to treasure the happy moments you spent with your family members no matter how insignificant something seems, like eating and chatting around a table, or watching tv together...preserve the bliss in your family!
