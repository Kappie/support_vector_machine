First of all, Im sure there are people out there with different tastes in music......I myself prefer a mix of alternative, rap, and classic rock.  Sorry I'm not an Enya fan.  First of all I would like to make the recommendation that by sigining up at Yahoo Music, you can create your own radio station that plays almost every genre, customized to your own style.  This is free and is VERY useful when I get sick of all the stuff that is played on the radio or on CD's.  But anyways......a few recommendations.....for a pop type of CD I would recommend Hoobastanks new CD, listen to "The Reason" or "Lucky".   I classic rock CD I would recommend would be the Red Hot Chili Peppers greatest Hits or anything by the Beatles(can't really go wrong with the Beatles)  A rap selection...lets see....Kayne West or Twista seem to be two of the most popular at the time but a solid choice would be Jay-Z's Black Album.....Jay-Z's last album.  If you are into the same music of me.....I would recommend anything by 3 Doors Down or the Goo Goo Dolls.....very solid choices in those albums.  Anyways, just thought I would mix up the blog with a little culture.  -Pat
