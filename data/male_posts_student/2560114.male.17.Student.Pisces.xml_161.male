Then i started to get my flow back throughout practice, then we did this backrow hitting drill thing wit seniorz vs. juniorz, we kept on losing and then we switched up the teamz and i ended up setting for my team. It was bitchin cuz i set the ball pretty well and our team won, so i was excited. Then we scrimmaged and stuff, then at the end we did a "hit and go home" drill, and dan was leading it. It was soooo lame cuz i thought i was getting the coach on one, cuz all who was left was me and jon, then jon ended up gettin the coach on one and i was very relieved. Then some of us went to the beach and me and david were basically practicing cuz we're gonna b partnerz this summer. We beat mark and chris, but lost to dan and brian...i guess my beach game is comin back cuz i had a few good hitz, but i really need to work on my serving, and get my jump serve back in gear...U GOT SERVED!!!!...haha, inside joke. Well im gettin ready to go to watch alfred play ova at pepperdine, so ill post stuff later...payce up...a town.
