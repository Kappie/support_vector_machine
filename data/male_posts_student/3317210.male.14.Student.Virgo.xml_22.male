Sure, not all tears are a release, crying from pain is certainly not, but when it comes to emotional situations, a tear is the starting point.     Anyway =P      An Upgrade!    Seems like Blogger has had a GUI update, don't know whether or not I like it yet, but at the moment it's fine. Like the option to edit HTML manually though, very good idea (not that I'm going to use it lol)      Dream on =P    Yep, that's right, they're still going. Latest one was extremely weird, had something to do with France, some very stylistic architecture, old Gothic Cathedral style? It also happened to involve my school, friends from school, a clown, and having a talk to a clown about losing people "I know it's hard, I lost a friend once myself" "But my cow left me!" (the cow was like a spray painted coloured cow... enough said eh?)   Funny dream, very strange lol     Another one involved me having Spiderman powers (but I later found out that the Spidey powers only occurred in my dream's dreams, though I think I did attempt to bring my dream's dream to my dream's reality... Yeah... lol) and strange giant steam engine tanks, and I had to destroy them. So, armed with a rocket launcher, I took a few out, until I tested the alternate attack (right click =P) and that charged up a little bar and took over an enemy vehicle... Yes, it was about as weird as it sounds lol      Homework... EH?    School starts again on Tuesday next week *eek*   I have an assignment to do, in four parts, and I'm going to absolutely hate all of it... Some of it may have been bareable if given in seperate chunks, but who wants to do a new cover for a book, a short story, a character study and a book review all for the same thing?!?!? It's not sane!      Of VSG    Well, I just started with the list, started to get bombarded by their mail list =P   Oh well, heavenly creatures really, I'm sure it's going to get uber-fun very soon...      Of horror stories and power cuts    Well, I was reading a thread at CGTalk entitled "Strangest experiences that happened to you", absolutely freaked me out. These people don't lie (or at least the majority of them) and most of them I would trust with my life (well, almost), and it was really scary stuff. Anyway, page 14 out of 19 and the POWER WENT OUT! It never goes out here! What are the chances! Anyway, I was scared as hell all that night and didn't fall asleep till hours later when the power was back on... lol     Goodnight, it's almost midnight (11:59 as of writing) and I must up and away... Farewell one and all (even though, as I have pointed out many times before, no-one reads this but me lol)
