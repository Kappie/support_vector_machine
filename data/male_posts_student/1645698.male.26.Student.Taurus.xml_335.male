The price for one gram of your cremated material to go to space is:$995.  That's just the rotate-around-the-Earth-until-you-come-crashing-down-upon-some-mexican-city-deal. The also have other ones, like the moon deal. At first I jhought that they were Kazakhtanian [since their first flight is to be from Kazakhtan] and I said okay, that's reasonable. Kazastan was the center of the Soviet Space Program, so it's understandable that they would launch people's remains into space for profit. Then I found out that they were from Texas [Houston], and I said okay that's also some what reasonable. Americans are always trying new things. Now will anyone actually go for this? Yes they probably will and when their ashes come raining down, it'll some how find its way into my eyes for saying this:  "PLEASE DON'T SEND MORE GARBAGE INTO SPACE!"
