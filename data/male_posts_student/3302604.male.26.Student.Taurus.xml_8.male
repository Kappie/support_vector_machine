Isn't it such a relief that the Americans have mysteriously discovered that they want to talk to him about some crime that he apparently commited some time ago. Its almost as though a favour was asked of George Bush. Surely not.  Unfortunately, there's one or two minor problems. Basically, the British couldn't have him arrested as he hasn't actually done anything against the law in this country. Except for saying nasty things about people but, in spite of teh efforts of Daivid Blunkett, that's still not illegal. So we need the Americans to take him off our hands. Fine. Trouble is, though, that if he is to face the death penalty when he faces the crimes for which he is being extradited, British law says that he cannot go. Problems, since he faces one charge of kidnapping. Ho hum.  It looks like they'll have to do a quick rethink, but I'm sure its no problem for men of this calibre, since they managed to put together such a convincing argument for invading any country they feel like.  I wait with baited breath  Jack
