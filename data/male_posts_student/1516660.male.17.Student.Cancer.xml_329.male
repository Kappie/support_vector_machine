Anopter weird dream. In that dream, I received a very loud message. It was very clear, deepa dn set. It seems like I have been told the truth. I could have been wrong, but this message is much more clearer than the dream itself. I even found myself muttering it.... Then I woke up la. Even ducks meowed.  Okay. I bathed then went downstairs to buy 8 Days. I was supposed to go 883 with Mother today, because I woke up late, my Mother went herself. Meow! Even 8 Days are meowing and mooing at the cats and ducks of the Meowing Land. I ate chee cheong fun, then went online somemore. I also went down (again) to buy a bowl noodle for myself. Long time never eat that le.   Hmm. Amanda came online, followed by WQ. Amanda's so sweet and touching. Thanks so much for caring! Lova ya too! Wendy too, you are a dear. No no people. Don't get mistaken. They are my very very dear close friends. Meow! :P Okie. Meow mooo. I ate my lunch, and stayed online till 2+. I prepared to go play badminton.  Ayioh!! How meowful!! CQ called me and tell me that the rest are gonna be meowingly late! Meow moo! I was there waiting for ducks and cats to come. I called WQ, buit he ain't coming. Soon, CQ came at 3.20+. How meowful!  We booked the court first. Hmm. At 3.45, we started playing lor. Play play play. The rest (Joyce, HL and Gloira) joined us later. We meowed more. HL's hand turned black from using my racket and I developed a blister on my middle finger. Ergh! We then sat down and meowed. I told Ji about my dream about me and him. I find Gloria very chao. No offense to her, but she interrupts my account with her own comments, which I don't find very nice. As a Wiccan, I was offended being called a "demon"! Destroyed the momentum! We talked some more, and at 6, we went home.   Hmm. We walked towards Marsiling MRT, where we met WQ's mother. We exchanged a few greetings and went on our way. Hmm. I took the train and alighted at Woodlands. I have no mood to walk back home. So tired and hungry! Meow moo!  I reached home, bathed, ate and came online meowingly. Hmmm. Meow meow!   Okay. I think I end le. Sorry for rushing so much, but AI is showing. I wanna root for Matthew Metzger and Katie Webber! Even ducks are meowing!! Meow meow moo!
