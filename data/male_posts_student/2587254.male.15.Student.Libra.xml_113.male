This really isn't my happy day......I mean I was so happy shifting to 10 hours of sleep today...and tomorrow I'm waking up at 630 once again for senior band. *Sniff Sniff, Shakes fist.* YUP....great way for the week to greet me:  "Hey Joe! Haven't seen you in a while for school.....I'M GONNA START WITH SENIOR BAND! MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA SUFFER! FOOL!"  That's my rendition of it at least....if not everyone's. Good to know at least I didn't spend my last day of the week in agony hermitting in front of my compy. So I avoided one thing lol...and got other things done =P.  My day's schedule got pushed back a bit today as instead of waking up at target time of 9am....I decided to relax and sleep until 1130 lol. Wasn't all bad.....I got more sleep......a very precious commodity during high school and university ^_^. So headed downstairs....ate....and then a phone call barrage/chaos erupted...  Yeah....today I had to go to Gavin's for planning for praise. Took us a LONG time *Not gonna go into gruesome details* to FINALLY get everything set up and done and over with. Don't know if final outcome was for the best....but I think so since also we got some hefty ground covered for praise night. So after the loooooong delay......we FINALLY got into the car and off to Gavin's.....making a stop @ Carmen's to pick her up...and FINALLY we arrive at Gavin's 30 minutes later. Lucky this ain't Toronto.....couldn't imagine what life would be like if it were like that lol. Wait....SUBWAY! =P.  So finally made it to Gavin's *trying to make this blog speedy gotta get sleep* and started planning. A few accomplishments made today:  -Got 22 songs brainstormed for Saturday -10 or so themes to think about -Scripture for those themes -I CAN SWITCH FROM C TO G TO E MINOR CHORD ON THE GUITAR SMOOTHLY!  OOOOOOH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT! MY CHORD EXPANSION IS AT ABOUT 8 NOW AND I CAN SHIFT BETWEEN THREE OF THEM WITH GRACE AND SMOOTHNESS! And of course the other things too lol. So got all that stuff covered.......ate some food *courteously provided by Gavin's parents hehe* and fiddled around with compy for a bit...then off to Wendy's for dinner and just some good times.  Dave and Tommy were there also....which I forgot to get 15 bucks from Dave. What else? Hmm........just lots of jokes and stuff......eating of course......PS2......chattin' and an unfinished game of Chinese Checkers.  Anyways....I'm off to sleep.....after this weekend one must adjust back to crummy school time. 6 hours of sleep *shudder.*  Cya.
