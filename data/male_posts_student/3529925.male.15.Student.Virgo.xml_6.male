Unfortunately, my utter pointless devotion got the best of me, and here I am. SCHOOL IS FREAKING OVER. It makes me all fuzzy in the inside. I can hardly believe it. Next year is going to rock.. not to mention this summer. I hope to get a job in which I could be making about 120 dollars a week. That's pretty sweet for my standards. I have no car to buy, no school to pay for... all I need is a new computer. And a new DDR pad. So, with hope, this summer will kick ass. Although, I do feel the need to reflect on the last days of school. Specifically finals: as always, they sucked. My geometry final was easy, and my Chem final was impressively difficult. Rather unsurprisingly and atypical of me, I studied for neither of them (shh... don't tell my mommmy). School just sucked this year. I sucked at APH, pulling THE LOWEST GRADE in the ENTIRE class. Actually, if you count the other section, the entire 2 classes. That really saddens me, but it also forces me to come to terms with a fact that I have been realizing over the past year. I - Kevin Davis - have entered the ranks of the ignorant. That's simply all. I formly pretended to be smart, but I understand that it's time to call off all of that nonsense and face the facts. I'm no longer smart. Good show, me. Close, but no cigar.
