I’m not that tall, but I guess I have exceptionally long legs, because they don’t fit quite comfortably behind economy class seats. I was seated next to an overweight Australian couple. They were in position when I arrived and I tried to open with pleasantries, unappealing though this pair was, but they studiously ignored my presence. I had assumed that the male’s enormousness has led them to request this seating as I had done, but it seems either that that is not the case, or that they really disliked my presence, because they fucked off as soon as they were able to sit elsewhere in the somewhat deserted plane.  Now of course, that pisses me off, having paid A$2129 for my six-stage return flight. I hate feeling like a sucker, and I hate the nagging feeling that I could’ve gotten a better deal on my flights. I’d really prefer it if airlines just charged fixed fees, like suburban railways: when you’re on a train and your deserted, you possibly feel like the railway is overcharging, but not like you’re a sucker.  On the other hand, now that those Aussie fuckwits have pissed off, I have an entire row of three seats entirely to myself: I’m sitting in the middle seat, with the seat to my left for my bag, and the seat to my right for reading matter, pillows and detritus.  One thing that was comforting about those Aussies though was that the man was wearing generic blue cotton tracky daks just like me—I couldn’t imagine that anyone else would be gauche enough to go to Vietnam dressed like they were lounging round the house, which in his case is probably in Newcastle, given his huge size, tats, and his turning down the offer of VB from a steward (i.e. he drinks enough beer to think himself above VB—but when offered Tiger beer instead he’d patently never heard of it, an reacted as if quite impressed). He was wearing a Namibia baseball cap too, which probably means he’s a rugby union man, but beyond that for me the semiotics are unclear.  The cabin crew’s English is a bit poor. Well, whatever, but this flight is, to my moderate surprise, mostly Westerners. Moreover, they seem baffled by my self-confessedly rather good English. My first resort, from habit, when met with incomprehension, was to speak with a distinct Australian accent. This didn’t work so I switched to RP, from where I retreated to hand gestures. Asked whether I wanted beef or fish, my answer, beef, was interpreted to mean fish, This is poor, rather like the fish.
