Spent most of my time so far doing my own laundry and cleaning the common areas of the house. Not that I'm a neat freak or anything, I just believe in being tidy and organized (which is ironic since my room is a mess, which is okay with me since it's, hopefully, not a common area in the house).  Finally talked with Karen my gf. We both miss each other and that's good. I haven't spoken with her for almost 2-months and have text'ed each other a few times during my absence. Anyways, she mentioned that she was going to apply to the CDC (no not the Clark Development Committee for those Kampampangas but the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia... Or HOT-lanta depending if y'alls is from da dirty south... which I agree sometimes with that it's all about chicken and beer... sarup!).  Anyways, if she gets the position, it's another 2-years apart from each other (3 total). LOL! Oh man. I sure know how to pick relationships. Anyways, I brought up that maybe we should seprate since I don't really mind long distance relationships but it seems our paths are going in different directions... Her's to the east coast and mine to the Pacific.  I'm not the kind of person that would be selfish and tell her for my sake not to follow her dreams, it's important that she does this because this is what she wants to do. I've always supported her and her goals, so hoepfully she'll support mine and my interests of returning to the Philippines and helping the people and country there... (I'm considering pursuing my doctoral program there...)  Ah well... I told her we'd talk more about it later... I hate breaking up, it's not fun... :P
