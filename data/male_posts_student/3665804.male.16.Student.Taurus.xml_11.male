So for the first time I sat down with the Elder Scrolls III construction set and actually figured out how to work plug ins enough to make it longer, a lot longer. I haven't finished yet, and I don't know exactly what I'll do but I think I got the basics figured out and I'll finish it in a matter of days. If anyone is interested in getting the plug, teach me how to email them. I am incompetent.
