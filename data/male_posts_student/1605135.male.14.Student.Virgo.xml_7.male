I got two A's this semester, so I'm fine for my semester grade unless I get lower than a C, wich isn't happenning.  My chemistry teacher, Mr. Pham, has been out with chicken pox (he never had it before since he lived in Vietnam as a kid) for the past few days.  He somehow recovered in under a week and was back for our exam today.  The exam was a lot easier than I expected, 115 multiple choice questions in two hours.  He was nice for a change and gave us ten free extra credit points for writing about our opinions on the class.  That means I could get a 94/115 on the actual exam and still get an A with the extra credit!  I may actually get a B or A in chemistry now.  Excellent.  I tried out this new AudioBlogger thing a few minutes ago.  It seemed pretty cool, but it didn't actually record anything in my post.  Strange...  I doubt I'd use it even if it did work though, the long-distance fees must really pile on.  Tomorrow I have two exams, Spanish and pracalculus.  I went double-A in Spanish, so I'm not worried about that.  In precal I went B-A the two quarters, which means I have to get an A if I want an A for the semester.  Hopefully I'll do well on that.  EDIT: Right after I made this post I noticed that the AudioBlogger thing didn't play anything because I didn't have my speakers on.  I am a dumbass.
