I tend to agree with the first one more than I do the other one, although the second one has some valid points in there.    --------------------------------   You are a SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a Evil Genius.    You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.    Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world.     You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.    You are not to be messed with. You may explode.    Of the 1096 people who have taken this quiz since tracking began (8/17/2004), 15.5 % are this type.     --------------------------------  You are a SRDL--Sober Rational Destructive Leader. This makes you a Mob Boss.    You are the ultimate alpha person and even your friends give you your space. You can't stand whiners, weaklings, schlemiels or schlemozzles. You don't make many jokes, but when you do, others laugh out loud. They must.    People often turn to you for advice, and wisely. You are calm in a crisis, cautious in a tempest, and attuned to even the finest details. Yours is the profile of a smart head for business and a dangerous enemy.You have a natural knack for fashion and occupy a suit like a matinee idol  .     Your charisma is striking and without artifice. You are generous, thoughtful, and appreciate   life's finer things.    Please don't kick my ass.    Of the 1093 people who have taken this quiz since tracking began (8/17/2004), 4.6 % are this type.
