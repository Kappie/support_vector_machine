Mel Brooks is a GENIUS! Then I watched Angus.  Its about a fat kid who tries to survive teen years.  It was pretty good I guess.  Kind of boring and predictable... but hey it beats the sox off school.  So what else is up for me today? Hmm not sure. Probly have to clean my room and then I'll probly try and make a bunch of Duck Tape Stuff cause I am really far behind I have less than a week... o well I'll get it done. I'll just not sleep for a while.  Does anyone know when Napoleon Dynamite will be in theators here in good old State College? That looks like an awesome movie.  Well ok I'll try and find some pictures for you-all or maybe I'll do something fun then I accually have something interesting to write about...  Until Then.  -Dan V
