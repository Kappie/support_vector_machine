When I need a friend to talk to because I feel like I've lost touch with reality, I can always go to her. She tells it like it is. Nothing more, nothing less. You all should talk to her.. her IM is "kateisi" without the quotes. She also is excellent at writing poems. You should all read this poem she wrote:  once there was a girl who took a walk at night she wandered along the roadside alone and out of site  as she walked along that road a car came speeding near the headlights bounced from side to side and her heart filled up with fear  before she thought another thing she was laying on the ground she saw that blood was streaming out and she screamed without a sound  as she looked one last time a face stared in her eye "we're going to help you" he said but she just said goodbye  then the darkness came again followed by a light a driver full of alcohol  stole her life that night  now its time that walks along the road and the driver is in jail but it doesn't put away the pain of such tremendous scale     another young life was lost that night and a family's torn apart memories are all that's left an end came from a start.  Good, eh!!? Better than anything I've written.  Tomorrow I shall bring you another profile of a good soul. ta ta for now
