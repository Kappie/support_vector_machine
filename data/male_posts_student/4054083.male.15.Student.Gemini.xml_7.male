It kinda solidified in my mind that she doesn't wanna see me/meet up with me or whateevr, for her own reasons. That sucks, since like she says, she wont ever be coming back to Cornwall, but even though it doesnt seem fair that all our friendship has been for almost nothing, it's the way the shit rolls.
