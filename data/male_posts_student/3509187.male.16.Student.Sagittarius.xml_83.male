Thursday I'm probly seeing Dodgeball (Finally)...  and Friday I've got a party... Sadly, I'll be leaving for a week on Sunday... Leaving for Wilderness... I'll be back late the 31st... Just in time for the Gig... Whoo... I'm excited, this is like a real Gig... I'm seeing Donnie Darko, Napoleon Dynamite, and the Village either that first week of August or soon after... Let me know if you want to join... I'll be gone Aug 5 and 6 for rafting in Ohio, Aug 10 for Warped Tour, Aug 11-13 for CeederPoint, and Aug 17 to 27 for Arizona... WHOOO... I love that state...
