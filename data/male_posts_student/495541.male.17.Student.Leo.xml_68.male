We had a 80-yard drive down the field the first possession and ended up fumbling it and letting a 95-yard touchdown return go.  And to add to that a two-point converstion.  The game stayed tight until half-time.  Wash, still up by 8.  During half-time, we really got back into it and we came out an just plainly kicked ass.  I'd explain the rest of the game, but I just don't feel like it.  I will say though we had many guys step up and work their asses off.  I was disappointed I didn't play, to say the least.  (I do not count the 3 plays where we ran the clock down)  Nothing much more for me to say.  Good night.
