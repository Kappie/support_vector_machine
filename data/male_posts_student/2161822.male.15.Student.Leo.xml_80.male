I think it's because all of the clear solutions were water. Once again, our chemistry teacher blesses us with his godlike knowledge. And of course it had to snow. I thought we might be done with bad weather and I'd finally be able to go outside for a change, but no. Mother nature screws me over again. At least there was no driver's theory tonight. That's the most boring waste of time ever. We learn about the different shapes of traffic signs and watch oscar winning movies. (Just take the one,  Please God, I'm only 17!  for example. Now come on. The title of this one has greatness all over it) I really hope it gets nice out soon. Going outside at least keeps me occupied. And keeps me from playing  games like this.  This one has to top the list for stupidest games ever. Check it out and I think you'll agree.  Listen to H.I.M.
