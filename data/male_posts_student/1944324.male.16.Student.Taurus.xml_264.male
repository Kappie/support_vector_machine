The guy has no prose skillz. can't act.  Plus, or minus, as the case may be, hes a bloody hypocrite, he's rude, and has to have the stage constantly.  He'll cut people off on questions and go on scripted tangents.  I think he decides exactly what he's going to say before hand and if you don't follow his script hes just going to block you out.   Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
