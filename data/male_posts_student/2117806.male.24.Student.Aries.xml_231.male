That essentially means that, if you are so inclined, you can leave a smartass remark about something I've posted here by clicking the appropriate button below each post.  I set it up so anyone can comment, not just registered users, so feel free to leave your thoughts, comments, and random asides.  And stuff.  Yeah.  And for the record--Adam Askins is a huge freakin' slacker.
