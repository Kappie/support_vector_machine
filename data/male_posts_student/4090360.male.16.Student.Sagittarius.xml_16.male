On another subject, I would like to recommend a cd that I am really enjoying right now. It is called  urlLink Masterpiece by David Moore . David Moore is Gateway Youth's worship leader and he plays acoustic guitar/vocals at  urlLink Gateway Church . This cd is great. I have listened to it, at least, 10 times through. Believe me when I say there is not one bad/unenjoyable (aka Filler) song on the entire cd. If you would like a copy just click on the Masterpiece by David Moore link. I would also like to recommend a show that is only accesible through the internet. Unofficially entitled "The Tim Show," is revealing itself to be one of the best pre-shows on the internet. Hosted by the very qualified talent of  urlLink Tim Fox  (only rivaled by  urlLink Barbara Walters ). This is show is a must-see for all who like quality enternainment with a christian atmosphere. You can see the "Tim Show" everyday this week (8/2-8/6) at 8:45am or 6:45pm on  urlLink this website .  -running boldy
