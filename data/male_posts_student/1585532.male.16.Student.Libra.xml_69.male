Everythign was overpriced and very sub-par.  Recently, Fry's started selling DDR stuff, including DDR pads.  For all you DDR freaks out there...  Turns out they have a similar metal arcade pad. I tried this thing out, and found out it sucked  royally .  I tried playing Tsugaru, and the back arrow, along with the up arrow barely responded. The left and right arrows were warped, and the arcade bar fell off while I was playing. Oh, I also failed. (Its a sad day in DDR when you pass "Dream A Dream" and it says "Its a new record" when you have a D...)  Anyways, tried playing Twilight Zone RC Extended Club Remix on heavy. The gallop/16th steps make the first 40 or so seconds pretty irregular. When dealing with this, people usually tend to have a "hard rhythm" going. (You're stepping out a more forceful beat...) Some dude says I better quit "stomping" on the pad. (Oh I'm sorry, would you like me to play with my hands?) I told him that nobody would have to stomp if the pad didn't suck so much. Anyways,  DO NOT  buy this pad. Its a waste of $300. A family that was looking into a new DDR pad took notice at how disgusted I was with the pad and didn't buy it. In your face Fry's. Damn jerks.  Moral-Don't sell stuff that sucks ass.  Because I'm going to come and make sure that people don't get ripped off you bastards.
