There were at least a dozen of them from Minneapolis, Buffalo, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. The sad thing is that all these papers pretend to be unique in their own cities when they're really just the same as the rest of them. They all hate George W. Bush, they all think Super Size Me is a great Michael Moore-ian view of corporate propaganda and the American obesity epidemic, they all have a column by Dan Savage, and they all have the same pictures of the same women in their classified ads. Even the papers written in French are like this. (I think.) So while I'm waiting for two of these editors to disagree with one another, color me disappointed. The only thing I learned about local politics was that they're bad and getting worse, and I didn't have to leave my house to know that. Also, out of all these papers, Buffalo's Artvoice was by far the crappiest.
