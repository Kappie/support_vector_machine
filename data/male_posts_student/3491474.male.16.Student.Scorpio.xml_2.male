Without starting a 10 page rant, let's just say it wasnt very difficult... then again it was math 514 so i guess its okay. We got the yearbook and, as per usual with 12th graders it was a frenzy to get people to sign your yearbook (i only asked one person to sign),so that in 10 years, when your flippin burgers at "fatso's sloppy fries," you can remember you were popular and enjoyed teasing people like me who are now your boss, at least for the 2 and a half minutes when i'm waiting for you and your lazy ass to get me that bigmac.  Anyway, it's time for me to take a well deserved rest (dont know what i really did this year at school but im tired anyway), and then, in 2 months, we get to go to adults school for a year and finish  IMPORTANT  courses, to allow me to moove on in life as i forsee.  Ill probably post a few times this summer when i'll be bored shitless, and i'm promising myself that next year im gonna excell in whatever endeavours i take on.
