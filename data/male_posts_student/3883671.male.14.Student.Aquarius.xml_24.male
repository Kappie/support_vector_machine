My sister is sick though. NOT BAD. Sust stomach sickness. :( I think she may be better today though.  We haven't had any farm help for about 4 days now but mom put an ad in the newspapper and we have recieved so many calls. we have a man now that should have the job. and He should do a good job at it. ;) He has a girlfriend and a 2 year old son.   Well that's all to tell. Have a good time with, well..., Whatever.  Good Night.
