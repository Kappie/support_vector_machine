Miller emailed me about my remark about blondes. I don't mean it in that way. But you know, those people who look really plastic, you know... people like Vicky who are normal blonde but don't go round in an inch of makeup are cool. I suppose I didn't clarify it, so here I go; as long as you're not totally obsessed with how you look, you're fine. Even if you are and have a sense of humour you're OK.  Anyway... Gwen's poking me in the forehead. The tit. Go away. Right, that did it.  Thanks Miller, you're in my head now. Gr.  Cerrie or however it's spelt had a slapping contest with my arm. My arm lost on account of it not having a hand to hit back with. My arm is going to be so red in the morning, she's fairly vicious.  Anyway, I'm going to stop after today's poetic quote;  "I heard a thousand blended notes, While in a grove I sat reclined, In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind."  From Wordsworth's   Lines   Love, Jon Roskilly
