Ok, so today as mother drives driving to school, I think, hey wait, do I have my wallet? So while I search my pockets with the other. No wallet.  My stepmother looking all over neglecting the road.  Hm... luckily I had no dire need for it, and I am already going to be late for class. Then, when I get to school, I grab my school bag, gym bag, and lunch of the back seat, and head off towards the school, and as I head to English class, I notice I feel somewhat... lighter than usual. Something was missing... I check my pockets (again) and not only was I missing my wallet, but my keys also. Yes, I locked my keys in the my mother's car. When I checked after classes, there they were, on the passenger seat, seeming to mock me, and my absent mindedness. So with no wallet, and no keys, I spent most of my day thus far trying to figure out how But anyway, after a few tense hours, and a lot of frustration, and feeling rather dumb, everything worked out ok. Nothing injured except my pride.  If I had an office the sign on the door would say 'my door is always open unless it's closed'. I'm in the mood to watch a video called 'rare trampoline accidents' that would amuse me right now. Everywhere there is sperm but we can not see it. It would be good if somehow we were able to see all the sperm and feces that is everywhere. On the subway pole the dying sperms from some man who had just tossed off in the peep show. And you're standing by the pole with one hand on it while you eat a bag of chips. Once while I was in the hallway I looked down and on the cuff of my pants there was what looked like a giant wad of jizz. It kind of freaked me out. What if some man was standing near me while waiting for the subway and was tossing off under his jacket. Or maybe it was just snot.    So I have some conclusions:  Everytime a dog licks his paw a kid in Nebraska starts barking. Make me believe in skepticism. Lie down vertically is fun. Stand down in the night not the day. Give advice about advice. On which day did god create days, the last thing he said was 'don’t touch that' There are revolving doors of misperception.   And I really love this dating thing, I mean Edwin is sweet as to boot and sexy as hell and he really does know what he wants. I truly believe that we are great together, and I have two full days with him.    For a long time, feminists have been reputed to hate sex. What does their sexuality have to do with it? Is there any validity, or was there ever any validity, in the assertion that feminists are opposed to pleasure or the human form? I ask this because of the infighting and mixed up ideals emerging from the mouths of self-proclaimed feminists. It is confusing to read a denouncement of Hooters or Playboy as being sexist enterprises when I, a feminist, do not find myself agreeing with that statement. Do you frequent strip clubs? Spill it ... how does your feminism influence or limit your sexuality?  I am going to be fairly unoriginal, and comment on Valentine's Day, since the day of love is almost upon us. I have mixed feelings on the subject for a few reasons. For most of my life, I was single on Valentine's Day. Actually, four years was the first time I was with someone on Valentine's Day and only that one time. So, I generally had feelings of resentment towards it. However, this being my first Valentine's Day with  urlLink Edwin , I have had a change of heart (no pun intended). While I do agree that every day is a good day to say "I love you" to that special someone (and I do make sure to repeatedly let my special someone know I love him) but it is kinda nice to have a special day, to go over and above, and make a big deal of these things. But at the same time, since I spent so many Feb. 14ths single, I have sympathy for my single friends out there. I hate being a sort of "dating elitist." But I seem to do so from time to time. I don't think singleness is a bad thing. In fact, I enjoyed mine, but there comes a time, when most people come to a point where they want to share something special another. But should we couples be encouraged to flaunt our romance around others who may be lonely, and wanting to find someone? This is quite the sticky situation. Do we risk offending others or do we risk offending our significant other (and all us know how our boifriends/girlfriends will never let us forget neglecting our valentine's duties)?  But, not for I, I think that my boi  urlLink Edwin , whom is amazing can get me nothing and the shear joy of seeing him on Saturday is enough for me. Seems like some stuck between a rock and a hard place. The second problem is with the obvious commercialism of Valentine's Day. With the cost of flowers, cards, candy, gifts, etc. that we are "told" we should buy, the middle of Feb. can be an financially bleak time, especially for us students, who are still recovering from tuition payments and textbooks from January. Is it wrong to give in to the capitalist seduction of Hallmark? Should we boycott this money-grubbing, and greedy facet of our society, and eliminate Valentine's Day for the sake of our wallets? Part of me says "YES, YES!" But part of me says "shower him with gifts." I mean, he deserves it, so I suspend my objections to our consumerist society for a day? Does this make me a hypocrite? Ohhh, so many questions! My solution has been thus far a middle-ground. Do something simple. A little gift, spend time together, and stay away from Hallmark stores, with those adorable little bears, balloons, cards, etc. that whisper, "buy me! He'll love me. It will make him happier." and so on.  Buy away for even if I shan’t be showered it doesn’t matter.   I would rather the time and the message and the relationship flourish and bloom, even if the flowers are in the store wilting.
