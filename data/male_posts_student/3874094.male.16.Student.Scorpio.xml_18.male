Graduates had planned to hold a mini harmonica training camp on friday, well from what i heard it was just meant for us grads as well, we still suck quite badly at the three slavonic dances thing..so yea, guys decided that we could do with the extra practice, and set the time to meet at five p.m in school.  Being a friday, ah well, had another piano accompaniment class...did aural this time...i sincerly swear that she was trying her darnest not to laugh when i sang all out of tune..oh well.  Rushed down to school...only to find that not a single soul was in sight...found out that those clowns were watching the house of flying daggers at jurong point...crap...wanted to catch that movie too..."Amused" myself by practising those damn violin scales over and over again....exam pieces over and over again till Ls reached yuhua at around uh...5.50? Got himself plugged into CM while i continued yada yada yada.....  When we finally got into the harmonica room at around 8pm? Placed orders for a Mcdonald's delivery...yeap. Then it was practice practice practice till about 11.45pm, then we had to see allan off...and at the same time i agreed to help mdm peng's friend to edit the length of a particular song..well, when you have a friend like Jesper in the School Of Audio Engineering, should be an easy task for him yea?  Nothing really much interesting happened later...had noodles...Ls got everyone amused by yelping in fright at his sleeping position's close proximity to a er well, dead roach corpse. Plugged myself into my discman and into the world of 98.7fm at around 3am as i tried to catch some shuteye....proved to be one helluva choice as i later found out that those clowns i.e yewon and george were causing quite some noise outside the harmonica room at around 4 plus am...disrupting most of the people's sleep..me excluded of course mawhahahahaha.  Heard that they started calling people at about 6 plus am to wake them up for harmonica...goodness, really pitied those victims...jingying, shehui, zu er...just to name a few  victimised people ....all just too some people's boredom...though it DOES sound like fun though...in a twisted way.... *smiles sardonically*   Yeap onto Saturday....shehui seemed ok...heard that she actually wept for Jay Chou when she recieved news that his vocal chords were damaged or something like that...hey girl, its not the end of the world yea? Besides people like jay, there are other people that exist in this world...good example would be adorable little ole moi....LOL ok people i didnt mean to make u guys throw up...just a harmless ego joke...mwahahahaha. Yea well it was just more and more practice...skipped lunch to go do the violin again...uh and then after their lunchbreak it was more practice again until i had to leave for violin class. And OH yes, i SWEAR that Jingning  Co. DELIBERATELY arranged for me to sit next to sylvia...hell, hopefully tongues will stay silent...though its great to be sitting next to yeongsheng again, reminds me of the good old times when we struggled together in first high....ah.... *dabs lightly at eyes *  LOL. Okay i think that the fatigue is making me slightly delirious, and the fact that Ja Rule is rappin away in the background doesnt seem to be helpin in anyway....*yAwn*  Er, so after all that, jesper and allan came over to my house...jesper doing the song editing for me, while allan erm...was just to accompany us and to entertain shehui on msn using a mic...hahaha.  Jesper edited the song very nicely...though gave up while trying to do a second version...and we all just went out to makan at je. Had a crappy plate of hokkien mee, had to order another bowl of noodles, mee pok i think, to appease the very dissatisfied stomach.  So yeap, thats that then....really nothing else to write...woot there we go, done with releasing all my crap..*yAwn* crap i really need to get some shuteye, jesper still wants me to go to his house in the morning...heh we shall see about that....so yea, later people.
