Of course, Mr. Schwarzenegger is referring to the Dana Carvey, and Kevin Nealon sketch from Saturday Night Live, and in his own little way making fun of himself.  What followed was yet another polarizing effect which seems all to commonplace in politics.  On one hand Schwarzenegger’s 67% approval rating (the highest for any California governor, in recent history, including Ronald Regan) shot way up.  On the other hand many complained that he was playing up homosexual, and feminine stereotypes, and therefore should apologize.  There is something very rare in Schwarzenegger, something that many of his Republican counterparts do not have, and that is a good sense of humor.  Schwarzenegger has been able to be socially moderate, while still representing a fiscally conservative stance that has been the core of traditional Republican policy.  I love him for everything I hate about our current selection of Republican candidates.  And at the risk of starting controversy, I would say that Schwarzenegger’s incredible charisma, no-nonsense attitude and decidedly outsider label reminds me of another man who said all the right things, and all the wrong things at the same time: Bill Clinton.  People like Schwarzenegger and Bill Clinton show us that when a candidate comes into the established political atmosphere and does not roll over right away they will be popular with the people and despised by their adversaries… and their adversaries are Girlie Men.
