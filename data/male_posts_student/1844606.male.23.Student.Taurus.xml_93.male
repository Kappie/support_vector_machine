And I have no "ideas" and by that I mean stories that are fictional. Could just tell personal stuff.  Don't necesarily feel like it.  Want to write about love, but don't remember what its like.  Would severly be lackin in the "details" and "character development" sections.  Friends are getting job interviews.  Meth, I hear you callin' me...err rather Reality I hear you calling me.  Seems like my roommate is hatching a plan (probably won't go through) to continue to live off of others.  I don't plan on being a part of it.  I'm thinking about calling a girl, her birthday is a few days away and I haven't talked to her since August.  Had a dream about her a few days ago.  She was in a white/silvery dress and crying.  I was consouling her.  Even my dreams are real.
