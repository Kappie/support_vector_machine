After that about 9 or so I went to Shoneys for breakfast with my mom. Dad was supposed to join us, long story. Then we went to Barnes  Noble and I got some very good chocolate frozen type of coffee yeah, whatever its called. Then we went to Wal Mart and of course I had to see someone I knew cause I had that chocolate stuff all in my teeth. I ran into Danielle and her bf Ben. Luckily she didnt notice, dk about Ben though. Great seeing them. Then I came home and helped mom with the grass. Now I'm on here. Have a great evening. Love, Carson
