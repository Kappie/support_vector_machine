My inherent interest lies in science fiction. So, the decision is made to write a Sci-Fi novel. My roommate listens to the plot and thinks it should be based more on scientific theories than on fictitious and wonderous ideas that I have. No wonder he is going to be a good scientist, he likes publishing in scientific journals. I am writing an entertaining novel, and not proving any theories. The idea of basing the wonders of my novel-world to scientific theories sounds preposterous and is rejected.  So, blabberings aside, 'What's the plot?' - you might ask ... so I will start outlining the plot in my subsequent posts. Here are the few things that I need to do before I can start working on the actual plot.  Character bibles Location description -->I have positionsfor artists to give life to all of these - any takers? Some study of neurology (for some basis to the scientific wonders)  thats all for now, keep visiting for more updates.  -Arnav
