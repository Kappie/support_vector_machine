It is not a freackin' ketchup company! It's an M not an N! Ahhhhhhhhhh! Sorry. Next, the last name "Patton" was located after the name "Wise". A violinist goes to Assumption. So the assume he goes to school? One person was home schooled, and and the program said he goes to Woodrow Wilson Jr. High. The last one I'm going to mention is that Indian Hills Junior High School was located at Clive and West des Moines. I incredibly hate the program and the reason I cannot mention any more is that I burned the program and those are the only ones I remember.
