Do I have someone that I'm really close to? Do I have a regular interest that occupies my time? I can say no to all these answers. Maybe my sister is right. My defintion is me. I spend all the time worrying about myself and how people will look at me. I cannot enjoy anything, cause I'm always worrying about myself. I love to plan. I plan what I'm going to do tomorrow, next week, next month of even far into the future. And what do I do tomorrow? I plan for the day after tomorrow! How exciting! (sarcastically)  I do not know how to describe my day. I've been feeling odd lately. I've been thinking much more and it's always nothing good. And I get this chill running down from my chest to my stomach, just exactly what I'm going thru now and throughout the day too. Argh...  Words to describe my day: Odd, sad, tearful, happy, useless, reflective, misfit, destructive, lame, futuristic, uncomfortable, rainy, boring, sleepy.
