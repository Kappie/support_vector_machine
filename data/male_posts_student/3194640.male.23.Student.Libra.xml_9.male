Early buzz from  urlLink Fox News  says that Roland Emmerick's ( Independence Day ,  Godzilla ) new disaster flick is just that:  urlLink a disaster . If my assumptions are correct, this film will be just as good as  Volcano . If it's anything like   Volcano , the dialogue should go something like this:    Scientist:  New York is being flooded with water!  Disaster "Expert":  So you mean water is flooding New York City?  Scientist:  Yes.  Disaster "Expert":  Now I must brave the elements with my two friends here (who have no reason to go with me and who  will  die) and make a pointless journey to New York and save my son!       It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone if it's as bad as they say it is.  Godzilla  stunk.   urlLink Fox News  also reported that the new Harry Potter film  urlLink The Prisoner of Azkaban (out June 3rd) was pretty good. The guy who wrote the review is not a Harry Potter fan, so I can only take his review with a grain of salt. He said the opening sequence (Harry Potter inflates his aunt) was priceless.   There's  urlLink talk  according top the New York Post that the movie's producers might not hire the current Harry Potter actors back after the fourth film because they're getting too old.   I don't think hiring new, younger actors will do any good to the film franchise. In fact, I think it might ruin its current success. It's like making an Indiana Jones movie without Harrison Ford or making a Rocky film without Stallone. I guess only time will tell how any changes will affect the Harry Potter movie franchise. At this point, I don't see it as a good thing.   Controversial filmmaker,  urlLink Michael Moore  won the Cannes Film Festival's highest award, the Palm d'Or, for his "documentary"  Fahrenheit 9/11  (It should be taken into consideration that the festival is French).   This came as no surprise to me, but it is upsetting, because his documentaries are not really documentaries. Mr. Moore has such a way with words and footage that he can put a really good spin on the truth to the point that it becomes an outrageous lie. Check with   urlLink MooreWatch.com  or  urlLink MooreLies.com  for more developements. I'll rant MOORE about this later.  Word.
