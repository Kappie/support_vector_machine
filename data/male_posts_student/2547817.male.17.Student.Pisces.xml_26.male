The option comprises of General Paper, C math, Economics, Chemistry and Tamil. Mother tongue. Derived from "Tongue of the motherland" I'm sure. I was also called for the second round of interviews for the U.W.C. scholarship. I know I should feel... happy... I don't. WHY?  There is no, and I mean NO music like the oldies. The veterans like Queen. That's what it's all about. Vocal harmonies in over 4 different parts. Never would I have fathomed that it were feasible, let alone entirely possible. Well, then again, I probablly would've thought of it but would have been too lazy to do anything about the notion.  I miss Hazel so much. There hasn't been a day I havn't thought of her. I just spent 4 hours putting together notes for her from my sec 4 papers. What the hell kind of "just a friend" am I? This is usually the part people break into their overy interlectual jargon which people dont understand but read anyway. I suppose, in a way, be it subconsious or not, the author of this smack feels.. what? smart? clever? unique?  Gimme a break. Good night.
