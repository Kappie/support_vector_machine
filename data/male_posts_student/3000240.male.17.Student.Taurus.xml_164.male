Last week, before  The German  went of to Alicante for a fortnight, we became closer than ever. We were in the student room of her house (which strangely after so many stayovers, was a room that completely evaded my attention) and be-fittingly for this new room; well we found a new experience to our friendship so to say. After the fondling, kissing, hugging and outright naughtiness, and I was too scared/dubious to try anymore, and I knew I didn't trust myself around her for the foreseeable evening, and so I insisted I disappeared.    That  however wasn't before I learnt I might be meeting the worlds cuuuutest guy - yes that's right - CHARLIE HUNAMM!!! Yes Barbara is fixing a new series with 2 of the cast including blondie and I may be able to come along for the "ride".  After this, Jen put the iceing on the weekly cake, with the fact that I will not be seeing Anna until the  13th Slimelight Townie vs Goth  edition, easily more bareable with the news that she had made contact with Skittles AT LAST, and tonight she had a KICK ARSE haircut - lovely to behold.  Anyway in the last few days I've been to the peel twice and the cinema several times. All films - Spiderman 2, Around The World In 80 Days, and well with the exception of the kids orientated  Thunderbirds , were all fabulous, and the two gigs involving my evil twin, or evil twin, or whatever they are both pronnounced, were wonderful. This even though I hardly saw either of them, as Dan, Ali and tonight Baldwin convinced me that the strip bar behind the peel was far greater value for the evening.  Well naked women must have some appeal, but I haven't really seen it a great deal recently, oh Jesus that probably makes me queer doesn't it. Fuck it's not like anyone who ever reads this blog ever gives a shit and bothers to ever bring this or any subject up with me to help me with my criminalistic issues, so fuck it; I couldn't care less.   Lastly - Ian needs emotional support in the coming weeks/months after some truly traumatic turn of events in his life, and I refuse him a day without checking up o E-Man's mental stability, even in Nice I'll try to manage the feat somehow. It would be rather inappropriate to spill the beans on this blog about the recent happenings with Ian, I mean if he wants to tell you what's happened, then get in contact and friendship with the great man himself, but if you ever read this Ian, then you know I'm here for you whatever. xBuBzx
