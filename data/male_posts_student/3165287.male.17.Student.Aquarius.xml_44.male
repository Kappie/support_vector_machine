This can be a turning point for my negativenesss...positive thinking works! Furthermore, the city's determination was felt through the radio broadcasts, telling the citizens that the fireworks are going to be carryed out as planned..for 4 times! Now, with all the "dishes" set on the table, all I have to do now is...enjoy!!! Ciao! :-)
