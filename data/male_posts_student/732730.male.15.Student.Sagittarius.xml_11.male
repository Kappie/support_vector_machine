Great, hey.  Ah well, split my night up a bit, which would otherwise be boring.  Speaking of stoners, Jesse is having a gathering at his place tonight. And guess who wasn't invited. If you guessed " Adam ", then you guessed CORRECTLY! Pfft... I don't think I'd be missing out on much. "Such 'n' such is soooo prime", "let's light up another joint", "chuck us another smoke" and "lets play with ourselves". Ok, I made the last one up. But MEH! We all know I'm right. Don't we =|  Anyway, I'm getting used to this not-getting-invited-anywhere thing. It's not a big deal, so long as school stays alright.  Corinne said that Tara said that I've changed since I started hanging around with Ellen. Well, T... I  dunno. Maybe if you stopped picking on me I might be more likely to hang around with you. All you do is whinge about my flaws. I don't think you've said a nice thing to me for ages. Or maybe I'm just imagining things. Yes, I think I am.   Meh, I have come to the conclusion that being unpopular has lots of bad things. WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE MEEEEEEEEEEE?!  P.S. Please note that this is [probably] depression talking.
