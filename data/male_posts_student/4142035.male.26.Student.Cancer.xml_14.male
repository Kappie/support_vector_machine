Thousands and thousands of years of killing and torture and anguish at our own hands.  I often thought of what would happen if everyone just refused to fight.  Know what would happen?  My guess is that the leaders of countries at war would either be forced to find another solution to their conflicts, or at least those who wage war or terrorize other coaters would become completely impotent.  What if everyone put down their gun, stepped away from the command console, and put the cap back on the big red buttons they push to set off all them great big ol'  urlLink WOMD's  and just said "Nope.  Not gonna do it.  Not this time.  No, you're nevah gonna git it."  America, the strongest country in the world, is declaring war on other countries?   It's the strongest country in the world.   Is it really necessary to blow other countries up to get things we want?  Is it even necessary to wage war to just effect some sort of world-wide foreign policy?  No way.  We're fucking America.  Not only should we be helping other countries maintain peace; we should be setting an example of peace to the world by not propagating the farce of "freedom fighting."   Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity. -Saw it on a bumpersticker
