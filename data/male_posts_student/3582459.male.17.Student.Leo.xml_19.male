I spend so much of my time thinking about morality and evanglism and philosophy, but I spend a much smaller amount of my time actually applying that same morality and philosophy, and spend almost none of my time evangelizing. This also is probably linked to my slurring of speech when talking to other people--because I spend the vast majority of my time thinking about things, I have a lot to say about some things, so I speak very fast. The fast speech compounds my natural speech impediment (I used to stutter, having trouble pronouncing soft 'w' and 'h' sounds such as "why" when I was very young), causing me to slur my words.   I hereby resolve to alter the balance of thinking to doing in favour of doing, and to speak more slowly and crisply.
