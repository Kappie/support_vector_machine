Zeke (thats me!) has no more first gear in his car.  this would be ok if he lived in western KS but he lives in Lawrence, the land of many hills.  It was a serious setback to the fuure of his money making and fun having experience.  Thats ok though because a fairly amazing girl named Lauren (her stage name) has promised to ease his pain by practicing all her pleasure giving delights on his body.  What a lucky guy..  Well other than that we had initiation last night which was boring and KU and MU lost today so I went out and ate and drank with my Mom and sis and Kalina.  Didn't seem to drink enough so I'm off to the bar to continue this trend of inebriation..  More later and everyone enjoy their Superbowl extravaganzas...  Lata' Homes...
