However i did manage to squeeze some time to meet up with my cousin during lunch break. Unfortunately , she was stingy and she refused to treat me . Sigh. Some cousin she is ( just kidding! ) Last night, we had a mini party at our friend's place and the girls cooked dinner. Not for us though, we already ate. Homework is starting to pile up. Not a good sign.....  Woke up this morning at 7.30am thanks to my dearest friend Daniel who was so kind to give me a morning call ( DAMNNN YOOUUU!!!! ) I was feeling drowsy. Class starts at 11, and HOI ( History of Ideas u noobs ) was first on queue. As expected, history is never fun. The whole class nearly felt asleep , and Kafaii described her as Jigglypuff ( Those who play Smash Bros should know wat it means ) And thankfully there was no psyhics lab in the afternoon so YEAAAAYYY free time!!! Finally got some time off to relax. Had to teman kafaii to bank to settle some of his stuff. The weather is getting colder and colder.....  *** My posts are gonna be real short starting from now cause everyday life is kinda the same now so ill just put stuff thats out of the ordinary =) ***
