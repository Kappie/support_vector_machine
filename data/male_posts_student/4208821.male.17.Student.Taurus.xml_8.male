Printers not accepting paper, kiosks crashing, not-so-bright employees, sups quitting, angry guests, rain - could there be anything else? I try my best, so whatever happens, happens. I've also seemingly finished the program I designed to handle tracking of the number of pictures printed per photographer and hopefully the backbone of an incentive system. I'd have to say it sucks that Anheuser-Busch can't pay it's employees extra like the incentive program due to fairness between departments and parks. Maybe I should start an amusement photographers union. I'm just rambling now.  Regardless of my day at work, I'm still in a pretty good mood with 19 days before school starts. I still haven't really touched my AP US History work yet, but it'll eventually get done I'm sure - maybe Friday or Sunday when I have time to do something about it. College apps are also creeping up on me but I'd like to get those done early so I don't have to worry about them during school. So far Bucknell seems to be on the top of my list and then maybe the other schools I liked from Viriginia like UVA, W and possibly U of Richmond. Time seems to be the enemy lately, though.  I'm still looking for used computers/hardware to mess around with. I'm hoping that I can possibly make my computer service/repair gig into a more profitable and consistent work experience too. Currently, I'm charging $10/hr for my services but I'm thinking more like $15 would be appropriate. Seems like most of the work I do is spyware removal or trivial computer setups. Rarely I've had to reinstall machines or replace hardware. I'm fighting the urge to blow my next paycheck on more hardware, so the only place I'll be picking stuff up from is friends or computer recycling centers. Hopefully my dad's clients are effectively using the piece of software I wrote for record conversion so that he can think up more programs for me to write during the school year.  I'm hoping I'll get an email from the guy running the Reality section of the Courier Times soon to know if I'm on the board. Even if I'm not I plan to write more editorials for submission anyway. Hell, I have like 5 more to submit and I heard good things from the first one. Perhaps something on the upcoming elections will be the next piece. Right now though, I'll stick to blogging.  Maybe this blog will be a testing ground for my work.
