Yesterday, I decided that I would explore the shopping scene and I ended up buying a rather fine dip pen from an art shop :       It works incredibly well, uses an 'italic 3' nib and I'm quite proud of my first drawing with it (on tracing paper and coloured using Photoshop) :       More purchases were purchased during yesterday's travels : several books ('The Encyclopaedia of Cult Children's TV', 'The Pocket Essential Laurel  Hardy', a previously 'unknown-to-me' translation of 'The Little Prince', with colour illustrations and 'It Must Be True - A Collection of newspaper bloopers, misprints etc.') and also a bottle of black Quink ink for my dip pen !  Today, I've been sitting here listening to Green Day's version of 'I Fought The Law' and 'Camp Grenada' ...
