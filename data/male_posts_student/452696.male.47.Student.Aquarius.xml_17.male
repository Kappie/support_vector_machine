Probably slipping into a bit of a funk, but hey, I learned that during the renaissance, artists were considered to be of a melancholic temprament. I don't really want to be though. It's a depressing negative space to be in. I completed a website for a friend of mine who is doing humanitarian work in Guatemala. Check it out, it's called  urlLink Ayudamos .
