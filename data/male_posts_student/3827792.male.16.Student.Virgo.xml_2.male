So is good for me this type of lazy pple. So actually I nv regret gettin a mic as it helps in me doing my work. I am damn pissed off wif one of my classmate, and I have decided to end the frenship here. So well, he has done something which he shld not have done in the first place, after all i have hold my temper for quite a long time, so well, i dun mind ending this frenship tis way, so well, i guess things come and go. So well, gtta go feelin damn stress.
