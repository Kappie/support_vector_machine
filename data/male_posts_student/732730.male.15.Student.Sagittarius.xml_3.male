I gotta go in like... 3 minutes coz we're boarding soon, but as soon as I get back home I'm posting. I have some interesting news, too (not really).  But, I did see Kieran even if it was only for half an hour, but it was still good. I say he's pretty fine, so it's all good. I would have seen him for longer if it wasn't for his god damn mother! GRRR!  We went to Movie World, too. Was great fun. I became a roller coaster addict... Woo!  And um, yeah. More in about three hours (when I get back to Cairns!)
