I was sitting through the ceremony waiting to get anything except this, the only one I really wanted. And I got it. I am so incredibly happy. Out of every student taking Japanese, I was the one they picked. I'm more than a little shocked.  And hey, I got $50. Which more than makes up for the misspelling of my last name.
