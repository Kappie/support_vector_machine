The football ground was slushy because of the rain, so the ball kept skidding around a lot and neither team had much control over the ball. Still, our team (first years) won 2-1 and there was much jubilation thereafter. The second goal came in the dying minutes. It was an absolutely stunning free kick taken by one of our defenders from the halfway mark, curving straight into the opposite goal.
