So, as you can guess, i was Zephyr.(Duh) Remember i have been playing this for a few days only, so i still consider myself a newb.(Newcomer with very little respect earned from the others) Anyway i enter the game, check the weapons selection...They removed my M79 and my Socom!What would become of me?!? Oh well, i take the Steyr and the Bazooka. The Steyr Aug is a bit more difficult to use than the M79, and the bazooka... I started playing and could'nt believe what i wasd doing! I was owning everyone, imagine neo againts the agents at the end of The Matrix. I was second the 2 first rounds, third one i got first, I had only time to take a picture then the admin banned me.  I finally emerged from the Noob state, call me an Middle Level now!  Bow down before my power!  Regards,  Zephyr
