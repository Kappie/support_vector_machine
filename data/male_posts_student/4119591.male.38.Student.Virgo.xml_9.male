A group of us at work have pooled a few dollars between us to leverage our chances of winning something. This brings our odds to something approaching the odds of being struck by lightning while being crushed by a falling piano filled with circus clowns.  I don't normally play the lottery. A friend of mine likes to think of state and national lotteries as "taxes for people who do not understand statistical probability." But with the jackpot being so very high, it seems silly not to at least try.  There is another fantasy involved: Imagine everyone in my office resigning on the same day. "Smell ya' later!!!" That unlikely scenario is worth throwing away a dollar or two. Of course, I would continue to work for free just because I love what I do so very much.  There's nothing so compelling as becoming suddenly rich and enjoying all of the trappings: big houses, world travel, celebrity, law suits, excessive substance abuse, jail time. Yup, when I'm rich, I'll remember all of you fondly and perhaps even use my phone call after booking and fingerprinting to ask you for bail.
