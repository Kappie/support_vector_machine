I can see the long road that got me here, I just wish it was as nice for the other travelers as it was for me, but it's not. All I can see, looking back, is pot holes created by someone else. My poor brother and sister. How can I mend those holes for them.   I can't. I can only love them. Damn the crappy way love turns sour. My parents are a mess. I can't seem to deal with it. I just wish a decision can be made and we can all just go on. I really don't have much to do with it anymore. What a mess.  Yesterday was pretty fun, I was bored for a little while. MiMi and I washed out cars and I waxed her car when she got home from work. She helped out with that too. It looks nice.   Around 11pm, her friend Cindy came over. Cindy is also manager of a Nine West shoe store. She was MiMi's manager before MiMi got her own store. Miss Cindy is super slender and almost 40. She laughs at everything and has some pretty funny stories of her own.  We drove up to Half Price Books off of 75 and Northwest Highway around 11:30pm. They had just closed so there were people still around. We got out and started looking in the dumpsters. Sure enough, my preminitions were correct. A guy came up and asked us what we were doing. I made up some shit about needing box's for moving. He watched us get a few boxes and we took off Pissed as hell - we all vowed to come back in a few hours.  We drove down greenville and came back, all the way past university and circled back around towards Cafe Brazil. We stopped and dumped the boxes that we didn't need and went in to have some food and drink.  I'm so not used to being in Dallas, I spend so much time in my neighborhood. Lots of open space in suburbia.   Anyways, we went back to Half Priced Books around 1am and got tons of books. I was paranoid being with two girls. There were lots of gawkers that would slow down to "check out the chicks" and that made me nervous. People do crazy shit to get sex and I would have a hard time defending a car full of guys trying to stick my wife and her friend. That shit freaks me out. I would go insane if that ever happened. Anyways, my nerves got the best of my and we left only after digging around for about an hour. I think we all found plenty of shit. I was satisfied.   I saw the security gaurd leave at 1am so just a tip. Go to Half Priced Books after 1am and on the weekends and there will be lots of books for free. This would be an awesome way of starting a punk rock library. Maybe those South Main kids would be interesting in this info.
