I might just look up his number tomorrow and give him a call.  I built frankenputer today. If you feel like emailing him his address is thepeopleunderthestairs@rogers.com - he's wireless which is really pleasant.  I think destroying part of the desk he sits on made me sick. *sigh* ah well.  The following new fathers and their newfound Guatamalish progeny are not loved by Jesus: Jerry King. That is all.
