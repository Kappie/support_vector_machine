I was annoyed because Tim kept on making all these Jew jokes and wouldn't stop. With Tim P. he would say something like that but he would stop when I would get pissed off. But Tim doesn't stop lol. Then I started on my math project and Stacey and I were trying to figure out the circle graph thing. So that's pretty much it.....exciting day, eh?
