I just wanna say some things before I forget.    Could anyone help me out? Suggest naman kayo ng mga kanta na sa tingin niyo ay poetic. (wag yung Vincent, kinuha na ng ibang tao eh). This is for Eng 11, so only English songs. (OPM/J-Pop fans please remain seated!) I'm already considering Stellar and Ghost in You, so anything that is a touch more thought-provoking would be nice.    I got my speakers up and running! Woot woot!    Narinig ko na yung Astro. Astig! Would it be weird if I said I thought Che Che was cute? It must be those braces... I'm a bit of a sucker for braces, weird as it may sound. And, err,for glasses as well... I am such a nerd. >_   completely wrong thought of the day: *today's somewhat altered dialogue from AS iscourtesy of urlLink Jam *  Jam: Patingin nga nung curriculum ng BS Math. me: Sure. *hands over curriculum* *Jam stares at the paper for a while* me: Hey, I have a question. Ano yung Math 1? Math for general knowledge? (or something like that) Jam: Yan ata yung history of math eh... me: Ano naman 'tong Math 2? Math for everyday use? Jam: Hmm, basic math siguro. me: They should rename Math 1 "Math for retards". *both of us laugh* Jam: Ang sama mo! me: Oh wait, dapat ata Math 2 ang math for retards... Say, what's worse than a retard? Braindead zombies? Living vegetables? Jam: Wag kang ganyan! Marami akong kilalang Math 1 no! me: What, and they're all retarded? Jam: Ang sama mo talaga! Math for Morons kaya... me: Onga no! Walang dating yung iba eh. Basically, Math 1 is Math for Retards and Math 2 is Math for Morons. Right? Jam: Math Major ka nga!  I can't really diss people for taking Math 1 or 2 though. Given a chance, if, say, I had a different course, I would probably take that as well. Hey, it's an easy uno, and an uno is an uno is an uno,right? Besides, it isn't as if Math 17 is that much harder I guess. I just like to... hmm... "exaggerate," if you will. :D  Hindi ko na lang nadagdag "E pano kaya yang Math 11..." Peace. ;P
