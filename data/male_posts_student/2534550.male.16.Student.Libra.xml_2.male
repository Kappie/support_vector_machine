I've had to come to this realization, and now have found a magnificent way for us all to stay "in touch" with each other over the season:      Chels: i just figured out why its ok for you to march Magic Jess: ?? Chels: because Chels: PURPLE is BLUE mixed with RED(for Renegades, who we will march when we're wrinkly) Jess: lol Jess: and magic has red in their uniform.. and black pants, like BD Chels: and we have a purple stripe across our chests Jess: like BDB even Jess: yep, there we go Chels: and and and Chels: i wear a red sports bra Jess: lol yep Jess: i'll buy one for this season, just to tie everything together Jess: or better yet, i'll buy a blue one lol Chels: yay! Jess: haha Chels: now what about austin? Jess: hmmm Jess: uhh Chels: i think i know what his christmas gift will be Jess: ?? Chels: red boxers. Jess: hahaha Jess: and purple ones Jess: well... Chels: no, cuz we've got the stripe, lol Jess: that might be too much Chels: dont wanna put him in that position Chels: i need red panties now Jess: lol yeah Jess: hahaha Chels: lol Jess: and we all have to swear to wear them on the same days Chels: which will be EVERY show Chels: it will be a tradition Jess: hahahaha well that could get kinda gross Chels: we must buy in bulk then Jess: lol yeah Jess: okay we're making this vow, we will wear red undergarments for every show Jess: are you sure you dont want to pick another random color? Jess: i've got red, you guys dont Chels: no Chels: red Chles: well Jess: you could wear red, i'll wear blue Chels: you blue Jess: yeah Chels: yay Jess: okay Jess: but if we're ever at shows together we have to wear the same thing Chels: eh? *cocks head to side like puppy* Jess: ohh ohh we could MAKE special undies Jess: well if we're at shows together we have to wear the same color, but when we're apart we wear different colors Chels: ok Chels: black then Jess: okay Chels: easy Chels: and wont show if we rip our pants like marco Jess: lol!    ...and now presenting....the undergarments of the 2004 BDB Bloggers!
