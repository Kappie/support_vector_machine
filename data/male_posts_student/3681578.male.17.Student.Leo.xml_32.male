It sucks when you have to cram a ton of work that you could have done earlier but you did not do just for you to have time to do more enjoyable tasks, not exactly worthless tasks like talking and talking in the Physics Block Bench, but doing or practicing or reading other stuff for the other (more enjoyable) aspects of your academic life...  At least I have solitude later, peace and serenity, as my sister and mother will be going somewhere...Yipee! I have all the place to myself...  I have not yet bought the ECE Power Supply Kit and I have absolutely no idea how to buy it...I mean, maybe on Monday...just maybe...or maybe I can ask someone else to buy it for me...  There...Shit! We have a report in Lit, War by Luigi Pirandello, and my mind can not make anything much out of the story...  Um, I should actually spend my time more productively now so I might just solve some math problems along side reading the whole of Hulagpos along side writing note cards and the stupid progress report for my research paper in English...   --Logged Out--
