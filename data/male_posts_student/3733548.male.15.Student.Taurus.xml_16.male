Off of that subject now thanks, Ive got some cool teachers, and a  few  cool friends, I'm trying to stray away from the crowd that I was in last year, yet they are the only place I fit in, I trust God to help me. Which I am cool with doing. And it shouldnt be hard to do. on the 23rd I start college, and second semester I am a Seinor, wich I am technically now, but literally I wont be until next semeseter. So thats that. Goin to Adam's tomorrow. should be good, Ill post again from there. Goodnight.
