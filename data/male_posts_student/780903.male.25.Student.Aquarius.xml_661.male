I've got a tube of it in my room; I just didn't think about it.  Argh.  Note 2: The Office of Career Services has an online appointment-making system.  About a week ago, I set up an appointment with one of the advisors for 10:40 this morning.  Not realizing it's Labor Day, but also not really caring.  The system sent me a reminder yesterday.  I'm going to show up at 10:40.  My gut tells me no one's going to be there.  We'll see.  Note 3: I have no note 3. I thought that typing "Note 3" would inspire me to come up with one.  It didn't.
