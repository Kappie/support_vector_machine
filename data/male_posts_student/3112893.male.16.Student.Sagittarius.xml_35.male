I was lying in bed for over 2 hours trying all kinds of trick that usually work for getting me tired at 3:40. I even tried doing those relaxing anti-stress things, but just ended up exhausted and still unable to sleep.  Anyway, it hit me much, MUCH earlier this morning that while I may good at about everything I try (except dancing, any and everything that requires "grace" (except soccer), and being without my music collection), and while I may have been raised an engineer, I think I might want to be a political scientist or even a musician. I don't know how to read, write, or even play most music, but I just have so much fun when I learn how it works. It's got that cool "it's theory, but it's also tangible" factor, which is really appealing to me. Political Science seems cool to me though because I took this class at Harvard Extension on American Political Theory from 1600 to like 1890(? I forgot the exact dates, but it was pretty much from the colonies until woman's suffrage) and I think that it was the best class I've taken (well, I've only taken 4, but it was the most interesting reading I've done in a long (*stretched 'o' sound* I just feel stupid typing a bunch of o's and it's kinda ugly) time). So, I dunno what I'll do. I'll probably just float back to engineering of some sort because I've been around it for so much longer and feel more cozy with it. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.  Oh, what ever will I do? Well, I guess we have until sophomore year of college to figure that out, don't we?  That is all.         -- Feanor
