Well, I went to Maria's house to watch 'Bowling for Columbine', but we ended up watching 'The Debut' and 'Bowling for Columbine'.  Well, anyways, I figured I'd be home around midnightish, and boy was I wrong.  Daniel, Angela, and I went to Tim Hortons to talk for a while, i thought a while would be an hour and we'd leave, but oh my, did we ever talk!  We talked about everything!  We went from philosophy and ethical questions to ribaldry!  Time seemed to fly by like nothing, before we knew it we were talking for two hours, then three, then four!  *laughs*  I had a great time though, I really got to know Daniel and Angela a lot more.  And that's what life's about: living.  Living doesn't have to be jumping off of a plane, it can be a nice chat in a coffee shop until four in the morning.  I had a great time, I can't say that enough.
