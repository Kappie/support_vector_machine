Even though everybody grows up to a certain point where they rarely cry, sometimes they still do.    And sometimes I feel like nobody cares about me. Maybe it's because I don't get my way, and the person that became the instant scapegoat said something to upset me. Which is what I feel like when I have to mow. I end up being really mad about it, and(having a big yard) spend two hours cutting the grass and at the same time plotting of how to kill somebody 400 different ways.     *NOTE*  I love the 400 numbers. I  don't know why but if you ask me to tell you something that involves numbers it will most like have the number "4 hundred something"  *END OF NOTE*      Don't mow your lawn if you have a big lawn. End of statement.  ANYWAY, *sighs* I need more people to talk to. To fellowship with and be a part of their lives. I need someone to take up my time, and someone to be a league in my life, and me, to play a part in theirs. Don't bother sympathizing for me, because I don't care. This wasn't written to gain sympathy, it was written to tell you how I feel. Is that not the reason for weblogs? To hide your secret feelings and thoughts?       *NOTE*  Post your ideas about my weblog theorem in the comments section. I'll be glad to see feedback.  *END OF NOTE*    Today I've felt neglected, for reason of my own emotions, mostly. I guess I need to find  God . It seems so hard to try, doesn't it? The world has so many things to offer. And they're much easier to get, then from following  God  I guess trying to be a friend of  Him  is like getting on a train that rarely stops. It's hard to get on because it's moving so fast, but if you try and are persistent, like Wile E. Coyote(Yes, it IS spelled like that) then you'll eventually be heading towards a paradise.       I'm not being very persistant with that, though. Please pray for me.
