Because those who can learn from their past and use it to mold their character and their future will be the truly happy.   -Don't dwell in the past. For dwelling is a place to live, and noone should live in the past.  -Don't stress over the little things. The little things exist to get to you, so don't let them.  -Don't be negative. For when you are negative it drags other people down with you. Be happy and positive, in hopes that it will bring other people to that level.  -(this is not one of my own invention, but a common cliché) He who lives in a glass house should not thrown stones.  -In this world there are things that are going to drag you down. But if you let that happen, you'll drag down someone, and they'll drag down someone, so on and so forth until the inevitable collapse of a group of people.  -Don't be hard and insult yourself. For when you turn on yourself you have noone left to fall back on.  -(Another cliché) When life hands you lemons, make lemonaide! (Or lemon merangue pie....mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...pie)  -Racism. Stop It. (totally stolen from the Government of Canada)  -(stolen from song) Come on people now, smile on your brother, everybody get together, try to love one another right now!  -A smile should be a lantern to the world.  -Whatever doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. (GO OVERUSED CLICHÉS!!!!!)  -The glass is half-full and im holding a pitcher of water (11 MAY 2004)  Well, that about sums it up for now. As more come to mind, ill repost this (if it ends up in archives before more are added).  Thanks for reading!  With Love, Bobert
