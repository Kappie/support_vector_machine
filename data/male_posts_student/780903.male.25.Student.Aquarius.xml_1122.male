From  urlLink Columbia.edu :   We believe that, if approached thoughtfully, your candidacy for admission to law school may itself become a valuable learning experience, and not merely a bureaucratic hurdle to overcome. From  urlLink NYU.edu :   The living expenses portion of the student budget at NYU School of Law reflects 9 months of living in New York City. From  urlLink UMich.edu :   And the vibrant university life enveloping the city of Ann Arbor is but a few paces away. From  urlLink Stanford.edu :   The Law School welcomes individuals with... learning disabilities. Yeah, that last one doesn't really work.  I'm not trying to make any actual statement here.  Stanford's website, though, is remarkably free of hyperbole and unsupported assertions that just sound silly on their face.  So I had to take what I could get.
