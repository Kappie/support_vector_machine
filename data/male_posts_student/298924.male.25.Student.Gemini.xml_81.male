But besides Hanna-Barbera I never gave much notice to the people behind the scenes....I mean my dad gave me an appreciation for the late great Mel Blanc, who provided the voices for so many of the characters from Bugs to Tom the Cat, but I besides the voices (and I got good at telling a voice.....), I never really gave the artists their due....  Then I started to read comics and my appreciation for the artists started to come into play....I soon began to pay attention to the names that would show up at the beginning of cartoons and to my astonishment all of my favorite Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry episodes without fail were all directed by a guy named Chuck Jones....  Chuck Jones died this weekend....this is the man that gave us among others Wile Coyote and the Road Runner, PePe Le Pew, and Marvin the Martian....his characters had a distinctive look about them and you could always tell a Chuck Jones cartoon not only because of the way the characters looked, but the subtle humor....in his episodes of Tom and Jerry it was more than mad-cap hijinx....  Well at any rate I wanted to take a moment and give tribute to this man who at the very least kept a little kid with too much going on in his head entertained....there won't be another person like him....
