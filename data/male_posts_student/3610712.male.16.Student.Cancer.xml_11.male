We played nearly all of the Ã†nima album and quite a bit of the Undertow album. Then Sarah and I walked around for awhile and went to Cabrillo and talked. Then we returned, played some more, and left. On Sunday, Sarah came over at about noon and we watched the NASCAR race and watched a few movies. Then she went home at about 12:30 am. Good times. Auf wiedersehen.
