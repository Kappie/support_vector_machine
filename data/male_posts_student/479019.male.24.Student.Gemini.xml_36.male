That meant I missed yoga... oh well... no eye candy for me this week. Bummer...  In other news that book I needed was put on hold so that I can go back for it. It should be useful because it's about the  Commonweal  Catholic newspaper. There's a useful section on Catholic sentiments toward the Spanish Civil War. That's immensely useful for my paper.  I also managed to get 2500 mp3s full id3 tagged! Only 616 more to tag or delete (major organizing working going on on my D: drive).  ***
