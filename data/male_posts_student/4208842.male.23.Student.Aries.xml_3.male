Down you cascade spiral sweetly to the pinpoint ground zero of this cataclysm. This is  you. Colliding sight and mind out of which escape never occurs. We will dream with you as you mutilate your psyche, slashing furiously at the pupils of your mind dilated in terror. Fly from light and faith now  trembling sweetly she touches your hands drowned in blood.  -----------------------------------------  "Rave? We certainly did..." - Anonymous
