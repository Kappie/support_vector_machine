The guys on the list showed up threatening my brother for GOD knows why and he and his trailer park buddies...the ones I affectionattly refer to as the TP's...completely beat the living shit out of the guys. It was great. Bryce and his buddies all keep padlocks on their belts, and they used them today as brass knuckles. No more shit list...
