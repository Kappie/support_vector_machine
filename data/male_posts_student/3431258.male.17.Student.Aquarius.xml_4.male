Anyway, 2 bad news. I got my Akroma and my Phage stolen! I'm really pissed now. Also i installed a new game called GunBound. I got my ass kicked every single time so i got bored, it's uninstalled now.   Speaked all afternoon with  Euphemia . She is having difficulties with baby Sitting. Let's prey for her good health! I am bored now, and it's allready 11h00pm. What should i do?  Regards,  Zephyr
