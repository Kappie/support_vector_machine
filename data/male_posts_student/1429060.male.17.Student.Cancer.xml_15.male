Perhaps its a mental disease no one Found It's been almost a day since I had a cheerful idea No nightmare No dream Just dreary reality That sucks the imagination from Everything Don't hate me Don't pity me I just want an answer Life is like insulin Hate it, but can't do without it Take what you got Even if you never wanted it Somebody tell me Who I am And am I now?
