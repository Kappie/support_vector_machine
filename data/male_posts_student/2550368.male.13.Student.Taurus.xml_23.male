Halo 2 will rule.. HalfLife2 will be the best (I allready oredered it.. kinda (came with my GFX card))  I leave you with some crash test dummies: "How Does A Duck Know?"  How does a duck know what direction south is? And how to tell his wife from all the other ducks? You can cut a chicken's head off and it will keep on running and twitching  [CHORUS] When everything seems planned out when everything seems nicely planned out well the human race will come and smack your face  How come all my body parts so nicely fit together? All my organs doing their jobs, no help from me! A person pulls a spider's leg out To watch it keep on moving and twitching.  Satan lives here: on grain and earth, rain and air.  How come I just smoke and smoke and smoke  and curse every butt I spit out? All night long I grind my teeth and I wake up when I cough You can put me in and iron lung and I will keep on breathing and twitching.   - J3FFz0r
