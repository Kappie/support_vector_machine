      Yes, we have finally got our swimming pool open for the summer. I went in after I got done weed eating today, and it felt great. My  urlLink friend  is redisgning his site, and trying to add some frames, but I think that Yahoo is giving him touble.   Well I am off to a BBQ at my aunt's house, so I will not be updating my new blog today. Nothing happens on Saturday anyway. I will be back on Monday. 

      kill blogpost.exe
