Kindness is just a way to get others to submit to you and make you seem better.   We are always striving through violence and "unkindness" to reach a nice little equilibrium of peace.   We do so by using ideas like communism, capitalism, democracy, and (please don't hate) religion. Frequently, such things use fear (like religion, which controls us by saying there is a hell and heaven... we don't know, so we seek answer, and religion has such an answer. Funny, ain't it?) to accomplish something.   And again, frequently, lots of people die in the process of defending their ideas (Iraqis, Islamic extremist, anyone?).   Before you argue against the theory of ideas and their power to control mass groups, think about cults/religions. How did/do they manage to kill off people so quickly? By creating the illusion that they control the afterlife.   People believe so much into their religion that they follow it 'til death, they believe it is right and all others are wrong. Same as Commies vs. Democracy and Capitalism. They liked there idea, and we like ours. FIGHT! Plus, we defend our own. What else in the world doesn't protect their own? That's why we will always find a reason to fight.
