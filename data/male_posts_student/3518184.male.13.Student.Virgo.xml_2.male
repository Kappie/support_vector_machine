No wonder...it's fucking boring. I also had to make my schedule for high school. Yep...I'm starting 9th grade in September. Just PEACHY. I hate this...the guidance councler that was talking about my classes for next year was a bitch! Well I don't have anymore to say about today. Later.  Love to those that care, Mandy   Love ya Crystal
