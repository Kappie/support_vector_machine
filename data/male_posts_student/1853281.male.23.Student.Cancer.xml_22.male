I came home, did some crazy amount of reading and than went and got a drink and tried to not flirt with hottie mc hot waiter. He knows what i drink etc. WHat could be better. Newcastle is a god, and dirty stoli (or tanqueray) and tonics with extra dirty and an two olives is seriously paradise on earth. so good. Have to run to bed or i will be a bitch in my class tomorrow morning.
