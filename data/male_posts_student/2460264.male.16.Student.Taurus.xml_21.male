It's not to bad. I'm grilling up some lunch for myself, steak, and I'm gunna make bake some potatoes. mmmm... im excited. I'm feeling much better today then I was yesturday. Anyways, after I eat I have to mow the lawn... but I get paid so that's a good thing. Then tonight I'm going to the     SHOW TONIGHT:     4 Seasons Internet Cafe on Lilley, south of Ford in Canton. $3 (Proceeds go towards bringing in Matchbook Romance to headline a large local show) 7 PM - Madison AD, Mercury Shoes, Which Way Is Home, Crown Victorian (NY)...and recently added - Evan Baker and his acoustic guitar will warm up the crowd at 7:30.        I'm bored with my life, I need something(someone) exciting in it... hmmm I'm looking around. So, anyways... I'm going to go check on my steak. See ya later        ~Timmy
