China Club -> Located on 47th between 8th and Broadway. Local model, actor, and celebrity hangout, the Hiltons were not there tonight, sorry Adam. $20 dollar cover, supposedly a dress code (yea right). Doors are open from 10-4. $8 beers, $10 mixed drinks, at least.   We rolled in at 11-1130 pregamed 9 beers in thecar and headed in. Rick had some free pass and he gave it to me. The place is set up like a China town, with pagodas, bhuddas, and dragons. Two main dance floors and an outside lounge with a beautiful view of the surrounding skyscrapers. The music was a complete mix from 80's, to house, to dance, to oldies, to hip hop- everything. We had a couple of drinks and moved to the VIP section for a $125 bottle of Moet. Danced by myself a little, Adam got shot down like ten times, especially when he grabbed some girls tits, and Rick got a blowjob in the bathroom (still doesn't beat Andy fucking that stripper while everyone in the bathroom watched). My night was pretty boring, I am not going there to hook up, so it pretty much is a waste of time and money (someone was right). Rick forgot his digital camera in the car, but my father is buying me one as a going away present (so this thing will finally have some color). I got hit on a lot, and because I was one of the youngest there, mostly older women. One in particular asked me "what do you think women want?" I tried love, time, honesty, etc... etc... She replied "women want to be in charge of their lives." Pretty profound, it only cost me a nights sleep and about $150,thanks drunk bitch. We hit a pizza place across the street for late night munchies and I passed out in the back seat.   Well I just got home so its time for bed. On the way home I woke up two times. The first time it was to DMB "Superman" and the second was to OAR "crazy game of poker" or something like that. Weird.   Andy should be coming up later tonight, I hope I can hang. I am definitely getting to old for this shit. I will be nice to settle down one day and not have to go out anymore...
