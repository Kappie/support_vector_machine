One person thinks of an object, and says whether it is "animal" (including humans), vegetable, or mineral. The guesser or guessers must determine what this object is, by sequentially asking 20 yes-or-no questions about the object, which are answered either "yes" or "no". For example: "is it a person?", "is it someone I know?" ... If the guessers manages to work out what the object is after twenty questions, then they win. Otherwise, the person who thought of the object wins, and reveals what the object was.    Hehehehehe!
