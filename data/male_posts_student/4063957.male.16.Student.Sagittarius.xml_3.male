I work with 6 people in electronics.    Tammy  - she's the department manager, i don't really work with her much, cause she just came in after the whole ricky thing, but i'll describe that later. she's full time,i don't know her age.   Edwin -i've never seen somebody do so little work, honestly. i've tallied up some of the times he's been gone, it's been hours of a shift he won't be in the department. oh well, what can ya do. something like 23 or something. he always asks me how old he looks. i dont know.   Effie  - she seems to do her own random projects, she keeps busy. she's nice and supportive. she's a full timer. i don't know how old she is.   Robert  - i work with him quite a bit, fun guy to work with. i've had my share of good times with him. robert just graduated this year.   Rav  - Rav use to be my next door neighbour when i was like 3. he's great. the acclaimed 'beast from the middle east' is a riot. good times good times. rav's 22 or something.   Kegen  - i don't even know if i spelt his name right. i use to work with him lots, but he has a habit of giving away all his shifts for one week. so it's kinda sparatic when i see him. he's going into gr. 11.    people who i use to work with:    Chad  - well, this guy, without a doubt, was the best guy to work with while i was in electronics. unfortunately, he gave his two weeks notice days after tammy was named department manager. it's a pity. not only was he a great worker he knew how to make it relaxed and fun too. it's really a pity. i haven't seen him since he quit, so i don't know what he's up to, but i'm sure he's having fun. he's 18 or something.    Ricky  - well, i never *worked* with him. so i can't really say much. i'm not here to point fingers just from what people say. but whatever. i've heard good and bad. i won't even comment, he just doesn't work at walmart any more. (maybe people will stop asking me that now)   Well, my stay in electronics will be over in a few days. I recently applied and recieved a new part time position as a Customer Service Manager. that means a pay increase woot woot. I get to wear a red vest, not a blue one. so now the customers know who to hunt down. *sigh* oh well, maybe the extra 30 cents will be worth it. i get to job shadow the head CSM, Jane, on thusday the 29th, so, that'll be interesting, i still don't know what i have to do for a CSM though. oh well, it'll be fun. i got to do some more training on the computers last night. so now i can officially be a people greeter and i know how to delegate. it's funny how i didn't even know what delegating meant before last night. oh well, get off your butt and stop reading this. see that's delegating. well, i gotta go do some cleaning,  sincerly,  people greeter jared  oh by the way, i got 59% on my chem 12 provincial. but that's not important.    listening to:  'back home' - yellowcard     quote of the day:   'varsity sucks ice'  - someone's msn screen name i don't even know what varsity is. i don't know how it can suck ice. it's just a quote, and i haven't had any new quotes in 20 minutes since my last post.     feeling:  ready to shower
