Nothing like the sensation of knowing that you are going to have fun once the bell rings.  Fun is easy to have as long as you are named Tyke.  School was pretty stupid.  One comical event was when Tyke and Purdy were talking and she told him that she had felt the feeling that Tyke mentioned in a blog many blogs ago.  It was just like a painful feel and Tyke apparently described it really well cuz she understood it and felt it even.  So that meant that he is good at using words to convey ideas and that is quite a useful task in life.  Especially in his proposed career in which he needs to know the best word to use in a situation that creates the most vivid picture for his audience.  Hit them with one word and you will hit them with a million.  Whatever that may mean to you is probably true.  Not all things, Tyke can think of a couple that wouldn't be true, but for the most part make up your own meaning to that.  Well anyway the rest of the day eased by but was far from being easy.  After school the crew (actually too lazy to list everyone so sorry) gathered up their belongings and went off to the land of carpet dreams.  No, not Carpet Sense with Flynn but the Community Center to play some good old fashioned shirtless hoops.  As usual Tyke's team was shirtless (he seems to be that way a lot) and they were not that good.  Mainly cuz Kinker was on the other team and he was the best and had the most energy.  So he kinda dominated.  Tyke didn't have his outside jumper working too well and his legs were reaaaaaal tired from doing squats today but he trudged on to complete a solid day.  Far from his status quo performance but he will build on that and when some of the returners return next week Tyke should be able to take them on.  Oh yeah, Tyke wore 6 sweatbands and a headband.  One under his right and left knees, one on the right and left upper arm, and one on the right and left forearm.  Then of course the headband on his head.  It was definitely cute.  Too cute.  "Love me I'm a baby and I smile cute" cute.  "Oops, I spilled ketchup all over my shirt so I better take it off" cute.  Even "look at me I'm cute" cute.  2Kute cute.  Anyway he did that and it was done.  So then he went home.  Macaroon, Skippy, Kinker, Amed, and Tyronius came over later before the girls bball game.  They all played Halo and some games before leaving.  Then they got their pizza at the game and sat down.  Tyke and Haras talked during the game about the showdown against Sly Lion.  It will be a battle, which unfortunately will most likely be lost by the boys but oh well.  But the two got to talking about how Tyke needed to get real spirited for that game.  He already is pretty much Haras and the crew's number one fan though.  But like Tyke thinks that he and his crew or anyone else who wants to should make their own little group to rival the Olympians of Sly Lion.  Something like the Togas of years past, just good.  But that would mean some work and probably even some preparation.  Tyke and Haras decided they might have like a pre-party at Tyke or Haras' house to get everybody painted and oiled (Tyke just added that one now cuz it sounds nice) for the game.  Sure the "cool" seniors would think that all the guys are gay but FUCK them.  They don't mean shit.  Sorry for the outburst.  But Tyke likes himself more than those guys.  "Hehe, I'm funny."  Who was Tyke just then???  That's right...one of the senior guys who is actually pretty stupid.  So anyway though, the crew mostly came back to the land of Tyke and played some more games.  The hours from 10-12 passed way too quickly and were way too fun.  But the time is gone anyway so no need to get all misty-eyed.  Well, this blog has been far from a joy to read but what do you expect from a Friday blog?  Unless something really awesome happens to Tyke it is just gonna be a factual presentation of his factual day.  But today wasn't a day that involved ladies so nothing to report.  In fact, Tyke needs to have a night out with the ladies.  Not necessarily out but really the last time they all hung out was at the Christmas party which was like a month ago almost.  But that's aight cuz everyone has busy lives.  Not so much Tyke, which is really one of the reasons he can write such dedicated blogs.  And that can be thought of as both sad and the opposite of sad or "not sad."  But for all of you who are bored now you can go do something else cuz Tyke is going to also, if you know what he means.  Do you?  That would be really great if you did.  But answer him this...Where in the world is Carmen San Diego???  And speaking of San Diego...Dotti is like so totally cool.  Tyke really wishes they were talking right now.  Oh wait, THEY ARE!!!! IMAGINE THAT!!!!!  (pause 15 seconds for imagination)  annnnnnddd...SCENE!
