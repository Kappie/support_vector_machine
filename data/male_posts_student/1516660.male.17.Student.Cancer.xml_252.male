I went into Causeway to find Wendy to say goodbyes, but she was nowhere to be found. We met XC and then went to meet Hann at Yishun MRT.  We met Hann and went to his house. It was quite crampyed, but spacious at the same time. Contraidctory, I know. After a while, the rest went down to eat while I stayed at YH's home.  They came back after a while and we set off towards Tanjong Pagar Railway Station.      After a tumultonous journey wrecked with ridicule and insults, we finally reached the station.  At 9.30 or so, we were allowed into the departure hall. We had to go through the customs first. I was scolded for putting "Kelvin" in front og my name in the declaration card. "Kelvin" was at the back of my passport. What a shrew.  Ya know, before entering the departure hall, I had second thoughts. Sigh....being the butt of everybody's jokes is not funny at all. Sigh...just tolerate with it la.   This train is kinda bumpy. Heh. It's not THAT bad. I gotta go know. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
