Ok, so I knew that they were in my box of college stuff, but to get to it in the rafters was nearly impossible behind all the stuff from my grandmas and Jim and Jun.  Oh well.  So tonight I finally finished a long overdue picture.  I realize that my skills are not quite the best, but I hope to learn.  Oils are a bitch, thats all I can say.  I think I really like acrylic better during the painting process but I think that there is something about oil paints that just screams art.  I dunno.  Hard to explain.  But apparently my dad used to be a painter, and I saw lots of his stuff.  He has a bowling ball bag full of paints and brushes and he even has a gigantic roll of canvas.  Something to put to use.  Should be cool.  Lets see how inspired I get over the summer.  Maybe I should start by watching that Ross guy... You know.  Happy little clouds, majestic trees, etc etc.  He can help me get in touch with my inner hippie.    Oh yeah, I did take pictures of the masterpiece with my camera, but no unveiling until the rightful owner gets it back.    Colorful Rock.
