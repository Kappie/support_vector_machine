Maybe it's a little corny to admit it, but perhaps more than any group (Lifehouse being the other one) they've helped me through some hard times with their music and messages.  It's so weird to me how music and lyrics and all can come to symbolize something greater than the acoustic waves they're made up of, but that's the beauty of the mystical nature of so many things that we take for granted.  Anyway, the concert was totally awesome.  Because of all the rain the last couple of days Clay's Park (where the concert was) was really muddy, but that kinda made it cooler (some people came out of it looking like they just got done playing rugby :P).  And I have to admit that I was pretty emotionally dead when I got there; going to concerts alone is kinda hard for me (both because it's not as much fun as with other people and because I'm not the type of person who spontaneously talks to people - I think I only talked to two people the whole night, one of them being the guy who helped me park me car and the other being a woman who commented on my GCC shirt I was wearing).  And I'm not really into the whole ska thing (Supertones opened), so I mainly people-watched while they were performing.  I definitely think that Switchfoot puts on one of the best shows I've seen.  Unlike a lot of other Christian bands they don't get caught up in stupid banter on-stage or try to proseletize too much; they just get up there and let their music speak for itself, and they present it unadorned with any extra fashionings that might detract from it.  But they're also really passionate about their music, I would say right up there with Third Day and Jars of Clay, and that comes through, too.  Anyway, I think I'm going to go crash and get some sleep tonight.  Tomorrow could be a really busy day - I have Spanish in the morning, then I'm meeting with my contact at the Cleveland Public Defender's office (and his boss) to see what I could for them.  Hopefully everything will go well and I can start interning there soon!  Then it's back to Grandma's and off for our volleyball playoff games, then back home to do Spanish homework.  And who knows, maybe I'll hear from some of the companies I put in applications for night work?
