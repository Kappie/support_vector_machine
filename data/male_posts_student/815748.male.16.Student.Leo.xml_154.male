I realized something funny to say in math: "Inequalities are so racist.  Separate but equal?  I don't think so."  Archery was good again; I was on Monica's team.  In French, Ian and I disrupted the class by laughing noticeably at this picture in the workbook of three students who had written "2+2=5," "2+2=6," and "2+2=7," respectively; we didn't notice why it was there until chemistry.  In chemistry, Matt and I noticed a folder on Ms. Srikanth's iBook called "ARNAV," (her son's name) and a file called "dream india," and we thought it would be cool if there was someone named Norman T. Gorman whose parents told to be Mormon.  Ms. Heidlage is back, she spent the whole class talking about her trip to China.  That was fun, and the following quotations were said (the first was intentional and educational):  "Capitalism is man against man; socialism is the other way around." ---Ms. Heidlage  "I obviously knew Washington founded the country and Lincoln freed the slaves.  But like I didn't know FDR played ping pong." ---Jake G-A  This post is so Melodyesque.
