We've bonded fairly quickly and the more I talk to you, the more of God I see. You are an awesome friend and your just really cool! So yeah, you've got wisdom, and plus you've got some charisma there too. It's giong to be interesting to see the ways God will use you. =D  Jason Man: Ok so I dont know you really at all, but by asking for prayer you made your self vonerable and asking for prayer rocks (i'm prayin for ya BTW) I'm hoping sooner or later I'll get to know you better and this shoutout wont be small next time!  Caleb: ID sums up alot of what I see in you. You've got a heart set on God and I admire your readiness to follow God no matter where it leads you. God's got some awesome plans in store for you! Also I love how al the awesome talents God has given you, you just give them all back up to Him. You glorify Him in what you do, and say, and I'm one heck of a lucky girl to have you as a best friend. You slow to anger, and quick to forgive. I'm always praying for you and I love you so much! Keep folloing God and know that through all the trials, it's most definantly worth it all. Rememebr that I am always here for you, and God there even more!
