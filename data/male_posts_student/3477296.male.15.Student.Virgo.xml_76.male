My day was pretty normal which means i didn't do any work. careers was funny because Draper comes in halfway through the lesson, says shes busy with something else and lets us all go to sport half and hour early. SCRAM was ok, the adjudicator was really nice and there were pretty funny moments in it. Hope we get into next round.
