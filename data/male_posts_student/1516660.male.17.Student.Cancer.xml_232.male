So surprising meh?"s) I felt so giddy. The lens this time were made to fit my new degrees (which increased 200 degrees), therefore, my eyes/brain were not used to it. Ergh...and you think I shouldn't blog and strain my eyes. Ha.   Oh my god. I am having stomach upsets these days. I visit the toilet at least 3 times a day just to clear my bowels you know!! I don't know what caused it lor. The things I ate are those I ate often, and nothing happened in the past. Ergh....  I have so many medical ailements. My chest hurts so much now. Specifically, my left chest. Last time, it hurts only about once or twice a month. Today, the strains happened throughout the entire day. Initially, I thought it was my heart. I could be having a blocked coronary artery. However, WQ told me his brother experienced the same symptoms too (and thought it was heart problems), but he found out that one of his lungs collapsed! Oh my god! Thankfully, the doctor said it coould be recovered. Now, WQ's brother had recovered lor. On the plus side, no strenous work, i.e. PE, can't be performed during the period of recovery. I don't know lor. I must go to see a doctor about this. Take a x-ray too.  However, complications arose. You see ar, my parents intend to do it on Monday. Monday I had chalet. I cannot delay the checkup. The strains are getting worse. However, I promised Wendy I would go to the chalet. This is like breaking a promise. I made Wendy happy for nothing. Sigh. A very difficult choice. I must discuss with Wendy later on. I am not gonna like the discussion. Neither is she.   I think I am ending le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
