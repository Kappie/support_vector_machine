Only had a couple of interruptions so far--my mom called to talk (read: yell at me) about some stuff, including my spending habits (which are admittedly atrocious); I had to eat breakfast; talked with Amanda Erisman on Messenger for a bit (though admittedly, I was still typing notes on Hobbes at the same time--I can multi-task!), and found out that Sarah Rosenberg is apparently engaged; I saw some pretty dust floating in the air, and had to watch that for a while (sometimes  anything  can be distracting, if you want to be distracted enough).  Now it's time to integrate what I've got with what I had. Dunno how well this will work, or how unwieldy the finished product will be. Guess we'll find out.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: Toad the Wet Sprocket, "One Wind Blows"
