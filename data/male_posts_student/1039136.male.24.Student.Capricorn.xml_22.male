When I became VP and Kevin became President, we sat down and saw that there was so much work to do with the chapter in order to get it where it should be.  All summer has been spend creating new rules, revising old ones, creating committees, planning fund raisers, and trying to find a chapter house close to campus.   As far as the house is concerned, it's been a headache. Right now...its a week before the week people want to move into the house.  Between now and friday, I have to make sure the landlord sends me the lease, our national reviews it, we sign it, pay 3600 to the landlord and realtor and get all the shit settled. It's alot of stress on mine and kev's shoulders trying to pull all of this together.  I got home from stroudsburg last night and just crashed.  I just needed a few hours away from it all, so I shut off my phone, and just kinda laid there for awhile then went to bed.  Besides the house, another big stress point is going to school next monday and actually putting all of the new things into action and having to deal with the recoil from it.  People are going to bitch, and they are going to be the people who haven't done shit for the chapter all summer, so really I dont want to fucking hear it.  We're busting our balls to make the chapter great, any negativity can go fuck itself..and see itself to the door.  Ahh...so in other news..the gym..I love it..it's what I look forward to every day. I put on a ton of muscle this summer, and i'm on a good protein supplement. I cant wait to get to the gym today...sitting here at the comp is just fucking annoying.  I'm still trying to sell my digital video cam on ebay..let me tell ya..Paying as much as i did for that and people only bidding 50 bucks drives me nuts....ASSHOLES its brand new..comes with 2 extra batteries and a carrying case..WTF. We may as well call it EBroke.    Along with the frat money issues i'm dealing with, i have to come up with book money and frat dues money...  I guess looking at the big picture..nothing great comes without hard work, some hardships and dedication..i know that in the end me dealing with all this will produce a great result at some point...i'm sure when that happens i'll have a much happier journal entry...so sorry for any negativity..i dont think people like to read "this sucks..that sucks" kind of entries... anyway...pray for me..wish me luck..whatever.. ciao
