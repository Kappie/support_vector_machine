Some day I'll wish upon a star   And wake up where the clouds are far behind me   Where troubles melt like lemondrops   Away above the chimney tops   That's where you'll find me "      -Somewhere Over the Rainbow   Its been a month already, since school started. Boy, does time pass quickly or what? I feel like I've aged, gee. Its just "growing up" I guess -ponders- I haven't blogged for like, the whole weekend, basically because I've been thinking quite a lot. Mmm its like, I'm usually crammed up with all sorts of different thoughts and opinions and I just didn't feel like writing them out. But i'm finally back here anyway.  Well since it happened last week, I realised how we so often wore masks even if we were in front of our friends. Of course I realised this much earlier already, but all of a sudden I just felt it was something really scary, kind of? I know its just a defence mechanism that we so often use; when triggered by something that causes us to fall so hard. So why is it that while we are crashing inside, we're smiling on the outside? Is that being hypocritical? I don't know. Even around our friends, we try not to show how much its hurting inside, how vulnerable we actually feel, don't we just go around smiling and laughing to the jokes pretending nothing actually happened? Yet, just when a moment sweeps pass, just one moment when you're alone, everything hits you again. You are reminded of everything unhappy, how much its hurting and when you look around and find people smiling happily, should you feel happy? or rather feel even worse because you can't be that happy? Friends share good  bad, happiness and sadness, so what are we supposed to do?  Its ironic really, how people desire having someone, or maybe friends to understand how you feel whether its being happy, or sad, yet how is anyone supposed to know better what is going on when one doesn't dare to open up to other people? Is this how we always contradict ourselves? I know how it used to feel; being vulnerable and weak and you just wish someone would be there for you, yet the thought of telling someone else your thoughts just seems worse because then, you'll reveal a really weak side of you, won't you feel even more vulnerable then? I guess, that was why I used to keep everything inside of me, I was afraid.  Everyone has their first times, I guess I did too. My friends, my family, past experiences and most importantly, having you with me (: these are reasons why I'm happy.  I talked to Xing and Amy about religion, does taking part in sunday masses and church meetings make you a "truly devoted" person? How do you measure devotion? I don't know, but I don't believe its something you can measure just by the number of times you attend Sunday masses, go to the church on Saturdays or talk loudly about "God" in front of your peers or even strangers.  I am a Christian, I have been baptised. However, what is taking me away from my religion is my increased awareness of the people that turn me off; "Mormons who come up to you in the MRT train and talk about attending church with them the coming weekend", "or people who proclaim loudly they are a child of god, how they claim to be extremely devoted to their religion because they attend church and have God at the tip of their lips". Even though these are people that are putting me off Christ, but there were people, who inspired me to believe in the religion itself.  Sam Goh-- Even though I don't have his contact anymore, I can remember how he used to guide me with the bible, how he allowed me to confide in him when I had problems and how we used to go to mass gatherings and feel inspired after singing Hillsongs and a talk by our pastor.   "those were the days ." -smiles-  Religion, as I believe now, exists simply because we humans are too weak. We need something we can believe in, when there is nothing else we have faith in. Its almost like turning to the nothingness and pushing yourself to believe there is "something" in nothing. Maybe this is what we call  faith . Nothing is stronger than my faith in myself, in the people I love and cherish, and my very own thinkings. Sadly though, it is also religion that divides the people, think Islam and hypocritical terrorists whom in the name of "Islam" carry out acts of treason and terrorism. Even Christ and the Jews. "God" is a common name we believe in, maybe one day faith will bring us all together.  My father used to take my family to the Church at Novena, however, my mum's side of the family are buddhist, so in the end we are Freethinkers (: I guess that is why, I have both Christ and Buddhism inside of me.  I've been reading my manga lately, well almost everyday -grins- Naruto is a wonderful manga, not only the drawings but especially to me, the whole story and philosophy behind it. I don't know how to express it, really, but i'm gonna try. I've learnt quite a lot simply from reading my manga.  "Its told of how, some of us used to be really lonely, but that changes when someone finally recognizes your existence, when someones appreciates the things you do however trivial they seem."  "When growing up, we will find one day, that there will be someone you cherish more than others, maybe even yourself, and because of this "love" you want to protect this person, even if it might endanger your own existence, but we become stronger because of this desire to protect what you cherish."  "The desire to protect what you cherish, that is what I recognize as "true strength". "  We often lose things before we recognize its value and learn not to take things for granted and start to cherish them. I have lost certain things I really felt was important to me, but what is most important now is cherishing what I have, and who I have with me now -sighs  smiles-  Kesh once told me, that I was different from her, I have an "untainted mind". But now, I feel otherwise, I've seen the different sides of people, I have seen how things can change and when things happen, nothing can stop it. I have grown more cynical, I have to admit that. I don't like to lose in a discussion, debate or argument. But more importantly, I believe I am myself, different from everyone else, because I have my own opinions and thoughts.  I'm not sure what this entry/writing is about, but this is where I rant and where my train of thought, doesn't end.   I miss  xiaowei  -smiles-      know, being silly lovers just means you're in love.        ILOVEYOU     "And when the night wind Starts to sing a lonesome lullaby It helps to think we're sleeping Underneath the same big sky"      -Somewhere Out There
