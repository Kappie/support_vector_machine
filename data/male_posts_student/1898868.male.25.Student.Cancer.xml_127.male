I was also thinking about how I am so great at racing.  I spoke with Bob about it online.    joel:  i think there's almost no way i could ever lose to you in any sort of race bob: you are kidding me right???? joel:  no joel:  i'm totally serious joel:  maybe a car race, because you could use a police car bob: a running race??? joel:  but one of those treasure hunt races i would kick your ass in joel:  like cannonball run i mean joel:  i could beat you in any running race joel:  especially a sprint joel:  i could run circles around you bob: what about a one mile race bob: you are ABSURD joel:  backwards you might beat me joel:  i mean me backwards and you forwards bob:  Cannonball run race I would dominate joel: no way joel:  it wouldn't even be close joel:  i would be the greatest at finding treasure joel:  you would get your car stuck in mud trying to take some dumb shortcut  It's true, I am the greatest racer on the face of the earth.    Bagel, I am glad that you enjoyed the first picture that I put on here.  Here is a second pic for you.
