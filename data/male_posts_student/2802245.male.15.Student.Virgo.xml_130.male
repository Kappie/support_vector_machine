I never knew if you wanted your blog pic on the site, you know your actual pic, do you???  justincase you dont want it oni put a random pic in.    There aint enough content so i dont want people to go tothe site yet so iput the logo in and done under construction to make them think you cant view the site yet, gonna take all that page out when i get a bit more content and everything working.    Can we also get a proper logo for the site, that we can put on all our presentations cause i need to change all my good flash to bg studios.   If you want to add content to the staff site i.e comment or any other page then send an email to me  urlLink davidc_beckett@hotmail.com    thanks,  p.s if you havent noticed i put capital letters in (just to please han)      Beckett   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
