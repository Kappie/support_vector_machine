He's got a few challenges on his plate and the learning curve is steep - but that's alright with him.    So second day on the job, Jay is finding himself on an airplane again to meet clients in San Jose, CA with a few colleagues from the Atlanta office.    Imagine the fear when I checked my email yesterday afternoon to see a flight confirmation from America West showing that charges had been made to our credit card for a flight from San Jose to Toronto with a layover in Las Vegas.  What the!!!  Thoughts of identity theft ran through my mind as I quickly dialed Jay's cell.  Turns out it was him making the booking for his return flight from his first business trip with his new company.  Ummmm hello - he could've booked me a ticket too for crying out loud!  Hee!  But since he is charging all kinds of business expenses on his personal credit card (and racking up the air miles in the meantime), I do see a free trip out west to visit Cin and Norm pour moi in the near future. Yay!
