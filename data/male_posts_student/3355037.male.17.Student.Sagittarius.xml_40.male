Now time for some 'most inane details ofyou're (meaning my) life that no one in their right mind would actually care about' (straight from the blog of Karl.)   This morning, Kohler and I went to play tennis once again. We actually didn't do too bad and were both surprised at our performance, considering Tuesday's wonderful time. We also shot some hoops too. That wasn't all that great for once. Usually, I love to play b-ball (as long as the Vanilla Gorilla is not playing) but this time, it was all about tennis. I have learned to like tennis, thank you Kohler.   Today, as I was about to leave for Kohler's place, I noticed something. In our living room, there are individual pictures of each family member, witheach picture next to the others to form one giantfamily picture,on the wall, each one updated every school year. I happened to glance at the wall and it occurred to me. My picture hasn't been on that wall for years. I don't even recall seeing it up there at all. My dad has even told me before that this wall was for pictures of each person in the family. As I looked at the wall, that came to mind. I thought to myself 'Ok, so my picture isn't even worthy enough to be on that wall now. Great. I can see when I'm definitely wanted.' Usually, this type of thing would enduce a depression of sorts, but I just became very very neutral about it. It didn't even phase me a bit. I think I am joining Derek on the 'cold, cruel, and soulless' list. But that's fine.   Random thoughts: I remember what my best friend from 6th grade ( that was 5 years ago!!!) was like back in the day. We did absolutely everything together. The summer 'tween 6th and 7th grades, I think I stayed at his place at least once every week. Now, he is one of the most prolific stoners of C-town. This makes me think. If my best friend can change like that over the course of 5 years, then where are my present friends and I going to end up in 5 years down the road? Hopefully, not the same as the one described.  After thinking about that, it got me to start thinking about myself. Maybe my friend wasn't the one who changed. Wait. That's completely stupid. He  IS  the one who changed. But anyways, after thinking about that, I wondered how much have I changed in the past X years? It's impossible for me to not have changed but how much? How much am I going to change in the up and coming future? Am I even going to remember C-town? ... Do I really want to?   I think that's enough thinking for the day. It felt good to express myself like that. And that, Karl, is a reason for blogging.
