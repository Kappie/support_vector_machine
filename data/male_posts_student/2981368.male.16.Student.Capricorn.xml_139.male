At least we've had some good news already today: The other 2 teams in our group, Switzerland and Croatia, drew 0-0 when they met earlier today, which gives England and France the better chances to go through. Yay!  Also, Spain beat Russia 1-0 yesterday, but Russia played well, and they might just end up knocking Portugal out (with the help of Greece).   urlLink The Euro 2004 official website  is actually really good, I suggest you all go check it out.  And now I'm off to watch the game, I expect you lot are too, and won't read this till its all over. Ah well.  COME ON ENGLAND!!!
