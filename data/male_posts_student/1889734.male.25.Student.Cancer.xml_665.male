But there were some problems tonight.  First off, Niemenen should be put away in a dark room for what he has done - again.  This isn't the first time he's run someone in like this, and the hit was both stupid and dirty.  Good call by the refs there.  But the refs blew the first two minutes of the game.  They called a marginal penalty on Calgary, then called the roughing (which was fine), putting Tampa up on a 5-3.  Then when Tampa scored, the goal was illegal!  The Tampa player was clearly in the crease!  Inconsistency, and a lot of marginal calls through the entire game.  Still, I'm glad the series is tied.  I still can't decide which team I'd like to see win.
