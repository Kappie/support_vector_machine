Normaly i would just reply to  urlLink this post  but since i knew my reply would be a big one, i'd rather have it come up as a new post (Since it strikes some new rants anyway )I will quote the reply and go through it in pieces, lets see what i can come up with;   You dared me..so I will take on the challenge. I will take you on for several reasons. Primarily because you appear to a misguided young man, smart maybe, but severely misguided. Let me explain before you get angry at me. I am a very reasonable, pleasant, intelligent woman. I am a young 28 years old and I dont claim to be the most mature person I dont, so dont misunderstand me as I take on your "big mac boobie" challenge.    How am i misguided? Is it because i like to make fun of things for no reason at all, is it because i offended you as a person whilst i never even directed my rants towards females in general, let alone directed them at a specific person.  You ask me not to misunderstand you as i am about read your comment, how do you expect me to understand someone who is clearly comming from a biased point of view. I'd like to think you just ignored the fact that i was joking around, just so you can rant away about how wrong and evil i am, tho i know you didnt see it was a joke, and actually thought i was serieus.   As far as claiming you and your friend discovered the "ultimate truth" to your tastefully chosen term "boobies"...lets start with that issue. It was your first sentence of course. Im sure that the male population would love to hear your well educated and emotionally mature version of the ultimate truth. To ever claim you have that type of knowledge is absurd, let alone to claim you can speak for the rest of mankind. In the future, when you decide to be "philysophical" (for lack of a better word) about the female anatomy, you may want to adopt a more tender and meaningful demeanor...it gets you more chicks.    yeah i claimed it was the ultimate truth, some people have other view points on things you know. Christians believe that in the end it will be only God, while Bhuddists say the the human soul will reincarnated. people have different perspectives on the truth, i'd like to think my viewpoints on life are the ultimate truth since i do not believe in any god nor theory's about a possible afterlife, i never claimed nor asked of anyone to adopt this as their truth as well. As for the term boobies; I could have decided to go for a more educated term and title such as "Breasts are in my humble opinion the same as a fast food product" fact of the matter is that i did not. I choose to have the title up there with youthfull terms such as "boobies" only to thicken the effect of the joke, once again you completely missed the point. I never stated this was going to be a well-educated or emotionally mature essay, i said Boobies are like BigMacs, you dont honoustly expect it to be something of significance now do you?   Briefly I will touch base on the obvious..you come off like an ass kid!! How is that for obvious. It's unfornutate that your picture shows a nice looking young man...your words show an angry, ugly, pimple-faced, hostile, inappropriate dick. When in your life did someone tell you it was appropriate to refer to women as pieces of meat, upgradable possesions, free for all until you pay for them and useless if touched by another man. Frankly, your whole attitude scares me and I can only hope that when I have children they learn how use thier intelligence a bit more wisely than you!!    I come off like an ass kid? yeah, i like the female ass, but i also love the female breasts, the female hips, the female legs, the female eyes. Bassicly i love everything about females, whats there not to love? Loving it is one thing, but wanting it is quite another, dont confuse the 2. My words show something ? My words show you what you want them to show, they can either show you a pimple faced geek like you so nicely explained, or they can show you someone who has to much free time on his hands and just starts to think up stuff like this. Words are expendable, people have different views and each human beeing takes things in another way. i will respect your view of me and leave you with it. Whoever refered to women as pieces of meat, while in fact you are a piece of meat, just filled with a soul, just like me. I certainly didnt. i refered to breasts as upgradable, not the female itself. Who made me think breats are upgradable? Women did, when they pump their breats full of silicones to get a bigger cup maybe, they are upgrading their breasts, i dont care whatever term you want to use for it, its still an upgrade. Your remark about women beeing property and men beeing able to buy them is on i saw comming a mile away. True i did express it in a very demeaning way and you have my apologies for that. But im not going to apologise for saying that women are buyable and that you can in fact pay for them. Why do i not apologise for this remark? I never  stated the payment method, you just asumed i was going for the obvius payment method of money, whilst in fact the tought of paying for a woman with money hadnt even crossed my mind. Yes i hope your childeren will use their inteligence a litle more wisely then me. I never claimed i am perfect, i already made so much mistakes and i can only hope your childeren will be wise enough not to make the same ones.   By the way, I am a Registered nurse in labor and delivery. I can speak about "boobies" and female anatomy. Why?...because I have the experience and knowledge to back it up. I also have a nice set myself that have remained round, firm and tight despite how many men have touched them. Please go look up the word "double standard" in the dictionary.   So, because i am not registerd as a nurse and whatever i cant talk about them? true, i may not be able to speak of breasts with the same knowledge as you, but i do not have the need to go into an inteligent conversation about breasts and their artributes.  How is that reference of your breasts beeing touched by many men important? Did i ever state that breasts actually go bad as they get touched? No i said i felt they lost a sense of new...before i read the dictonary i sugest you just learn to read.   In fact, I am a married woman who believes that my beautiful "boobies" shouldnt be allowed to just rest behind closed doors. I am a bit of an exhibitionist *look it up if you need to. My very mature husband has no problem with my toplessness, because the womans body deserves freedom and respect.  I dont expect you to understand or adopt that mentality, but I do expect the men of today (that includes you) to respect women. Its actually cool to respect them, they hook you up when they like you..you should know this by now.    Agreed, "boobies" shouldnt be locked up. I also have no problem with your toplesness, where did you get the idea i have a problemn with breasts, evenso, where did the idea i hate naked breasts come from? Your examples are very cute and also very misplaced, i never said i dont want breasts to see the world and vice versa.  As you can see i have bolded a specific line in your text, this is the only thing i do not agree on. You expect me to respect you? On what grounds? on what terms? have you done anything to gain my respect at all? No, neither have i so i dont ask you to respect me. If you want my respect you need to earn it (speaking in general here), im not going to respect you just because you think you need to be respected. Dont get me wrong, i respect your valid opinion, but that is since its a factor that makes life, howver i do not have to respect you as a person, wether you be male or female because you may want me to. i dont even know you as a person, how do i know i even like you (no offense) You cant just demand someone's respect, it needs to be earned.   I am not saying all women are wonderful, just like many men out there beat thier wifes...we ALL can suck sometimes!! You have inspired me to write an essay myself..."How men are like hot dogs" I will detail the differences b/w franfurturs,saugys..oh yeah and we cant forget the foot long hot dogs. We may like our buns toasted or fresh. The words "plump and juicy" may get tossed around carelessly. I once even had a cheese filled hot dog, with relish of course. Note my sarcasm.   I look forward to reading this (asuming you actually write this), please do be so kind as to drop me a note when this is done. Sarcasme noted.   All my best intentions really. I also wanted to add something about your entry on blog slang. You speak of using the correct english, but your spelling is lacking something to be desired. When you take a stand against something, make sure what you have on your side is strong enough to defend yourself. Thanks for inviting me to take the challenge. I would love to challege you to a "prove me wrong if you dare" and you most certainly can try. I do laugh when I read your entries and you very well may be a nice young man with a funny sense of humor...thats my point..prove me wrong   yes i speak of using correct English, i never said it has to be perfect. i only asked people to use english, not that internet slang (if you dont know what it is, dont even comment). Internet slang and proper English are 2 completely different things, i cant even understand how you can compare the 2.  yes i know my spelling and grammer suck, wich isnt all to bad since English is not my maiden language. I dare you to write propper Dutch, see what happens.  Thank you for laughing. people need to laugh more these days. -Love
