Summer break is almost here for one. Only one day (according to my mathematical skills, half day + half day = one full day) is left till the big break. Ah, can't wait. It'll give me the time I need to work on projects that I've put off during the school year (my under-updated webcomic and my big fiction story). Knowing me, I'll probably end up starting a few other things as well.  Today was pretty cool though. Seeing as it's the end of the school year, there wasn't much really productive going on. Geometry was studying for the final exam, Spanish was doing some quiz thingy, Gym was sitting, and Global Village was more sitting. Ohhh, I got to play Oregon Trail on the crumby school Macs with Chris in Global Village though. That was pretty cool. I caught typhoid fever and died. :) And I swear to god our guns shot cannon balls.  Anyhow, I should probably be studying for my Geometry and Spanish finals. They  are  tomorrow after all.
