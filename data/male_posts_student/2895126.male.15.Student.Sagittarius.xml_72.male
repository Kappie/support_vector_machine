I was gone all last week at Duquesne University, for a stay-in-the-dorms summer campish thing my school does for freshman and sophomore years, designed tomake you hate Duquesne.(We got over the crappy dorms; it was great.) A typical day:     7:30 AM - 8:40 AM  Wake up and Breakfast at Duq. Union Cafeteria   8:40 AM - 8:55 AM  Morning Assembly; Prayer and Announcements   9:00 AM - 10:20 AM  Class 1   10:25 AM - 11:45 AM  Class 2   11:45 AM - 12:45 PM  Lunch at Duq. Union Cafeteria   12:45 PM - 2:05 PM  Class 3   2:10 PM - 3:30 PM  Class 4   3:35 PM - 5:00PM  "Elective:" Art, Drama, or Team Building   5:00 PM - 6:00 PM  Dinner at Duq. Union Cafeteria   6:00 PM - 7:00 PM  Free time   7:00 PM - 9:00 PM Activity: sports, etc.   9:00 PM - 11:00 PM  Dorms     (11:00 PM - about 3:00 AM)  Fool around    That last item was added my me, of course.    Anyway, as you can imagine, a week like this is going to either make you hate everyone or make you wish it'd never end. I thought our class did very well in this respect. While I've heard little horror stories about how everyone hates each other by the end of sophomore summer session from this year's juniors, we got along all right.    Way to go. (Eww... I was positive.)    I'll just pick out some events that were memorable, in no particular order.      "Open Discussion" in Brian's and Giuseppe's room... no comment as to what we (Stand, Stack, Staltari, Muchow, Hauser, etc.) talked about.  I like soup.  Mr. Bockstoce's birthday "surprise..." climaxing in an entire cake shoved into Rich Latusca's face and all over the wall.  Wildwood Highlands go-carts.  How only Hauser is worse than me at goofy golf.  Walking from Duquesne to the Point and back in Walking... and then two days later, 3 miles in 55 minutes.  Good Ol' Options cafeteria (vomits).  Me and my bagpipes :) .  For a definitive guide, contact Helena Erdeljac, who has a complete journal of her experiences. I wasn't this... uh, conscientious, but she certainly was.   Well, that's really all I feel like Blogging right now, except for a statement I'd like to make about how certain things depress me.  I have a little nostalgia problem. Whenever something fun or really memorable happens, I get all sad about it. Like this week, I knew that our class would never be that close again. And when I think back to the class of '04's senior movie thing, even though I wasn't in that class, it made me sad. All these great things, and they all fade away!   I guess I just have a fear of change. I just need to accept that things move on and then just go. *Sigh.*  But on a happier note, I'm free this week and then I get to go the beach! I'll blog about that too.
