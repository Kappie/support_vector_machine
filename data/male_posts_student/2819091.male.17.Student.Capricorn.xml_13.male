Clueless as that girl I know, Then again I didn't even let it show. Now, I'm blank... No longer thinking, No longer paying attention. Always in a daze, Feeling like I'm in a maze. So confused, My mind has been abused For such a long time. I need rest... Yes, that's what I need... A long rest, relaxation... Give my mind bliss... Bliss.
