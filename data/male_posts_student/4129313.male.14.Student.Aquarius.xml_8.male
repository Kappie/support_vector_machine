That would be a sight to see. As usual, I'm gonna post a recap of today. So here goes.  First period was realy wet from saturdays rain, everything on the walls were destroyed when we came back from the weekend. It's a realy old portable, so it's to be expected. It's just a shame the girl to my right wasn't the one who was wet ;)  Second period I read and finished my book. (Gathering Blue) I almost wanted to yell out "HOLY SHIT" when I read that Kira's father was still alive, and had found his way back to Kira through Mat. Very great book, it's a shame though that it was only a couple hundred pages long. I started to read the next book I have (The Messanger) but after a page or two, the bell rang (or should I say "Buzzer sounded" lol). Both books are a continuation of another book that I liked alot called "The Giver," or so I heard.  Third period was the usual math, corecting the test from friday, and begining on our homework.  Fourth period I was forced to move to the back of the room because like 80% of the class had an F in either academic, citizenship, or both. I was one of the very few who had an A, so I can sit anywhere I want, as long as it isn't in the front where the trouble studen'ts are assined. So I have a choice of 10 seats, but only if I get there before everyone else. I don't know why these idiots even come to school if they aren't going to do anything and earn a grade.  Fifth period somebody stole a ball that we were gonna use as a puck for a game of court hockey. I can't belive someone would steal a BALL! I MEAN ITS A FUCKING BALL!!! WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU STEAL A BALL? I mean seriously, if I wanted a ball, I would go out and buy a new and better one for probably $1.50 at the most. Again, I say, why do these idiots even come to school? It was hot and the coach made us walk the track untill either the bell rang, or someone had found/returned the ball. This is rediculous.  At lunch today the salad lady already had my salad ready for me lol. She knows exactly what I want each day. 1 salad with everything on it, turkey, roll, and ranch. I don't know what it is about them salad's, I just like them so much. I needed a reason to eat more greens anyway ;)  Sixth period the teacher's son came into the class and Mr. W had him stand up at the front of the class so we can all ask him the new german questions we just learned, and his son would answer in german. I didn't make the connection between Mr. W and his son for like 10 minuts, and then I realized "Hay, doesn't Mr. W have a kid with the name Colin?" Talk about your major blonde moment lol.  My front tire was flat yet again, so I had to walk all the way to 7/11, then go in and hope my bike wasn't stolen while I ask to have the tire pump activated, then I had to walk back to my bike, push the button to turn it on, put the tube back into the tire, then put the tire back onto the rim, pump it up, and hope that it doesn't explode or stay flat. Then I have to ride home realy fast so that the tire doesn't deflate while I am riding. I realy want some of those solid ruber, indestructable kind of tires. Them desert thornes realy get me too. The desert is realy not the best place to ride a bike.
