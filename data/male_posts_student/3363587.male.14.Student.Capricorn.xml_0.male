Combine in the music room, playing all the songs we were doing for the upcoming performance..."Ok, take out your Final Countdown" Oh the joy of hearing that! Hehez...Final Countdown is my personal favourite...especially with myself at the drumset. He started, went around four bars into the song, and then stopped. "Ok, Final Countdown so easy, I don't think you all need to practice. Take out your Washington Post." KAOZ! I was havin so much fun (although it was only four bars) and he just stopped! Nevermind that. You should've seen the look on my face. =p  Number two for lost opportunities! The final part for the practice; the great competition repertoire! Only me and one of my juniors were on the snare drum then. He turned to face me and said..."Khairul, this is our big solo!" I nodded back, skillfully throwing my sticks into the air and catching them on the other side. "Let's do this!" The excitement was there...we were revved up and ready to go...  The fanfare began, and adrenaline rushed inside of me...and when it ended, it happened again! He stopped again...and said "Go to 197!" DUDE! THAT'S LIKE, THE END OF THE REPERTOIRE ALREADY! Oh well, gotta put up with it. Hope that doesn't happen again...=p Alright, I think I've said enough...
