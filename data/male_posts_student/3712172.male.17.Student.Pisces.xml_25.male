Today I began my journey to quit smoking :) I call it a journey because I have to journal my smoking for a week, and study the patterns of my smoking to attempt ways to cut down in certain situations. I have been prescribed Zyban, but I am not going to start it for another week or two. I want to take it nice and easy to make quitting as smooth as possible. I have come to the conclusion that I want to want to quit, and I believe that my mentality and state of mind will grant me willpower to do so. I just think positive; as in one day it'll pay off. I won't have to worry about the effects if I stop now, and I can have a more healthy and well-worth life. Smoking sucks, it kills, and it needs to stop for me.   today's journal goes as follows:   1) 10:13 AM    First Cigarette Of The Day    Routine  2) 10:54 AM    Bored - Waiting For My Ride To Work  3) 11:14 AM    Before Work Cigarette    Smoking Before I start Work Helps Me To Last Until Break  4) 1:35 PM    Break Cigarette    "Stress" Relief From Work    Routine  5) 4:01 PM    Break Cigarette    "Stress" Relief - Filling The Need To A Craving    Routine  6) 4:22 PM    After Eating Cigarette    After Eating, Food Gives Me A Craving For A Cigarette.    Helps "Wash" Down The Meal.     Routine      7) 6:03 PM    Break Cigarette    Filling The Need For A Craving  8) 8:06 PM    After Work Smoke    After A Long Day At Work, Relax, A Nice Cigarette To Calm Me    Routine  9) 8:26 PM    After Eating Smoke    Routine  10) 8:57 PM     At The Computer Cigarette     Bored, Had A Craving.  11) 11:33 PM     Sitting At Computer     Had A Craving     Did Some Work From 9-10:30   So I am down to just under half a pack. Not too bad. I really tried to limit myself today, and work aided me in that, which is rather good.   I plan to cut down a bit more each few days... I want to work myself down to about 8-10 a day, then I plan to start taking the pill which will help me decrease my cigarettes per day even more. I have it all planned out and I hope for the best :)  Other than that I went back to work today, my holidays are now over, so they have booked me right steady from now on. I will be raking in 80 hour checks though so I will be getting in the 700s every two weeks. Life is sweet :)  I hope to have some money saved for a car since I get my G2 October 25th. I have two more driving lessons then I go for my road test. I am pretty excited about that!  Moving is going smoothly, we are pretty much there. All of my stuff is mostly unpacked and what not now so I don't have too much else to do. I did have a lot accomplished these last two weeks so I feel really good I was able to do a lot and not feel so rushed.   I have to admit, I feel much more stable in my mind than I have been recently, and I am sure that the next few weeks will only get better. Positive outlooks and attitude begin to set in. I suppose I won't be writing such morbid and bashful poetry, it would be nice for a change :)  Speaking of poetry, my poem  urlLink "Assurance"  was selected for publication by Voicenets. I had entered it in at the beginning of July and heard back from them the other day. I have yet to send them my permission slip to publish it. I also ordered to book as I would like to own what my poem is being published in :) That inspired me a lot to keep writing as I have seen many poems of people I know rejected by them. I guess they enjoyed that one :)  I suppose I should get going, this post is fairly long but I need to compensate for the past few days I have slacked off in blogging :) Talk to you all later.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Good night.
