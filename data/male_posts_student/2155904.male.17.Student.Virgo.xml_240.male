It wasn't that bad though.  It's only sleep.  He went and got his stitches out.  The dentist had a pretty hard time getting the first set out but after a lot of persistence, and some pinching of Tyke's gums, he finally got them out.  Then he got the other 3 easily.  There was some bleeding for about 15 minutes afterwards but that stopped and now Tyke's mouth is hopefully like it will be for the rest of his life.  That's a bit of a weird thought.  No more change in Tyke's mouth for like 70 years.  Well, maybe he won't have all his teeth then, but hopefully.  After the removal of sutures, Tyke sat in the van and listened to music as his mom was getting a teeth cleaning at the same time.  Then they went to Starbucks and Tyke got his fav drink and then they went to Linens'n'Things for some dorm shopping.  Tyke got his comforter and bed sheets for his bed at The Washington State University this fall, or as Tyke is now going to call it TWSU or TWazzu.  Then Tyke went home and took it easy for a little while.  K-caj called him up and he came over for about 40 minutes.  They played shithead and 13/Big 2(why Big 2?).  It was pretty fun.  A nice break from the normal daytime routine.  Then Tyke played some piano (Pachelbel's Canon in D to be more specific).  That is just a splendid (second time usage today) song when played on the piano, especially when it is in person.  Tyke also laid out in the sun for a little while and it felt pretty good.  Then he just watched a little Family Guy.  At night Tyke had an enchilada for dinner and then fruit snacks and Nature Valley bars.  It feels pretty good now when Tyke eats now that the stitches are gone.  It does make a difference.  The areas that were cut open are still a little tender but they don't hurt or make that weird feeling when you bite aluminum foil on a filling anymore.  So that's good.  Then Kinker called Tyke (on his house phone which is funny cuz earlier in the day Tyke told K-caj how he hasn't gotten a call on his home phone in a while since it is usually just Macaroon who ever calls the house) and they set up a get-together at Kinker's house.  Tyke went there and K-caj and his friend were already there.  They played some shithead and 13 before heading up to Skippy's old neighborhood to his old neighbor's house for some poker.  Tyke knew exactly where he was going and actually knew the kid too.  They used to play baseball together back in AAA when Kinker was on the same team as well.  That was when Tyke got Nate McMillan's autograph on his baseball hat before a game down at Lakemont Park.  That was a good day.  But there were a couple of other guys playing too.  It was a good day for Tyke it turned out.  He picked a good seat indeed.  He won some early hands and then got chipped away but he was consistently either chip leader or in the top two or three.  He ended up winning like 37 or so meaning he gained a total of 27 with the 10 dollar buy-ins.  It was a good, fun night as Tyke caught some nice cards.  Not nearly as much as K-caj's friend though.  He got like 4 or 5 full houses and caught at least one on the river.  It was freaky.  Tyke got talked to a bunch by the father of the house because he was friendly and remembered Tyke and liked him and of course liked Tyke's dad.  Every baseball coach has liked Tyke's dad it seems.  After collecting his winnings and saying goodbye, Tyke drove Kinker home and then came home himself.  No real plans tomorrow but Tyke would like to go bowling at Hillcrest Bowl cuz Tyke believes it is Quartermania meaning it only costs 25 cents a game from 9-12.  That's definitely a good thing.  But last time Tyke couldn't get anybody who wanted to come so it fizzled.  Tyke already tried with his go-to girl but she is busy so he'll have to expand out his search.  But bowling is wicked fun.  Don't worry though, Tyke probably won't get another 205...or will he???
