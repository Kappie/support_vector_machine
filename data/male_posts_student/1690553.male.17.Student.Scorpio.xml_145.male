And this afternoon, I really wish it is just a dream.  A shocking news came after Friday prayer. My younger sister informed me that one of my fellow schoolmate had passed away. Amirul Azwan of 5SB. The news made me down for almost the whole afternoon. This.... is another painful reminder that we must make the best of our chance  oppurtunity. Also another bitter reminder to be careful on the road. Last year, one of the junior passed away because of accident too.  Too bad I was informed late, the funeral took place before Friday prayer.  urlLink Azleen  did attend the funeral. Insya'Allah, I'll pay his family a visit tomorrow.  Al-Fatihah...    The late Amirul Azwan is the one wearing blue cap.  - Sound of  Kau Sahabat Kau Teman  by  Hijjaz  -
