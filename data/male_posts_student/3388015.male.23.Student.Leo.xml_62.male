Some of you know I have a 2nd job I work in my free time, completely related to the LAS website.  I've been writing a program for them to update the site completely.  Well, I am finally done with it for now.  It only took 8 months.  The next part will be another several month project and the third part is going to be a doozy.  http://www.rochester.edu/College/LAS/new_website  It's not live yet so nothing is correct.  All the coding is done and there is a lot of back end hidden menus for them to modify stuff.  Everything is customizable.  It feels good, every project I do I expand my abilities.  I could sell the coding I did here and make several thousand dollars.  Anyway, I went to a meeting to present it, and this is the 4th week in a row that we've been unable to have a meeting because they keep telling me Vicki is busy.  Well, at least I get paid to sit there. :)  I went to the multimedia center to get a couple DVDs for the weekend and I grabbed four thinking maybe during the summer they let people have more than two.  "How many can I get out?" Me "Two." Guy "Even in the Summer? For staff members?" Me "The students bought these movies.  You get two." Guy "I know who bought them, I went here for four years." Me  Suffice to say, what the hell was his problem?  He was olden than me.  And apparently nobody told him that Mr. Dowd pitched in a big chunk of money from the library fund to buy half the collection too.  So I have two movies for the weekend.  I used to own both of them before they were stolen, so I'm going to see if I can make a copy of them onto a blank DVD+R and if that works, I'll keep doing that.  I also signed up to the Walmart DVD renting club. It's free for 30 days, so I'll see if I like it.
