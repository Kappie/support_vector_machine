We are gonna actually make the movie for fun.  Right now, Matt Guibord, Nick Kehn and I are working on a rough script.  There will probably be alot of people involved in this little project which will probably turn out as a Comedy Horror movie, if you have any ideas feel free to post, as long as they arent negative.
