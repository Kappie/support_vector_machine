Second period I got the results from the reading test I took a few days before. The test was basicly made to tell you your reading level so if it was 4th to fifth grade level, it would say 4.x-5.x and the teacher wants the students to improve their reading level abit. I scored within 11.5-12.9+ (the test only went to 12.9+) It's no suprise though, I have always loved to read. I read  Gathering Blue  the rest of the period. I'm only in this class because I had a history of fighting in previous schools, and they thought it was due to my bipoler, so they put me on an IEP with all the "Special Students."  3rd period wasn't much either, all basic algebra. 4th period was crap as usual, everybody talking to everybody else, and people thinking its cool if they can laugh the loudest. I realy hate how these kids act so young, it's scary actualy to know that one of these kids might end up to be the president of the United States one day. 5th period, PE coach let us off easy, we were going to walk the perimiter, but being as hot as it was, we went into the gym and played/watched others play volleyball. Lunch I had another salad, with turkey and ranch. 6th period we composed some basic phrases in german, not much realy when you think about it.  My tire was flat again, so I had to walk my bike to the 7/11, and pump it up again. On the way home I had a major chest pain, went from my right chest and down, it hurt alot, so if it continues I think I'll have to go see a doctor.  I downloaded SP2 for XP today, not much of a difference. I realy need to learn linux sometime.  Thats all for now, sorry if I'm at all boring, just blame the surroundings lol.
