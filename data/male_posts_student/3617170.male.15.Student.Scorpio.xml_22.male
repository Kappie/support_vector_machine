You're not going to change anybodies minds, and they're not going to change yours, you're just going to aggravate yourself. What's the point? It's sort of like trying to convince a toaster it's a lamp shade. It just...doesn't work.  24-hour news channels piss me off for the same reason. It's not the news anymore, it's people's opinions, and I don't give a crap what these people think. Just give me the news, and let me decide for myself.
