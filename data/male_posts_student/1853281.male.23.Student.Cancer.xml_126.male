Have not seen her and J.J. in years. It was a total trip. Yesterday, went to Aunt Elke's house and planted with mum 15 Lilacs, 3 box, 2 barberry, 1 variegated dogwood and some bee balm, siberian irs, and cornflowers for her garden. I am sore today, the arthritis is so not liking the damp weather. Picked some greens yesterday at the garden as well. Just had a salad of them. Home grown, organic lettuce, mizuna, and arugula. I love gardening:)
