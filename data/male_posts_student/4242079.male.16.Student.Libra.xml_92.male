The clutch is gone, which means I have to drive the loser cruiser (mini-van with wood panels) until I remedy this situation by either buying a new car, or fixing this one, neither of which I can really afford.   So. following suit with mark, I am now "whoring my self out for money if any of you would like my services email as well ;)"
