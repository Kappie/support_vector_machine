First off, let's see the new mutterings this week.    Exchange:: Gifts  Parental Advisory:: Suggested  Blowout:: Ghost Busters ( * )   Spider:: Arachnid  Happy:: Sad  Intense:: esnetnI  Corrupt:: Not Corrupt  Got:: Not  Crude:: Bad  Three:: Wise Men (Yea, Christmas spirited, I know)     * We have a Haloween alternative called the  Ghost Busting Blowout ; that's the only reason I thought of that.  Anyways, today was cool. Our little group of friends exchanged gifts, and to my surprise I got stuff. I kind of feel bad for not getting anybody anything, I just usually don't get anything and don't expect anything in return. Anyways, I got a little Mario 1-UP bracelet from Nick. Sasha gave me a Star Wars Lego set with Jaba's palace. Samantha got me a two liter bottle of Mountain Dew (YESH!) and a Donkey Kong stuffed animal. Dominique and I are exchanging gifts tomorrow. I will tell you what I get tomorrow (as well as what I got her *laughs*). Anyways, thanks to the person who read all of this. For that I will reward you handsomely. You can be the first to comment on this post. Talk to you all later.   You are the weakest link, goodbye.
