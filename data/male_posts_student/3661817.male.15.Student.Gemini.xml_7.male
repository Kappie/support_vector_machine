I was phyched...bad news.... i cant pick it up until around thursday becasue paretns work(ed) late today and tommorow.  Once my mom got home, i went out and ate dinner. Then, i went to the movies with some of my friends. Dodgeball, one funny ass movie. I'd recommend it to anyone. It was so funny. The whole cast was hilarious. Not only was the movie funny, but the girl sitting next to me (kate) laughed nonstop, which made me laugh, and most likely the rest of the group too.  We went to Applebees afterwards (kate had left) I had an awesome meal.  My AWESOME MEAL! 1. A Cup Of Soda 2. A French Frie 3. A Stolen Mozerella Stick (Sorry nicole)  I had to leave before the rest of the guys, but when i came home my mom showed me this printer she bought for the digital camera. Its pretty cool, it prints.... photos, like from the store and what not. Then i watche dsome tv, washed up, and posted this.  All in all it was a good day. I sense tommorow to be a boring one.  Until Next Time.
