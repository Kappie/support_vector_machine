I guess I'll just continue as if I don't care!  :D  Well today was pretty boring.  Fire drill or something.  Apparently they don't know how to work the system.  Went outside for maybe 30 seconds and then everyone back inside.  Fun.  It was supposed to be really cold today, and it was in the morning like always, but midday it was warm.  I hope it stays warmer... like I've said.  Winter sucks.  The only upside is the snowmen... but even those get boring.  Shrug..  Chemistry test today... I think I did alright.  Really wasn't too hard.  Only like 2 or 3 questions I didn't know.  I think I got at LEAST a C.  Probably a B.  Ownage.
