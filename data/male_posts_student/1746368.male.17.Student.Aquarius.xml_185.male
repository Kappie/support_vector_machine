(reminds me of when she and I first started going out; we worked together a lot then too) When I got home from church the Jennings and I went over to 7-11 to get some M-Dew. Yum!   We went over to their house and they taught me how to play Stratego. It's pretty cool and if any of you guys have played it, you know what I mean!   Well, that's all! Talk to you all later!
