So, JR do you have anything to say about that?  For a while, life is great to you. It does pretty much everything that you want it to do. Then, it screws you over! All of your hard work is just thrown down into the toilet. It's like crap, isn't that why people say "Oh, shit!" they must be referring to their life! Ok, maybe that was really corny (in fact, it was!), but there are some good things about life.     DISCLAIMER  : this blog is merely for comical purposes. That is all.
