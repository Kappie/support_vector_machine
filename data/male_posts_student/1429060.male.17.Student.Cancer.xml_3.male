In accordance to the weather channel, the ozone layer is currently disintegrating like styrofoam. They state:  A CODE ORANGE HEALTH ADVISIRY IS IN EFFECT.   This translates as, "the ultraviolet rays that are seeping through the atmosphere are so damn intense that they can fry you like batter if you step outside for a long time." Fun time if you like skin cancer. I personally don't find the idea appealing. I am genetically inclined to that kind of stuff (cancer, etc.).  Can you say diesel fuel byproducts and artificial refrigerants? That spells CO, CO-2 and CFC.  I am not happy with the environmental situation. They really need to roll out the new hydrogen cars.  Cheers, humans.
