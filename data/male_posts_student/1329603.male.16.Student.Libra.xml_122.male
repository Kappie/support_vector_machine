Although I have struck a resounding problem by my inability to make conversation with  anyone  at CAYO, which is a further testament to the fact that my sociability leaves a little to be desired. Despite this, I am feeling at peace. Not happy, not unhappy. Just... at peace.  My Grade 8 is now 25 days away. I have 25 days of practice left until what is the end of my youth as a trombonist. Post-Grade 8 is when you learn to be a master of the instrument, learning Alto Clef, joining the National Youth Orchestra (NYO), learning to lip-trill... this is my life after GCSE. However content I may be, the question still springs to mind whether I will continue to be alone during this period of my life. I feel this a question only time will answer. Which is a pain, time has never given me a straight answer in the past, I see no reason for it to do so now.  I'm sorry, everyone, I know I'm being a bit whiny at the moment and not particularly fun (if I was ever so in the first place!). I'm in an odd place in my life. I'm confused, very nervous, and very busy. The questions running through my head are ones that need answers, and ones that will have no answer. I want to help people, to know them, but at the moment I can't get close enough to anyone to be of any service. I have to ask that you don't take me too seriously. I don't want to worry anyone.
