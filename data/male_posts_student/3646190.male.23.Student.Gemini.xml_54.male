Obviously I am not narrowing down the relationship just to a political experience, but it tested my perspective on life, it taught me how to be happy, and how to experience sadness. It showed me the depths of myself and another human being... The reality is (I believe) that the experience I had can help others understand patriarchy, themselves, Islam, and the Desi community. I am not saying it will change people's lives, but at least it will help them see some things clearer depending on each person's understanding of what I have written. That is why I am not worried about sharing my most private thoughts online at this point. I have decided that after my pamphlet is completed, I will post that on this blog and stop blogging. I feel that this specific journey will come to an end at that point. So August 31st is the approximate deadline....
