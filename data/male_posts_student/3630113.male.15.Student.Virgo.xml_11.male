Traipsed to auditorium at 9...was supposed to "enjoy" the different cultural dances and "enrich" ourself...i must say the westspring ppl really came well-prepared(for those of you who are unaware...the whole of westspring secondary school was invited to our school in joint celebration of racial harmony..in an bid to help chinese high students understand more bout other cultures..i think..hah.) they performed really well...the chinese high guys who were supposed to collaborate and perform together were the worse performers...seriously...it was utterly embarassing...crap man...i think even william hung would have laughed at 'em. wth man...it was an utter disgrace...tsk tsk...it was a really lackadaisical performance...zzz...  most of us made our way to kah kee hall to check out the sepak takraw ppl...woah...the malays are really skilful...lol..we almost "koped" a sepak takraw ball cuz my own ball was falling out of favour with me.hah. i want a new ball anyway...(sepak takraw that is)  went to play basketball...since we were so bloody bored...wah...in jeans and polo tee...but luckily the weather was quite favourable..it rained in the early morning so it was pretty cooling playing during then..the floor wasn't exactly wet as well...played about 2 hours of bball...wah...crap man..i forgot to clear 2 times...and during the 2 times i shot the basketball and it went in with a "swish"..other than that i wasn't able to achieve success...until when we were about to leave the basketball court..i just randomly shot a three-pointer and it went in through the hoop in sublime style...Zzzzz....  went street court watch ppl play for a while..the usual patronisers of street court were really good...it was an amazing display of football..really cool...den went to watch "remember the titans" in auditorium...woah..it's a really cool movie..denzel washington movie once again...he's really one heck of an actor...the little gal in the movie was fantastic as well...she was damn cute...lol...really mature...in a good way...haha...kinda tomboyish...but she's really charismatic and perpetually seeks fairness...hah...i think it's a really good movie...no doubt one of the best i've enjoyed...the story's bout this afro-american(denzel washington) employed to coach this football team...cuz all of the whites were prevalent in the american football teams...so it caused lotsa dissent...but eventually he brought them together as a team...they did really really well...haha...a perfect season..that's really cool siaz...  geog test after that was quite easy..i think...lol...cuz i was really famished so i guess i didn't really care...i was really craving for some food...zzz...so i just rushed through it..den went kap macs with vin, jon, pzh, low kee guan, shixian, bk, ying quan and wei zhi joined in later..lol...it was hilarious...eating with pzh...lol. wah...seriously...it was most fortunate that we weren't wearing school uniform...lol...we really turned the place around..literally. lol...it was damn funny...now jonny has a new nick..instead of being stinky..he's become zebra. lol.  wah...suddenly we started playing zong ji mi ma...lol..it was damn funny...they started preparing the forfeit...an interesting concoction...mixture of mayonnaise, lettuce, sweet chili sauce, sweet  sour, curry, coke, milo, and a pickle.lol. wah...i heard it tasted really vile. lol. vincent was really really "fortuitious" hah...he tio the number 4 times! sothe forfeit was that the person had to dip a french fry into the sauce andconsume it...lol..it was damn funny...luckily i didn't tio...wah jonny was quite dumb...zheng hui just anyhow said...aiya...i choose number...to verify he smsed the number to shixian...den he said jonny u start...and since the range was 1 to 500...jonny chose the median number...lol..and tio! hahahaha....that's quite dumb..hehehe..finally we decided that it was gonna be the last time since it was kinda late.so we changed the forfeit. wei zhi tio! hah! he was among the bunch ofmost unlikely targets! lol. so we proposed 3 options: a) pick a leaf from the tree and consume that leaf, b) stand on the table and sing a song, c) go get a gal's number...wahahaha...vin proposed an alternative...all of the above...lol. so did i...i said that he could pass on all the responsibility to one person...the condition was that the person had to be jonny...lol..but eventually weizhididn't shirk responsibility la...not like some ppl...lol...he went up at first...wanted to get the ny gal's number...but didn't dare...lol...but after a matter of time and prompting...he did it..he asked for the number when her companion had returned. lol...think the gal was quite nice-looking la...lol..budden she sabo-ed her friend and gave her friend's number...lol...oh well...we left after that...haha..it was hilarious sia...  i heard ying quan called the gal when they were on the bus...lol...the gal(she's called lisa i think..lol...all "lisa"s from ny please be wary...)lol..and her mum picked up the phone..wahaha...den he hung up.lol. and wei zhi just told me...
