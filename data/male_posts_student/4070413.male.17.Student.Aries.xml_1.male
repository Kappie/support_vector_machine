Complacency limits yourself from improvement. Foolishness brings shame. Realistic bored your partner. Manliness shows no interested. Feminine shower with care n concern. maturity gains the fame. Childish bears the consequences. Love is special but isn't magnificent and lead you nowhere. Is there something call Everlasting? Neverending? Forever or even Eternity? I doubt. Prove everything to me. Everything will end after you met enough people.
