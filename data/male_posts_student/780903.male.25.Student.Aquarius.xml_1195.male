I'm living in way-far-from-Manhattan-and-an-hour-commute-each-way Brooklyn with my parents, and so I qualify for that.  So I was talking to my mom on my cell phone while in the car, and I mentioned something about a bunch of other summer associates mentioning to me tonight that they had seen my weblog, and after I hung up, the car driver starts a conversation with me.  I swear all of this is real.  I swear.  "You a summer associate?" "Yeah." "Good thing you don't work for [firm].  They find out someone has something like a weblog, they fire you instantly.  Not tomorrow, not next week, today." "Oh." "But the firm you should really go work for is [other firm].  Nicest people in New York.  We drive for all of the firms.  [Your firm] is fine, but [other firm] is the best.  Everyone is very polite, very nice to each other, and don't just get in the car and start yelling at people over their phones.  You should work for [other firm].  Very liberal.  Very nice people." "Oh." "What kind of law you want to do?" "[kind of law]" "Oh.  Yes.  [Other firm] is great at that.  Do you know [partner at other firm who by coincidence happened to be one of the people at that firm who interviewed me]?" "Yeah.  Big guy, right?" "Yes.  And one of the best lawyers in New York.  You want to do [kind of law], [other firm] is where you should be.  [This partner]'s wife, a very old woman, is so bossy.  They were late to a hockey game, and she goes on and on and on.  But he is a very nice man.  [Other firm] is really a great firm.  Very good." "Oh."  He should be a recruiter for [other firm].  Really.
