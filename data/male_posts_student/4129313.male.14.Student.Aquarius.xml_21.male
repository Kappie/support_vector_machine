It was funney watching how the others reacted to him, they were throwing begal's at him to get him to go away. I finaly wisteled for him to come over to me and led him to the front office to let them deal with him. Not much homework in my math class today, I finished 30 out of 36 in class already. I was able to run the entire track in just 3 minutes today, wich is a great accomplishment for me because I usualy do it in 9. I'v never been a good runner. I had a salad with everything and turkey again today, this time with crackers instead of a role, BIG mistake. I managed to memorize the first stanza of the poem, but I had to repeat it all day long just to remember it.     THE ROAD NOT TAKEN  by Robert Frost  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-- I too the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.    Well, I only have to put up with her for the one year. I realy want to save up to buy a notebook, just so I can blog on the fly. I got 20 buck the other day from my best friends mom just for reformating her computer, but I dont think I can get much money out of fixing computers seeing as this whole town is so computer illiterate. I truely hate Apple Valley. I truely hate ANY desert.
