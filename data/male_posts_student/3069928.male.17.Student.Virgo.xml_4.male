The issue, which has incited heavy debate for the past year and half, was a touchy one between Democrats and Republicans within the Senate chamber. The Republicans, the ones pushing for the amendment, made it clear that this was no longer a state-oriented issue--that the specefics of the DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act--passed in the Senate in '96 with an 85-15 vote, and signed by President Clinton) were being challenged all around the nation because of lawsuits filed by gay couples who received marriage licenses outside of their home states. DOMA has been adopted by 40 states, which means those 40 states have the right to turn down and not recognize gay marriage licenses. Of course, activist judges say otherwise, declaring DOMA unconstitutional, in which states have to recognize those marriage licenses whether they want to or not.  Up step the Democrats to this fiery issue. While Republicans in the Senate chamber took their time to explain why such an amendment was neccessary, the Dems took their usual approach to the issue: avoid it, brush it aside, and change the subject. Throughout the entire three and half days of deliberation, only two Democratic senators actually addressed the issue: Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who made it clear he would only support an amendment if courts continue in their activist manners, and everyone's favorite liberal, Teddy Kennedy, who said he is outrightly against traditional marriage. All of the Democratic senators, most notably Dianne Feinstein (CA), Chris Dodd (CT), Barbara Boxer (CA), Frank Lautenberg (NJ), and Harry Reid (VT), among others, avoided the issue by saying the Republicans either a.) are full of hate and are trying to legislate their Nazi-esque agenda, or b.) are making this a national issue so they don't have to debate the economy or the current situation in Iraq.  I wrote a letter to one of my senators, Bill Nelson, a Democrat, who I thought would express the views of my state (predominantly Republican) rather well. I explained to him that his party needs to start addressing the issue, or they will simply lose trust among the 3/4 of Americans who are against gay marriage. Well, apparently he didn't listen to me--he voted against the amendment. And that's a problem when we have gays filing lawsuit in the Florida supreme court who want to be recognized as a married couple, even though this state has adopted DOMA unanimously through the state legislatures.  Well, to be honest, I find the performance of the Senate in their vote of 48-50 against the amendment rather disgusting. Here we are in the top level body of congress, debating whether or not we should protect an institution which has been the building block of this great society since day one--and we have Democrats saying we need to discuss a free-trade policy with the Australians? I'm sorry, but this issue isn't JUST about gays... it's about the American family. It's about the welfare of our culture and our children.  Gays are not bad people. I myself have an aunt who is a lesbian, and that has never at any time altered my opinion about her. I accept her as a person, however, that does not mean I condone her lifestyle. I am a Catholic, and I believe in accepting all--but I am not obligated to accept the way she lives... though make no mistake about it: she and every other gay person in America have the right to live their lives in absolutely any form or fashion they want. They have the right to pursue life, liberty, and happiness, as dictated by our Declaration. However, they DO NOT have the right to redefine a cultural, social and/or religious element as they see so fit to their needs.  It's like playing a board game and making the rules up as you go along. See, the gay community in this country has absolutely no qualms about bending, twisting, or altering laws and/or legal defintions  so long as it caters to their very own personal needs.  It would be like me as a Catholic going into a public school, and asking for the teacher to insert prayer time into the agenda so I could have my spiritual needs met--regardless of whether or not the class wanted to be subjected to it. Sorry, but no one should be able to do that. This is America, if the majority doesn't like it, then it's not going to fly.  I guarentee that if you go out and ask anyone between the ages of 13 and 30 what marriage means, they'll say something to the effect of "To affirm the love between two people." Well, I've got one word for that definition...  "Wrong."  Since when did marriage become some sort of social luxury for people who love eachother? It's not based all around pleasure... it's based around providing a safe, harmonious, and stable environment for a potential family. If two people get married, chances are, they're going to move into together if they haven't already... and what motivates them to do that? The marriage, of course. And studies have shown that to successfully raise a family with the highest potential, both a mother and father must be present, because each parent brings something different to the realm of rasing kids. I for one can vouch for this: I've learned things from my mother that I would have never learned from my father, and viceversa. My mother helped me out a lot with my schooling and social skills, while my father helped educate me on fixing things around the house--how to take care of things, so to speak. If I hadn't had both of them around, I have absolutely no clue what I would be like today. But I can assure you one thing--I would not nearly be as confident in myself if my father hadn't been around, and I wouldn't have been as academically determined if it weren't for my mother.  That's what makes me cringe when I hear "Marriage is all about love." Yes, I acknowledge, a component of marriage is love, but it is not the reason, nor the goal of it. If marriage were a car, "love" would be the fuel of that car, and the more love there is, the more efficiently a marriage functions. Marriage is about the 2 people who engage in it? How could anyone say that? Marriage is about  selflessness  not  selfishness.  Both parties are supposed to give as much as they can to one another, or the rest of the family, and the last priority should be themselves. A marriage is a lot like the concept of America: what you put into it is inevitably what you get out of it.  This is the prime reason this issue has sparked so much debate in the first place. We cannot allow, in any way, such a culturally concrete institution be jeopardized by dumbing down it's social significance. By allowing gays to marry, we simply shrug off marriage as another "thing." Well, according to Americans all around the country, marriage is not just a "thing," it's a serious issue which needs to be dealt with in an efficient manner, and according to the majority, must be protected, be it by local, state, or federal law.  I despise the notion that marriage is unimportant. It has been the most basic building block of society since ancient times, and to simply disregard and disrespect the impact it has made on civilizations, past and present, is what I call "social ignorance."  So until the federal legislatures decide they have time to concentrate on protecting the welfare of the American family, the lawsuits will continue, the activist judges will be free to legislate their agenda from the bench, and the Supreme Court will obtain many more steps towards declaring DOMA unconstitutional. And when they decide to confront the issue as they should have done yesterday, they will be forced to recognize that the majority of Americans  do not, and will not recognize marriage for gays.  And the only way to protect the people is with a constitutional amendment defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman... and nothing else.
