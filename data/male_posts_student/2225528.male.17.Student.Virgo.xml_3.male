I was supposed to meet up with my friends at the State library having said that my friend would pick me up.. as a result of his fucking stingy reluctant attitude of not wanting to pick me up, he ended up at ANOTHER library himself and deserted me after what I have gone through the whole morning before! Before the deserting incident from that fagg, I was ordered around doing this, doing that till I was pissed by EVERYTHING that happened.. adding to the deserted situation, that made me even more mad.. and ended up my plan B of going to the library has fled away.. ArGH..!! then I had a stupid engagement dinner to attend.. Ugh! it was AGAIN another misfortunate incident for me.. turns out I was invited there last minute as I was forced to be the substitute of one of the "absent" guest, hmmph.. that (arrogant brat).. what pisses me off is the fact that I dun have a proper attire to attend that stupid dinner as my clothes are all at my home..! Ended up wearing a stupid 3 quarter jean pants with a red T shirt and a sandal.. *tears*.. TO MAKE THINGS WORST, during the dinner, I had to accompany my uncle everywhere.. I mean EVERYWHERE! Having said that I had no proper clothes, I had to "bodyguard" the man around the hall to mingle to his old mates in accordance to the showing of my sleezy, lame, cheap, and IMproper clothes.. to make things even MORE worst, a stupid cameraman and his assistant flashed a bloody huge bright light my table directing AT me taking "memorable moments", debuting my first On Screen showing of my pathetic attire which also marks the end of my social string BIG TIME! -_-" God...! Give Me Strength..This time, I MEAN IT..! Ugh.. I'm so fucked up now.. tell me what should I do to get rid of these negative "Aura"s?? Feng Shui? Star Signs? Prayers? -_-" I doubt it would work anyway *sigh*..   Anyway, starting school next monday morning after two weeks break from school..
