I have always thrived for what others wanted me to be, for what others thought would be better, but now I have finally come to the realization that the world is hell.  Trying to see the positive only brought more pain into my already tortured soul.  What positive is there to see? Love? Light? Hope?   What hope is there? Million's die every year by diseases, famine strikes the heart of every poor country, shakes and rattles the very foundation it was based upon to the ground, killing all whom live.  What else is there? Plague.    Plague will strike at any time, any day, whenever it sees fit, and will show no pity to whoever is in its path.  1665, what happened? The Great Plague stalked all of England, killing all whom it touched.  According to reports, over 100,000 people had died in pain by the year's end.  Does this seem like a world of hope and love to you?  This is but a minor plague compared to what happened in the 1300s.  One third of Europe's population was eliminated off the face of the earth that being 20 million helpless souls laid down to rest.  How can you possibly claim that this world consists of hope? Can you not realize that there is no hope for humanity?  Every year, new diseases are being introduced. Sars, The "Bird Flu", yet still relatively new, are very dangerous disease's that humanity has yet to be able to identify, and all are quick to judge another country, when the fault is obviously there own.
