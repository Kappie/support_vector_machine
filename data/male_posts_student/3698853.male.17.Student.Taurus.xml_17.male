But for some reason, I suddenly have this innate desire to be productive. Scary as it may seem. I guess, I don't mean seriously productive, nothing like work-a-mania, just, productivity. Laziness is so.... boring, and outdated. I sat around playing Monster Rancher Three from 1PM to 9PM today. I think I lost a pound or two in the process. To some extent it was interesting, but at some point, I felt my breathing become labored, just from sitting there. Anyways, somehow, I can't see myself doing nothing for so long. I know it will be difficult for me. If there is one thing that I am sure of about myself, it's that I'm one helluva good lazy ass. I want to get better. I want to look, feel, better than a pile of trash. I know currently, even my teachers agree, I look like hell walking in Monday morning after having procrastinated on some project or essay. It's not that I like it, just that's what I've grown accustomed to. Last semester though, after having pushed like the Dickens and a woman experiencing labor to pull my grades up, my body quit at the very end, kinda like my 400m. My body had never done that before, and it scared me. Even before then, I couldn't stay awake past 11PM maybe even earlier. No, I didn't like that. So how to start? First, get organized. Perhaps, follow in suit of Diana's footsteps (Maybe not to her degree of neatness, though o_O, that's more like obessession). When I think back on all that time, that youth, wasted... I guess I just don't have that innate, or perhaps environmental influence even, ability to focus. I've seen those with a keen control over their concentration, and it has served them well. I think I have the capacity for that kind of focus. I've seen myself demonstrate it before, albeit, in insignificant and irrelevant situations (i.e., video games, weddings, etc.). The writing of this blog entry... is not one of those times (XP). Usually, when I write these, the lengthy ones, I tend to get distracted and have to try and remember what it was I was writing about, and, as you may have noticed, I skip around from topic to topic quite often. Ack! Distracted again. I guess that's all for that topic; I've burned it out enough, plus, now I'm biding space until I can think of about what to write in the next paragraph. _Lately, I've been reading a ton of webcomics. Sometimes, when there's a slowdown in the comics I'm currently reading, I start feeling the itch, and I just google and web directory until I find ones I like. I guess, it's because of them, other writers and artists, that I want to be like them. Because I enjoy reading their stories and looking at their art. And when I have all these things stored in my head. Just... people, places, happenings, designs, stories. I feel like writing them down or expressing them any way I can. Not for anyone else (as many of my friends know XP), just for myself. _If you were wondering what the hell the misguided thoughts part has to do with anything in my title. I realized, it just is that I envisioned this pied piper in my head, leading my thoughts off a cliff like lemmings, and sometimes, they wind up in the gutter, or just so brutally mangled, that they're almost not worth sharing. Anyways, that's the story behind that. It wasn't any kind of poetic or artsy thing. When I read the title a while ago, I realized it might come off as something of that nature, but nope, I'm not that deep so as to claim any title of artsiness. _Hmph. This blog entry seems to be lacking in any "straight line." Just kinda goes off into tangents. I wonder what exactly in my mind sparks that, the random surfacing thoughts. The same drive that generates my dreams I suppose. But usually, everything is non-sequitur and irrelated (real word? I don't know, but you get it, right? so that must make it a world, irregardless of Webster. and yes, "irregardless"  is  a real word) oh.... unrelated hahaha wow it's late. _Recently, too, I've seen a ton of Anime. not enough that I would be happy, but more than I'm used to during the school year. *Yawn* I really do want to write more, and probably could. In fact, were it not so late and I not so hungry, I would probably go back and delete a paragraph or two and redo them (XP). It's too late for that now though (so much for adjusting to regular diurnal cercadian rhythms XP). _Oh how I love biology. Not just being able to use words and pretend to look smart (although that can be fun too ;D), I enjoy biology for the sake of knowing how things, life, in particular works. Life is always such a mystery. Baffling and beautiful. Just how everything works out kinda like a symphony of coincidence and right timing. Like sometimes, I wonder at the odds that I ever came into existence or that slim chance life could have ceased to exist. That earth just happened to possess the right conditions at the right time to hold life. I know for a fact, that there are aliens out there. Perhaps, even more like ourselves than we know. Maybe, conditions on the planet have caused different evolutionary outcomes, but I doubt there is much difference. In this universe I can imagine plenty of life forms out there, at all stages, perhaps, unable to communicate with foreign planets. But I can imagine us, looking through our telescopes, not seeing them looking right back at us unknowingly, like that Rocky and Bullwinkle stuff. Anyways, i'd better head out for the night.
