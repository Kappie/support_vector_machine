I'm not about to lie and tell you that I don't have enough time because, hello, it's summer, but I just don't have anything to say.  You shouldn't miss me too much seeing as I don't say anything anyway.  I'd still love to journalcon with you guys though (yes, now it's a verb).  It's not you, it's me.  ;)  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!
