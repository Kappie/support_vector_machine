Well not much has happened except for the play and what not. i think it went well, i had a lot of fun at the after bashes. (the best was the after bash after bash on sat. night)  that's really about it. i'm not really sure. i keep on meaning to give terry a call... but man i'm so lazy. if she reads this she should call me, and if she doens't have my number then she should ask.  -mike
