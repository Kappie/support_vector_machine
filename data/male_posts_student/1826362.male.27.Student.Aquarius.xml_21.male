A crowd at Bowdoin is when three people gather together under a tree (i'ts in the student handbook). Today there was some sort of event on the main thouroughfair.  All these stupid stupid people in my way not moving anywhere, but looking at tables set up in the best possible location to impede the flow of foot traffic.  There was a bad band there too, with nobody listening.  I guess Camp Bo-Bo and TU are the same in that respect: nobodly likes a shitty band.
