I'll explain, I have this storm cloud hanging over my head and it's been here for months, but it hasn't rained.  It's only sitting there, and I hate it because I want to be rained on so the cloud can go away and I can finally see the sun again.  On the bright side Thomas gave me this RBG button with something about Anti-War and Reperations.  That's pretty funny.  Listening to "Thinking about Home" By The Delinquents.  So touching.  I really need to find a hobby that actually can keep my attention because my mind is just wandering around to much. I'm dabbling in all types of crap most people don't have time to bother with.
