We walked off the campus of our most prized high school using the awesome door in the orchestra room. And we drove to Kevin's house were we did the crappiest/dorkiest/dumbest/most enjoyable thing ever: We played scrabble. And had chocolate milk. And had stale tortilla chips.    Afterwards, we went to my house, Kevin made plans to go to a concert. The train would not come. We waited for about thirty minutes. And so I decided to go on an adventure of awesome proportions. (teehee). I decided to drive Charlotte and Kevin to Philadelphia so that Kevin could attend his concert. Note: it was my first time into Philadelphia.   Well, the trip went well. No hitches. It was easy, I'll say. And my two companions were treated to an enjoyable ride. Well, my rides are always enjoyable. Because I'm a fun driver. Although scary sometimes.    The Trip Pictures    And onward to the next section of Xanga Entry-ness. I shall copy both Lynne and Jemma and who ever else decided to do this. And I hope everyone else shall copy me. And so on and so forth.   Charlotte: You're a cool buddy. Although sometimes I can be moody/jerky I appreciate that you didn't totally run out or stop speaking to me. You're a good conversation. You're good advice. And you're someone that I feel that I can relate to and spill most of my beans too.   Kevin: You're pretty cool too. Although I didn't really start to talk to you until this year when we had that fateful 9th period together as well as those other classes together, I think that we get along pretty well. I like the conversations we have and the times we spent together. Most triumphant.   Jemma: You're someone I look up to. You have many good qualities that I say "Damn, I wish I had". You showed me the meaning of sarcasm, playful namecalling as well as the feel of tough skin. Go far. You will.   Lynne: I offically met you halfway through the school year. And at first when people were mentioning your name I had actually thought you as someone else with the same name. However, I soon discovered it was false. No matter, I think you're a pretty cool person too. I love to read your entries although most of the time, I don't have enough spunk to respond and comment. But no worries. Its good to meet someone with brains for once. You'll do well in your adventures.   Ben: You're an interesting thinker. And I like that. It was fun getting to know you this year. And I know next year is going to be greater.   Biscombe: I like your laughs. I like your "jokes" and stories. You're an awesome person. Although you really don't seem it, you're the smartest person I know. Well, the smartest person I would like to know. (Greg doesn't count because he's an ass). Anyway, it has been a swell year with you. Maybe during the summer, we could do something together. Or play scrabble online. I'll be looking forward to it.   Molly: How do warp engines work? Holodecks? I like our science conversations. Its awesome to know someone who can discuss nerdy/geeky stuff with. But thats not all you're known for. You're reasonable. You're hard working. I hope some of it rubs off on me. Especially the reasonable trait. :D   Becca: You're smart. But more importantly, you have common sense. I know many people several times your age in which I respect less. (you're still ten, right?) Keep up the good work.   Patty: You're the man. A great buddy as well as an awesome bash-thrower. Is there a more common sentence than "Party at Pat's tonight"? More than that, you're funny. Which goes well. And thus, may your life contain many parties as you work towards your goal.   I don't know anyone else. Well, maybe one more person. This person probably shaped this year the most for me. The most influencial. As much as I hate to admit it, my "voice of reason" (major eye-rollage). Although he will probably never read this (since I don't plan on giving him my Xanga address), I have to add him to the list of awesome people.   Matty: In quite possiblyeveryway possible, I love you. You're an asshole. You don't understand some of the stuff I put out. And I don't really understand the stuff you put out either. Sometimes I feel jealous of you. And I don't really believe why you would feel jealous of me. Your reasons for some stuff are quite "out-there" and totally disagreeable.   But you were there. You're a good conversationalist. You're always there to debunk an opinion and make me justify myself and my thinking, thus making me grow as a person. No longer am I the person with empty opinions. I have reasons for what I believe in. Thanks. Staying up late together and talking about whatever. I like the ultra-sappy mode you go into whenever you deem necessary, cheering me up.   I hate you. I hate you for going away. I hate you for something which I can't and won't hate you for. Its a mixed feeling sort of deal. Maybe its for the best. Maybe our friendship will be tested. I hope that our bond will never be broken. But if it is, I'll have the memories. I guess. But it won't come to that, I'm sure. We're going to see each other again when all this "college" business is over. And when we do, it will be good. We'll have ice cream. And go driving.   *sigh*.
