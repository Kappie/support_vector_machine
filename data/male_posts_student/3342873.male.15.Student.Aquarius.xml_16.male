"Live as though the world is as it should be to show it what it can be"  *Black_Lotus* yes  *ayjayess* do you have any idea how long it took the UN to respond ?  *Garson007* Black_Lotus :  Remember USA was going to attack Iraq, doesn't matter if UN gave thumbs up or not.   *ayjayess* do you have any idea of what the UN saw and yet the did nothing ?  *Black_Lotus* yes  *ayjayess* aye  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus : very nice quote  *Black_Lotus* ayjayess: but at least they intervened to a point. Look at Rwanda! Nobody did shit.  *Black_Lotus* here's my summary:  *Garson007* Arghhh if it does not concern the USA it gets vetoed  *ayjayess* YES!  *ayjayess* if the US can't profit, it doesn't matter anymore  *ayjayess* if the us isn't going to get hurt it is disregarded  *ayjayess* *US  *Garson007* USA has so much power in the UN...  *ayjayess* they basically fund the UN is so many ways  *ayjayess* The UN owes its power to the US to a certain extent  *Garson007* Plus they are part of the five. They can veto any decision  *ayjayess* yep  *ayjayess* like the race conference held by the UN in 2001 here in Cape Town...  *ayjayess* it wasn't held because the US decided it wasn't going to be a part of it  *Garson007* Russia, USA, UK. ETC is part of the five  *Black_Lotus* I understand that the world is a shithole at the moment and has been for some time. I know that the UN and NATO and Britain are all America's puppets and that they are too afraid to hurt the trade and global super power. But this shouldn't cause us to forget that there are rules and structure, right and wrong. I know that not all Americans are war supporters or killers, neither are all Muslims, Indians etc. If we forget our...  *ayjayess* look I do agree that society (the world) should strive towards a system that they abide by (rules) but to say that that system actually works in practice is ignorance  *Black_Lotus* ethics and morals and fail to question and debate then the world will turn into a real crap hole. You have seen the images of children with the soldiers in Iraq. There is a lot of good being done at this moment (Red Cross, UNICEF, Salvation Army etc.) but we forget all that because the news is riddled with violence, hate and lies.  *ayjayess* Black_Lotus  : good is being done, yes, but the motivation, that’s what we are trying to address isn't it ?
