Or buy me coffee.    Caught up with Troy Gilbert today, a friend from high school I hadn't seen in about five years.  Interesting how the time can go.  I still see guys like Daniel Young, Daniel Harr, Daryl Burrows on a regular basis, yet I haven't seen Bennett Ryel in about six years, or CJ Davis in seven.  When I was in high school, they were two different groups that I hung out with on a regular basis...in my mind Soccer and Band...at that time, had you told me to pick a group of friends that I would keep in touch with for the duration, it would be hard for me to have given one of them up.    The person to blame is Jeff Barker.  Jeff was the head soccer coach at Rogers High, and he was trying to revitalize a soccer program that was previously strong and well-organized.  His brainchild was to limit the JV squad to juniors and below, effective my senior year.  As a erstwhile starter on JV who only really challenged for a varsity spot my sophomore year, there was no soccer for me my senior year, nor was there for Bennett, Mike Moffat, Todd Slagle, Luke Macken...all the guys.  We still hung out, but there wasn't the everyday get out of class and head to Todd's house to get ready for soccer, fitting several matches of Super BomberMan in before we were through.    Looking back over the history of the two groups, it is impressive that I am as close to even one of them as I am.  Both left high school with a strong contingent of members purusing college outside of Fayetteville.  The soccer guys only had Heath Kuzack and Troy hanging on in F-town, while the band guys had about half stay.  Conway, Jonesboro, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, Springfield MO were all home to my old friends, and I was in Shreveport.  We were all growing apart, but for that freshman year, we kept in great touch through emails and visits when possible...because we had to find solidarity in our vagabond natures.    Two years later, I was still in Shreveport.  But Bennett had gone from OKC to Conway, and then gone with Mike and Todd up to Fayetteville.  Daniel Harr was in Fayetteville, soon to be joined by Jerromy Falk.  The groups had packed back together, and were stronger now than they were before.  The emails stopped with both...I had quit writing Revelations of Rolin at that point (a bad move at the time for communicative puporses, a good move now because I don't have to look back and remember my shit writing), and was loving my program, my girlfriend, and my life in Louisiana.  The rare times I got back to Arkansas, I would get in cahootz with whoever I could (which caused strife with the band folks)...but as the years passed, the only people whose numbers I continued to have, and thus continued to see, and thus continued to grow with, were the band guys, which was wonderful.  But I completely fell off with the soccer guys, once seeing them my junior year for an hour (in a spirit of awkwardness, I spent more time talking to girlfriends I never knew than I did talking to old friends), and two hours of hucking disk in 2001 after I had graduated, only because Nick Dorothy had left a message at Doug Muir's house for frisbee, which was also Daryl Burrows' house.    And then Austin, and poverty.  And there were Centenary friends to try to keep in touch with now too...and I had just spent four years with them, so they had precedence...and the band guys were all still there, and so the soccer team, to take a phrase from my debate years, didn't cross the river on the flow sheet.    So now I see Troy, who is looking great and doing great, living in a kitsch house with the most energetic of wives, and vaguely wonder about things that aren't worth wondering about.  A whole festoon of stories from my past glory are revisitable, lost in the annals of time when I couldn't tell them for audience lack of knowledge of said characters, back to the forefront.    Maybe it's not Jeff Barker's fault.  Maybe I just went a different way.  Maybe we were 19, and we sat in a car one night looking for something to do, and the laughter subsided, and for the first time in our history, that silence of enveloping awkwardness permeated the car, and the smiles faded, and the anxiety piqued, and we thought, in our sage 19 year old minds, "I don't know these people anymore."  And we smiled when we arrived where we were going, shook hands that moved into man hugs, said we'd visit the next time we were in town, and were back to our current daily grinds once the car was out of neutral.  And now, one BA and three years later, we realize we lost touch with some pretty rock people.    ---  I want to send a soft caress and love letter to "kisses," my email signatury since 1998.  When I took the line from Steve "Stump"  Moffatt in 1998, after thoroughly enjoying his ironic punk rock music reviews ending with sweet nothings, I didn't know if people would accept it.  But it was heralded, and soon kisses and I were nary to be away from each other.  By 2000, it was second hat to quickly peck out a "kisses" on the line before my name, so much so that it wasn't a swan song for the correspondance, but it was now part of my name, part of who I was.    The loss of kisses was sudden.  Howard Dean's campaign was in shambles after the media maliciously maligned an inspirational yell at the end of a speech to the point that it was foo-foo fodder for every comedian and electronica musician in America.  And the media's perpetuation of the speech as "unpresidential" was taxing...George Bush can snort coke, fuck the environment, and lie to his constituents and be presidential, but an impassioed man cannot show his exebuerence?    So I threw Eric Carmen's  All By Myself  on the radio, lit some candles, cried a lot, and resigned myself to my fate.  I wrapped it in a warm coat, nuzzled it close, and sent Howard Dean "kisses."  May he see the truth as hard as steel between the velvet lies of my monogram.    I miss it.  Words can grow to be like your children.  But children grow up and get girls pregnant.  And I received fair compensation in trade.    Have a good week everyone!  yeeargh! Rolin
