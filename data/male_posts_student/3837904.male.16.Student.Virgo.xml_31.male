I know myself that I've not done a wrong so big to harm one physically or emotionally. The out come seems with over joy. I'm hurt deep down and I found to be a waste. And I doubt a job well done on my N' level oral examination. Can I last this downpour? Will I be approach or will the silence just stay forever?
