I now have:  - Master and Commander (guy from Gladiator on a ship) - Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson as crazed spy. Has a funny scene with a shit tube. need I say more?) - The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (only first half, unless I can figure out why the 2nd half isnt working. still very good film etc) - Some more stuff I can't think of right now  So yeah, me happy. And the house seems a whole lot quieter now. I can actually hear myself think. And make it down the hallway without being run into by a hyperactive 6-year old with a deadly habit of trying to punch me 'below the belt'.  Oh, and study leave starts properly tomorrow. I'm going to get up early just so I can laugh at my sister having to go to school. Bwahahahahahaha.
