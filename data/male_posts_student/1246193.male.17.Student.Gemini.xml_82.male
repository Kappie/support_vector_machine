Not the slam the door in her face-light her clothes on fire kind of pissed, the "I'm tired and I really don't give a darn" kind of pissed. I know nobody out there cares but if you have a spare meat cleaver lying around...well, you know my number.   This will probably be the final blog for the next two weeks due to my absense from the country, so I am going to do my best to give you some things to think about while I am gone. Here we go:  1. I am going to be having a blast in England, France, and Switzerland while you are stuck in sunny Taylorville. I'm done; I just had to rub it in a little.  2. Someone needs to devise a plan for the eradication of a bird nest outside my window. I yell at the birds regularly but it doesn't seem to do any good. And since it is spring there are going to be some baby birdies chirping soon enough...at least somebody got some action.  3. Someone needs to devise a plan for the eradication of all stupid people that are everywhere. I yell at them regularly but it doesn't seem to do any good. And since most of them mate like wild rabbits there are going to be even more stupid people...to star in action films.  4. Don't ask me what the action films thing was about, I really don't know.  5. Elevators are really a lot of fun, unless someone farts while you are on it.  6. It is really a lot of fun to fart on elevators and watch people squirm.   7. Antiperspirant has mercury in it. That's right, the stuff they tell you to be careful with and don't touch-it's in the stuff that your underarms are absorbing. It is also linked to alzheimer's disease. I'm not saying that you should go around stinking, just use deodorant-not antiperspirant.   8. I really don't like it when people are in my house and they don't acknowledge me, simply because I'm not a person that they would normally talk to. You're in MY HOME! At least say hi and don't be an asshole.  9. I have nothing more to say...for now.
