I was walkin down Hix road and a car pulled up in an empty parking lot....no reason to really be there...it was like a school parking lot...so this guy gets out and is talkin to somebody thru the passenger side window...I pass them...and then the guy starts walking behind me...I turn off my headphones in case the guy is sneaking up on me trying to kidnap me or rape me or something...and there are these construction signs leaning against a pole on the corner of Hix and Ann Arbor Road...right next to my subdivision...I turn around and look and the guy is takin the stop sign...and I am wondering if this guy is from the construction...then suddenly this voice comes from my neighborhood across the street,  "HEY!! I ALREADY GOT YOUR LISCENCE PLATE NUMBER, YOU BETTER PUT THAT SIGN BACK BEFORE I CALL THE COPS!!"  The kid is stupid and drops the sign and takes off when the guy probably was lying about having his liscence plate cause it was practically pitch black and the car was across the street...the guy would need fuckin binoculars...so I just kept on walking....Now I am on a mission... I want that stop sign ...that kid was stupid trying to get it at 10 o clock when people are still awake...I am gonna go out at midnight...risk gettin caught by cops....and get that sign...and there is another one across the street close to my neighborhood...I'll probably get that one...but I want that stop sign...  In other news...and more importantly... I took a warm shower today!!   I am so happy to have everything back to normal with electricity and running water....well...I am hungry..and I might see Freddy vs. Jason with Mike and maybe one of his girlfriend's friends...I dunno why they hang out...i didn't hang with my girlfriend's friends...cause she would probably get suspicious and jealous...oh well....all that matters is that I am gonna see a movie today...  One more thing before I go...I am finding myself listening to the Clash alot and MUstard Plug...I know a weird mix...but I just started gettin into them...even tho i got their CDs a couple months ago...but thats what happens when you have too many CDs...  "I'm so bored with the U.S.A" -The Clash
