To absent companions, gentlemen. It's not often that something moves me enough to say this, but all my love to you, Alex. You'd have been 18 years old today. I would love to go watch the Blue Bombers with you and drink a molson down just like old times. I enjoyed our conversations a great deal. It's my foremost regret that I am not going to share one of these moments, or any moment with you, ever again. You were one of my best friends. Truth be told, I still talk to you when I can't sleep. Hope you can hear me. Good luck, pal.   So. Chem diploma today. I was roughly half prepared, or prepared enough to barely pass, but I figured I bullshitted myself to at least 90% on the written response. Go me. Hard alcohol makes perfect cough medicine. I'm not talking the entire liquor cabinet, just a couple shots of whiskey make it all feel better. Went to Jeff's today. Played NFL Street for XBOX. Fun game, I like hurting simulated people.  Drums went shitty today. Only three hours. Andy, you gotta kick it up, bud. No one cares for people with no work ethic.  Bio tommorow. Going to go prepare.
