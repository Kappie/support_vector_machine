That seems pretty cool to me. One thing that seems amazing(especially in my school)is that I'm not considered homosexual. I have seen guys talking to girls for a matter of minutes and be placed under suspicion of homosexuality. Yet all they were talking about was a movie. I have spoken about how a girls time of the month can affect a guy, and my friends have even contributed. Though, when those same girls talk to those guys w/out me about that same subject, they start to back away and call each other gay. It's the same thing w/ talking to guys. I'll be talking about what girls are hot and I'm not considered a pig. Many guys talk about stuff like that in detail like I have and were nicknamed"horny dinosaurs" I don't know what I say but I guess I'm good at it. Just hope it keeps up.
