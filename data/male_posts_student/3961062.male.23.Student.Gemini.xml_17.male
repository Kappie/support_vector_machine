While reading one of my textbooks on Middle Eastern politics earlier this week, a quoted section discussing the lethargy of the Ba'athist party in Syria stood out to me. One sentence in particular caught my eye, but more because it seems to describe Midwestern U.S. Christians than because of the context in which it was written. I quote: "They talk much more than they act. . .  In fact, culturally, they seem to reflect their society far too much to be able to radically transform it ."[Emphasis mine]. When I look at Western Christians in general, indeed when I look at my own Christianity, there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between us and those who don't believe. Of course, on the west coast and in the northeast this is a bit different, but here in the "Bible Belt" everyone's a "Christian". Or so they say. But are the genuine believers even distinct enough from the surrounding cultural climate in order to impress slight changes, let alone radical transformation? That doesn't seem to be the case from my view. Thoughts, please.
