Habibi here, just updating her blog because she threatened me :(  Not really, but she did ask me to, so I thought I'd do the proper thing and update it.  Just in case you guys didn't know, Amy is one of the coolest people on the face of this planet, so you better watch out, she rules.  I'm ready for Thursday, only 1 period I really have to worry about, Challenge, then I goto Shattered Dreams, then I guess Government but we'll probably jack around that period.  Then, during flex, I get to head to Irving to watch the band perform at UIL, hurray! I can't wait actually, I'm anxious to hear the songs.  Well, I'll talk to you guys later..  -Habibi-
