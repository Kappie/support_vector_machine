Plus he formats his strangely. Oh well, I'm just now finishing that and I still haven't done any Calculus or English. Sh*t. Ferget it though, I'm going to bed. And Richard, I don't care if the Asian looks good. I really don't. I care about how good my bed feels and who is in it. (Me and maybe someone else, but it's gotta be that special one...)
