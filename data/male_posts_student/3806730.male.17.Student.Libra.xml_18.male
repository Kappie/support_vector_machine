Anyway, here's another song na lang.. originally Bob Marley's, done again by Annie Lennox, and featured in the movie Serendipity's soundtrack.  The movie was okay, and the soundtrack's good too, by the way.    I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love. From the very first time I rest my eyes on you, girl, My heart says follow t'rough. But I know, now, that I'm way down on your line, But the waitin' feel is fine:  So don't treat me like a puppet on a string, 'Cause I know I have to do my thing. Don't talk to me as if you think I'm dumb; I wanna know when you're gonna come - soon.  I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love I don't wanna wait in vain for your love,  'Cause if summer is here, I'm still waiting there; Winter is here, And I'm still waiting there.  Like I said:  It's been three years since I'm knockin' on your door, And I still can knock some more.  Ooh girl, ooh girl, is it feasible? I wanna know now, for I to knock some more. Ya see, in life I know there's lots of grief, But your love is my relief.
