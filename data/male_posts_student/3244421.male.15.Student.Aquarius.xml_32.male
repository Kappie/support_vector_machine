I love going up there and escaping from the heat and sitting on my grandparents deck, just relaxin and readin a book.  Ahhhhhh its so nice.    Well........ Not much is new (like always, i know i know, i am boring)  anyways....... My friend Daniel E. got me hooked on this really cool Anime From Japan called "Naruto."  Its so cool!  I first watched this awesome music video that combined clips from the anime, with the song My immortal by Evanescence (great song)..Any ways.... I thought the music video was outstanding!  it was so cool.  The Anime clips and the song lined up perfectly, creating a really cool effect!  After watching the Music video, i was intrigued to watch the anime, and so i went to...... http://www.narutocentral.com/index.php?id=fullepisodes_rm.html  I have only downloaded the first one so far b/c my internet is screwy, but i loved it!!!! Its probably one of the coolest animes i have seen!  I strongly suggest going and downloading it (its free!)  You won't be sad that you did.  I would also suggest going here........  http://www.narutocentral.com/index.php?id=amv_mbbp01.html  ...... and downloading Gaara's terror.  (THats the music video i was talking about!)    Well, my fingers are getting tired, lol, so thats all i am posting for now  Later  Eric
