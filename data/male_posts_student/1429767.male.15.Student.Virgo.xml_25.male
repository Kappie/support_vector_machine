Always alone and always sad about it... unlike angst, you don't have to look for a reason to be miserable.  You want to be in the company of people but aren't sure how to act when you're with them.  Sometimes you have to make an effort.  You can't always wait for others to come to you.    urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
