Nothing major, just the billions of kids on Friday, barely anyone on Saturday, and billions of people Sunday.  Its always funny when you are trying to leave at 6:15 and people come up to you asking for a ride and then they get all pissed off at you cause you tell them that the zoo closed 15 minutes ago.  Go figure.  Saw the Last Samurai Saturday night.  Phenominal movie.  Its gotta go into my Samurai collection of movies... ok, so that collection only consists of Seven Samurai from Kurosawa, but hey, its a start.  So my week will be a very busy one.  So much to do.  Places to go, people to see, people to meet, things to finish, movies to watch, alcoholic beverages to drink.  Who knows.  Tuesday I have a nutrition test.  Wednesday is our second black belt class, so should be fun. Friday is my brithday and apart from the 300 busloads of children at the zoo that day, I may want to have a bit of a party.  Going out.  Nothing major.  I dunno.  Either that or I just want to see the new Shrek.  Im easy to please.   Saturday is a buddy's wedding and the Founder's Day banquet for the Lodge.  Sunday is for recovery... Who wants to go to the zoo?  Not me... hehe.  Ok, time to get working!
