First off, they do things a littel different in XP, but it can still be done. The best way I find, is going into   My Computer   then   Right-Click   on the drive you want to perform scandisk, and click on   Properties  . Next, click on the tab at the top that says   Tools   then under   Error-checking   select   Check Now  .  Not too hard after all, eh? :)      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
