Anyway, today was my English Literature exam - an exam where it is by no means an exam on your knowledge of English literature and it isn't really an exam on  English  literature; my set text was Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck; an American. The poems that I looked at were written by an American, a welsh person, an Irish person and a Scottish person. No one technically English was involved in my English exam. But what is it to be English? They all speak the same language, some of their descendents could have quite possibly been English and an 'English' persons ancestors could quite possibly be Anglo-Saxons or of some other European origin. Who is English?  As it is indeed Friday night [now Saturday morning], I went out for a meal earlier, except on finishing the mile walk to the Indian restaurant, one of our party realized they had forgot something which meant that I had to get from the restaurant, back to the house, and back again - a two mile round trip - all in time for the first course. I did it, partly as they were delayed by a few minutes and partly because I ran a good deal of it. Getting back to the restaurant I arrived in good time to receive my curry. I would like to inform anyone considering doing a two mile run and then going for a meal, to go for something a bit more cooler, like a sandwich, curries just don't seem to be quite the right thing.  On the topic of sandwiches I recommend a Safeway Chicken and Bacon 'sub' [you know, one of those baguette like things which isn't], at Â£2.69 its hardly value for money but for a cold and wet May day it worked for me. Speaking of baguettes, Sally's Place provides an excellent guide to them. Let them eat cake.
