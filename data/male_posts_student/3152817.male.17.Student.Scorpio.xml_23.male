I strongly encourage you to read the original posts in their entirety before reading this post.       Comments and response from "Liberal Garbage"     What exactly did Moore expect Bush to do?  As soon as Dick Cheney heard about the attacks, he called for the planes to be shot down. That's how a responsible executive reacts. Unfortunately, by the time his words were conveyed, the attacks had already gone through.  I believe that Vice President Cheney did exactly the right thing.  He was the one who was first briefed on what was happening, (to the best of our knowledge) so he was in a better position to make the call.  You liberals would be ranting just as loud if Bush would have rushed out of a room full of frightened children to give an order to start shooting down anything that had wings and engines.      Jump up, run out of the school, pick up a gun, and start shooting Muslims?  Maybe. You'll have to ask Mr. Moore.  Moore spends a lot of time criticizing Bush's actions yet never suggests what he feels should have been done by the president.      The simple fact is that the Bush's used to be in the Oil Business.  The Bushes are still in the oil business.  George H.W. Bush is still in the oil business.  He no longer has a duty to perform above that of an average American civilian.  I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make here.    Unfortunately, war is sometimes necessary.  I think Mr. Moore's assertion was that the war wasn't necessary. Rather than "demonizing" the U.S. soldiers, as you suggested, I think Michael Moore tried portraying war as damaging to soldiers, their families, and to civilians involved.  Did you not watch this "documentary?"  Moore portrays the our brave fighting men and women as heartless bastards who jump at the chance to slaughter innocent civilians.       Comments and response from "You don't support John Kerry...Why should your Ketchup?"     John Kerry is married to Teresa Heinz, owner of the Heinz Foundation, a philantrhopic organization which gives back to environmental and other causes. She owns relatively little stock of Heinz Corp., and she does not sit on the board of directors. Actually, the Heinz family (that is, those that were related to Senator John Heinz, of Pennsylvania before his tragic plane crash) are mostly Republicans. John Heinz himself actually was.  Well isn't Teresa just an angel?  Maybe the pope should declare her a saint along with Mother Teresa.    I'm not really trying to bash the Heinz company.  I'm simply pointing out that there is an alternative.  As I said before, a purchase of "W Ketchup" benefits the Freedom Alliance Scholarship fund.  This wonderful scholarship helps children whose parents are serving our great nation on active duty in the armed forces.    It is interesting to point out that until Teresa married Sen. Kerry, she was, herself, a republican.  (Talk about taking a step down in the world)  She was a major supporter of Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Spector.  I'm surprised a Joe Hoeffel supporter like you, Devin, would stand up for Teresa.       Comments and response from "Trouser Treason"     Do you read Newsmax? Read about Joseph Goebbels? Because you seem fond of spreading propaganda.  Don't lecture me about propaganda.  Moore's movie, which you so promptly came to the defense of, is nothing but a piece of liberal propaganda.  But I guess liberal propaganda is ok.      Bill Clinton said it's something to "laugh about" because Berger's messy desk while an official was obviously an inside joke among people in the White House. And to correct you, he "stuffed" documents into his "pants" pocket, and one lone witness told of the sock comment. I don't recall the witness being named; how credible is an unnamed source?   What does Berger's "messy desk" (I don't think it's in our best interest to have classified information pertaining to national security sloppily spread around the NSA's desk.  Do you?)  have to do with him "stuffing" classified documents in his pants, shirt, socks, shoes, or ass for that matter?  I don't care how he took the documents.  You liberals try to blind people with pointless details.  The simple fact is, Berger took documents he knew he was not supposed to take.      John Kerry, as a senator, has authority to read classified documents. Why would he need Sandy Berger to do this? With as many "leaks" (none of which have been identified and brought to justice) coming out of the White House at odd times, you would think this was a Republican tactic (i.e. Amb. Joe Wilson's wife).  The Republicans accused Bill Clinton of striking Al Qaeda after the USS Cole ... to distract the public from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. That's quite the excuse. Both parties make suggestions like these.  A federal investigation has been pending for several months. It's a huge newsmaker.   Were you part of the team that "wagged the dog" for Clinton, because you're pretty good yourself at trying to distract people's attention from the topic? Kerry can't use classified information he obtains himself in attacks against the president.  If one of his "advisors" told him something that was later found out to be classified, Kerry can push the blame on his advisor.   Joe Wilson will get his own post here at Duct Tape and Gum Bands in the near future.  For now I'll say that Wilson's wife, a desk jockey at Langley, isn't a "covert" agent.  Her life wasn't threatened or her sources (if any) compromised by Novak's column.  It's also worth pointing out that all of Wilson's remarks about Uranium have been proven false, thus making the ambasador look like an incompetant moron to the whole world.  Amazing that the liberal media has barely whispered about THAT part of the story.    Bill Clinton bombed some abandoned tents in the deserts after the USS Cole.  Hardly a stong message to send to islamic extreamists.  Kill our soldiers and we'll launch a missile at a tent!  I'm sure Clinton's "response" had Bin Laden and company shaking in their turbans.
