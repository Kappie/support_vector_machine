More curve than a man could ask,     with her-    Raven black hair and,    Great hourglass.      But she got no reason,    And she got no care,    Why she looks,     The way she dares.      Yeah Yeah Yeah      She got a mind of her own    (Thank god)    Voices her opinion,    And she shapes my world.    I Wish I could have her,    (A girl of my own)    But I can't.    I want to forgive her,     But I won't.      She will Never change,     Because of what she's told.    She does what she believes in,     And it is so bold.    But thats the thing,    She doesn't Notcie me,     How do I get you to see girl,     you Rock my damn world.      Does this song catch you friend?    Do your ears burn?    Have you ever thought of reading signals, even giving me a call?      I doubt it, and you never, will.    A man can dream,     just don't knock me back down.  --------------------------------------       Lost prophets concert t'morrow though, woo!  I can't wait.  I don't know how to break it to Lindsay though.  My friend and his girlfriend wwere supposed to go to the concert with us, but they cancelled.  She's going to think I set this whole thing up.  I hope she still goes.  She made it bluntly clear we are "just going as friends," yet she has told me straighforword that she wouldn't mind dating me.  She keeps send me these mixed signals.  I don't know if she really wants me, If she's just a cocktease, or if she's just schizto.  HELP!!!!   I don't know wht to do, help me out, whatever fans/readers/googlebase I might have.
