But apart from that I do not have a hell of a lot to do so am thinking up new ways of wasting time.  Still not totally wasted time I have started watching my DVD of coupling.  Really good and really funny.  The 4th season has just started coming out although without Jeff got to admit I am cynical about how they can keep it up without jeff but been looking at what people are saying it does okay  Cu later
