       
      I did something last night that I swore I would never do.  I left a friend high and dry for a girl.  While I now understand the other end of the spectrum and how it's easy to do something like that, I've made myself into a hypocrit.  I am an ass, and I feel really bad about it. I wish I could go back and correct it.
