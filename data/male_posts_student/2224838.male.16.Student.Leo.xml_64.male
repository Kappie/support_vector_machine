To enter you must create a script and storyboard for a 30 second public service announcement to educate children about "protectiong themselves from abduction, violence, and exploitation." The winner will fly to Hollywood and work with a team of film professionals to produce his concept into an actual 30-second spot. In addition, that writer will receive a $5,000 cash prize, as well as $2,000 for his teacher and $1,000 for the school.   $5,000? Film professionals? That's enough incentive for me to give it a shot.
