To give you an image of his size and look, when he is full grown, he will be similar to a lab and a greyhound. Not as heavy as a lab, not as small and thin as a greyhound.  Grey-ish coat and blue eyes.  Once he is full grown,  Will  will compete in dog shows. He needs to get 10 points to become a Canadian Champion (something like that).  So far, he has been venturing around the house, sleeping, eating, playing in the backyard, nawing on the concrete rocks, you know, things that dogs like to do. As far as I know, his official registered name will be Good  Will  Hunting. Oh yeah, he has a micro-chip in his back... he's a techi too! :D   urlLink     Will  1  (With His Brothers  Sisters)    urlLink     Will  2  (Looking Proud)     urlLink     Will  3  (Roaming The Backyard)    urlLink     Will  4  (Sitting)    urlLink     Will  5  (Most Likely Eating Twigs)    urlLink     Will  6  (Yeah... I don't know, he looks like a dinosaur.)
