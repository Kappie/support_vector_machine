I expected Fantasia to win, but I didn't really expect Diana. She got a great voice nonetheless! Incidentally, the two of them were what all 3 judges predict could be in the finals! Woot! The next group is sucky though. I only like the Briana Ramirez-Rial. Meow moo!   Hmm. Today has almost been boring. The only interesting thing that happened is that I mopped the floor lor. I don't really like mopping the floor of the rooms and the hall. I can't really spot any difference. The kitchen however, is so dirty with all the stains (oil, food, this and that) that when you mopped, you can see the dirt being cleaned off. That gives me a lot of statisfaction. HaHa. Weird meow meow.   Hmm. I also spent the whole day planning and calling cats for the pool thing tonight. WQ got very annoyed at my constant calling. Sorry la. Even ducks meow. Hmmm. Meow moo! I must come back in time for Survivor. I hope Sabago wins this time! Hmm! Rupert's in danger! Meow moo!!  Okay. I end le la. See ya tomorrow (before I go to the MAA. WEE!!)! Bye bye!
