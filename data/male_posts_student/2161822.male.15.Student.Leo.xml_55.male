They deceive us...So the first week back from Christmas vacation was...well...terrible. What a shock. I sort of enjoed not having to hear Spanish at 11 in the morning. We come back to school and get swamped with tests. Not cool. I miss summer vacation alot. Or any vacation for that matter. But I think I might have found a way to make the days go by faster and put a little fun in the weeks. Making a movie. Random penguins. Abused clowns. Robert and Evert would give it 7 stars. Anybody with a penguin costume, please contact me immediately. Until then, this is where I leave. Rock on.  Listen to H.I.M.
