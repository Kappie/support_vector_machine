It's so funny. I do believe, though, that we can all prophesy. And God has actually spoken to me before. But I don't think this Deja Vu is all about prophecy.  You know I reread my last post and it really didn't make sense! :) But I'm not gonna change it. Anyway I'm still really bored. My friend is giving a crash course in Mainstream music because i don't listen to it. But i'm about to give her a crash course in CCM and Worship Music. So I guess I'll just sign off for real this time.  :) SMILE! GOD LOVES YA!
