Later in the afternoon, me and WQ went to Changi Airpot. We had this crazy idea yesterday. HaHa. We are going there to walk around lor. For fun. You say we bo liao right? HeHe. We took bus 858 there, a journey totalling 57 minutes (WQ timed the trip. HaHa!).    We arrived in Terminal 1 and started walking around lor. Quite empty...until I saw a group of people (mainly Chinese) sitting around the Departure Hall. Obviously, they are waiting for their plane, and given their looks, they are going to China. HaHa. Inference inference!  We took the skytrain towards Terminal 2. That's way way bigger than Terminal 1 and more cats. We explored that place, walking from the basement till the top floor. At the Viewing Mall, I saw the planes taking off. I was awed by their majesty. Such a whole load of metal parts can actually glide through the air. I am such a suagu right?  HaHa...the thought really awed me lor.  After that, we went to Burger King to eat. I can't afford a meal, so I brought a single burger, BBQ Bacon something something. Wah...so hot, and sticky. HaHa. We set off home lor, taking the same bus.  I dopped off near 768 to buy dinner back for me and brother. I brought zhap fan, he brought yu pian mi fen. I ate dinner, watched TV, bathed and came online lor.   Sigh....yesterday and today so much things happened. I cannot write here....I badly want to tell you lor, but can't. I write in my diary book instead la.... Sigh lor...  I remembered a song in the shower. It's from The Truth About Jane and Sam, Zhen Xin Hua. It goes like this: Xi Huan Ni, Xiang Ai Ni, Xiang Shuo Zhen Xin Hua (Like you, Love you, Wanna Tell The Truth). I just thought of it lor....haha.... ~goes singing that line~  I think I am going le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
