Gradually, he was out of the town, but he saw stranger things now, a whole road which is paved in black with strips of white in between.  Tai Wu, “Is this how the future looks like? It looks…scary…”  Now, the whole path is exposed in front of him, mountains scaling the skies in the far right, occasional people carrying swords of different size and shapes walking down various paths, in the far front looks cloudy and gloomy with lightning striking down frequently.   Tai Wu, “That’s the place where I have to go…? Well, it doesn’t seem I have much of a choice.”  Nudging his giant sword a little and starting to pick up his pace, Tai Wu proceeded. Unfortunately, the place appears further than expected; Tai Wu had been traveling to the other area for 2 days but without avail, although hungry and exhausted, that was the only clue he has, thus he pushed on. Strangely, even though 2 days had been past, there were still noticeable lightning strikes on that area.  On the 4th day, Tai Wu finally reached the area; this area is a queer sight. There is a town within the area, but the area itself had been fenced off by constant lightning strikes on the border, the town however didn’t suffer any kind of damages. There was also no thunder sounding.  Tai Wu, “The so-called fire wielder competition is held there? How can I get in the first place?”  Nobody is in the town; the buildings in the town were somewhat new to him, they were tall and comparable to the emperor’s palace in terms of majestic and awe.   Female voice, “ Hey! Don’t just stand there! Come help me a little!”   Tai Wu, “ Huh? Where are you?”  Female voice, “Are you dumb!? Here…Hereeeeee!!”  Tai Wu looked around the place, only seeing a small sized girl holding twin kodachi, she’s masked and wearing a dark green cloak, seemingly of an assassin. She stood at the border, raising her twin blades to counter the lightning strikes, whenever a lightning strike hits her sword, the lightning will get reflected away and even grow bigger.  Tai Wu, “That’s…that’s amazing…”  Female, “ Are you truly dumb?!!! I need help here!!!!”  Tai Wu, “Oh…yes!!”  Tai Wu unbound the cloth of Flamer, raising the sword with both hands and headed off to the Female’s help. The fiery lightning hitting down forced Tai Wu off, added that the sword was almost impossible to use for adequate turns and shifts, Tai Wu can only swing Flamer around in a crude and clumsy manner. Pin-pointing the correct timing to swing Flamer, he pushed the girl out to safety while he swings his giant sword to effectively deflect off a few of the lightning strokes. The lightning got reflected back as well, however the beam did not grow bigger; instead it gradually integrated and became nothing. Seizing the chance, Tai Wu got out of this lightning nightmare as well.  Tai Wu, “Pant…crap…this sword is just tedious to even carry. Hey…are you alright?”  The female just stood there, eyes flashing with joy. She has already kept the kodachi during the intervene of Tai Wu helping her.  Female, “youyouyouyouyouyouyouyou…”  Tai Wu, “Wha..wha..what?”  Female, “Are you a fire wielder?”  Tai Wu thought, “Even though I don’t know what is a fire wielder, but it seems I can save more trouble being one…”  “Yap I am.”  Female, “Haahaha, finally found one! Come with me now!” Grabbing Tai Wu’s hand while she said it.  Tai Wu, “Hey hey!! What are you up to? First you called me a dummy, second you didn’t even thank me for saving you, thirdly now you just pull me around like I’m a toy…At least say what are you up to!” He said sounding annoyed. Brushing off her hands, Tai Wu placed Flamer on his shoulders and began to walk when the girl suddenly leaped in front of him.   Tai Wu, “What the…”  Female, “Alright alright, I apologize for being so rude…Sorieeeeee.” She sounded joking while saying ‘Sorie’.   Tai Wu, “Er…ok ok…What is it?” She started to remove the mask…  Tai Wu, “…?”  Having removed the mask, she revealed a sweet smile, “Ah…this feels much better, a hate the smell of that mask.” Saying that she chunked the mask to the ground, and slowly walked towards the unmoving Tai Wu in a emotional manner. Tai Wu stood there blushing a little, this time looking really like a dummy.  She tip-toed and whispered into his ears, “Don’t you think I’m cute?” Soon after, she kissed him on the cheeks…and jumped aside laughing a little. Tai Wu’s face was totally red now, he hasn’t had much communication with any girl, except maybe the granny who had brought him up.  Female, “Haha, your face is so red, cccuuuttttteee…” she said laughingly. Suddenly reminded that his face is pure heat now, he scrubbed is face with his hands.  Female, “Hahaha, ok ok. I’ll stop teasing you. My name is Karean Miyamoto. That’s K.A.R.E.A.N .M.I.Y.A.M.O.T.O, remember it well, okie?”  (to be continued)
