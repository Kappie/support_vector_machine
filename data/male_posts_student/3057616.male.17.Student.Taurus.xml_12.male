Everybody seems to be studying... and thats no exception for me too... but marketing seems so difficult.... I just cant grasp hold of the concepts surrounding it... Then there is the CCC involvement and the partial involvement in YFC as well... then I guess I would be in Strings Enssamble too... arrrgh... so busy... dunno how to manage my time le....  If this continues to go on... I might have to drop some of my involvement in church liaw.... and I guess this would not be very good....  I've told Timothy and Jason about my past already... I really really wonder how they think about me now that they know who I was in the past... do they secretly dispise me?... I... I dont think so... but... there is a high possibility too.... My past would throw a person who know me for the first time into either hatred, a stunted friendship... or a really beautiful friendship.. because... that is the only secret I have to hide.... Once you know my past, you know 99% of me... basically because i dont exectly know that 1% either...  Tests are coming tests are coming! Stress stress stress... haha... but I'm sure with God's grace, I will be able to pass the tests.... However, for now, I must put in my best effort....  Until now I wonder if it is a mistake that I revealed myself so openly to my 2 frens who are so close to me....... but new...  I hope that God will take care of them and bless whatever they do.......  What am I feeling now: Stressed (?) ... Rather deep in thought now.......
