First I have one of my buddies over and we watch some really bad Jet Li movie called The Enforcer. Standard Kung-Fu movie. So horribly bad it's good. Favorite scene is when the main character manages to defy the laws of physics and hang in midair for about 45 seconds(Horizontally mind you.) while firing a shotgun about five times(Without pumping it.). Second favorite is him tying his son to a rope and throwing him at the bad guys. The son spins around and kicks people. Great fun.  So that was fun by itself but by no means makes my day. Next off I get to finish mowing the freaking lawn with a newly fixed lawnmower. As a side rant,  I bloody hate lawnmowers!  The damn things always break on me for no real reason. Kinda like Windows. Of course I have a shower cause hey, I just mowed the lawn.  Then comes the part making me really happy. My girlfriend got off work and came over to watch some movies. Now, keep in mind that because of work(All minimum wage of course) we hadn't seen each other for about four or five days. And this is with us living like two minutes walking away from one another. So almost instantly the stress that's been building up on me for a while just melted away. As for what exactly happened to make me so happy.......  Fuck you and get your mind out of the gutter. Sheesh, perverts.  Drunk On Ambrosia,  -Dant
