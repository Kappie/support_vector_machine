I was given a FULL TUITION award!  I wept when I opened the letter because I never expected such a large award.  I am currently waiting on my letter from Vanderbilt University in Nashville.  After getting their offer, Jason and I will make our decision about where we will be living and going to school.  Keep watch for more news!  Also, Jason received a promotion at his job that will hopefully go through in the next week or so.  Though we don't know how much more money this will be, it is a very good move for him in the company.  God has certainly rained down his blesssings on us this week!  I want to say thank you to each one of you who have prayed about these things for us.  After I was asked to withdraw from Abilene Christian University because I was gay, we were worried about what our future would hold.  However, with these wonderful blessings, I will be able to attend school for less money than I paid to attend at ACU, and Jason and I will be financially secure!  Thank you again for your prayers!
