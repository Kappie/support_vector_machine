Today was registration day for second year of med school....I wasn't really looking forward to today but seeing my old classmates was actually pretty cool....I was doing some silly flirtation...I think I might have actually missed a couple of them....oh well.....lets see if I feel the same way after the first block....  So as of late I have been talking to a rather interesting young lady....she's real cool....we'll see where it goes....  Not much else to say right now....gotta read some Behavioral Sciences stuff (I'm also taking Biochemistry this semester and some more physical diagnosis)....
