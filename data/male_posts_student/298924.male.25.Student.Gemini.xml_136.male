I headed to Best Buy to buy the digital camera of my dreams only to find it not in stock....disappointment reigns....I got Vanilla Sky to ease my sorrow....I have yet to watch it....  My sister Nina and I then headed to a family friends house for dinner....lots of good food and interesting conversation....my mom's friend has two children who have both graduated from college....the younger attends Morehouse School of Medicine (going into her second year like me) and her oldest makes Blackhawk Helicopters....one thing I can say about when we all get together is that we always have interesting conversation....I think the biggest shocker was my very strong anti-marriage sentiments (they get stronger by the minute)....I just feel that this world is moving toward a place where marriage just has no place....I'll say more about this later if I feel so inclined....  Nina had passes to this "thing" (for lack of a better word/phrase on what to call it) at Evander Holyfield's crib....dude's land is just the most....I mean really....the MOST....Evander just has too much....his pool is bigger than my mom's house....hey...more power to him....I ran into this dude that is writing a book on my grandfather allegedly....sometimes I wonder about these "fate" meetings with people....like someone upstairs has a wonderfully sadistic sense of humor....  See the night before while having a talk with Beth, my balling-in-New York-buddy, my moms knocks on my door and tells me that my grandfather has been hospitalized with jaundice (yellow skin....among other things a sign of liver failure) so instead of going to the family reunion we are going to Mississippi....  Needless to say running into buddy made my stomach turn....this guy just wants to make some quick bucks to tell a story that means too much to me to see it go to waste....my grandfather deserves more....he spits some mumbo jumbo about how he wants my grandfather to live to see it published and aaaaaaaaalllll I have to do is help him get some amount of money from Dr. Walter Massey (Morehouse's president....like me and him are just old chums or something!!!) for some book he wrote way back when....  Anyway....so my mother and I head to Meridian, Mississippi (where my grandparents live) on Friday....as is our custom we ate at Cracker Barrel on the way....I made a bad choice with my breakfast but my hashbrown casserole was good....we arrive in Meridian and head straight to the hospital....my grandmother meets us in the hallway and tells us that it's the "worst possible news"....my grandfather has liver cancer....he's dying....  We don't know how long he will be here....I'm on standby mode as I type this because I know at any moment I might have to head back to Mississippi....the worst part was breaking the news to my father....he loves my grandfather....it's a long story but the short version is that my mother's father went to Morehouse with my dad's father....he pledged him.....and through some twist of fate (or God's work depending on your perspective) their daughter and son, respectively, met and fell in love....I am the result of that love....we lost my father's father (my namesake) in 1993....in that time I have gotten alot closer with my other grandfather....he held my hand the entire time I was in the room with him on Friday....  I feel right now like my world is coming apart....God is really showing me who is in control of things and there is nothing I can do about it other than pray....my friend Erica was telling me on the way back to Nashville how the Bible tells us to celebrate death and mourn birth....it makes sense but is easier said than done....Life is all I know....death is a great mystery....I KNOW that eventually everyone I love and even my own essence will be lost to me....how can I be comfortable in that....  Anyway I am making myself angry, sad, and confused....I'm through typing for tonight as this has turned into something I didn't want it to....
