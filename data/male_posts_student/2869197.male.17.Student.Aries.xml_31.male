I whiff of Democratic prejudice from this book, and have that feeling that he's not telling the full story, but overall it is an informative read. I've always feared my cafeteria's hamburgers (bone pieces should not be your primary source of calcium) over McDonald's and now I have logic to back my intuition. The book has been beating down on the horrors of insanitary actions as well. These fall on deafened ears. I readily think to myself that the meat I've been eating for nigh 17 years has yet to kill me. It is too tasty to stop now.  Well, back to my recent displeasures of the Republican party. Apparently, they've been taking a lot of campain contributions (read: bribes) for the meatpacking industry. Their antiunion tactics and complete hatred of all federal regulation make me feel more and more Democratic. I feel so...unclean. Tell you what: I'll agree with my Democratic other-siders that we should regulate the heck out of big business if they agree we should do next to nothing with small business. Mkay? But economic reasons aside, I'm still a fervent Republican for moral reasoning. I get that warm fuzzy feeling when Bushie walks onto the stage that I really don't get with Dean or many other Dems. Abortion, homosexual marriages, drug control, and states' rights are too strong in my heart for me to consider moving to the Dark Side.
