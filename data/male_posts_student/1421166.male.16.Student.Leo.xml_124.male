But this could be a good way of having a break.  I really like the new skins that blogger offer. Although this isn't exactly original anymore, but it's still cool.  I seem to be at a lost of words, not knowing what to say after my cessation of blogging. Maybe I could update another time, or maybe I'll just let everyone know that I've been having great peace during this time of examinations, yet, I've got the feeling that I ain't going to do well this time. Yeah, it isn't disturbing, I'm still peaceful. Oh, by the way, the comprehension passage was interesting.
