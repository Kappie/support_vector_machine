It still seems like there's so much crap to do, and I don't think I'll be able to completely relax until I've seen my final grades. One Acts is tonight. Ha ha. That should be interesting. I can't believe I only have one more day as an active LC student. It's weird. It's scary. Hold me.  Irrelevant spoiler of the day: I am running out of irrelevant spoilers. I must consider changing their format. For today, how about this... Episode III will probably be nothing like the episode of Gilmore Girls I have to miss tonight because of the stupid One Acts. I would say that's pretty accurate.  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
