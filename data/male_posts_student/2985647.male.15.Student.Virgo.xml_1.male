I left one of my wanted signs in the Dressing Room, hiding on one of the weight machines which he will hopefully see, and, in the superstore, I put different players' shirts in front of his so no one could find them. He is a bit of a bastard though. The stadium was nice though, saw the Dressing room, press room, shop, tunnel, dugouts, sheep farm, money vault (big, full of sheep) and the Shed End (full of sheep).
