On Tuesday I sat around and slept and did random things. On Wednesday Sarah and I went to the Village Hills Little League field and talked with Mike, Eric, and Cindy. Afterwards, me and Sarah went to Mervyn's, Albertson's and Walmart to buy goodies. Yesterday, which was coincidentally Thursday, Sarah and I went to the Gaviota beach and hung out with the likes of Eric, Cindy, Jay, and his Sarah. After awhile, we grew bored, so Sarah and I fled to Goleta and went shopping. We went back to the beach and sat around for an hour and a half or so, and then returned to Lompoc. Then we watched a few movies and enjoyed eachother's company. Good. Bye bye.
