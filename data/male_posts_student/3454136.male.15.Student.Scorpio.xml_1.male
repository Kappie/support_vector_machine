In return, I'll share some of the fun, ok? Hehe.  Let's c, this will be a loose role-play kinda thing so that'll be a bit of tolerance for role-switching and out-of-role-ness. Just don't do it too much, kk?  Oh of course... Since only blog members can post, u'll need to be a blog member to role-play :).  Anyways, here's my first role:  Hello, I'm Criff. I'm a mage-in-training. Well, technically not a mage cause I can't really cast any spells... But, c, I got this kool sword. It's got these kool rune carvings. My teacher says it's created by his ancester, Alchemist Bran, with the aid of the Runesmith Raken. This sword means a lot to me. It's the key to make my dream come true. My dream... it's like this. There's a city, one that u might've heard of. It's called Druwyn. It's a place where the most powerful magic users gather. In fact, there's a rule for entering Druwyn: Only those who are either born in Druwyn or highly talented in the use of magic may enter. I want to go there. Because... because my father's there. He's a powerful archmage and I want to measure up to him. This has always been my goal. I was set offtrack, however, when the New Rune Academy rejected me. They said that I couldn't use magic at all. I was soon back on track, however, when I set out to seek a mage who could teach me to use magic one way or another. That's how I came to my teacher and this sword. But not before someone whom I had grown close to died. I'll never forget Belth. He was a friend and a mentor to me. Nevertheless, I have to go forward towards my dream, with this sword in hand. What exactly does it do u ask? Maybe u'll c if u c me fight...
