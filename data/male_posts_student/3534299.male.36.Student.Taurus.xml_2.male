But our actions, not intentions, decide who we are, and my wish remained unfulfilled until today when I started this. Thanks to Perry. I have titled this collection, and I will make this a collection, "Living in Vegas." Why? Because you doubt if you ever live in Vegas. It's such a quiet, business-like city, don't get taken in by the strip? I have been living here for the past 18+ months and liked the place despite some not-so-likeable experiences. Let me tell you what I like about Vegas.  1. I like its down-to-earth, keep-minding-your-business attitude 2. UNLV, of course 3. MFA program 4. Lied Library 5. Writing Center 6. UNLV campus 7. UNLV Bookstore 8. Flamingo - Albertsons - which is where we get our groceries from 9. The desert climate and landscape 10. People in general - they seem to be more accepting of foreigners 11. The sky 12. Birds - I don't know them yet. I wish to know about them. Wish had an ornithologist as a friend. I could take five walks with him a day. 13. For some sentimental reason, I like Sierra Vista Drive, the street where I first lived after coming here. 14. My humble achievements - among them, a co-authored business writing case, a possible novel  More tomorrow.
