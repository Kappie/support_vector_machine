Cause now that I can see you, I don't think you're worth a second glance.  So much for all the promises you made, they served you well, Now you're gone and they're wasted on me.  So much for your endearing sense of charm, it served you well, Now it's worn and it's wasted on me.  I guess that all you've got is all you're gonna get.  - Dashboard Confessional- Rapid Hope Loss
