Jeff and other bloggers like Glenn Rynolds and Hugh MacLeod all make a very good case that blogs and similar media will take the lead in media influence in the years to come. I'm not 100% convinced of that, but they do make a very good point. Jeff and Hugh are particularly convincing.   UPDATE:  Jeff  urlLink touches on the subject  further. And then  urlLink some more .
