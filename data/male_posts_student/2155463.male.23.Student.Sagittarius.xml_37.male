The program sounds cool and all, and it will be nice to get away from here for a while, but the main reason is because one of the students who did the program last year told about her time with the D.C. Public Defenders Office.  Now THIS is what I want to do...I think I'm also going to apply to the D.C. Prosecution office, but either of the two sound good.  Her internship sounded awesome - VERY hands-on, getting right "into the action" and actually interacting with people (while practicing law...from what she told me, it's kind of a cross between an investigator and a paralegal).  Maybe it's just the thought that I might get shot (a lot of the work is in the ghettos, etc. - she worked on a murder case last year), but I think it's mostly the concept that this is EXACTLY what I want to do (i.e. help people who can't help themselves and/or work in the public interest).  At least, I think so, and that's why this is so perfect...I can find out if prosecution or public defender is what I want to do, whether I can put up with the ethical dilemmas and situations that doing so would entail (and also finding out what is fact and what is myth).  The WPNI group seems really good, too.  I actually knew quite a number of the people from some of my other classes, but it just seems like everyone is going to get along pretty well (there was even a guy who wanted to work with the RNC!).  Anyway...I need to go study for my Political Econ test, but this was just so awesome, I had to get it down...:D
