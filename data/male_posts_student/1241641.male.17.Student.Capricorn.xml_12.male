Welcome to Wrigley, Chief!  Alright, so today I stared death in the eye...and it walked away.  I was at the Minnesota Zoo looking for an adventure to write about, and a beast to wrestle.  I decided I could kill two birds with one stone and find myself a tiger.  After many attempts to enter the enclosure, I had to settle on an eye-to-eye encounter, literally.  We had half of an inch between us.  Granted, that was the glass, but still, I scared him away.  Nick, 1.  Tiger, 0.  Now onto my attempts to pick-up a pop star...  She was a lost soul looking for love in a lonely city.  I was a young stallion looking to treat a lady right, and a way to boost my own pop career.  I figured if anyone knew anything about playing off other peoples' success, it was her, Ashlee Simpson.  It was a match made in heaven my friends.  But today, the gods were not on my side.  Lost in the hustle at the Mall of America, she could not throw herself into the arms of her calling white knight.  We missed our first opportunity, but destiny has a funny way of finding its doves.  If music be the food of love, sing on Ashlee!
