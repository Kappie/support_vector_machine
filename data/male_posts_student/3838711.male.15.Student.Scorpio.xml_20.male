Anyways, i didnt do my homework as said just now in the last entry, well i couldnt focus well and thus, i whiled my time away talking to Kun Long and packing up my bag.. I found that my focus time is around 5 to 7.. evening time rather, i found myself with lots of zest and energy at that period of time, and i suppose its time to do some re-planning of my time schedule.. to do my work in the evening, and mostly whack some games at night..  I feel that this might be the best arrangement for a person like me, trying to recover from some emotional breakdown. Karie's invited us to go see a movie this Saturday, everything's not been settled yet, but Sherman's already given me the red light.. saying hes got tuition and stuff, and most likely if i did go, it will be me only...  Ah anyway, enough of beating around the bush, i'll fill in more of the details tomorrow, now is my sleep time le... was kinda tired today, fell asleep once in class.. during history.. i hope that tml i wont do this kinda thing again, must stay awake and not miss out any details... Later ! :)
