Not only have i no idea, but also i feel like nothing is the answer. Everyone as a dream, after thinking about it,i have none. I see life as something without meaning. In the end, you die and your forgotten. What is the meaning of existence?   It's true i spend all my time on my pc, but i don't feel like anything else is important anymore... It as been like that for a few years now. What happened? I remember i used to like gym classes, had fun doing maths, i already loved school. Why is it i hate all those things now? What changed?   It's one of those times where you feel broken and hopeless. I feel like that too often is seems. Wishing you were someone else, that things did'nt turn out the way they turned. I really can't understand. I just feel misplaced and in the wrong direction. I wonder how everyone manage to go on with their lives without these interrogations. Everyone is so sure of themselves, looks like i missed a complet chapter of the book of life.   July again, it was july last year, i tought it would be my escape door. In fact it was just a new cell. I tough all my problems and toughts would vanish, but they did'nt. they took hold of me even harder. May this July be more meaningful for my existence...   Wow, i feel like a writer! Well, Bruno should be done with the downloads by now, so let's play some soldat!  Regards,  Zephyr
