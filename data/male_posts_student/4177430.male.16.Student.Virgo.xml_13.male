It's really funny at times (Colin Powell calls chemical weapons "goofy") and really creepy at others (all the holes that still exist in our current infrastructure) and sometimes just makes you pissed off too (if we would have continued Gulf War 1 for another 72 hours and destroyed the Republican Guard, the Shi'ites would have sucessfully risen up and unseated Saddam...instead, they were brutally slaughtered by the R.G. when they rose up--why didn't we help?  We didn't want another Shi'ite government like Iran...).  Clarke also delves into why so many people in the Mideast hate America, drawing on history he experienced firsthand over his 20+ years of service in counterterrorism within the White House.  This guy got so fed up with Bush's fanagling in Iraq that he up and quit.  Very well written and very engaging.  One of the most informative books you'll ever read.
