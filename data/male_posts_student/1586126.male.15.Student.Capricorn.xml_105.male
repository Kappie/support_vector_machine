I dreamt that ppl in the past before discovering "oleo" i think thats oil paints, used to keep watercolors inside them, and they had fishnets inside them to keep the paint out.  I dreampt this because: i learned that ppl before discovering oleo, used eggs. This girl, orestria, talked about her fishnets falling apart in the guild, and talking to my dad about having a fake heart and what would keep it in.
