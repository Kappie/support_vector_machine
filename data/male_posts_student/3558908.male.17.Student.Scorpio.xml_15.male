However, these technologies have advantages which I will discus later on. First, I will concentrate on why educators are still the best sources of education. So, why are the teachers the great sources of education or information? One of the reasons is that they are experienced and they are also experts on their field. Moreover, they are the ones who think of what to learn by the students. They know what to teach and what information that the students must learn. Also, they can discipline the students while they are learning. They can also control the technologies that are used by the students to learn or they can assist them personally if the students have problems. The teachers can exactly tell what to do or give suggestions. These are the some reasons why teachers are still the best source of education. But why technology is a help to teachers and to the students?   Technology is also a great source of education because you can control it in the palm of your hands. You can learn how to use a computer software by just clicking a link or a tutorial in the internet. You can find a lot of this in the cyber world. This is why I am thankful of these innovating technologies to help me in my school work and I will not always depend on the teacher. With these advantages, there are also disadvantages. The students can find information that is cannot help them in education. Like for example, there are distractions like online games and other cyber things. The cost of the gadgets or the technology is not affordable by ordinary students. That is why some of the students are well-equipped or they have advantage to the other students because of their gadgets. For me, these are the reasons why technology can be of help in educating students.  In conclusion, technology can be helpful to teachers in educating the students. But the educators should take precautions to students when they will handle the new technologies. Technology and teachers can be mixed but in the right amount. Too much technology, it can be risky. Too much teachers or old traditional way of teaching, it can be boring. Risky because students may always depend on the technologies or gadgets when doing their school work. Boring because it is the same old style of teaching and the students do not want that. These are my reaction and sides to what I just read.
