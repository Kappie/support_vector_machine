So i stumble up there and get to work. A few hours later I find out this little doofus Tristan isn't showing up. So me being infinitely wise I volunteer to work overtime. I figure it's good money so why not? By 8:30 I'm beat to shit and decide to peace. But alas my parents aren't home so I have to drag my ass down home. Good god I can barely see I'm so tired.  What else has happened?....Yeah not a thing. Just wanted to bitch. Gonna fall asleep to the sweet melodies that are Deathcab for Cutie.  Adios
