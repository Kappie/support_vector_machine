LIFE HAS BEEN INTERESTING AND GREAT LATLEY!!  i couldnt remember all the stuff i have done since my last blog if i tried.  about all i can remember is this last weekend.  jessica was probally the highlight of my weekend.  friday night we had the sports banquet it was cool i got most improved player in football :) and then that night i spent the night a tripps and we had a big water balloon war lol.  then the next day i woke up and it was carwash time!  i had a great time at the car wash workin the corner and washing the cars and all i think the highlight of my carwash was when jessica came though i wasnt sure if she was going to go or not b/c at first i knew she didnt want to but she came.   i just gotta say wow she looked damn good! lol but i talked to her for awhile and washed her car and all and i got really burnt.  my sholders still hurt today.  then  after the carwash i went to a pool party and ate and then went to church and then out to a mexican restraunt all this was with bryndan.  on sunday i dropped him off at home and then came home.  i was waiting for a good time to call jessica so about 100 i called her and we decided i would pick her up to go get coffee at about 2 30.  we went to cups in the mall where i was hyper the whole time lol and i got a pair of shorts and had coin races in the little things if u know what im talking about and she won lol.  then time flew by and it was time to take her home then when i was about to leave she said something about getting back together and i couldnt stop grinning it was amazing i still remember the words she said.  im glad she said it b/c i wasnt sure if she still liked me so i didnt wanna say anything so we talked about it for awhile and pretty much figured stuff out later that day and so me and jessica are dating again but its not as serious as it was b/c im gonna be gone most of summer and i dont want her to be tied down to someone that gonna be gone she needs to have a fun summer.  bryndan thinks im whipped b/c i took jessica back that easy but i cared for her and was always with her for 7 months and i couldnt just stop doing that the feelings didnt ever go away for awhile i tried to make them go away but all i did was push them down for awhile and now luckly i dont have to do that anymore i can actually express what i feel again!  that was about it that happened in my weekend now im sitting here at the computer still all happy and putting off studying chemistry.  but i guess i better go study b/c its on everything since january lol yeah im screwed.  but i will write again some time byz!
