This saddens me.  The thought that you would come here and partake of my intellectual offerings (ok this is not the time to look over previous posts) and not feel the need to contribute back makes me question your character.   Now I know that it seems like my intellectual (ok, I really hope I'm spelling that right) abilities are enough, or even more than enough, but I like to keep "the lesser ones" involved (right Martin?) so please post something that allows me to make fun of you.
