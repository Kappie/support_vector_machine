My dad failed to wake me up at 9 am plus to let me have the time to go supermarket to buy bread and prepare breakfast to Sentosa. Time was running out and the lift was like taking its own sweet time from the 12th storey to get down to 5th storey. In the supermarket, there were long queues and I had to wait.  After the preparation, I met my friend at Woodlands MRT station Control Room. On the way rushing up to the escalators to catch the train, I tripped over the steps. And what happened? Instead of me falling backward and roll down the steps, I had to climb up the steps a few times in order to fall forward. In the process, my right leg was in friction with the rough edge of the steps and there, I got a vampire's fang mark. It's quite long and my blood was dark red. *Sighted* I shouldn't have sracificed myself just to be in time.  When we were in Sentosa's beach, it was indeed an eye-opener to see so many HUNKS! Some playing balls, some sun-tanning, some just chill out. I just got distracted by them the whole day, I couldn't help looking at their nice-bod, their complexion and as well as their cute looks. Wow, it makes me feel so "gay". Actually I am just very envy of them, I wish I could have their look, their figure, their size. Opps... I mean their body size. Look at their developed parts and you will get what I mean. In the mean time, I also felt inferior. I just wish I do possess everything of them. So I just make a pact with myself to try to reduce fats in my body and develope my muscle into good shape. At least they aspired and inspired me to be one of them...  I saw 3 very cute Japanese beach stud walking past, they are my cup of tea. Unlike those "ang moh", body is so big size and not quite proportional. After soaking in the water for long enough, I got down to the shower room. I saw a reflection from the mirror of an old man changing his swimming trunk to underwear, it was unsightful the first thing I stepped into the room. But who cares, I am not interested. Wahahaha.  I proceeded to enter one of the shower cubicle, there's no shower head installed and one long tude of water just flowed out. I am not used to it so I go out and changed to antoher cubicle, this time there is shower head but the water is quite small and there was no lock. So I got out again and went to another side of the cubicles. I was so fussy and particular about it, and ended up people went into the cubicles and I had to wait. While waiting, I went to another side of the cubicle and I saw people waiting outside. Then a few moment later, I went to see again and nobody's waiting outside. I walked past every cubicle and I was rewarded with a good show. Guess what? A naked man was showering without the door closed! Oh my god... this was sexually arousing. I even captured the moment he rubbed his body in my memory. His butt is also tanned but not as dark as his body complexion. Laugh out loud, it was just within 3 seconds glance and I can gain a lot of information. Amazing. ;)  I then told my friend about it and he went to see. How curious he was! I told him because I want to warn him about it. Not to encourage him to see it. Nevermind then. I then went there again and I saw the guy's "thing"! Luckily he didn't notice me, he was wearing his underwear that time. I was trumatised by his "incredibly" huge thing... it's making me very envy of him. I know he has this very "big" thing, but there's no need to show it off in public like this. But anyway, I enjoyed watching it. Wahahaa... too bad I don't have camera with me. So I can post it here for you guys to see... Hahaha. *Kidding*  So that's how my Sentosa's experience with a unforgetable memories and beautiful ending.
