We played 2 shows... the second of which got far better audience applause than the first. Although... the first had some better parts in the performance, though I'm not saying what they are, you'll have to ask me about that (and why i'm not saying them here).  Chadwina (from the blue man boards) showed up, and she was my guinea pig for the second service, though you can't see it in the video... *sigh*  Oh well.  During the first show, my bald cap cracked, showing that I was a white dood underneath, so I just had to do some impromptu fixin'.  We still seem to have enough blue paint left to do another 3 blue men, which is good. Keith wants me to sell it to him, but I think i'll keep it :) unless... he gives me a REALLY good offer for used greasepaint :-O  I'd... uhh.. like to thank wal-mart for having black sweatpants and shoes during the summer... and... uhh... the sun for sucking ass because its so hot(sarcasm). I'm serious- it was fairly cold outside that day, but I couldn't feel it because of the paint- you just felt the sun's rays going straight into you (much like when you're in an airplane, over the clouds, and the sun is hitting you directly from the window)  "HEHLLO!!! I ARM TEH SUN!!!!11!! WHAT IS YURO  NAM!#!!EE!!!!"  "Fuck you, sun! Owwwww!"  Then... we went to bennigans, where we had a waitress that had a striking resemblance to Drew Barrymore. Bossy, too. Apparentally "The Customer is always right" is unstylish at such a high class place as Bennigans :-P  She was cool though, that was a refreshing change.  Speaking of refreshing, that was probably the most fun at lunch i'd ever had, ever. Nicholas felt the same way.  Heh, my face hurted from taking the makeup off until Monday. Major removal and cloth scraping took place...  The fabric dye on my hands won't come off till... my estimate is Friday. I bet it won't be totally gone until the next monday, when i had mehron on my hands, it took 3 days for it all to get out of my fingernails. And this stuff is the junk you put on Easter Eggs. :-O  But... the scars i had from cat scratches are all blue now X-P  Hmm.. .what else has happened since my major lack of posting occured...  Oh yes, TAKS week. Fucking stupid. Science... when did we learn this stuff? I could have sworn to the non-existant higher power that teachers were supposed to be preparing us for this bullshit. And, when it gets here, if we bomb this information we were never taught, we get fucking remedial classes.  All the smart kids everybody hates (not the nerds, just the ones that are smart to the point that they suck) kept saying "It's common sense!" and I kept saying "The covalent bond of H2Ch3O-fucking-7 ---> 2390rifjsjew388ejddn put into the core of a nucleus at an atom-raping facility is NOT common sense!"  That's all I'm gonna write for tonight, folks. I'm too tired.  G'nite!
