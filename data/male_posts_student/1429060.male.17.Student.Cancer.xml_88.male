Each blow I inflict upon her flows through blood And ends up hitting me in return quote, No Man Is An Island We, she and I Positive and negative Outgoing and introspective just fit sometimes jigsaw fashion.  2 I know that a soul never came I know this because her tummy (that is what we called it back then) would speak a faint, insistent pulse whenever I put my ear to her navel and she would say to me, “can’t you hear the kicking?” I would be excited, and whisper, for fear of waking it up while it still slept “it’s kicking, mommy” but one day the kick ebbed and they held me and told me that it never really came I would never know whether I could train him or sing to her They told me it was a miscarriage mommy, what’s that mean?  3 it always happens around this time just like I expect it to a guest that I never want to come by but that I have no right to scream    have you come back and made me want to  away  hide my face  never look up again or do something so no one will have to suffer me thinking that no one wants to see the smile on my face ever again which I have only stolen back recently and then the guest pulls out  list of what I have done wrong, of course so why don’t I just end it now here		on the kitchen floor no one will care just six   here and there let all of it, all of it out but I made a promise not to.  4 Don’t talk to me I don’t want to see you right now or her, or him, or anybody I just want to curl into a ball and sleep without knowing:  5 i have a secret i have a secret that i know and no one else knows it it’s my secret, and i don’t have to tell it it’s a precious feeling, having a secret a little blue ball between my fingers and no one can know it because it’s all mine i breathed on it today it rose up and embraced me for i found out that i could cry and the secret can only be whispered when no one is watching so i won’t say my secret unless i say it to Her i would give my secret to Her, so she would know it and then we would have a pair of secrets the two of us hummingbirds that travel in pairs humming because they know something and they know that no one else knows blue hummingbird i hold Her in my palms.   Sorry I am not blogging frequently anymore.
