I really wanted to see 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' again too.  Since I had my day off, I began cleaning for my mom, who has agreed to pay me $10 per hour to clean the house. I split it with Drew so it was supposed to clean for an hour and a half but my house was so messy that I just kept doing it for about five hours. So, go me, I made money on my day off!  After cleaning, I watched a couple hours of 'The Surreal Life' for the first time. It wasn't that funny nor was it that interesting, so I'm still not entirely sure what possessed me to watch it for so long.  I turned on the TV downstairs and got on the laptop and 'Friends' was on. It was the episode where Phoebe got married. It was one of the more unrealistic episodes, but I was glad to see it as it felt like Phoebe deserved to get married to someone. I'm a bit confused as to whether or not they reshow the whole seasons during the summer, because I would've thought this episode would have been on later.  Now that I've seen some 'Friends' tonight, I'll probably go watch the DVDs in my room. I watch them when I'm sad or when I'm in a good mood and want to feel even better. Is it pitiful that I honestly feel like they're my best friends? I could watch that show over and over and over again, and I feel close to the characters.  I'm weird, I suppose.
