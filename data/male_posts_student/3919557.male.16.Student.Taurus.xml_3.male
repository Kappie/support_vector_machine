Sarah and I were hott and stayed at her house.  It was nice, I slept really good.   The next day I worked and then went back to the camp.  Sarah, Alecia, Ryan, Leslie, Monica and I all played Dutch Blitz.  It was so much fun.  That game is awesome.  The next day all of us went to our church service outside.  It was alright.  Sarah was really moved by the reading of Autum's poems.  After that I had the best rasberry pie ever.  It was so good.  I can't stop talking about it.  I think the pie was the best part of my day.  Today not much happened. Guess what I did...work! I know thats suprising.  It seems like all I ever do is work.  I hate it.  But hey it is nice to have money.  I am pumped for the disney marathon coming up.  Sarah, Alecia, Ryan and I are all have a disney movie marathon.  We are only watching the classics.  Old school disney.  Well I think I am going to go.
