I've been walking around like a little kid in a candy store drooling all over the place.   So I bought me a new game yesterday.  Its called Breakdown and its for the xbox.  Not a bad game so far. I played it for a few hours yesterday and I got into it.  Im sure ill waste countless hours of my life on the damn thing just like I do all the time.  What can I say, I'm definately a gamer.  Well peace out for now.
