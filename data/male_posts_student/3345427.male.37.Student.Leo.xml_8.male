Peter has drained two bank accounts and made arrangements to go to New York  City to see some shows, knowing full well, we have a $1000.00 cad tuition bill due the CC is maxed out and hes left me with $100.00 for the next 5 days. He says he needs this trip, and it's all about him. So be it. ************************************************************************   I am so tired of being alone, in a house built for two. This mental disease is far greater a problem than i had anticipated. My friend Clay came up last weekend and all Peter did  was sleep and mope around the house, which agitated several heated confrontations infront of our guest. Then Peter had a massive emotional breakdown on Sunday Night, which did not help things. **************************************************************************  what am I supposed to do now. And Where am i to get the emotional, physical and sexual contact that I so crave tonight? where do I get the "all about me" feeling. where do I  go from here? I have no fucking clue. Peter leaves on a midnight bus to NYC and I am damn not gonna babysit him in the terminal for 2 hours before his bus. No way in hell. This is his trip and thats what he told me - so he can go on his own, and come back on h is own.  I just cannot bring myself to see him off, knowing that he is leaving me alone. without a clue where I stand, and when it will be my turn to get what I need.  ****************************************************************************   I am tired of giving and giving and putting up with this mental "masterbation" that I get every day. Oh I have mental problems, so I cannot do anything. OH i am so tired and weak  and i am not going to respond to you - BUT if you give me $500.00 Cad I will go to new york, see some shows and be better for the trip. but FUCK YOU while you wait. this is insanity. he promises that when  he comes back he will be accountable. well " the check  is in the mail as well....." i am in way too deep. ******************************************************************************   Where do you draw the line on what is enough??? I have had enough. What about ME? who is going to take care of me? Who is going to see me through this weekend? How am I going to  cope with all this insanity??? I don't know how I am going to deal with this.  ******************************************************************************   Where do you draw the line between empathy for mental disease, the excuse of the disease  as a problem, therefore I will not or cannot try to change, and where do you say OK get  off your fucking ass and pay me some attention and make me feel like I am important. *******************************************************************************   This is killing me slowly... killing me emotionally, killing me sexually and killing me spiritually. I don't need this .. HIV is taking me slowly as it is, it does not need any help. I am so trying to stay above the water here. I just don't know where to turn.
