Don't ask me what it's about, I hav'evnt the slightest of clues, but being my first movie, I thought I should mention it. Secondly, my second ever movie, Aliens (the 2nd one with the marines in it). What a cool movie. I mean, come on, Aliens, marines, cool, space age guns, what could be better? I remember having dreams where I was in my grand parents house (because thats where I'd allways watch the movie) and I would have one of those neato "pulse action riffles" from the movie, and I'd be running around killing aliens. What a great movie, so great, in fact, that I am seing Aliens Versus Predators on Friday.. What fun! And Finally, the mother of all movies "Ghostbusters!" Simply a classic. Whether it's the first or the second, it all kicks ass. They even had a computer game, back when computers still hooked up to tv's. Man was that a fun game, you got to pick your car, and your equip, and run around the city fighting the stay-puffed marshmellow man.. Alright, those are my thoughts for the day, no newspaper, so no new anti-Kerry rants. That'l be another day.. Adios..
