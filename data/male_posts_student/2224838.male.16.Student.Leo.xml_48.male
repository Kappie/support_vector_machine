It seems that everyone whose views actually matter to me have said that this film is simply awesome. Here is a little sample of what some prominent figures have said:  If ever there was a film with the correct title, that film is Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ.' ... It is the most violent film I have ever seen.   - Roger Ebert , in  urlLink his review      It is a powerful and important film, helmed by a man with a sincere heart and a warrior's sense of justice. It is a story filled with searing images and ultimately a message of redemption and hope. ... It also might just be the greatest cinematic version of the greatest story ever told.    - Richard Roeper , in  urlLink his commentary     "Gibson's movie is not for everybody.  But if you see it, you may wonder why Gibson himself has been so brutally attacked. His apparent sin is being faithful to the gospels and wanting people to imitate the compassionate philosophy of Jesus. Now if that's a bad thing, we have truly lost our way."   - Bill O'Reilly , in  urlLink his talking points     From what I gather, this should be a very significant film; one which I am very interested in seeing. As for my thoughts, I simply recommend that those who are interested in the movie go see it and form a personal opinion.
