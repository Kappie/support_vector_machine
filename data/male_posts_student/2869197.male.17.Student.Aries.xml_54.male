Natural geeks are drawn to "geek groups" which rub off on them, making them more geeky. It's cyclic. Geek clubs are the whetting stone we sharpen our geekiness into a razor, so as to better stab the heart of normality. I found it funny when a self-proclaimed "band geek" said that a nonband geek placed in a group of band geeks would be very confused and frightened. This phenomena is not limited to band. Throw some "normy" into a bunch of Debater geeks and he'll be mentally pummelled. Heideggerian kritik discussion alone would push that poor sap over the edge. In fact, I think all geek clubs would have that effect on a normy, similar to the effect on a geek thrown into a football lockeroom. We're mutually destructive, like matter and anti-matter.  I am officially a member of NHS now. Strange, no cultic rights, no blood-drawn pentagrams. Actually, I think the choir was a little gutsy in their choice of a Christian song for the induction. Honorable, but gutsy. Being in the National  Honors  Society brings up questions of humility. I'm thinking about running for an office, but so many others are running, it may be best to simply be a self-volunteered guide on the sidelines.
