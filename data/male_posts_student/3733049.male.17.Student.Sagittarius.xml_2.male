This is because the music industry has held on to a process of making less than adequate rock albums with a predictable structure to it (start off with two or three quick guitar snapping, drum thumping songs that scream for attention; then slow it down with a few acoustic songs and finish with the worst track of the album). Due to this, contemporary rock music can be summed up in one word: bland. However, daring to breathe fresh air into the rock music scene comes Brand New; a band from the suburbia wasteland of Long Island, New York who with their sophomore album, Deja Entendu, are reanimating contemporary rock.  	 One aspect that can easily be identified with this album is the influential use of bass very early. In many instances, bass lines are used to support roaring guitar chords but Brand New uses the bass effectively. In some instances using it as the foundation to some songs such as in Sic Transit Gloria…Glory Fades where the bass becomes the centerpiece for the entire song. The most appealing part of Deja Entendu is their confessional tone and witty lyrics. Singer Jesse Lacey attempts to stray away from the typical distressed love song in Good to Know That If I Ever Need Attention…where he sings that “You constantly make it impossible to make conversation, keep us comatose but audible.” Lacey also maintains his cathartic lyrics throughout the album, especially in Guernica and fan favorite, The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows.  	 With Deja Entendu, Brand New has left rock fans optimistic to the future of rock music. If there is a drawback to this album it is that with only eleven tracks Brand New is leaving fans yearning for more. Hopefully, they will develop their next album to be as good, if not better than Deja Entendu. I would recommend if you are a rock music fan who has grown weary of the repetitive garbage thrown at you from record labels that you buy a copy of Brand New’s Deja Entendu immediately.
