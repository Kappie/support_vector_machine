And even though Horrigan would never go for it, it would make an awesome play. Seriously, it'd be cheap as hell too. Costumes, makeup, lights and some props. No sets. No Backdrops. No Special Effects. And if we don't do them here, I'd absolutely love to do one or two at the CPC Talent Show. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
