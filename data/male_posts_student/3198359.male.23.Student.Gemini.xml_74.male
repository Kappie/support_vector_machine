Running Office 2004 at a reasonable speed, resonably reponsive under a heavy load, everything I've always wanted.    Well, in the next two months I might upgrade the hard disk to something like a 60gig 5400rpm with 8MB Cache, oh, and buy an external DVD-R/+R/etc drive, which will be neat on both the eMac and iBook.
