I spend a few days before x-mas to take a tour of west texas stopping in little towns that house family of my girl and i.  that was nice, i got a chance to see some family that i havn't seen in about two years, like uncles, cousins and such.  on the day after x-mas i spend holding it down at ssg.  mimi was off work on thursday and we really didn't do anything but hang around the house, hell thats all i've done for the past 4 days, it seems.  glued to the tv playing grand theft auto 3 on the playstation 2 to that mimi bought for me.  i went to a show on friday night, that was a highlight.  i saw a few people that i hadn't seening in a while, all the bands were great: el salvador b-day bash, ...of death, kill the slavemaster, and since by man.  great show.  lots of energy or drunks, can't tell, but it was my first chance to get out my camcorder that mimi bought for me for x-mas.  I owe it to her for sure.  so i have the show on tape and that was fun in itself.  from the desk of john coffman
