I don't think I'll get 66% like I did on the mock one a few weeks ago. But hopefully I'll get some sort of grade, whether it be an E or a D. Either of those would be good. A C would be great, and I won'g get a B or an A. Then came a very boring 2 and a half hours, in which me and nonnesuch sat in the hall, talking, reading the paper, and doing minimal business revision. A while later, we wandered to the library, and I read 'The Empty Grave' a terrible horror story I finished in about 10 minutes, including looking at the pictures. :) The story was terrible. The business exam was quite easy, mainly about a sole trader, which is about the most basic thing in business. And it only lasted an hour, but I had a little time to check it, unlike maths where I barely started the last question. But still, only 5 exams left. Physics tomorrow morning, chemistry extension wednesday afternoon, physics extension and statistics foundation on friday, and the last business on monday. One week today. In one week, I will be all finished. I will make a point of blogging at this time next week, to let off some of my excitement. Remind me, won't you, if you see me on MSN in exactly one week. Poor  urlLink dickybod , who has a media exam on wednesday week, 2 days after my last exam. I'll try not to taunt him too much on MSN Monday evening... well, maybe a little... :)  In other news, today be the longest day of the year. Which isn't particually exciting. Not at all exciting. In fact, not really different from any other day, so boring as hell. We get a few minutes more daylight than yesterday, and a few minutes less (if that) than tomorrow. What fun. Apparently loads of people gathered at stone henge this morning to see the sun rise on the equinox. Can't think why... Anyway, here's a random picture of stone henge. Looks quite nice, I think.
