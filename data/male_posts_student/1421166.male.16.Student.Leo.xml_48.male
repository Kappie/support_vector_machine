Well, will be less frequent here cause I'll be exceeding my download value soon. But do come back guys, and leave notes too! (if there's anything to say of course). Alright, I won't be going to Australia anymore, at least I have a year to decide. And either way, I might not be able to differ NS back in S'pore. So the good news is that the great guy is staying!!! oops...just kidding! Well, at least I no longer need to make that tough tough decision. I'm happy now, everything's back to normal, my relationship with people and stuff, even bac to the norm of rushing homework...haha! But that isn't exactly enjoyable. I slept through the day. So guess, I'd better do abit of homework tonight. And Dustin's back!!! Yeah man...kinda forgot to say...HAPPY BELATED B'DAE DUSTIN! Sorry, it's so late. Well, see you(Dustin) soon. I'd like to thank all who have been there for me. Thank you!!! Anyway, sorry Yen, can't find my poem, maybe I'll write another sometime. Ok...time for dinner. Thanks everyone for visiting!!!
