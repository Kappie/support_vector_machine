I just cant imagine the percentage in India.  Now, am not biased enuf to say it is completely useless. Surely, am a free market guy, hence more competition, better services.. literally.:)  but the problem i have is, there is absolutely no control over these drugs and 'docs'.   The MCI keeps a tight collar around Allopathic practitioners, but these alternative docs are literally free. There is no central testing authority that conducts analysis of their outrageous miracle cures. If anyone who cares to watch their shows on almost all tamil channels, miracle healers have cropped up like a locust storm. They cure anything and everything that affects mankind. All diseases A-Z. They advertise themselves as one stop multi specialty health care centers. I wonder when will ppl realize this is utter nonsense, at least that one man cant be a specialist in everything. Cmon, he cant treat brain tumours and at the same time treat psoriasis and other utterly unrelated diseases. And yet, none of the TVs which broadcast these shows seem to have the sense or responsibility towards society.  Prayer and Religion in Healthcare is acceptable, that too only to an extent as long as it doesnt interfere with treatment and recuperation. They have strong psychological effects on humans, a placebo of sorts.  But this alternative stuff, how many AM medicine docs will advise a patient to get off 'english' anti-hypertensive medicines and go for kuligais and potions they concoct? And will someone sane enuf do that? Yes, doctors in allopathy, do recommend some herbal alternatives. But thats not done word-of-mouth style. These recommendations are based after objective analysis of data derived from experiments.  Another thing u must notice is how the material is presented. I havent seen till now one AM doc on TV how his treatment actually works. Very Strange indeed. If they are so sure of their record, why not publish it or announce in TV, on how exactly their medicine acts. What they think is the disease's cause and what exactly are they doing by prescribing certain diets/pills etc and how these medications help in relieving the patient? To put it bluntly, Mechanism of Action. Everyone just claims, they cure this and they cure that. And i go yawn....... havent heard that one before.   Even funnier, Most of these docs actually have balls to criticise Allopathy when they cant say with a straight face on what their treatment entails. Sometimes, they give out such misleading information which can result in only one thing, filling of their pockets. Theres one idiot from Salem with a serious 'holier-than-thou' complex, and he considers himself a seventh generation sexologist. Self appointed of course. He declares he is there to give sevai and not for money.and all tamil nattu pongaL are his pongaL. Yeah, right. Wonder, how these idiots were allowed to live for dispensing and creating havoc among the sexually illiterate youth of TN. I watched the other day with seething anger, almost to the point of 'nothing can be done' frustration, when he was blabbing about impotency. By Gosh, u need to be imaginative seriously to come up with reasons like he does. Utter incompetent fool with apparently minimal knowledge on human reproductive system, and he is proud to come on TV. Best is, his service is so essential, he goes to every town in TN to give sevai.   Another major buffoon is this guy from Chennai. He claims to have heritage of asthana vaidya salai for some royal household.  Please have a look at his roster of services. Let us ignore the spelling errors, though I have a doubt that he doesnt really know or care, as long as words sound scary. Coz his TV prog also consistently mis-spells and this continues here too in his website.
