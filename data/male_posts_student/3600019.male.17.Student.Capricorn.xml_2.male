I was in such a dilemma that I actually decided to take out the dictionary and settle on any word that is appealing to me and I still cant find any!( So suay!) Yes Yes Yes. I noe I noe. I'm dumb.... "Perception-of-love" that's the nick I'm going to settle on before I find any better nick to settle on. It is now time for me to use my pig brain to figure out how to use all the settings. It is just so irritating!
