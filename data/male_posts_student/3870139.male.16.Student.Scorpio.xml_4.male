Showing up masks to hide my weaknesses. Hard to show up what is the real me. Frighted to let others know who am i for real. Don't take it as badly as you feel now. I'm not fooling you that way. I'm just being precautious of showing up my personality to everyone. Reasons? Yeah... I really mean things for the reason. Hard for me to say but need to give a clincher as a must. Well, it is my experience who gave me the cause for this practice. That way you might understand me. Hope so, well don't take this seriously, it's part of my collection of mask. Got you again.
