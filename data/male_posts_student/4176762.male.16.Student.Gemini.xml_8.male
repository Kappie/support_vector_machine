Attended a laptop training program, me in a laptop training program, yeah I know.  It was sooo boring, sitting there with like 50 some odd 7th graders watching them trying to get their IBMs working.  Afterwards my mom was convinced I needed some nice clothes for school and went on a shopping spree at Dillard's.  I, on the other hand, was convinced I needed Alien vs. Predator 2 for Mac, so I stopped by the Apple store and picked it up.  I also learned that instead of wasting time shipping off my messed up iPod to California, I can just bring it to the store and they will fix it.  Cool, huh?  After setting up the game I had to go to Taekwondo.  It was fun, the kickboxing was normal, then I tought some n00bs who showed up that day, then my mom handed be control of the color belts (and one black belt).  Hehehehe, this was fun.  I started by showing them a neat kick combo, then did speed kick drills.  Push-ups inbetween the kick rotations, of course.  Then RIGHT before class ended, when everyone was complaining that they were tired I had them do machine gun kicks up and down the floor. I have so much fun when I teach. On a serious note, I should have given Brittany, Walker and Ricky more push-ups to do, they always act up in class. I made a mental note to not let it happen again.  Thats the problem with working out at the YMCA, people forget that we are in class b/c we're not in a dojhang. Friday is gonna be awesome though.  I have to wake up early, Leethar is picking me up and brining me to a school thing, then we head to his house for an AvP2 LAN party, then to top it all off, we have tickets for Alien vs. Predator at the Paradiso, on the really BIG screen.  Hopefully some people from the forum will show up.  Well, I actually got to go get some sleep now, got to wake up WAY too early. Until next time.  PS- I picked up the awesome manga called Sgt. Frog, everyone should go buy a copy!
