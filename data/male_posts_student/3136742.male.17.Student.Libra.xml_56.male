Hemingway reminds me of Tarantino in a few ways), and I've been thinking (maybe if you've read the book you'll know what I'm talking about); Robert Jordan and Maria basically fall openly inlove almost immediately upon meeting eachother. Realistically, did/does love ever happen that way? We are led to believe that in the past that's really how it used to happen. People just met, at the right place and time, and telepathically consented to love each other until they both die. And they did! And it was genuine!... I don't think I buy it though...How can you love someone you've just met? What is the foundation of the relationship? Can you love someone regardless of their personality, their intellect, and must it have been looks that attracted you to them in the first place? Suppose you're too different, or maybe worse, too similar? Or is it really possible in the first place.... Are they the responsibilities of a love that died at the birth of the information age? Can two people who want different things love each other respectively, realistically, giving each what the other wants? Is it a positive plus negative thing-- yin and yang-- must there be balance? Or, must the scales be tipped?... I guess that would be true unconditional love, but do I believe in that? Does it really exist?... Do I even care? Fuck... I'm not even 100 pages into the book yet. I shouldn't be thinking so much. I just got the urge to watch old nickelodeon shows, like Pete  Pete. I don't know why... I want that "Noggin" channel. NP; Lenny Breau and Chet Atkins
