This is an unusual agreement seeing as I have always viewed myself as one being not mind and body separate.  This is starting to change as of late though.  It's when my body is exhausted and my mind is clear that these things start to become known.  If my life could combine itself to work together things would be much more recognizable as a simple understanding of being.  Ohh well life is like this as Avril Levine would say.  You know how I love quoting the great mins of our time.  I'm off to read some Kerouac and try to get the team back together again.  Who knows what will work but if  anything it will be fulfilling..   Later Folks..
