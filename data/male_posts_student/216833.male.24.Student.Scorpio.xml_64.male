After getting lost somewhere around Eagle Mt. Lake, first stopping at Grapevine Lake, I found myself far from home and pissed off. Of course, I could have told you the probability of finding an empty campsite. The drive was fun. We took tons of obscure farm roads and small curvy roads with big trees. It was a really nice drive.   Stopped by my parents house and said hello to them. I think they are doing ok, never can tell anymore.  Got home about 9pm and watched some tv - now I'm off to bed.
