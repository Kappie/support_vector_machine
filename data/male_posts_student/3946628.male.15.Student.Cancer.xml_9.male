Well lets get started, well yesturday I went down to 1 Normal Plaza to play hockey with a few guys that he knew...but when we got there they had just finished painting some of the rink, so we went out there, it was dry and was fine to play on and all, we think that a lot of guys didnt come because they thought that the rink would be closed...so my dad, frank (one of my dad's friends), and I all got there and started messing around for a little bit, I fell on some dust and leaves and shit and cut my elbow really bad, oh well I got another one... but we had been there for about 20 minutes then another guy showed up, we didnt know him, his name was dan too, kind of weird?!?! but then a few other older guys that my dad knew showed up a little after him...well that was pretty fun, the other dan was really good, pretty fun watching him skate and all, but he was about the only other person that was any good...so thats about all I did yesturday but today was so exciting!!! Omg it started off, you wont believe this, but I did my paper route!!! yea I know amazing eh??? Well then I just went back to bed, talked to tasha, took the dog out, talked to tasha, ate, talked to tasha, really just the same ol stuff, then went to weight lifting and just played racketball and a little basketball the whole time, it was fun and then I came back here and finished my most recent mod to my pc...I'll post a pic a little later...but Im gonna go now, gettina lil hungry...but whatever, I'll prolly right in here tomoro cause Tasha is leavin for Florida...Ima be so freakin bored!!!!
