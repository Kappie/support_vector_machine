It was also the final time I got to see the seniors, some I am proud to call my friends, some I wish I got to know better, and some I never met before in my life. Still it's sad that they are gone.The gig overall went well. Suprisingly some people were listening as we played Pirates of the Caribean in prelude. 7-8 run throughs of Pomp and Circumstance, and Aeidu. Saw some of my teachers...(including ones I have stuff due tomorrow..and of course I haven't done it yet eek!) Said goodbye to some seniors. and there goes about 6 hours of my day.  I'm tired
