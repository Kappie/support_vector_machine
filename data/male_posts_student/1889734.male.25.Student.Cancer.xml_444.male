This photo doesn't mean anything, yet the crackpots at Newsmax are going to tout it non-stop for the next few weeks.    Now, I've heard reports that Kerry accused American soldiers of atrocitites in Viet Nam, and later admitted that he never actually witnessed the things he claimed.  If there is confirmation of that, then we have a much more damning story than him attending a rally.  Hell, I probably would have attended the rally if it was in my area, just to see what the freaks were up to.    But Newsmax is going too far, as usual.
