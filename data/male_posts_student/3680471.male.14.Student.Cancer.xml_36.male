Then Alaina left (sad isnt it) and me britt made cookies, giant cookies to be exact. I ate one. Then went to Taco Bell. Yummy. We came back and I was pressure washing my aunts driveway. It ran outta gas so I filled it up and then was starting it. I put my hand on the engine and burnt it real bad. Thats the worst pain I ever felt. I had to keep it in water all day. I watched Top Gun though. Great movie. Then Alaina called me like at 11:30. We talked till twelve. Heh. Then I went to bed. Now Good Bye. And have a great day.
