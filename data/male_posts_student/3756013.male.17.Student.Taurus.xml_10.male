And I seriously hate the fact that the Governmanet want to leagalize it... In a responce to joys journal a person wrote "Ever hear of seperation of church and state?" Well, in my opinion seperationg of church and state is a bunch on nonsence. This country was founded on the principals of christian believes and i hate when i hear people bitching about saying the word "God" in the plege or in school or anything to do wiht our government. Wehn a president gets sworn into offince he hold his hand on the Bible and says an oath, same thing in court. Is that now wrong too? I hate this Bull about seperation of church and state. Now back to the gay subject. The bible falt out says Homosexuality is a sin, "Do not practice homosexuality; it is a detestable sin" Leviticus 18:22. You can also find it in Romans 1:18-32 and in 1 Corithians 6:9-10. Now wether you want to say that the bible has its faults and blah blah blah, thats your decision. But it says right htere that it is a sin, and thats what Ill believe.    "We take his name out of schools   Lawyers say it breaks the rules   Pledge of Alligence cant me read   And 'Under God' should not be said  I wounder how much he will take,   I just pray its not to late     What if God quit trying?   He just turned away   If there were tear drops on his face   Tell me how would you feel,   youd prally give up too   If nobody believed in you"   ~Joe Nicholes
