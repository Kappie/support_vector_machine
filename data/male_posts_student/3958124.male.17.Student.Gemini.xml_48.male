I really had a blast with her and the other limo riders.  The music at the prom was about a 7 out of 10, mostly because a bunch of the songs were new at the first dance I went to in 7th grade. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.   Some folks told me today that they really liked the Cici story, so I'll dust off a few oldies for yeh.  Mr. Mahoney, the wanker science teacher, was trying to explain how atoms with a greater atomic number are more unstable than atoms like Hydrogen, Helium, or even Oxygen, that have a low atomic number. He could have said this: "High numbered, heavy elements like Uranium can't hold their 235 electrons very well. The electrons are spinning very fast.  The outer most electrons are not as close to the center as the others are and therefore do not receive as much pull from the protons in the nucleus." Instead, he chose to treat us like we were stupid. "Unstable atoms are like  urlLink Michelle Kwan ," he started, producing mild giggling. "No, no! Just listen! When she is spinning really fast, she puts her arms really close to the inside, and she doesn't fall over. Just like an atom, right?" At this point, the wiener looked at us, smiling. Like a big dumb dog.  "But then when she, uh, you know, opens her arms, she slows down and, uh, moves lower to the ground..." Just like an atom, huh?  Another time, he was trying to explain the electron shell levels of atoms. He started off in the same stupid way, attempting to form an analogy that was completely... well... retarded. "Electrons can't just jump from shell to shell, okay?" Most of us knew this, but those who didn't were stoned anyway. "It's just like how you can't jump from the bottom set of stairs to the top-" This is where I jumped in - Kali you might remember this. "Siping could!" "No, he couldn't," Mr. Mahoney tried to recover. No one was listening to him, so we probably just sat around and did nothing for the rest of the class, like usual.   Less reminiscing, sooner.
