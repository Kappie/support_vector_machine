WTF. + got to go to heather's birthday party today. eugene...haha...i hope you don't talk to all girls like that. + coach's assumption that we can't do duties: look at how many tasks he gives to the captains. survey, ranking, training, one-on-one meetings... + my cousin got me thinking, reloaded might've been better than revolutions. 100-smith fight, fight in the atrium (haha the janitor v. that cleaning lady), car chase...what did revolutions have? even more talking... + i think you need to move it to the left shorty! move it to the left shorty!  edit 1:39 pm: michelle branch has a  urlLink xanga ? if you read enough posts, it does seem authentic, she says a lot of things that an impersonator probably wouldn't be able to make up. if it really is her, two things: (1) that's pretty damn cool, and (2) wouldn't it be neat if celebrities had decent grammar?
