So got home at like 11am and started getting the car ready and stuff...Wan Chor was following and stuff cause alot of her stuff is still at Tok Mak`s hse in Taiping and bla..So dad drove and I got to sit in front!wee!And I programmed the radios sound to go only to me so even better!We like left at 12pm past and needed or hoped to get there by 4pm so we could give the Kuala Kangsar House keys to the real estate agent..So the car was just serviced and the car was generally quite light and stuff..so the car was quite smooth..at times my dad was going at like 150 kph at times and he didn`t notice..in fact his average was 120 or 130kph..and even at 150 kph mad drivers are still tail gating..crazy..So got there in time!Didn`t even take 3hours to get to the place..then went for lunch at Yut Sun.  Then went to the house and stuff..and took down the curtains and bla..god..the hse is so dusty and so termitish...hehe I know have lotsa small change :p.  So stayed up til like 5am to watch Czech Republic take on Holland..I bet with Afandi 10bucks..after 19mins Holland up 2-0..I was dancing all over the place but the Czechs who is one of my favourites to win the whole thing proved their dark horseness and took advantage of Phillip Cocu`s horrendous mistake and dumb tactical changes and an opponent getting sent off..babi I owe him rm50 now :p..shit it was damn scary..all sorts of noises through out the house..walked around to see what was the noises but there was ..gulp..nothing!I was already planning to take some of those knives on the table and arm myself and attack anything except my family of course :p..Maybe it was mice that made all those noises?I dunno..but it was s a c a r y !  So then woke up at like 10am..did more stuff..then went out with dad to get garbage bags and drinks...and some bastard took our parking space so I yelled 'BASTARD' at the guy when he was exiting his car..Serves the fucker right..people were staring even..lol..then got the stuff..  Then went back to the house and like got all the damn stuff ready..bathed and I had to get the 'For Sale' sign off the fence!And I heard that there was a snake at the house before but didn`t know wether if it was inside or outside the house so like I tip toed across the grass and jumped on the fence and inched along the thing holding it up and what not...then had to spend like half a minute trying to rip the sign off..thankfully dman windy..heh and I had sunglasses on baby :D..then I ran across the grass faster than I had ran lately...no snake though but why take the risk?If there was a snake,id grab the sulfur on the floor and throw it at it and say "EAT SOME SULFUR BITCH!!!" and runaway..hehe..  So got all the motherfishing stuff in the car and left for Kuala Kangsar..front seat again..yay..dropped by the house...and then ate by the river and what not..then left..  So reached home at like 10pm or so...had nasi kandar from Pelita and slept at 1am..had been sms-sing with Steffi for like the last 24 or so plus hours..I musta sent like 60 or 70 sms with maybe 50 to her hehe ;-)..heh..anyway not much else more for here...ciao ciao..  Riz.
