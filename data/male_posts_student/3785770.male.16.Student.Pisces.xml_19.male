One of the best parts of this game might be the multiplayer its really good shit as long as your in a good server. And the graphics are jaw dropping truly some of the best I have ever seen on any game, but you are going to need a darn good pc if youÂ’re going to try playing it at 1600x1200. But enough said Far Cry is an incredible game and you should get it as soon as you can save up 50 bucks.   urlLink
