The newspaper report was on eating too much slimming pills, thus the girl died due to kidney failure. I was very flustered on that topic...didn't really bring out the points I wanted to. But the second topic was much more easier...about how you deal with the failures in life. I was rambling on and on until the examiner said stop. Oh well....I didn't have too much confidence....oh well.   Me-ow meow! I don't know what to say le.....I will update this blog once my father comes back from getting the pics. See ya.
