Yup, it was like the Filipino weddings in the U.S. with a dozen pair of sponsors, etc... One thing about FilAms is that many of the customs that are parents are familiar with are shared with us wether or not we want them shared. :)  For example, things I won't share (as in I'll kindly not participate in):  * eating balut * eating bitter melon  Saw the art exhibit in Angeles also (it's a block down from the Holy Rosary church). Was very cool. Very nice art. I wrote a hay(na)ku for the curator.  Speaking of hay(na)ku's, I started another blog page for them. You can find them at:   urlLink http://johnaku.blogspot.com   Read an article today about the 'Let's Pretend Campaign.' Was a very good article and very inspiring to say the least. The gist was that let's pretent that we (Filipinos) do live in a first world/developed country, and for one day, pretend that we can achieve what others think we can't. I'll have to keep the article with me and share it with my kababayan when I meet up with them again...
