Haven't worked in 3 months; spent June in Oahu surfing; back and forth to Whistler twice this month to snowboard and party; just returned from Christina Lake and Penticton where I visited friends and family and went sailing for the first time. Going to try and lay low for the next week before heading back to Alberta for a wedding, wakeboarding and more partying. At some point I need to try and find a part time job before I start school in September. More to come soon asI sort through everything that's happened in the last few months.
