You are not alone. I have a theory that bad films are much more enjoyable than good ones.  Bad movies have always been a part of my life. I was born in 1968 and grew up with great NYC TV shows like Creature Features, Chiller, Science Fiction Theater, and Fright Night. The new edition of  urlLink Famous Monsters of Filmland  was always a good excuse to talk a walk to the newsstand. As a fourth-grader I was in the audience when a critically-panned movie was screened at the  urlLink Library Theater  in  urlLink Warren, PA :  urlLink Star Wars . When I was in seventh grade, I happened to catch a TV interview with the Medved Brothers, who had penned the book  urlLink The Golden Turkey Awards . I quickly acquired the book and made it my goal to see as many of the dreadful films listed. When  urlLink The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film  came out a year or two later, I was in heaven.  I may never have seen  urlLink The English Patient , but I have seen  urlLink The Thing With Two Heads,   urlLink Head,   urlLink Blacula,   urlLink The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,   urlLink Buckaroo Banzai,   urlLink The Warriors,   urlLink The Golden Voyage of Sinbad,  and  urlLink Daleks: Invasion Earth 2150 AD ! (Come to think of it, I probably watched each of those more than a few times!) I still consider the American International Pictures or  urlLink Hammer Films  logo a better stamp of approval for a movie than a dozen critics' effusive endorsements. And don't even get me started on the name  urlLink Roger Corman ...  Last night the posse and I watched  urlLink Flash Gordon . The 1980 version with hammy acting and a silly script. (When one of the Hawkmen gets hit by a laser he says, "Don't worry Flash -- he just winged me!") The version that looks like the producers calculated out exactly to the last penny how much money it would cost to pull the whole concept off and then spent exactly half that amount. The one with the soundtrack by  urlLink Queen . (My favorite track being "Football Fight.") Needless to say, we all loved it.  Is an enjoyable bad movie an oxymoron? I don't think so, provided the movie is bad in a spectacular way. Hollywood churns out plenty of unfunny comedies or boring dramas that can convince any of us to pick up the remote control and switch channels. But an enjoyable bad movie is the one you stop on while channel surfing.  urlLink A 50 foot tall woman?   urlLink Bikers desecrating a church?   urlLink Giant ants menacing Joan Collins?  "Let's see what this is all about..."  I think bad movies have all the enjoyment of good films without requiring all the emotional investment or attention span. I know that sounds terrible, but frankly I watch TV to be entertained, not to reach a state of enlightenment. That's why I read books. You may disagree with me, and that's okay because it's a free country. But if you were sitting in front of the boob tube right now with the 1980 box-office bomb  urlLink Flash Gordon  on one channel and the 1980 Academy Award winning 190-minute historical drama  urlLink Tess  on the other channel, where would you stop the remote? Case closed, I.F. wins.
