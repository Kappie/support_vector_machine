My take on the whole thing:  Advantages for Kerry:  Edwards isn't frightening in the way that Gephardt could be.  For one thing, Edwards has eyebrows and has been known to smile.  Also Edwards has a reputation for being less liberal than Kerry.  This also plays well to the protectionist sentiment currently afoot and might help Kerry in the Midwest and parts of the south.  This particularly might have helped him in places like Michigan and helps to keep Ohio in play.  Disadvantages for Kerry:  This makes people like me no more likely to vote for him.  I have plenty of issues with the Bush presidency but this doesn't address any of them.  In terms of economic policy Edwards has exactly the wrong intuitions--litigate, regulate, and micromanage.  Great ways to make health care unaffordable for instance.  I don't buy the Republican claims that he's unintelligent; after all he is a successful lawyer.  But he isn't all that open to new ideas.  In fact, he sort of reminds me of the current chief executive.  Edwards basically reminds me of a character out of a John Grisham novel.  This isn't good.  Kerry just took a bigger risk than many people are making it out to be.  I'm imagining what GWB would have been like as someone's VP candidate.  The guy just isn't quick in front of cameras.  This is fine, but I'm expecting an "Edwards is stupid" meme to start up at any time now.  Unless only Republicans can be called stupid.
