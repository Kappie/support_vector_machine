In your last presidential bid, I supported your campaign and voted for you because of several different reasons.  I looked around me and saw that our country was doing better financially than it had been in years.  I looked at the record of the man we had in office at the time, and my thought was that Clinton was an obvious improvement over Reagan and Bush, but things in this country could be so much better. I agreed with you that both political parties had too many debts to too many corporations, and that we would be better off with more than two political parties.  With things on the upswing for America, that was the perfect time to begin to try for a more perfect form of government.  I do not regret voting for you, and I believe Al Gore and his campaign managers are solely responsible for their own defeat.  This time, however, things are much different.  I cannot support a campaign that runs a risk of dividing support for any Democrat candidate that has a chance of defeating George W. Bush.  The risks are too great.  I believe that unless we get someone in office that can correct the mistakes of the current administration, and prevent the future disasters of a second term Bush presidency, the issues you fight for are going to become moot, because we will  too busy fighting for our lives and basic civil rights to worry about such niceties as campaign finance reform or multiple party political reform.  I still believe in you and thank you for your hard work over the decades Ralph, but I want your help in this fight, not another distraction.  Please reconsider, and realize that your country still needs your help, just in a different facility. Sincerely, Brian Thomas
