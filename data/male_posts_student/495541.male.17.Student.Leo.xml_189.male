I can't say I'm mad but that's just the way it always feels when the year is over.  These last few days will probably be the longest.  Let's hope the teachers don't give us much homework.  So today was interesting my Dad and I bought a boat.  Here are some pictures.   urlLink      urlLink     The engine doesn't work so we had to pull that out.  Hopefully we'll be able to find a cheap one and we're hoping to get one in there in the next couple weeks so we can go fishing!
