Well the day went like this.   Andrew, Jessika, Kimmy got dropped off at 9 by kimmys mom. Then we went and picked up Eileen, and Toniann in Nautica. Then we all went to the rapidz. We got their around 10:30 and we went on all the slides. In the lazy river we all wrestled. LOl andrew kept getting hurt by me toniann and eileen. Yeh then we came home around 4 and swam in my pool for like and hour. Then kimmy and jessika came over. And andrew went home. Then we all played basketball. Then every1 had to go.  But i stayed home and went to run at about 6:30. Then came home and got ready to go to Red Lobster and then we came home around 10:30. Then i got ready for bed and was pissed off at jordan and went to sleep. And now jordan is lying... Long story tell ya later. Peace Out Christian
