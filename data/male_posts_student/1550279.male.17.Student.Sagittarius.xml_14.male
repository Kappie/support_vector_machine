I remember about 1-2 years ago when this technology was first starting to be advertised by manufacturers, but one of the major problems then was that products made by two different companies were not guaranteed to (and often didn't) work with each other. Just another example of why I think standards are one of the best things that can happen in the tech industry.  The uses for Bluetooth are very impressive even though it is only considered a "wire replacement". Have a laptop and cell phone both enabled with Bluetooth? Instant wireless modem via either GPRS or EDGE. Bluetooth headset? Acts as a speaker on pretty much anything that makes sound.  More and more products on the market are staring to incorporate Bluetooth, and I wouldn't be surprised if eventually every single peripheral is completely wireless via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or some other wireless standard.
