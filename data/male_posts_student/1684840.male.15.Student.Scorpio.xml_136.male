I had a bit of a shock at school when Miss Oakley quoted an opinion I stressed in an older post I made a few days ago.  I didn't know what to think really.  One of the things going through my mind though was: "What the..!  How does she know..!".  I'd just like to say that the comment about her being "a crazy funeral lovin' teacher" was a joke and I think Miss Oakley is a wonderful teacher, although I do feel sorry for her sometimes when kids take advantage of her good nature :(  James got attacked today by Will, which was quite a shock really.  I hope Brannan gets better soon!  We went to see him after school and he came out.  Me, Craig, Chris, James and Sam (eventually came out after being trapped by his crazy possesive girlfriend) played Manhunt with a few other kids.  We did quite well actually, although I was suprised when I saw my dad and the rest of the family in the car waving to me.  I went to investigate this strange phenomena (Mwaha) and was a little taken aback!  Mr. Swaries had left a message for my mum about something and wanted her to phone back tomorrow.  God knows what it is about!  I'm still trying to think.  My dad is going to ring him back tomorrow, because it was ICT, my dads great at it so he knows whats what.  My mums a cool techno pc person too but my dads got a job in the subject so... you get the picture.  Anyways back to the game of Manhunt...  I was about to capture James when I hurtled over a bloody kurb and sprained my ankle; god it wrecked!  It still hurts now and there is a massive lump below my ankle so now it looks like I have got 2 ankles lol.  I hope the injury doesnt get me off school tomorrow because I want to know what this mystery phone call concerning ICT was all about.  Anywho... I'm off to bed now.  Bad girls has finished until August!!  I can't believe it!!  Quote of the day: "I hate to burst the bubbles in ya bath but...!", exclaimed Chris whilst taking a break during Manhunt!
