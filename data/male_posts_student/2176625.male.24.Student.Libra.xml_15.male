I talked to my step mom and she said I can stay with her when I move back until I find my own place. My mom won't let me move back in with her, she said "No, I am not having any boomerang children. If you move back then your sister will thnk it's ok to move back too" I saw Malia at the store, she asked me out tomorrow night. I have not dated in 4 years, and I am nervous.
