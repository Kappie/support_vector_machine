It turns out that she has already planned her own farewell party and  everyone  must bring something for her that will remind her of us. So the entire hackey group (except for Thomas) took 15 minutes of Science to do a digital photo.  We took two photos, actually. On the first one, Lauren gave Samie bunny ears.  Real  mature. Seeing as it was a  digital  image, we saw it instantly, and Samie found out instantly. She then, of course, demanded another shot (it  is  Lousie's farewell gift after all).
