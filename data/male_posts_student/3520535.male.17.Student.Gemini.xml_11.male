But I'd forgotten how much I liked being worked on by the hair stylist. It reminded me of the previous night. I love to have my hair played with. It's so soothing. I loose track of myself in an almost ecstasy of enjoyment, eyes rolling in the back of your head pleasure, and at those moments I wish I could purr. Afterwards I felt like I'd visited a prostitute, but I reminded myself that she also cut my hair. I'm serious - if you want me to do anything, just run your fingers through my hair, and I'm yours.
