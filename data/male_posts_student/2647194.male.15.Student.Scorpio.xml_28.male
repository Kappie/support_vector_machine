There was so much I wish I had done that I didn't get to do, and a few things that I did get to do.  What I did do: 1. Went to orchestra and registered 2. Shot pool 3. Stay up until 1 and sleep until noon. Damn does that feel good.  What I haven't done/didn't do: 1. See Ladykillers 2. See Secret Window 3. See lotr with Amanda 4. Shoot pool more than once 5. Go to the underground at all-yep, I skipped 2 weeks. 6. homework...uh...yeah...::shifty eyes::  What I have to do as of yet: 1. Prepare a song to play at church tommorow 2. Homework...stupid f*cking english...  I did FINALLY get my rear tube replaced after I screwed up the valve by using a hand pump too vigorously. I need a good floor pump for presta valves...so now my white bike's in working order. Time to work on that Orbea without killing it and having to pay for it...(its a rental).  And about that title. I ate dinner at Ciatti's tonight, and I ate enough food for 2 Italians-that's one sh*t load of food, I tell ya. lol. Let's see...: Around 7 breadsticks A very large plate of spaghetti 2 glasses of water 1 root beer 1 large slice of extremely rich cheese cake  And dinner is supposed to be the smallest meal for a bicyclist...I woke up at 11:30 and ate lunch. lol.  Yep, so that's how my week's been. Pretty lazy, not doing a whole lot, staying up until 1 playing starcraft, getting up at 11:00, skipping right to lunch. It's been a good break, but back to school...more like back to HELL (a.k.a. english).  So there you have it. What I've done, what I haven't done, and what I don't want to do at all.  Couldn't find a song because my damn comp is being an ass and won't run another internet explorer window. So here's a little couplet I just wrote that, I hope, does not describe anyone's life.  "Going downhill and I lost the track Going downhill, and I ain't coming back"
