Tomorrow morning I'm going to the cottage until Monday night, so I probably won't have a chance to update the site at all. I'm going to be adding some sort of music section next week to make the site a little bit more interesting. I have a lot of projects due in the next few weeks, but I'm sure that I'll find some time to get some work done on here.  Have a great holiday weekend.
