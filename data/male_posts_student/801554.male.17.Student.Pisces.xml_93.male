Today was fantastically ordinary. Got up, listened to NPR's excellent news quiz, Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me, went to work for a couple hours at the library, got some books for a term paper, picked up a book of Ray Bradbury short stories I hadn't read before, came home, ate dinner (cube steaks and homemade macaroni and cheese) and watched a movie with the family, Bringin' down the House, with Steve Martin and Queen Latifa, which I give  two and a half stars. And so ends my ordinary day transformed into one of the longest sentences I've ever written. Hope you find my hum-drum activity interesting...  /ryan
