Turns out one of my fellow staff members is messing the company around and therefore they require people to work overtime.          With the bus drivers being smacktards at the moment I used this as an excuse of not being able to do any overtime, however one of my fellow Woodlanders is able to get there via the Yorkshire Traction buses and so they know I'm able to do the same :(.           So my mission tonight is to become diseased with something so if anyones got a new virus feel free to pass it this way, maybe i shud eat some frozen roast potatoes, can't be too good for the old stomach.          Anyway tonight I plan on chatting with some mates and going to bed at about 9ish, I got up at 9 this morning, was working at half past, whoooooops!
