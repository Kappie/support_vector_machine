The problem I'm having lately is with the near-total inability of the United States government to sort out its paranoid pipe dreams from reality, particularly as it relates to the Middle East.  It is clear to me that whoever it is that's in charge of making up plausible new security threats to scare small children with has never picked up a history book.  The first thing to happen of course was the "collaboration" between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.  Makes sense, I guess.  He's an Arab, they're Arabs, they're all Sunni Muslims.  The link between them is obvious.  I should never have let my vision become clouded by irrelevancies such as the fact that al-Qaeda's ostensible goal is the destruction of secular regimes and the imposition of Shari`a, whereas Saddam Hussein represents an aggressively secularist police state.  No problem there.  And you know who else is clearly cooperating with al-Qaeda?  Iran.  Muslims are Muslims, right?  In 1997 and 1998 in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda allies the Taliban execute from nine to eleven Iranian diplomats, probably for the sin of subscribing to Shi`ism.  The Taliban are known to have promoted sabotage activities inside Iran at this point.  Long before this, Shah Ismail (1501-24) made Shi`ism the state religion of Iran, thereby differentiating it religiously from the surrounding Sunni areas.  He expanded his boundaries to far west of those of present-day Iran to include some territory which had originally been part of the Sasanian Empire before the Arab Conquest; the population of this region, called "Iraq", is currently majority Arab Shi`ite.  Most contemporary Iranians view the Arab Conquest rather ambivalently;  on one hand it brought them as a nation to their current religious persuasion, on the other the Arabs are viewed as nomadic invaders who demolished an already millenia-old civilization.   This attitude is not new.  The first Arab of note to appear in the  Sh‹hn‹me  of Ferd›si, the Iranian national epic, is the mythical king Azi Dahhag, who had two snakes sprouting out of his shoulders each requiring the fresh brain of one Iranian boy daily for nourishment, and who reigned for one thousand years before being defeated.  The Arab Conquest of the Sasanian Empire was effected by the Arabs' invasion and occupation of the Sasanian capital city,  Ctesiphon.  The city of Ctesiphon had been founded after the Alexandrian conquest in the vicinity of Babylon and served as the capital not only of the Sasanian Dynasty, but also the earlier Parthian Dynasty.  The nearest contemporary city of note to Ctesiphon is Baghdad, whose name is itself indicative of a Persian origin.  So of course it is perfectly natural that the Iranian government would be perfectly happy to provide cooperation and/or safe passage to the cohorts of a group which had in recent memory killed around ten of its diplomats.  Especially if that group is radical in its agitation for a kind of religion which identifies Iran's brand of religion as capitally heretical.  Sure.  And nothing would please the Iranians more than if, by granting these Sunni terrorists free passage, probably even to the city where their ideological forbears murdered the son-in-law and two grandsons of the Prophet, whom Shi`ites regard as the rightful fourth, fifth, and sixth Caliphs of Islam;  I'll bet the Iranians would be tickled pink that a bunch of Wahhabis would get to run around, attempting to assert control over or sabotage or terrorize a region where the majority of the population are members of the same heresy (in the Wahhabi view) as the Iranians themselves.  Yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense.  Because they're all Muslims, you know?  So they must be in it together.  PS The Czar was totally a fuckin' Bolshevik.
