I'm just being sneaky and using the "Hello" program to upload a picture to the Google servers for me so that I can use it as my picture in my profile.  I don't know if that's how the makers of it intended for it to be used, but if they have a problem with it, they can shoot me with the Golden Gun from that James Bond movie.  And we all know that they aren't going to do that.  Anyway, it's past my bedtime.  It was past my bedtime six hours ago.  I think I need to go to bed, but I'm a teenager, so I find myself here yet again, listening to Usher on my music player and typing to all of my imaginary friends.  I never had a chance to type to my imaginary friends when I was little, so I need to take every opportunity I can get now that I can do so.  My foot is asleep.  I never knew it would be like this when I was younger...  when I was more innocent.  I never knew that I would someday be sitting on my grey chair in front of my computer with my left leg scrunched up underneath my whole body.  I thought I would have a great time with both of my feet, but I'm sitting here at 3:54 am with only one functional foot, and I don't know what my life has come to.  I mean, how in the world did I let this happen?  I could have moved my foot so as to keep it from falling asleep.  I could have gotten up to go to the fridge for some soda, and that would have done the trick.  But no.  I did not....
