Finally! we had sport today and we played skittle ball, Le crosse and Terminator 1 and 2 and i Kicked ass! im so great im fabulous im terrific im so incredible away with not using correct spelling and grammar on my Web log! no but really i kicked at sport today with skittle ball i got tons of people out, in le cross i got tons of points and in terminator i was sprinting for the whole time. After sports we had English and i didnt do much work so i have to make up for it at home but the topic of conversation that lesson was interesting. And finally music was ok but im still there as im writing so it might take a dive or something i'll report back later. Yeh it was ok BYE BYE! XXX000 my addoring fans! (unless your a guy).  Thursday 5/8 2004 Chapter 9: Garbo duty!  Today i had garbo duty...thats a good thing incase you don't know. All i have to do is walk around the school talking to your fellow garbo and you miss Periods 3+4 and 5 which in my case were the worst subjects of the day! Maths (BORING!) and Science (BORING!) but i chose to attend Multimedia which is were i am now! so you can tell i dont have to do much work because im just mucking around on the net. When i look around i see degenerates playing video games, disruptors walking and talking and then i turn my head to my right and see all the 8s students who have already finished there work (including me!) and are currently doing whatever they like meanwhile the rest will fail! And our teachers say we muck around too much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gotta go to Tennis see yas all! Friday 6/8 2004 chapter 10: cbf'ed I CBF'ed writing t'day so see ya!  Saturday 7/8 2004 chapter 11: this mays well be chapter 10!  As usual i had to work today and i stacked shelves, worked the register, looked after the baby and chased theives!yawwwwwnnnn! After that I just watched all the games on T.V and i didnt like 2/3 of the results! Carlton def Essendon...exploitive deleted Wallabies def All blacks...YAY! haha Meg and josh kangaroos def Sydney... Bugger! now Essendon slip to 9th! And after that i just watched horror movies on channel 7 they were pretty gruesome and violent but i dont care iv seen worse. It was about a secretive luxury ship for the high society that sails through the ocean with casino's and swimming pools and all kinds of things on board and they sailed over an uncharted part of ocean and something hits the ship from beneath and drinks the fluids out of all the guests. meenwhile a ship of multicultured terrorists is on a small boat filled with nukes and torpedos and they plan to attack the ship. they arrive at the ship and they find an empty ball room with blood all over the floor and all the money is still at the tables so they know its not a robery and then they split up to find everyone. one group finds some survivors in the control room then one group are attacked by the monster and it splats their blood everywhere. They run into a tubey monster and shoot a hole in it and a half devoured comrad squeezes out of it screaming and making gargling noises, then he turns to the side and his brain is popping out of his head and his pus is pouring out of the tubey monster and showers everyone with it...i told you it was gruesome didnt I? and then he collapses then the monster swallows him again and they run. The monster kills them off one by one until there is only 4 left (there was originally 15) but if i told you how the rest of them died you would probably throw up ! they discover that the monster senses people by hearing and they walk really quietly up to the tube and plant a grenade in it and when the grenade went off it attacked itself and they were ablr to escape in one of the dingys and they leave all the bombs on board and when they get far enough away they detonate them! all the monsters yellow pus and blood fly up into the sky and one long tentacle extends straight up into the sky and they all gasp as it reaches upwards about 200 metres. when they get back they discover that it is the reason why the ocean is uncharted and it has been alive for hundreds of years devouring ships full of people and it was a really gross film. see ya!  sunday 8/8 2004 chapter 12: HW...yawwn  I slept in till 12:30 then watched the footy for like 4 hours and then did hw....thats it. oh and i watched "oceans elevin" on channel 9 and then "cobra" after that. yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnn! i think i'll go sleep now.  monday 9/8 2004 chapter 13: Pearsons dictatorship.  Today in sose we had a good laugh as the following events occured: 1: I hid behind a table at the start of the lesson and was told to sit down(thats not the funny part) 2: i was told i wouldn't be able to participate in the class discussion because i coughed too loudly! 3: i was yelled at and told to move because someone who will remane nameless was kicking my chair! 4: i was told that i was going to be awarded 3 strikes and a detention for sitting down next to the heater when she told me to move to the back row (the heater is in the back row) 5:she threatned that she was going to tell mr. Beale that i was vandalising the heater when i hadn't actually come into any physical contact with it! And at the end of the class she held me back and went on about being disruptive and stupid when if she hadn't pointed out all my imaginary mistakes the class wouldn't have been stopped ! afterwards the whole class was laughing at her behind her back and they all said how outrageous her accusations were. so i feel happy that i have people on my side at least. thanx people! bye bye.
