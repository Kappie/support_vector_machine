But yea basically went so Daniel woudlnt' feel odd, but haha i didn't even sit next to him which kinda defeated the prupsoe, and someone who was suppose to make him feel, ionno at least interested kinda ignored him teh whole time.. *cough* steph u could've at least talked to him a lil, he looked lyk he was bored outta his mind.. lol but its aite.. hmm.. well yea after post camp went to Josh's house and just hung out there for a while.
