If the sun were to explode, it would take seven minutes before us earthlings realized it. I have seven minutes.  7  The superhero fell down today. I scraped my knee. Is that my one weakness? My "krypton?" I'm doubtful about that one.  I'm also doubting whether or not I'm a hero after all. Maybe I'm a superVILLIAN! Yes, that certainly would make sense, what with all the maiming, the hurting and the harm-causing.  No, I'm neither hero nor supervillian. Just your typical human jackass.Same weaknesses as everyone else. Same inhibitons, same ambitions, same everything.  6  My faults, my shortcommings, multiply like the blemishes on my face. Pockmarked with multi-faceted fault, I can see the error in my ways.  5  I can't even be happy. In fact, I've reached the point, that "if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me!" mode. I can't even let anybody else be happy. I drag them down to my level.  Perhaps I do not wish to be alone.  No, no I'm just a selfish prick.  Oh, another fault. What great fun this is.  I think I have room for improvement now.  People change, and so must I.  4  That was longer than seven minutes.  Falling down a well I've already fallen into.  Like every alcoholic, over and over again, expecting different results.  Slipping.  Adieu.
