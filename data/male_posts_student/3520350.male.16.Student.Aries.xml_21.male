Anand warned me this would happen, so I guess I was expection this, and however it was quote a shock. and not a pleaseant one at that. But yeah. I guess i'll survivie. I hope vegas will be interesting, and when i come back i might be able to sort all this out, or to totally forget it all! Anand was right, it seems. however I wil lrefuse to admit that until I have conclusive evidence.  If you need to contact me, use the email(which i'll try 2 check) dmitrygr@gmail.com, or call (847)537-0509, when u hear the voice, press 1, and wait. Personal msgs:       Tracy: Ouch! That was cruel! (Anand warned me this would happen - but i didn't listen) Eleonora: Your entertainment for the week:  urlLink http://dmitrygr.palmz.ru/log.php    Josh: RTFM, then Google, and only then ask!   Brett: Hell yeah!   Jackie: The conformists are attacking, run!  Raffi: The new rammstein video is worth the download   everyone else: looks like u were not worth this space. But dont take it personally!
