You can dust it off and try again. -Aaliyah, "Try Again"   this was a really fun month. it starts on the saturday of kassie's birthday party.   Kassie's friend rachel (this really funny girl from scotts valley, who i hung out with in jully...? sometime around then, we anyway, she) had a friend named luigi who came out and was all gay and stuff. well he gave rachel a book and an invite to the party he was having the next week at his (WOOT WOOT) BEACH HOUSE!! so like yeah.. i was thinking about going but they all said he was ugly so i kinda reconsidered..  anoways the party was really fun! we all were playing ddr and then it was like pizza dinner or something.  rachel+ kassie shared a seat and going left there was: stephanie, cali, kayla, cody, jourdain, ellen, kalie, teena, me and monica. well i kinda sat on the edges of both teena and monicas chairs. BAD idea. i almost fell... twice. and i was wearing my nice sweater...  well yeah after presents (wow, there were alotta animal stuff!) we got ready to leave.. and then we left for THE CORN MAZE~!! the ride up kalie and i sang country songs cause kassie's mom really like the western station.   so we get to the maze and like we go in the entrance and this guy tells us aboutthe maze and its all cold and dark and we can hear music from the haunted ranch place and so we like go in and we wander around finding different things and yeah... we end up all getting seperated, me with cody young. cody and i kinda kissed akwardly and yeah.. we continued on and kassie, teena, rachel and all of them jumped out and scared us. but no one was as scared as monica. i felt bad for her... but anyway, i was with her and then the chain saw guy was like somewhere and we ran and it was so scary.  From the windoooow To the kitchen!  Put some hot sauce on that chicken, Damn yo breath is kickin'!  So eventually we got bored with the whole "wandering-around-the-maze" thing and we decided to go str8 to the haunted ranch. now when we got to the entrance it was kinda creepy but it didnt seem scary at all!! teena was scared so since kalie had gone already, her and teena went out of the maze and waited for us at the exit.   in line, the actors (who were in costume), would try to scare us. first it was this vampire lady with big boobs. she scared me and kassie was like "don't worry, he's gay!!" RIGHT when she said that word a bunch of guys turned around and kinda looked at me. they were really cute, but yeah i figured they were red necks or something...  so we waited in line and i would ask all the actors if i could have a hug cause i ain't 'fraid of no ghost *wink* and then we got ready to go in and we annoyed this bunny man. a lot. so we went in the maze.. kayla, kassie, rachel, cali, stephanie, cody and i. everyone else went after us. it was really creepy in the begininng and cody fell and he was like "leave me! leave me!" and i was like "you are not being left behind!" and i piggy backed him thru the rest of the thing.. oo and i met a really cute vampire who was flirting with me and he was REALLY cute in his vampire make up. so we get outta the place after passing this scary girl who looked like she crawled outta a hybrid of the ring and the shining, we got to the CHAIN SAW GUY! and he like chased us it was soooo cooool!! and then we like left and on the way home teena and kalie were talking about the boys that had turned around when kassie called me gay, and kalie was like "they were touching each other and stuff... tottally fruity!"  so yeah.. i called jorden richardson (the jourdain that was with us was different then the other jorden..) and jorden and i talked and yeah... kassies mom dropped me off and teena promised to give me the book on monday at school.   so i got home at 1 and fell asleep pretty fast... on sunday i slept all day.. i was so tired!  monday started with high hopes of the soon to be 4 day weekend. the library was FINALLY reopened after an awesome renovation. and stephen (this guy i met in october) left school do to independed studies. anyway, on wed. night stephen "came out" and by friday the whole school knew so he was pretty pissed at me. but whatever.. he was kinda lame.  OO annie ross's birthday was on thursday! it was so great i got her a monkey and she got a bunch of other shweet presents... oo yeah, mesha and i wore the monkie on our legs and made it look like it was humping us.. :-D annie got these balloons from tanya and while mesha and i were watching her stuff, one of the balloons blew onto the grass and POPPED! and then annie came back and mesh and i were like "noo!! it was the grass!" and annie didnt believe us and so i took the other balloon (she got 2 small ones and a big.. um.. shiny one) and i was like "noo!! the wind popped it!" and i shoved the balloon against the grass and it popped and i was like "like THAT!" and mesha started crackin' up! it was great! HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNIE BANANNIE~  saturday was suzie's SECOND party. in the morning i went shopping with teena and kendra and got some shweet pajamas. i was gonna meet dominic there and get my shirt back but he got their too late and we left. then the PARTAY~ i met some..
