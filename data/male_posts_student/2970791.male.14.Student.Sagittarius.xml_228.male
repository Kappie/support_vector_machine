These guys are all like funky retro garage rocky and thats awesome. Some of you may have heard of there single "take me out" (::cricket:: maybe not...). anyway you guys have to buy the CD, which is self titled. Oh yeah, there also British, this is kinda crapy site becuase the left out all the music but heres there homepage...  urlLink
