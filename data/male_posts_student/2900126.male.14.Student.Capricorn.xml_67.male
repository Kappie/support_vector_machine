Sounds fun, doesn't it? But yeah other than that it's been an action packed day, Sonya and Jonathan aren't friends with Kiara anymore because of something that Joathan and I kept pressuring Sonya to tell us. LinZ is leaving for NY like tomorrow, I think.  Like the only good thing that came out of this day was I got to talk to Sonya  LinZ today, on the phone *ssshhh............I'm on punishment and I can't be on the phone for the rest of the month*  Chichi is coming home in 8 days!!!!!!!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!!! but yeah I'm kinda sleepy and I have to pack for Florida because we leave or Sunday, I think. Should be fun although My aunt and uncle have a dog and he might mess with my allergies *I hope he doesn't, that cute lil' doggie*. My cousin named him Mustaafa, don't ask I had no say in what his name was. I hope some people invent a medincine that can help people that are allergic to pet dander, I really wanna be a veterinarian, that's what I hope my career will be when I get older. But anyway. Love ya'll! I have to save money so I can buy souveniers. ain't that about some crap?
