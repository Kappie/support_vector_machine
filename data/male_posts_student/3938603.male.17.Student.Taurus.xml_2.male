The old house in the corner of my imagination that I've been seduced to explore, and each broken step to its balcony serving as a boundary; this, in my brain, is where I meet my fate. Sadly, this is a slight obstacle in my daily being, but for once I find resolve in progress, and keep pushing further, finding a way through this haunted, reoccuring wall.  And in the dying moments of my struggle, when I stop to collect my pulse and wholest being, I recognize the fatal flaw: That in life we are all imperfect, and I share this loose bond with everyone. So then, I must remind myself to keep striding against the ripping tide of life, and in failure, to try a different strategy, for the prize is always there -- always waiting, always lurking in the dark distance of my soul and always hoping I someday find my way ashore.  Somewhere in a field far off, there alone stands a wildflower, a courageous metaphor of blossoming light, that grows to the silent humming of Mozart in my thoughts. Slowly as I watch it blossom, it finds light, and nurturing and love. It finds the care of another, the perfect pattern of sunny days, and the end of hope, for all hope is truth.  And if this flower never exists, or in the least dies in the storm of my waining patience, I'll know that somewhere in that field of my conscience lied a beautiful seed, and that is worth the snapshot of my life.  All optimism is a product of waiting, and sometime it will eventually fade away. The reason for this , no matter its tear or joy, lies somewhere in the path before me.
