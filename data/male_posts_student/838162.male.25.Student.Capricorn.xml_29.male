This out-of-character response (I mean how many computer geeks are little more than blobs of misshapen protoplasm with large brain cavities, convex enhanced eyesight and with stubby digits which are only used to manipulate computing input devices and finger food) is mainly due to the recent observations that some people have made about my increase in bulk. Ok lah…they said that I was fat. Especially Nigel who makes in a point to, literality,  point  out this fact to me. I keep telling him to cut his nails but no….  Usually I couldn’t care less what people say about my  >. But it is quite intimidating when you are in the gym surrounded by the regulars with nearly prefect bodies. That’s why I don’t use the public gyms but the gym in my club, where the regulars are mainly middle aged and would only intimidate you with they long stories. Another reason is the price of the public gyms, which are just as intimidating as their regulars.  However one benefit of having people around in the gym is that they inspire you to do more than your body would tell you that it would like to do. Example:  ”…7….8….ok think I’ll do just 10 reps for this….9…come on one more….10 yes!, oh wait….that cute girl on the stair-master is looking this way!…11!…huff puff…12!….13…urgghh!…14…ow ow ow...15…ok she just turned away…sigh”    *laughs* may I remind you that I do not speak from experience…well not really. Anyway, I still feel better with a mouse in my hand than a dumbbell. I mean it’s the brains that count not the body right? Yep! I’ll just keep telling myself that.  Any plans for the New Year? I plan to go all out this year, post ORD and all. Any tips let me know.   >
