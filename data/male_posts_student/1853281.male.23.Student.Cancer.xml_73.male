So i am in this intense inner dialogue right now trying to decide if i buy a pack of smokes or not...Can't decide...Does it really matter? In the end i will die anyways....what will quitting smoking really do except prevent me from enjoying two lungfulls of tarry goodness any time i want...FUCK! I want to buy the smokes...i think i will too. I will be in a very smoky coffee shop this afternoon....i have to. D. is going to lend me some movies...I love the fact that i am borrowing foreign movies with a gay theme from a straight middle aged iranian...my life is weird. so, did the pain-a-lates with j dawg last night...it is so hard... though i can do more than when we began...and i don't with i were dead the next day anymore...it is still hard... haven't lost anyweight by the scale(in fact i have gained some) but my clothes are a bit looser. Didn't shave the head last night...didn't trim the hair either....proto-mullet is a little less proto and a little more mullet as every day goes by, and i really don't care...i don't know what to do with the hair. nothing really doing tonight save nightclass... anyways enough babbling
