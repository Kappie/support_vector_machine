It made me feel like John Madden on so many levels. Or maybe a moth... Not sure what that means, but anywayz... In retrospect, I'm not sure if it was a wise decision. Verbal walkthroughs should have been a warning sign. Although, in situations like these, personal experience has led me to vote yes on "striking while the iron is hott". Not doing so extremely dilutes, if not, kills the purpose. Overanalyzing and meticulously weighing the pros and cons of every action leaves little time for anything else because if one does miraculously calculate the answer, they will have certainly forgotten the equation. There will always be an element of risk because you can't be certain about anything involving something (apex of unnecessary vagueness)that in the end, will never be fully understood by anyone. If you wait too long, it WILL collapse in on itself and leave a mess nobody has the patience to clean up. Although I'm getting ahead of myself. I guess what I'm trying to say is that nothing should be left unsaid/done because, as long as you mean it, it deserves to be known because uncertainty is slow death and nobody likes that.       Race cars are fast.     Well, what have we learned...Don't read The Art of War, when really you should be fighting...Ew.no.something else...um. Thinking=Bad.
