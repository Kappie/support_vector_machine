Weekends are the way for the brain to get it's sleep in instead of sitting in on class after class. So you heard it from me and enjoy that Sunday and when Monday comes it goes the slowest yes, but it will go all uphill from there. Go in with a Cheer. Thursday will be my day to shine, Jazz II audition and I know that I will make it but I have nervous habit of bad things when I am under pressure and I get super pressured, but hopefully I can pull through and get it done. Doing extra-curricular activities are a great way to meet people that have a same interest then you and you know that because they are trying the same thing that you are. Give it a shot and if you don't suceed try, and try until you give up and try for something else.
