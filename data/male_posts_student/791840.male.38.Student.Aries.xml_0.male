Hi Big, yes as a matter of fact i have run into this in dealing with my own family's care, I know this is  hard to deal with a physicain in this manner and all i can offer you is this. Do not waste your  time wth him, He is obveously to lazy and uneducated to deal with the fact that add/adhd is real.  Get yourself another physician. you may even want to research the physicians a bit, before you make  a choice. I actually recieved a letter from a physician  at the center concerning one of the kids   that i get in the mornings saying the same darn thing. Yes dealing with people especialy  physicians can make us very angry, I have been struggleing with  a few here for a while you just can not get through. i have learned they are just not worh the  argument.   biganburly   wrote: As many of you know, I recently relocated to Florida.   As part of  getting my life back in order, I found and went to a new primary care  physician.  While discussing my medical history in detail with this  doctor, I brought up my history of ADD.  I was flabbergasted to hear  the doctor respond by saying that he didn't believe that ADD was a  real disorder, but rather one that was created in the late 60's and  early 70's to account for those that just couldn't deal with hard  work and discipline. Further, he said that it took a doctor with real  guts to prescribe a methamphetamine-based stimulant to anyone, let  alone someone who couldn't focus on their responsibilities.  Yes...I was ready to strangle this guy.  Instead, I spent the next 5  minutes rattling of information, research, web addresses and relevant  anecdotes to try and convince this guy that there was more to this  story than his perceptions of laziness.  I don't think I got through.   Anyone else run into this before?  BIG   To unsubscribe from this group, send an email to: ADD_Couch-unsubscribe@yahoogroups.com    Your use of Yahoo!
