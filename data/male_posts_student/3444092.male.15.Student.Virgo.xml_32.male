After that I chilled at the club for most of the day. Then I went and hung out at the Fetsch's house.   After that, I had to go to my cousins graduation party. I dont like my family. I REALLY don't like the white side of my family. Damn crackers (just because I dont like the white side of my family does not mean I dislike all white people. Some of you crackers are really cool.)  DUDE!!! APC, tommorow, San Jose, FUCK YEAH!!!
