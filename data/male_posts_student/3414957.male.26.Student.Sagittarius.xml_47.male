I really enjoy our friendship but I can't deny that I have feelings for this person. I want to find the perfect time to tell this person but the ting is, this person will be moving soon. Man it hurts, I dont want to go through life wondering what if?????? I did that once before and it sucked. If the feelings are not mutual, I will still be happy to be just friends. Tonight is the night I hope I can find a moment alone to tell my feelings.    Hello???? Blog gods???? Help me out with this one!!!!
