By definition, humans can't be objective. We have too many emotions which affect our judgment.    However, this isn’t the be-all, end-all disclaimer some people would like. Although it is impossible to be completely objective, one should try to remain as objective as possible, particularly when writing for an audience of millions.    This means that all facts have to be taken into considerations constantly. Being objective to a point, then making up your mind and refusing to change your ideas based on new information isn’t objectivity.    That said, it is my solemn promise to those of you who waste your life reading this site that in all my political writings, just as in all my other writings, I will try my best to be objective. At every opportunity I can I will point out both the positives and negatives to any situation where I can see both, and if I miss something, please, feel free to email me or post a comment.    I’m not trying to change anyone’s mind, make money, or control the fate of the world vicariously through my readers. I’m not trying to tell you what’s right and what’s wrong. I’m trying only to entertain and occasionally educate people. And, just maybe, make a few friends.
