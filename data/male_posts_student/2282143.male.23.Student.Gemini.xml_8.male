I shouldn't laugh cause if it was me, well, lets just say they probably couldn't air all the violence, profanity, and all around chaos I would cause.  Heartbreak sucks, and I don't wish it upon anyone.  I think I was laughing more at the way TV has trivialized emotions.  I mean, this was a very private moment between people that has just been viewed by millions.  Ouch.  That and Bob gave Stella a promise ring... the fucking pansy...  go all out or go home.   None of that 'promise' stuff.  Besides, when you get someone a diamond promise ring, do you get to propose with the same ring?  Kill two birds with one stone, almost literally.  "Hey baby, this is gonna be yours if I end up actually loving you!"  I also think its funny that Bob got to be a man-whore with all these other women and now she gets to watch it.  Nothing says I love you like making out with other people!  I guess I just don't understand reality television.  Perhaps I would like to keep it that way.  There is something wrong with us when we find pleasure in trifling with other's emotions.  Especially complete strangers.  Ever watch Joe Schmo?  Yeah, now THAT was funny...  Speaking of funny and laughing at other people's pain, watch MXC:  Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.  Man, those Japanese are funny people.  Why can't we do stuff like that in the US?  Liability?  Ok, question for you all.  If someone tells you something really exciting and you tell someone else before the original person tells the person you told, is it wrong of you?  Especially if there was no mention that you couldnt tell other people?  I mean, it wasnt a rumor, it wasnt a lie, it was actually a very cool thing... Well, whatever...  Class was fun tonight.  Me, John, and Smelly Todd.  Bunch of kids too.  Todd is still kinda weird.  He tries to imitate the moves I do on him and he tries to do them much harder to me.  Poor kid.  I still hold back on him.  I dont think he is ready yet for a real sparring match.  Only me and John were after class though, working on staff.  It was awesome.  He complimented me for being here for so long and my progression, and I was really proud because he NEVER compliments anyone.  So that was cool.  I guess tonight was better than I thought.  I just really need to work on my over-reacting.  Im too damn sensitive
