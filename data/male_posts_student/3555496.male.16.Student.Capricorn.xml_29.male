Can you call me back? ", so out of common courtesy  i deleted it . she had been acting really bitchy towards me the last few days of skool, so i don't really care too much what she has to say.  so after all that drama i checked out the tube for a couple of hours. then the good news came: aldine independent skool district called my casa and told my 'rents that i  couldn't  be a part of carver's engineering program next year because i would be starting too late (11th grade). so that was the highlight of my day, being rejected from a skool for smartasses. on the downside, i have to stay in band, which means i have to see cggirl. but next year things won't be so bad because they're starting this new thing in band where everybody has 4th period as their band class. so that way we start marching at 1:00pm and get thru at 3:30pm instead of 5:00pm.  i think that's a bitchin' idea.     The Strokes - Hard To Explain   I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train I try but you see, it's hard to explain I say the right things, but act the wrong way I like it right here, but I cannot stay I watch the TV; forget what I'm told Well, I am too young, and they are too old The joke is on you, this place is a zoo You're right...it's true
