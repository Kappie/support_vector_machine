On the note of homework I talked to Michelle today, the person I was obsessed over in 7th grade (when I had no social skills to speak of), it's always nice to network with someone you haven't talked to in awhile.  That's why college is really gonna suck.  Am I gonna still just talk to my high school friends over IM?  Are we just gonna fall out of contact?  Some of us have been together since Kindergarden, and soon after 13 years of contact, we're gonna more-or-less just stop talking.  Just scatter to the far corners of the Earth.  That's a reason I'm hesistant about going to California for college, the thought recently entered my mind, and it seemed better when it snowed today, but still I don't want to move on to a completely new group of friends just yet.
