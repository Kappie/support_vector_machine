Plus I'm going to be giving away some invites at Gmailswap.com I can't believe that people are giving away things like Gameboys, iPods, CDs, and DVDs for a e-mail account. Go fig. Oh well, at least I got mine for free. Sad thing is, I begged on the G4techTV forums until someone felt sorry for me.  I really hope Gmail lasts a long, long,  long  time.
