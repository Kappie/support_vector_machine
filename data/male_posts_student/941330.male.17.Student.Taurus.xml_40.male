I spent 20 minutes sitting at my front steps cleaning my shoes...listening to birds chirping and feeling the breeze and seeing the blue sky...it was really peaceful. I liked it.    urlLink Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker !! AhHH!!  Hella people are sick right now, all the wind and stuff...and I'm coughing, meh...get better everybody.  I don't wanna swim. Too coold. And I hate history. Completely. And I don't wanna go to meets yet...too early! I'll suck.
