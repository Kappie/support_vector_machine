It is definitely my favourite movie of the summer thus far, and my favourite movie based on a comic book character/superhero yet!   From the opening scene to the end credits, Spider-Man 2 is full of non-stop action and suspense!  Now, if you're a big Spidey fan like me and read the comic books, then you'll notice a few things in this film that seem a little off, but those minor details can easily be overlooked when you're lost in the thrills of this movie.   If you only go to see one movie this summer, hell  so far  this year, make sure it's Spider-Man 2!     Rating:  5/5       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
