He really played hard today.  But not after he slept in late.  He got up around 8:20 and it was really foggy out.  He pictured that as a good sign for the weather though as often times when it is foggy early it is sunny later.  This would be one of those days.  Tyke got a nice jumpstart to his morning today by going out and getting gas.  It doesn't take Tyke any longer in the morning to get gas than it does to just drive straight to school.  Because he takes a different route when he gets gas is the reason for this.  Today there was quite a bit of traffic though.  But getting gas is a good way to wake up.  It gets Tyke out of his car and walks around and inhales the intoxicating aroma of gasoline and it is just fun.  Unless his hands smell like gas afterwards.  That part sucks but it doesn't happen often.  And Tyke showcased his great driving skills by maneuvering his car out of a tight squeeze when the Chevron guy in a hoooge truck showed up there.  The school day wasn't too bad either with 1st period being the worst and really it wasn't bad at all.  3rd period was fine except now apparently there is a quasi-boycott (ironic use of quasi) to occur tomorrow of that class.  Some students are outraged at the most recent tyrannical episode by the teacher when she imposed a referral on one of the class' own.  This enraged some of the leaders of the class and they are "saying" that there will be a boycott tomorrow.  Tyke is not going to participate however as he really doesn't want to have to face the consequences of it.  You can call Tyke a pussy too if you would like as he truly does not mind.  Tyke just does not want to have to face any reprimands from his parents.  And he is already on the bad side of his government teacher and actually would like to get back on her good side.  He is starting to succeed he thinks, so far.  The main point is that if you would like to boycott 3rd period then you seem to have some company.  4th period was a gay period today.  Stupid timed write from the 1991 AP test.  It was dumb.  Could have been easy but probably not.  This is the first AP test they have done in there all year, Tyke believes.  Last year at this point they had probably done about 10.  With like another 5 left.  Tyke has not been prepared for his AP tests at all this year.  Not at all.  It is just last year's knowledge seeping back through the limitless sports knowledge to come to the surface and be used again.  However, a majority of the time the knowledge that seeps back through has sports knowledge attached to it so he gets a little confused at what he was doing and then just thinks about sports.  But lunch was good.  JIB tasted good.  And the weather was fabulous.  Then class got fun.  He had 5th period, which isn't usually fun but BOOM!  Tyke gets the same sub as yesterday.  Immediately he reacts to Macaroon and is ecstatic by it.  After about 2 minutes Tyke makes his departure.  This is where the fun started.  Tyke talked to Big Twigg for about 15 seconds.  Then he saw Dotti and talked to her for a little while.  He just kept walking around the school though and talking to people as they actually came out of class and hung out with Tyke for a little.  Nobody out of Ritzer's class though.  Damn.  Tyke even went out to his car for a little then came back.  Yeah, Macaroon just called and ate up a couple of minutes.  No real point to that phone call but thats alright.  Oh yeah, 5th period.  Well Tyke came back and talked to Dotti some more and kept walking around when Amed came out.  So he went to the bathroom and then joined Tyke down at Tyke's car.  They listened to some good old Jack Johnson.  It was really nice.  Tyke even started his car and drove it around the parking lot and then backed it back into his spot.  Just so he can say that while skipping 5th period he drove somewhere.  As Amed left Tyke slowly walked around the parking lot trying to see if he could catch Purdy coming back from elementary tutor.  Guess what...he did.  She seemed surprised by his appearing there, justifiably so.  They chatted and started walking back to Tyke's class because the 38 minute class period was almost up.  Purdy suddenly realized that she forgot something in her car so she had to go back for it.  Tyke went back to his class, grabbed his backpack, looked around, then left again.  Still before the bell too.  Tyke was in class today for 4 minutes.  It was just great.  He met back up with Purdy and they went to Physics where they had a fun little demonstration to start off the period.  But before class started everyone was watching the two class turtles go at it.  Those turtles were really boning.  Damn.  Einstein (or Keppler, whichever one is the male) seemed pretty content up there.  Watching two turtles "copulate" is pretty hot.  Let Tyke tell you.  Now there is a natural aphrodesiac.  After school Tyke cruised home with his left arm out the window and changed and ate a little.  Then he headed up to Amed's bball court.  Maniak was already there and the three of them played a little 21 waiting for Skippy to arrive.  Tyke won 21 of course.  Then they played 2-2 and Tyke and Skippy won of course.  Then they played for a while longer until Skippy left and they played these Asians that were just shooting around and smoking some cigs on the other half of the court.  As they started this, Piggy J arrived after his little "turn your head and cough" minus the "cough" part.  Actually, that isn't even true.  None of that last part was true.  But that's ok.  Piggy J and the other 3 took on the 3 Asians.  Tyke flat out dominated.  He was pretty much unstoppable.  He scored like 9 of the first 10 points himself.  Amed had some nice assists as did Maniak and Piggy J.  The Asians got pwned.  After that ownage they switched up the teams and Tyke's team continued to dominate.  It is really fun to be the best player on the court.  Anytime.  Tyke tried to dunk but of course he was like 3" too short.  Basically got blocked by the rim.  Or maybe he didn't even get high enough to get blocked by the rim.  Dunking is hard.  Especially for an under 6' white guy like Tyke.  But Nate Robinson can do it and he's only 5'9" at the tallest.  He is just built.  Has to have like a 42" vertical.  At least.  If Tyke could jump 42" that would be insane.  He could pretty much put his hand on the top of the backboard.  How cool would that be?  Maybe he couldn't do that as he doesn't actually know what his vertical is.  He wants to find out.  Cuz he truly thinks he can jump pretty darn high.  Enough of that.  Tyke improved his baller on ESPN even more.  Now only Steals and Ball Handling can be improved.  His guy is real good.  So far this blog has taken 35 minutes to do.  Pretty soon it will be over.  1 more day.  3 more hours.  Thats cool.  Annnnnnnd scene.
