Our Gatlinburg excursion was fun!  cept i got dragged into that girly store Claire's!  i guess that what you get when you walk around Gatlinburg with 9 girls.  awww but it was fun!  we had the best time in Gatlinburg!  we rented out a rec center and we had free reign of it for a few hours!  Allison  Kirsten were shootin EVERYONE with their marshmallow guns!  oh it was great!  sunday we all got to spend most of the day hangin out.  then we went to play Laser tag and arcade games at like 12 at night.  yeah there was like no sleep on this retreat at all!  we were goin to bed at like 3:00 every night.  it was crazy!  yep!  twaz awesome!
