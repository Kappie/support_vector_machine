In other news I have taken up running about a mile in the morning and in the evening....I have also decided to drink the much hyped 8 cups of water daily....have I gone crazy?....mayhaps....  I really enjoyed talking with  urlLink Dani   yesterday....she is really cool peeps with some substance to her....not to mention that she is kinda fly....  Anyways I shall continue listening to Alanis and go about the rest of my day....
