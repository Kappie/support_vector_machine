When it occurs, that's the only GOOD day I've had recently. I've had average days, and a few bad days, but no good ones. That was fun. I'm not just going on about it cause it's Valentine's Day, I promise. Well, maybe I am. I think it's cause she's all in Venice, though, and I'm missing LFZ like nothing else cause they're all so cool... meeting Fi was great too, that would have been a good day if I hadn't forgotten to take my steroids.  ...How can the abscence of 3 people make me feel completely lost?  Love, Jon Roskilly
