Apparently, some folks in the conservative camp of the U.S.A. find this affection between two potential “world” leaders to be a tad disconcerting. Hugo Schwyzer offers a lengthy and intelligent  urlLink response  to these “concerns”. Hugo opines that the criticims regarding the affection shown between Kerry and Edwards is less a question of homophobia, since no one believes that either man is homosexual, and more an issue of interpreting open affection between men as a sign of vulnerability (read: weakness).  Although I basically agree with Hugo's analysis of the situation, I would add that the characteristic of "vulnerability" tends to be associated with "femininity" and hence with females (girls and women). Added to this is the historical tendency to view femininity in men as indicative of homosexuality. Thus, even though there might not be an overt implication of questioning either Kerry’s or Edward’s sexuality, by virtue of the fact that they behave in a way that has traditionally been suggestive of homoeroticism implies that the two men are at least showing poor judgement. In fact, the  urlLink blog  that first caught Hugo's attention to the topic uses the word “groping” (as in:  “Drudge has photo montage of the two Johns groping and cuddling each other at a photo opportunity.” ) to describe the affection between the two candidates. The word “groping” is typically used in a sexual sense as is often heard by women when they complain of men trying to “grope” them.   On the other hand, I agree with Hugo about how our culture responds to this kind of affection between two men, regardless of the sexuality of either of them. This is as much a cultural issue of the "norms" of how two people of the same sex should behave with each other as it  regarding "vulnerability" in men or homophobia. For example, in my Italian-American family I don’t think a time goes by that my father, brother, or I don’t hug and kiss each other every time we get together. The love and affection that these two men have shown me is one of the most important and precious things in my life.
