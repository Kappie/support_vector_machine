What has changed? Why do I feel so strange? Why is love so unkind?  As I watch you leave, it makes my heart feel sad. But as soon as you return, once more my heart is glad. But while your gone, you're what my minds still on, So I reminisce of the times we had.  When I go to run some ball, you're still in my head. When some girl's watching me, I imagine it's you instead. So I try to score, to win your heart once more. Does more truly need to be said?  When I lay in my bed, I almost wish I never knew Of what you feel or felt, of ur feelings true. Yet I hope it doesnt die, so I close my eyes Hoping to dream of you.  [25]
