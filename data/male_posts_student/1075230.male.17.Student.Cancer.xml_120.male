Argh. Well, I'll try to rewrite what I wrote earlier (the keyboard fell and the whole entry dissintegrated into white pixels) and I hope I wont forget anything. Grr... First off, if you don't want to hear about the War on Iraq, skip the next paragraph. In this entry I'll also try to talk about my school work, the ice storm, last Thursday, and I'll let you guys in on what I plan to do with this blogger! But most chances are I wont be done until mid-summer. Then of course, by then I'll be editing NandaPanda for its second release.   WAR What is it good for? - Absolutely nothing! Well you'll have to tell that to the people of Baghdad. Today the people of Baghdad finally got a chance to breath! The bombs stopped flying but were instead replaced with pictures and statues of Sadam Heussain as Iraqi citizens tore them from their stands and frames as their chance to say " Good bye! We wont miss you! " to their apparently former dictator. Heussain himself is rumoured to be dead, but proof of this claim has yet to surface. Although, the lack of Imperial Guards defending Iraq's capital might be of some pursuasion in this topic. That's right, the Americans didn't have to fight the army to claim Iraq. Although there were some "amateur" attackers, there has been, in the words of an American Soldier, "No organisation, no organized army."   SCHOOOOL's out, for SummeR! - Actually, not yet. BUT sOOn!!! And I'm not ready!!! >.   It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas... - That's if, they celebrate Christmas in a frozen over Hell! An ice storm hit Lower Ontario and parts of the US of A. Freezing Rain, Snow, Hail, all through Thursday and Friday night. I didn't go to Saturday Class because the Ice froze my van to the drive way. Though, that didn't stop me from going to Anime Society... actually, it kinda started  while  I was at anime society... Speaking of Anime Society...   Ani-Me-Ay! It's a Hell of A Town! (sung to the tune of New York New York - kind of a stretch... but it's late at night and I'm out of ideas. -.-) - Rei-chan came to anime society! Argh... but we had to walk to my house in  h.a.i.l  though... ARGH.  Rei-chan came to visit and we all went to Anime! Shu-kun took some time out of his dueling to hang with us, but afterwards when it was time to go, we noticed the hail. o.oU About this time, Hanna, Janice, and Trisha came back from their trip to the movies so Emerson stayed behind with them so he could take the same bus while Renae and I left to take the McNicoll bus.   We waited for almost half an hour. In hail .  The Kennedy bus came, so I told Renae it'd probably be better to catch that bus. When we got on it, Emerson, Hanna, Janice and Trish were on it! Mostly everyone got off at Finch, but only Renae and I went East. From Finch we walked to my house.  In hail . -.- Argh.  Argh, I have to go. Just one more thing and then I'll leave. For this site, I plan to change it, to coincide with a song. What do you guys think? I'm thinking  Ask DNA  but other songs can do too, like the RahXephon song, or even Sakura Saku... though that'd be hard without pink. *sigh*  -ArV
