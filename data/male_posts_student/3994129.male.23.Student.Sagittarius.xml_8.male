It was the first of back-to-back nights he played; I would very much have liked to have made it to the Friday night show, which was apparently very good (Avalanche! I wish that was on the setlist for Thursday!); Alas, work came in the way of being able to do the "double header".  Nevertheless, the concert was great. Aside from a few idiots throwing shit at the stage the crowd was actually very mellow and well behaved. The band was very tight and on point, my only complaint being that Christian's lead guitar was too low in the mix. As that this was the first time I have seen him live since the MGB/Audio of Being era (regrettably I missed the last tour), this is the first time I have been able to watch the "new/post MGB" lineup. I certainly wasn't disappointed. The set was mostly comprised of songs off of White Light Rock  Roll Revue, but the band also threw in some older material. I was hoping for "Suburbia" or "Prime Time Deliverance", but hey, you can't win 'em all.  A side note: one issue that irks me is the flak that Matt Good, or any other artist (irrespective of medium) who chooses to be outspoken in their political views, takes from both ignorant fans and the media. The "just shut up and play" mentality that the public applies to (ironically) public figures is beyond ridiculous. We like our entertainment, but not our art, it would seem. Mindless, vapid entertainment is fine and dandy, but God forbid any substance pertinent to the world at large comes into play.  Not only does the passivity that saturates many of our lifestyles affect us, but it colours the way we view others who *my God* actually try to be proactive and engaged in things. Amazing.  Anyways, Matt is very involved with  urlLink Amnesty International , and should be commended for using his status to help raise awareness about important Human Rights and political issues. I find it funny that his reputation as a sardonic, cynical bastard may precede him, but if one actually listens without preconceived notions, he is quite positive of late. His  urlLink blog  is highly recommended reading.
