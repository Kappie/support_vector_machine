Maybe if it snowed heavily and we got out of school. But no. It's just cold, no snow, but tons of dirty ice. I have to say the past couple of days have been warmer. Funny how I think that 40Â° is hot. That's what I get for living in Hazleton. As of now, Chevelle is the next coolest band to H.I.M. I don't know why I haven't been listening to them as much as I am now. They are great. Go buy their albums and their dvd. Great stuff. I say that God gets rid of winter. Forever. Winter is dumb. Summer = cool. At least let all the snow melt so I can go outside and do something other than slip and play football on ice. But I'll keep doing that for another (hopefully) month.  Listen to H.I.M. and Chevelle
