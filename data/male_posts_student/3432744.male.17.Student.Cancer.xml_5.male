Maybe I should be writing that instead of doing this...nah...  I've been trying to  figure out what I want to do with this blog, so I've kinda decided to have it serve as a couple of main functions... -To keep track of what I do every day, similar to a diary or journal. -To display any poetry I write -To express my emotions or to let off any pressure by just shouting it into the vastness of cyberspace :D. This is what I want my page to be about.  A personal web page thats easier to manage and enjoy than anything Geocities, Angelfire, Tripod, etc... can offer.  In the next week or so, I'll fill anyone who cares in on more about my life and more personal reasons as to why this is here as well.  But for now, I should get back to my essay!  'Later Andy
