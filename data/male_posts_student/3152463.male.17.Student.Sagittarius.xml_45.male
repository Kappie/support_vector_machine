I spent the day, as usual, boring myself half to death with inconsequential thoughts and ideas.  I had lunch at 1:30 PM (extremely late, but not my fault) - undoubtedly featuring sandwiches - which delighted my taste-buds no end ... Well, maybe  not , but  still  ...  The afternoon was spent puzzling over more inconsequential thoughts and ideas which would seem boring to an amoeba, with pen at hand.  It's amazing how uninteresting things can appear when you put your mind to it, you know.  I have discovered this through years of practice, preparation, and very long sessions of boredum, without any means of escape, or 'way out'.  I then returned to my 'place-of-dwelling' and sat down.  If any of the amphibiology above seemed somewhat thought-provoking, I advocate that you seek medical attention instantaneously, if not sooner.
