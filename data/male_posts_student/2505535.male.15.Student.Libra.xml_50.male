Today has been fun, well, yesterday, cos it's techniqually saturday, but I had my last exam and went to Croydon after with Dave and Rachel, we met Helen and Louise as normal, but not for as long, and they were speaking German *looks scared*  I bought a book (soul music by Terry Prachett)in Croydon and a DVD for my dad for father's day, it's Bill Hicks, I hope he likes it, we said we wouldn't get him that, and he said suprise me, so we decided to get it for him, heh, I think he'll like it, cos he likes most comedy stand up type people.  Then a load of people came back to my house (charl, Alice, Heather, Rachel - ok not that many people, but my house was crowded cos of mess and my whole family) and we watched a poor film "The students of Nuke'em High" or something along those lines, it was fantastic and crap at the same time, kick ass.  When I came online today I realised I had quite a few (actually only 4, one from him, and 3 others, all had apologies on the end - so maybe not 30 like he describes) e-mails with the same message from Brooke bitching at me cos I didn't say bye to him on msn, well, that was actually cos my internet buggered, so please if you would like send an e-mail to this address:  davidbrooke1165@hotmail.com  and calling him "Fryer Tuck" or "women features" =D I would be most pleased. Heh =P Oh and also go to  urlLink www.alexio.co.uk  and look on the forums for ways of getting a free mask.
