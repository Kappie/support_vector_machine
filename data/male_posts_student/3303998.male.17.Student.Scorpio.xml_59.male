As those who find themselves fitting this description realize, being gay is much more complicated than this. Being gay in a world filled mostly of heterosexuals is far from easy. Realizing one is gay, in it's most simplified description, is the first step toward living a fulfilled life of happiness and acceptance. It is the goal of GayPride.com to help you on your way to discovering the joys of admitting you are gay and coming out to others. We would like to give you a stepping-stone from which to begin your journey. Hopefully this will help to answer most of your questions on coming out and accepting yourself as you are. Once you have read the following pages, we encourage you to continue to find resourses and help so that you may grow and understand, and not be overwhelmed during your coming out process. It is also good to meet others who share your situation. You can ask tmen questions and find help to take the next steps in your life.  Admitting You Are Gay  Many people, especially teens, find themselves carrying out regular and normal lives dating and actively pursuing relationships with members of the opposite sex. For whatever their reasons, sooner or later they realize that their feelings and thoughts of same-sex attractions cannot be ignored. You may soon find yourself acting on your instincts and ambitions in an engagement with a member of your own sex. At that point, you may find things begin to feel right, more so than it does with others. Admitting you are gay can be a difficult thing to do. For some of us, particularly those with conservative and religious backgrounds, admitting we are gay may seem like a crime or even a sin. It is not uncommon to have feelings of shame when realizing you are gay. This is an unfortunate result of a society that has unrightfully developed a negative attitude toward gays. But as most gays come to realize, their feelings come quite naturally to them and there is no reason to feel shame because of them. As most gays and lesbians will agree, their sexual attraction to members of their own sex was formed early on in life. Most will also agree that no one, indeed no influence whatsoever, had anything to do with their turning out gay. It is simply a fact of life that some members of our society are blessed with a unique quality of same-sex attraction. For whatever the reason for this happening, it becomes evident that there is nothing you can do to change this quality. No matter how hard we try to deny ourselves the truth of our same-sex attractions, we will never be happy dating or being intimate with members of the opposite sex. Once this is realized, we begin to accept and explore our gayness. Most gays go through a period of time where they begin to question areas and parts of their lives that most people take for granted. They begin to question their sexuality and their way of thinking. We almost certainly recognize what the attractions to our own sex mean, but because of our extremely heterosexual based society, it is difficult to admit that we are different. Admitting to yourself that you are different-that you are indeed gay-is the first step in the coming out process. Once you can comfortably admit to yourself that you are gay, you are ready to move on and discover what being gay actually means for you. This may take some time, however. Some can grow comfortable with being gay almost immediately; others may take years. You will surely have your own pace, so don't rush things, and take them one day at a time.  What Does Being Gay Mean For Me?  Quit simply, one should ask, "What does being straight mean for heterosexuals?" The short answer is "Nothing." Being gay is no more different for gays than being straight is for heterosexuals. To think that gays live their lives differently is purely myth. As for every individual, finding out who you are is a life-long journey. Individuality is quite likely our greatest gift, and every human being has unique talents and gifts that set them apart from others. Our own interests and ambitions will guide us in how we use these gifts. This ambition is no different for one person than it is for another. We are all unique individuals who grow up and form our own unique lives. As with any individual, gay or straight, sexuality is paramount to defining who we are. It has a strong affect on who we are and how we act. The fact that we are gay or straight makes no difference as to how we lead our lives or carry out our affairs. As humans, we are all capable of the same things, and have the same abilities and limitations. Experiences and situations will forever mold and build one's personality. Whether gay or straight, it is important to make the most of our lives and to live each moment to its fullest potential.  Accepting Your Gayness  Acceptance will almost certainly take some time. After all, you have grown up in a world full of heterosexuals whose teachings have almost certainly caused some conflicts within your own psyche. Accepting your own sexuality is necessary to your personal growth as a human being. Sexuality is a key aspect of human personality and growth as individuals. Through time and experience, your sexuality will grow and develop just as your personality has done throughout your life. Accepting your gayness will come with time. Individuals, both straight and homosexual, must learn and accept themselves as who they are. Self-confidence is an issue that everyone deals with as they get older. Through time and experience, you will grow comfortable with yourself and your abilities. It is not uncommon for people to have issues with their self-confidence, and is something that a large majority of people, especially teenagers, face daily. This often leads to low self-esteem and the inability to be productive members of society. Once you realize that there is nothing wrong with being gay, and that it is simply who you are, you can begin to grow and develop personally. Your self-confidence will grow, along with your sense of self-worth.   Admitting to Others You're Gay  Now that you're comfortable with yourself, you should consider coming out to others. Not only should you be true to yourself and others about who you are, many gay men and women find that coming out is quite a liberating experience. But how should you go about coming out to your friends? This is a simple question with a very uncertain answer. Before coming out to others, you should consider who you are coming out to. While you should now be comfortable with yourself and your gayness, this doesn't mean everyone else will be. Most gays prefer to come out to a close friend before coming out to anyone else, such as a family member. Many find their friends more understanding than others. Many gay men and women find that once they are "out of the closet", not only are they free to be themselves, but they soon lose the fear and apprehension about coming out to new people. At any point, however, coming out to someone is an uncertain task. You know your family and friends better than anyone-How they react to things such as events in the news and other people. You may be surprised as to how your friends and family react when you tell them the news. If you are living with another person, such as a friend or family member, you should consider this when approaching them. If you are sure this person will react acceptingly to your coming out, then there should be no problem with your doing so. However, if you are living with someone who is openly anti-gay or discriminatory toward gays, you should be extremely careful. In fact, it might even be a good idea to wait until you can support yourself should you find yourself on the street as a result of your coming out.  Meeting Other People  Once you have grown comfortable with yourself, you will want to meet others who share your qualities. Meeting other gays and lesbians will give you a sense that you are not alone. In fact, many gays find themselves as close to their friends as their real families. Making friends and being social is a basic concept of human existence, and this driving force is no different for gays. There are several ways of meeting and socializing with others. You will simply have to discover the method of meeting people that works best for you. A good place to start, however, is with the Internet. Many gay and lesbian sites, such as gaypride.com, offer meeting places and services where gays and lesbians can meet and interact with one another. This is a good place to start simply because the privacy that the Internet gives us can make us more secure and confident in ourselves. Once you feel you are ready, you can begin to meet others face to face. This is best achieved through support groups and meetings of gay and lesbian groups. There, you can find others who share your newfound qualities and interest in personal growth. It is important to find quality role models from which you can ask questions and advice when you find it necessary.  Learning the Truth About Being Gay  While the basic concept of being gay is no different than being heterosexual, you will find that being gay can often complicate life. It is unfortunate that society has pushed away acceptance of gays over the centuries, but it is indeed a great time we live in. While we must still advocate gay rights in today's society, we have come a long way in acceptance in just the past few decades. We must strive to overcome the stereotypes and pre-dispositions that the people of this world view as being gay. With more and more people coming out of the closet, this goal will become easier and easier. But until we see widespread acceptance of gays, we will continue to endure hate and other negative emotions from those who do not understand that being gay is perfectly normal. We must continue to educate and advocate gay and lesbian issues to society. We must fight to gain and protect our rights in today's society and to put an end to the hate and discrimination we endure every day. Thank you for reading our brief tutorial on coming out. We encourage you to read more information and meet with others who can help guide you as you grow. This is copied from www.gaypride.com
