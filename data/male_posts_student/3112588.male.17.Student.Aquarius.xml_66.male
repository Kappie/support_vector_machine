LoL! picked laura up for church this morning, since her parents took andy down to SDSU to do w/e...so, yeah--took her to church. i was bad, and cut sunday school with ruthie dyer. she was knitting, and she tried to let me figure out her puzzle rings. funny thing is, i thought that you were supposed to separate all the rings--but little did i know that the word "ring" gave it away LoL! it turned into a ring...but hey, im from CV (which some ppl hate that excuse haha), but its true...only me, right? no...prob laura and sara too! LoL! after sunday school was over...went to sit in the "sin box"/"devil's den" (aka--balcony) with my CV homies! we didnt really listen to Mr.Lanet's message--but he's a cool guy. he's always been nice to the 3 of us for some reason. but yeah! after church, we were gonna go to my house and do w/e, but "momma j" (mrs j) told us to come over, b/c she ordered pizza. so, we went to sara's house, and watched the first disc to the season of Friends. LoL! "I once was a wooden puppet!!!" LoL chandler--def a fave among everyone, im sure...so after that was over, just listened to some music in sara's room, and.....talked about "dirty" stuff! LoL shared things we've done---we're all quite bad i guess....well, they decided that I'M bad! haha. laura and i were like being pigs--and we each had like 5 slices of pizza, and like 2 soda's...good stuff. they left for church with mr j, and i waited for my parents, b/c my mom wanted to know what was the dillio for tonight--we told her that we were gonna get together at laura's house, since they like love me (laura, gotta get that shirt for your dad with the guy holding the gun: Mothers Love Me! haha)....so yeah. came to my house after church, and after talking to like everyone. i did some chores really fast, and then hopped in the car where I DROVE with laura in the front seat to hollywood video to get some movies--and then she drove home. laura, good job today--much better than the "illegal" TP night...but we all learn in time, right? ("this isnt it...its betty's sister, donna! LoL). we got "Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights" and "Along Came Polly". havana nights was good, but not believable--didnt really get into it, prob b/c we were all talking so much, eating BUTTERSCOTCH pudding, chips, drinking soda...and giving massages to eachother! LoL! katy was soo funny though: "yeah, bump that van with the 46 inch rims...or w/e they're called!" hahah funny stuff. beka said that we were being really quiet and good (she was studying), so she made us some Strawberry Lemonade...nice job beka--good stuff btw! we all talked while the movie was running. beka ran to the store to get some cereal and US Weekly, then came home. when the movie was over, we all ran to get more food and talk to Lew for a few (rhymed haha) on the comp. funny guy, i guess--and hot, so they say! LoL! after that, went to watch a little bit of "Along Came Polly", tried to paint laura's toenails...didnt work....then i finally got a massage from laura--her "famous" hand massages. good stuff laura--ill teach you the trick to it one day soon though, kk? so, all in all it was a great day--the CV groupies are finally back together after like 3 months of total SEPARATION...well, not total..but you get what i mean, right?
