Yep, I'll be visiting my hometown of  urlLink Rochester, NY  for a week, then a long weekend in  urlLink Albany, NY  (where I lived for over nine years), and then end the "tour" with a visit on the  urlLink Cape  with a dear friend of mine.   I doubt I'll have ongoing access to a computer so the posting here should be sparse for a time.  Ciao, ciao!
