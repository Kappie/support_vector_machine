He's an incoming 1L who not only uses footnotes in his weblog, but uses them well.  The post I'm linking to, I'm linking to because of this:   Is the movie White Chicks with Shawn and Marlon Wayans going to be the worst movie of the summer? Of the year? Of the decade? My mom saw the commercial and said it looked funny.  I'm not going to comment on that, because I wouldn't want to say anything but nice things about my wonderful mom.
