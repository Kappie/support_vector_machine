BY THE GOVERNMENT. JEBUS.      and theyre not even fucking sure if there is gold in the place. what if there's no gold in the goddam area? well the government, not the guy, will have spent millions of dollars to find out that theres no gold, they just fucked up the environment, and they have an external debt because of some weird treaty the country made. (like always)      what jobs is it gonna give? because they always say "oh, its gonna give jobs" but its bullshit. they usually do this: ok lets bring 40 locals and make them work 10 hours a day at minimum wage for a year. after that, they fire them all. jesus man, that was hell of a job oportunity, specially when the next people you hire are stupid gringo tourists who propel sexual tourism. go figure.      out of the gold that is extracted, how many of it is the country gonna keep? this are the things that my beoved president would probably do:      1- donate the gold to the US for no apparent reason   2- share the money among themselves   3- spend the money on building roads, which translates to having Ignacio Santos buying cars with the money, or making random amounts of cement poke out of the roads, ike you can see near plaza del sol.   4- give it to the guy who promoted the gold thing.   5- give it so that we can "boost tourism" which means sped it on nightclubs and more advertisements of night clubs along the road   6- give it to the church, so that priests can become richer   7- give it to me. ill make good use of it, trust me. xD   8- give it to the MEP, so that THEY CAN ACUTALLY PAY THE TEACHERS   9- im out of ideas.      well you get the idea.      second, why would i want to help them make this proyect? so that the president can become richer and NOONE noticing? fuck off, im not paying my taxes for that.      can you imagine the enviromental damage? ok lets see:      -the biggest erosion that costa rica has ever seen, apart from the teca wood.   -lots of dead fish because there's no water   -less frests, more dirt roads   -houses having entire mountains falling on them      well you know. read mamita yunai. whats going on right now is the same as to what happened 70-100 years ago, in the book. (i donno when it was. sue me.)      i say, fuck the proyect. thats not the goddamned way to go. and if youve got a problem about it, im fucking waiting.          NO REFORMATION WITHOUT  REVOLT
