Even though I was dead tired after playing, it felt so good to be outside again. And from what I hear, it's supposed to be nice this weekend too. Ah I love it. But something I  don't  love is research papers. Yep it's that time of year again when we must busy ourselves researching, reading, working, puking, and worrying about stupid research papers. Somehow my topic went from "The electric guitar's effect on rock music" to "Jazz and how Blues became a seperate music entity". Yep I don't know either. Either way it's going to be a pain to look stuff up. But GOD I LOVE WARM WEATHER. YEAH. Ok sorry. SO an update on my NCAA bracket: my bracket = destroyed. Pitt lost. Cuse lost. *sigh* Oh well. Now I'm rooting for UAB to win it all. That would be amazing. But oh well. Gatorade = too good = me drinking way too much of it = upset stomach. Hmm I want to play some more basketball. Too bad it's 10 o clock. Yep thank god winter is gone. Maybe this year I'll actually get a little better. .....(thinks about rediculous statement just made)..... hah naw.  Listen to H.I.M.
