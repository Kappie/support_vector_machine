False teachings they profess, and from the truth they digress. They are the walking dead.  The skeptics say they will believe when they see.  But, the truth they shall see, when they believe. They are the walking dead.  Lord please open their hearts. And let them see the truth and come to the father. So that they may no longer be the walking dead.  Elliott  [walking dead concept originated by my good friend David Stehlik] The walking dead are those who do not know Christ.
