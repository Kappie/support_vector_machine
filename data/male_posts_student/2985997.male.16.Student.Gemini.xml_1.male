I’ll admit it was quite engrossing, but I found the ending totally unbelievable – why would Ripley go back to rescue a girl she only recently met from an Alien nestwhere ten or so well-trained marines had been slaughtered while she’d previously been unwilling to try and help save the lives of the hundreds of people in the colony? Despite that minor gripe though, it was, for the most part, enjoyable and the “get away from her, you bitch!” line was particularly rousing – hurrah for feminism! Or is that a misunderstanding?  At any rate, the film got me thinking about alien music and, in place of some music which really does come from another planet, I thought I’d bring you some music which merely  sounds  like it comes from a different planet. Yes, I bring you Kraftwerk.  Kraftwerk - Showroom Dummies  Of course everyone has, at one point another, listened to Kraftwerk; in my eyes they are to electronic music what the Beatles are to Pop/Rock; but, before I started exploring most of their albums, I really only knew them as the band whowrote The Model. Anyway, I've been listening to their 1977 album  Trans-Europe Express  and was very impressed with the package as a whole wonderful melodies, of a calibre rarely found on electronic albums interwoven with chugging beats and distorted vocals. The above track stands out not only for the revolutionarybeats and bleeps but also for the wacky lyrics. How many other artists could write such a hypnotically beautiful song about a subject as apparently mundane as mannequins anyway?    urlLink [Buy Kraftwerk -  Trans-Europe Express  from Amazon.co.uk]
