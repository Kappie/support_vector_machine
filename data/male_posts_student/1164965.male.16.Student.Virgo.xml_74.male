There are a lot of good ideas generated in each mind/group/class period, and I'm really enjoying reading them so keep it up!  (Beck, your post was especially eloquent)  Today in class, (M) discussion seemed especially productive in my group, and I thought we came up with a really thought-provoking level 3 q.  Lennie and George rely on each other for various reasons; does their relationship signify a shift in American Literature AWAY from self-reliance?  I think it's quite interesting because since Emerson and Franklin to Huck Finn, there has always been that underlying theme.  The suggestion that Lennie and George can be viewed as one entity and are self-reliant in that way was one way of countering the question, but has anyone read anything to suggest that there is a paradigm shift in American Lit?  What events could be triggering this shift?  Post your thoughts, and anything else you'd like to say... I'd like this blog to become somewhat of a politcal/current events forum as well, because I like to argue.  Love Rob
