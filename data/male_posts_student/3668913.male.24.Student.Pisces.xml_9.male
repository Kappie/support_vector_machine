Rejection from someone whom we respect and admire. Rejection is really something that attaches itself to us, and its ugly head will come out in times when we are feeling down or discouraged. It is like a poison that seeks to poison the innermost of our soul, leading us to doubt the value that is placed inside of us by our Father God.   People are not born with a low self inferiority complex. But perhaps, as we grew older in life, the various trials and tests that we faced rubbed off on our confidence. Sometimes, we would face people that reject us, subconsciously or directly. They may not tell us that they reject us directly, but from their words and indifference towards us. Sometimes, it would be better if they say so directly. But regardless of its intensity, it is never an easy pill to swallow. Sometimes, people around us will try to encourage us by saying certain "nice" lines, such as "Well, it's not your fault...", "if you lose a bit of weight, you would attract more attention from the opposite sex...", or even "if you work harder in your school work...", but all these seem to sound hollow in the face of rejection. Perhaps, no one knows about the word more than King David.  Many times, we think of King David as a popular man, a good looking man and a strong leader who never has to face rejection. But as you begin to read the bible, you would know that nothing is further than the truth. He has to deal with rejection all throughout his life. His father did not believe that he is leadership material when Samuel came to his household to seek out the new king of Israel. His elder brothers accused him of being wicked and conceited when he want to encourage them in a battle with the Philistines. His mentor and leader rejected him and sought to kill him. Even when he grew older, his own son rejected him as king and father and sought to kill him too. Yet throughout it all, he has never let the spirit of rejection stop him from reaching out to his destiny. He never allowed the thoughts of rejection to dwell in him and stop him from fulfilling the purposes of God in him. Most of all, he never allowed them to bring forth doubts in God and His goodness. He simply chose to submit to God and to thank God in all things and all circumstances. Most of all, he chose to believe that God loves him and accepts him. This is something, that all of us can choose to do.
