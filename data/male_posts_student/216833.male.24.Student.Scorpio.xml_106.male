Those little wheels in my head were going everywhere and I don't even remember what was on my mind.  Eric, nick, alex, and vanessa came to my apartment last night around 12 to pick up eric's bass amps that were stored in my garage. That makes a little more room in there. I seriously need to take a fine comb and clean that garage up. It's a fucking mess from hell.   My Projects (unfinished):  - Restore Mortal Kombat arcade system. - Restore 1979 Vespa Rally 200 and purchase engine for Vespa p-200 - Clean garage - Finish numbering and stuffing 7" records (order poly sleeves) - Make 10k Drive buttons before July 14th (order button pieces) - Sale Time Killers arcade system - Buy mimi birthday present (july 17th) - Find a job in California - Quit smoking pot - Drink more water everyday - Lose the extra fat around my belly - ETC...............  Other than the long and drawn out project of planning the rest of my life - those are just some temporary ones. Maybe that was the mess on my mid last night - I dunno.  I just got the bump and that is good. I can't remember many months where it has happened this early. The bad part is, i get it this month on the 2nd - next month it might be the 9th and that is an extra week to wait. I'm looking forward to a change in the way my job goes. I need to get a handle on these fucking taxes - I'm so lost.
