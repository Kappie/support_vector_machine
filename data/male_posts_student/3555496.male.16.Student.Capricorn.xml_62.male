I decided I needed to transfer some new jams to my walkman, since the songs I had on there were pretty old. So after I... how should I say...  aquired    7 new cds (in .mp3 format of course), I set out on my quest to cut the  yard . It was 3pm by the time I got out there.  I got some kerazy phone calls lately. Some  weirdo  from the the other side of the world called a few days ago. This other dude wanted to know if Carlos (?) lived here. And lastly, some chica wanted to know if I wanted to subscribe to Vibe.
