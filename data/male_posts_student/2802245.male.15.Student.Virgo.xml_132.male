All credit goes to Beckett who adapted the layout, and design most of the site, while I suggested this and that, and did some of the table layouts.    Everybody is working:    Jamie - Working on the site, pages, andadsand his Flash movie evil.swf (not the final name, btw)  Beckett - Working on the site, pages, logos, layout... etc (a lot of work here)  Han - working on his articles, and his Flash animation, still unnamed right now, though its suppose to be a sprite animation  James - Not sure, but think he is working on his Flash animation, a parody of Kill Bill?   Good work done today, pretty happy with all the progress.      Jamie   ,  urlLink Black Ghost Staff
