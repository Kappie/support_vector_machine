Who cares? I'm sure he's fine.    He won't shut up about me  It's all he talks about  Like some kind of stalker  Always asking for time      My time  It's so boring with him  What a freak    I don't understand any of it  I makes me so sad somtimes  All they talk about is useless rubbish  All they worry about is pointless garble  I need someone to keep me sane some of the times  Like a kindred spirit or something  But she doesn't need me  None of them need me  And it makes me feel so pointless  Knowing that I have no purpose  Knowing that I have no talent  Knowing that I'll never find anyone  Hoping someone will find me  I dress in black because you'd all rather I were a shadow  You'd rather I wasnt real  The tarnished spot of dirt on you're otherwise clean cloth    This is so pointless
