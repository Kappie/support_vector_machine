Not so bad though, because they weren't all that important to team morale going up. Kinda harsh and all, but still truthful.  This past Tuesday was crazy for me. No work because I had an optometrist appointment. I thought about the poof of air in my eye, and the dialted pupils, but oddly enough, none of that happened. It was some eyedrops in my eye that numbed them up for a li'l bit of pressure to test for glaucoma. That was it though. I got my prescription and for the first time, I think I might see 20/20 in each eye. But, instead of enjoying 'normal' sight, I have to wait until next week to pick up my trial pair of contacts. Oh, and I did manage to meet someone I forgot about totally. They remembered me, but I still can't put a name to their face. I just know I met them, and can kinda associate where I met them. It has just been so long since I met them though, that makes it hard to recall their name, or if even I'm supposed to know it?  So today (thursday)turns out to be the first time for physical training (p.t.) in what seems like forever. Not bad at all, but when me and my ride (Dez) get there, we manage to both forget something. Well, his is actually important, but my thing is pretty trivial, yet good enough to ride w/ him to get his thing. We take the trip back, get our things, but kinda dog it on the way back. We even manage to stop by a local store to get some eats before heading back. Once we do get there, the complex looks like a ghost place almost. We start our ascent up the hill and while heading up, we let out some whistles and warhoops just to find out that everyone is out of earshot. So, we do the quick uphill downhill thing and start to wonder if we were in fact the only ones doing that? It just so happens we weren't, just a little late.  But, the day before though, it was heated. Like in the 100's heated. Not only that, but I"m dehydrated from being sick too. So we're working out in the heat and I"m dehydrated trying to do my normal thing (bust ass). Turns out, I can't do that in my condition, and I had to find out the hard way, cramps. So my upper body is cramping up bad in various places in varied intervals. If it wasn't the shoulders and side aches, it was the chest and back. Then there was also the neck acting up too. So I thought that was that, but then the legs wanted in on the action. So I downing water left and right, but somehow, that just didn't cut it.  After work, I get home, worried about cramping up more. I eat bannanna after bannanna and drink some powerade too. Altogether, I manage to eat about 5 bannannas to myself, and drink over a gallon of water over the day and night. All that, and still I try to cramp up. So before I try and sleep I get one last bannanna by the bed along w/ somemore water. Luckily, it wasn't needed.  I wake up and hope today isn't as bad as yesterday. Again, it's hot. We do the P.T. thing and head off to our worksite. More of the same thing that made me cramp up, but instead of cramping, I manage not to. To keep the muscle tension at bay, I drink water and gatorade. About the same as before though, so yesterday's effort did pay off, just not in the timely manner I expected.
