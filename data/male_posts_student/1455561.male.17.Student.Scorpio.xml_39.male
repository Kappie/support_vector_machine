Its snowing in what might be the most depressing way ever: about 5 flakes have drifted down onto my windowsill and now it seems to have stopped.  yep, it's stopped.   So anyway it turns out that not only are we all made of mostly nothing but the stuff that isnt nothing is both a wave and a particle whilst being neither.  However it is always energy and when the particles move they tend to behave as waves whilst still being particles, but the faster they go they get more mass because of relativity, however they might be waves and therefore have zero mass to begin with.   And schroedringer didnt like cats much because his has been alive and dead for about 30 years.  In other news, the square root of minus one doesnt exist.  However the square of the square root of minus one (something that doesnt exist) is 1.  So now nothing squared is 1 and buildings are both 100 and -100 metres tall whilst being entirely composed of complete nothingness and some little things that cant quite make up their minds if they are there or not and what exactly they should be.  But lets not forget that if you were to actually measure any of this happening you would change the results and therefore prove that black was white and explode in a logic implosion.  To me this just proves that we know as much about the universe as a particularly stupid duck billed platypus knows about the menu at KFC.
