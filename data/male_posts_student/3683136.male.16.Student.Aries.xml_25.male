With Ja going to college and Gareth being a junior and all, both of them are going to be having very fully years.  I hope things work out for them.  Gareth started reading this thing, and now knows a lot more about my life than he did at this time yesterday.  Which is good.  I'd wanted to tell him so much of this stuff, but I just couldn't.  Sarah caved.  I'm happy because of it.  I'm really glad that she chose to start bitching to me again.  I think it was a bad idea to not tell anyone anything.  It could only lead to badness.  Also, Sarah revealed some shit in her journal last night that's pretty shocktastic.  I'm oh so happy for her though, because she finally declared her public joining of the vast conspiracy.  Well, after finally going to sleep around 4, I sat in bed for several hours.  Around 5, the damn birds started chirping, and around 5:30 it was fully light outside.  That fucking sucked.  So I wound up with maybe 4 hours of sleep tonight.  I guess I'll just drink lots of Caffiene.  But I'm going to try to go back to sleep.  Wish me luck. -Mike  Shalala, shalala, shalala, the end is growing near
