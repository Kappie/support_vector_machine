Despite all the "peace" (if you can call it that) that we have gained from violent acts it makes us as a civilization no less violent. In fact all it does is solidifies our ability to commit acts of violence. Traditionally violence has also almost always lead to new "innovations" in how we can kill each other better faster and more effectively.   Calling George Bush Jr. a terrorist isn't technically accurate. Point is you can't call a political leader like George Bush a terrorist. It doesn't matter what his actions are because he doesn't fit the profile of a terrorist. He isn't using acts of violence to destabilize America or its political processes. Now a better description of Bush would be a that of one who has committed war crimes. As far as I am concerned invading a country is an illegal act no matter what the circumstances. Then with the prison abuse scandal, which I strongly believe went far higher up the chain of command than just a couple of officers who were bored out of their skulls.   Oh yeah and I hate the Americans damn freedom crap... All it ever leads to is problems. Just look where they are now, trying to defend American values and in the oddest place Iraq, now I'm no scientist but I am pretty sure that Iraq is NOT America. Americans should be defending their values in their own country, not forcing them upon others. Doesn't matter if the leader of that country is a mind crunching evil dogooder. There is a reason you don't bring emotions into decisions like Iraq, but emotions did get caught up in Iraq and look what happens. Oh and by the way that emotion was fear.
