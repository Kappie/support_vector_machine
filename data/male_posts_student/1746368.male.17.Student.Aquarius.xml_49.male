Which reminds me, that is the "Site o' the day". Actually, I don't know how good the site is, since I only visited it to get the link. I am sure it will have information on the book series, if you are interested. Well, right now there really isn't much more to say. I woke up and played some Nintendo briefly. Mostly because I was bored. Derek isn't awake yet, so I can't go on my computer and I'm stuck on my parents with a crappy keyboard. Actually, it used to be my keyboard, but when I got the wireless I put it in storage and their old keyboard was murdered. Anyways, I have a whole lot of nothing to accomplish until 3:00. Dominique gets off work then.
