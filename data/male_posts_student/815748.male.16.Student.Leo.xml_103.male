When I first got here, my host mother made a big deal about buying kosher food for me after I said I couldn't eat the pork pizza she had made.  She actually said (and I'm paraphrasing but it was pretty much exactly like this), "I love Jewish people.  Some of my best friends are Jews."  Today, when I didn't feel like going to a German movie with French subtitles, she thought I didn't want to go because the Nazis had done something to my family.  Jesus Christ.  That's one of my biggest like anti-stuff positions.  In my humble opinion, distinctions shouldn't make ANY difference except those that are inherent to them, like how I can't eat pork because I happen to be Jewish.  That means that we shouldn't discriminate because of differences, but we also shouldn't celebrate differences, like Jennifer Huntington and all her PC goons force us to.  We shouldn't celebrate differences since then, even if everyone thinks that Judaism is The Most Wonderful Thing in the World, they still see me as a Jew.  I am not a Jew.  I'm a person.  I'm a human being.  Jesus.  I feel like writing an essay.  But I blew my chance to express this, one of my biggest theses, in an essay, so now I'm stuck writing about how in the nineteenth century, China and Japan reacted to Western influence in many different, related ways...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...huh?  What?  Oh.  Well, at least yesterday I got to write about how Sophocles was the suckiest sucker whoever sucked.  My last two sentences were: However, with reasoned analysis, it is clear that Oedipus Rex cannot meet modern standards of tragedy.  Either that, or Sophocles simply was not a very good playwright to begin with.  Ah, I love bashing what teachers think is cool.  As I told Stephanie Kaplan in a postcard, cynicism is my only escape from the drudgery of school.  Ahhhhhhh, vented.  That was so refreshing.  Like an Herbal Essences commercial, although Garnier Fructics commercials are so much cooler.  OK, now I'm rambling.
