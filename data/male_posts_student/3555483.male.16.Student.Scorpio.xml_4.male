Err went to Dentist today.. a lil cavity.. ouch.. but after that went to Vicky and Jackson's store. Everyone is opening restaurants now haha yea so hung out tehre for a while.. talked to Jackson and Vicky then went with DAd adn Tim to Fry's and bought one of the mini fridges. Then went to Grace's Dad's restruant. Dad had to fix something there, so then Grace's mom took tim adn i to their house. Watched a beautiful mind with Allen. Hmm.. weird movie but i kinda udnerstood it better this time. Last time on the plane, didn't really get it. SO yeah.. THen got hom and saw my jersey!! yay! but also got a lot of bites suddenly.. dunno if fleas or mosquiteos.. argh..  sunday went to first youth EE class. Wow.. it really is a commitment thing.. but i think i'm gonna do it. Needa write a testimony and find prayer partner.. i think i'm gonna ask Andy to be one.. he'd be a good one.. but other one.. can't decide between two people. Esther or Steph.. so.. ionno.. weird.. naturally i think i should pick Esther adn ask her.. but somehow i think STeph and I woudl benefit more from it, i guess.. But i doubt she'd be able to do it. SHe's' always busy. So I mite just end up asking Esther. She's always cool. hehe god i love her. Oh and SUnday first time leading worhsip.. OMG... yea i kinda froze in ALL my LIFe, worst thing u can do.. stop..a rgh.. but eveyrhting else went alrite.. i guess it coulda been worse.. haha oh well.. Summer school about to start.. argh.. adn mom keep pressuring me to do SAT's i guess i should better start up on it.. yea.. alrite.. well..got a lot of thinking to do.. about EE. Testimiony i think i mite just write about how growing up as Christian, i've always had this comfort feeling from God. I know i'm never alone and i can always rely on God to pull me through. :) thanks God. You're AWESOME!!!
