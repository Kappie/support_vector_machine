Very bored at home...nobody wants to go out with me T.T...Arrrrr...nevermind. I miss my friends. But I'm more of like feeling  lonely and friendless now. Well, at least got to talked to Adrian a bit more recently. I've sorted out my thoughts. I just hope for the best in keeping things positive. Well, the sky is clear now(Adrian say it should be "skies"...but I think "sky" looks nicer.) So once again, I can absorb the sunshine!!! haha!!! I don't know what to say now. I just feel plain lonely. And I miss lots of people. And it's like besides my family, I only keep in contact with my jie(still somewhat my family...haha!) But look on the bright side!!! I'll be going to catch a movie with my siblings and Paul will be bringing his brother along. (my sister says that we're alike, but I doubt so, cause I'm so...weird...or if it's better, extraordinary!!!haha!!!) But somewhat looking forward to it... Yesterday, my Mom got baptised. Got some photos of that moment. And I'm really happy that she got baptised. As for me, I'm still thinking. I think I will soon. Maybe this November. I've been thinking, and that should be no reason for me to wait if my faith is there. So...yupz!!! Then, today I went to the airport to send my father off. He'll be in Australia for two weeks. Exploring around. Then basically, we were there too early. So we just ate and talked and ate...so fun! Like family outing, I really enjoyed the time with my family. OK...really nothing much.Guess life continues on. I just wanna have better time with God.
