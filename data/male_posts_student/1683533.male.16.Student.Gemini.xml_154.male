Some people are pissed that it is in 3D, but I like it, also the Bazooka is easier to aim in 3D.  There are also a couple new weapons, a more in-depth landscape generator, lots of missions and more.  However, they got rid of the Suicide Bomber and Kamikaze weapons...probably because of the shit happening in the middle east...don't want to get certain people angry.  Oh well, I barely used those weapons anyways.  I am currently going through the long process of putting all my links back up, I really should have copied my template, but now I have to go and find all the band links and other links again >_  Also, the 9miles2go site is finally up, some parts are still under construction, but the tourdates and guestbook and some other stuff are running, so  urlLink check it out .  They are currently on a large scale US tour, I think they are just going out west to california and back doing shows along the way.  Sounds fun, I am gonna go to one of their concerts when they come home.  Well, that's all for now.  peace
