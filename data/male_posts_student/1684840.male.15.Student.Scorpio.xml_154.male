I've never actually watched one successfully in the past - at all.  I've always missed them :(  I just hope that it's not cloudy.  I might be able to take pictures if its visible enough (hopefully!)  So then, back to school tomorrow and all the tests have finished so it's back to coursework, stupidwork and homework!  All we do in English lessons is coursework, coursework and nothing else!  It's like, we finish one piece and move straight onto the next.  It's mad!  Should be putting those sleepover pics up in the gallery later if I can be arsed.  Cya...
