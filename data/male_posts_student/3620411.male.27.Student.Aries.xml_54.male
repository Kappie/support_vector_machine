I used to just logon the net, start outlook express and msn messenger, and browsing some web.   the maximum time i could spend is 3 hrs at the time. Many time less as my university account allow only 30hrs a month.   Yesterday, i found myself online and sufing from about 9 am to about 11pm :( took some time off for breakfast, lunch, and dinner ..   found myself download MP3 over 630 MB... Geesss!!!!  need to change my habbit soon ...   ok,leave u guys now ..take care ...
