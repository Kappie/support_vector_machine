Technically, there's actually no reason for me to do so as I only need 9 out of 12 module passes every year, and have got 9 already with other term's exams, but ther is such a thing as pride you know. Incidentally- what's wrong with being prideful anyway. Sureyl if you take pride in yourself and your work then there is no reason for anyone to come dsown on you saying that it's a bad thing. Ho hum.  Also this week, my revision was slightly distracted by having to have my wisdom teeth pulled. In fact they've needed doing for about 6 years, but I never actually got around to it until I went back to university and so I get all my health stuff free so why not? There's a bit of a catch here though. When I first applied for assistance, I wasn;t working, and so I got all the help I could need, so I made this appointment. However, by the time I have come to have the operation actually done, they have re-assessed me at the working rate and i am now liable for a bit (still it's better than nothing) and it's too late to back out now. I'll spare the gory details, suffice to say that I only got onbce side done (the other is due next Monday) and the upper took about 10 minutes to encourage out, but the lower took a full three quarters of an hour, with both dentist and assistant heaving away and using pulling things and extra incisions. Ow. Still I spoke like the POntious Pilate guy in  urlLink Monty Python  which was very amusing to all I'm sure.  Still, you'll be glad to know I've recovered in time for them to rip the other side.
