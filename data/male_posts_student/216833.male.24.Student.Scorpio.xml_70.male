I hit the snooze button three times every morning after 7:30 - I lay there until mimi says get up about two times - and then she leaves for work. No I get up - it's usually 8:30 by now. ? I don't mind a little routine now and again. A daily routine of preparing yourself for what the day holds is never a thing I would lightly throw out the window. I'm not saying I spend an hour fixing my hair. I don't think I will ever have to do that. [Unless I go for the 'comb-over'. Next of kin to the mullet.] I just feel generally better through-out the day if I took the time to iron my shirt or make sure my armpits don't stink.  ? Maybe it's all self-esteem - probably. ? I feel sorry for this dog next door. Up to a point I feel bad for the dog. Then I start getting pissed at the owners. Every morning around nine, this dog gives out the loneliest howls and bellows. I've seen this dog a few times too. She is a great Dane the size of a house. I wish I had the strength of some of these big breed dogs. Big black and white spots look like she came from the house of an 18th century novel writer who spilled a lot of ink.  ? I guess the owners leave around 8:30 or so, right about the time I am talking myself into staying in bed. This couple is extremely over-weight. I just don't get that lazy twinkie eating shit. I never see a health problem as the cause of their being overweight. To me, you can always work it off. To many times it seems that being over-weight is the cause of the health problem. I just that poor dog didn't feel so attached the her owners. She is just going to get eaten anyways.
