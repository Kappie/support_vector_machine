I always wanted a nice house, expensive television, moderately nice, fuel efficient car; all the fruits of a sucessful life. But I also need someone to enjoy it with. Someone that I can cook fancy dinners that I saw on Food Network for every night. Someone to stay up late watching indie movies with on weekends, rather than going out and getting wasted. Someone that can yell at me for leaving the toilet-seat up. When I was a child, I wanted to be a cop. As a teenager, I wanted to be a star. Now, I want a life. But all this time, I have always wanted someone in my life. Even as kids we have crushes on the little girl with the bow in her hair. Companionship is part of who we are. Why spend a life alone? A life is wasted if it is alone. Only together can we mean anything; I just realized that now, you know. Funny, though, I think I already knew it. I've always gone around saying (mostly to myself, mind you,) that a human being left to its own designs is a horrible and dangerous thing.  What lies ahead? What lies beneath? The same and the same. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tommorow...And what-have-you. I don't like what I see in my future. Whether it is truly there or not (even though there's a 99.99% that it IS), does not matter, as that is what I see. The image disturbs me.  Wherever you go, the past, present and future is always with you. You can do your best to ignore the past, but the human brain does not have the capacity to truly forget, the present is now, and the future is now, and now, and now, and it is forever where you are going. You can escape none of them; the terrible three you must accept.  Odd, the present is rather cumbersome. Er, maladjusted, er, whatever word you can find for it. Too many things are starting to make sense, too many things have been made clear to me, and too many things have been shown to these eyes. These things I do not need to see. I see them anyways. Odd, I could always have closed my eyes...Couldn't I?  My enemie's enemy is my friend. Is my friend's friend my enemy? What logic is that?  Demented logic for dummies.  Still in love, and listening to the song, too.  You know, the first time she ever enjoyed a Metallica song was my doing. I sent "Nothing Else Matters" to her to listen to, for reasons unknown at the time, and even now. Hm...  99th post...11th hour...New years eve...last day on Earth...   Exonerating...er...exterminating the human race one at a time, circa 1942.
