Noone reads through them, lyrics don't have the same impact that the music does. I know a girl who's profile and away messages consist of LONG depressing lyrics by many stupid bands, and i wish she'd stop this charade. She is one of the nicest people i know, but i think Macarthur got to her head. Jesus, that school blows.  I'm also sick and tired of adults looking down on teenagers as a bunch of  depressed losers that serve nothing more than a drain on society. It's time to rise up, you bunch of depressed losers that serve nothing more than to drain society!  You may not have noticed this about me, but I'm not like many other people. I'm a smart-alleck, but not in the way that makes teachers say "allright, enough out of you, TO THE OFFICE!!!"  I wish people weren't such assholes.  I know this post doesn't make much sense, my mind is just racing to beat itself right now.
