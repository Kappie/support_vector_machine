I walked into Rocks in Your Head in New York and asked the woman behind the counter,"What's new?" She put on "Smells like Teen Spirit." I thought,"Wow. Somebody managed to combine R.E.M. with Metallica." I had never heard the term Grunge, and I didn't know that I was going to be a phenomenon. I just knew I was listening to something profound: a great piece if music. Kurt Cobain captured the idea of having incredibly powerful feelings about having no feelings. I do believe Cobain was perfect, in a way: He was perfectly flawed."    Vernon Reid Commenting on Nirvana in Rolling Stone's "The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time"   Song of the Day: "Lithium" by Nirvana      RIP Kurt
