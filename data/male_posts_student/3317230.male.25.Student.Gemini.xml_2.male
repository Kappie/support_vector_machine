I thought Mount A was hilly, well City U has nothing but hills, but the hills are so steep there's stairs everywhere. There's actually a hiking trail through the campus. It's wierd, you can stop along your hike for a break, duck into a tunnel, and you're in the mall. Then you can grab a Shogun Burger at McDicks, or maybe some Salmon McPoppits, fried McShrimplings (if you eat that crap), and a Corn Pie for desert. But the one thing they unfortunately kept was that damn "I'm Lovin' It" slogan.  But that's if you're a filthy gwai-lo (ghost, derogatory term for a white foreigner) who can't resist McDonalds when there's much better food at the food court.   Let's see, the food court consists of: A sushi bar, a noodle bar, a barbeque w/rice bar, a noodle bar, and a noodle-soup bar. The KFC is on the other side of the skating rink.  But if you're  really  cool, like me, you go down 5 floors to the coffee shop and play Playstation2 for a few hours against some 10 year old chinese kid who kicks your ass in every game you play... EXCEPT Puzzle Bobble (Bust-A-Move), in which I skunked him eleven-nuthin! Doo doo doop! Doo doo doop! Doo doo doop dee doo dee WHOOPIE!!
