Now they have some really spiffy updates to the Composer tool - I haven't used all of them yet, but they look pretty sweet. So far it looks like they include autoformatting for:   Bullets  Numbred bullets  paragraph alignment options  Text colors  More font sizes  Block quotes  Uploading files  Remove formatting button   A pretty fair list of upgrades for a free service.   Google - you guys are cool.
