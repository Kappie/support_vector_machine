Extremely tired.  My dad drove me to La Salle, explaining in detail about the route I am supposed to take since I will be driving myself the next days.  Anyway, I found the building easy enough.  And I enter.  I waited in a lecture room and watching the people come in.  I was dissappointed that there was no one from my school so I was the only one.  Sitting alone.  But there were a few people who were alone too.  So we were alone, together.  Kind of.  I didn't have enough energy to socialize with people that early.  So I just kind of sat there and thought about the day before.  About Matt and stuff.  I still can't believe that I have a boyfriend.  It has been something I have wished about for the longest time.  Well, not exactly.  I had always wanted sexual relations with another guy.  But I have always wished to have a person that understands me or at least tries to understand me.  I want to be held and loved.  I want a person that is there for me, who cares for me.  And I think its an awesome thing that the person I have now is exactly what I wanted, as a boyfriend/lover and as a sexual partner.  Except we don't have "sex" which is okay by me.  What we're doing now is fine.  Anyway, the day starts.  We are ushered into a lab room and I find out that there are an odd number of people there.  So I volunteered to be in a group of three.  So it was fine.  The people there were nice.  Somewhat smarter than the people I usually deal with.  Which is great, actually.  The lab we did on the first day was DNA spooling.  I have done this before.  But I guess it doesn't hurt to do it again.  I was so tired, I couldn't really remember most of the day.  Lunch was okay.  All they gave us was a bottle of water.  Whatever.  Its funny to watch really social and outgoing people act.  Maybe not funny, but interesting.  But some of the partners in my group go to the same school so they already know each other.  I was one of the new people.  Which I didn't like that much.  Much more work for me to get to know them.  But I guess it wasn't too terribly hard.  Conversations ranged from the weather to college to how boring this lab is.  Jokes here and there.  And away we go.  I went home.  My dad drove me.  The route home was easier.  Let's see how I do tomorrow (today).    Yesterday night (July 6) I had a chance to talk to Matt.  Which I wanted to for the whole day.  So many things reminded me of him during the day.  Like the spoolled DNA looks just like cum.  And I couldn't help but think of him.  It was weird.  Anyway, we had the usual topics of what we did that day.  Nothing new and interesting.  And then we moved onto the topic of the e-mail he sent and the day before.    I told him what he did "wrong" and what he did "right".  He made a good observation.  He said that it seems that he is very hard to understand but very easy to please sexually.  And  I am somewhat easy to understand but very hard to please sexually.  Like opposites.  Its good.  Although I was somewhat offended when he said I was somewhat easy to understand.  I probably am, but I don't like to think of myself that.  I like to think that I am very complicated.  And I am.  Not that many people would think that I would be a person that has a boyfriend.  And not a lot of people know my secrets.  Except for me.    Then he said that it would be cool if I told him whenever I had an erection and he told me whenever he had an erection.  Which I thought was a weird request.  But I agreed.  And I do admit, it was somewhat a turn on to know.  But I would rather know in real life when he had an erection than over the Internet.  Since I would be able to at least look at his crotch rather or maybe do something more rather than just imagine and remember how his cock felt.  The conversation moved to my "confession" of how I felt about him moving away.  I said that I hated him for moving away.  I hated the whole thing.  I hated Japan.  I hated him.  Which is true.  Mostly.  But I know that he has no choice now.  And it is very selfish to wish that he's not going away.  I mean, he has an opportunity.  And I want him to be happy.  I might as well let him go.  To fly.  He and I then wondered if we will ever grow up to be married to each other.  And I said that it is possible, but I'm afraid that someone else will take him away from me.  And that makes me sad.  I mean, who can resist such a good and awesome guy?  I can't ask him to wait for me.  I can't say "Don't have any boyfriends.  I want to have you."  Thats just selfish.  But I want to.  I am willing to ward off any permenant relationships just to be with him.  But I can't ask him to do the same thing.  I can only wish for it.    Today, on the other hand.  Today was better.  I was more awake.  And I knew the people kind of.  Its weird how teenagers, I think, always are seeking for a relationship with some other teenager.  Like all they can think of is sex.  Or something.  Which in my past entries is all I can think about too.  But I keep it inside me.  I don't actively go out and try to go out with people.  But whatever.  I guess I'm just being hypocritical.  We did PCR, polymerase chain reaction.  Its the stuff that they do in CSI.  Which is cool.  We did a lab where we solved a crime.  It was easy and most of the time, we sat and chatted with each other.    I think I have a somewhat strong aversion towards new frienships.  Like I don't know the nature of them.  This girl that I met there, Danielle, asked me to walk with her to the parking lot.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just very interesting.  And she wants to know me better.  But I guess its cool that I can say "Yeah, I'm taken."  I just won't say by who, of any gender.  How do you feminize Matt?  Mabel?  Whatever.  I think a simple "Yeah, I'm taken" is enough.  I hope people never ask too much.  At least during the summer.  Because after the summer, I'm no longer taken.  Which would be a sad change.  But enough of that.  Drove home today.  Traffic is scary.  People are stressed and it is so hot outside.  I love driving with classical music on.  It feels like some movie experience with an awesome soundtrack.  I made it home okay.  I tried to lay down and sleep but the house prevented me.  Maybe I'll try again.  Speaking of trying again.  I still haven't masturbated.  Maybe I'll try that again.  When I came home from Matt's, I couldn't cum either.  Maybe I can now.  I hope someday, Matt can give me the best cum I've ever had.  Sorry for being graphic.  But I guess this is a blog, somewhat into my personal life.    Sigh.
