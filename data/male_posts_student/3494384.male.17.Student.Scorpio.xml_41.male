But my school is just beside your house.  :I need to get ready.  :Alright, make it fast then.  2pm in the afternoon, the sun is extremely hot, I stood under a shaded tree and fan myself.  Although it doesn't make much of a difference, it was better that I fanned.  5 minutes have passed, he's still not shown up, I was a lil' unhappy while looking at my watch.  10 minutes and he's still not here....couldn't be that he was met with an accident?  15 minutes passed, he finally shown up.  :Why are you so late?  He wasn't even a lil' bothered: Nahz, was watching TV.  :What?! TV?! Why don't you sleep, bathe and eat before you come down then?  I haven't got anything else to say for that, didn't take the helmet he handed me but stood there and stared at him.  :Sorry.  This was the first time he said sorry to me...  He is an egoistical person all along and has never once apologised to a girl.  I looked at him, Alright, took the helmet and let him sent me home.  He is always acting like this, no explanations,  no friction, no quarrels .  The only thing he does is to apologise. To me, somethings can't be settled with a sorry.  I would  never go on asking  after everytime he apologises.  He told me, that was the first time he said sorry to a girl.  Although it take courage to admit mistakes, he never once correct his mistakes.  Saying sorry became a word to  shut me up instead .  Tears flowed down my cheek on the 59th time he apologised.  I dropped my head: you don't ever need to say sorry to me again.   If you can never change, then don't let me keep giving you chances again and again hoping and believing that you would change each time.   He held me lightly, and said the 60th sorry.  Even then, he did not change, and there was no explanation whatsoever.  I began to worry if there was something he was keeping from me.  :What's wrong with you these few days?  :Nothing.  :Then why are you acting so strange?  :I am not.  :What can you say other than this answer?  :Do you know I'm very woried, very insecure,   do you treat me as your girlfriend?   :I'm sorry...  :I don't want to hear you say sorry again.  I put down the phone and he did not call back.  He doesn't even care about me. Maybe we should....break up.  ....this was the 99th time he said sorry...  From that day onwards, I never once called me or went to look for him.  Sometimes I get an anonymous phonecall  but everytime I said hello, it was dead, i think it's a call from him, but why don't he speak up?  After one month have passed, I couldn't contain the feelings I still have for him anymore and went to his school to find him.  I went outside his classroom and looked around, but there was no sign of him.  :excuse me, is XOXO here today?  :I'm afraid he already stopped schooling.  :Huh? Why? When was that?  :He hasn't been in school for a month already.  :Oh erms...thanks.  One month....not in school for one month...why is that so? I stumbled home.  Called his hp: Sorry the caller is currently unavailable, please leave your message after the tone....  I put down the phone, and called his house next, but there was no answer.  How can it be? The whole family migrated?  It seems as though he has already disappeared from the face on the earth leaving not even a single trace.  I couldn't find him....just as I was feeling distraughted, the phone suddenly sounded, it was my friend.  He was one of his brothers and also my good friend.  :Hey, what have you been doing? XOXO is in hospital.  :REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED?  :Oh he is in ZZ hospital, the one you stayed in last time.  :I'll be right there.  I used the fastest speed my legs could carry and when I reached the hospital I saw that his parents were already there.  I asked them for the room number and flew across the hall.  He was lying on bed, looking at me, not saying a word, not moving a muscle,  :Hey, what happened to you? Why didn't you contact me?  He did not answer, and used the same stare on me again.  :Come on answer me...why don't you speak?  A tear flowed down the side of his eye, and it looked as though he used the greatest amount of strength that he could master to say...  :I'm...sorry...  After that, his eyes went shut.  :Hey, don't fool around alright...why say sorry to me?  :Don't say sorry to me....please wake up....answer me please.  I wept and fell down on the side of his bed, pulling his shirt I cried out..  :Why do you have to apologise? Why don't you give me an explanation instead?  :I won't forgive you, wake up, saying sorry is no use...  :If you don't wake up I'll never ever forgive you in this lifetime, please I beg of you..open your eyes.....  That was the 100th sorry  A group of medical staff, doctors, nurses pulled me away and tried to revive him. I had no strength to stand up...  My mind was a blank.... my eyes could only see a sea of black.  He did not leave this world...I merely lost the chance to touch him anymore.  But he would appear in my dreams sometimes, telling me how he was doing.  He's still accompaning me, still alive, in my heart.  would still laugh at my silliness, and call me his darling....just that...he never apologise to me anymore.  After a month, his mom came to look for me, and gave me a box...inside was  a 100 photographs, everyone had a story behind them..the reasons why he made me angry.  The first time, my dear, I did not purposely arrive late to pick you up.  I know this excuse is really lame, but I didn't have the heart to tell you the truth then,  before I stepped out of the house, I felt a pain in my chest, but I still made it a point to meet you, please forgive me?  The second time, my dear, I...  The third time, my dear, I...  The 100th time, my dear, I didn't mean to leave you alone in this world,  It had to be so because God did not give me the chance to say I Love You for this lifetime of mine, and to put the ring on your finger....  You are the first girl I apologised to.  And also the first girl I want to be with for the rest of my life...  Forgive me for not able to bring you happiness but I have thus become your angel, always looking out for you...  Looking at you while you find your happiness...promise me...don't shed a tear...  I don't want to see you weep like this for me, I Love You ~XOXO  How can I not cry? What you said was just too impossible.  The last photograph was of him in the hospital,  Although he was skinny, the smile on his face was bright as ever.  His face was white and yet he tried his best to give his last smile on the last photo, the 100th.   At the time when he needed me the most, I wasn't with him.  :I'm sorry.   I held the photo tightly and cried for us.....
