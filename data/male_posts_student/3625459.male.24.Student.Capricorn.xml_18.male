Robs finised designing his thesis , all he has left is the implementation.  I was shit scared yesterday about my dissertation.Still think of her, jkeep tellin myself to let go.She replied saying that shes doing ok.No emotions in her reply,is it what im dreading of losing something that i never had ?I dont know ... ive lost a lot before already maybe this time it doesnt matter .. nothin matters.  all i do is sit and listen to punk rock, sad songs about heart aches and breakups.its helping i guess .. i'll be ok. always have always will. cant let go but i'll be ok .   am i missing mum ? in a way i do .. in a way i dont. mums are always there arent they?friends ..... are they aways there or do they just lose touch ... friends just leave   [random thought out of the blue]  think or her , it doesnt hurt when i miss her ... just that i see a lotta things that remind me of her .... i still dont know what im holding on to  [end-random thought out of the blue]  Got my project proposal typed in, the lecturer aint in. I'm leaving for london ( hope i get killed . or beaten up so that i end up with amnesia... i wont be missed by many except for mum and angel) well i wont remember and i'll end up with a spotless mind, isn't that a good thing     These NOFX guys write some really good lyrics . Been listening to a song called "where's my slice" the lyrics are interesting    We'll spend the day protesting all the problems that we're facing Anything but face reality  Where's my slice? I want more than equal rights I want everything for free!   Atleast they dont have weired anarchist theories like . who was the band that screamed "wake up... wake up.... " ... well u know whom i mean anyway  Im bored i'm off home to get some stuff and i'll head back here to start work.
