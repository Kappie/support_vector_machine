I went to my baseball game that wasn't rained out.  And about that baseball game.  Everything sucked up until about the fifth inning.  And even that inning sucked too, except for the fact that I hit a home run.  But, we still lost 7-3.  Who cares though? I hit a home run, which was the best thing that happened to the team all game.  That's all I really wanted to say so now I have to go finish the lawn. Bye.  ~JACK SPARROW~
