(to be specific, on that little crevice right above the heel on my left foot. but not too fast, it occasionally breaks out into rashes.) don't fool yourselves into thinking that's why i'm posting tonight, though. this blog is creative release and nothing more.   my dad, brother and i went to eat at sweet tomatoes today, and there was this one asian guy with really japanese-ish big eyes sitting forlornly at the wall farthest from the buffet. i don't know if any of you are concerned about this type of drivel, but i suddenly had a rush of thoughts. what i would wish for everybody in the world is to have a friend. not to the point of a soulmate, but just someone beside you to be a sounding board, a pillar of strength, someone to lean on or pretend your jokes are funny, a person to save you from the hurt of being alone. (and yet what's funny is that i relish my time by myself, so maybe i'm concerned for no real reason.) nevertheless, it's one of those self-perpetuating worries in the world, for once you recognize (any) need of one person, you become subsequently conscious of the same need shared by millions across the globe. and then what good does it do to help this one person who's down on their luck? why do they deserve your sympathy, your caring, your compassion more than anybody else deserves it? and the answer is simply that you're there and you can. just a thought.
