And speaking of Kelly I have new found respect for her (on top of the mounds of respect I already had)....teaching is   MUCH   harder than it looks....I only lasted an hour and 10 minutes of the two hours I was alotted....I really hope I don't have two hour sessions in the future.....it's hard trying to talk to a group of students who look like they really don't want to be there, especially when it's your first time teaching....Kel and Moms can have teaching....I know now that teaching cannot be a plan B at all for me....  In other news, I felt a part of me die on Saturday night after Mike Tyson was emasculated by Lennox Lewis....it was agonizing to watch after the 3rd round....being the true fan that I am I was pulling for Mike up until the 5th or 6th round (or maybe I just disliked Lennox Lewis   THAT   much)....but after that point I wanted Lennox to put him out of his misery....Mike looked terrible out there....a few friends and I have discussed the very real possibility that Mike was actually fighting on Zoloft or Valium because after the first round he just looked completely subdued....the man didn't even try to block the jabs after the 3rd round for Pete's sake!....  On another completely different note....I am once again at odds with myself on the whole notion of marriage....I know, I know.....why is this 23 year old black, male, medical student frustrating himself over something that he very clearly should not be thinking about?....I really wish I knew....but lately I have been feeling like I either will never WANT to get married or I will end up settling for someone....neither of those options is very appealing to me....maybe I should just not sweat it eh?....I'll try....  Anyway I should probably show up to Meharry soon....more to come later....
