School was alright like its been for a few days, i'm understanding some topics so I guess that's progress but i'm still gonna need to cover some revision on my own. Me, Xing and Amy felt really bored after school and didn't really wanna go home, so in the end we accompanied Mei Ling to town (: she was going for work! heh. We decided to walk around, and kinda did some shopping, well strangely enough it was 2 guys and a girl. laughs. I didn't buy anything tho, found the Joey Yung CDs I wanted! but, i'd be broke if I got all of them, sigh.   I'm not happy. Even though I shed a few smiles, I just wasn't happy. Things aren't getting better, i'm hurting people I love. I feel so tied down by problems everyday, what's different now is that I no longer know what I'm supposed to do, or can do to solve things. I haven't spoken to my 2nd sister for quite some time, and when i do she only replies with a few words, that's not a conversation. Owells.   I'm having my Photography workshop this Sat (: 10-1230, finally. I feel excited, for some reason.   I don't know if  you  are reading, you probably would a few days after i write this, maybe. I don't know if this is a self-confession of sorts, but I care for  you  and it just isn't the same being without you. I do have a good bunch of friends I can hang out with, i'm thankful, yet I feel i'm not truly happy sometimes. I wish you'd know I care so much for you, that i'm worrying every night about you, that I...would just wait quietly, for a simple message from you, that you care for me too. Nights like that feel terribly lonely, maybe i'm here without you.     [Iloveyou]       I'm losing my footing tonight, falling,will you reach your hand out to me? will you?
