It was great, because I got the impression that she's not really the type that would just blurt things out like that. She had a cool tattoo, though. She had to be home shortly after one, but Kylie and I weren't tired, so I stayed at her house for a bit. A long bit, actually.   Then work, home, blah blah blah blah blah....Last night. Last night. Went to movie with Kylie. Scary Movie 3. It's frosted flakes. Then played pool...I've been playing a lot of pool lately. It's a good game. Meh. This is lame. Completely not in the mindset to write right now.  I have teeth marks on my neck.   under my nose
