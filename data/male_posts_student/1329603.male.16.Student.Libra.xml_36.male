Generally took a long time and wasn't very interested but still...  After school, my head started hurting like hell so I decided to leave my paper round until tomorrow morning. Instead I went for a walk, and on the question of Samantha we went on a walk to my usual place by the stream. We spent a while there, and explored a bit and I got a wet arse >_  I got a nice new trackball mouse, and when you touch the ball (O_o) it glows blue. Hoorah. I like trackball mice, they're fun.  Anyway, watching Eyes Down. See ya.  Love, Jon Roskilly
