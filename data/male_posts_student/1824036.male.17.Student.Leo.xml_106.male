In those four days I have put about 8 hours of work, and I now know almost all of the notes on the entire guitar. Now I have been practicing pretty hard from what it seems like to me, and today I went over to Jadie's house. She picks up the guitar and my lesson book and learns everything that I know in about 15 minutes!  I was soooooooo pissed off! I couldn't believe it. I put in so much work into everything that I do, and no matter what it is, Jadie is better. I think the only that I can do better than Jadie is...I dont know...honestly. She is better than me at everything. This past year she got better grades than me! I couldn't believe it! I felt like the arm-pit of the world. I felt like everyone was looking at me thinking:   What a retard! He couldn't even get better grades than his girlfriend...AND HE WAS IN TAG HIS WHOLE LIFE!!!   I work hard, and get crap; story of my life. I hate it! I hate every second of it! I tell you if I was good at something I would probably keep it a secret. That way someone wouldn't find out and then become better than me.  I seriously think that something is wrong with me. Perhaps I have social anxiety disorder, mixed in with a little depression, and a lot of stress...hmmm...Maybe I'm just not fit for the outside world....maybe...  I hate my life!
