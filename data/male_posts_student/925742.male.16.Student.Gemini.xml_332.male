"  This of course is my usual, "I feel as if I'm going to fail in life because I am not challenging myself in high school" rant.  Like, why am I not taking Drivers Ed?  Oh, right, I'm young and an idiot.  Thats why I can take it in summer, instead of Upward Bound (though it does sound cool).  Or why not the tag classes or AP?  I think TAG sponsors the idea that kids are really special.  News flash: kids aren't that special.  Its better just to offer the AP and college stuff rather than inflate their dreams.  TAG may even be a waste.  The only way it is good is that it offers slightly more challenging work, but with a crowd of smart kids so that they don't have to be with the 'normals'.  Think about this:  if you're gonna be working with normals the rest of your life, why not work with them now in normal classes and progress up the bars of classes?  Gah, the idea of tag, to me, is like HitlerYougen.  Bunch of 'elites'.  Pssh.  And which leads me to AP and college credit.  AP, good idea, I'm getting my preliminary classes out of the way so that I may take AP next year. College credit?  Bad idea!  YOU NEED CLASSES IN COLLEGE.  You can't just take the college credit now, its stupid!  In college, you may need English or PE to cushion your GPA for when you do alright in the hard classes (college biology and chemisty and calculus, for me).  Those classes that may seem to be a good idea to take as college credit will screw you later, since you will just be getting B's and maybe even C's in the hard classes you wanted.  Just my 2 cents.  Hmmmmm, there now I feel like I'm making good choices for the future.
