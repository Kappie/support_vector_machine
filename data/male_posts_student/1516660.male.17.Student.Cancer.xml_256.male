I took quite a long time to bath, and went I came out, it was 9.20. Heh heh.  We went to 883 to eat breakfast. I ate chee cheong fun. Again. Yep! :) We met 510 (the orginal resident of my neighbour) Auntie. HaHa. She sat with us and we ate together lor. We chatted and chatted. Laraine's in P4! Oh my god! How time flies! I wonder if Laraine still recongise me. Hmm...  After that, I brought 8 Days and we went to Shop N Save to shop. Shop ar shop ar. Mother brought a lot of things and chatted with her colleages. Staff favoritism! The packer opened a new box og grapes for Mother. HaHa! We brought more stuff la. I forgot what. I was busy reading my 8 Days. Then, we brought more stuff and we went home.  Woah! We reached home at 11. I went online lor. HaHa. Yesterday I posted some theories of my own to solve a mystery. The creator said I am good at this. Even though a lot of people knows the answer, I am still gonna solve it on my own (with some prodding by the creator la). HaHa. I posted more theories of my own. :) I am so excited!! I wanna solve it!  After that, we went to 768 to eat lunch. There was a intense discussion on where to buy yu sheng. 883 or 768? They are still deciding. Today's Ren Ri. In Chinese tradition, it means today is everyone's birthday. HaHa. We everytime eat yu sheng today one. Actually, within these 15 days, we would at least eat yu sheng about 4 times. HaHa. We are yu sheng freaks.  Coming back from lunch, I went to play my PT. HaHa. This time, I played for about 4 hours. I levelled about 3 levels to level 10! Woo-hoo! I finally learnt how to Heal myself. Moo meow meow! After playing, I went online for more theories guessing. In a discussion, one guy slammed Singapore by saying "at least it is not like some poor countries like Singapore where people work for 12 hours and get 15 cents". I was so totally pissed off! Even the 'lowest' jobs (cardboard collectors) earn enough to feed themselves for the day. I told him off lor. You must find it totally unKY-ish. After all, I am not much of a patriotic citizen. Come on lor. He makes it sound like EVERYONE is earning 15 cents a day. Singapore is a modern and cosmopolitarian city. I wonder where he gets his facts from. He is such an idiot!   I had my dinner next. It looks like Dad is going to Balestier to get the roasted pig (whole pig) for tomorrow's praying. I am going with him. :) We are taking the MRT and bus first, then Dad's taxi friend (9293) is fetching us. HaHa. I read my book (The Tangle Box) until 7.30 when I came online.  Oh my! It looks like there's Charms essay. Hmm...I must do it. For more galleons! Meow moo!   Alright, I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
