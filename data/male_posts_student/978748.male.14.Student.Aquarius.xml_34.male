Pretty much the same thing as the day before except this time erinn got to go yay!  oh and we saw the stepford wives which imo was more comedy than anything else.  I didnt get to buy anything tho cause the store i wanted patches and stuff from was already closed when we got there.  uhm, wat else... oh, stefans dad beat me at air hockey.  and yeah, thats it/
