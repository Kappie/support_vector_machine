It also worked perfectly with me having done the dumb thing of reading "African World Revolution" that is the one book that could actually pull me away from Socialism if I read it in one sitting.  Speaking of which, Thomas showed me a "Bloomcounty" which bothered me.  It was talking about how "Ebony" is an all black magazine, and that if a similar all white magazine existed it'd be labelled racist.  The same problem comes up on the egroup I am part of "Anarchist People of Color".  People seem to think that the minority can't have it's own groups, but being in the majority means the minority can't be stretched thin enough to be included... If that makes any sense.  This may continue on.  I've tended to notice, especially after Bamboozled a pretty bothering trend.  Michael Rappaport, the CEO of CNS in the Movie, says "Nigga, nigga, nigga, I don't care what Spike Lee says, I agree with Tarantino, it's just a word."  I let that sink in, and that general speech that followed.  I can't really put it into words, because my opinion is strongly lacking.  I tend to notice people laugh at me when I say I want to be a teacher of elementry school.  Most people consider that a "low job" only fit for women and gay men (I wasn't gay last time I saw a naked guy, then again the last naked guy I saw was myself).  This is clearly horseshit, and is a serious problem.  Mrs. Skeete (should I say Doctor Wise) was saying that she had a program in Patterson trying to get students to return to the district as teachers because their is a huge lack.  Going to Newark, I tend to see this, especially with the blonde hair, blue-eyed, Aryan principal at McKinney (or whatever the hell it was called).  That really explains alot, that means these kids have their brains completely reduced to mush at a young age especially the males, and especially the males who don't have fathers.  The only black men they are gonna see are on the streets (which usually means that's another black down the drain), on Television (I hate tv as a rule), or as the damn janitor.  Please tell me you see the problem.  Then you have white teachers, who are mostly women, bearing down on these children trying to give them education.  The first effect is that these people are foreign if the area your from is mostly black, and  Mestizos .  So you've got Black guys who see white women as the smartest people in the world from a young age.  So that means even if they get educated, they aren't going to see black girls as worthy.  Then you have black girls who seeing how smart their wonderful white teacher is, figure they can't get a smart black guy because he'll want the smart black girl, so they end up with some trashy ass wanna-be thug.  I can even see that at Columbia, please tell me someone else is bothered by girls who settle for less.  This is one of the reason I feel a need to be a teacher.  Although I generally consider working for the government a bad thing, I tend to have marginally more faith in local government.    Okay, my fingers want me to type more.  I usually don't confront people on this, I've only done it twice.  People generally say, "Marcus, your so white."  What the hell does that mean?  If you can find a definition that shows that our country hasn't diluted your mind with racism please, tell me.  The way I see it is, because I don't follow anything of what's shown on tv, and I act more how I choose (well I guess I do appear to fit in a certain niche),  then I'm suddenly "not down".    Wow.  I guess I usually never say something because I'm comfortable with my identity.  Gangs.  This is a key issue in our community that really pisses me off.  It's some fantastical bullshit.  We have the wonders of white flight playing out fullswing in the High School, and suddenly when black people start doing funny handshakes, or acting like thugs then suddenly we have a gang problem.  What the hell does the gang do? Steal cars? Nope.  Sell drugs? No, other people already have that market.  Then what the hell do they do?  Even more then that, this issue of gangs seems to be playing into alot of fights.  Nia tells me about the same thing in middle school, and fortunately the rage she feels from seeing black people always fighting each other has surfaced.  I can agree. Nothing pains me more then seeing black people physically fight each other.  It says something, since I can expect to see some form of a fight everyday at lunch or hear about the aftermath of one.  Who sees this?  Who forms opinions about this?  What does that say you think about yourself?  Fuck game.  I'm sick of typing.
