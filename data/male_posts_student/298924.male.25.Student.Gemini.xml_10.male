Okay why am I so fly today....usually I don't toot my own horn but I have to admit I look the part!....I have on my spotless white coat and a shirt and tie picked out especialy to accentuate my charcoal Calvin Klien pants....I am the man!  Me and the homie Nicole (I hope you can find a spare minute or two for a brother over Christmas break :-)...) are having  a "discussion" about the trend towards these Black male authors writing these pseudodrama novels....I find the whole thing to be terribly exploitive and a waste of trees....almost as bad as Terry McMillan (there is no way one good black male per novel can balance out the negative examples she throws at you)....I can't figure out who is doing more damage to the psyche of black males....it seems that the only characters with positive characterizations are a)men who are already married and serve as the token "good black man", b)gay and proud,  c)a child or son who has yet to be tainted by the evil that is manhood, or d)the one who makes a dramatic change for the better?....Black males get bashed enough in the media...anyway that's just my humble opinion....  On a completely different note....I am trying to figure out why I like Howard Stern's show so much....I mean he is blatently exploitative....he makes fun of the mentally and physically challenged....yet I get a kick out of watching him and Beetlejuice and Hank the Angry Drunken Dwarf(RIP)....sometimes he is downright disgusting....but I can't figure it out....I guess we all have our vices, and my enjoyment of Howard is mine....
