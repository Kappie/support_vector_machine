No one has touched it because it is a gruesome butchery of poetry and I need to apologize for it. I shall ask Alanna soon if I can delete it. Totally remove it. That sounds correct.  Little brother's birthday today, he turns eleven and gets a load of cash that I envy. Lucky foolish child, he gets his birthday when he is around everyone else he knows. I had my birthday trapped at Bridge Builders. Not fun.  Today's random quote which made me come here and post: "The English don't necessarily pronounce everything right. They just say it the loudest." Said by Miss Lovely British Accent Janet Baker-Carr. I love the British accent and vocabulary. She asked me if my school bade ill for the rest of the year. I will steal her voice one of these days.  You know what I forgot to mention on accounts of Becca? Morgan Fox opened the night with beautiful poetry. He played few wicked pieces on the synthesizer and it was quite melodious and fluid and enrapturing.  I can't see my companions today due to "family matters", i.e., a birthday, but I shall have to talk to some of the later to reaffirm my sanity or lack thereof.  Cheers, humans.
