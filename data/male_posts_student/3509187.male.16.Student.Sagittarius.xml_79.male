After school I went to the eye doctor for my last appointment concerning contacts, I hae 8 boxs now... set for a year... that makes me pretty darn happy... glass really are annoying... after the eye doctors, my mom and I met my sister before work. While in Panera it started to rain really hard and that made me really happy... I love Rain.  Lucky for me, it was till raining when we left.  Hmm Rain...  Well... next order of buisiness... I've got to pass on a situational question that Miss Angie D asked me and asks a bunch of people... An evil dictator takes over the world and tells you that everyone Highschool age and up must choose a spouse.  No devorce or Cheating allowed.  You must be able to spend forever with them and it doesn't matter if they like you back or not.  If you have a significant other pretend you don't and answer me this... Who would you choose?  Well then... I will talk to all of you later... and make sure you leave comments... I promise more Duct Tape pictures to come.  -Dan V
