Im pretty excited about it. a lot of people are getting into airsoft so this is good, more people to play with. you need to get a gun, yes.... YOU. im not talking about these pansey spring pistols, im talking the real deal. the AEGs, tokyo mauri assualt rifles. if you already have one, get another one and give your old one to the "people who dont have one" foundation so we can get more people to play!  man with my new gear its gonna make the movie that were making about the terrorist / hostage thing a million times more awsome. jon and i are gonna look hardcore. so anyway, off the airsoft topic...  mike wrote some really depressing blog, seems everyone is becoming more emo by the day. on a more joyful note, i got my big white tent up in my yard! we put the ping pong table in there and were working on putting the foosball table back together. finally there will be something to do at my house when people come over. im even thinkning of setting up my N64 or PS2 out there. that would be rad.  welp summer is getting closer and closer, i cant friggin wait! its gonna be awsome, even though everyone will be working, the times that were not will be fun enough to make up for the hours of working boredom. and we'll all have money like grapefruit. agh man i cant wait. welp tyler and i want to go to the beach, but every day i have off, he doesnt, and every day he has off, i dont. we'll have to go next week sometime... bah, guess thats life.  welp time is ticking away, better start my end credits:  John Hansen - flowing hair like an angel. he is a fellow airsofter and his shotgun perspires with majesty. john is like an elf, graceful but deadly, because he is deadly??? john sits in baskin robbins for hours on end making beautiful music. if john were a food i would eat him.  current historical text - rule of reign 1949-1976 current currency - houston
