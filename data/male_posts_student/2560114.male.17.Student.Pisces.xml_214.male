Some of these songz i actually liked, but some of these songz i cannot believe i liked...haha, as song taste change through time. I so want to b on those showz like "i love the 90s" or like something to where i could criticize the thingz i like and the thingz that r totally horrid, that would b the job for me. Then as i turn the channel to watch the laker game, i rememberd how i use to b such a laker fan, i mean when i was in japan jus representin the lakerz and all the haterz, it was good stuff. then as time took its toll, i began to jus not care about the lakerz, like if they win thats great and if they lose, sux for them. man, i loved living overseas, it was jus makin new friendz and like learnin new culturez and learnin the language, it was challenging yet worth while, i would love to experience those thingz again. Maybe, if vball takez me somewhere in the future, i might play overseas and do what i did in the past, that would b sooooooo awesome. Or i could jus b an english teacher and go to foreign countries and have my own class and teach...that would b awesome aswell. well ill leave on this note...bored bored bored bored bored bored...payce.
