Listening is the only thing keeping me sane. People are fascinating.  Take, for example, tonight. I was listening to a middle aged woman teaching a woman from Taiwan English. They were going down a list of words, apparently, that start with B, and their definitions. "Buck." said the woman. "Is another word for a dollar. I have two bucks, I have two dollars." The woman from Taiwan repeated the word. "Bum." she said, moving down the list. "Is a person who lives on the street, and asks people for money. A bum will generally use this money to buy liquor. This is different from a homeless person..."  The absolute simplicity was what I liked about this. Black and white-ness, I guess.  This conversation brought me infinite joy. Bliss, even.  Find happiness in the very simple things. It's the only way to find it.
