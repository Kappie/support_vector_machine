Spiderman 2 is actually that good. Where the first Spiderman flick failed, the sequel has prevailed. Where all superhero movies since the first Superman have disappointed, Spiderman 2 does not. It is truly a milestone in film history, and hopefully a standard for upcoming superhero flicks (Fantastic Four, Ironman).     The first Spiderman film pitted the web-slinger against the increasingly insane Norman Osbourne, aka the Green Goblin. This time around, there's a new crazy scientist in town. Dr. Atto Octavius, when a fusion demonstration goes wrong, has a set of mechanical, intelligent tentacles fused to his spine. His wife is killed as a result of the experiment, and he goes mad.    We see a new kind of villian here. He is not inherently evil, nor is he totally in control of himself. He is a sad character, who only wishes to fulfill his dream. And we sympathize with him in that aspect. We almost wish his plan would work, just so he could be happy again, like he was prior to the experiment.     We also see Peter Parker, struggling to save the world and do his homework on a daily basis. He's stressed, confused, naive, and madly in love with a girl he could not possibly have. He's delivering pizzas to make ends-meat and living in a slum of an apartment with a Russian tennant who does nothing but whine for the rent. Oh, and he's losing his powers.     I never thought I'd feel sorry for Spiderman. I mean come on, he's muscular, he's fast, he's strong, he can scale buidlings, and he can soar through the sky with a mere flick of his wrist. But while watching this movie, I truly felt sorry for the character of Peter Parker. That's one of the marvels of the film.     The action and special effects (the frosting and sprinkles on the cake of plot and ice-cream of characters) are amazing in this film. The epic battles between Doc Ock and Spidey are phenomenal. You'll wince as Octopus tosses Spiderman effortlessely through a building across the street, and cringe as Spiderman beats past his mechanical terror tentacles to beat the living snot out of his face. There is so much passion and emotion in this fight scenes, because both men are fighting for their very fates and the fates of others.     Spiderman 2 is truly an amazing film. I don't doubt that it could be the first superhero film in history to be nominated for the Oscar. It is a movie that stands above the rest with a solid, interesting plot and characters, amazing special effects, pumping action, and enough romance to suit anybody's needs. If you haven't seen it, you should be shot. See it. NOW.
