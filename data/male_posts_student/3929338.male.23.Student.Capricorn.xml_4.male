I wait for the day that I become a D.O. for I shall work in the E.R. and systematicaly commit all of management to .. lets say Bellvue. Yes I realize that's in New York. I'm hoping that if we crews continue on our present course that eventually management will be helpless and therefore it will be no easier for them to find their way back than it is for my patients to get away from needles. But what do you expect when your job description is "Strap a person down, stick with sharp object, repeat."    Of course this meeting went its standard route. "I'll fire you all. Blah blah. Suspension. If you make me lose my job I'll shoot you. Blah blah." Then our "dispatch manager," if you say it really fast it sounds like "dick scratcher" which is pretty much HER job description, starts going off on her little tyrade to her "chosen ones." Little does she know we crews have infiltrated her little Inner Circle. She begins yelling. Again. Then we hear. "Its not any trouble for them. Its not like these crews do anything anyway."    Silencehappened. Well. Except for her mouth, the cricket that tried to chirp got sucked in. This was news. Getting up at 0300 to go do an out of town trip or a stupid little local discharge must be a figment of our imaginations. Mass hallucination when she gives us all trips to go do or screams at us to go outside and clean our trucks, for the tenth time that day, because some big-wig who never shows up is "coming." I think it gets her wet or something, because usually she's got the washing machine on spin when this is happening. My question is this. If I don't do anything, then why does this chick dispatch us all while she's sleeping? Logic only serves to follow that if WE don't do anything then neither does she because she has to do something for us to do something, so if we're not doing anything its her fault for not sending us.    This only serves to back up my conclusion that we need Zoloft dropped into the water supply.    I love my job.   I love my job.    I love givinghandjobs..    oh..    wait..    I think I was channeling her spirit while I slept.
