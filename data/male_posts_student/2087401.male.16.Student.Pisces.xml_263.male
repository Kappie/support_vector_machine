I think that the fact that I'm super pmsing *I know ya'll didn't want to know that, but figured it might explain something*, and suspect that I have the flu might just have put enough stress on me to act like a major bitch.  I don't know.  I'm sorry for doing whatever I did and for having a hard time.  Please forgive me.    Michael: Thanks for standing up for me...I think...lol I didn't really understand what you were doing with that post, but I recognized that you were telling Marten off just as much as you were telling me off.  So thank you.  Nathan: yeah, as you can tell, girls are weird.  We're all weird.  It's just part of our physiology...I'm surprised there isn't a specific gene that makes a specific protein (Woo hoo Mr. Lamishaw's class!) that makes us stranger than you.  Who knows.  But, yeah, it's the whole "I want what I can't have" mindset that's making these chicks *did I just say chicks?!* swoon over you.  and I'm happy that you're happy with Ashley!  :D
