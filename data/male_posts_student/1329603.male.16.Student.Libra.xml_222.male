Although Tom Lowe came in and we had a natter, Tom G and I went to the music room and made up songs about body parts (It's The Eye to the tune of On My Own being one), and Joe T has helped me with my maths. In a 45 minute revision period I did 2 questions. In the words of the immortal Mini-Me... EEE! I've revised 4 subjects in total and I intend to do some music at 3... although I fear I've forgotten my books. If I have, I shall just not revise the music. I need 50% for an A*, so I'm not aaaall that fussed. I will be if I don't get 50%, though. I'll be livid. Jon Gwenlivid Thomas Roskilly.  It struck me today; I'm going to go and see Bill Bailey in a week and 2 days. Only one word can describe that realisation... WOOYAY!  Yes... Rhiannon sent me an email, which has made me miss her. She's cool and I see her not much. I see Zoe even less i_i... I see Sam barely ever but I think that's better on account of otherwise I fear I'd get killed. Possibly. Actually, quite probably.  One day more, until my exam in German list'ning, and also then in Music listening. The board who do not know the time will mark my paper in the line, one day more. "I did not revise until today, I woke up and my hair was parted. Tomorrow, I'll be in the hall, ah crap, my exams will have started."        Or not.  Quote of the day: "Told my girl what I wanted to be, She said "Baby, can't you see, I wanna be famous, a star of the screen, But you can do something in between."  From The Beatles'   Drive My Car   Love, Jon Roskilly
