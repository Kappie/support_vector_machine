She seems like a nice girl.. but I just don't know what to say to her when I finally work up my guts and finally put it down on the line. I've been thinking of writing a poem or a lovenote or something. But I suck at that kind of stuff. I've been getting my friends to tell her the stuff that I need to tell her, but I can't just use my friends as messenger boys. I've also been using  her  friends that I like her, and that's the way the thing is getting started.. I can feel my heart sink to the bottom of my stomach when she passes me in the hallway.. I sit behind her in study hall, drawing detailed sketches of the back of her head. Her locker is about 20 lockers down from me, and she's friends with the girl that's in the locker next to mine. I danced with her in 5th grade one time.      I just don't know what to say.
