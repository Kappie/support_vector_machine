The answer to all three of these questions is no of course.  And NO I haven't started effing with shrooms....I don't even eat them on my food.  No, I have been affected profoundly by the game GRAND THEFT AUTO 3.  Yes, this game is the greatest game ever.  It has combined all of my secret fantasies of death, destruction, and gratuitous violence.  I can drive as recklessly as I want with little consequence.  I can beat cops like stuck pigs!  Am I sick?  Quite possibly!  Is GTA3 the best game ever?  Of course!
