I really didn't read my book, so now I'm going to write an analysis of a book that I didn't even finish the first chapter of...It must be the end of the school year.  I really hope Motter doesn't stumble upon this site because she'll saw my balls off with a butter knife or something, we'll see how it goes.  This evening consisted of trying not to fall asleep to the lulling sound of the rain and talking to friends.  My room is way too hot and opening the windows isn't helping argh! I'm trying to not think of finals as much as I can.  A couple teachers this year have pulled the whole "I'm not going to leave any time for review, you can do that on your own"  Instead I hear... " Keep your grades up as much as you can because you're going to screw yourself with the finals"  YEEHAW RoCk On! I hope everyone had an amazing memorial day despite the weather.  I hear we get yearbooks tomorrow. That makes me excited.  I can taste summer - The only thing I still need is a job.  I'm applying at the Autoport tomorrow, that would be exciting.  Alright well I need to read some Lord of the Flies sparknotes and hit the pillow. Holla back Motter!  Peace  Chad
