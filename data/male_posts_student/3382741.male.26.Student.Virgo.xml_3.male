(at least not for a long time).  with a b/f its a little different tho and i wanted to hear from him so bad that i messaged him this morning.  just wished him a good day ... and he messaged back and said "baby i miss you so much".  how can i stay mad at him when he says things like that?  but it was like nothing at all that we didn't talk yesterday ... i bet he forgot that he was going to call ... but he didnt even message me all day .. sooo unusual... geeze i am messed up worrying about this so much.  i really dont mean for my b/f to take up so much of this blog ... just seems to be what is on my mind mostly now.  well that and linux ... ugh there is another nightmare.  i learned that it is a bad thing to let the linux partition get completely full.  it won't boot now.  i am actually dlding another version of linux (one that runs completely off a CD) just so i can resuce the one I already have installed.  partition magic can't modify the size of a linux partition apperntly ... (in fact its now unable to modify the ntfs partition on my laptop and i don't know why) .. only 3 and half more hours to dld the CD iso.  more later
