More thoughts  urlLink here .  Can't say I'm surprised. Nor is this very interesting from my perspective. The law said it was illegal at the time and a mayor simply doesn't have the right to overrule state laws. Now, if there is a legal challenge to the law then that is a ruling I might have more interest in.  The primary reason I link to it here is just to point out the fact that this ruling really has absolutely no effect on the national debate except from an overblown symbolic effect. This is a legal matter that was pretty cut and dried. I think it is a good example of the liberal stance of most California courts that there were even 2 dissenting votes to begin with.  Now, I'm against same-sex marriages, but just because I don't support it doesn't mean that I approve of the ruling - the ruling was based on a legal matter and the law is clear in regard to same-sex marriages. They are simply not legal in California. For a judgement to have any lasting effect on the national debate someone has to challenge the constitutionality of the current laws on the books or manage to pass legislation that either solidifies the current legal standards (and survives the inevitable legal battle that the supreme court would be forced to address) or makes it legal to have same-sex marriages (and also survive the inevitable legal challenge which would also make it to the supreme court).  No matter what your views are on this issue, you need to realize that this is an issue that, despite any legislation one way or another, is going to eventually be settled in the courts. I'm not totally clear on the politics of it, but I think the only way to avoid involving the courts in that issue is to have the issue incorporated into a constitutional ammendment. That would be an extremely interesting story to watch the outcome of which is far from pre-determined (see: prohibition). Same-sex marriage is not an issue that will go away quietly and will take a long and protracted battle to settle it one way or another.  Not that I'm saying anything new or earth-shattering here.
