Today I just worked and went to see Shrek. It was funny! You really need to see it. I think it was personally better than the first. Oh, and when the credits start, DON'T LEAVE. There is a surprise at the end.  To You Know Who: Congratulations on Graduation. I love you so much, and I hope you take your graduation and do great things with it. I can't wait to see you in August!    Limerick  One very long, boring day,  Jimmy was tickling Ray,  It got out of hand As they rolled in the sand,  And it all got decidedly gay.
