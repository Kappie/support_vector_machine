Let me tell you how stressful asking for more money again and again and again and again.       I am just tired of fighting with the university to get anything done or to just graduate. Why does it have to be so dam hard to get the financial aide necessary to graduate and do something with my life. I thought the schools purpose was to help people achieve a higher level of education. Yet I face more stress just to get the money to come to school then I have ever faced before. Hopefully if I do everything right I will get some aide by November. Ok that is today's gripe.       On the happy note. I start earning my hours towards internship I have to earn a total of 600 hours, 250 of them in direct client contact. Mathematically that comes out to close to 40 hours of work each week, and 20 of those hours in contact with clients. I think that it will be a great experience and I know I will learn a lot. So wish me luck. :p
