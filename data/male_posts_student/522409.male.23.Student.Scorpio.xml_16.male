They're all amazing.  Victor Sandman from BU, Greg Binstock from Tufts, Mark Manley from UVA, and Aithan Shapira from Brandeis.  This is going to be an incredible summer.  Countdown, for the record, is 4 days.  Speaking of the Sound, an abridged version of the 2K1 group did 2 shows this past weekend in Falmouth with the Falmouth Mostly Men's Chorus and Notescape.Cod  We had a lot of fun, and it was the last show any of us will perform with Jason Taylor (JT) for 2 years and 3 months, as he leaves June 18th for a stint in Belize as part of the Peace Corps.  Amazing party for Heidi/Bonk's birthday on Friday night at Coogan's Bluff in Faneiul Hall.  Considering the number of Hyannis-types who live in the Boston area, we don't get together NEARLY enough.  4 days til the reunion of the century.  Year.  Whatever.  Groove went to SF to compete in the Harmony Sweeps finals.  The competition was incredible.  The people were some of the most genuine and wonderful I've ever met, and I've developed a new love affair with San Francisco. (although I don't think I'll ever develop a similar love affair with the plane ride out there until the Concorde is in my price range)  We did not win.  And I don't think any of us cared.  It was an incredible show to be a part of... a career experience for all of us, I think.  The audience?  I defy you to find a better one.  They were so energetic and supportive and... just... wow.  Speaking of competition, I went to the ICCA finals in NYC on April 28th.  On the Rocks, the group I worked with in Oregon placed 3rd in the nation in their second year of existence.  Another career moment for me, hearing my arrangements sung in the indescribably beautiful Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.  The show was amazing; the groups truly rose to the occasion.  And the record-shattering audience was again, wonderfully supportive.  Speaking of the ICCAs (this string of transitions is truly masterful, is it not?  No Jim, it is not.  But carry on...), I won the job I was interviewing for.  I'm producing the Northeast and New England/Central Canada regions for the ICCA next year.  8 shows, and interest from hosts and competing groups who've never shown interest before... I'm very excited.  All in all, it looks to be an exciting year for me and the ICCA. ::knocks violently on wood::  I'm also in charge of selecting the performing groups for the two biggest a cappella shows in the Eastern US this year: the Collegiate Showcase and the Gala Concert at the East Coast A Cappella Summit.  Stay tuned for more details, but don't be surprised if you see Australia's finest, The Idea of North, and Juno-winners Cadence in the Gala lineup. ::grinning ecstatically::  4 days til the Cape.  That means lots of packing to be done here.  And I need a haircut.  And to do laundry.  And to go home and see Mary, because she's going to be gone all summer and I'm going to be gone all summer and I'm going to be busy all fall and she's going to be in Moscow all spring and... see?  Need to see Mary.  I'm planning a trip to Cape Breton.  I can't wait to go.  It's been a secret little dream of mine since spring break freshman year at UNH when I met some folks from Cape Breton at a pub on St Patty's Day in Quebec City.  It seems like paradise on Earth, and I can't wait to escape up there for a week or two in the fall.  Early indications are that my good friend Jesse will be joining me.  She'll be studying in Montreal in the fall and Geneva in the spring.  Looks like I'll be travelling to Russia and Switzerland in the spring.  Woohoo!  Hopefully I can squeeze London in, too.  Oooooh... Bobbie will be in London in the fall.  Bingo.  World traveller, baby.  World traveller.  I think that's all for now.  I'm about ready to burst.  To the people of San Francisco, I love your city.  To the people of Cape Cod, oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my goodness 4 days.  Get ready.    May the Road...
