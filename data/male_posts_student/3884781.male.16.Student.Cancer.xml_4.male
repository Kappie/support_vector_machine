This, i promise, will not be terribly interesting, as the only real purpose of this post is to write some utter crap to start the ball rolling, and to test to see if this thing works.   let us start with one thing that really annoys me: people who make a habit of eating a Kitkat, without breaking it in half first.   Why?   The Kitkat is clearly designed to be broken into individual pieces to aide the ease of consumption.   What is the psychology behind this confusing habit? Leaving the Kitkat as a whole and attemping to eat it all at once is an arrogant gesture, a sign that you feel you are superior to other Kitkat eaters, and therefore do not need to break it in half in some pandering to convention. But this convention makes sense! Who wants to see some idiot attempt to stuff a whole Kitkat in his mouth and get half the chocolate arround his mouth instead of in it, just because it looks clever?   Or it could be that you just couldn't be bothered, which frankly is even worse. I have nothing to say to you accept BURN SOME OF THOSE CALORIES, BREAK IT IN HALF! Having said all this, it could just be an attempt to 'mark yourself out of the crowd' which is just sad, GET A LIFE!
