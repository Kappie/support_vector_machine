I really am giving constructive criticism but it might be too much for u too handle. Had a talk and discussion wif Jie Hong n Kin Leong abt me going too far and me being in deep trouble. I dun really mind as long as i made my mark however most of my remarkz were really misunderstood. I neva wanted to bring the club up myself but together with u all bring the club up. together. I juz wanna be a helper. to noe and understand what is going on. not being thrown ard juz to play. Tatz how we feel as players. I'm reallie sorie to put u in such a bad mood but it was neva meant to blast ani1. Not even a single person. Anger reveals the evil in evri1 and i was stupid to succumb to it. Sorie man. I'll shake hands wif ya somedae on saturdae on the nxt trg ya? As to the rez of the management,i'm sorie guyz n galz alike. I'm speaking on behalf of the rez of the guy playerz. Oh yeah, Jie Hong told me about the exhibition match and stuffz. I neva meant to ask the hall of the booth. I was asking for the hall in fc3~ Aniwae,thankz for evriting the whole management haf done for the club. I'm reallie sorie to all..  Yours Sincerely, Mohd Akil   If there's aniting u all wanna tok abt feel free to approach me on msn. I should be there moz of the tym. Thankz.
