After school, I was packing/talking-ish and Nima came over and gave me a white stuffed bear that was holding a rose-ish thingy. From Wonderland, I know. Haha. Cuteness. :)  Went to try on my grad dress after school, still fucked. Had to go to Korean supermarket with mom and get stuff and got some ice-cream from the ice-cream truck nearby. Also grabbed some guitar stuff from Yamaha Music Gallery. Then went to Nima's place for dance. Talked, hung out, danced. Yup.   Finally got a chance to blog. Gotta go to dinner now. I'm off. Peace.  3 days until 100th day into our relationship. (Thursday)  I love you.
