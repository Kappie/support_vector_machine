Here is a list of things he said he did but he lied about:     Spine transfer from the big bowl to the medium one (there is a small, medium, and big one)  Ollie into the small bowl  Rock to Fakie in the medium bowl  Tail stall in the medium bowl  Ollie a cone (about 4-5 decks high) off a ramp   Yep, he's full of shit alright. He just lies about stuff so he doesn't sound like he sucks (which he does, really bad).  When I was at the skatepark, I saw one of my friends from school (name is Jordan). He was at someone's graduation but he got bored and came into the skatepark to skate with me and it was pretty fun. I'm going up there with him again next Saturday. Well that's about allI have to say now. I just drank a cup of cappucino so I'll be staying up late tonight.
