Is Saddam willing to give us today to debate why  urlLink About Schmidt  didn't get a Best Picture nod, and how both  urlLink Y Tu Mama Tambien  and  urlLink Talk To Her  could get Best Screenplay nods, but get jacked out of even Best Foreign Film.  Is there a rule that if you write a non-English film and get accolades in another category, you can't be up for the silly foreign award?    If  urlLink Chicago  beats  urlLink The Pianist  for Best Picture, I will indiscriminately kick people in the face.    More Academy Awards...I don't know whether I'm more excited to see Michael Moore on the stage where Charlton Heston stood years before (it's not the same stage, but play with me for a minute), or to see Eminem tell Meryl Streep to fuck herself.    How am I supposed to wait for the awards show?  I guess that's what war and terror and American fear are for.  Well played, George W!  Who is going to save the world?  The sociologists (capitalization left out because it looks too much like Scientologists), the cultural theorists, or Jesus?  My money is on  urlLink Cindy Pierson Dulay  and the  urlLink Cyberspace Racing Team  in the 5th at Santa Anita Downs.  10 furlongs on dirt.
