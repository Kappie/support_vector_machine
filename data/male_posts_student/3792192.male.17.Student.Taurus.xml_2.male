I did remember to keep a journal of the events while being aboard the Excelsior, so I am gonna try to type up as much of it as I can. So, here it is.  22nd July 2004. Time: 21:28  It's been a rather long and interesting day. The taxi arrived on time and I was at Southampton Central early, so no problems. The ride from there to the airport took a few uneventful hours. A few problems in a crowded airport followed, nothing serious, it was dealt with without too much stress.  First time flying, that was interesting. Within a few seconds of takeoff I was looking down through the window at the coutnryside, the flight didn't take long though, but it is interesting to feel the effects of turning and the landing. Once we arrived at the excelsior I was able to see it properly for the first time. There is a nice amount of deck space, at the stern a place where I now sit writing this entry. After exploring, and decideding on sleeping arrangements we had a crew parade. Walking through the city holding a large flag and Excelsior banner, with teams from other ships as well. It was a fun parade, but with the heat and sunlight I was glad whe I could hand the flag to another crewmember and get a drink. I have just got back from a crew party over at the hangerm strange, it was much more comfortable outside, the heat and noise inside is not my preference, then again, the food was nice, but in the end I decided to return to the Excelsior to take advantage of the quiet here. I just can hardly wait until we actually get sailing on saturday!      I'll post a bit more some other time.
