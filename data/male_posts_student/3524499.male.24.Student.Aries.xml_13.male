Find out what it is!! d) a good way for report: present/explain the problem, and then approach it, solve it!  5) AKENTI It is very helpful in the policy specification/distribution, although not about VPN. Explore it more carefully!!    [To Do List] : 1) prepare the design proposal; 2) try to work out a clearer idea about the prototype;    [Supplement] : 1) Next meeting with Steve on Thursday(10th June) at 3pm; 2) He expect more technical detail!! good proposal!!
