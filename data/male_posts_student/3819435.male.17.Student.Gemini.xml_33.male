There's something exhilirating about leaving for a period of time, but there's something even better about coming back.  Honor Choir was super and I wish I could go back. The people you meet there are unlike any others. They are one in a million, I'll tell you what. I just hope we don't lose touch.  Wisconsin with Stephanie D. was awesome. I had the best time. Her mother and she surprised me and took me to a Twins game the first full day I was there. Those of you that know me well, know that I love baseball, so that was quite a treat. So was the bat/water boy...mmm...tasty. =)Yes, well, we did all sorts of fun things to make for an absolutely great time all around.  I did some clothes shopping for school and was quite happy to make my purchases. It's always fun, is it not?  Let's see, I guess we are supposed to discuss things and pose questions of interest on this bloggie-o, so hmm...*ponders* What classes are you all looking foward to as we begin this senior year (well, those of us here that are seniors)? I hope you aren't dreading it, because as soon as this year begins, it'll be over. Perhaps that is worth dreading. It all being over. But no. It'll be great. Just you wait.  **Louisa**
