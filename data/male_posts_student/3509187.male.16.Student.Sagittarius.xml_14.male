Have you ever noticed how when you get only a little sleep, you feel a bit more energized that lots of sleep but only in shoty bursts, but you have a lot less self control...  well then tonight... Untitled Live and Uncut... at band practice. yep thats right more Untitled Practice. I miss yesterdays cause I wasn't home or something but oh well, Eric said they wrote an original and we'll do some more writing tonight...   So other than that what has happened since my last post??? Wellll... A whole lot of nothing.  More In-Car.  I still like the Focus best of all.  I drove the matrix today, and there isn't a wole lot of visibility out the back, but it has a cool interior set up. Its a lot like the Focus crossed with a van. Tomorrow will be the Focus or the Malibu.  Also, I handed in my cover letter and resume at Music Mart... Hoping to get the job, that would be such an awesome place to work. Tomorrow I have a Dentist appointment at 9:30, so after I will go around town dropping off application and resumes.  Maybe I will see Crazy Miss Pangborn again...  Where should I ear lunch tomorrow?  Well then... later there maybe more...  -Dan V
