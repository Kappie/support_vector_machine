Many in the western world thought that the mere removal of Saddam Hussain will make Iraq more prosperous or at least it will help Iraq to come on to the track of progress. That has not happened so. The main premise on which this war was fought has turned out to be a blatant lie there are no WMD'S in Iraq. This lie has not only affected the credibility of the coalition countries but has tarnished the image of CIA. For which George Tenet had to pay the price just a few days back by resigning. Car bombings and targeted killings of senior Iraqi government officials has become a thing of routine. American forces have compromised with radicals like Al-Sadr because the American generals on the battlefield are well aware of the harm an uprising in Najaf and adjoining areas would cause to the handover of sovereignty at the end of this month. The future looks gloomy but hope is still there at least, George Bush facing an election soon would like for the American people to think so.                               How the Iraqi story shapes up will not only determine the fate of the American president but will also dictate the future of the middle-east.
