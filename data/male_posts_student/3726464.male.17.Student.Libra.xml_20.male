I MISS HER A LOT.. it's crazy.. i am crazy.. i dun even know if she feels the same way.. i dun even know if she cares for me.. i dun know.. all i know.. is that.. the way she speaks to me, is like i'm irritating.. i.. haiz.. life.. so many things happening to me.. now, my heart is racing.. always like that... sit down, feel like vomitting... stand up, see black dots in front of my eyes.. it's time.. heaven is calling me soon.. well.. we all have to go sometime don't you all think so.. early or late.. as long as you live life to the fullest.. did i? i think i did..
