Reading it, it's hard to remember that so many of these kids are  so  young.  I admire the people that can choose to do that willingly.  It's a job that someone needs to fill, preferably not me (I don't think I'm built that way).  At the same time, I can't help but think that some of the more huah guys (career infantry) must feel like they're in an alien world when they leave or are discharged.  For instance, "Good dog -- defecating beyond the perimeter" is wicked funny, but kind of bothersome, too.  In any case, recommended reading certainly.  I also finished  Shrub  by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose.  I know I'm a little late on the curve there, but I wanted to read it for a while and just got a chance.  Interesting stuff in there about W's time in Texas.  Currently, I'm reading Jack Vance's  The Dying Earth  and  Bushwacked , the sequel to  Shrub .  Haven't read enough of either to really get an impression yet, but the latter seems like a surer bet.  Vance's novel, on the other hand, which was written in 1950, is pulp fantasy and dated, although it has its moments certainly.  I'm just not sure about it quite yet.
