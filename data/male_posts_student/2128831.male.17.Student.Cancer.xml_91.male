Is suicide a behavior unique to the human species?   I ask because the other day I was making coffee and noticed ants marching around the sink.  There weren't a lot, three or four at most, and they seemed to be absent a particular purpose or destination - and then I noticed one ant that was ass up (or ass down - who can tell?) on the counter next to the dish rack.  Really.  It was kinda freaky to see him like that. I began to imagine what led up to that.  Maybe he was creeping along the window ledge, intensely engaged in the perpetual hunt for food (of which there was none) when, suddenly, faced with the prospect of going home with an empty mandible, he gave up hope and took a header, bonking on the counter.  Not that I'm an advocate of ants - or anything with six or more legs.  But it does makes you wonder, no?   Okay, I've held my tongue long enough.   Someone needs to explain for me a sound and logical argument supporting same-sex marriage, preferably someone who is unswayed by political affiliation or gender orientation.  Thus far, not one of my queer friends has deviated from the assertion that attaining the right to marry their same-sex partner is tantamount to achieving equality with the greater (heterosexual) population.  However, it does prove that my friends may as well be sheep.   Advocates of same-sex marriage say that married people have the benefit of certain rights.  For instance, married people have the right to survivors' benefits, the right to visit their spouse in a hospital (whatever type that might be included), the right to adopt children, the right to inherit, and the right to make medical decisions.  But wait!  Where on the marriage certificate are such rights enumerated?  Oh, I see ... the rights we speak of were born of policies created by institutions seeking to draw distinctions between those who are married and those who aren't.  In other words, policies of societal control.  For those of you who don't remember (or weren't listening) in their Sociology classes, how about a refresher?  These United States were founded by a landed gentry that employed marriage as a means of obtaining property, and restricted the institution of marriage to members of their own class (the laws of the time also classified women as property).  In fact, women were unable to hold property or cash assets in their own name, were expected to give up their maiden name upon marriage, and still don't earn the standard of wages that men do.   There is no historical proof that the institution of marriage was created to permit an equalization of any sort -- not among the marriage partners, and certainly not between the sexes.  Which raises a critical question:  So long as inequality remains among the greater heterosexual population, where in the larger picture does the argument of achieving equality for gays and lesbians fit?   The "rights" sought by proponents of same-sex marriage -- inheritance, property, adoption, etc. -- weren't created when marriage was.  It seems to me that the better fight would be changing the policies that were created as afterthoughts to marriage, rather than blindly (and sheepishly) endorsing a patently non-egalitarian social control measure.   SCOOTERS!   Gorgeous weather today ... think I'll take my scooter for a ride. If you've never ridden a scooter, it's an experience I recommend highly; a buddy took me for a ride on hers last summer, and I've been hooked since. Unfortunately, there still aren't many riders in this area, even though we have 300 days of sun on average per year. But my buddy still managed to put together a small group that regularly gets together in the summer to ride in a gaggle - and we must be a sight to see! The best part of owning a scooter? Parking wherever I want to, rolling right up the sidewalk to the establishment's front door. And a fill-up only costs $1.75....
