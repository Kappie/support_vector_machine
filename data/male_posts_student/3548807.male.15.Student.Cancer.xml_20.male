Today around 12:00pm i was walking into my basement thinking about my special someone, when all of a sudden i spaced out, tripped down the stairs, tumbled to the bottom landed on my arm, but did nothing. I sat there motionless, my mind still hooked on her. my arm is a bit bruised but it'll be fine. so just a warning to you love birds out there...do not walk down stairs, use a motor vehicle or operate heavy machinery under the influence of love. *sigh* but now as i have just recently been informed...i cannot get together with this person over the next weekend. my brother is visiting from belleville. and don't get me wrong i really want to see him. but damn why do i have to be in love on the weekend that he comes down? so that's one less weekend that i get to see the woman of my dreams before i leave for an entire friggin month. this whole thing now has made me not want to go now. maybe i'll escape in the middle of the night and hithchike all the way to guelph then show up on her door. i wish i could...but i've devised an easier plan that doesn't involve me giving head to truck drivers for a ride (eww). i've figured that i could get a letter for each day that i'm away and write to her every day. and for the days that i'm in the wilderness i keep writing them and send them out all at once. that is my new goal for this summer. that and to be able to say what i want to her.
