I have had a maximum of five hours sleep every night for the last week, and have spent a maximum of twenty minutes in my house apart from in my bed, and the train has become my new best friend!  But hey ho, work hard and get the rewards hey!  I am gonna go and have a nice cold pint down the pub, go for a curry with the boys and then potentially collapse and try and watch the Tyson fight, but somehow I don't think that is gonna happen!  Will try and leave a longer note this weekend, maybe provide some explanation as to why I am working these crazy hours - an insight into the world of an investment banker perhaps.........  For now, good night,  A
