I am seriously considering switching to another blog hosting site, but Blogger is the best free one I can find.  It's just so flaky.  I could upgrade to the paid version of Blogger, but that costs money (obviously).  The only thing I can see working out is upgrading the the paid version, and then placing just enough paid ads to pay for my blog.   What do you guys think?  Do you know anything about placing ads on your site, and if so, would it be a good idea for me to switch?
