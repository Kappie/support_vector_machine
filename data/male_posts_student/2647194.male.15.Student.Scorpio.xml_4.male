Oh what fun. Just to let people know, the Lego Robotics State Competition, which is where I will be spending my time and becoming exhausted all day, is located at Benildi Saint Margaret's private school in St. Louis Park. It runs from 8 in the morning to about 5 in the afternoon. I will have the wonderful opportunity of getting over there by 7:30.  If any of you want to come, just show up. My team's name is Mars or Bust, and we're expecting to go to Nationals (LOL). Not really, but hey.  Dang, I wish I didn't have to get up so early. But I do, so I'm outta here since I'm tired and, of course, everyone knows that sleep is the solution to that. *Studies show that people who get 8 hours of sleep are more creative in the morning than those who don't.*  L8er all, Bren
