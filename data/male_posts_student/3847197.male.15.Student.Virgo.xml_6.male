My mother and I went to the lake with her boyfriend.  The first night there, which was Friday, was pretty lame.  We got in late and had to work work work.  We crashed at about 2AM or so.  Next moring at about 10 we got up and ate, then spent about all day on the boat, swimming, and chillin'.  That was pretty fun.  Went skiing, tubin', and all that fun stuff.  We then came home and had a classic smoores feast before playing Phase 10 for about 2 hours.  Very relaxing.  The next day was July 4th.  We did the Boat thing again and went and got some ice cream.  After the day died down we watched soem fireworks and went back to camp for some R$R (Rest and Relaxation).  Then Monday was spent packing and driving.  Not a long haul from Lake Gaston.  It's just about a 1 and 1/2 hour drive, or there abouts.  Got in here at about 1PM, unpacked.  Then I've just been chillin' since then.  Hopefully I'll get unlazy and post more about my past and the events that've made up who I am.  That is all.
