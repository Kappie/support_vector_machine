I give it an 82 out of 100 on another fairly random scale that means very little to anyone who doesn't live inside my head.  It was entertaining and mostly amusing; the negatives were that the plot was wholly unbelievable and required the viewer to suspend all logic of how schools operate and how people really behave; and also that all of the characters besides Jack Black's (and even his, to a degree) were one-dimensional stereotypes.  It could have been much much worse; Jack Black did a nice job, they cast the kids well, the actors in the one-dimensional roles did as much as they could... but I think it also could have been considerably better had they reined in the situations that required the most leaps of faith and kept things feeling a little more real... then it possibly could have had a point, or some broader meaning, instead of just being a relatively entertaining 108 minutes without much depth.  I don't particularly like Jack Black or think he's all that special, and still liked the movie -- so that's a good thing I guess.  The concept's strong -- this movie written by Albert Brooks could have been a real gem; as it is, like I said, it's not bad, and it is often laugh-worthy... but it wasn't all that it could have been.  Just my opinion.  Reviewers seem to be loving this, so what do I know.
