Some including a racist, a fascist, a nazi, a fake, and that's just in one post. I don't care what people call me so those things don't bother me. I'll defend myself though. Racist, no I'm not racist. Do I have many friends that arn't white? Nope. But there arn't that many people of other ethnic backgrounds in our town. That's just the way it goes. And yes, I did tell Tejas to go back to India. Was it out of racism? No. I would tell a white British person to go back to England if they are just over here to steal from our countries wealth or brag about what they are getting from our country, which I have heard from Tejas. And plus, I never labled Tejas as an Indian. He did, that's his main saying, "I'm Indian." He was born in Winsconsin. So that makes him just as American as me yes. But he said he was Indian, so I told him to go back to India. Makes sence doesn't it? Do I believe in fascism? Nope not on a government standpoint. Can I be a fascist about this website and say who can come here and who can talk here. Heck yes. This is my website. I can dictate it however I want. Am I making you come to this website like a Nazi could? Nope, actually you never have to come to this website. And like I said, if you don't like it here, leave. You don't have to stay. I'm not forcing you like a Nazi would. I actually asked CJ to leave. Did he? Nope. Because he believes it's fun to make fun of me, which is very immature. But I guess its his right. But I never started any of this. I would of never commented on any of you people if you guys never would of came here first. I never stated anything offensive to any of you until CJ decided to come and leave a comment like "or just die." And then all these other people started leaving them. So what did I do? I left one too on my own site. Do you have a problem with that? I never bug you guys. I never IM you. You guys IM me, decide to put stuff on my site, I don't do that to you. So get over yourselves. I never bugged you. You just judged me. Nick you have no clue who I am. I don't know you. So I don't know why you are commeting at all. Isn't that just a little judgemental? Which you are accusing me of being? As I said to CJ last night, I don't talk about any of you guys, do anything to you guys, or hurt any of you guys. CJ just told me I was ignorant and everything I did was wrong. That could be true! But just ignore me then. I don't go around saying any of you guys are wrong. You guys come to me because you think its fun. If you guys come and do that to me, I'm gonna respond. It's ovious. And don't threaten my friends or me. Because that's the most immature thing I have ever seen. Like I said, if you don't like me, great. Just leave me and my friends alone. It's simple and smart right? Wow, I guess you learn something new every day. Well like I said, I can't believe this even got this far. I'm sorry if I affended anyone. But like I said, if you don't like what you see here. Use the little X at the top right of the screen. And then everything will be alright for you! And as for you people who say this is retarded for me to post my life here. Awesome! I hope it is! Because, man those other millions of people out there who use these blog sites must be retarded to! Well now that this is all over with, I'm gonna go get some food.
