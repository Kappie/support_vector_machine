Being around you puts me into paradise for a short while. I can't think when I'm not near you.  That aside, I've found the scariest person on the planet - the girl who whispers on the BT advert. "Wilson through ball to Carragher. Penalty to Carragher. Wilson top right, goalkeeper go left. Die, parents, bleed to death. Eat your appendix, rabbit. Plant a small explosive device in your colon, brother."  Love, Jon Roskilly
