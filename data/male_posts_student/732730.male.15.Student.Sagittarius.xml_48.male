Half way through the run of sad songs, I was gonna tell Tanya how I used to have a crush on Jessica. Why am I thinking of Jessica, you ask? WELL. I was looking over my photos and found this:  urlLink http://adam.l2p.net/lightbox/index.php?p=97 . And woah. I'm starting to wish I did have someone like that. As Ryan from Big Brother would say, she's a great chick.  But now I'm thinking about Ella. We got  really  close in German. I was thinking "wow... I'd  love  her to be mine". BUT SHIT WOAH MAN! I bet you're thinking, woah man, you're gay! But thats bizarre, because I'm starting to question that myself. Just the way I feel sometimes. Like towards Ella and Jess and Ellie. And others. Liek woah.  And Kieran is calling me. I don't wanna talk to him. I'm getting really sick of his shit!  Arrgh!
