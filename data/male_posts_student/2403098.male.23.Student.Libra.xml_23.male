Blanket Jackson.  That's bound to screw this child up more than just having Michael Jackson as a father will anyway.  Of course, I picture "Blanket" as completely animated.  Naturally he's a blanket with arms and legs, you fill in the blanks.  Speaking of Blankets, ever thought about what a sperm with a lazy eye, wearing a ski hat would look like?  I have!  Only because lauren put that in my mind last night on the phone.  We decided last night that STD sperm look different than regular sperm.  Maybe they swim sideways, kinda.  They probably are all wearing backpacks, but the STD one has got a ski hat on, and a lazy eye.  If that visual doesn't make you wear a rubber, I don't know what will.  Speaking of wearing a rubber, I think that's how the whole STD sperm conversation came from.  We were discussing being seniors '99, and that damn "Wear Sunscreen" song that was kind of scary.  Good, but scary.  His MAIN advice was at the end, above everything in life, was "wear sunscreen."  REALLY?  (me to lauren): "wouldn't better advice be.. 'wear a rubber.'  It's true, think about it, sunburn, or a baby?  Which would you rather have?  At least a sunburn only lasts a few days.  Babies, on the other hand, last until the adoption papers get finalized.  I'll take a sunburn, THANK you.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of 2004?  WEAR A RUBBER.
