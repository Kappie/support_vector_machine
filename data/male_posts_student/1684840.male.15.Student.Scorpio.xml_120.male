I've been really weird lately and hopefully I'm not in a depressive and nasty mood anymore.  Me, Sam, Craig, James, Chris, and Kayla are going to watch "The Day After Tomorrow" at Apollo this afternoon.  Should be fun :o)  The forum is up, join NOW!  It's meant for myself and my friends or people at school but if there are any adults reading, feel free to see what us teens talk about lol.  I'll post later after the movie... ta ra
