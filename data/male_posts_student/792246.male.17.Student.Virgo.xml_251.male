Paly people actually have school next week, and they tend to not be very free on Sundays.  I have a slight headache, and my room is a mess. (Note to self: Probably related) I think I will clean my room today and build my new filing cabinet Anton.  But before that, I need to get up. I'm having one of those mornings where everything after waking up seems completely unnecessary. Yes, I'm blogging in bed.
