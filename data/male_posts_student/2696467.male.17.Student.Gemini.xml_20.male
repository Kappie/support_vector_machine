So far this is what is done:  "If I was a Thug" --Written "If you only knew" --Written  I am going to try to record those soon, and work on writing more. I plan to write anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, it all depends on how creative I'm feeling. Then hopefully I will have it all recorded by atleast late May to mid-June. Then hopefully I will mix it all and have it by June, if all goes good. I want to get a verse or so from my cousin, and a few from a friend of mine.  So hopefully I will have that all done, and by this Summer have a few if not all the tracks up on my soundclick page.   so be lookin out for updates on my progress on here.  At the moment I am working on gathering more beats, and I'll probably write a few more verse later tonight, but I'm feelin really tired. Hopefully I can go to my cousin's house tomorrow and talk with him about recording something for my CD.   Anyway I can't think of anything else to say. Once again I would like to know if anyone out there is reading this, Throw me an E-mail: NLsouljah2005@aol.com.       Later,     -HAZE-
