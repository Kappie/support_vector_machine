My dearest friend Jill, her family, and her brother-n-law's family were visiting for the day, and given that I haven't seen her or her family in a year's time (they live in Rochester, NY), and given that I have never been to one of the "magic kingdoms", I decided to join them for the day.    I'm back home from spending about5 1/2 hours there.    I'm  urlLink numb .    Temperatures were at least 80 degrees under a boiling, bright southern-CA summer sun;hundreds of adults with even morechildren running around under foot;waiting in long, circuitous lines that tookfour times as long to wade through thanthe actual ride took to entertain the guests; happy, shiny "helpers"periodically checkingto make sure that "everything's OK"; faux hillbilly bandsplaying Disney-related musicwhile sitting in a faux salooneating cheeseburgers; some of the adults actingmore childish than the kids. For the love of God, what werewe thinking?    No wonder there are European countries that have resisted or rebuked the invasion of the Mouse on their valiant shores!    Actually, despite and including all of the aboveIhad a   very   nice  fun time (yes, I know,  urlLink Teresa , you were right again).It was great tovisit withJill and her family and friends. And the kids were real troopers despite the heat, the lines, and the little disappointments that can easily mare a day liketoday.    Favorite ride of the day:  urlLink Indiana Jones Adventure .Plus, I was entirely impressed withthe staffgettinghundreds of carsefficiently parked in neat little rows. I parked in  urlLink Goofy , section H, row 7.    Andall for a mere for $49.75! Trauma has never been so cheap!
