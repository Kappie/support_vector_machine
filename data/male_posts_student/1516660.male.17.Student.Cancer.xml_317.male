I ate my breakfast and Dad took me there. Woah..I hate driving behind buses. They are so freaking slow! The cars on the other lanes are zomming by us. So meowful! I reached CCK station just nice. Okay. Maybe 1-2 minutes late. Oh well.  Hmm. A large group of Riversidians were there. Hmmm. Soon, we set off towards PJ lor. Hmm. When reaching school, PY came to tell us our group. Ayiah! Her information is WRONG! I went into OG18, not 21. Heh Heh.  Ahh well. My OGLs are Steve and Joy, both graduated cats. Anyhoo, there are a lot of girls in my OG, quite a few guys wor. Hmm. Ayioh. Today was kinda boring. There are much more options on me form, so that's good. That principal, Mr Quek, is terribly funny. Actually, funny as in lame. He was saying that there are more girls than boys in PJ, so not every girl will get a boyfriend. -.-" Anyway, this is just like the first day of the Orientation 1. Utterly boring.  Hmm. At 11, we were releashed. I went with my OG, then met up with CQ and gang at the uniform stall. Yeah. I brought 2 sets of shirt+pants, plus a mandatory tie. It costs $77 total. Woah...I only brought $80, just nice wor. Heh Heh. I tried to escape from my OG, but decided not to. Hmmm. The clan got together to ice-break (quite unsuccessfully. Hmmm. My group is quite nice... heh heh. Yes. Good good.   Hmm. The guys left for Lot 1 first, so I went there alone. I met them at Mac, then I ate my lunch lor. Hmmm. Yes. When we were about to take the MRT, we saw CK and gang. Hmm. They suggested going to Causeway Point's 6-floor to chat. O.O  Ayioh! CQ now wants to go Chem/Phy! Oh my lord! So many cats want to go Chem/Phy now! Yes! After giving it serious thoughts, I decided on choosing Phy/Chem too. Hmm. Well, I am thinking of majoring in Psychology, and that doens't need any requirements. I need to get a good pass to enter university. Well, they said Phy was easier to score than Bio. Meow moo. So meow moo!!   Hmm. We stayed there for awhile, then while we went down, we met SL and WT. O.O! HaHa. We all accompanied her to eat BK. Yes! We chatted more! Hmmmmm. After that, they went to walk around Causeway. Hmm. My parents came to fetch moi back, so I left early.  Coming home, I bathed, came online, then went to eat dinner. Ayioh!!!
