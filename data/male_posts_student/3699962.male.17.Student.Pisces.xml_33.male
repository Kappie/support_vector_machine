It was then I realised why God made the church. Why he wanted the church to be a community. Cause it was in the conversation with Sarah and Jessie, that I took a step back and looked at it, and smiled. I'm so thankful for these two peeps. It's not that I became all well again, but I was thankful that I knew I could fall back and these two people, heck, my whole small group would be there for me. I'm not all better and everything - not that they didn't help, they did. But I was happy and I was sure God was smiling too. As Rhordan would say 'Bullseye'.  Sherman
