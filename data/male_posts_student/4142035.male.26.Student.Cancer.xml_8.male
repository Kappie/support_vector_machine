I used to have a cast-iron immune system and now it takes a solid week or two to completely rid myself of an ailment.  I'm at home right now instead of working because a cold/flue that I "got over" about a week ago has come back and now I'm vomiting phlegm in my sleep.  I'm not scared of germs.  Folks these days are way too easily spooked by the latest virus that the news has decided to report on more than once for no real reason.  Bird flu is something to avoid, but not something to freak out about.  But taking three weeks to kick a cold is, well, stupid.
