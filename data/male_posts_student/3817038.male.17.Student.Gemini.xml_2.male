Then they woke me up this morning at 9:00 cause they wanted to go to Bruegger's Bagels for some breakfast... *sigh* i need a good sleep ;)  Mike called me this morning which is cool cause i haven't talked to him in a long time.... we'll probably get some friends together and find something fun to do.  he's really good at finding fun stuff to do... it'll be good to see all my old school friends again, no matter how weird alot of them are.  Last night, when i was talking to Serra, she asked me a question which, naturally, didnt' go through on crappy MSN :P.  Then when i asked her to reask the question... she refused.  What's the dealioyo?  No worries though, i'm stubborn... i'll find out eventually.  Besides, it's nothing a little *kiss* couldnt' remedy.... guess i got a taste of my own medicine.  ok, i'm off to take these girls to lunch now, i'll have another post later.
