THEN I CANNOT STUDY, MY BOOKS INSIDE, IF THAT LESSON I HAVE NO BOOK THE TEACHER ASK ME I SAY RONALD LIU TAKE MY BAG BLAME HIM, DON'T BLAME ME. try and act big huh, i tell you i can be very nice to a person, but if you incur my wrath, you will suffer. well i for i don't know how Mr.Tan Wi Shen and Mr. Jeremy Wong got to know about it, my life is so dam stressful. today the chemistry presentation was screwed due to something called miscommunication, i don't want to elaborate about it!!!! well tommorrow i have NCC training, lucky i bought the medical supplies to replenisht the medic kit, but tommorrow confirm kena suan by some bastards who try act big with thier new rank!!! oh god how did i get to this!!!! oh well happy birthday to me, ok gonna sleep now, dam tired!!! bye!!!
