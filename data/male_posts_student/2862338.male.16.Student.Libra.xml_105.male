These's feelings came about pretty recently.  I've always liked this person, and we've always been freinds, but i don't know, this whole thing is just driving me nuts.  He's my one, my only, my everything.   And now that he's gone for vacation, i'm lost, i'm desperatly lost. I need is pale, white, pasty skin, i need those glasses, those hats, i need those witty remarks, and large collection of video games, i need that skinny white welsh ass....i need my jonesy back..  I need him like a fay man needs cake.  I long for him.  The last week without him was absolutly devastating for me, and now, to come back, to nothing?! surely it's a joke.  But all i can say is that i love hime, and i need him here...jonesy-poo, if your reading this..come home...i need you...
