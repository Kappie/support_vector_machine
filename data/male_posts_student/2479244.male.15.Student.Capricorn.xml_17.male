The people that are reading this will try to understand, and I hope I can help clear things up. It is about the hostility and aggression I have been receiving upon my consideration of leaving the IB program.  To whom it may concern, do not take this as a personal attack. I intend for you to read this as a neutral-opinion individual reading to understand. You took too quickly to your opinion for a judgment from myself, the person who is involved. I would appreciate it if you read this.  I was recently confronted about my possible decision of leaving what could be many years of pointless agony for what it is I am shooting for. I do not intend to possess the ideals of the program -- the Astrophysicist who is also the Nationally Renowned Lawyer, also known for being the World's Foremost Expert on Multilateral Ionic Compounds and the like -- I'm just a simple guy looking to do what it is that I like.   I don't care if I live in poverty because of it, I don't care if you or the program don't accept me for what I believe, I don't care if everyone I know forgets me because I simply made a choice instead of doing what I was told. This is the crossroads of my future. I can go one way (the route of the IB program,) one littered with bumps, rocks, potholes, and other various debris in order to get good suspension and better steering (when in fact I'm aiming for better acceleration,) or I can go down the other way (a different school,) one that looks to be pretty straight, a bit foggy, a few curves, so at the end I can go where I want and smile because the ride was easy on my car.  If you were dearly confused by my comparison, look at it this way -- I'm not out to become a "general-expert" on a couple topics, a majority of which will come in no use to me, but I would rather like to be a full fledged professional with boundless knowledge of one subject. Don't get me wrong, some people really like the program because it keeps their options open. They can do what they want and they can say that they have the past to prove it.  However, the one reason I know I won't go over well with the program is because I don't have (and honestly I sincerely hate) the same intelligence stimulation concepts as the people in the program. That is to say, I prefer not to bombard my mind with countless topics for a big exam that is supposed to sum up how well I know everything. It is my opinion that a test does not prove how well you know something, just how well you can regurgitate the words that were thrown at you. The IB program has thus far taught me little to nothing new, just the same thing other people are being taught with a lot more worksheets.  If getting a regular education with a lot of "write-it-downs" helps you learn, then good for you. But understand that I do not learn that way. It will not make me more intelligent to simply repeat something over and over until its so hammered into my mind that I will recite it in my sleep when I am thirty. I learn better by making my own decisions and own observations with what I have learned, not by basing my personal knowledge off of what some institution tries to convince me of. The Program has its beliefs on what knowledge is, and I have my own.    I know, as before, you are convinced I am doing this because of the "less work" part. As much as it might seem, that is not the case. I can entirely handle the work load from such a place. The fact of the matter is this: I have a decision to get an education with work, or I have a decision to get an education with just less work. Why, in the end, should I go with the first instead of the latter? Why get the same potential education with simply more work, when you could have done it easier? Why, at all, be forced to be educated in a topic that will not come into use?   Of course, there is always the "what ifs."  What if you really need to know it? What if it does come into use? What if you're in a bad situation and you need that knowledge to get out?  Well, what if none of that matters? What if I never use that knowledge? The point being, I just don't care. You can give me all the shit you want for not muscling through this, and you can laugh at me when I'm dying because I forgot to recite the atomic weight of lanthanum, but I don't really mind. I don't want the Program to hold  it  for me while I piss. I prefer to hold it on my own, even if it means I might be peeing the wrong way.  Now, if you decide to tell me I'm making a mistake because it is too unclear and there are too many risks, let me have you know that I am aware of the possibilities. My brother went to a public school, he is graduating this year, and has received college applications from many prestigious colleges - NYU, Massachusetts, Maine, etc. The fact of the matter is that he is not any less important or worse at anything than any IB student. He simply isn't versed in a matter that was formulated for the sole purpose of the IB program. He is far more of an intellectual than most people I have ever met in IB -- he is the top of his class in Calculus, in Spanish 4, in AP Chemistry, got a very high score on his SATs -- but the thing that matters is not that he is good at remembering 150 Spanish Vocabulary words after a single night of studying, but rather that he still retains common sense, dignity and humility along with his education.   It is all too common among higher classman in IB that I see them holding up their chins, stepping on peoples toes, insulting people, simply because they can say "I did it and you didn't, so make way, simpleton." The IB program, to me, is nothing more than a badge, a say-so, a trophy of putting yourself through misery just for a self projected moment of glory. Why should I whip my own back so I can grin later when I can grin now, smile later, and keep on smiling? Its senseless to do the things to yourself that the IB program will make you do when you have plenty of it coming in the future. It is not human nature to repeat something until it becomes habitual. That is degrading yourself to the state of society's poster child. I myself will find another way to what I like, thank you very much.  The one thing I want people to get out of this essay-like expression, if anyone reads this, is that surrounding yourself with money, the reassurance of a "good education," and the ideals of modern society will not get you happiness. Do what you like. If you like being guided by a program, then go right ahead. I myself will take the road of choices. Its important to make your own mistakes. How will you ever grow if you can't learn from them, and how do you learn from them if someone is always there to catch you? Common sense comes from real-life mistakes and problems. The IB program attempts to keep you from any sort of failure on their standards. The IB program is the net below you. The IB program -- well -- just isn't for me.  Like they say, "Never let schooling get in the way of your education."
