Till nou when a penalty shoot is taken, the defenders used to run from the Goal-Post towards the Shooter and block the shot. but now it cannot be done, and the goal post will be virtually empty. though it gives oppurtunity, i read in an article that it would put India in a disadvantage. I didnt understand his logic. still iam unable to understand.
