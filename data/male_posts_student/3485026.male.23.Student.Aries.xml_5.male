Part of me is starting not to care about it...all you hear about is how hard it is and how time consuming it becomes.  But with my grades being a bit lower than I would like, I feel like I have to at least try and make it, even though in the back of my head I am pretty sure that there is no way in hell that I am going to make Law Review.  Considering that I am going to spend two days on it, and I will need to either pull an all nighter tonight, tomorrow night, or Thursday night, and I am pretty tired right now, so tonight is probably not going to happen.  This most likely means that I will have to stay up for both tomorrow and Thursday night, which will make my trip to Indy on Friday morning interesting...but at least all I have to do when I get back is crash and sleep for a day and half before helping Justin load some stuff and head over to Fort Wayne to see Jackie.  Anyway, I guess that is about it for now, I think I will head to bed early tonight to try and get some good sleep so I can be as productive as possible tomorrow working on the case comment...hopefully I can at least get six pages of it done, which would be half of the maximum were are allowed.  Oh well, enough for now, off to bed...zzzzzzzzzzzz
