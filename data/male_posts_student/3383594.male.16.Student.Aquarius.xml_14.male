The gd thing was tt during her lesson, there was like total silence. Nobody was talking at all. Not even the lil' pig or the fat pussy cat. L0L! Sucha peaceful environment tt I can concentrate in. Hehe, hope tt it will remain like tt till the 'o' lvls. Tt will definitely be pretty cool. Garyson sat behind me and I turned around sometimes juz to talk when I'm realli bored. Fat pussy cat was juz beside me and was being irritating as usual. I was like whispering to Garyson and nobody could hear wad we were talking at all, but he juz had to ask me to keep quiet and pay attention. In the first place, he's the one not paying attention. Wad a moron! L0L!  After E Maths, the gay fat pussy cat was doing stupid stuffs as usual. He was using his weak arm to strangle me and bring me to the ground. *Yawnz* Well, at least tt wasn't on a sofa or a bed. The ground is so much more spacious compared to a sofa or a bed. On the ground I haf more space to move. On the sofa or the bed, I'll probably be nailed down by his fat body! L0L! But he's still a short, ugly, disgusting, weak, gay, fat pussy cat! L0L! 6 simple vocab words juz to describe him! L0L! Wait, maybe I missed some other words. L0L! Nah, I can't be bothered to go on describing a fat pussy cat. Peace lil bro! L0L!  The rest of the day was plain boring. Haha, I need something special to keep myself entertained. Nowadays, it seems like I get bored easily and it takes alot to make my lively and kicking again. L0L! Well, I think I won't be able to get tt entertainment frm school, probably not. Unless there's like something or someone tt can keep me realli entertained.  After school, I saw Anwar. We went for lunch than played pool for about one and a half hrs. Man, I realli gotta save cash for the rest of the wk if I intend to go out on Sat wif Hongyue. We'll probably catch a movie first or smt cuz the 'o' lvls listening ends at like 10:30am and the stuff tt she wanna see is in the late afternoon, around 2pm. Yup, so we might juz go walk around or smt. Hmmm, but nothing's confirm till tt veri day. L0L! I'm always like a last min person nowadays, confirming things at the veri last min onli. Well, let's juz hope tt the movie won't be a chinese 1 juz like The Best Bet. -.=" *sighz*. Oh! Apparently there were unhappy ppl after they found out I went to watch The Best Bet wif some other of my frens when I told them I would nvr watch tt sh!tz film. L0L! I'm like so dead now, haha, but who cares anyway. It wasn't my fault! L0L!  I suddenly haf a phobia of bearhugs. Haha, dunnoe why, but juz feel odd bout' it. Alrite, I'll stop crapping here and try to get the phobia away soon. L0L! Cya yall~ =]
