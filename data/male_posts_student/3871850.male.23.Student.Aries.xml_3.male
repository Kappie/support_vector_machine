Aiya that time I was almost late for school so I never go over and see loh.. Miss a winning chance.. LOLz.. Then when I was on the bus towards my way home.. I saw one of my classmates whu also live around my area alighting from the opposite bus stop.. Hmm.. it was kinda strange loh.. becuz why got Mrt dun take leh.. If my prediction was correct.. she take Bus74 to Yio Chu Kang then take Bus72 fromYio Chu Kang.. Anyway everyone got their own preferences.. LOLx..    In The End.. Its Only The Fittest Survive In This World.. If You Are Strong You Live.. If You Are Weak You Die.. That's The Truth!!    *MerQu|s3*^^ aka *yeKai*^^
