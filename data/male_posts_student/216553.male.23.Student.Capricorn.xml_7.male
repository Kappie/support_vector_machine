We have exams next week, but to each his/her own I guess.  They're gonna have fun ;)  The Anatomy quiz went fine today.  I made a retarted mistake...rather, I second guessed myself for no reason.  For one of the questions in the matching portion, I selected 3-5 layers for the stratum spinosum, when it is in fact 8-10 layers, which I put for the stratum granulosum.  Why? I dunno, just being stupid I guess.  I got everything else right though (I hope!) :)  We also had a really interesting guest lecture today by Dr. L. about MI's (myocardial infarctions), aka: heart attacks, and went over most of the angioplasty procedure, aka: how you go in with a catheter, technically called a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to remove an occlusion of an artery in the heart.  Honestly, this stuff is off the hook!!  He showed us some videos of  him  going in and removing an occlusion out of a 60 year old patient.  He also went over quite a bit of the pathogenesis, and complications that can arise.  Now, here's some symptoms that occur wihen a MI is occuring in a patient: perocardial pain, epigastric pain that may extend into the jaw or arms, pallor, diaphoresis, nausea and dyspnea.  There may also be a burning sensation.  Cool eh?  Hrm, other than that, things are ok.  I feel weird sometimes, because I didn't think that I'd miss my friends (namely JL) as much as I do...only 70 days left :(  Bye for now.
