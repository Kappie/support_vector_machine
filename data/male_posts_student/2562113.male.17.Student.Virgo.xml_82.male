I have not recorded any text in this box for many a day, so I shall sit at this computer of mine until the words being created in my brain are processed by my tounge, through my fingers and written for all to see. First, I would like to start by saying that it is wretched not being able to go to strip clubs for the simple reason that I was born a couple months too late, because I missed my opportunity to view a Ms. Brianna Banks. I also missed her sit on my comrade Reza's lap and give him a kiss. Secondly, I agree with Darin's assessment about the festivities, or lack there of, in the North Rockland area. It is just plain dispicable of us as Smut members to occupy the Smut house every weekend night. We must rise up against the powers that are supressing our teenage hormones and we must do what teenagers do, not what children do (ie. listen to our parents). We must start a revolution. Today, one may ask, "what is there to do in North Rockland" and the usual answer is, "Abso-fucking-lutely nothing". This must all change. The next time someone asks you, "what are you doing tonight?" it is necessary that the answer is "having fun at......'s house!"   We must start a revolution! Viva Los Bio Dome
