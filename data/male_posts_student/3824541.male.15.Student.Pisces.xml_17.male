It was 1 AM when I wrote it, and I'm not very happy with the final product.  ----- (Red Dress)  She stood there, looking over the pier. Her eyeliner was smudged with tears, and her foundation was bare where tears had rolled off her cheeks. She was in total fear. The fear in her face seemed to me generated by the man a few yards behind her. I presumed he was Dean. Although now that I think about it her face was unparalleled by Dean's face which was in both fear and confusion. I could only watch the heart-broken girl acting in nothing but senseless rage. "Valentina. Y-you cant swim." Dean finally let out. "Y-you'll s-sink." It seemed as though Dean was assuring himself of the situation instead of his ex-lover. His two sentences didn't change anyhting. She still stood there with a mild expression. Her brown eyes twinkled for a second, but she blinked, and she was once again indifferent to the situation. I remembered the scene that had happened only a few moments ago.  A blue Ford Tauros screeching to a halt in the grass. Valentina got out of the car in a black shirt that complimented her height, and ran onto the hot sand of the beach. She ran past Dean, and climbed to the top of the pier. Confused and startled Valentina had found him with another woman,  Dean tried to beat her to the pier. He had been a few yards behind her when she reached the edge. Fate, once again, let me watch someone dying ever so slowly. I blinked, and I continued watching the scene.  "I could never find anyone else. You kno-" Valentina was cut off.  Dean was running at full speed towards her. He grabbed the right side of her shirt and pulled. I wasn't standing close enough to hear the buttons snap, but the memory still sends shivers down my spine. Her shirt unbuttoned down the middle throwing Dean off balance, and one of his feet was off the pier, leaving him in an awkward position.  Valentina grabbed for Dean's hand, but was blinded by layers of eyeliner and mascara that tears, sweat, and humidity had removed. Her hand reached slightly to the left of where Dean's hand was in the split-second she had to save him. Dean plummetted to the bottom of the pier. Valentina's eyes shut, and she fell backwards onto rickety brown pier.
