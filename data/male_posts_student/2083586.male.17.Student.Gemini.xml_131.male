Hot Hot Heat  Guster (i didn't want to kick Miranda Sound off the list by taking hours and making a decision between the two) 3. The Red Light Sting (i only have one of their singles but i love it...a bit too much) 2. =W=eezer 1. Queens of the Stone Age...i dont fucking care what any of you say. They're great but i cant stand the songs "No One Knows" and "Go with the Flow" b/c you people ruined them!!!
