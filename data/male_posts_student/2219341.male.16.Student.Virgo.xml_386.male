((hence the word christian: Christ-like)).  he said that people should be look 2 places if they want to actually see Jesus Christ.  the bible and Christians.  that really just hit me.  like it was just a great point.  as Christians, people should be able to look to us to see how Jesus would be.  we should be walking Jesus's in our actions.  what really bothers me are all these people that call themselves Christian yet dont even attempt to be  Christ-like !  and then they come up with all these excuses like "oh well no body's perfect".  the bible doesnt say you have to be perfect.  God doesnt expect you to be perfect.  but come on!  at least put some effort into bein a Christian.  dont just say it and  DO  nothing.  oh and my favorite excuse!  "i'm not Jesus."  oh thats a good one.  if you dare call yourself a Christian ((remember  ONE WHO IS LIKE CHRIST !)) then dont you have to be  LIKE  Jesus!  goodness.  ok.  lol.  i'm done preachin it.  that kinda stuff just really bothers me.  not sayin i'm perfect or anything yanno.  but i do know that i try.     21  "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven  will  enter.   22  Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?'   23  And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness." -  Matthew 7:21-23
