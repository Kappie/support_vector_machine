Rei-chan and Jade-san visted our school yesterday. Jamie-san visited today. Fun. m-i-c-k-e-y-m-o-u-s-e. Mickey Mouse... Mickey Mouse, m-i-c-k-e-y-m-o-u-s-e.  I'm so tired... Today was the fourth Self Defence class. Tomorrow will be the last day, they'll be testing us then. I've been tired all week, and it may be because of the class...  I'm downloading X TV. I want to see the series...  so tired... gotta wash the dishes still... *sigh*  -ArV
