Mostly due to the fear......  Anyway I have other things on my mind. Not going down to London tonight as barbeque is being held in celebration of my birthday. Much to my annoyance!  Also the car, (oh god not again) is awaiting it's MOT. I suspect given my passion for unloved cars (I'll make a top 10 list at some point) this is going to become a major blog feature. Except I can be arsed to talk about it now.
