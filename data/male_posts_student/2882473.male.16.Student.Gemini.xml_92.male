Ok, I promise not to do too much fiddling with them.                 So, as you may have guessed, I have returned from that fun place called 'Dorset'. More specifically,'Poole' It's quite a nice town, but fairly dull. Nicht viel zu tun, ja? Sorry, I promised I would forget that dreadful language ASAP didn't I? So, what happenings did Dave get up to during his visit? Well, I had a game of putting with me dad, who won :( By 11 hits over 18 holes. Meh, I'll improve if I keep at it. And I had several games of chess (so about what I would be doing here in London then), but this time the old fashioned way, you know, where you actually  have  to play with someone else. Firstly, against my mum, who should have beat me, but managed a stale mate when trying to get 4 queens. Fool. Then with my oldest sister, whom I beat, which I felt very proud of, naturally. Slaughtered about 4 pieces with a queen right at the beginning of the game.    Ok, what else... what else... Well, we took a day trip to some town called 'Swanage', a rather nice town by the sea. Got some fish and chips for lunch, and walked round the shops. But then, horrow of horror! My sunglasses broke! :( So I threw them away. Although, this is not totally bad news; I can now buy a pair of Smith glasses, if I find a good pair for fairly cheap. If not, then just a normal pair would sufice.    Anyway, enough about the holiday, I am now back in good ol' London. Horrah! Yes, well, I went to see 'Spider-man 2' earlier today, which I must say is a truly excellent film. Although I think I liked the first one better. Or maybe just the loud people talking were annoying and ruined the film. Damn kids... I'll get 'em one day.... So, I reccomend it to all. Even if there weren't enough explosions.    And now I have about 6 weeks left untill I start the wonderful time of 6th form. With only 4 subjects, and tons more work, All that to look forward to. Well, could be worse, I could be doing something like drama, media film and english next year. Oh, wait... I believedickybod  is . Fool. Just    THROW    your life away... (knew that new fomatting thing would come in useful at some time. :)    Anywho, I need to arrange more outings for the dud-a-thon, as this will be a long summer.    Bye for now all.     Weather:  Cloudy, sunny   Reading:  Fellowship of the Ring   Listening to:  Brave Sir Robin   Watching:  Spider-man 2   Confused about:  Nowt really   Annoyed with:  Loud people in cinemas   Mood:  Good
