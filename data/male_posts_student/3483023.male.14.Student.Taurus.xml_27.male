So Far Today The Only Interesting Thing I Did Was Clean Silver's Cage! I Got $20 From My Grandma In The Mail Today, It Is For A Backpack/School Supplies, I Don't Know Why She Sent My Money, Its Not Like I Really Need It Or Want It! I Also Got My Schedule For My Wonderful Freshmen Year, Here Are The Classes I Will Be Taking: Algebra 1, World History, Spanish 1, Debate, Honors English, Journalism, Intergrated Science, Kansas History,  Microsoft Word- Doesn't Sound That Bad.... Does It? Well, I Need To Go Eat, But I'm To Lazy To Get Of My Booty And Get Something To Eat! Well, If Anything Intersting Happens I Might Post Agian Today, Until Then, C YA WORLD!
