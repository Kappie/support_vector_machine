O, if anybody hadn't noticed, I added a chatroom and two different counters to the page as well as a 'Bookmark Me' thing. There are also links to blogs that I like on the right side down a little ways so go look at them later on maybe? But on with my night from hell.  I'm not sure what is worse yet when working at JJ North Restraunt.. Time where you are being rushed to wash tons of dishes at once, time where there is -nothing- to do at all so you just -sit- and wait, and hope that a Manager doesn't come in even though there is nothing that you can do, or clean-up. Clean-up lasts until at least 11pm at night, which sucks for making much out of a night. Though it felt tempting to just drive around for an hour or so and see... umm... who was out... yea, that's it.. I didn't though, maybe next time cause I kept thinking about it from 11:30 [when I got home] until past 12 and thinking of places that I could go. O well I guess, always more chances and if not I can die virgin and nobody would give a care. For some reason that sounds... too correct too......  Women are tempting, evil, sneaky, sexy creatures. When they want something they will either come out hard with it or they'll try and hint at it, or if all else fails, they'll just flirt like hell until you give them -exactly- what they want. So yea, just a random though I guess. I have others, like parents can be a pain in the butt sometimes, you try and help them with something and they just turn it around on you. Like I had asked my mom about and hour or so ago if the laundry needed to run because there are whites just sitting in water [soaking I guess?] and she just ignores me about it, then my dad just got home from his first day at work and he is talking and I notice the laundry, -still- sitting there, and try and ask my mom between pauses cause my dad can talk for hours on end sometimes but that isn't always bad. So I try and get a word in and get barked at for 'interupting'. WELL SORRY FOR TRYING TO DO SOMETHING! Jeez! I mean, you always talk and I swear my family has tendencies to never listen to me anyways. Enough of that though.  My sister's mute cat just jumped up in my lap, makes a strange noise, my guess is when it opens its mouth and his teeth drag against eachother and his gums? He's a cute cat and all, friendly too. Won't be staying here though! Hehe.  I think it is time for me to stop writing/typing and play a game cause I'm rather bored and well... lonesome. So I guess I'll go play a game and write some more later or tomorrow. And before I forget, I have to work from 1-4 pm tomorrow.  ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~ ~~ Brian H.
