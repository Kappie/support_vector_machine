Who decided that suddenly my body would ahve a change and 10 hours of sleep wasn't gonna be enough for me?  I remember the good ol' days when I could EASILY get by on 7....damn childhood.  uh....don't really know what else to blog about, besides....  THAT DAMN PRINCESS!!(this one probably needs explaining) O.k. in the AWESOME game FFCC(Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles) there is a Princess who has gone missing, and it is an optional quest thing to go and find her.  The prize for finding her....100,000 gil.  Now that's a butt-load o' money.  I would like to have this money.  So, me being the greedy little guy that I am, go and try to find the Princess(with the help of an online strategy guide...well....actually...like 2 or 3 of 'em) AND NOTHING HAPPENED LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO!  So I didn't find the Princess before I went to bed, AND I was angry.  I did get Excalibur though...THAT was a plus.  Didn't find the damn Princess though....stupid Princess.  Now that I have wasted an entire entry on being brumpy at things....on a lighter note: Life is good, I enjoy it now.  I don't understand why I just let things slide earlier then this.  I could have been this happy a long time ago....Yes, I'm actually happy.  I'm not just yankin' anyones chain.  BE HAPPY! XD  Spense
