As I went into a local dairy queen today (actually it’s not very local, it’s about 15 driving minutes away), I saw on one of them little stand up signs advertising something called cake on a stick.  I figured why couldn’t they actually come up with a good name for it?  Like a 3D Dilly bar?  Or cake pop?  But nooooooooo they called it cake on a stick, the most unoriginal name ever.  So what do I do? I bought one naturally, what doesn’t taste better on a stick?  When I received this supposed “cake on a stick” I was gravely disappointed, not only was I about twice the price of a Dilly bar, but it was about half the size too.  This was an outrage; there was a seriously low ice cream to money ratio here.  Not only that but after a few minutes the ice cream melted enough that the whole cake on a stick fell off, I ate it anyway but it’s just not the same when it’s not on a stick.  But anyway, that was just one of my many adventures to come.  Stay tuned for “Living the Wal-mart life” but that’s only if I get the job. -Matt
