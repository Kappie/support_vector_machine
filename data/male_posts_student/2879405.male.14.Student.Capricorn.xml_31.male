Who told the Coach put 3rd choice pitcher to F*** Up the whole game, with all the sec 1s playing in the last inning, even worse right?? Somemore let in more than 12 runs in the very last inning, which you could blame no one but Hai Wei?? All the Ball no strikes caused it.(No Offence). HaHa the game lasted longer than Major League Baseball, especially in the last inning which lasted about 1/2 hour(1/2hr solely on the part where they batted )...I have no comments about that. Only that i have to hide my face.
