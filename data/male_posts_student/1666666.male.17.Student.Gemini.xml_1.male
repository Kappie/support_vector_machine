I hadn't planned on going up there and helping out but I didn't feel safe here alone with my stepdad after what he did (and it was his own fault, too).   For a long time now, my stepdad used his truck purely to get to work and back. Any time he, him and my mom, or anybody at all went anywhere, it was in my mom's car. When he referred to the car, he would call it "our car," as in "my car too." However, anytime he'd refer to the truck, he'd call it "my truck," as in " only  my truck." This is what he called them, and this is how they were used for years. (Truth be told, my mom's car was actually purchased for her by my real dad! I know he would have kept it for himself if he knew divorce lingered around the corner. Even so, my stepdad has the nerve to call it "our car." It amazes me.) My mom  finally  (as usual) got tired of the vehicles usage patterns, and took away the copy of the car key that he had, apparently without his knowledge. So one day, for reasons unknown, his truck (a '99 model Ford F-250 Super Duty) is parked  in  our  one-car  carport. It fits, sure; but barely. I'm not sure who was using the car that day, (a family at our church, and close friends of our family, was in a car accident, so my mom may have been letting them use it at the time, I don't really remember anymore) but the car was in the driveway behind the truck. If the truck is ever in the driveway, (which is rare) it's always behind the car, and precisely to prevent exactly what occurs on this day. There is ample room in the driveway outside of the car port, but for some reason, on this day, he wanted to make it fit inside the car port. He succeeded at this, only to realize (all too late)  what goes in must come out , and by this time, the car is parked behind the truck. As I mentioned before, his copy of the car key was apparently taken without him knowing. Because of this guy's laziness (his own fault), drunkenness (his own fault), and pure outright stupidity ("birth defect" is no excuse!), the car remained parked directly behind the truck in the driveway as he began his attempt at backing out of the car port while avoiding the side of the house, and 3 solid brick columns (2 on the left, 1 on the right) that support the car port hanging over the driveway, extending off of the house. Don't forget: the car is still behind him. I hear the sound of something falling and breaking as the house vibrates. I was in the living room, which is what's on the other side of the wall he was trying to avoid. I heard the truck crank up and I heard the breaking sound maybe 15 seconds afterwards, and I think to myself, "I couldn't get this lucky...!" I looked outside to find that I had gotten just that lucky. With   his   truck (and probably single-handedly), he had taken out the left column supporting the car port, along with probably something like five to ten thousand dollars in property value. My mom ran out from the bedroom franticly to see what had happened. Without thinking, I inadvertently allowed my amusement to enter my voice and said, "Dude! Larry just hit the house with his truck!" The door was open as my mom went outside to assess the damage, and I could hear him cursing and crying.  As I said before, I wasn't about to stay home alone with this guy, so I went with my mom to the church to help with Vacation Bible School. It actually turned out to be fun. Monday was slow, Tuesday I helped count pennies, which was more fun than it probably sounds. Wednesday through Friday, I helped my mom with the class she was teaching, which, if I remember correctly, was 5th through 6th grade girls. They were great kids; very well-mannered and obedient (for the most part). I really look forward to seeing (hopefully) most of them again next year.
