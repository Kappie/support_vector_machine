I think he is trying to force the image of white women on us. Nothin new. His ancestors have been doing it for a while now. Let him have his fun. The whole wide universe knows that African women are waaay more superior than white women. Strength, looks, lips, hips, tone of voice, warmth..... Please, I can go on and on.    White women??? Nah. Thats okay. I'll pass     This was in response to some troll coming in and posting naked pictures.  I didn't see them, but according to him these were pictures of white women.  Now, I'm not thinking the overly racially pumped philosophy behind this, but the deeper spiritual part of it reminded me of myself.  I think Sabrina and Rebecca were bothering me (all in good fun) after school, the halls were pretty empty, and this group of black people walked by and looked at me.  I tried to avoid their gaze, but I felt like the biggest sell-out ever with the look they gave me.  Ever since then, I've been hesistant to even be talking to any white girls at all in the halls because I feel like a million eyes are on me, and I guess they sort of are.   Damn.  I really shouldn't be posting something like that.
