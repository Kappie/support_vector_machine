They were both pretty fun but at universal there was nothing new and it was basically all shows. Disney is always fun fun fun but space mountain was closed off so that was pretty sad. Of course the lines were really really really long and we had to wait for a long time. It was fun though b/c we were there until 12 at night and the lines got a little shorter. Rides are a lot more fun at night for some reason.... While we were down there we also went to USC, UC Irvine, and Biola or however you spell it. Irvine and USC were nice, but the other one looked somewhat like a high school which i thought was kinda weird. After staying there for like 5 days, we went to Big Bear Lake. It was really small and really nice "cozy" little city out in the middle of nowhere. We went hikeing the first day and then during the second day the funniest thing happened. As we got to the top of the mountain, it started to snow. We're like, "we better start heading down." When we started, it got heavier and its like, "since when does it snow close to summer???" So we spent the whole time watching the snow while we were shopping. Ive never actually shopped while its been snowing. That part of the trip was kinda weird..... Before i started on my "journey" down to SoCal i got kinda sick. I think i got it on Sunday (not naming any names) during church and that kinda ruined my trip but its all good. Now its back to reality..... so excited to be going on the DC trip in 10 days. I can hang with all my azn brothers/sisters for a whole week.... Also, i finally got my youth group to change the joint meeting date with CCCAC or is it CCAC!?? I dont know! My friend Michael always says it so fast that i cant tell which one it is..sorry Thats it for now.. peace
