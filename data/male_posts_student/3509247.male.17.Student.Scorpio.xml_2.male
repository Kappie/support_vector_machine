Actually, I'm not having a bad time having the little bugars out.  I get good food (none of it is solid though).  Good things like mashed potatoes and stuffing.  Mmmmmmmmmm.  My cheeks aren't very swollen and I got to was Monk with my sister last night.  I did throw up once last night, but besides that, all is going well.  Doesn't this just beat all though:  yesterday Colleen called me and asked me if she could see me.  This was after I had woken up from my surgery and I didn't want to see anyone or do anything.  She said that she was lost so I told her and Beth how to get home.  Another something horrible is that I missed Stephanie being on yesterday!!!  Man, she was on and I missed her.  Anyways, hopefully my recovery will go by quickly.  I finally got every song on Bre's CD except for 4 optional songs.  I'll prolly get those too soon.  Anyways, the bad thing about getting these teeth out is that I'm almost always tired so I've got to go ok?  Talk to ya'll later.  -Josh  P.S.  Ice Cream tastes really good. :)
