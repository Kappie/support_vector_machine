Well, what can I say. It was fun. All I just hope now is that the interview is okay. Well guess what, I told them I wanted to be an RO. While my heart yearns to want to be an RO so that I can help the Sec 1's better, I somehow feel attracted to the QM post. Maybe it's just because my section has plenty of QM's before. Or maybe it's what I really want.        Wierd thing is, all these times I've played with the band for the school's morning assembly on Mondays, I've never once regretted it. While non-bandsmen may say that we're bloody fools to waste our time there, I feel that it's worthwhile doing.        Heh heh, Cathechism class starting again this Sunday. While my classmates feel that it's a waste of time, I find it a time when we can bond together. Just like the saying goes, "You'll never notice it until it's gone", so do I feel that way. The others will never miss it until we are all confirmed and there's no more classes.        What does all this means? Well, it certainly shows that I have a different outlook than others. Well, that's it. I'm calling it a night. Good or bad? Hard to say. Haha.
