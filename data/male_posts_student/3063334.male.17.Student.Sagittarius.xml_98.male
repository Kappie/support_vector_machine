I appreciate your optomism about the assembly, I'm not on the committee so I can just sit back with my fingers crossed and enjoy.  Did anyone approach you about being a model???  If not, we'll have you up there next year in the trashiest outfit Anchor Blue has to offer.  I can see it now...you'll be strutting your stuff down the runway, stopping, turning, throwing your jacket over your shoulder and giving a sexy, heart stopping look Derek Zoolander himself would be proud of.  You're a natural-born star, Tom.  Maybe you can guest-star as a breakdancer for the Rick White experience.  Love,  Rob
