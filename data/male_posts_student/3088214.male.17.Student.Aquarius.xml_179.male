My dad went off on him about him being the last president he liked that America's had.  I really haven't looked up anything about him, and probably am not, but from what I hear, he must've been a good guy.  Still not interesting enough for something new to talk about?  How about You park on a drive way and drive on a park way...discuss... ~CT
