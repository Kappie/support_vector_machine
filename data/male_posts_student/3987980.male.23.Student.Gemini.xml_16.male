I could probably have more fun if I could rejoin Final Fantasy XI, but my damn ISP is using technology that is blocking my PS2 from connecting. I'm thinking about getting the Window's version now that I have this laptop. I'd get alot better graphics outta it than the PS2. Just need a USP controller so I can play like I would with a PS2. I don't think I could handle the game using a compact keyboard.
