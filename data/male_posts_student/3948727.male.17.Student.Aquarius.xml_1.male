I guess now I might as well admit it. HE'S IN A SLUMP. I hate to say it but it's the explanation. He did have a fighting chance though. Until his abismol performance on the back 9. He only managed to get ONE birdie, just terrible. I don't know what to think anymore. But I have to give big ups to Todd Hamilton for winning. Even though I have to say that Inever heard of him before today.At least other tiger's are doing well. The Detroit Tigers, after their 4-2 win Sunday, have beat the Yankees 4-3 in the season series. I know it doesn't seem like much especially since it's only midseason. But come on who would've ever thought that the Tigers could beat the Yankees 1 game much less 4!! Ivan Rodriguez is absolutly MVP so far this season. He has turned the Tigers around. Granted they're still no New York Yankees or Boston Red Sox, but they are still surprising a lot of people including me. If you ask me they look like the Florida Marlins of last year. Can you say World Series?????? Ok maybe i'm jumping ahead to far. Of course i'm a hard-core Red Sox fan, but a little part of me, that little part that goes for the home team, would LOVE to see the Tigers in the World Series. But thats in the future and we have to wait until October. Have you been paying attention to the Tour de France?? I have to say I really have been paying attention. I'm one of those people who love to see records getting broken. And the fact that Lance can get his 6th Tour de France title!!!! I may not understand cycling but I understand that winning a 6thTour de France in a row isn't easily done. Probably because nobody's done it. Lance Armstrong is definitly one of the best athlete's in sports today. All the stuff he had to deal with including cancer, it's just insane to think how this man can keep this up. Well I wish the best of luckto you Lance, hopefully you'll come out on top. The only other news I have is that Vlade said that he ismost likely to end up in L.A., let's hope so. Until I get more on that story i'll leave it alone. But thats all for today and until I have more to report on the sports world.
