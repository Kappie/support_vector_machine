I've always been stuck on the same old hangup--can't get her out of my head, that sort of thing.  It has caused me to waste a lot of time.  That's not the case anymore.  There's this other person, about whom I've written in these pages before, and she... well, she has changed me, whether she knows it or not.  She has made me care about a person so deeply and so consistently that it makes the labored feelings of the past few years seem an utter waste of time and energy.  This girl is amazing.  The other night I called her just because I needed to hear her voice saying something--anything.  I don't use the phone.  I hate the phone, which is why I've become an utter IM addict.  But that didn't matter, because I had gone through the whole day thinking about her and when I'd see her next, and I finally was at a breaking point and just needed to talk to her.  And I did.  And it felt so good.  I don't know if she knows I'm talking about her.  I don't know if she's writing about me in her blog.  I don't know if she reads this or knows I read hers.  What I do know is that there is something truly wonderful growing between us.  So thank you, you, for being.
