Then we went in the pool for a really long time. We went out to eat. Since I know Hopewell Junction sooo well we went to Titmusu? Ahh no clue, all I know is my contact was stabbing me in the eye and Kaiti saw her friends (looked 5 years younger than her but was actually her age).  ::I love the Decker::  Back at the house... my eyes started watering and I couldn't stop sneezing from Jess's cats. Me, Sean  Rob went out to get allergy medicine but it didn't really help. We got back and talked alllll freakin' night. We didn't go to bed at all. I obsessed over me wanting a chocolate milkshake (I finally got one on the way to the city) and chicken.  Rob had to leave for work at 3 AM, he came back around 6ish. Our plan was to have Emily and Kaiti to hookup while everyone else was "sleeping" when Rob came back to freak him out... but no that didn't happen.  What else? Well... I love you all. I'm going to miss you so much. We have to go see Hello Dolly together!
