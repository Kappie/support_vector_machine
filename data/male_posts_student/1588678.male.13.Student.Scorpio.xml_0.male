To make things better, they had $.50 popcorn and soda and free game-play from July 25-27. What sucks is that I didn't get the chance to go to the new theatre. Instead, we went to the Brendan Theatre in Concord and to (try to) keep people their, they too had $.50 popcorn and soda. How sad. A couple of years ago they made a Century Theatre in Pleasent Hill, which I still go to. They're sweet! I hope I go soon. I'll tell you what I think about it.
