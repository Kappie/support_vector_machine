Now, after trying to figure out what that meant, I realize 'This is going to be harder than I thought'. Sure, but now, I have to keep myslef from falling over dead if she says no. Or yes for that reason.  Yes, I hae thought about calling her and asking her, but somehow that feels harder than face to face, I'm not sure why. Oh yeah, guess when the Spring Fling (Dance) is: April 30 at 6 Pm. Ok, so now I have a deadline of about 8 days 4 hours. Until I have to tellher I like her and ask her out.  I've thought about asking her out at the dance. And I've wondered if I should do that. It's amazing how many ideas of how you're going to act cool if she says no that come into your head. (Even if I bring my phone I'll be stuck for about 10 minutes waiting for my parents to pick me up. No, that's right, I'm not going for the fun of meeting people. Ok, I am, but that's not the main point here.)  Well, so far I've kept my promise about telling you people what's happening everyday. Let's see if I can keep it up.=-) See ya around. Maybe I'll get to ask her later..... Maybe I'll bend the rules and ask her out over the internet... As for you.... you..you may never know.....Muahahahaha!
