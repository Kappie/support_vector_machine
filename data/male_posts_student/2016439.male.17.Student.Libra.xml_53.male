Last testing period, I got a 1270, which I wasn't happy about (please, don't flail me; for where I want to go, I would have been laughed at for such a score), but this time I jumped up 100 points, passing the 1350 mark, and so I'm ready to make a go at it.  Next year's going to be a blast between wrapping up my GPA/test scores/AP scores to preparing for the Big Sendoff that is now only a little over a year away.  It's crazy, but oh so cool.  I spend most of my online time now at  urlLink College Confidential 's message board, which I guess is kind of sad.  But there's this aura on the boards of excitement that really is addictive.  I feel like I'm starting to get to know some of the people (even those who piss me off with there ridiculous "life or death" posts about Harvard, Yale, or whatever), and I can almost add another language to my list: the admissions lingo.  There exist such ultra-cool vocab words/acronyms as:  1) HYP(S) - Harvard-Yale-Princeton(-sometimes Stanford), usually used to signify that unattainable goal for those who are Ivy-oriented. 2) CC - Community College 3) FinAid- Financial Aid 4) ECs - extra-cirricular activities 5) NMSF/NMF - National Merit (Semi-)Finalist  And more!  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I honestly talk to some of the parents on there more than I do to my own ('specially to my mom) about the admissions process.  Sometimes, though, I just get the feeling that my family wants me to go to UT because it's the most available and the least expensive, but that's not where I want to go.  When I mention other schools (all out of state), they just get that look on their face and say, "Well, baby, if you can do it, go for it."  Whatever.  On the subject of languages, though, I've officially started learning Portuguese.  Thanks, Laura, for the CD.  It rocks face.  Surprisingly, it's (so far) the hardest one for me to learn, despite it being incredibly similar to Spanish grammar- and vocab-wise.  Seriously, French pronunciation is nothing compared to Portuguese, although I must say that I love hearing Portuguese spoken.  It sounds kind of like a lazy American who's traveled to the border of Spain and France in an attempt to learn the languages of both countires but was just too lazy to commit to either's prounciation.  Nevertheless, I get to feel the excitement of learning something new (especially a language) again, which makes me happy.  Plus, it can take my mind off of the things that I know I should be doing (*cough*studyforYoungMarineoftheYearcompetition*cough*).  Nothing like good ol' procrastination ;-)
