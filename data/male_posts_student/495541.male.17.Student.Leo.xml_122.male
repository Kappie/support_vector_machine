He's doing something with his life.  After being in the service, he's going to have a fresh start and free of debt.  He gets paid while in training in California.  Most of his expenses are already paid for.  For example food and living.  All of his money he can put in the bank and save.  That along with $50,000 for college when he's done.  Also in his position, after his time (3 years I think, might be 5) they're not going to want to let him go because linguists are hard to get.  So if he stays it's likely they'd pay him a wad.  I think if he enjoys being in the Army atmosphere, he's likely to stay.  If not, then his college is paid for and he can do whatever he wants.  Wow.  Anyways today was so-so.  School is so stressing at times.  Some things are just so screwed up and others so confusing.  Well I'm going to eat my dinner now.
