Well... felt tired again... in class... somehow Monday Blues really can get me all the time.. just cant seem to run away... Ah well, the habit of sleeping at 11 pm... lol.. and I slept late with some tossing and turning on the bed before I settled down and reach slumberland...  Had my heads on the table (again) after recess, couldnt pick up any more spirits to really take the pen and write some stuff.... just wanna sleep... time passed by real slowly then.. jeez.  Hmm... after school I just headed home, didnt have some interesting stuff to blog today, it just seemed very okay, but marred by unhappy events in the morning. Sigh. Just in a dilemma.  Really, whats there to say today.  Benedict out.
