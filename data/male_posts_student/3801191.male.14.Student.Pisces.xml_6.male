Utter, total randomness...the food of creativity...  So, here goes...   SONGS   What is it with songs these days? Why da heck do they all have to b about love, i mean, come on, not the whole frickin world is accidentally in love now are they?  Marketing ploy...HAH! I wish i could believe that...  Hey, if u want your CD to sell so badly, theres such a thing as GOOD ADVERTISING...  No need to make those in love become more gushy, and the unlucky ones feel more depressed dammit...i myself was a victim of this outrage...   GLOBALISATION   Sure...its cheaper...  But by the time it reaches you, how much do they charge u for your products?  Wat the fiack is this...they pay those poor folks like 5 cents a day...  And they sell the stuff at 30 bucks a pop???   Come on...  Is everyone blinded by the need for more and more money these days? Come on, watever happened to the spirit of brotherly love...  Theyd even exploit other human beings, just for the sake of their own greed...   ADVERTISING   Watever happened to good, wholesome advertising?   Remember the ad nokia used to have...  Yes, way bak in the heyday of the 8850...  The one where they had the town mayor playin snake while sitting barefooted on the town fountain...  The one where they had all those people smiling and having fun?  And wat are they usin now?  NIGHTLIFE...  PARTIES...  My god...  Im startin to wonder wat advertising will b like when im an adult, and my kids watch TV...  Watll we have?  Nude models?   Porn?   Wat the fiack...i certainly wouldnt want my kids to b exposed to that kinda crap  IMO, advertising is greasin to hit the skids...  One day, its gonna burst...  BURST LIKE A BALLOON FULL OF CRAP  *cough**cough*...  Yes, all i have for the moment...will now commence to slip into deep thought while chanting "waaaaatttt tttthhhhheeeee ffiiiiaaaaccckkkk"...  Cya soon peeps...
