Sigh... no mucking around with Ming for a whole week! I'm starting to miss him... Apart from the fact that i have to seek revenge on him... Mwahahaha! Yes... he will indeed recieve judgement this time... he's not getting away with it even though he lead the forgiveness study... haha...   I dun know why, I just feel like I have the energy to do wat is right now. It's just I've been lacking that energy for sooo long! I just decided to hate the world. I could see hope, but I just didn't live in hope. There is so much knowledge in my head but it just does correspond to the way I think and act. Oh wellz... Maybe if you went out for a run Fi, you might feel a little better? I dun know...  I can't make it to this week's Band coz it's on thursday. I've made a commitment of Friday and unless it suits me I won't be able to come. It's not becoz I dun love the Band like crazy, it's coz of sku and parents. It's annoying, I know, I'm sorry, I really hope that you guys can understand. When I go to Uni then maybe we can practice every week!!! : P
