We're working to create voter blocs to hold our elected officials accountable. And when that doesn't work, we'll run ourselves! This is about making a political systemthat is run by richwhitemen (and their allies of all classes, races, and genders) work for us.      Most of us feel alienated by the political process. That's what the League is about- organizing people traditionally left out of politics. But we canflip the system to WORK FOR US. And it's just ONE tool we can use increating a long-term youth movement that is going to really make change.      Find your place in the movement! We need researchers, money people,performers, posterers, photocopiers, organizational wizzes, networkers,party promoters, writers, media contacts, and other visionary folks! Tell us what you do and we'll work together. We're here for you, too, because this belongs to all of us.      Come to our first meeting, Saturday, August 7th, noon at  urlLink Coffman , Room 303.    If you want to know more, you can  urlLink email Miranda Trimmier .
