Damn it's hot as hell in my room but "f" it; I am not turning my computer off!   There is a cool motorcycle special on Discovery Channel. I don't ride or want o, but I like to watch people build things. It's like me building a story or peom but they do it with metal.   Wish me luck in school tomorrow!
