Theres no harm in it at all, hmm might get the bus into manchester on monday if i can persuade my mum to buy me some new trousers, hmmm maybe i should of gone to Oldham with them today, damn me being in bed being all lazy!, and damn my bloody knee for hurting *hits knee* damn that just made it worse *angry look* i've decided that delivering my papers in the dark is much better than delivering them whilst its light, when its dark you can have fun trying to find the letterbox etc and make peoples lights come on, hehehe its always amusing when your wlaking down the road and all these lights are on because you've just delievered a paper there, hmm i'm rambling on now.....
