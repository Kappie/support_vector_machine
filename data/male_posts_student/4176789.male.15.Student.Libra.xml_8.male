Oh well, band camp is fun, it's just very demanding. HALF-LIFE 2 has me really hyped. Physics based puzzles, destructible environs [ie- set a building on fire with a flame thrower (or blow out a support with a grenade) and the whole thing will eventually burn/come crashing down. Awesome.] Of course, it is a game, not a simulator to show off awesome stuff.[but it does that too, very well] No doubt you'll be too busy leading/joining a rebellion to have very much fun with all the cool features. Now I'm not saying you'll never be able to, at the start of the game, and between missions/objective/or whatever they're called, you'll have plenty of time for fun. Man, band camp has me all depressed, I came back from a week vacation to my grandma's and today was my last day for fun, and i had to mow, and I can't get on the internet all the time (curse you dialup!) so I didn't really have time to do what I wanted (frag people and talk them to insanity with my new mic) oh well.    And speaking of a microphone, I wish I had a not evil dog.  -Speelers of the world untie!
