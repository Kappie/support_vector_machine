About 40 min later I woke up to my mouth still throbbing in pain. Without thinking, I popped an 800mg prescription ibuprofen tablet. Then was like "oops, is that too much.."   I'm dizzy now, but apparently Joe Poisoncontrol said I'm in no real harm other than some really nice sleep I'll be experiencing soon.   I'll be damned though.. the pain disappeared.   Goodnight.
