I am going to start finals of Friday, with English from 8:00 to 10:00, then Business Law at 10:15 to 12:15. These shouldn't be that bad except my English teacher is going to use the final as a place to test our Frankenstein knowledge. Business law will be a bitch but I will get 5  extra credit points by bringing in a book cover which she says is worth 5 points. I already have a 99 average so I mean I just have to score 95 or over to keep my average up. Speaking of averages, my average is like an 84 and the people who don't do anything just talk are getting better grades than me even though I understand the material better than they do. Messed UP! My Monday final is US History from Miss Brook 10:15 to 12:15, meaning I get to sleep in late and what not, or some extra study time. We get to use our notes on this so hey I will throw in a couple of important people here and there and put all the definitions on the notes where they should be so I can get away with it.  Tuesday will be Chemistry from 8:00 to 10:00, with Mr. Yaffe, his final shouldn't be that hard but it will be rather comprehensive and have some abstract concepts. The second final that day is French 3. That final will run from 10:15 to 12:15. This probably will be my hardest and longest final. There are supposed to be over 200 questions or something like that and people from last year barely finished. Wednesday I have one final, Algebra 2 with Mrs. Pappano, this should be an easier final but it should have more on it with lots of hard work and negatives (DANGER ZONE!) This final is 8:00 to 10:00.  In the mean time I have hammer championships in New Britain tomorrow, right now I am throwing around 100 or 105 feet and last year to go Allstate you have to throw about 110 or 112 so if I do well and the weather is on my side I should make Allstate. The thing is that if I do it will be a while before they update the banners and Krebbs or anyone else will never believe me. Lots of studying to do this week but not to long till the end of school.
