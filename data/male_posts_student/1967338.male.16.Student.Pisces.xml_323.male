I require sleep to post.  Or at least I thought I did.  But apparently not.  Anyway, since then I can't stop dancing.  Whenever I hear a song I choreograph it in my head.  I think I may be turning into Micheal Humphrey.   Marten, does Kaylee read this blog?  It's just something I'd like to know.  But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'
