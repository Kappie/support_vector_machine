What they're trying to do is tarnish Kerry's image by making all sorts of wild accusations about his time in the military, and it's on TV in three swing states now (Wisconsin, Ohio, West Virginia).  The major media outlets have been timid about this story, and rightfully so. Giving too much press to these ultra-right whackos only encourages them. On the other hand, it's kind of odd that in a Google News search, it took til page two to find  urlLink a mainstream source .  Will this move backfire and consolidate middle-of-the-road Americans behind Kerry? It certainly could, and time will tell... but the blatantly hateful message of these veterans (who didn't serve on the same boat as Kerry, FYI) shouldn't help the Bush campaign much. It's just too transparent.
