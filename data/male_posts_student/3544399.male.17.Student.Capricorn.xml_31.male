All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain at stake  I see the chaos for everyone who are we what can we do  You and I are the same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change  Your's is filled with evil and mine's not there is no way I can lose   * Can't hold on much longer - But I will never let go  I know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this'll last  I'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others  Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do   OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT   Ancient city blazing  Shadows keep attacking  Little children crying  Confusion, hopeless anger   I don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy  All your cunning tricks make me sick, you won't have it your own way   *Repeat   OPEN YOUR HEART...AND YOU'LL SEE...   (Guitar Solo)   If it won't stop, there will be no future for us  Its heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free  I know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this'll last  Close my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do   GOTTA OPEN YOUR HEART, DUDE!   * Repeat   OPEN YOUR HEART, IT'S GONNA BE ALLRIGHT
