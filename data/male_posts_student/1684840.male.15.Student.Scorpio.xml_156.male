At break time the pillocks sitting across the hall decided to bomb our table with bits of food and crap.  Chirs could no longer take being pelted with bits of food, grabbed Domonic's bottle of coke, shook it, opened it slightly and bombed it across the room onto their table, splattering all of the occupants!  HILARIOUS!!  Josh went kinda psycho on Chris but in the end we couldn't stop laughing.  Mrs. Fordham saw the whole thing and also went schiz on Chris.  It was bloody hilarious!  The dinnerlady stuck up for Chris, aww    We went out of the canteen and Michaela's sister, sorry BROTHER (the smoking guy  ), started on James and had a little paddy.  He is kinda pathetic really, anyway, having formally slagged off Michaela's brother on the internet, I might be recieving more paddy abuse from tiny big guys from year 8 hehehe    Games was fun, I scored 2 rounders, plus hit Lauren with the rounders ball lol (sorry!  ), but it does happen a lot strangely.  Mrs. Lawley had her photo taken in Maths, but I think my flash drawing is better:     Also, if you missed the chicken dance flash thing,  Click Here .  Anyway, after school was fun!  I went town with Sam, Jo, and Annie and we went to the train station to enquire about the Alton Towers bus.  Turns out it costs Â£5.  Friday is gonna be SO WICKAAD!  Me and Sam went McDonalds, Annie and Jo went home, and we sat eating it outside the old church.  The Police were searching the bins for what seemed some important documents (not being nosy or anything  )  G'dnight
