The postulate was this:  For $200, a child can be clothed and fed from birth to age six, as well as given immunizations and the like.  Do you give $200 to UNICEF, or do you keep the money yourself?  Since this is an honest-to-goodness question (a person can be clothed and fed for six years if you give $200 to UNICEF), we played the game with big stakes...Noah took $200 from the petty cash and left it up to the students how to spend it.  A lot of really good points were brought up, both practical and philosophical, looking at why you would spend the money on the person and what reasons you wouldn't.  I was afraid that I would need to bring up a reason not to spend the money...play a little Devil's Advocate...but they were on the ball about it, which might not be a good thing, considering the money is still ours to spend and a pizza party was discussed.  I don't know how anyone could eat pizza with that $200.  But I wrote a screenplay about the pros and cons of giving the money.  I doubt it's any good.    I'm not as good at answering my question as I hoped to be.  We have cliques...and shockingly, the nerdy clique of RISK players is the elitist clique.  There are soccer players, pretty boys, and overall popular kids at this camp, but they're not having the most fun, and thus they get jealous when the RISK kids are yelling and creating hoopla.  Anyway, I get along best with the RISK clique for a lot of reasons...the easiest would be because they are around (during the afternoon some folks hit the library, some the store, some the basketball court...these kids stay in the place and play RISK, and since I'm on duty, I'm there with them), but also they are just like I was in high school -- interested in their things, and not really caring otherwise.  I gave up my sophomore prom to play RISK with Paul Jones and Daniel Young, and it was one of the greatest nights of my high school career.  I ended up popular in the end because I did my own thing, and somehow the popular kids realized they wanted to do those things too.    Anyway, these kids were shocked about being the elite group, and they felt awful about it.  And it's not their fault...they don't mean to be elitist...few people do, I think.  And as I talked them up and gave them pep and tried to raise their spirits, I realized that I was a member of their clique.  And not in the terms it may seem...I talk to everyone in the camp, I eat with everyone in the camp, I drive everyone in the camp, I tell everyone in the camp to get into bed...but I was being elitist to others, specifically the pretty boys most would consider the elite group.    When this started, I wanted to be that guy who you could grab for a game of something or to talk about something or whatever.  I knew I'd get groupies, and I knew I'd have to fight to hang out with everyone.  But there were three students who set themselves up as too cool for this camp, and started acting snobbish about things.  I'd walk over to them and they'd give me a look, a smile, but also a wonder about why I was there...am I spying?  I wasn't, I just wanted to know what was going on.  So after a few days, I stopped walking by.  And now, I only really talk to them when I need something or when it's discipline time.  And that's not the way to forge a relationship.  I hold power over these kids, and I can't abuse that to favor one group over the other.  I have to at least let these other kids know why I've acted the way I have, and if they want to hang out or play games or whatever, I am completely interested.  I am.  Granted, I don't have as much in common with Seth as I do with Chris...it's just how it is.  But I don't have a lot in common with a lot of my best friends...it's what makes them interesting.    I have my favorites...I won't lie.  There are eight campers or so that I really enjoy, who cheer me up and make me glad that I'm here.  I like all of the guys, and I'm sure I'd like all of the girls if I knew them as well as I know the guys.  But everyone has a few people that they enjoy more than others.  Stephen, Forrest, Chris, Cami, Jackie, Lauren, Lauren (two of 'em), and Ryan.  That list will probably change a bit over the next week.  It's my job to try to add more to that group, and to at least give everyone the opportunity to get on the list.  And when I say job, I don't mean in the sense of getting paid for something...I need to do this because it is the right thing to do.    I wonder if I can make it as a writer.  Much of writing is the reconciliation of thoughts or visions in your mind.  Some stories require writing, but a lot of ideas I've had over the past week or two get talked out because I'm around such a nurturing group of people and we're always talking.  Maybe it just hurts the blog.  I'm sorry, blog.
