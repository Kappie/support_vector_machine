But no, builders have started clearing the garden by starting a big bonfire, although how they managed to light a fire with the amount of rain we had today I don't know. Even as I type this, the embers are nowhere near dying. Also, the roof above the bathroom has given in t the rain, flooding the lower area of the bathroom. Not good. So, with the elements attacking everything outside, I wisely decided to stay indoors, where I have food and computers. That's about all for today, because theres only a limited amount of interesting things you can do while sitting on a sofa all day. Tomorrow another post will follow.
