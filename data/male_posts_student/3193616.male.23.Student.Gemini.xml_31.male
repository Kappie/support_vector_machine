They have grown through confrontation and their identity is confrontation, armed or otherwise. The Congress had to come to terms with this cocky attitude of ommunists- else, the Govt might not last for it's term. They still live in the Ivory Towers and they also dream of bringing IT Industry under Trade-Unions. I am afraid if their confrontaionist approach will spoil the IT Sector also. When the seat of Communism- West Bengal itself has told that ITITES sector is out of Strikes, I dont know why they need to take up these issues and reduce the attractiveness? The HR dept of all these Firms themselves deal with these issues quite effectively and the workers there arent "Proletariat" for the Trade Unions to intervene.
