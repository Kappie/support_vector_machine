We were short players (only 10 showed up) until I saw two kids from the younger age group that we had brought up to play with us. This was the first game since the beginning of the season in which we had a sub! I was so happy. We played a good first half, only down 1-0. But at half one of our players were kicked out of the game by the coach for talking back, we were back to square one. We ended up losing... but it wasn't  that  bad. but today I am not here to rant about soccer (as you know I can do perfectly well) so let's talk about some other things.  Right now I am listening to music. I like Disney Music a lot. It is very fun to listen to, especially for me because it reminds me both of my childhood, and my trip to Disney World.  I also like Evanescence. They are much darker, and somewhat suicidal >_>. But I like them nonetheless, their music is easier to relate to then "I know that your toxic!".   Well I have to go... tata for now and Hakuna Matata!  Anita.
