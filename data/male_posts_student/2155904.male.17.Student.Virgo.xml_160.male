What else could be the cause of his constant longing for companionship?  Tyke is so very frustrated by his own mind.  The curses he puts himself through on a daily basis are seldom overlooked by the excitement of the occasional day or night of company with another.  In a year that has so many new experiences for Tyke, the only real experience he wants to see is one that he is forced to wait for until at the earliest, the summer is over.  Tyke spends a hefty portion of the hours yearning for the seconds that he gets to spend with his crush.  Desiring only to hold her in his arms or just to be in her immediate company, Tyke beats himself up over what he does and says and cannot stay focused on what he is doing.  Tonight Tyke tried watching a movie but he just got up in the middle of an action-packed scene and went into his bedroom to look at her.  Then he went back to the TV and sat down only to realize he knew not what he wanted to do.  He managed to regain himself somewhat and began to lift weights and do ab work but this became tedious and unfulfilling after only minutes of exercise.  So once again he returned to his recliner and leaned back stroking his hair the way he wishes the girl would do for him.  Be it the touch of another or the emotional attachment involved with another, Tyke is much too high-strung to be alone in his deserted house.  What is the answer?  So Tyke is invited to hang out or asked if he wants to do something by a friend but he will at times decline the offer simply to be alone.  He knows that he won't be content doing nothing with another guy around that does not understand what Tyke is going through at the moment.  The only person that has made it known to Tyke that he understands exactly what it is Tyke feels is seldom around to talk to and even if he were it does not mean it would solve anything.  Unfortunately, Tyke is afraid there is only one cure.  But this cure would have several steps, all of these ending in more heartbreak for Tyke come the end of summer.  This may be the worst time for Tyke to really want a relationship but although he realizes this he can't stop himself from feeling the way he does.  This has no purpose.  This blog has done nothing.  The entries in here are in no way a full representation of Tyke's thoughts.  For if they were his life would actually become worse.  Damn this.  Damn everything that makes Tyke feel so miserable at times.  Damn Tyke's manic nature that causes him to live such an emotional rollercoaster.  Most importantly, damn the fact that Tyke is so upset over something he can't change.  Nothing in Tyke's life seems to be able to change right now.  4 months will bring immense change however.  But all Tyke wants is for his current status to change.  Arrghh...Tyke is so frustrated.  So very frustrated.  His curiosity heightens when he is at these moods and that is a source of minor fright for Tyke.  For he does not like that he can become so focused on one flaw in his life that it causes him to begin to ponder what other things in life are like.  He knows that at this stage in his life he is in control but he also knows that down the line he could have a startling moment in his life that could alter his control.  Wow, this was a horrible decision to write in the blog.  Not only did it not make much sense to Tyke, it scared him.  It scared him of himself.  And Tyke is the one person that Tyke can't shake.
