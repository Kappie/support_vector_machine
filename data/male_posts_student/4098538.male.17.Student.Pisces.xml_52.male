I have to say (and I don't give a fuck who rips me for this) the new Slipknot album is pretty amazing (except the really queer acoustic songs which just AREN'T Slipknot). 'Three Nil' is the best song so far. Anyway, today I got really hyped up and ready to cut my hair. I was gonna do it. The only reason I didn't is because Mandy stayed late at college and it is her hairdresser that was supposed to be doing it. And now I have gone into the mood where I couldn't bear to cut it (I go through weird hair moods)! But oh well. I shall wait until next time around. I am thinking that tomorrow, after college, I may go to the hairdressers and get my hair (which is now almost 50cm long) cut off. I am gonna look so weird(er). I just can't be bothered looking after it anymore. If it is only 3/4/5 inches long I could just get up in the morning and not do a thing to it when I go out. Ah, that sounds like bliss. I'll write about what happens tomorrow. I am so bored right now. I fell asleep in the damn bath before. It's fucking scary waking up in a cold bath. I haven't even had a proper meal all day either because my mum made something I didn't like. It had tons of vegetable crap in. But oh well. That gives me an excuse to get some chips mateeeeee. Ah fuck this.
