I'm sick and tired of them, because they made me spend the night there once. Unacceptable.  Their dad is a blubbering drunk(who acts the same when hes drunk as when he's sober), the mom tries to act nice all the time, but she's pulling her hair out, and looks like the most stressed person in the world. The older brother pisses me off because he seems to refuse to not slur his words- he also has some kind of thing in his head that makes him think i'm friends with him. The older brother is the one that got me into all this, who became friends with my brother, and in turn my family met them, so blah.
