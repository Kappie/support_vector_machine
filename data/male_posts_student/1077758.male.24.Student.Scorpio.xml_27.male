Almost no day is the same as the other, with more new elements being tossed into the proverbial salad every 8 hours I work.  Today while I was doing my onerous duty of cleaning the restrooms (The mens, if you must know) I happened upon some pamphlets promoting basic Christian dogma.  Something about the fact that these people have been dropped to the level of leaving the word of God in a public bathroom is simply disturbing.  Is it the hope that while doing those basest of bodily functions, this person will suddenly see the literature lying there, read it, and have a spiritual epiphany whilst doing so?  And in further irony, I have yet to see any of these pamphlets in the women's bathroom at all.  So either the men doing this don't have the nerve to simply dump a couple of the pamphlets inside of the women's door, or they've decided that the women simply aren't worth it. I'm pretty sure that's slightly demeaning.  Seeing colorful pictures of happy people with "Jesus Lives!" or a somberly painted crucifix with "The Second Coming" in boldface above it serves as a background for bathroom brainwashing.  Knowing somebody else would later anyway, I toss the pamphlets in the toilet and flush them with the rest of the human offal.
