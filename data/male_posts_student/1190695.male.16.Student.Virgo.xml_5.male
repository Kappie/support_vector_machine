It seems I forgot to tell most people, as John called me on my cell phone while I was driving through Revelstoke, BC, on the way to Canmore, Alberta.    Our trip took us through Salmon Arm, BC, to Canmore, Alberta, which is very close to Banff and Banff National Park (read: mountains). Then back to Kelowna, BC, for a couple of days before returning to Vancouver and Surrey to schmooze with the relatives. I'll compose a travelogue over the next couple of days, complete with pictures (I snapped almost a full 256MB SD card full of them).    I'll leave you with a tune by the Arrogant Worms:    'Cause we've got  Rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees   And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And rocks and trees  And trees and rocks  And water!     All right, everyone!
