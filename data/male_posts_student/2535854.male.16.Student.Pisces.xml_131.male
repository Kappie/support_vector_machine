Well what to start off with...i`m going on emotions right now..and whats on my mind right now most importantly.Sigh.I`m homesick.Yeah I miss home..Kent,Ohio is still home to me..it has a special place in my heart...Now its summer holidays there...schools out for three months for everyone there...sigh and here is schoolling time and year end holidays are only 2months..sigh..its summer over there..and the weather beautiful.It may be hot but hell its baseball season baby!The flowers have grown..waiting to be plucked and blown or given to someone has a nice,friendly,loving gesture..the sprinklers are on...perfect time to go swimming or grab a tan...go on vacation...go outside and play with your friends...or relax and saviour the moment..and catch up on a book..visit the nearest mall..sales..shopping or go out and eat...roadtrips...or even summer classes for those who want to graduate early or catch up or revise what they have learnt or are gonna learn in the next schoolling year..no more waking up early to catch the bus to school...no more bringing around bag full of school books but bringing a bag of clothes to wear when you sleep over at your best friends place..the movies right now are hot..and definately benefitting from modern technology which is making them evem more and more exciting..or in fact get a job?paper boy?run the ice cream stall?why not get some extra pocket money and cash?And did I forget to mention ice cream...?Oh so many flavours to choose from...and all are nice in their own special way..Klondikes...Popsicals..Creamsicals..so many..why not attend a baseball game with dad or ur friends sigh..so much to do...and more time than we people over here in M`sia get...an endless ammount of activities to do and take part in!!!  I look back at my Walls Elementry yearbooks.(I haven`t in a long time and don`t want to)Or when I look back at them.So saddening.Depressing even...but well things change..times..places..people..maybe its better that i`m back here now?I wonder..and with all this terrorism and at times racial war-fare....I guess its better here man..  Now the next one: Ive been out everyday!Look at my previous entries...ive gone out every single day..and to have fun?Rarely.Much less compared to everyone else.Only lunch with Cheryl and Eugene..Klgcc with Raimie,Syamir and Loong and then the party at Stefan`s place.Never once have I gotten to go to the mall and have fun or watch a movie.I only went for maybe a few minutes on a few occasions to attend to problems with my computer and my printer.and I have yet to go shopping :'( ...Was in Sunway but parents didnt wanna go!And my last Saturday didnt go!Thats why I was so moody as well..sad even..no 1utama or Pyramid..I will NOT GO to Mid Valley to shop these holidays and will try to now these days.Thanks so much Sarah!Made me feel better..lighten up..:D and for everyone out there..Sarah is a special friend to me!Makes me feel better..wuv u hun!  Money Matters: Been spending a bit on drinks at Starbucks..sigh..it`ll never change though.I`m owed rm100..not that its a big deal to me..i`m financially fine for my needs and stuff.  School :? My holiday homework isn`t done...my sej project is in shambles...and not even 1 bit to being done but what to do and how to do is a complete mystery..oh well..I likely fucked my exams..am so gonna get it from my parents..oh well..whats done is done..just hope I can make up for my mistakes..  Friends: Never got to get Sarah that coffee =p..oh well..I guess ill spent her in some way..looks like I wont see Eugene for a while..nice guy..saw Cheryl for the 1st time in 2weeks and bla..Chaman...old friend...been reliving times so similiar to last year..new problems but same people involved..sigh..will things ever change?Screw Raimie the fucking smoker...and to everyone else...hope you enjoyed the holidays...and Mich:Sadly couldnt make it for that coffee..sad..your perhaps the only person (?) that I miss...sigh..And hmm that bickering between Jen,Chaman and Mich..?Could it just fucking end already??!!??I dunno man...  Well my holidays started like perhaps a day earlier cause I didnt go to school on the last Friday of the first school term year:.The night before or Thursday night was at Saturday night fever!that so rocked.Then lunch with cheryl and Eugene...talked alot.and Klgcc with they guys.Those are like my only fun moments in addtition to meeting up Chaman and remembering the old days..yet the same problem still exists..and lets say in more ways than one!  Euro 2004 is starting.I`m up waiting and praying for a game to be telecasted.Its now 3:11am at this point of time and i`m not a single bit tired.Maybe perhaps the night owl right now.Can`t wait to see the matches!I`m so gonna go jump into a cafe or a restaurant showing a game with the guys or whoever wants to!But this is Bangsar...it won`t be quiet (yaay!) and will be packed and seats will be hard to get but lets go for it! :>)!!  Looking back at the moment for now..I guess I can say my holidays are fun or have been fun.And not to many worries..for instance look at Brendan and Wei Ning(Michelle Ren) at Stella Maries have to worry about.Their exams are in like 10 days or so from this very moment as I type.Sure they can take a break and relax but they have to study kinda of course (but so do I but didn`t :p) but they have something immenent to worry about and not be happy...The downside of not exams at the same time as everyone else but later.Same goes for Zhen Cui and the rest of those CHS people I know..exams after holidays..oh so glad i`m in a school that has exams before the holidays.Sadly standards here are high and the questions are tough..the paper formats are forever constantly changing and always cause less time ultimately for a paper and yet plenty for another subject or paper which isn`t so time needin as another.To bad it can`t be added up and donated to a time when you really need it.Anywayz enough on this part of this blogging!Good luck to them in their exams..  Now moving on to something else..looks like cant spike up hair anymore in the morning..hopefully no1 will notice my copper air :p.They didn`t last time or they did or Nikki did and it took 3 or 4weeks.Even people across the canteen were asking ppl who knew me were like "did he dye his hair"..its obvious!Just a pic of me and Chen on rehersal day I belive?My hair had been cut but the front part of my hair still had dye on it and it was so bloody different than the naturally black parts of my hair!Shocking that the prefects were so stoned,blur or just oblivious to it!!  Ive this weird blogging habit now during the holidays!Its just so..wanna blog man!Like the papers say!Online diarys/journals or weblogs or blogs are becoming popular amongst Malaysians.Being one,I say it like lets me let out my feelings,frustrations and what not and emotions and ugh as well let me voice out anything and everything!Look at Mich`s blog.Or its comments.*shrugs* oh well...not everything is perfect..as you can see..ive realised backround music is perhaps rather irritating so ive gotten rid of it unless I can find a sombre mood tune to play...And ive also changed the colours of certain parts of my blog to let it be distinctively different from the other parts and let it be know as the other part of the blog or another section or something thats not just quite related to eachother though they are related to eachother in a way.Damn I need to learn more HTML.Ok dammit my laptops 'H' letter or key is sometimes being a pain in the ass...you think??  Now for a rather touchy subject that I would rather avoid but I just can`t now could I ;)?This entry wouldn`t be complete without it.But this entry will never be complete as said.Now here goes for this:  Well hmm..even Nik`s had a gf before me and he`s like some whack0..heh..but hmm...still something ive yet to experience but happy to leave it alone..though it at times is tearing away at me and memories.I still try to keep my heart burried deep down inside and unable to be accessed from the surface..but more deep down...which means perhaps only people Ive known for a long time and most importantly CLOSELY will be told of whats in that clouded or strangely worked heart of mine.Though they themselves will never find out whats there.Thats for me to know and for you to NOT ever find out.Yes thats right.But it does suck kinda to be lonely and what not..I honestly don`t feel loved.I just don`t!And if I actually think someone does appriciate me,I always feel so paranoid of losing them or doing something which will ultimately end it or something.Yes..thats why in my friendster profile I say i`m paranoid.And to some people,these facts would be like confidential to themselves and trusted ones..although here the whole damn world can view em,I doubt anyone does..and if they do..would they care?Bet not!And care about me or anything??Even bigger NO!Sigh...oh well..i`ll just have to do without this for a long time or forever as it seems to be...Maybe that someone will pop-up one day..oh well..but as who for now perhaps...I aint saying 'who'.  Im having a sandwhich..gonna go down and wash the plate..grab a drink and wash my face,brush my teeth and come back here...its like 3:40am now..  Its Three minutes later.I`m back...but only washed my plate and had a drink..RC Cola in fact..reminds me of Stefans party..over 30 bottles of soda...and mine were the more popular ones!RC Cola baby!And now ive grabbed a York.Its a circular peppermint patty with mint inside.My favourite candy.Asked my dad tog et it for me while he was in the USA almost 3months ago.Yes.It`s a long time ago but hell...its still great :D.At 1st resisting it was a problem..now as time passed and the less and less they were..I could so easily pass like passing up having dinner at a mamak restaurant.Wanted to save some for these holidays to saviour.And save em I have!Still only ate a few during the holidays...sad though..me that is..heheh :'(....  At least my braces are in place and what not.And theres a bright side of things to look foward to...can see my friends when school starts again...will be getting my sunglasses soon..and as for 2moro.or now today.Going out.Have some things to attend to other than a function which I don`t know if i`m going and theres still that faint hope I`m still going shopping!  Wow.Its not 3:50am...im talking to Juan(hmm actually hes left 2 eat =p),Ming (but she aint replied in an hour but not that I care) and Wei Ning...I guess they are just like me..in the same club...sad school is starting and is all sad and depressed and dreading Monday and feel that sleeping on the last available 'fun' hours of the holidays is a waste..Mm this York is good.  And omg!Im missed the beggining of Euro 2004!I said hi to Wei Ning and she said the things on and like "omg!"!Portugal lost 2-1 to Greece!Shocking!And just watched Spains match...they looked good near the end..Valeron scored on the hour mark..1st touch coming on as a substitute!!Omg!Heh.My Pick is still err Italy baby!Oh and thanks so much Wei Ning :D :D :D ..hehehehehe.  an nows it almost 5am...I My Heart Will Go On (Instrumental) By Kenny G is on..over and over..sad eh?But hey!My mood is up!Not so depressed now!Hehehe.Ya think?5 am on the dot!Took three hours on and off for this entry!And don`t worry..nothing suicidal.Theres much more to say but i`m afraid thats personal to all you people out there!Sorry!And it shall forever remain that way..unless something or someone happens and/or comes along hehe.  Luv,  Riz!
