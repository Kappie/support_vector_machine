You see in 5th grade we slept in the den watching HBO porn 2 in the morning and Joe made some kick ass buttery popcorn. Last night I forced them to ride bikes to Ralph's ices. Today we attacked each other with eggs and hoses. Joe got a new motor car, it doesn't work, haha! Oh and yesterday I had an Aftermath band practice and I went to Circuit City with Joe (Joe bought a PS2 because his was broken and he wants to use it on his trip and then return it when he gets back) and then I bought these headphones to protect my ears and give out good sound when I drum but they suck and I'm returning them. The idiot didn't know what the hell he was talking about. There were even ones for Studio shit there but he's like nah get these, turns out they were airplane headphones. Bastard. I'm gonna return them tomorrow. Hopefully Guitar Center, well I know they know what they're talking about. They're the pros. Tomorrow I also have another Aftermath practice and Saturday is the show at Molly Blooms 2 in Amityville. Yea so I dont know what the fuck is going on with this softball league. I pay 20 bucks for nothing. I haven't gone to any of the games so far and next week I'll miss all the game because of Montauk and I'll only end up going to the last game and the playoffs. But now I have to pay extra $8 for a god damn shirt, I wanna plant a bomb on Smithtown Rec and watch them all melt to death and laugh hard. NO I'M ONLY JOKING EASY THERE YOU FAGGOTS WHO HACK INTO THIS BLOGGER AND TELL GEORGE BUSH. But I'm gonna go to the game after Montauk and have a blast, strip naked and make my own shirt that says JACK FUCKING RABBITS and on the back it says GOO with the number 9. Awesome. Yea, so that's basically it, tomorrow I'm all full of things to do like Aftermath and drums and I think at night I'm jammin with Cozz and Stevo. The Almighty James - "BAI!"
