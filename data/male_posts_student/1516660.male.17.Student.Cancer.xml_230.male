Okay, the morning was pretty boring. In the afternoon, I went swimming with Ben. Ahh...long long long time never go swimming le. HaHa. Feel kinda awkward for awhile...even forgotten the strokes for awhile. HaHa!   After swimming, I went to Cuaseway Point to buy the remaining presents (Amanda's, exchange's and EC's). I brought every single of them at Metro, the Trim shop where Wendy works. HaHa. Go and bother her. Her colleague said I am like a primary school kid. HeH.  When I came back, I recieved a shocking news. Tina, along with the chalet food, is taking my father's taxi to the chalet tomorrow. I was like, wtf.... I thought I told them I am not bringing the food, and MeiYing said they will bring there themselves. I am also quite pissed off lor....but in the end, agreed to fetch Tina and the food la.   After that, went to watch Friends and went to sleep (it was the longest sleep I had in two days. Tell ya why later.)   TUESDAY   Chalet day! HaHaHa! Yeah...I met Ben and HuiMin at 10 (they came to my house), Fathe fetched us, the whole lot of group to chalet (we picked Tina and food up along the way). We reached there at about 10.30++ la.   Hm...the chalet was a bit cramped. A short while later, they went to rent bikes/skates. Manda, Wendy, Ben, HM and LeYu all rented something. Me, Hann and KeYun didn't rent anything.   We went to eat lunch at a nearby foodcourt. We shared a herbal chicken and some noodles. HaHa. Eat eat there, and then talk. After eating, the three of us went to the beach to look at the sea, talk and relaxed. I forgotten what we talked about le, but it was very relaxing. HaHa. I felt like a kinda a bond between us. Possibly from us going to church together ba... HaHa. I like that kind of feeling.   After lazing around, we went back and saw a Channel U filming in progress. I don't know for what show la. Just watched them filmed lor. After that, just played things here and there. Talk with Amanda, HM and Ben in the pool (Amanda tried to splash water at me several times, and I was hit. HAHA!), watched people played pool.  XiaoXi and SuPing came to chalet! After a fair bit of milling around, we had a bright idea to rent a MahJong set to play with. There are some stores that rent MahJong for us to play. With that in mind, we excitedly went out to rent MahJong set. After renting, we picked up CQ and WQ, who just came.   Soon, the MahJong set delievered. Me, XiaoXi, SuPing, Hann and Wendy started playing MahJong. We took turns to play la. Ohter people joined in too, like KaiLun, JinHong and WeiLin. (That WQ critisized my playing techniques! Excuse me! As a MahJong player, I know what I am doing. I got my unique set of strategies! Ha! These helped me hu a lot of times okay!!) We played until 10+ (from 4+pm). I hardly had anything to eat. I only ate noodles and chicken wings (thanks Ah Ji again). I hued quite a little. HaHa.  We present exchanged. I got John's present (a monkey). Ah Ji and WQ had to go back first, so I collected their prezzies for them. I got a book from Wendy and Amanda, a box full of foods and goodies from Ke Yun, a Harry Potter owl from Chun. Thanks gals!!   After a short while, all of us went to the beach. We looked at the stars shining in the sky. We pointed to our stars and wish something on it. :D We looked out to the sea and feel it's calmness. We sang songs. HaHa. I was smsing Benjamin how to come here when everyone shouted! It turned out that they saw a shooting star. Darn!! I missed it! O.o!! I felt so ke xi. Sigh.... At 11++, we went back to the chalet.   WEDNESDAY   Ahh...Wednesday came so fast. We went back to chalet. We were supposed to pack the Christmas tree and go to sleep. Alas, we were distracted by the MahJong tiles. So, we played MahJong lor. HaHa. Wendy mentioned that when I hu right, I got a tone of cockiness. HaHaHa. I am like just happy that I hu lor. Huing is very hard you know. HaHa. I sure never notce....so O.O!   Around 3+, people started to get drunk. Andi was drunk first. Then Faiz. Oh my god. That was the start of the horror that would huant us until the end of the chalet. Okay....Hann was in danger. KeYun saw drunk Faiz coming and told Hann to go up the room and lock himself in. Luckily he managed to do so, or else he would have been beaten up. Sensing danger, Wendy told us all to go up. I practically ran up to the room. I am in danger. Hello! I am always being bullied by him. I am in mortal danger.  After Wendy pulling in JunZhong (he was being punched by Faiz), she locked the main doors. All of us were in the room lor, being safe and protected. I called XiaoXi they all (they were at the beach), telling them not to come back becaase of Faiz. Wei Lin in there was blaming himself, because he encouraged them to drink. He wants to apologize all of us and we forgiving him before he can go to sleep (he was drunk, but not really drunk). We never blamed him for this lor, yet he felt very guilty. I gained a whole new understanding and respect for Wei Lin. All of us said that we forgive him and encouraged him to rest. Meanwhile, that drunkard started hitting things at the door, wanting to break up the door. After some commotions, more door hitting, security guards came. They stopped the commotion.  Oh my god. The porch was in a mess. He threw noodles, mahjong tiles, even charcoal at the door. Terrible! We were ordered by the person-in-charge to clean up la. He even threw MahJong tiles everywhere, including the pool. Idiot. It took quite a while but everything was cleaned. We finished at about 6+am lor. One MahJong tile went missing, and not found.   Ya know...all of us felt pretty angry lor. He has to drink and spoil everyone's mood. Such an irresponsible idiot. He even cracked Amanda's phone, destroying it. Ergh! A lot of us hates him lor.   At 7, we went out. Me, Wendy and Ben were waiting for my father to fetch us. Ergh. We went out to the lobby to wait for my father (idiot person said cannot sleep there. toot!). At 8+, he arrived. There's a jam at the highway or something. As the car drives out, Madonna's Profusion is playing. It's so coincidential that the same song was playing when we are entering the chalet. HaHa.   I slept on the journey. We dropped Wendy off at Causeway Point and Ben at his house. Dad took me to eat breakfast at 768 (fried carrot cake) and fetched me home. HaHa. He didn't want to work anymore. After a nice long bath, I went to sleep.   I slept for 3 hours, from 10 to 1. HaHa. I woke up, still tired, but had to wake up. Parents brought back chicken rice, so I ate that for lunch. I went online for awhile, then set off le. I went to Wendy's house first to put the christmas tree back, then onwards to Cuaseway Point to meet XC.   He's like 55 minutes late. I am so glad I brought my Reader's Digest along, so I read about half the book while waiting for him. When he arrived, we went to buy presents. We then met Huimin, where she shopped for my present (for Melvin). Later, Mel arrived, then followed by EC and Ben. Me and EC exchanged prezzies. All of us travelled to Orchard, where we are gonna eat Seoul Garden.   We had to wait quite a while before we gets seats, but never mind la. As long as we got seats. We ate from 7 till 9.30. HaHa. We grilled meat, ate some soup thingys, and keep refilling our cups. Wah...I fell so bloated. HaHa. I owe XC $15, because he helped me pay for the meal. HaHa.   After coming out of Seoul Garden, we found a seculded spot and began our presents exchange. HaHa. I got a cup from EC, a photo frame from HM, some acessories from XC (whihc includes a bag, some handphone chains), a cat mug from Ben and a cat plushie from Melvin. HaHa.   After that leh, we squeezed through Orchard. Oh my god. It was sure damn crowded. Squeeze squeeze until the MRT. Me, Ben, XC and Mel took the train to City Hall, where Ben met his mother. He went to the hotel with his mom, while the three of us milled around waiting for him. When he finally did arrived, it was midnight. YaY! Merry Christmas!   THURSDAY   We went to Mel's place to play MahJong. Tong xiao MahJong. HaHa. We played with money. Darn. I cannot object. I have no money whatsoever. HaHa. One of my biggest win is the hand with 7 pairs. Everyone gives me $3.20. HaHa. but darn, I lost most of it when I hu wrongly. Darn darn darn!!! I lost all interest in playing then. I was bankrupt le la.  I left Mel's place at 7.30. Me and XC took 913. I went back to my house, took a bath and went to sleep. I hardly even have energy to eat breakfast. HaHa. Again, I slept for 3 hours, from 10 to 1. So, in total, I slept for 6+ hours in 2 days. That's an record! HaHa!   After waking up, I watched my recorded tapes. I only managed to complete watching the Ben Yue episodes and Charmed. I'll watch the rest later la.   After tape watching, I went online and surfed the Net. I then went for dinner, watched TV, and tada. I am here blogging.  I apologize if everything sounds very rushed, espeically at the end. I am very darn tired. I even got some anger to vent, but I guess I'll have to do it tomorrow. Ayiah, what else would anger me so greatly other than WQ's foul mouth and his stupid words? Don't even use his brain to think for a slightest bit before saying out inappopiriate things.   Alright, I think I am going le. See ya tomorrow. A very good night, blog!
