In his blog “Holy crap churches Batman!!”, he clearly stated his opinion (although be it misguided) on religion. He’s possessed by Satan. He hasn’t seen the light either. Just a poooor deer caught in the headlights of the giant freight train of atheism! So anyway... I feel that it is my duty, as an open-minded person, to share the other side of the story....... The RIGHT side at that! Yes... I admit. My true religion is Jedi. But I also practice Christianity on the side. Yeeeep! Matt throws em up... And I just keep hittin em dowwwwn! Booya!!!!! Eat THAT! You Suck! God will strike you down with lightning!  Yes, in the past, christians have done some bad things. Very bad things. Even in the present. However...... So did Adolf Hitler. And All the kings in Europe. And the president of the united states of America. Lots of them. It all boils down to a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. Religions try for a perfect wholesome life, but it doesn’t always succeed. Just like normal human beings, they make mistakes. Which brings me to the priest rapists. Lets see... How many priest rapists are ther actually.... about 20 in total? Maybe? Now... Lets tally up the people who have at any time molested someone, and are NOT priests (Yes Matt. I’m including you in this survey) about 2000000 in the U.S. alone? Not to mention the 70 year old men that sit on the internet all day trying to pick up small children. Like Matt. Again. Mistakes made by these priests. (note: Just for the record, I am not sticking up for people molesting children. And I DO NOT molest them myself. Thank you for your time.) At least the priests have somewhat of an excuse! They have to live alone all their lives with no one. Except God. God is great... But there are certain ahem things in life that cough cough only another human being can fulfill. I mean, how would you feel knowing that you’re never going to get any?? (Again. I do not rape children, and am in no way supporting the decision to rape anyone). At least the other child molesters (like Matt) have a chance! And Does Matt get all the media attention that priests do when he touches a child? No! That’s the answer! If you turn him into* snicker *“Father Matt” *snicker snicker * he’d be nailed * HAHAHAHAHAHA FATHER MATT! * by the media instantly! They scavenge off of big stories. A slip by a holy man is a big story. Feedin time!  All religion convey reletively the same message, whether they admit it or not (hindu guy: what the heck were the christians thinking??? They put their Vishnu on a cross!). They all have “comandments”, if you will, against good things like murder, adultery,  stealing......... Where would we be without these happy little things???? I’d say getting rid of em is a pretty good deal.   And by the way... It’s not necessarily the religious people killing abortion doctors! There’s absolutely no proof! None! Just because they look down on it doesn’t mean they hire hit men. In fact, for all you who have actually taken the time and GONE to church to see both sides....... You would notice that they condemn these acts as much as the abortion act itself.  In conclusion, the world would be corrupt without the unwriten laws of every religion. It’s a CHOICE to be a part of the religion, and to follow it. There’s no one forcing you to do anything that you don’t want to do. It’s just a little extra conscience. Like having 2 angels instead of one on your shoulder!   And I’m glad that Matt doesn’t expect anyone to believe what he’s saying. Because YO MAMA! And your opinions are all easily smack downed! My advice is to not try and take it outside with the big guy upstairs.   Amen  -Louis lol
