Before sending me hate mail, please let me explain. We are losing about 2 US soldiers a day. And for what cause? To get the Bush Administration more money from the Oil Industry. Now here is a nice graph.     This graph sure makes on think, doesn't it? The Bush Administration is leading the US into something we can't undo. We will be stuck in Iraq forever. We have yet to win the War of Terror. No bin Laden. No Saddam. No WMD. Who are you voting for? Bush and his lies? Or Democratic? Me? I'm voting for Clark, Dean, or Gephardt. I'm undecided at the moment. Why? I'm still looking into the education packages each candidate offers. And where they stand on Iraq, the War on Terror, and Foreigh Realations (yes this includes mending the hole with the French).
