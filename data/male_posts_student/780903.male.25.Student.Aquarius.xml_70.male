Well, that sounds quite a bit more important than my last cell phone conversation, "...pepperoni, and a large cheesy bread."  (Okay, okay, my last cell phone conversation wasn't really ordering a pizza.  I haven't ordered a pizza on my cell phone ever I don't think, but it just sounded like the right punchline there, so I didn't want to let the joke fall by the wayside.  I know I shouldn't start inventing anecdotes, but the main part is real, I swear. Okay, it's almost real -- I changed the name of the city so on the off chance this person I don't know has stumbled onto my weblog, I won't have revealed secret merger information that he may get annoyed at.  But the rest is all true. Promise.)  I spent part of the day taking my class notes from the past week and separating the wheat from the chaff (is that a real phrase?  At first I wanted to say separating the curds from the whey, but I don't know which of those you save and which you toss, so I won't go with that).  That was just as much fun as it sounds.
