RebelAfrika-  Hapana. Ninajifunza Kiswahili kwa Mwalimu "Ika" pa Chuo Kiku cha Compton.  Sinafahamu. Im still "very much" at a beginners level...forgive me when I don't understand.   Haha.  He's pretending I don't suck at Swahili.  I invented that grammer.   Dead Prez has finally started to release songs for their Sophmore Album.  Great stuff, but they sound to ready for the revolution in the stuff.  Makes me wanna burn an American Flag (or put up an Esperanto flag because those are happy).  Speaking of which, I really do mean that "Mi frandzis via patrino".  Ofcourse that implies I only did "that" to one persons mother.... So assume I'm speaking you my one reader.
