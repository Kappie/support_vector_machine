I'm taking a study break and just discovered that LOLA posted some fantastic-fun pictures from the other night that we spent together.  I posted about that night (see post from Sat, March 20th) and so I think I will share the link to her picture page she created.  It is devoted solely to that evening, and a few tidbits of information related to how we became Friends Forever Graduation Song by Vitamin C, etc and so on.  If you know what I'm referring to, you are laughing.  If you don't, you're stupid AND confused.  Anyhow, here is the link.   urlLink TAKE A LOOK .  Such a nice job Lola!  Enjoy the pictures, leave a comment for me, and get off my blog.  :)
