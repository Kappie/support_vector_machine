The history exam was piss easy because it was a source paper and there wern't too many questions unlike last time >:( ! 2) I went to see Mr Mathieson (or however its spelt) to get my sixth form induction sheet. Yeh thats right! I'm going to sixth form! ^.^ Hoorah! But now I'm not sure if I want to do french or not. Maybe I'll do biology? 3) I went to Pete's house (as if you all know him...) with Brownie, Dave, Kirsten and Steve. I don't like Steve much. We then travelled to Daves house to retrieve my monkey hoody...and then to Steves to check his dog wasn't dead ;) 4) We all went into plymouth, managed to get child tickets and headed to subways (mmmmm!) we then went about the shops and I got mocked for working in freezeways :( argh! 5) We went to the guitar shop and I sat there all jealous and grumpy 'cos I can't play. I really wish I could, I must learn. But first I must find enough money to pay for my guitar...and my new phone...and my MP3 player...and my Green Day T shirt. Life is SOOO unfair! - Kevin stylee 6) Came home, and wrote on here.  Now, I know that wasn't interesting but I'm bored as fuck, so live with it!
