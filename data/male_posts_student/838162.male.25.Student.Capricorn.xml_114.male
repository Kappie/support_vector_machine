With some of the modules requiring weekly assignments, this term looks to be a killer. But then again I always say that at the start of each new term.    >   It has been awhile since i last beta tested for something, so I took some time off awhile ago to try out some new online game worlds. Of the three I’ve tested, only one seemed engaging, which is totally normal for these sort of things. This is because for all the concepts they can come out with; only a few companies have that formula where they can balance all the factors during the development and conception phases. This does not even include the stability and gameplay issues that may arise from Live 24/7 gameworld uptime. How with all of the game companies currently gathered in L.A. for  urlLink E3 , the annual exhibition for Electronic-interactive Entertainment, it will be interesting to see what new concepts and developments will be announced. I feel that the industry has just reached a new level of maturity and we will see a new mindset when it comes to future games.    >   But yes back to what I was saying. The new online game that is actually  Interesting. Well some of you all know that I used to be a big fan of American superhero comics. Especially those from  urlLink DC comics , like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. Even have written up some comic book characters some time ago.  So the whole concept of a online game where you can take on the role of a super hero, band together with other people who are super heroes and go against groups of dastardly villains with their army of minions and plans for world (or City) wide domination, is totally engaging to me. Sounds cheesy I know, but it fits the whole style and concept of the four-color comics. Of course, like I mentioned above, even with the best of concepts, if the execution is flawed it will not retain interest for long.  But it is in this area where developer Cryptic Studios and publisher NCsoft really shine. By constricting the game  urlLink City of Heroes  to a heavily streamlined set of features, they have captured the essence of what makes comics fun. Fast paced action, detailed and twisting story plots plus colorful and interesting environments. Believe me, in the area of online games, this is a wonderful breath of fresh air.  So anyone looking to get in on to massive online gaming, this comes highly recommended due to it's user friendliness and quick paced action. Of course, it does have a monthly payment scheme past the free trail, which is usually the main reason for the lack of popularity compared to server based online games, such as Warcraft, Counter-strike, Gunbound and the like. But this may be changing in the future, when new payment schemes are tested or even made free. I’ll be sure to keep a watch as things progress.
