So basically I don't really like bush but i really don't like Michael Moore. This guy made Farenheit 9/11 and he is a totaly jerk, essentailly he made it to get out the anti-bush vote, not to really look at the facts. Head on over to www.moorewatch.com and check out what they have to say.    Please note I am planning on going to go see this movie and will report back about what I saw.   Ok so thats it, oh i go the court date on tuesday, gonna be crazy down at city hall when D nasty gets in the defendents chair.
