Today had been quite a good day...not to mention sleeping until 4PM...haix...but it was good that I can actually eat something (Only a few would know what I mean...) and well...I feel kinda depressed so I'll just write up to here...  Farewell and take care to all that reads this...until next time...  Also thanks to "Wise Granny" Mei Fang...she is really a person who we can respect...though she seems pretty pissed of with Firli today...Mei Fang ar...relax...smile always! =)
