"goodnight, the truth has come out that everyone's needy. White teeth, a ticket to meet God and be all that you envy." - Our Lady Peace  12-11 : Oh man I feel really good right now. I was jus layin down next to Aubrey lookin @ the clouds... it was sooooooo peaceful :) I never took the time to notice before but if you look @ the clouds for a while they start to moove .. you can even feel the Earth move if you take the time to relax... good times :)  Thats pretty much it for what i have written so far. Gary thinks I'm a born writter. He's like addicted to reading it. A lot of people have told me that my writting is awesome. i don't think Ill give that up as a career choice anytime soon. But i jus gotta remember that the writting is the important thing. If i lose that ........ well..... its like when a musician gets caught up in the autographs and money and fame and all that.... and they forget that the music is the most important thing...... its kinda like that. Oh man, sitting in my room, listening to music, writtin what im feelin ......  i feel exactly how i do when Im sittin on the grass w/ my pplz @ lunch and nutrition, or during 5th period. This is such a sexy feeling..... honestly if whatever im feeling were human i would do things to it i wouldnt possibly be able to imagine.
