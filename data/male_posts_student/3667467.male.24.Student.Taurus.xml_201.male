Research for this theory has taken about five years and possibly hundreds of dollars. The theory is as follows: when it's the weekend, it's after 11 and no one knows what to do, we end up at Denny's. Sad, yes, but true. I thought the theory was only applicable in the Buffalo area, but apparently it works in the Southtowns as well. I'm almost positive it works on Transit. Anyway, after arguing in a parking lot for near half an hour, the theory kicked in like clockwork. We TRIED going to Applebee's. We TRIED going to Chili's. We TRIED looking at shows and considered hanging out at someone's house. But the Theory, man. Maybe it should be declared a Law of Nature, like gravity and the Yankees. We need more stuff to do.
