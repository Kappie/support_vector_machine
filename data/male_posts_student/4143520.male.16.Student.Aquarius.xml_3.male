But i'm a reader of  urlLink Planet Gnome  and even the Indian writers and gnome hackers are writing in english. Ok, i'm not a famous person and am not involved in a planet * thing but hey.. why not. A good chance to higher my english skills (oh, i think i made i made a mistake here).  Because I write in english I changed the blog language to English. But i don't know if i should change the timezone too. Maybe to UTC? We'll see. Right now i'm pretty happy with blogger.com. It let's me host the blog on my own FTP has nice layouts. Not like  urlLink livejournal.com.  which had pretty ugly layouts for normal users. If you use a payed account you get more and nicer themes for your blog. The only bad thing with blogger is the incompatibility with my firefox browser. Somehow i cannot make a normal link without needing to look in the HTML code and fix the . If i don't it just makes the whole sentence a link. Sucks.  But hey, now i'm using blogger.com which means i can use gnome-blog too. So i'm going to emerge it after this first post. Ah, btw. i just finished  emerge -puD world , so let's have a look what i missed while playing Doom 3 the last days.. Six packages including a new version of Firefox.  What can you except on this blog? Not much, hehe. No, really, it's just a toy and i don't think this first message will be read by more than 3 people. So, have fun and enjoy the nice looking layout.  P.S.: I got a a atom-feed! Yay! So if you want to link me: go for it :P
