Let me explain: a couple days ago I signed up for eBay to purchase a new game for X-Box. After a quick sign up, I began to bid in a frenzy and within a couple days I had 2 new video games at my doorstep, and one more in the post as we speak.  The games I won were GTA Vice City, Psi Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, and Medal of Honor II (this one doesn't count as I'll explain) and I probably spent $60 for all 3, a damn fine deal. I think that drugs, alcohol, video games and the like are expensive for a reason. Most people (myself included) are not far removed in evolution from the famous experimental monkey who would press a button that delivered stimulation to the pleasure center of his brain so much that he neglected to eat and drink and soon died. So, my wallet and my hypothalamus got together and struck a deal to betray my poor old eyes and here I am, squinting and fighting the urge to go play some more. After 7 or so hours of game playing today I am beginning to consider myself one notch lower on the Darwinian scale. Luckily, grilled cheese and homemade fruit shakes (my new favorite thing) kept me alive.  Vice City is the game that all parents groups can hold up as the example of how ridiculously violent video games have become and no one could argue. Most people have played it, or watched some poor addicted shit like me play, but for the few who haven't had the pleasure of doing a drive-by in a golf-cart I'll try to catch you up. The game is set in 80's Miami and scored with awesome New Wave and Cock Rock tracks through and through. You run around a vast city environment and do anything you want. Run over an old lady? Sure. Have sex with a prostitute in your car? You betcha! What about Ice T's favorite past-time, cop killing? Of course! And delivering pizzas? Yeah that too, but did I mention the prostitutes? Anyway, it's great fun and I have zero arguments for those who would attack me for playing such a morally reprehensible game. I am here as a receptacle for your 24 righteous indignation needs.  I started playing Psi Ops just tonight, I was scared to start it up because I didn't want to be doubly addicted. For me, it was the difference between being a pothead or a complete basehead as Jacob would say, and I've always been careful not to cross that line in my chemical abuse. So I got Barney to try it out first. Alls I can say is, damn...It's a pretty standard run and shoot type of game except that your character is imbued with psychic abilities that let him do things like lift up an enemy, hold him in mid-air and throw him into a wall repeatedly until he gives up. Or, OR....you can (with your mind) pick up a canister of gas, throw it at him and shoot it in as it approaches him. And that's just the beginning! As the game progresses you can take control of bad-guys' minds and make them walk off a building or attack their buddies, or create a wall of fire, and on and on. There is a 300lb. programmer out there somewhere who is due for a big, wet kiss on his balding head.  I fucked up on Medal of Honor and bought a copy that is only compatible with UK X-Box so I can't play it. This might be a good thing because I've lost money on it and it might help to stem my budding abuse.  I know I was supposed to write about Hartford Strippers but I can't think of that right now, I might have a seizure and shit my pants. My eyes are feeling a bit better now and it's only quarter to 11...one more game? I just need one more game....please...just to let me down easy? One more? You fucks! Ahhhhhhhhh!
