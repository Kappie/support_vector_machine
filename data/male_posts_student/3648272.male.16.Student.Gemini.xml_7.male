Danny was right when he said this thing is better than xanga. Xanga blows....except Jenny's of course (compelling stuff Jenny...compelling stuff). Anywho, lets get this blog started.  Allow myself to introduce....myself. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of meeting me, my name is Paul. I'm 16 and currently attending the  prestigious  institute of Tottenville High School. I like to workout, listen to music, hangout….you know the usual teen thing.   Anyway, thank god school is almost over. I really hate school.  Why?  Because it’s a pain in the ass. Bad teachers + useless projects + hard tests – a normal education = waste of time. That’s the formula for school. But all I really have left is the Spanish regents. So it’s almost over. I took physics the other day. Everyone thought it was REALLY HARD. Personally, I didn’t think it was that bad. It was difficult, no question bout that but it wasn’t like the massacre more commonly known as the AP bio test.  I took Global Regents today. It was alright. Not easy, not hard. I finished the multiple choice in about 20 mins. The essays took me like 2 and a half hours. They weren’t bad. I thought the essays were a lot easier than the multiple choice, just really really really loooooooong. Next Tuesday is the Spanish regents. I’m not worried. I really didn’t study that much for global and probably not going to study for Spanish either. Oh well.   Anyway that was my day. I’m really tired now, so maybe I’ll take a nap and then when I wake up I’ll probably go to the gym. God I haven’t been at the gym for like 2 weeks all ready! Friggin school. Friggin finals…which I didn’t study for. Friggin projects which I lose every time my computer crashes. Oh well, but that’s all over. Anyway, this is the end of this post. I wish it could have been more interesting. Till next time.
