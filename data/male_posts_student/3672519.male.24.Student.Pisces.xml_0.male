You know with painful accuracy the provenance of everything you touched and the last time you touched it. The five little cushions on your sofa stay plumped and leaning at their jaunty angle for months at a time unless you theatrically muss them. The level of the salt in your shaker decreases at the same excruciating rate, day after day. Sitting in Sheba's house - studying the mingled detritus of its several inhabitants - I could see what a relief it might be to let your own meagre effects be joined with other people's."   - Zoe Heller, Notes On A Scandal
