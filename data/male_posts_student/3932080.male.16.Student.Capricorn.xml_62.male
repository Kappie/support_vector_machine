Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink So Sexy -Twista feat. R. Kelly  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #28  This year hasn’t seen a more awkward summer jam than  Twista’s  “So Sexy,” the third release from his career-making sophomore effort,  Kamikaze . Produced by  R. Kelly , the track meshes cool, juicy keyboards with cellular wriggles to back the unlikely duo in their seaside scoping. Unfortunately, the song quickly simmers into the result of censoring, PG-rating, and laziness;  Kelly , the man who once wanted to stick his key in our ignition, walks wounded from his past age-limit problem like it’s a “you must be this tall to ride me” sign. Churning out a boring beach bash that at its most ambitious claims  Twista  to be “so sexy,” R. seems at a loss for hotness, sensuality, and (his personal favorite) raunchiness. Worst of all, he’s paired with hip hop’s motor-mouth, who, despite the laidback beat, raps like his ass is on fire. Let’s face it: An  R. Kelly -produced single is no single at all if it doesn’t encourage raw, unprotected sex, and “So Sexy” won’t cause any rise in home pregnancy testing.    The Verdict:  4.8/10 - Brouhaha   (2.4/5)
