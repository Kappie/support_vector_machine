I started working at the bank on Wednesday, the day after we gave a presentation about our report in this course called strategy... I think I've told every one that I we had this golf club and were trying to improve the service.  The job is ok Im one of two guys in 17 people department which is ok. It will get rather boring coz I just putting numbers on a computer but hopefully I can get something better next summer.  Funny thing the school had like a final party and we drove a little bit out of the city and to this, Id call community centre after a few beers I thought it would be a good idea to check out the pool but had to climb over this fence which was in the way. Long story short I look like Rudolf the rednose... My nose is red, my upper lip, chin on two places (how I did hurt both (under) chin and the nose at the same time is beyond me) and finally both my hands. It´ll be rather embarrassing to go to work on tomorrow looking like I was in the fight of my life.... You should have seen the other guy ;)  Today and yesterday I've been watching The Office and its just so funny. Sometimes its so embarrassing I just cant look. Think the American version will be a flop though.  Later, Úlli
