I'm going to have to get up early if I want to have everybody here by 11. Nine is way too early.  I've got all the details I'm going to work out for scene one worked out, and the filming should go smoothly tomorrow. Like a well tuned rocket, I say. We probably won't get all of Scene 1 done. Hell, I doubt if we'll get most of it done. The main purpose of this session is just to get everybody acquainted with DCME and the movie process. We haven't done anything like it yet, so this should be a little tough getting everything going.  I'll do a short writeup on how tomorrow goes after it's all said and done.
