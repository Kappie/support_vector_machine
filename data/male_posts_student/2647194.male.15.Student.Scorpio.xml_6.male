So that made me feel like I didn't really deserve the weekend. Wait a minute, do I ever deserve it? I mean, its not like I have a nightlife on the weekends. Saturday night: sitting at home watching SNL. Friday night: robotics. How interesting.  Well, the long weekend is here, and I still don't have anything really fun planned. Yay-and then there's that English project...which brings me to this:  Evil English project progress: completely done with the three newspaper articles. One out of seven parts, which leaves 6 do to.  As for that bio test-it required next to no studying, which was excedingly great. Social was different. *Last minute cram in study hall* Best moment of Friday: changing a random person's background on the computer to...uh...can't say. My idea too...good times.  Arg-its now 12:36, and I'm literally shivering because my room is so [censored] cold. Combine that with being tired, and having to get up at 9:00 AM, and its not fun. So I'm outta here.  Remember, *Sleep is good*  Bren
