Received a call from my school chinese teacher and she asked me to take the test on thursday. HAi!!! Boring!!! Got to be in sch early. Anyway, dun think i m going for cross country, r u(chris). But i m still going to darren's house. Btw, chelsea juz spent another 20 million pounds on another useless player. Wat can i say... All the best for my chinese test.
