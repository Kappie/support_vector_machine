What is this supposed to mean? I could do this! It's trash!  Anyone could do this.   "Klein rejected the idea of representation or personal expression in painting, and became obsessed with immaterial values, beyond the visible or tactile. He began making monochrome paintings in 1947 as a way of attaining total freedom. A decade later, he developed his trademark, patented colour, International Klein Blue (IKB). He executed a series of paintings using IKB, as well as sculptures made from objects such as sponges dipped in the colour."    IT'S STILL JUST A CANVAS COLORED IN "SPECIAL" BLUE PAINT!     I am always doing that which I can not do, in order that I may learn how to do it.   (Pablo Picasso)
