I'm going to get my cell phone repaired (courtesy of Bell Mobility), do like 4 loads of laundry (I'm almost completely out of clothes) clean my room and then head back to the house that I am house sitting. Don't know why, I just feel motivated to do stuff rather than sit around and read, or play video games.  Tomorrow is federal election day here in Canada. I plan on voting conservative of course. I was thinking about this recently and realized how odd it is that an extremely artsy person like me, who is so in to personal freedom and epotimizes a new generation of thinking in so many ways is only comfortable with traditional Judeo-Christian family valess (like those represented by our federal conservatives). Meh. Who knows.  Anyways, off to take in the world in a series of small chores and need-to-do errands. With any luck I will find bundles of cash on the street somewhere, and no longer be poor. *laugh*  Shalom.
