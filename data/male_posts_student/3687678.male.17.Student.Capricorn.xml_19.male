    
        I am finally back and better than ever! With a new version of Blogger out, and no more work in sight, I should be able to now blog with ease.        Dusty's Word is a daily newsletter, that is, a daily guide to the internet. With the advent of blogging on the internet, it has become easier to share information whether it be news, opinions, links, and more through a blogging system. Hopefully this newsletter will both inspire and keep you informed.        Users are encouraged to share comments about different posts. If you have other suggestions either about the blog or something we suggest, feel free to post it.        There is no longer a set schedule of postings (EX. Monday tech news, Wednesday downloads, etc.). So please come back every day 'cause you'll never know what you may find. And another thing, this site is safe for kids, but if you see anything that is inappropriate, let  urlLink Dusty  know.
