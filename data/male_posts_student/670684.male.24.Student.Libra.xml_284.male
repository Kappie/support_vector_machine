I stood in the Sprint PCS store in the Arboretum, quietly pondering my options.  In my left hand, Old Faithful...a dilapadated black Samsung phone with flip mouthpiece, saying Holla Moe to me, set off by beautiful indiglo background.  In my right hand, the Qualcomm CDM9155SP, a run-of-the-mill phone...no flip top, nothing special except a few funny rings that I never plan to use.  The new phone was $20, much cheaper than anything they displayed on the floor.  Admana, the sales representative assisting me, told me it was a special markdown from $100...I would believe that were it not for Luisa yesterday telling me it was the cheap phone they gave to schmucks who didn't want to pay big money.  I'm a schmuck.  And I saved $80 by being one.    I'll grow to love this phone though.  I can't hold my attachment to uniqueness against it...it was what I needed at the time.  We'll have adventures.    Years ago, Corey McMullin gave me some sort of rubber toy that looked of Pokemon.  I put it in my backpack and never thought of it again, except on the odd occasion where I could not find a pencil and dumped the contents out, finding this small purple dragon looking up at me, a demented smile on its face.  I figured I should throw it away...I wasn't using it.  But somehow, I was attached.  In April, sitting with Brian Thomas in Texadelphia, I decided it was time to give the little guy a new life of its own.  I put him on top of a napkin bearing the inscription WANTED:  A NEW ADVENTURE.  HAVE SEEN NEW YORK, WASHINGTON, MIAMI, SAN DIEGO, CHICAGO, MONTREAL, AND NASSAU.  WHERE WILL YOU TAKE ME?  I hope he writes.    Car is being stupid.  Something loose with the connection to the battery.  At least I hope...fix-it guru Daniel Harr gave me instructions on how to fix it, but I was unable, somewhat out of idiocy, though I tried several things he mentioned.  We'll get it jumped and see what the dealership says tomorrow.    Full Metal Jacket tonight while eating not the greatest catfish stir-fry (without a car, tough to get to market to buy rice).  Nearly cried for the first time in a movie when they beat Vincent D'Onofrio with the soap.  Holy Fucking Shit.  And I expect to make films like that?  I really wonder how someone can be satisfied with writing mindless shit after watching movies like that.
