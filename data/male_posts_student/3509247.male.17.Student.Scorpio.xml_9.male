They have a cafe and a player piano in there.  I'm sorry, I can't hook anyone up with free food.  Anyways, here goes.  Obviously working in Broad Ripple I run into some of the strangest people.  I had this one goth guy come into work and he was talking really weird.  He was speaking incredibly intelligently, but his voice sounded nothing like one that had the tongues of a braniac.  He was like, "Hey brother; can I get two ice waters?  Hydration is essential on a day like today."  I wanted to laugh so hard, but I kept it in.  The head supervisor over the store is soooo goofy.  He's a nice guy, but he's got a gooberish sense of humor.  His name is Rob and he is married.  He says some goofy things from time to time, so I'll put them on here when I remember them.  I know today (Tuesday) I had an average serve time of 40 seconds.  I asked Rob if that was good and he was like, "Yeah, that's not bad."  That's not too goofy, but I guess you'd have to have been there.  I'm still getting faster and faster at what I do; so it cuases some tension every now and then.  Especially when I have customers like this one lady.  Ok, she didnt' know what she wanted, but all she had was change.  And then when she finally decided what she thought she wanted she changed it and had to recount the change.  Ugh!  Then you of course have the snotty customer that gets mad if you check to make sure you've got the order right, or their just mad because they're mad.  Idk, I've had a couple of people like that.  This one kid came up to me and was like, "Do strawberries regularly (I can't pronounce that word by the way) come with a chocolate shake cause I had quite a few in mine."  I felt like saying, "No, only the special customers get them."  Or going back to ask if they did just to make the kid look stupid, but I just gave him another shake and left it alone.  I work with some cool people so from time to time, I'll bring them up.  Like Sophia, who works back in drive through, is pretty cool, but she'll cuss customers out when she doesn't have the microphone on.  I wish I didn't think this, but I sounds so funny the way she does it.  Of course I don't approve of it, but sometimes I feel like laughing so hard.  Anyways, I've had a tough day at work today, so I'll just close off with my devotional verses and what I got from them.  Proverbs 4:5,7 say "Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.  Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting, get understanding."  Those verses pointed out to me that I needed to seek wisdom out principally.  The other things fall in line so much easier if you simply apply the things you learn from God's word.  Wealth, satisfaction, friendships all seem easer when you approach them in God's way.  Then in Galatians 4:29-30, God's word says, "But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even it is now.  Nevertheless, what saith the scriptures?  Cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoam shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman."  That meant quite a bit to me.  First of all, it's an allegory for the story of Haggar (called Aggar in this passage.  Something with the translation change I guess) and Abraham.  You all know the story, I think.  Abraham was promised a child (Isaac through Sarah) but he wanted it his own way (Ishmael through Hagar).  Ishmael tormented Isaac for whatever reason.  Because of this Abraham cast out Hagar and Ishmael.  I thought it was wrather interesting the allegory he used in this passage because he didn't just cast out the antagonist (sin).  He also cast out the cause of his antagonism (sin's root or sin's cause if you will).  I think the fact that it was an allegory using humans kinda showed me something that I didn't and still don't want to see.  Of course if I don't go with what the Bible says (like it says in Proverbs) there will be no "ornament of grace" about my neck.  That grace spoke to me because, if you guys know me very well, I like to be smooth, gracefull, refined, well-mannered.  Not abiding by that wisdom takes the sauvity out of my life which stresses me out.  Because of this I made a choice tonight that may change quite a bit.  Colleen may not have been mad at me, but she sure is now.  I've been extremely busy so I haven't been able to talk to her as much as I would like.  I've been stressed so I thought applying this verse would give me back some suavity.  Colleen will play mind games from time to time almost daring the person to say something bad about her.  For example (not an actual occurence) she'd say "I'm so ugly."  Of course she's not, but it's almost as if she's daring you to say that she is.  In a more practical version of something that happened, she said something bad about herself that was true, and I decided to tell her the truth (at least as I saw it) and she didn't like that (who would).  I'm not supposed to lie to make her feel better, so I told her the truth (as I saw it) and now I know for a fact she's angrier than a hive of wasps after being teased.  Now obviously if she wanted me to lie to make her feel better, or if she wanted my perspective to be one that was not true, she'd be hagar (the one presenting the trouble to me).  I don't want to push her away because I value her too much, but if she's going to behave this way, I don't have much choice.  Please post comments to help me with this situation.  Anyway, I'm tired so, this is the man with the not really very good plan,  Joshua Guynn  P.S.  Thank you once again Jeremiah for teaching me some of the basics of HTML.  Because of you, I was able to add my friend Ashley Broscoe onto my list.  Thanks once agian.
