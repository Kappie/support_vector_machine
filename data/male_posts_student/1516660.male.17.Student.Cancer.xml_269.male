I ate the what ar, fishball noodles. We brought 8-Days then I walked around, while reading that mag, Shop And Save trailing my mother while she records price changes. One idiotic old lady poked me in my back, and gestured rudely that I am blocking her path. EXCUSE ME! THERE ARE POLITER WAYS TO TELL SOMEONE TO MOVE! I glared at her when I made way. Idiot. After that, we went to the market to buy some ingredients for steamboat (reunion dinner). Okay, we did not. We almost brought prawns, but we forgot. Tomorrow buy lor. Mother brought some big pieces of ginger, saying that such big pieces are hard to come by. The world can do without ginger.  I came back, went online. Oh,. Kinokuniya called me while I was away. I had a feeling they would call this morning, but I didn't bring my phone. i shoulda listened to my instinct. They said the book I wanted, New Clues to Harry Potter Book 5, came. YaY! I yesterday placed an online order on two books, the New Clues and The Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter. I am anxiously waiting for the online receipt to come, so I can collect it. Me and manda chatted. I encouraged her to join Singapore Idol. Wendy and SuPing also. They got great voices man! I would like to see them join, and win! :D They have the ability to lor. Yep!  YaY! The email order came in! I immediately rushed to Kinokuniya to get it. Yay!! These books are about exposing hints/clues in the Harry Potter series. The first one tells us the hints already revealed. The second book in the series (Book 5 Clues) makes the readers think for themselves. How smart of the author. I came home at 1.30+.  I ate my lunch (nasi lemak) while reading the first book. Woah! The book really broaden the HP world. I can see very clearly that JK had already hidden clues for what's coming in the later books (even up to book 5. This shows that she already had all of it planned. HaHa!) in the first book. I never noticed these clues until they were pointed out. How wodnerous! I began to appreciate the HP series more and more. It's a series full of mysteries, suspense right till the end. :) What a fun clues-unravelling book!  Hmm...after a few chapters and lunch, I went online lor. Play Gunbound, chat...then onto dinner. After dinner, came back, bathed and watched TV. The new series is nice. I like the character ShuiXi. Yes Yes. I read a few chapters too. Okay, after that, I came online and here I am, blogging.  I think hor, only after CNY then I would start looking for a job. Yeah...I lazy la. HaHa. Moo meow meow! I am so excited about buying ingredients for reunion dinner! HaHa! We must buy  hams  (calm-like thingys...forgot the English word for it) early!! Once, we didn't get to eat  hams  because we were too late. They got sold out at CNY Eve!! We must buy at least 2 days before CNY Eve. That's Monday. I will make sure Mother buys then. Or should we buy tomorrow? The sooner, the better. I see  hams'  stock today in the market, and they were quite few lor!! They were being snapped up!! Oh god! I must eat  hams  during steamboat! I cannot do without them!! No no no!!  Okay. Enough worrying. Tomorrow decide hor. Okay. I going le. Today's Charmed Episode is the one of the season! Must watch ar!! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
