Although it may seem to have more readers I assure you that most of u will be disapointed by this site and I advice that noone who wishes to keep their full intelligence from going. (no offence Alex nothing personal) The dark on dark is extrememly hard to read and text is boring and uninteresting. but anyway WELCOME THE THE BLOGGING COMMUNITY ALEX. may your site last a long time and u have gained your first troll. :-P   ps look up troll at  urlLink dictionary.org
