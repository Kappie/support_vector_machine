We have a 7 month old baby girl named Breanna.  urlLink    Breanna  urlLink     She's quite a handful. I have been developing a website for about a month now. It's a personal website that has a little bit of everything added to it. So that it doesn't plainly look like a blog site even though I'll blog on it. I have found a server to host it for Â£*** As at now, I am only spending about an hour a day, 3 days a week on the development of the site. I know I need to put in more time if I want to launch it earlier, but the problem is that I ain't got no time. You will get to know me better when its launched sometime next month (hope so). This is how my homepage will look like. or more like it.
