Film Class:  Finished filming some pickup shots and others we forgot, or atleast that we had   imagined   that we shot.     Lunch:  Rode bikes with Goldy to the church sale and picked up a single shoulder backpack for 2 bucks. It's the greatest.      After Class:  Rode to the train station with Goldy, and saw Emily, Kate and Logan, and it was awkward for some reason. Or maybe it was awkward before I got there, I don't know.     After Awkward:  Talked to Zack about Stalker, and showed him my cool new bag. I also figured out how to use it in conjunction with my iPod's remote. Now I can ride and change the song / play-pause / change the volume, it's really nifty.       Dinner:  Promised to let my mom borrow my iPod for her trip to Italy. I have no idea what I'm going to do without it. What a mistake.    Goodnight.
