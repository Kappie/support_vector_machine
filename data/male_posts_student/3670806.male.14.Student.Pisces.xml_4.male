I do not believe in political correctness, and I try to go in the exact opposite direction of it, as a way of fighting back. So, if you see me making some heated rant about something absolutely ridiculous, or you see one too many "fuck"s on this blog, just keep that in mind. Sorry if I offend anyone, but noone's forcing you to read this. And frankly, if you have a serious objection to "dirty words", I just can't really understand. I'm sorry, but in my view, they're just words, that I use to express my opinion. I am not offended by these words, I have no objection to using them. Again, I'm sorry if I'm offensive, but that's just the way things are, please keep the above in mind.  Thanks, Henry
