Well my cousin is 13 years old and he is so kool, mean and kiddish, lol, wich is the part of him i love more. its not like im in love with him but we were lving together for so much long so we kinda got used to each other and when it was time for him to leave with his mom i wanted to die lol. not really but he is the person i care the most in my family, i'd never let anything happen to him. well so u be asking "how would that kid look like" huh? well go to www.freewebs.com/y2kut/pics.html and go to the very end of the page to see a pic of him i got three of him. he is a lil cutie and he is very sweet.  ok enough of that lol. now... dont u think that b letting u know everything that happens in my life im giving u too much info? lol well i dont mind that but at least would u consider voting for my blog at rankmyblog.studentcenter.org? you just have to click the button on the right and vote. ok so see ya all byez.
