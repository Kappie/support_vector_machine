I find him both similar and dissimilar from myself. He is...was a weird man, had a quasi-introverted social life, and read a lot. So far similar. Our differences exist in religion or as his case, the lack thereof. He was a mechanical materialist which is just about as far from Christianity as you can get. He disbelieved in anything spiritual or supernatural...at all. This is especially timely since the other book I'm reading, Miracles by C.S. Lewis, tells quite a different tale. I find Lewis a tad more persuasive, but I am quite biased. Today I will not explain my reasons for spirituality. Maybe next time, when they are challenged by a greater, less dead opponent.
