Haven't really updated in ages eh? Yeah. I really haven't felt that motivated to post. Lordy. I made brownies again. The whole irony was that my Brownie flopped and became a cake, and the popular myth was that the brownie is essentially a cake that flopped. I feel like pouring my soul out, but, it's just too hard. Everyone I know reads this blog. This is why it is going to die. I think I might be into the Strokes now... Franz Ferdinand is fairly addictive. That's all. Maybe some more later.
