I used to keep a diary when I was young but I lost the interest of holding a pen later on.. I have scary past and backgrounds which no one wants to go through.. Neither do I wish to see it happen again !! Blogging seems different from writing in a diary.. It seeeeeeems like my secrets are no longer needed to hide..
