And when I earn a thousand, I'd want to earn $4000. But when I earn $4000, though I might have said that I'd be contented with it whilst I was earning $400, I'd still want more. Life's a natural chase whether you like it or not and we're stuck playing the game.  It works the same for various facets of our lives dear reader, be it financial accumulation, points of authority, website hit-counter statistics, material possession or even trivial popularity... why then do we (on a sub-related note) look the gift horse in the mouth?  I am unhappy with the way I was today. The way I still am. TV and Computer... Not good. Have terms coming, haven't started preparing and have a tonne of homework to do. Oh man... I know it's only the start of the holidays, but time's a wastin and I fear I may not have enough time.  Ok, it's getting dry and pointless, or at least, that's the way I feel now. Am only looking forward to Saturday. Going over to Foong's bar to get totally TOTALLY wasted. Apparently the dude's got enough juice to send a rocket toooo the mmmooooonnnn. Will bring camera. Will also be exacting vengeance on the bastard face who ran over Ken's dog...  Haha... Booze and jam all night long. What else could I ask for but her? Will make my debut mark on the "wall of want" too. How we're goin to go to church the next day, I don't know... but what the heck lah... "IRONY SCREAMING IS!!!" (drunk Yoda talk).  Till next time boys and girls. Same time, same channel.
