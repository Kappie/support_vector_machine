So i decided in my boredom state that i am in right now to type up a user account and specify what my thoughts are this very damn second.  HOLY SHIT BACON IS THE BEST THING SINCE MY GMAS PANCAKES! This is very good bacon so crisp and I'm in here eating bacon listening to crystal method.  I just got back from my good friend Jon's house and my other good friend shane was over there too.  We went outside for a bit but it seems that we shouldn't have gone outside because while we were outsidex3 it seems we had ppl getting on to our accounts and my other good friend talor's account and fucking around with a good friend chelsey.  Now all the good friends are connected and friends also together, worded that right ;) who gives a shit.. but anyways chelsey did not have a good night and neither did we, we got blamed like most americans would, but hell if i was in chelseys shoes i would blame us too, because this person who we think we know who was fucking around with ppl acted like us.  Acted like me, me being the retarded, fag, stupid low-life with no love life, spending my time at the computer and reading bombs and playing counterstrike, what a life, not talking on msn as much and blah blah blah fuck me sideways im gay.  Um ya, we came back inside and no one was at the computer but ppl were all pissed at us, yes it started at one person and i think it spreaded like gonerrhea to other ppl, god damn STD that is why u fuck only ppl u know who dont have stds u dumbasses.  So my good friend shane talked things out and it seems they dont hate us anymore, which is what it should've been anyways, we didn't do anything so...  ya..   New paragraph.  The incoming freshmen into Joplin High School should be better than what it was last year, since i was a freshmen last year, my year of ppl suck balls.  They are annoying, stuck up pricks, that should be melted in shit.  I hate them.  Not all but most, and the upper classmen r the same way.  But hell it is all good in the hood, LOL no... and maybe sarah does hate certain koreans.  I get my hair cut today half and inch just to make it even, its like sprints it curls when it gets to a certain point.  We must be related sprint..donedonedone, cry sprint. no seriously cry... bastard..im giong to go im talking of pointless stuff because life is pointless at some points like this time frame of day that i am in.. later
