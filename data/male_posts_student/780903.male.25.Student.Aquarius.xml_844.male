[video clip of woman churning butter]  Cameron Diaz: I'm so glad we don't have to churn butter now.  Sharon Osbourne: Churning butter!  Imagine if we had to churn butter!  Mo Rocca: I churned butter once for a segment on The Daily Show, and it was not fun.  Hal Sparks: I think that woman churning butter is more famous than I am.  I used to host a show on E! and now I'm on a show on Showtime.  At this rate in six months I'll be hosting a show on Animal Planet and giving commentary on the Oxygen network about what life would be like if I was a woman.  Sharon Osbourne: He got too much airtime!  No fair!  Watch the Osbournes!  [video clip of a man on the toilet]  David Cassidy: There was no toilet paper in the 1820s  Lionel Richie: Has my career really sunk this low?  Sharon Osbourne: No toilet paper!  Ha!  There was no toilet paper!  Watch my talk show!  Mo Rocca: Your talk show just got canceled.  Sharon Osbourne: Cancelled!  And no toilet paper?  Alec Baldwin: It would have been hard to live in a time when there was no toilet paper.  I don't know what I would have done.  Stephen Baldwin: I don't know either.  Alec Baldwin: Why are you on this show?  I'm more famous than you?  You're just famous because you're my brother.  Lisa Marie Presley: And I'm just famous because my father may or may not be dead.  Toilet paper!  Sharon Osbourne: Toilet paper!  [video of slaves doing slavery stuff]  Sharon Osbourne: Slavery!  Lionel Richie: I need a new manager.  Alec Baldwin: I do too.  [video of President Andrew Jackson kicking some Indians]  Cameron Diaz: I think President Andrew Jackson is so cute.  Sharon Osbourne: President Andrew Jackson!  Is so cute!  Bob Barker: I remember when he was just a little kid.  Lionel Richie: You need a new manager.  Bob Barker: I know.  But I've spent all my Price Is Right earnings on booze and hookers.  Danny Bonaduce: Did someone say booze and hookers?  [video of pilgrims playing tennis]  Rich Eisen, SportsCenter: Tennis was big in the 1820s.  Can I get my check now?  Sharon Osbourne: Look at those rackets they're using!  Nick Lachey: My wife is dumb.  Sharon Osbourne: Tennis!  Cameron Diaz: Tennis is so cute!  Drew Barrymore: I remember when I used to play tennis.  Bob Barker: I've been neutered.  Sharon Osbourne: Neutered!  Watch the Osbournes!
