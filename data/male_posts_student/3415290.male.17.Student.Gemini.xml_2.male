Could it happen today, or tomorrow? All of these questions I also personally held as of a few years ago. However study and teaching have helped narrow these questions and bring some distinction to all of these unknown possibilities. In the following text that you will read below, I will not try to venture out into the analysis and translation of Revelation. Nor, will I try and tell you any of the specifics that will happen when the end comes. This text will be solely dedicated to what we, as Christians, must do now and to what must happen here on earth before the end can come.   As a young Christian boy, I grew up going to Sunday school every week being taught about the very simple and elementary truths of the bible and of God.  Many of these teachings were true. But some of them were made out of misunderstandings of the Bible, particularly one. This is the same teaching held also by a large majority of the Christian population. You may even hold this thought yourself. It is this belief: Jesus could come back any second and we must live our lives as though he is coming back tomorrow! This concept however, is untrue and unbiblical. No where in the bible can you find any basis for this idea. However, many of the verses used to teach this belief are taken out of context and are read out of great misunderstandings.   I first will begin my belief with this statement: Jesus Christ cannot return now.  You may be shocked with disagreement or fantasized with puzzlement, but I beg you either way to hear me out. Let’s look at Matthew 24:14, “And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.” In this verse, the translated word “nations” is the word “ethnos” in the original Greek. This word “ethnos” comes from the same Latin derivative that our English word “ethnic” comes from. So the Greek word “ethnos” is properly translated as an “ethnic group”. A common supplementary name for these “ethnic groups” is “people groups”. Right now, there are approximately 12,864 “people groups” in the world. Among those 12,864 people groups, 6,322 have not been reached for Christ. Now according to the previously stated verse, the “gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations (all people groups), and then the end will come.” God is Sovereign and mighty in all ways; never changing. People may ask this question, “If God is Sovereign, can’t he just do what he wants?” The answer is definitely yes. However, when God makes a law, He cannot break that law. It completely goes against His nature. He is the same yesterday, today, and for the rest of eternity. He made this declaration/law with His own mouth. He spoke forth this one mandate as to what must happen before he returns.   “What about us?” You might be asking.  “What can or should we do in the mean time?” Well, the best part about this truth is that it is not a hopeless cause; reaching the rest of these 6,322 people groups is not impossible! In fact, it is possible that the closure of the great commission IS possible in OUR LIFETIME! There are approximately 900 church congregations to every 1 “unreached people group” still left in the world. If we, as a generation, begin to unite in strategic development planning for the reaching of these 6,000+ “unreached people groups”, a mighty revival of God would spread like wild fire through the earth in greater proportions than ever seen before. The mobilization of missions has never been greater than the time we live in now!   My hope in writing this text is that it will further your passion for reaching the many “unreached people groups” in the world.  I do not wish that you sit back and say, “Oh, Jesus isn’t coming back anytime soon. I can just sit back and relax until it gets closer . . . then I’ll get serious.” By no means! Nor do I want you, the reader, to feel overwhelmed with the vastness of the task that is before all of us. I merely want to you remember that: the task is before all of us. Each of us must do our part in the reaching out to lost and unreached world. For the end goal of the closure of the Great Commission! I want to encourage you; take that first step into the unknown. You may not know exactly what God wants you do to reach those who are unreached, but start walking. We, as Christians, must ready this earth for Jesus’ return. Each day, each minute, each second must be solely focused on spreading His renown; so that all the earth can know, and then the end will come!
