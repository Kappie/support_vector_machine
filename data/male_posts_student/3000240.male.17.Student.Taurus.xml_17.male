Happy as I am now, and as inappropriate as it is to post this on a public site, it shivers me to remember what my mental state was like a mere 8 months ago. Imagine what it is like to walk into a room and fall victim to the unrepentant and systematic torment that is the locusts of your class "mates"; and just maybe you could see a glimmer of what my life was like. You hasten and begin to think that the people you inhabit school are the archetype of humanity, forgetting the fresh breeze of multicultural, such is the rigor and stiffness of the regime and people, that is Halliford.  I was young in every sense of the word there. Maybe I was never naturally inclined to be a private school boy, or maybe I'm just stubborn I'm never quite sure, but I hated the 6 years I spent in the abyss there. I have my limits, and I'm not going to ever tell too much information about my implosion into excrement within the dying embers of my time there, however if you would like a clue: I trusted people I shouldn't, and provoked flames in people who had been looking for the excuse against me for years. I can't say I'm completely fault-ridden I've done some and made some God awful catastrophe's, but even in my mind, what I went through was largely unjust. I've learnt not to dwell on the past, but I'll never relieve myself of the bitter taste that pollutes my saliva whenever the thoughts of them come to mind.  I came very close to ending it all. Maybe none of you realise it and never will, but luck, my nephews envisaged crying face, and the bottom of my mental stability saved me. Standing on top of the block of flats near the precinct, thinking jump and realising that it can't get lower than being on top of here where so many other people have jumped from in the past.  I built a fortress and I became rather bedridden the preceding summer, but at least there was a genuine look at short term hope. I went to Esher and the rest is history. It's not worth saying any more, I just get resentful and bitter at everything. The whole thing taught me that you have to be happy through life and keep your head up whatever your going through there is always the horrible cliche of light at the end of the tunnel.  xBuBzx
