Second, we couldn't get the computers networked.  How convient?  Chase was running XP, Brett on 98 and me on 2000.  Three different operating systems.  Chase fired up his computer and messed with the bios and fried his stuff.  He couldn't use his computer for the rest of the night.  To this point, it still doesn't work.  Brett got his working, but we had to share the internet connection.  We'd yell at each other to get some time and we'd switch off every now and then.  It turned out horrible.  We bought pizza, chips, soda the whole 9-yards but nothing turned out right.  I suppose I should have planned ahead and maybe learned a bit or two about networking.  Karl was supposed to come.  He took LAN class, so he could probably have hooked it up.  He didn't show.  What's even better is that he quit our clan, C/A.  He joined another and basically abandoned us.  He claimed he'd still help us but I doubt that.  Meanwhile, Brendon is taking over for Wags(Karl).  We'll just see how that goes.  I have confidence in Brendon.  He's the guy who's setting up our T1 server, so not much to be said.  So pretty much last night went pretty crappy for me.  :-(  This morning though, I got Brett's and my computer hooked up.  Found out that I forgot about @Home and MediaCom switch.  I put '@Home' as the network group instead of the MediaCom one.  I'm glad I figured it out now.  Hopefully we'll get to play some games before the guys go home.  That's about it.
