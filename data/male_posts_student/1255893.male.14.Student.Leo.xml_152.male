I'm jus sooooo sorry that i killed our chances of ever being friends. got caught up in the moment i guess. Still though, i was out of line and i hope you can accept my apology. Though i doubt that'll help make up for any damage ive caused... i guess its a start right? Fuck though... id put this in your comments but they dont work. and the chatterbox wont let me put everything i want. Jus one thing though.... don't be mad at ave or feel hurt by her in any way. jus let it be clear that she did NOTHING.   on to more pleasant matters, i jus finished readind my vacation book. it was soooooooooooo awesome. and no stanley, its not just the sex. id explain it, but summaries never do justice to the actual reading.   what else? umm..... nuthin really. jus had to take some crap off my back, or chest..... wtvr. same thing. and i couldnt let it end on a shadowed tone. anywho my wuv to all and ill post again soon
