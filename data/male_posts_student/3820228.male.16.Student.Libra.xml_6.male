Well, I'm not sure if I know how to give that one but I was wondering if I did when he followed me into the hot tub. Then I got to thinking how BAD that would be if my dad walked over to check up on me if I started doing any kind of flirting. Ugh, not only that but I have a boyfrind back in michigan who loves me! I don't know what to do with these young hormones of mine sometimes. I love Bill too though and I wouldn't do anything anyways. But, sure enough, my dad came stollin' in! Ehh, it's alright!
