Unfortunately, since she wasn't feeling well, my family didn't go to Toronto today, and instead I'm going to some wedding on the 24th. Meh, Toronto's Toronto, so I REALLY don't mind for what occasion I'm out in the T-dot for. So yeah...spent most of the day at home.  Today didn't TOTALLY go to waste though. First thing in the morning my family had a Saturday Brunch BBQ of some sort, with me and my dad making waffles for dessert. It was my first time doing that, so yeah I know how to make waffles now =). Even though it wasn't exactly AMAZING tasting, meh, first time so give me a break =P. I'll make them better next time hopefully...  Afterwards my parents went out shopping at Bellemere, and I drummed for the next hour and a half. Afterwards sat on MSN, then drummed for another hour. I've actually improved with fills and stuff now, as before I always choked whenever the pattern ended with my right hand. I'm beginning to smoothen things out though, and the new layout for my kit I find it is a lot easier. Having the ride cymbal on the right side instead of the middle is MUCH better. Oh yeah, and I REALLY need new drumheads, I'm going to be breaking my other tom any day now. So whenever I find 100 bucks to spare, I'm just going to refit my whole kit.  Anyways afterwards, parents came back, then went to Tai Hu for dinner tonight. Wasn't that bad I guess, I haven't been to the place in ages.  Afterwards we came home *obviously.* I decided to read PDL and the Bible for a bit. Read Matthew 18, about how to treat fellow Christians, and why we should be solving problems with our fellow Christians if a problem arises rather than shoveling more coal into the fire. It also reminded me of how God's presence is always with us in verse 20. I'm onto Purpose 3 in PDL now I think, er the small version of PDL, which is almost like a small version of a Bible haha.  That basically wraps up my day. Just chattin' right now and eating blueberries and strawberries. Veggies and Fruits have come to be compy snacks, and tea is the official drink of Joe when he is being a geek on the computer.  Anyways I'm out for tonight. Gavin and Josh are comin' over to jam after church tomorrow, so yeah no afternoon nap haha.  Later.
