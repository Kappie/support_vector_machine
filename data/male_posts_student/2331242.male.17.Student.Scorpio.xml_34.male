I've always been "the good boy," but over the last few days, that hasn't been the case. All those years, spent maturing and growing, culminated today. I found a release, but now I feel guilty. There's nothing quite like the sensation of guilt... especially when your brain tolerates it but your heart does not. Fucking hormones. This is not the JD everyone knows... WTF... my mind is breaking into pieces... I'm confused.... I need to talk to Martha so I can clear my mind...  I'm just going to leave it at that.  Confused as hell, JD
