I just wanted to be alone, and I am sorry for that.  I kind of felt like Shrek, but now that I have seen the movie, I realize that love comes to even ogers and it will come to me one day. I apoligize if I was mean, but i didn't feel too happy at the time.  But do not fear for Pussy in Boots is here!  Lol.  Now I am feeling a lot better, and I am ready to finish out the school year!!  I really hope i can have some sort of a get together, as an end of the year celebration.  I'm so happy, b/c i was invited to a party! (In the words of lindsay- WOOT! lol)   Anyways.......... It is kinda late for a school night, (not really, but my mom is making me go to bed, lol) so i will post more tomorrow.  Please show me that you are out there, and that you care by commenting!  Later  Eric "The Tuba Man" Morrison
