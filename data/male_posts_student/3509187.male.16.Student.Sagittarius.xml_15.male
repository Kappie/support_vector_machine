Saturday morning I'm going to be leaving for a canoe trip and won't be home until sunday afternoon, so try not to miss me to much. Its about 10:30 am rightnow and my brain is not quite alive. Last night, or I guess this morning, I watched Jason X... 2 am to 4 am, it was pretty much the biggest waist of time ever. I have In-Car again today so I'll be leaving about 11:45 today for town.  I'm hoping to have at least my Music Mart cover letter and application done by then...so... I'll end this now and get to work on that...  Until later when maybe I'm awake and not so lazy...  -Dan V
