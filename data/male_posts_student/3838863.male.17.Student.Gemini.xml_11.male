Hope it made a difference in their lives. Go Jesus~   J ustify me.  E nough of myself.  S ick of barrenness.  U se me.  S in get out.  Sometimes, The alphabets on my results slips. Seem to have a greater importance than me. I wonder. What if my l1r5 was 22. Things will never be the same from that hour.  But I thank God that each time these feelings come, I'll turn my eyes upon Jesus. And i'll see 5 'idiots' Loving me for who i am Not what i've accomplished Not what i've done for them  God the Father God the Son God the Holy Spirit My Earthly father My Earthly mother  Lost of words to express my thanks..
