The past 4 days were spent mostly at home studying,stoning, slacking, procastinating, ocassionally go out for lunch.Lets see on wednesday had delicious roti prata!! near Nus that shop,erm cant remember the name. YUMMY that was like the first time i had prata since mid march. Value for money too ^-^. Oh and my comp is getting on my nerves with all the popups and lagginess due to the virus in the comp that cant be removed. Still searching for the last box set for gundam seed, cant wait to get it and finish off this fantastic series. YOu've got to watch it if u got the time.Attempts to dload it via kazaa is frustatingly slow.... tortourous is a more accurate word. Someone teach me how to use bit torrent, i'm a noobie at using bt. Ok thats all i am thinking so far, other than how to handle that dreaded hist paper.
