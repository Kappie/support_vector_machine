Nathan: I'll put you down for St. John's (Newfoundland?), but I've got to say A.) You are more in need of a night in Atlantic City than any man I've met and B.) You missed perfect opportunity to use "Dark was the Night, Cold was the Ground" as a title.  Marten: The random post was strange, but by "FIN!" you had me. Nothing gets me more than mock-art-film endings.  Erin: I'm putting you down for a seat in Taxxgrrl's car to the Lafayette TWoPCON.  Jonah: Your new title scheme is good, but you're going to run out of people and I'm going to laugh.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
