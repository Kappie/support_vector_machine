Not like his vessel...a "Gate-whey?" or the like. I am thinkin' more like a Seacraft SC32 Master Angler.  Yeah, I'm talking about a real boat here. Sorry for the stupid, "I'm acting like a pirate who doesn't understand..." talk.  I'ld love to have a boat. I like fishing, at least in the ocean, because I've actually caught things there. Plus, I'd be able to talk to Hart about more than just shitty boat charters and other crap.  Well, piracy of two kinds inspired this blog so I'll try to recount the convo...  Cam:"I've decided to become a major player in the piracy game." Cav:"Yeah...I'm looking to buy a boat." Cam:"LOL"  So it's not as complicated as it sounds, but it happened and I have nothing else to talk about. Oh fuckin well.
