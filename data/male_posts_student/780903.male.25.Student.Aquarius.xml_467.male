It made it sound pretty much like a paradise, actually, and then at the end talked about how it was beginning to modernize and had recently introduced television into the country for the first time.   urlLink This article , about what television seems to have done to their society, is very sad, and more than a little bit disturbing.  Much more interesting than the typical newspaper article.  Highly recommended.  I'd love to hear feedback on what other people think of it -- I thought it was a truly affecting story.
