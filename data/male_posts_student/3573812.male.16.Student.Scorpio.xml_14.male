I have issues that I have no hope of resolving unless I figure out what they are.  AARRRRGGGHHH!!!  I'm stupid and lazy and overly indulgent and self-involved and unreasonably emotional and arrogant and pathetic and obsessive and useless and ungrateful and unimpressed and repressed and whingy and whiny and apathetic and secretive and ignorant and hypocritical and I have no sense of direction.  I don't understand what I'm doing or what I'm saying or where I'm going or ANYTHING!!!  Nobody could ever understand me because I can't even begin to understand myself. I hate myself.
