I see the pestilence that strangles the trees.  I see the sludge that pollutes the vast ocean.  Call me whatever you will, I see it.  I see that we have made this earth hideous, and that there is not a single thing that has been spared our vile touch.  But I also see the beauty in everything.  In the flowers, in the faces of humans, in everything. Everything has its own beauty. The only problem with me is that I can see everything that has corrupted it. I, alone, can see the truth.   Robert Zend wrote an interesting little poem, called "World's Shortest Pessimistic Poem" and it reads:    Hope?
