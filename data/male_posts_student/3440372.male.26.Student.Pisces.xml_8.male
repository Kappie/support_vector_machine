Hate feeling scared and miserable, you'd think I'd be used to it by now. I think once one stops being scared when your body breaks down then you're on the slippery slope to a lovely nervous breakdown.  I am also wondering whether I want people to comment on my Blog. I kind of want it to be private but at the same time, I want people to comment on it. (Oh the contradiction that is me!)  Right, I suppose I should go and do some work  :: still quite calm ::   urlLink  not sure why I find this site compelling
