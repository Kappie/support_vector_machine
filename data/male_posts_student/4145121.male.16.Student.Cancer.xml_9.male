Yea, apparently, it's the holiday that keeps us up, and no one's gonna slp till all decide to slp. It was a cool convo, and after that, it was good slp fer me. Woke up at 10+ and prepared to cook lunch from around 12. Finished cooking at 2 +pm. My mum's basically my assistant, mwahaha. She's in charge of the cutting part and I'm in charge of the actual cooking. Six dishes today and all tasted great (I'm not being biased here), and I literally helped my mum to clear up the fridge. Way awesome. I tried cooking them in ways my mum never did, like stir frying cabbage, celery, meatballs and a dash of bean paste. Weird combi eh? But trust me, it tastes good. Also made a fish head soup...I stewed it so long that it turned white, and tastes...so...fishy? haha. Damn I love cooking. Haha..."tell me what u eat and i'll tell u what u are" is a famous quote by who-knows/cares-who. And so, my food's funky...and so I suppose I'm funky? Ya huh. I'm way high...like..Woohoo. Well. Good times are over, gonna mug now...still gonna thrash my mum in a game of tennis later (Hopefully), after I mug for at least 3 hours. Heh.
