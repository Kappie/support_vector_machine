The good think about blog is that its more powerful, you can do more things with it, and the graphics are better. The pros for xanga is that its easy to use and i can actually edit my xanga unlike blog. The con of blog is that you have to know HTML in order to do ANYTHING except posting. The cons for xanga is that they all look the same and of course its not as "powerful." O yeah and another thing is that blog has less down time then xanga, which means that you can edit at anytime for blog but sometimes you have to wait like 2 hours in order to post in the xanga. I cant confirm that this is true so if this happens or doesnt happen to you then please tell me. If you have any opinion of why you like one of these better then the other then PLEASE tell me. Right now i cant really decide so i plan to just keep on editing both until i come up with a choice.
