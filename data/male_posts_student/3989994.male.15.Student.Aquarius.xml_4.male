It always amuses me that sometime the "rightous" ppl preach and appear so darn serious abt a point but only to discover that they themselves do not take heed but of course they do it for the greater good.  So is the world like that? The cause need not matter the actions play no part, iniatiative is figurative don't be caught using initiative they punish u for it especially if ur better then them.   So long as u are the power, the authority anything goes. Afterall history is written by the winners
