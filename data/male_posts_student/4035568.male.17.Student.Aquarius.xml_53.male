He claims he knew who they were..but secretly they were all mass murderers out to kill him... You were a good guy...sumtimes. We'll miss you a lil bit. He met these people off a site about Saturn Cars...go figure. They took a roadtrip to Nashville to see the Saturn car factory. I told him tonot go....but he did..and now he is dead...I'll keep his legacy going on here.....well I can't....I'm not obsessed with cars like he is..oh well farewell stupid webpage partner!!      ~Laterz~    (this is a joke by the way..he isn't really dead..altho I know sum who wish he were!! AHA!)
