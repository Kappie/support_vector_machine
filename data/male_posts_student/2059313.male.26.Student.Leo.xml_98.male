I would like to direct your attention to a blog posted on Friday, October 17, 2003 @ 12:30am, and then at 12:30pm.   ===== "Friday will be my day to catch up on all the movies my friends have gone to see without me. Just me, Kill Bill, School of Rock, and an empty seat right next to me... just like old times.  This is going to be pathetic." -12:30am ===== Love. Sacrifice. Laughter. Compassion. A hug. A kind word. These are the greatest tools of friendship. Remember them. Use them.   BE them. -12:30pm ===== Well, I feel I've done one of those things, but not the other.  Time to do the other, unless of course it becomes necessary not to in order to do the other one again...   and I would do it again, without thought.
