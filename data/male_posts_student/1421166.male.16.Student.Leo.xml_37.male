It's like in my own world. I feel dizzy and stuff. Recently, I've been so reflective. Reflections that involved all the most important aspects of my life. Too reflective actually...so it's like a emotional overflow. I don't know what I'm feeling suddenly. It's like I'm no longer sane, but led only by my emotions. I don'tknow what to say. Just a short one here...I can't carry on...
