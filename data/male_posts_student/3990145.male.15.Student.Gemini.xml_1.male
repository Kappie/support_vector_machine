The show is about a guy call "Spooner" ,Will Smith, who hated robots because he asked a robot to save a girl in the past, but the robot saved him instead of that girl... Then the person who create the robot got thrown out of a window and landed on... Not very sure about the level... Hahahaha. Then bascially the story is about how that Spooner guy save the world from all those robots because the main computer controlled all the robots and wanted to take over the world and~ solve the case at the same time... Quite a nice show over all, with some funny parts. The techonoly at that time was really cool, how I wished I live there.. Haha, just without those robots... Haha.   Then after the show, You Lun and Alvin went home. Kam Chuen, Ser Chin and me went to sit at some where in the yishun bus interchange and chat... We talked about some gunbound stuff(hey hey don't get me wrong man I'm not a gunbound insane player... Just playing for fun..) and then it was about 5 p.m. then and Ser Chin went home and Kam Chuen came my house... We play gunbound for a while(actually I found it really gay... Hahaha.. personally~) then Ser Chin and Kenneth joined us.. We won like 10+ rounds in a row but was quite boring that so I went to play Counter-Strike... Erm... Thats about it bah... Then I went to have my dinner and its now~~ oh and Kam Chuen went home at about 10p.m... Tomorrow got basketball game so got to go sleep~~
