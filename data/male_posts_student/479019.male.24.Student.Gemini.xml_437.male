I'm surprised at how simple key lime pie is and how damn good it is.  I felt like the lay out of the menu worked quite well. The seafood and citrus combo. It was sort of transition from purely seafoody to more and more citrusy. Also it started and ended creamy. It helped that we had Corona with limes too.  I like doing the whole dinner party thing. I totally miss having them with the Cambridge girls. Perhaps we should have a little reunion thing this summer? I can always see if Mike, Jimmy, and Esther can make it?  Should I watch  The Cell  tonight?  ****
