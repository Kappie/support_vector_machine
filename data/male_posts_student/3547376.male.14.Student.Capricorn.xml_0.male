I feel I'm about to explode! I really want it now, or at least know that I'm going to get it. He annoys me so much. He doesn't even use it, he has a brand new one  his excuse is "i payed for this phone". Mind you, he bought it off my mum for $100 a year ago (the phone was worth about $400 then). He just annoys me so badly.  Sorry, but I had to get it off my chest. Anyway, this is MY blogg. I'm listening to HIM at the moment. They are the best. I just realised that in some of the songs they have subliminal messages. Like in one it was telling you to kill yourself. He wasn't singing it, but the really soft voice in the background  the words he songed made you think of killing yourself because "this life isn't worth living"... Sorry, had to write that also...
