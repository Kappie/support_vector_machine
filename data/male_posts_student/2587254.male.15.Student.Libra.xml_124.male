Wow.........I don't know what's with me today....or just with badminton.....but was April Fools plotting a joke against me? Lol I don't mean to sound cocky but I don't know how I managed to be undefeated at Central's first Badminton Quad Meet today. But yeah.......wow today's Quad meet.....TOTAL JOKE. Practices at school are more intense than today. Yeah though Oakridge gym sucks, their floor is like a skating rink, and their nets were always kinda sagging down in middle.....me and John still managed to shut out one team, and keep all the teams below 10 points. Well actually all but one below 5 points lol.  Today I managed to start the day off at 7:30. Yeah got decent sleep last night....wasn't too bad. French Toast for B-fast but we are now officially out of maple syrup *sigh.* So I'm stuck with....other sources of sweeteners for French Toast now. Grrr........Why can't we get more maple syrup. Headed out to school then....gave Patrick a lift also today.  Got to school......and wow history class got off to a REALLY lame start.  Ms. Manson: Alright class today we begin to look at what else was happening around the world in World War II. Better pay attention you gonna be havin' a quiz at the end of the day.  *class in pure silence*  Ms. Manson: APRIL FOOLS!  *more silence*  *Sigh * Ms. Manson's sense of humour for you. *ZZzZzzZzZzzZzzz.* After our class finally got the joke. Ha. Ha. Ha. .......... Yeah it was pretty boring as you can see. We focused on Russia campaign and how the Germans got their butts whooped, and Sicily and how Italians back in WWII basically did nothing. WHOA THEY INVADED ETHIOPIA....ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD. PIMPS! And when we invade they surrender immediately lol. So yeah history was kinda interesting today I guess. Talked about more than just Brits and Canadians.  Civics class today: talked about the Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau....you know the one that had TrudeauMania and everything? Probably biggest PM Pimp ever lol. Dated celebs, known throughout the world.......yeah he was like swingin' 60's Austin Powers for sure hahaha. Also he pissed off USA, and united the French.....what more could be better =P. So yeah I guess he was a pretty awesome PM....*shrug.* Sounds more exciting than Jean Chretien or Paul Martin......most excitement they got is yelling at each other for a scandal that made Canada lose over 30 million dollars. Gains public attention AND hatred? Wow great combo.  Lunch..went to Galleria today. John didn't go though and instead gave Mike $$$ to buy John's food to bring back. Lol felt like pizza delivery boy for a bit since I had to caarry the stuff. Heather and Jessica I think is her name came along too......well more like by coincedence.....funny though since Nate burned Heather...forgot what he said but was pretty funny lol. Hermann also was acting like a queer today......I don't know what happened.......Quad Meet attitude? hahahaah j/k. But yeah today's lunch....."WEIRDED OUT" in quotes from Strong Bad.  Math class......yes I was late like usual. I kinda jumped in and asked "AM I LATE?" when everyone was sitting in desks and Mr. G was already writing stuff on chalkboard. *OOOOk I think I'm late* was my reaction lol. Mike then ran in and gave John his lunch lol. Pretty random I know....running into a classroom with a box and a pop? lol yeah I was wondering how embarrased Mike felt. Then again he ran X-country so he's used to it =P. haha jokes man. Math was pretty straight forward.....learned about "similar" triangles today. You know they look the same but ones bigger than other? Those things....*shrug* it's math boring ok? Well except for when funny things happen lol. Oh yeah and math mark........82 NOW HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! IT'S GONE UP TWO PERCENT! Shweeeeeet.......now to worry about english *grr*.......  Programming class.....lol 5 people get kicked out 30 seconds into class hahaha. Oh yeah Ryan's back from suspension also *anti-semetic material on his site* but he was still kicked off comps lol. Dan apparently can actually make a Pac-Man game while we are all just animating Pac-Man. REALLY scary..........BUT COOOL haha. Hmm yeah worked on Hyperstudio.....I'M NOW OFFICIALLY DONE! ^_^.....not much else happened.....pretty much just couldn't wait for Quad meet.....exciting no =P. Actually it wasn't as I'll explain later....  BELL RINGS! YES! QUAD MEET! WHOO HOO! TIME TO OPEN A CAN OF WHOOP ASS! Well we left school around 2:40.....and me Hermann and John got to take the Taxi school provided haha. Arrived at Oakridge....and found Gym without much of a problem.   "Joe John you idiots it's over there." "HERMANN notice how all the athletes are headed left." "Shut up."  That was basically only problem lol. Other than that we were stoked and ready to whoop some ass. Now personally I thought we'd win........but not obliterate. Actually in fact I thought we may lose a game or two.....but no like I said we obliterated EVERYONE lol. It was pretty funny actually....playing at school was more intense than playing today. In fact some people are actually WORSE than Finlan. IS THAT POSSIBLE!? Sadly yes lol. 6-0. UNDEFEATED IN 6 GAMES. Sadly lol. I thought we would die....since I mean me and John we kinda suck but surprisingly we won all 6 lol. Finlan won one game in mixed....and Hermann was 6-0 also. Girls didn't do too bad either. I think Aleksandra *however you spell her name* will be pretty good Gr. 10 when next year comes. But yeah first Quad meet of the year.........what a joke lol. I started practicing playing w/ left hand and my horrific net serve. Oh yeah also somehow when I was practicing smash we beat Saunders 11-0 lol. So yeah note to self and other badminton players in London: Saunders, Banting *no offense Lina=P* and Oakridge are HORRIBLE lol. I wonder if STA sucks this much this year....I MITE BE ABLE TO GET PAST ROUND TWO THIS YEAR AT CONFERENCE =P. And oh yeah Thompson......he's got his smash back now *sorta* hehehehehe. Net shots today were actually pretty good though. Don't know what I'd do w/out backup haha. I'd be screwed in Singles. So yeah props to you Mophead...good job today haha.  Gave John a lift home....then headed home. Some houses in his area are HUGE. Apparently one mansion has an indoor pool, outdoor pool and skating rink. Wow. BIIIIG house. So yeah gave Mophead a ride back home and then I headed home........to my house. Ate some stuff, blogged for now....and now I am going to go do other things. Hehe lates.
