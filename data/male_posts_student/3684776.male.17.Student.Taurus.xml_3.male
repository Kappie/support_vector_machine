The  mirror  that always show something that I can’t resist having. I said to myself that it’s against the rule, it’s against the law, if  once I break the principle, my life will be empty, or dead. I really need it to complete what I lost. I need it, yet I cannot have it. I can’t. Its so pain to  see  it moves, talks and breathes single, or maybe it has been taken, but its so lonely, yet there might be someone that  found it  1st or attracted it. It is so beautiful, so beautiful that your eyes could just  cry warm tears that kill. (I can’t take the pain any longer, I have to tell, but yet, I can’t  br eak  the rules… I love; I love it  really really much , more then anything, yet its against the rules…)
