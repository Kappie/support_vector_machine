Just that Frostheart, aka Seth from  urlLink http://tekhnikolorprojektor.blogspot.com/ , Light and some real life friend of mine offered a comeback to RO. english RO that is. A malaysian server. Seth said he will spare me 3 millions of zenny(RO's currency) for me to start off. I have decided to play a Swordman(infact, the first class since I started ROing) and get him to job level 50. Turn him into a Crusaderto my upmost delight. I plan to start my Swordman with my custom build of VIT > AGI = INT, Devoted Crosser.  Anyway, Seth turned to 29 a few days ago. Congratulations, dude. Happy go older. May your wish of having a busty girl by your side be fullfilled. Then, life sucks hahaha. Did you break those red ceremonial hard boiled eggs? Or did you dropped a piece of cake onto your executive? Or even set a horn in a pair of booties? Hahaha, was joking. Life is not as kinky as you(and I) imagine. We are just being dynamic. Duh, about little girl prosties and your fat boobies... Heck, peace guys. Zengar out.
