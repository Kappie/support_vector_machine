Its becoming increasingly more apparent to me that I dont suck as bad as I think I do. Today when we were rehearsing I could play everything pretty well. I still have to tongue number "5" and have some trouble with "7" but everything else is coming out well. I think in about 2 or 3 weeks ill have everything down and im happy about that. All thats left for me now is to be able to hold my horn up but im guessing that comes with time. haha, Its pretty cool be in an amazing hornline thats extremly loud, its really cool, and next week we get to march.
