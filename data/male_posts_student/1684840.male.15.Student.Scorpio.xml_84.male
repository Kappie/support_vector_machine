We went the cinema to see Finding Nemo, which is a wicked film!!!  "I shall call him squishy, and he shall be mine, and he shall be my squishy" lol  So anyway, the half term ends here.  I've just been to York for the weekend and that was ok.  I wasn't feeling to well though, which spoiled it :(  The York Dungeon was great!  I had giggle fits every night and one of the main reasons was because of the  urlLink Hypnotoad  from Futurama, daft I know!  I'm off to bed now because it's that 'S' place in the morning, cya :)  P.S:  My birthday on Friday!  Buy me a present or I will stalk you and pelt you with soggy wet sponges... You have been warned :P
