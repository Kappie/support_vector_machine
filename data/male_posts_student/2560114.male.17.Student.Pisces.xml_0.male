Well first off...dis year was when i first got into da varsity team, I have a lot of memories durin da season, like gettin into da playoffz and all kindz of stuff. Also dis was da year where i found a beautiful girl who i have fallin deeply inlove wit, ahhhh...too bad thingz didnt go da way we both wanted. The hard times and da good times we shared were very memorable...and were probly a big part of my life. My love for u dis year was da strongest i have ever felt about someone...through all da girlz i have been wit durin my life...none of dem stood out da way u did, whenever i c u or talk to u...it just makes my day and i feel happy...but idk where dis stuff is goin...eh, i feel pathetic bout stayin in love wit u, but i just have a feelin dat im doin da right thing but...only time will tell. But ya know imma keep fightin...tryin to get to thoze betta dayz...imma keep fightin fo what i believe...imma keep fightin fo da happiness im longin fo. Also dis was a year where i found my true friend, my homeboy darrell danque, wit out dat guy...man, i would probly still b a depressive wreck and probly just b a sad person fo da rest of my life. I would take a bullet fo dat guy ppl...fa realz. As i look back...all i could just do is smile...all da new thangz i have experienced...all da new friendz i have made... all da memoriez dat will b wit me fo a long time. Also all da craziness dat was goin on and all da answerz i have found out and all da questionz dat have came after. Yes, my friendz, dis has been one of da most memorable yearz dat i will ever have, but there is gonna b a new one comin up in a few hourz. Hopefully, thangz will b betta and my love life, my vball life, even my school life, will improve and change fo da betta. Hehe, thinkin about what happened dis year is just kinda funny to me, but whateva...C U NEXT YEARRR PPL!!!...Dis b charlez and my outta hurrrrr
