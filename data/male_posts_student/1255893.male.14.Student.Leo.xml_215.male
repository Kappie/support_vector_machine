There's no need to be sorry about anything. You got to be w/ her fair and square. I won't try to say much more. All I can say is that this is one thing you have to try to go through on your own. Don't take people's BS about "there's more fish in the sea" or "you'll meet someone nice" cus I know you probably don't wanna hear it. If ya wanna talk to me about something though. Email me instead. Get my address in my profile if you don't already have it. Anywho, take care dude. Best of luck and all that good stuff.
