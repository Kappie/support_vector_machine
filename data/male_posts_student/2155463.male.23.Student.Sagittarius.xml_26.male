Yep...2003 Hyundai Accents are on sale up in Cleveland, so I gotta go up there on Saturday and check them out.  Oh, but I gotta learn how to drive a manual for before then ;)  Second, got a hold of my dad and we have a legitimate explanation for the amounts on my special circumstances form, so maybe I'm back in business there.  Also got some more info over to Christ about the internship and WPNI, so maybe Sen. DeWine will come through with some good 'ol funding (yep, that's right, your tax dollars hard at work - supporting ME!!!).  Had a really interesting discussion with Melissa tonight; it was kinda nice to relate with someone else about some of the spiritual things goin on in my life.  Someday maybe I'll even get enough courage to post some of them on here, but for the time being y'all will have to just have to hold your breaths for a little longer (I promise it isn't anything amazingly deep or anything like that; in fact, quite the opposite).  OK, gotta get goin on my Direct Dem paper...11:30 and just starting a 5-page paper.  YIKES!!
