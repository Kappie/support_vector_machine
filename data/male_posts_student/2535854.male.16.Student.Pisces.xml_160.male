All they did was sing Negaraku and the School song and just announce the names of those that were getting awards on the Commencement`s day...but most awards are to be awarded in the morning awards giving ceremony and crap and some at night during the dinner show. Anyway finaly they gave  Cheryl   someaward  of some sort  for fencing  and stuff.... They didn`t give anything last time to those who took part in Sukma just cause she didn`t win anything of fare very well...Losuy school..Haha...Okay yikes! Must wear formal attire for the Show! I was so planning what tow ear...fine i`ll wear the Blazer...but I refuse to wear school pants! I shall wear black trousers like I originally planned to! Heh. I hope so about my shirt choice as well. But i`m definately bringing my camera and taking photos like crap. I promise that I truly will take lots of photos! Mark my words you lousy biatches!      English was funny with Afandi and stuff being scolded like crap and stuff...Heheh.. Mrs. Rama was asking "Who`s Inky?" cause he wrote down 'Inky' on his paper that he and Farouq did. By the way the assignment was to write a summart on the poem we did today which was 'There`s Been a Death In the Opposite House (I think) by Emily Dickinson. Me and Shahril`s paper was the best. Only   three   mistakes! Haha! So she didn`t call us and start scolding us and rapping about anything! We rule.        Well for some weird reason, the computer (my Packard Bell desktop, not my laptop) has problems connected to the internet when it was fine last week....so brought it to Yusri at Mid Valley who took out the old modem and said it was probably fried...so he sold us an Aztech USB modem which is so cute :-)!!!! So small! You can just slit it into your pocket and stuff! So compact and portable. He even installed it for me and saved me the trouble of having to. Heheh. It cost rm150 since I`m becoming a 'regular customer'. Lol. Damn modern technology!      So then Tok Su Arif and his wife and Kassim who looks like some Arab kinda guy since his mom`s English and stuff...Think he`s an accountant. So while mom was getting ready refreshments and stuff, I sat down and chatted with them and basically entertained them! They came anyway by the way, to visit my grandma..and she seems to talk alot and smile when relatives and stuff are around which is good. Heh. Found out alot of stuff from em. And they also learned quite a bit from. I`m so different from my brothers. They are relatively quiet and stuff and think a bit. I`m more sponteneous and louder and more talkative! Finally I can make some good use outta all that 'talent' of mine ;p.      So after they left and stuff at 7 pm, hooked the computer back up and stuff...wiped up all the dust around there and seperated the wires as bets as I could so only the power system wires and the sound system wires will maybe perhaps get tangled up a bit...but things still not co-operating with me. Firstly I belive the system was unstable cause of all that assembling and when it finally started up, the screen and its colours were all screwed up so i`ll have to see about it..      Anyway I`m going for Francis acc class 2moro....got some undone work..cia0loz!
