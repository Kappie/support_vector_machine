Whether said art comments on the society in which it is displayed or an alternate society in order to bring enlightenment, artists typically have something to say, and their art is their voice.  Music is certainly no exception to this rule, and the fundamental tenet of the more alternative vein of music which we, dear reader, typically align ourselves with, is most definitely to comment on society.  But what is the basis for this commentary?  Without question, psychology.  It is the basis of the artist's voice, and psychology often works not only in predictable ways, but also in lesser known ways.  Most of us who have opposable thumbs and the ability to read have heard of Dr. Sigmund Freud, who postulated and theorized quite literally the basis of most of modern-day psychology as we know it.  One core theory of Freud's concerns the Id, the Superego, and the Ego.  These widely accepted psychological models are more prevalent in modern-day music than one might realize, as they together are more or less present in each and every one of us.  Freud tells us the Id is the primitive unconscious consisting of fundamental drives.  The Id is irrational, impulsive, and seeks immediate gratification with no consideration for what is realistically possible, socially desirable, or morally acceptable.  It is governed by the pleasure principle – the unregulated search for gratification, especially sexual, physical, and emotional pleasures – to be experienced here and now without concern for the consequences.  The Id is self-centered, and looks inward only.  Certainly, much of modern day music has sexual, physical, and emotional overtones, but most of the modern, bubble-gum pop music heard on Top 40 radio lacks the intensity that one would imagine is involved in 'primitive' and 'impulsive' decisions.  More alternative artists such as Nine Inch Nails, however, certainly embody the Id, and go so far as to embrace it.  Nine Inch Nails' abrasive and eclectic sound, searing vocals, and indisputably raw emotion, both recorded and live, most definitely make tangible Freud’s theory of the Id.  And much of the lyrical content of Nine Inch Nails is certainly inwardly focused, centering on one's journey through self-exploration.  With the yin, there must always be a yang.  Freud also postulated the Superego, or storehouse of one's values, including moral attitudes learned from society.  The Superego is one's conscience, consisting of that inner voice of 'oughts' and 'should nots'.  The Superego also includes the Ego Ideal – an individual's view of the kind of person one should strive to become.  The Superego is often in conflict with Id – while the Id wants to do what feels good, the Superego operates on the morality principle and insists on doing what is right.  The Superego looks not towards the inner self, as the Id does, but instead focuses on the outer world and its morality.  The Superego is most definitely present in standard pop music, but to a much lesser extent in the more hardcore veins.  While Britney Spears is happy to package her ass for sale on the cover of her records, yet wouldn't be caught dead in the nude anywhere, at anytime (despite what those alluring pop-up ads tell you), Raymond Watts (of Pig/Watts/KMFDM fame) goes the extra mile and pulls his cock out onstage (I know...sadly, I was front row and witness to it).  One could certainly attribute Watts' dick tricks to the Id's victory over the Superego, and Britney's reluctance to bare all, despite the fact 90% has been bared already, indicates instead the triumph of the Superego.  This unconscious factor theorized by Freud is present in everyone, but in artists such as Britney, it is simply more dominant.  To round out Freud's theory nicely, he also theorized the Ego – the reality-based aspect that arbitrates conflict between Id impulses and Superego demands.  The Ego, Freud says, consist of one's beliefs about the causes and consequences of behaviour.  Governed by the reality principle, which puts reasonable choices before pleasurable demands, the Ego arranges compromise between the conflicting Id and Superego.  Thus, the Ego is the arbitrator, or seeker of common ground.  Marilyn Manson, anyone?  While Nine Inch Nails' typically brutal, all-out aural assault is influenced primarily by the Id, and Britney Spears unwillingness to shows us every square inch of her breasts is controlled by the Superego, Manson's music adheres more to the Ego.  Marilyn Manson take their role as artists seriously, and as such have a lot to say about society.  But rather than simply focus on the pleasure-based principles (rap's continuous yearning for 'booty'), or rather than play it safe by performing easily digestible, zero-to-say music (pop's continuous yearning for um...erm...bright lights, tight pants, and a Pepsi sponsorship?), Marilyn Manson analyze society, and comment on it by providing solutions, albeit rather extreme and unusual alternatives ("light a candle for the sinners / set the world on fire").  Thus, Manson embrace their Ego, rather than letting their Id or Superego dominate, and as a result enjoy more controversy and media attention than artists who allow their Id and Superego to hold the reins.  Beyond Freud's basic structure of personality, several post-Freudian descendants expanded on his basic theories of the unconscious.  One such psychologist is Carl Jung, a student of Freud.  He greatly expanded on the conception of the unconscious.  For Jung, the unconscious was not limited to an individual's life experiences, but was also filled with fundamental psychological truths shared by the entire human race.  Jung believed the concept of collective unconscious predisposes us all to react to certain stimuli in the same way and consists of archetypes associated with an instinctive tendency to feel and think about it or experience it in a special way.  These archetypes, known as animus in the case of male archetypes, and anima in the case of female archetypes, are primitive symbolic representations of a particular experience or object.  And these archetypes, both male and female, are present in each and every one of us, and guide us daily in our actions, says Jung.  Now these are relatively big words and theories for the general population, and you would have a hard time convincing this author of evidence of this concept to a great degree in Christina Aguilera's latest offering.  Attend a Tool concert, however, and it's a completely different story.  Tool’s heavy, prog-rock sound, laced with complex lyrics, undulating imagery, and surreal art suggests just the opposite: these are well-read believers in psychology and Jung's basic tenets, and their live show is evidence of this even more than their deliciously intricate records.  Large screens typically overhanging the stage continually bombard the audience with imagery naturally encouraging the audience to unconsciously reach deeper into the collective unconscious in seek of wisdom and fundamental truths.  Spoken word clips from Timothy Leary and other avant-garde artists emulate the collective unconscious.  And might I remind the reader of one of Tool's more popular records, Ænima?  A cross-breed of the psychological term 'anima' and the considerably less pleasant (at least for most) 'enema', Ænima is Tool’s humorous play on words that parallels the anima’s continual presence in all of us in conjunction with a collective mindfuck.  While each and every individual on the planet have in theory all of the aforementioned psychological factors at work in their subconscious, the artists described above simply lean towards one or another more directly.  Yet they all are present in our thought processes, the Id and Superego engaged in an eternal tug-of-war, while the Ego maintains balance.  And hovering above all of these processes, says Jung, are the male and female archetypes in every one of us guiding us all in a similar fashion.  So, the next time you're spinning a disc, look past the glitzy album cover and the latex encased body, and inwardly challenge the musician to speak to you on these basic psychological planes.  You might be surprised at what you hear, or perhaps what you don't. xBuBzx
