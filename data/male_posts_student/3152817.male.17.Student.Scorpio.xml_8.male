No, not how Sivits got off easy w/ his prison sentence (more on this later).  What really bugs the heck out of me are stupid welfare whores that come to the igloo 2 freakin minutes before we close and order a crap load of ice cream.  It wouldn't be too bad if it were a cone or something, but no, they have to order flurrys and sundays and banana splits.  It's bad enough that I have to give up part of my paycheck to fund the program they live off of.  They don't have to rub it in by making my job that much harder.  Now don't get the wrong idea here.  I like my job.  I don't mind serving ice cream to people.  Just have enough respect to not order 20 freakin things 2 minutes before we close.  (Note...the igloo closes at  10:00  PM)
