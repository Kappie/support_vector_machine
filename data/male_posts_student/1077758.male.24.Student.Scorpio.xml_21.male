I'm going to be reamed for that...but in a good way.  Water is a constantly original metaphor if used properly, and she uses it so well in her stories and poetry.  If people could be elements,  she would be the blossoming crest of a wave, salty and charged with the power of the ocean's thirst to know the land that it slowly conquers.  I hope that softens the reaming up a bit.
