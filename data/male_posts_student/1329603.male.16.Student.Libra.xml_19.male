Personally I'd be a tree hugger, providing I wouldn't have to move ^O^ I'm such a hypocrite, isn't it great? ^_^  I sang a song about Fidel Castro at Marx today, methinks he were a bit... feeling I was immature. Oh well, immaturity is fun.  I'm really hungry though... I'll make some noodles in a bit.  Current mood: Feeling quite high, actually.  Love, Jon Roskilly
