A short-circuited speaker was the cause of the problem, leaving some 10,000 fans to wait an hour while  Duff's  crew changed the speaker. While on-site coordinators reported that no one was injured, there was mild commotion amidst the front row, where the heat could be felt significantly.  Duff's  bodyguards commented that the fire was alarming, but it did go well with the 10,000 flames in the audience.
