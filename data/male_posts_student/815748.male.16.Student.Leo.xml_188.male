The walk was entertaining, and the movie was alright notwithstanding the fact that it didn't know when it was over.  I am beginning to anticipate going to Tanzania.  I am against anticipation, though.  So... whatever.  Loren did the best on the quiz, even before he cheated.  It was annoying, however, when he kept rubbing it in afterwards, trying to make himself sound like a truer friend.  Whadayagannado.
