But seriously, I am feeling pretty good right now. Everything is A-OK. I got an A on my term paper that I wrote so long ago. My parents actually congratulated me for the first time in a long time. Brian Conroy is getting better. Martha is happy. Prom will r0xXoR. So, If you were planning to rain on my parade, could you please at least wait till the summer? I'm trying to finish the year on a good note. Thank you, please come again!
