She was reading some poem when I konked out, and I woke up in an instant, but everything was silent.  Scared the hell out of me.  Apparently we were supposed to respond to the poem I slept through.  Can somebody help me out?  -  Over the weekend, I finally got back into Fleetwood Mac.  Good stuff.  -  I've been so pissed at my computer.  I don't even wanna get into it.  -  Thunderstorms are the most frightening weather pattern ever.  I mean, Christ, the rain is fine, it's just the large rumbling sounds and large streams of static electricity I'm nervous about.  It's not unreasonable.  -  Cranny is getting slowly more and more intolerable.  It's fucking incredible.  And his class is boring right now, because, well, you all know.  Oi.  -  Now that I took that goddamn nap in Klaas, I can't sleep, this sucks.  -  For some odd, odd reason, one(or more) of my teachers nominated me for Link Crew (I refuse to call it "Thunder Crew").  Apparently, they're trusting me with the fragile psyches of a group of incoming Freshmen.  Ooh, this is a perfect opportunity to be mean to a few freshies (Just kidding, I'll be good...)  -  Salad!
