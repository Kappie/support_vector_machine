So I'm at meijer and get ready to leave when the sirens go off, and i'm like oh crap they better not make me stay here. So a lady like saw me so I took off down the isle, then she's like SIR SIR!!!! I was like "oh great".  She made me go back into this one room where they do training with all the other meijer people, so I sat there for an hour!!  With Arvid Olsen I might add... good times.  The meijer guy comes in and he's like you can go home but we don't recommend you do, but i left anyway, did't think it was that big of a risk.  The cops wouldn't let me on 26, so I went through some subdivisions and got home, lol.  There was no one on the road so it was so freaky!  When I got home, I just looked outside of my garage at all the stormy stuff, with the moving trees and the lightning and thunder, and it was a huge reality check with the power of God.  He's soooooo powerful!  And this isn't even close to all the stuff he can do.  God is soooo huge, and he still cares about each of us!  That's wild, and that's love.  Just a thought to think about...  So that was a really fun experience, but I'm really jealous of Jordan Brand cause she actually got to see it!  Ugh, that would've been cool!Also I'm made cause I didn't get to buy the new toothpaste I wanted, lol, oh well!  Summer's easy.... Keep it real, I'm Will
