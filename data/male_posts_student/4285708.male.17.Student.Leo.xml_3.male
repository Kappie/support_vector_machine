Recently, its become more obvious to people that oil was one of the current American administration's objectives in the invasion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Agreed, Hussein was a brutal, despicable man who needed to be taken from power. Sadly, it is more likely than not that our humanitarian spirit was not on the trigger the night Babylon burned. However, what is thicker: oil or blood? Is a few hundred more barrels of near-Eastern crude really worth the lives of young men and women, some fresh out of high school? At issue is not our need for oil or (sadly) our humanitarian spirit. What is is who is in who's pocket. The government and big oil? The government and *gasps* the House of Saudi? In times like this, full of war and confusion, greed and mistrust, we need a man to lead our country that knows what its like to feel the heat and hear the cries of war. While Sen. John Kerry was having unforgettable, horrific images of death and human frailty burned into his mind, a certain well-known Texas Republican was changing the channel whenever the TV news mentioned that ugly word: Vietnam. Would a "war president" do that? Could John Kerry turn the channel and make his comrade live again? The next time you fill up your car, think about what oil might mean to your neighbor's son at his post in Baghdad, or to your best friend's sister who could be watching the ancient minarettes of Najaf tonight. Ask yourself what kind of man should lead a country on a day, and in an age where blood costs $1.80 a gallon.
