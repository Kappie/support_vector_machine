I don't really want to wake him, so I decided I would post before going downstairs to tackle another chapter of my book.  My dog is getting old. It makes me sad to know that within the next year or two, we will probably have to put him down. We're his third home, and he's spend more time with us than with the other two families. He used to be such a pretty dog, now he smells of decay. You know how animals get when they age. He's been a good dog.  I must say, I am fairly pleased with the current staff at RadioShack right now. Alex is great, she's fun and seems to be fairly smart. She's also a Scorpio, so we get along well. Megan, she's great, too. Great taste in music. Andrew brings a level of maturity, something that is needed very much in an atmosphere like that. Scott, he's a good guy, seems like a really caring person. A softie. And Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. Goof.   I can't wait till friday. For three reasons.  1. The first of two days off, planning on shopping, and watching movies. Chilaxing. 2. Payday. Will make shopping worthwhile. 3. Am planning on doing all of this with Phaedra.  If that is not a perfect Friday, I don't know what is.  Well. It's time to wake the dog.   link of the day:  urlLink the natatorium
