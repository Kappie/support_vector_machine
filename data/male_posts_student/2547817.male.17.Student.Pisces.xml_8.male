Inferiority complexes. From what I have come to understand, There are three types. It's very intriguing, this whole concept of feeling low. Who's to judge a man's worth but He who created man? Why would one feel like a lesser being in the first place? I think, it could be attributed to one of two factors or both. The individual's surroundings and psychology.  One type is that which lowers himself to the pits. Yap, are you reading this man? They are actually worth a lot more than they realize. Yap plays the guitar and drums, is good at pool and C.S., is handsome and has a heartwarming smile. He's got a good ear for harmonies and an even better heart. His friends wonder, many a time, why he hangs with company which doesn't do much good to his self esteem.  The other type is another boy I knew when I was in Sec 3 and 4. This version prompts the individual to make themselves out to be much greater than they actually are. This boy THINKS he sings really well and is really REALLY suave with the ladies. That he's really handsome and extremely interlectual. That he knows his rights and that he's always and I mean ALWAYS right. An expert in the field of astrophysics and quantum theory. He's got quite a few fathers I've heard. Day one: "My dad works in the army in a top secret faction". Day two: "My dad works as a Pilot at S.I.A.". Day three: "My dad works at N.A.S.A.". HHHHAhahahahahahaha!!!!! Really, need I say much more? Either that, or he had a very very active mother.   There's this other guy I know now in college. He cracks too many Indian jokes. Pretty offensive stuff if you ask me. So, why does he have inferiority complex? He's Indian, that's why. The way I see it is like this, he cracks the Indian jokes, people laugh at him, he feels good and accepted and hurrah, he's accepted. He dosen't realize that he's already accepted regardless of the percentage of melanin content in his skin. He should stop trying to impress or humor. Never the less, he is a nice guy. Gotta hand that to him.  Why the hell did I do this today?
