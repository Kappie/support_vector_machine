BOOK -  urlLink Less Than Zero  MUSIC -  urlLink Sunny Day Real Estate - Diary , but  urlLink Radiohead - OK Computer  hit at a right time, too.   MOVIE -  urlLink Fame   So I just messaged someone on Friendster.  Let the hypocrisy crash around me.  Went surfing for blogs, found her site, just pictures, all clean (not always the Friendster case).  Nose ring.  I've listened to too much Benny Mardones tonight.
