I had to go pick up my brother from the airport, he came home from some other state (don't remember, haha), and now, my break from having him around is over.  So, I stayed home and did some work after I got back, and then fell asleep, and now, here I am.  Now, about this big download.  I swear, if my satellite connection shuts down while I'm in the middle of this, I'll personally go up to the roof, knock it down, and go beg for DSL or something.  I'm downloading America's Army, which is one of the only good free games.  The army uses it as a training tool for new members in the army, but, its also available for anyone else who wants to play a good game.  I've heard nothing but good remarks on it, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  It's 745 megabytes, and it's been downloading for about 2 hours now, and its gotten about 70 done now.  I swear, that satellite shuts off, it can expect to find itself in the river.    And More?  Well, let me think about what I can put for the "And more" section of the title...hmmm. Here's something.  I've been dying to get a G-MAIL (hint to those at Blogger, who are owned by Google) account, and hopefully I'll get an invite out of Blogger soon.  G-mail gives you 1 gb of space, so you'll never have to erase your email messages again.  It's ideal for bigger attachments, and it's got a much better interface than Hotmail and Yahoo.  Hopefully I'll get some sort of invite from someone soon.  Alright, so, as some have noticed, I've taken more of an interest in baseball lately (after working with the baseball team for the past few months, upping up my photography skills).  So, I've been thinking about what baseball game to buy, and I think I made a decision between either MLB Slugfest Loaded or MVP Baseball 2004.  It's going to be on Xbox, either way, since it has the best graphics, and the best controller (in my opinion, anyway), and I'll get it before I leave for the summer workshop, just in case anyone else is interested in playing.  I need to get a new controller though, the stupid dog ate mine.  So, with Spiderman 2 (gotta buy it), MVP Baseball 2004, and a new controller, I'm going to blow through about $150 in the next month or so.  Spiderman 2 is going to be first though.  I'm getting that next week.  Enough about games and computers and stuff, what am I doing this week?  Well, hopefully on Saturday or Sunday I'll be going to Universal or something.  I'm just dying to get on Revenge of the Mummy.  I've heard that for the most part, it's an awesome ride.  Today, I'm probably just going to lounge around, doing nothing, and I'll probably have a new edition of Absolute Boredism tonight, if things go the way I don't want them to.  Heh, it'll only be about a week or two before I'll have Absolute Boredism Vol. X, if this keeps up.  Anyway, I'm going to go try and keep myself entertained (Gran Turismo, probably), so, until next time, don't be like me, go find something to do.
