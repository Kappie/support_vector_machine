My friends have been calling for me and asking me to come out but I really don't feel like it. When I'm down I get pissed off at stupid things lol.  We went town to pay for Visas and go to the dentist. My teeth are fine; I'm glad to see my new brushing regime has payed off. Saw a couple of people I wish I had rather not. I can't wait to move and get away from some pathetic people, but I want to stay for a certain few friends who haven't been getting on my nerves. I keep thinking against it though sometimes... what actually do I need to stay here for other than a few people?  Grandma has been given the go-ahead to book the suite at the Alton Towers hotel sometime in the month. I've been having way too many theme park dreams lol. For some reason, Oblivion is starting to scare me more than Nemesis, and I haven't even been on that (yet) but have been on Oblivion twice! Anyway, totally go on everything!  Sam's back tomorrow aparantly so I hope I might be able to go out with him and other mates to have a laugh, if I feel like it. The weather has been so crap today, Autumn is approaching!
