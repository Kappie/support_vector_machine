I can do a resit for maths in November if I need to! (But who gives a f**k about German, never liked the subject)! Only 4 exams left until the END of my GCSEs! That will be like more than 30 hours of exams! Two Business Studies, Physics and Statistics, left. Nice one. Completely brilliant. Utterly fantabulous. Still, four too many!  OOh when I was riding home from the.. English! exam yesterday afternoon, from the road next to the wind turbine I had a great view of what looked like half the town on fire. Turned out it was  urlLink this ! The  urlLink mails  been wortwhile reading lately, with nuclear power station leaks and what not... but whoever keeps putting in pictures of the mayor on his bike every few days needs a good slap 'round the chops. If you wanna see a bit more about 'Artlepool go  urlLink here , and compulsorily  urlLink HERE !  I suppose I'll toddle off and watch some TV. I've been on the computer for like.. 6 hours. Give me a life?!
