Anyhow, few days ago, we ate dinner with parents friends (they had two kids - gr.1 girl and gr.3 boy) at a japanese restaurant. That was expensive but delicious =P   We stopped by our house and I duelled with the kid. (duelling as in duel monsters for those that don't yet know). It reminded me of something.. about how the kid's parents was saying how I was a good influence. I know he must really look up to me, cause one time when we went to their house, he skipped a birthday party just cause I was coming... =\ do i really deserve that kinda respect? Also, another set of parents thought I was good influence...   So I start wondering... am I really good influence? I might be... I mean, I believe in good and everything like that, don't do drugs/alcohol/smoke, and get fairly good marks. Does the parents really think that hanging around me might do their children some good though? It makes me almost feel obliged to teach them something or other...   Well, I don't think I can do much more than what I already do, which is just act normal. I think that they'd start mistrusting me if I start becoming too much like a teacher or parent. So, in conclusion, I think I'll do nothing, and just continue on.   Next item, I started reading Hunter X Hunter... it happens to be quite an interesting series, and I definitely look forward to reading the rest of it. Kurapica is the coolest character I've ever met.. and at first I mistaken him as a girl... too bad he wasn't =P anyhow, he's the last living member of some clan, and is becoming a hunter to take revenge on the evil people. When he gets angry, his eyes turn red... kinda reminds me of how the badgers in Redwall have the "bloodlust" ability.    My opinion of H x H is that it's a story of 4 peoplewho became friends, trying to achieve their own goals and helping each other achieve theirs. Then finding that their goals are intertwined.    Next item: I'm starting to volunteer at a day camp thingy this week, so I'm definitely not going to be online as much. It's pretty fun, even though more work than during March Break or Christmas. I don't mind, because I actually feel like I'm doing something useful, instead of hanging around and playing with the kids like before.    Though a lot of the time, we just do that. I say "we" cause there's another volunteer, some guy that's one year older than me, and surprisingly, I found that he was from Brebeuf, my old school. Oh... I also met DYT there, she's a LIT, and I knew beforehand she'd be there. I'm be getting 20 hrs by the end of the week: 50 hours total.   Yah... I saw a rainbow today too... it was weird, I look at it closely for awhile, then went back to playing basketball, and from far, the rainbow seemed bigger oO;; Maybe cloud movements... who knows.   Enough with my inane chatter... that's all for now.   ~Chronos
