You gotta hear it to really appreciate it though.  Artist: Lloyd  Album: Thoughts From A Driveway  Song: Listening For Whispers   Another day is gone And I can't find a shooting star Is this a message Or an acid test of faith?  I've prayed a thousand times But I can't hear a sole reply This "waiting patiently" Is more than I can take  She was afraid of mine Awaiting some angelic vision She lost a lifetime Searching for a sign  [chorus] Don't you know that We are listening for whispers When we cannot hear the screams  The sun is blinding us And still we look for matches We cannot just deny this anymore  He was a fortune teller Always working late night He spent his days in search of something That was real  She was a beggar in the park Where he was contemplating She said that he was blind 'Cause God is here  [chorus]
