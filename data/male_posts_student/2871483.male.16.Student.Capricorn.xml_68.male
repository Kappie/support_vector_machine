Well do you wanna dance under the moonlight? Squeeze me baby all through the night Oh baby, do you wanna dance?  -  See, shortness to compensate for that really long Outkast song last post  -  You know, some interesting things have been happening to me concerning a certain other person.  I dunno why, either.  A lot of it are some really funny coincidences.  -       urlLink take the "what's your dark secret?" quiz   | courtesy of  urlLink mewing.net.  where darkness and secrecy abound.    That is SO COOL!  Though, taking another look at it, it's kinda tasteless.  -  Well....okay!  That's my post.  I hope you have enjoyed this brief time we've had together!
