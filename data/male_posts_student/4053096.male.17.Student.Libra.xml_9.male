Bear with me as I slowly accumulate random information for the entertainment of those like yourself that find joy in reading that which other people write... wow, that's a mouthful. Anyway, like I said, all this is rather new. Don't count on something being written every day, because I most likely won't be able to think of stuff to write that often.
