It's pretty pimping.  Notice the shoes too.  Third of all, that's not my television in the background.  That's not even my house.  That picture was taken at my grandparents' house.  Though, that is my picture in the background there.  Some of those cards are probably from me too.  I give my grandparents cards sometimes.  Then, they let me come to their house in a leisure suit to get my picture taken.  So, children, give your grandparents cards.  Then, you can be hip like me!
