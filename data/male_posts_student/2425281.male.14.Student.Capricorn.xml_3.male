IF Software Design goes well THEN     do 12 units for prelim     do 10 units for HSC ELSE     do 14 units for prelim     do 12 units for HSC ENDIF ...  ... get it?  Anyways... i'll probably do:  2 english (Fobbish me) 4 maths (though i'm not dat gud... = 45th) 2 commerce subject 2 musik 2 physics (2 not decided yet...)  = 14...
