In the morning all of my muscles especially the  Pectoralis major  (check it up if you don't know what it means) was really sore. So I was about to stay home and sleep the entire day but I went anyways. The weather was miserable since it was raining the whole day, plus the Indonesianindoor soccer competition, held a week before independencedaywas not going to happen since no one wanted to organize it. Argh!! Ive been waiting 5 months for the competition. And of a sudden they tell me that they wont have it this year. It makes me so angry >(   But overall the day wasnt so bad. For Hari Anak they always have contest so little kidsage 3-13 can win cheap prizes. One contest which caught my eye was the Hula Hoop Competition. But for this competition they pick anyone who wants to join, so I decided to give it a go. Now I was pretty nervous since I was the only guy above 13 to do it. But because the girl who I think is attractive was cheering me on, I held my breath and focused my energy to my waist so I can shake my   ass   so fast that it will beat the other contestant (who are 7 year-olds) I blew away the competition and I won! And I never even used a Hula Hoop before. Since I won I got 3 kinder surprise chocolate xDWhich I gave 1 to the Anne (the girl who i find attractive). So the whole day i spent with Arya, Anne, and Keke. Just talking and walking around the embassy. I entered another contest, this time a quiz contest. Sadly i came 3rd place and won a $5 toys-r-usvoucher o.O   What can you buy in toys-r-us for 5 freaking dollars!? jeez the people who organize this are pretty cheap faggots. Anyways i have a history essay due tomorrow. Later days
