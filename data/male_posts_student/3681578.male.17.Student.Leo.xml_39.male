I was pissed off at the related rates question...I was already so panicky that I solved using the rather longer method...  My mind was not functioning well so I forgot the so-called "Law of Cosines" so I solved the related rates problem using simple trigonometry...  More nerdy talk...I got a quadratic equation that works two ways...you can solve it using a variable in terms of the other and vice versa...  I solved it, and it was quite long, for one variable...just before I took the derivative...I realized I should have solved it for the other and so I had to repeat the quadratic formula all over again...  Add that to the time I consumed solving it using normal trigonometry when I could have used the cosine law...shit!  Anyway, Life goes on...I still have a lot in my plate...  1. First Quiz in English on Fallacies...  2. Literature Report for Next Week??? on War by Luigi Pirandello (a not so nice story)  3. Filipino Report for Some Other Time??? on Di Masilip ang Langit (a so-so modernong panitikan story)  4. Midterms in Literature on next Monday...  5. Midterms in Filipino on next next Tuesday...  6. Service Hours as Comelec Volunteer on Thursday-Friday next week???   There...  I am actually feeling fine and comfortable in Filipino class now... (Good for me!) and so much so in Literature...    --Logged Out--
