No longer does ISA go down simply because it thinks the weather is oppressive, or filserver kick the bucket in a fit of fileserving anxiety.  Nope, the network is up.  What's more the pupils appear to be being rather good (or rather cleverer than they were...)  Arp poisoning/spoofing is at an all time low, with one exception.  One of the Ciscos (well two actually, but the other less frequently) flip-flops MAC-address sporadically. The strange thing is, it's between an Etherwan(k) MAC and the normal Cisco MAC. I can't really understand this, I must admit.  Perhaps it's evidence of a baddy, who's to say.  Must look into it at some point (when I can be arsed).  Of course still irritated that WebSense kicks in at 11.15 -- will kick it back if it's not too careful.  And annoyed that the Cisco's switch of entire network segments at that time.  Really not necessary people.  Although there are valid arguments for it, I concede.    So, well done Mr. T.  You're excelling thus far.  Yours,  Pleased network user.
