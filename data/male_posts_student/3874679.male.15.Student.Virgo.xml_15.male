But it hurts when you disapproved all along  And now I try hard to make it  I just wanna make you proud  I'm never gonna be good enough for  You can't pretend that I'm alright  And you can't change me   [Chorus]  ‘Cause we lost it all  Nothin' lasts forever  I'm sorry I can't be perfect  Now it's just too late  And we can't go back  I'm sorry I can't be perfect   [Verse 2]  I try not to think  About the pain I feel inside  Did you know you used to be my hero?  All the days you spent with me  Now seem so far away  And it feels like you don't care any more  And now I try hard to make it  I just wanna make you proud  I'm never gonna be good enough for you  I can't stand another fight  And nothing's all right   [Chorus]  ‘Cause we lost it all  And nothin' lasts forever  I'm sorry I can't be perfect  Now it's just too late  And we can't go back  I'm sorry I can't be perfect   [Bridge]  Nothing's gonna change the things that you said  And nothing's gonna make this right again  Please don't turn your back  I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you  But you don't understand   [Chorus (2x)]  ‘Cause we lost it all  And nothin' lasts forever  I'm sorry I can't be perfect  Now it's just too late  And we can't go back  I'm sorry I can't be perfect    This song is for my Dad. I hope he reads it one day.
