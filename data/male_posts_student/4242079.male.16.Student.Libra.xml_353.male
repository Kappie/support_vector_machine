We had quite a lightning show at Medicine Lake but there really wasn't any power there to knock out. Yes, I went camping! Mmhmm. It was great, really, in a muggy days, chilly nights, hiking, swimming, fishing, campfire, s'mores kind of way, of course. Oh, and a note: there's always a new way to blow up water bottles in a fire.  And now, on to my MST's! I'm putting together a binder of my favourites. They're crazyamazingly funny. Yay! False compound words! x.x  Quote of the day: "Fine! Then stop breathing our lucky air!" -Sheila
