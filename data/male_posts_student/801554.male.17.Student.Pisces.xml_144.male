Not an earthly clue.  2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?  I didn't really watch TV as a kid.  3. ...the name of your very first best friend?  Bryan. Still friends today. But not best ones.  4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?  My mum never let me eat any of the good stuff with all the sugar, so I usually ate Chex. But Chex is good.  5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?  I don't know what I used to do when I was younger, but nowadays I usually poke around the internet and watch Jeopardy! Is it just me or is Jeopardy getting easier?
