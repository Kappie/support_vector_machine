See, english teacher says it 'raiza', so now everyone calls me that isntead of reh-za. so i give it to leila, and leilas like 'hey! whats wrong?' cause she often talks to people a while before she knows who it is, and shes like 'i still have a cold. you know, you sound like a girl on the phone.' and leilas like 'are you on medication???!' and arias like 'is this alex?' lol. it was really funny.  so we talked about homework and how shes holding up afer break up, and her mr wonderufl doll. so i got one of those mr wonderfu dolls at the mall for leila, in her everpresent search for a guy. lol. hey, all girls school life is tough.  right. see you later  aisha is sexy  much love  peace  ~alex
