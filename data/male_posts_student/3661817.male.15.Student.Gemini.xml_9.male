But then once i saw how much my dad liked my gift, it went away. My brother and his girlfriend came over, then we all went out for breakfst. Then we went to the store and my parents and i bought new luggage for our trip to the bahamas (8 days). Er....then i did nothing, just lsitened to music (most of it the new My Chemical Romance CD... i love it). Then i had porkchops for dinner. Hugn out for a bit, then went online, watched tv, and then came online and posted this.  Tommorows my last final for the 9th grade. Studio Art. Going to be easy as hell. Downfall? I have no idea what time my test is...and/or what room it is in. So i have to go to school early to find out when im taking it.    So after that test, im free for the summer. w00t!  I'll post tommorow.  Until Next Time.
