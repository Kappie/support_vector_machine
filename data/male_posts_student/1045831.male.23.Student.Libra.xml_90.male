I would write poetry to wrap around myself to cmfert things in my life.  I hear things about my ex girlfirend that I can control the way I feel.  It's embarrising to feel the way I feel.  To know that things are going the way they are with my ex.  I'm happy for her cuz I love her and hope that she is happy.  Yet I meet girls who are beauitful and they distract me from those things.  I am a sad person and just go to class and get a 4.0 and do what I need.  NO love escapes me or engulfs me because ther is no real love around me.  I love mself but that is all there is.  Love as a misson or an escape.  Thas how I am.  Too bad for me and the way I feel.  Tonight is not goood feelings in my soul.  I love life the way it fills me, with life and love and soul, I feel the love around me, I drink it from my bowl, Like a cup of life, it's filled for ever more, I feel the pain around me, I am the man thats full, Life is pain , And life is pleasure, LIfe I can't describe, I hope I live, to see the day, that I will be the scribe
