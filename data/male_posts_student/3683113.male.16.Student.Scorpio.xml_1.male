It appears in the paper as follows (you can find the opinion piece that I'm responding to  urlLink here ):   urlLink  Page A16, Tuesday June 22, 2004    From Charles Krauthammer's description, it is clear that "Israel's Intifada Victory" is a hollow one.   A war against terrorism is not just a military war. Perhaps the most important aim must be to win the hearts and minds of the enemy. Terrorist organizations need new recruits to operate. But Israel's security policies work against that end by radicalizing the Palestinian population.   Military operations can guarantee long-term security only within the framework of engagement and negotiation. The Palestinian political leadership is rightfully dismissed for not negotiating in good faith. Israel must cultivate and search for leaders it can work with.   Yes, Israel has won this battle, but it will not win the war for its security with its current approach.
