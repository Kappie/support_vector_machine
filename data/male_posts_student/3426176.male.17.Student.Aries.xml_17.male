I gave an average performance, but managed to score a goal.  We played World Cup and I did OK.  I finally ate something at 16:00.  That's 4:00 PM if you don't speak European.  I had to run back out to an Italian meeting where I paid more money for the trips for my mum and dad.  I came home and ate my first meal (Big Mac meal) at 20:00.  That's 8:00 if you don't speak European.  I'm tired.  That's it.  Bye.
