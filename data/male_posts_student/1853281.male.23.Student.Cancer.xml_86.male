Spring break is here, i had been planning on getting my 15 page paper done, however i have done nothing towards it, and shall have to really buckle down now i suppose, don't want to be stuck sunday night...Still walking, still no negotiation with the whole bus thing, strange....wish they would negotiate, am getting a little sick of walking. I enjoy the time outdoors, and i am sure that it has done wonders for my mood, but it has not been the best for my social life, i am sure. I cannot get around.Oh well. nothing really new in my world love and skittles d
