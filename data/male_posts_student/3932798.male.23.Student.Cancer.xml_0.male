Friday night we watched a movie and then she even kissed me. It was a nice pleasant evening. However, it was kind of weird considering she had just told me the day before that she had gone to the bars again with this guy. Now we are not together but it still hurts. Kicker is is that she asked him to go with her this time. I don't think that she is telling me everything about him or her ex-boyfriend before me that she has admitted to liking.   Anyways, Saturday we got into this big fight. She said that she couldn't get over the Ryan situation. (Ryan is the girl that I met and am friends with thatmy ex-girlfriendand I had huge fights and problems over last semester) Well, I finally got up enough guts to tell her off a little. I told her that I did nothing wrong with Ryan. That I have nevercheated on her or have even come close to cheating onher. I also toldhersome other things. Well, she startedcrying. I didn't mean for this to happen but I had to tell her these things. There are many more things I want to tell her like that I don't believe her when she tells meshe has done nothing more than kiss these guys that she has cheated on me with.   Sunday, her and I went up to the Bear Trap Festivalup on Casper Mountain. It was nice...hot though. I got sunburnedpretty bad.   Well, I will try to write more tomorrow.
