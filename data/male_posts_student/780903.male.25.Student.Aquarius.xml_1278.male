I'm looking for something pretty simple --for taking notes at school, using the Internet, probably a CD burner and aquality sound card -- but I don't carehow big the screen is or about anything with an abbreviation -- RAM, ROM, HDTV, PCP, anything like that. Just something that works. Soif anyonehas any nice (or terrible) things to say about relatively cheap, butnot crappy, laptops, let me know. Anyone whoknowscheap places to look, orworks for Dell andcan get me 30% off-- youre-mails are also welcomed. (I've already looked at the Harvard discount laptop purchase page, whichdidn't seem like it was discounted much. Way out of my league.)
