A couple of days ago - maybe it was yesterday, I'm not sure - when it was just getting dark outside, all the electrics went out. Now poercuts are usually not too bad, but when there's so little light that you can't even read a book to occupy yourself, it gets frustrating. There was just  nothing  to do except sit around in the dark, eating and waiting. We got the camping stove out of the loft (involving me freezing my nads off to get it) and we lit a few candles. It was like being in a 1940s air raid, except without all the bombs and killing and fear and all that out frivolous stuff. Anyway, it all came back on about 20 minutes later - horray! - but as soon as my PC had booted up, it all went off again - boo! I phoned up the electricity phone line and the pre-recorded message said that it would be fixed in 2 hours' time - damn. 20 minutes later, it came back on and stayed on; now that's what I call tech support (take note Sony).  Apart from that rather dismal event, this week has been dominated by the run up to Valentines' Day. I'm not expecting anything from anyone, although last year I did receive a card from someone in Wales, although I know no-one in Wales. Hmm... Exactly who "your secret admirer" is remains a mystery.  The week after next is half-term, a 10 day holiday - awesome. I can finaly do all the stuff that I never get time to do, like play console games casually wihtout having to review them, watch the occasional DVD whenever I feel like it because I have time and go into town as a shopper with the aim of buying things! Holidays just seem to get more precious as you get older...
