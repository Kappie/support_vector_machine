More specifically 6 in the bloody morning.  More good news:  We're renting a large SUV to take up there.  Thereby eliminating from this trip the smell of cigarettes that is found in my mom's van.  Even more good news:  I'll be back Sunday, the same day Meg gets back.  Even more bad news:  Meg leaves for Journalism camp Monday for an unkown amount of time (presumably b/t 3-4 days.)  Even more good news:  Then it's two week's till  I  go to to tennis camp.  Even more good news:Then it's a week after tennis camp before I go to Raven Knob and get to pester Mark for what little time I will actually be at camp.  I'm doing RAMPAGE this year, which is basically a bunch of "extreme" activities such as splunking, waterskiing, boating, rafting, etc.  Hopefully though, I'll be able to check my email that Wednesday. *shrugs*  I dunno.    To keep me busy this week I will finish up the troop's website.  Tomorrow night I'll accost everyone in the troop and get the necessary information and take the necessary pictures.  More stuff to keep me busy:  I think my dad wants me to trim the fence line (btw, that = not good)  To recap:    Meg's gone to tennis camp   Thursday I leave for Cincinatti   Monday Meg leaves for journalism camp at UNC   Two weeks after Cincinatti, I'll be at tennis camp (the week before the 4th of July   The next week after I get back from tennis camp (the week after the 4th of July) I go to Raven Knob
