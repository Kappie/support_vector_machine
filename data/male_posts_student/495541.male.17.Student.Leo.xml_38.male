I wish I could exchange some hours durring the day for some at night.  I have to get up at 7AM Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 7:30 on Tuesday, Thursday.  So lifting and running gets done at about 9 then there's nothing to do.  No one's awake because they all stay up until 2 in the morning while I sleep.  Cool... no.  That's about it.  That's probably going to be my schedule all summer :-(
