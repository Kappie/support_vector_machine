Competing with one another and against each other, shooting and throwing (gre)nades frantically at each other (more like at TANKS while on foot... heh), there's no better way to get an adrenaline rush than that! Especially with your mates at the end of a long tiring semester!    Dinner was good. Ate at Laksa King but with a smaller group. Actually bumped into Dawn, Nelson, Eddie and Stephanie (more of the other way round...). Quite surprising in a way cos Dawn called me to ask directions to a place called Raffles Place (no, not the Spore Place). And a couple minutes later, they walk in. Beat that!    Well, last week of hols before I start a gruelling 15 week semester that will be intense from start to finish. Hope I survive. :S Thinking of "preparing" for next semester - going through my surgery notes just to refresh my mind (more like to retrieve what I've already forgotten long ago). Mom's been "reminding" me to do that so I should shouldn't I? :)    To sleep I shall, some shut eye and comfort in my nice warm cosy bed under my soft all-encompassing doona. Shall think of what to do tomorrow... besides sending my prized possession, my beautifully crafted, sexy and gorgeous dreadnought acoustic Maton guitar for a long-overdued servicing at one of the guitar shops in Melbourne. About time I think. ;)
