Thinking on the train home after i sent that ger home.....must a gurl and a guy be always be lovers and not friends?i did asked myself this some time ago, but i didn't think much into it....   topics which went thru my head today -i missed bball~ -i missed 4SE days~ -i missed NCC days~ -the one whom i actually like now -working hard for my results -love commitments -most guys are really !$$##!!^%^, what else could they do beside flirting? -i can't stand gers who think dat they are at a higher class den other gers, and they are damn chio. -meaning of friendship.....  got to know myself better again.... i'm totally emotional....and i'm....easily jealous..and...i'm weak in maintaining relationships....but, i'm willing to sacrifice anything for friends/family for the sake of them....i can't understand why money is placed above relationships in many pple now....*sighz...the world is getting dimmer...  ask myself again .....am i the only one still waiting for the grp to come back...?~!!!
