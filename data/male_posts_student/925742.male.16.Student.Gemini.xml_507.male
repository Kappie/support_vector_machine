And when you see about a thousand lighters in the blackness while Kirk plays the solo to Sanitarium, its a beautiful thing.  Then thursday I dissected a pig.  It was about 20 or so inches long.  Ugh, so many fluids in those little bastards.  I was so hoarse that day, though.  I worked today.  So yeah, I'm out for now.
