My ring finger (thats theone beside urpinky)hurts... :( Was playing basketball today n dis as$ -0!3 went to whack the ball out of my hand and at the same time injure my ring finger!!! So now I cant really bend it all the way or else it will hurt like sh*t and it also looks a bit out of shape... But wth, at least it was my left hand n not my right. Amazingly, I can still type normally! As usual, there's LOADsa homework... Sigh, life is sooo FOS  Oh and I cant wait!!! Canon coming this friday! Tomorrow, we're having the rehearsal and all that stuff.   2 more days to the aquathlon. I hope my injured finger can somehow get me out of it (really hard 2 swim wif a broken finger cos it will keep hitting the water, not very gd at all)
