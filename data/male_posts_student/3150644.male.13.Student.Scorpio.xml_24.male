That is how hard it is to tell the difference.  I'm quite sad. The two people in my line are Jordan and Weiting, who for some reason keeps on getting screamed at by Herman.  Here's what happened on Saturday:   Morning -  had bible quiz training b4 the drill.  L8 morning -  drill practice, drill practice, drill practice.  Lunch -  Leonard predicted that it could have been komala (is that how you spell it?) but instead it was  pieces of meat and vegetable in between two pieces of bread in a styrofoam box  in which the general idea of the compliments can be summarised into the word "rotten".  Afternoon -  THE TIME HAS COME. we thus showed our superior drill to the inferior mortals of the other uniform groups.  Over -  as we marched away, a certain man called Herman was seen walking with two plastic bags. Upon further observation, they were Sausage McMuffins, and 2nd Company plundered the lot. Bwahahahaha.  So that was it. *.*   Coming up:   Top Ten Tips  to remember for smart drill (i.e. BB drill)  01.Make sure your uniform is straight, starched, and the right colour. 02.Polish those boots. Fire and water methods, and definitely not instant shine. 03.Belt - a little brasso is enough. Rubbing is the key.  04.Make sure all badges are present, all in the right position, and not crooked (nametag too) 05.A hollow boot makes the most noise.  06.Straighten your elbow. (Herman used a method - hold two blue cups while marching. Argh) 07.Lock your arms. 08.Make sure that when you raise your leg, it is at 90 degrees. 09. Always "stand straight, chins up, chest out", have a sharp jerk of head when taking dressing, sharp turning during whatever  pu-sing , etc. 10.Remember to keep in line (Quote:"It is very easy to see how you are not in line from far away!" - Herman)  Extra Special Tip: 11. Get Herman as your instructor.
