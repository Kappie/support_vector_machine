Then again, the other people (6 other girls varying age, the youngest of which is around 12 and the oldest must be around 16) have been for a few years probably. Or at least many months. We swam for one hour straight. Sprinting. Ah, very fun; I could barely keep up in the first sprints. In the warm-up we swam an easy 5 minute freestyle..I did better in that. Heh, that's pretty sad saying that I did better in the warm-up. Immediatly following this, we did more sprints, sets of 50 yards. I did alright. I was in the first group to go, and the last to come back predictably enough. Suffice to say, this happened about everytime. I did in fact, eat every one elses bubbles. ;-) I have not yet perfected my flip-turn, so I was slow in turning, I haven't perfected any of my strokes, thus increasing my water resistance and decreasing my speed, and increasing my chances of getting tired faster. Anyone with any tips? I think I just need practice. This is only my fourth day to swim, so I'm doing alright. Now that I'm home, I need to mow in about an hour or two...the smell of freshly cut grass. In the meantime, however, I can eat and take a nap or something. Out for now.
