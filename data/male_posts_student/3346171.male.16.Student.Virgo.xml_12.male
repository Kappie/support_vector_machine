Thank God i had only 4 classes, well,3 classes, spanish doesn't count.  English course is getting boring, it's too easy, so me and a friend- Rose - are going to do a nivelament test, we'll try to skip some classes. Rose is the best, we laugh alot and we talk bad things about everybody. We are mean! But i bet ya that they talk bad about us too. There is this new girl, and she speaking enlighs really confident - when people are learning, they talk really sloooowly and always say " Yesterday we are", or "She like"- and Rose told me to bring her down, using dificult words, hauhauhauhau, and i did, the teacher was talking about computers, and i said something about logging in, and the teacher never had said that world.. and Rose laughed alot...  I'll finish here.. i'm with an ANNOING head ache :(
