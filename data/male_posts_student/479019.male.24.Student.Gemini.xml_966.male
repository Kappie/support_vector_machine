Call my old number for the new number, or check your email (to see if you're one of the special ones to get the email).  Today was a productive day. In addition to the new cellphone thing, I cleaned my room, and did some drawing.  Now playing:  Anti-Flag  - Turncoat  I want to rant on television sensationalism. I was watching NBC 4 News and they had a really stupid story about a Japanese study on how women who eat eggs daily have a higher risk of dying than women who eat eggs a couple times a week (or less). That was such a shitty job of reporting. They didn't talk about what women were dying of, or the demographics of the study. How old were these women who were dying? And of cancer? heart attacks? The stupid story just basically said that women who eat a lot of eggs have a higher risk of dying.   The real story behind the report is that over a 14 year and 9,300 person study in Japan, researchers found a difference in cholesterol levels (3%). However, were inconclusive about the link between eggs themselves and the deaths, because the deaths in the sample were not necessarily heart attacks or strokes. There was only the 22% increased likelihood that the women would who ate an egg a day would die of any cause compared with those who ate only a couple eggs per week.   Now playing:  NOFX  - Flossing a Dead Horse  The correlation between the deaths and eggs is really weak. The sad thing is that the world is full of stupid people, and they'll just think that eggs will kill you.  TV news is just absurd... the most absurd of them all is FOX News. Bill O'Reilly is the ultimate sensationalist. The guy's ranted to a 9/11 victim's family member, and ranted on Carson Daly having a tattoo (that's supposed to be in honor of his father). The guy's invited government officials from other countries onto his show, and not let them speak. He claims that there's no spin to his show too, and people are dumb enough to believe him.  Now playing:  Pennywise  - Society  In other TV news, I'm extremely addicted to watching Alton Brown's Good Eats.  Ok I've got work at 7 AM tomorrow. Nice huh?  ***
