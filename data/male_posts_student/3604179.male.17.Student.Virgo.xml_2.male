I almost died of boredom. I almost jumped for joy when it came back on today at 12, but 4 hours later, I had to go to work. Too bad, couldn't enjoy it long enough. Good thing next week I'll be workin' 12-4 instead of 4-8. YAY! Well I enjoyed it when I got home, and now I'm on the internet again. I'm still recovering from the UGLY game yesterday. WOW, I've had enough of that. I bought my mp3/cd player today, so that's exciting but other than that, my life is boring. SAVE ME FROM MYSELF! Well it's getting late, Hopefully tommorow will be a fun day. I need to get outside and run.   J
