Yay!!One thing I love writing journal is, releasing all the damn anger or writing out my happy/sad feelings, since I don't have one to tell. Another reason I love journaling is, whenever I read back my post, it is fun. Sometimes, I knew what I did was wrong, sometimes, laugh at myself for doing something real stupid, and sometimes admiring my own sentence. -_-" Sounds dumb, but fun.  John did not call me for days. Oh, he did call me up this morning, asked me whether to go out or not. Er, what I mean was, did not call up to talk or something?? No idea. **yawns** I found out something *I think*, I don't put trust on John, neither do him. He dislikes telling me everything. I know, he might want some privacy, but seriously, he doesn't want to share a thing with me. Example, he went Sunway Lagoon yesterday with gm and friends,  , to bring up conversation, I asked him about it today, and he is not willing to tell me. It is very obvious that he doesn't want me to know anything. I don't know. I mean, how are we both going to survive by keeping secrets to each other?? I dislike apology without reasons, it pissed me off easily. I don't know how to explain, but... I don't know!!! Oh, well, I love merajuking, ya know. But, I dislike doing it in front of John, because whenever I *tried* to merajuk, what I get is "Sorry, my fault, my fault" I mean, I don't know, maybe he is sick of my merajuk-attitude. I hate to admit, but I enjoy merajuking to Darren more than John. **yawns** I don't know, I need to find ways to communicate with John... *better* ?? I thought a couple is like, erm, other than loving, is... understanding each other?? He sometimes really don't give a damn to everything and anything I do, and it makes me want to make him give a damn by doing something real stupid. Blek. Darren said he wants to change *again*. And I hate it. So, I admit I do not know the "real him"... But come on, he is making himself lame. -_-" I'm serious, 'cause whenever he tried to change, the difference is very big. I don't think is a need to change, as long as you are happy. Oh well, except for my laziness, although it is happy sometimes for not doing anything. **=P**  Yadayadayada... Brother and sister want the bloody pc again. After this, I'll go upstairs, pack my bag, and check my undone homework.  If  I  can , I might finish it up.  And, I love my current nick name and the corak in this blog. =P Is like, so nice   Will keep this blog update *I think* ::|[MisëräblëPrincëss]|::
