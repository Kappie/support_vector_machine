"It's Still Number Twelve To Me"  (to the tune of Billy Joel's "It's Still Rock And Roll To Me")  What's the matter with the kids I'm taking Are the scores that they have too low? Should I try to hire one more teacher 'Cause we're moving up the ranks too slow? How to raise the judges' score they're assessing, Is hard because the judges aren't doing more than guessing, Everybody's talking 'bout the new Dean, honey But it's still number twelve to me.  What's the matter with the Bar/Bri sales rep Can't we get one who'll make them pay? I don't want the rate to fall any further 'Cause alumni call me up and say: "I saw the latest U.S. News says we're dropping, The check that I just sent you: payment I am stopping" New prof, new dorm, but Dean was caught with kiddie porn It's still number twelve to me  Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers Cause it's only US News that they read If there's a new list in town People gather all around All the anxious feelings numbers can feed As if one school has to be in the lead...  How about we take a few less students? Our rates'll fall and ranking will rise How about we fudge the job percentage? How'll they know if our report's filled with lies? Why did number four become number seven? Do we have a hope of rising one to be eleven? New books, new course, cafeteria's serving horse But it's still number twelve to me.
