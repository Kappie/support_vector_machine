I met up with Angie at Serangoon MRT station and we took the North East Line to meet Debbo at Orchard. And so we did, but since we were early, like very early, we waited for a few trains to pass before we actually got onto one at Dhoby Ghaut. Of course, Debbo was late, maybe by 4 min, but still late. She had a appointment with the barber, and yes, that shocked me. Like when did people start to have appointment with barbers? It's not like if u're seeing a specialist on Cancer or something, but heck. No way me and Angie was gonna go there, and eat while Debbo went for her haircut and later we'd havta watch her eat. Uh uh. So we tagged along and went into the barbershop. Debbo was looking thru different kinds of hairstyles and I was starting to wonder when my friend became Jennifer Aniston. Must style her hair one...whoa. But maybe it's another one of those mysteries a guy may never understand, the mystery of a gurl and her hair. Yea, like...totally chim stuff. And so unfortunately, there were no pictures of Liv Tyler or Barton around the magazines...or I'd have forced Debbo to do their hairstyles...like don't you agree that they are hot? Like...sizzling hot? So, we watched as her hair was shortened, but wait, did it really shorten? Ok...maybe by a tinny winny bit, but still considered a haircut I suppose. I havta thank Angie for the company for that once-in-a-lifetime experience (Yes, once only, never again), or I have no idea how i'd sit through it, even now i wonder how I did sit through it. So that took 2 hrs. Then, we went for lunch at Lido and blah blah...and after that, it was time to head back home  and mug. Debbo said that if she took her watever way of getting home (not sure what it was), she'd take 45min, and boy did she regret saying that. I basically calculated that if she tags along with us, she'd take 40 min only, ah hah! 5 min saved, so she had to tag along. We went back the same way me and Angie came and we walked her to the bus stop. We saw a bus 103 coming, and apparently, there was 103 at Debbo's house, so she hopped on and left. Then, we realised. I can't remember who noticed first, Angie or me, but that 103 came from the direction of Debbo's house. Uh oh, we're in trouble. So poor debbo actually got off the bus after two stops cause it sorta reached a Bus Interchange. She called and told me the bus turned left...like...left?! Erm...left is towards St.Andrews already, there's no interchange there...uh uh. So...later she called agian and said right...talk about a bad sense of direction -.-" We took a bus to sorta find her and got her onto a bus 70 this time, a correct bus finally. After that, me and Angie walked back and on our way, we met a evil organism which i call a Dog. Ok...not the main point, but damn it was fast and fierce looking. So that was sorta the end of the activities outside the house. And I must admit, Debbo is bad with buses. Yea. Okie, please don't hit me for that. So...the 4 day holiday is over...and I guess it's back to school.
