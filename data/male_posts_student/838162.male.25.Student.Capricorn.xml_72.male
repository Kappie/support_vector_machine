However all is not well, for the outcome of the project is very much in question, not the kind of situation that one would like to be in at the start of one's holidays.   There are many reasons why I now find myself in this predictement, "I didn't have the proper background", "I had to learn it from scratch", "I had two other projects to handle". But, as it is for most of life's lessons, I am not without blame for putting myself in this spot. so, as it is for life's lessons once again, I will have to pick myself up again, and carry on.   Which of these is the good part or the bad part, I am unsure.   One thing is for sure though, as I approach the first anniversary of this blog, it looks like my plans to move to a new web host would have to be put on hold. Life lessons are rarely without a price, so finances are going to be tight for the next few months.  Something tells me that I should just focus on posting regulary.
