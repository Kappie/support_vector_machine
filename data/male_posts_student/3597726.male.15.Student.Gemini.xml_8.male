Probably in her early twenties, with problems. I guess she'll play one of those classic 'Peter Parker' roles just with a better life situation. Yeah. Anyway, she's able to see other people's future. Anything's future. As simple as reading a book.   Well, as you may have guessed, no one really believes her except for a few close friends. She tries to prove herself but can't. Somehow, she'll mess up something big by trying to save the city from a catastrophy and gets in trouble with the police or something. She gets found out by someone else from another place...  Anyway, I have to run, literally. Kates coming over real soon and I haven't showered or anything...
