With that said, I have two things I would like to talk about.  1. Cops 2. A conversation with a friend during halftime.  1. My friend and I drove to downtown Detroit after the game and what angered both of us was how the DPD shutdown all the exists into downtown and even closed some of the main arteries leading into the city. It is one more reason why I hate the police with such a passion. Here was a chance for Detroiters to come together as a city (in the physical sense) and the police did not allow that. That makes me so angry!!! Not only do the police protect the rich and powerful, but now they do not let everyday folks come together in their own city--so much for the land of the free. I will admit after some backstreets we found our way into downtown and found it packed with cars and energy, but little foot traffic considering the Pistons won the NBA Championship. And of course the media was reporting that not much was going on in the city and focused on pleasant Royal Oak.   2.  I had a conversation with a close and very loved friend in New York City. I just wanted to reflect on it because I value the time I get to spend with him--even if it is over the phone. He is someone who I respect and admire for his dedicated work for a better world, as a human being, and as a free spirit, and he is a comrade--an anarchist like me. Our conversation was another reminder of the heavy price so many activists pay for their dedication to a better world. After  years of paying attention to Iraq, civil rights, capitalism, and all sorts of other issues, he--like myself--is paying attention to his needs and is piecing his life together. Do not get me wrong, I do not want to sound as if activism does not have its rewards. Being involved in the struggle has been one of the most beautiful journeys I have known. But it is none-the-less one with its price. Khalil Gibran said it best, "  The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain." For all the sadness that has fell upon my friend and myself, it has only carved a larger container for us to hold our happiness in.    I will pray for him tonight that he finds happiness in all the decisions he makes. He has earned it.
