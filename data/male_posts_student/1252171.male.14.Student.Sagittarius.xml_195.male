It's suppost to be a really really really good episode tonight, so I want to see it! *Bonks head on desk a few types to relieve hyperness.* Ow. Now I don't know what to do. I don't wanna do the stuffs I did already, dang it! And I know I'm not familer enough with Gage's charctars to write short stories and stuffs! AAAAAHHHHH!   *Space monk monkies attack again. This time they seem to have a new ally. S**t, it's Mack! And a pathetic, in a bad way, robot of his. Beth tries to run to the door, but the monk monkies have the room surrounded! "I need help!" she screams. And some one comes to save her, but who? Tune in next time to... What the Hell is This?
