Nima was really nice and gave me his jacket when I was cold. Tried 3 times, but we still couldn't win the cute stuffed doberman I wanted. Blah! It was totally cute though. Oh well. So anyways... it was okay. I got a huge headache from being carsick and also ride sick. The wind blowing against me and my head going against the restraints really gave me a big headache. At Bethel, I didn't feel like doing anything. Spent some time in the stairway with Vivo, Erica, Zoe, IngiEE, Candace, and Mark and we just talked. Nima was inside playing basketball the whole time. Then we went inside and I saw Nima on the stage so I went beside him. We just sat there for a while and he helped some girl with her guitaring. I only sat and watched. Then he went back to play basketball before I got the chance to talk to him. Whatever. Jason came over and sat down beside me and we talked for a while. He's a very pokey person! Haha! He kept poking my cheeks and IngiEE's cheeks. Haha! Funny guy. He has this baby-ish voice and it's really funny. Blah. Then Jason took a pic with me using his cellphone and also with IngiEE. Haha! It was a lot of fun talking to them and messing around. Made my headache go away. Got me a little hyper. ^^   Nima stopped playing basketball and played some piano. I was gonna go and sit beside him to talk but I didn't think he'd want to be disturbed when he played the piano so I just let him be and continued talking with Jason and the others. Haha... he needed gum so I shared my last 3 pieces of Bubblicious with him and some girl. Exchanged MSN addresses. BlahzZ~! I didn't really get to know him until tonight. We talked a little and he's really fun to hang around.   I missed Nima and really wanted to talk to him and just take a nap on his shoulder but he was always busy playing his basketball and piano and crap so I just let him do his thing while I talked to the other people. So tired... Too bad... maybe I'll get to talk to Nima some other time. Whatever...  I'm so tired but I don't want to go to bed. I miss him. I want to talk to him a bit before I go to bed but probably won't get the chance. He'd probably be in bed, playing CounterStrike, on the phone with Alice/Jordan/Erica, or playing with his guitar. Blah. I don't know why... but I always like talking to people. It just... is. I like talking to my friends, with my close friends, my best friends, anybody and everybody. I just wish Nima and I could talk more... I find that talking relieves the tension and awkwardness between people. Whatever. He and I will talk when he wants to talk...  Hmm, saw Aaron today but didn't really talk. Saw Derek and Brian too... Why was Mich, Derek, and Brian all there but not Auntie Amy? Her children are there but not her... Nooo! Haha~ I miss Auntie Amy most out of all of them.   Hmm, almost forgot... Lisa's back. I had a huge headache and wasn't exactly feeling the greatest while talking to my friends in the stairway. All of a sudden, I see someone pull some luggage thing into the place where we were and I saw her. Lisa. At first I thought I was hallucinating from being so dizzy 'cos Lisa was supposed to come back in September or whatever! Oh well... I missed her so much. One of the people I trust most. I tell her everything... Or used to. She was really busy in Texas so yeah. Well she came back early. I hope it's not a bad thing like getting kicked out or whatever. *sighzZ* I doubt I'll get to talk to her a lot anyway... she'll be really busy talking to everyone who also missed her and stuff.   Nima had his arms around me most of the time at Wonderland and I could almost still feel them there. Haha! Iunno. Weird. My mind keeps going back to Nima. See?! No matter who I'm with, where I'm at, or when it is... Nima's on my mind. Can't get him out. Don't want to get him out. Like I said to him today, "I could lose as much money as I want, or lose anything... but I don't want to lose you." I love him... I just hope he realizes just how I feel for him. *sighzZ* Whatever. Too tired.   I guess I'm going to go take a shower now... gotta post this on both SD and LD... Bye~ Goodnight and God bless y'all. Fuck.
