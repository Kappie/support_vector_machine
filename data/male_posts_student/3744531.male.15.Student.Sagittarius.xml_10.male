They do this often, especially in warm weather when a cool breeze on the belly would feel nice for anyone. On some occasions your Alpaca will be so lost in his own little world that you can walk right up to him before he will jump to his feet and run away.   Bouncing  You will occasionally see your Alpacas bouncing around the paddock, lifting all 4 feet off the ground at once with their tails held high.  This is called "stotting".  Cria's in particular enjoy to stott and chase each other around, but adults will also join in the fun. This activity mostly happens at dusk and is very enjoyable to watch.    The Sulk  When alpaca's get upset they will  "drop their lip".  The bottom lip will become all droopy and fall away exposing the bottom teeth and gums. Some alpacas will take pieces of hay, grass or leaves into their mouths and just hold it there for extra effect. Saliva will sometimes drip from the bottom lip as well.  If all this sounds rather pathetic, it is.  They are sulking. Don't worry about it. They have probably just come off second best in a disagreement with another Alpaca and they will get over it in a few minutes. (Often the sulking Alpaca will have a few globs of green spit on their face as evidence of the disagreement!)    Dust Baths  Alpacas love to roll and they will line up and wait for their turn. There will be spots in the paddock which become bare patches over time. And yes, if it's been raining, those bare patches will be mud baths - they roll anyway!   It's Mine! All of it!  Alpacas don't like sharing their food, so some of them will sit on the hay to stop the others from getting it. If a handful of tasty food has already been offered to an alpaca, it becomes second hand and no one else will want it.   Sticky Beaks  If you are doing some planting, fixing a fence or just messing about, it won't be too long before you have an audience.  Alpacas like to know what's going on and more often than not they will all be there lined up along the fence checking out your handi-work. Likewise if you leave an item in the paddock when you're finished, a tool or piece of clothing, each alpaca will ensure the item is thoroughly looked over, sniffed and tasted before being delegated to their "boring items" list. They will revisit the item every now and again.   Water Babies  Alpacas like to keep cool when it's hot.  They will dance in a sprinkler or dunk their feet in a water trough.  If the water trough is big enough or if you have a dam - they will sit in it.   Hum!  Alpacas have a unique language. When they are moderately concerned about something they hum.  Alpaca Mum's hum to their cria's. An Alpaca who sees or senses danger will sound the "alarm call" which is a high pitched squeal which sounds like a cross between a bird and a donkey! It is impossible to ignore. Male alpacas "orgle" at females - They blow their cheeks out and sound like they're gargling.   Hit and Miss  Alpaca cria's like to play rough and will test their mums to the limit. A favourite game is to be far away from mum, turn and run straight at her at top speed.  The mum's nice soft fleece means a easy landing at the end for the cria. The mums tolerate this game quite well. A cria who chooses the wrong mum, though, will receive a face full of bright green spit for his trouble.   Super sleuths  Grown alpacas like to play detective and sneak behind you. You know they are doing this because you can hear them, but if you turn suddenly, every alpaca will be head down grazing or looking off in another direction just so you won't  know they were following you.  Males check out the dung piles to see if the females are pregnant.  He will put his nose right into the pile, inhale deeply, roll his eyes back and then throw his head straight into the air arching his neck over his back. He will do this several times, snort and then either go for the girls or carry on grazing (depending on his analysis)this is very cientific. They're usually right too!
