I'm constantly singing (and playing on the piano) Hallelujah, from the Shrek soundtrack. I think it's by Rufus Wainright, but whoever it's by it's cool. So I keep singing it. I've just got hold of the lyrics, and I now know I've been doing it wrong, but who cares?  Lennon IS BEING AN ARSEHOLE so my blogging is being done here, at the library. Woohoo. Meep. I liked Lennon. Now it's really being annoying at me. It should revert to its previous stage of being nice.  Oh, and the song I have chosen to get together for Tom's band is.... It's A Kind of Magic. I have the chords (which appear to be incorrect) and the bass tab (which appears to be incorrect) so it's all going smoothly... yeah...  My belief is that Sam is at Brownie camp, which makes it harder for me to drop her birthday present round. I've been meaning to since the 23rd, when I got back from Stanners'.  Meh, she can have it when she gets back, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. It's only a bracelet...  Zoe's not on much anymore... or at least I always miss her when she's online. One or the other. Well, she could have blocked me but I don't think I've done anything to warrant it so I'll try to not be paranoid about that.  Suz is coming out of the "Loony Bin" (as Marcus and Suz both call it) and so she'll be on my computer a lot. Caedmon isn't connecting for some reason, so she's having to use Lennon and basically it can't cope with me, never mind Suz. Oh well. Gwen's using it a lot, too... it's a lot of strain for the old guy.  Anyway, I don't know when I'll be able to blog again.... Ooh, I'm going round Sarah's tomorrow. She just randomly asked me... Iao, I'm a bit nervous about the whole thing but I'm sure I'm just being paranoid... yeah...  Peace, Jon Roskilly
