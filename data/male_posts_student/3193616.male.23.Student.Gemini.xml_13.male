The bench instead of viewing this as a settled matter just because she has declined to accept the post of PM nou, should have taken a view of the future.What will the honourable bench do tomorrow if she again tells that "My innner Voice tells me to take up the Post of PM". Will there be any one to Protest the decision then?. I hope the bench will reconsider its decision sometime. It is unfortunate and the lawyer is pitiable to have shell out Rs.30,000 for the petition.
