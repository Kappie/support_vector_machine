Anyway, I still stand behind my opinions on the Powerpuff Girls, but I aplogize to anyone who was offended.  However, if you know me, you should've known I was going to be an asshole.  I just saw that commercial for their movie, I pray for the minds of those who go to see it.  I lost 40 of my brain cells just from that trailer.  I think I'm going to far into this again.    So far I have 50-something hits, but if you take away all the times I checked on it, that would make 30-something.  Take away the times people kept leaving and coming back, maybe around 17.  17, feh, good enough for me.  Thanks everyone.  Speaking of bad movies, I just saw the trailer for The Country Bears.......  Disney is low on ideas.  "Based on the popular Disney World (Country Bear Jamboree) and Disneyland (Country Bear Playhouse) attractions, this is the story of Beary, a 10-year-old bear (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) who's been raised by humans. When he discovers his roots, he sets out to Tennessee to find his family, only to discover that the famous Country Bear Hall is about to be torn down by a greedy banker (Christopher Walken)."  How much acid would I have to drop in order to not tear out my eyes and throw them at the film projector?  Of all the shitty plots to come up in my lifetime, I never thought I'd live to witness Walt Disney turning in his grave...  Please tell me who sickens you more, Lil Bow-Wow or Lil Romeo?  I still have no idea how to put a mailto thing on my page, please help.    Go America.........You ruined the violent fairy tales......
