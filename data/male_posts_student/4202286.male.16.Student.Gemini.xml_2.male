ATMs some of them are. bought over 70bloody$ worth of books. but with the disc and vouchers. it shrunk to 56$. wow to that. i spent in 4 days as much as i would have spent in 3 months. wow to that. now im hooked to Family Way(tony parsons) and SkinnyDip(nothing dirty about it.except for the storyline.get it?)  someone wrote on my SkinnyDip. im gonna hate whoever wrote it.
