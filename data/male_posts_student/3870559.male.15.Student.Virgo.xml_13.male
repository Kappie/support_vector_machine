"well its a good thing that u would b there...i know alot of guys that wouldnt do that" "i woudnt do that for most girls cause they tend to b bitches...but ur different then them" "is that a good thing?" "yea.....ur not like them"  i dunno if u guys would understand that....but when we were talkin...it was soo sweet....just thinkin about how i might not see him for a while....that really tears me up....it makes me upset....especially since he didnt call me b4 he left...i really hope he does call me...and soon...cause i could use the pick me up....well later!
