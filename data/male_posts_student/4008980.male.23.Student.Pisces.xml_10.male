My one reader may be disapointed, but this post isn't going to be about politics.  In fact, I don't know what it is going to be about... gimme a minute to conjure up something.  Well, maybe it wil be about politics. Sort of.  Here in the Twin Cities (that's in Minnesota, USA, sid), a bunch of the local governments have passed or are waiting to pass smoking bans. To this, I say boo. I'll admit to being an occasional smoker. It's relaxing after a tough day of work, and it seems to fit while throwing back a couple drinks with friends at the local bar. I know it is bad for me, but lots of things can kill you. Everyone has a timeline. I'm not saying that anyone should be subjected to secondhand smoke if they don't want to be. The right to breathe clean air is a civil liberty. However, the right to go to a bar and smoke is also a civil liberty.  Like many things, secondhand smoke is fairly easy to avoid if you want to avoid it. If you don't want to eat french fries, you don't go to McDonalds. If you don't want to get mugged, you don't drop by the ghetto at 3 a.m. If you don't want to lose all your money, you don't invest in Enron. If you don't want to deal with secondhand smoke, you don't sit in the smoking section, or you don't go to the bar. The no-smoking thing at bars really kills me - it's like saying OK to killing your liver and drinking and driving, but that secondhand smoke... no way, man.  Minnesota recently caught up with the rest of the world when they extended their bar-closing hours from 1 a.m. to 2 a.m. Now, the later closing time seems to have been a kiss on the cheek while local governments were preparing a kick to the groin.  You know the old saying "one step forward, two steps back"? Well...  I have more to say, but the words are eluding me this evening. My next post will be about cheese, I promise you all this.
