Its not an easy book to read and I've taken about 2 months to finish it - but I must say the effort was worth it. I am not super good as far as mathematics is concerned, never was infact, but I do appreciate it a lot better now than I used to. But the book just bowled me over as I came to realize the sheer genius of the man (John Nash). I've had a chance to see the man for real, when he came to Delhi for a game theory conference. He seemed a mere shadow of the character which Russell Crowe portrayed in the movie. But the book taught me so much more - he has done some phenomenal amount of work and I only thought he did his Nash Equilibrium and non cooperative games stuff ! 
 The book is tragic, inspiring and heartwarming at the same time. Kudos to Ms. Nasar for writing some great stuff. Anyone who's loved the movie ought to read the book and do not let the maths deter you - the spirit and courage of the genius which shines through the book will help bridge that gap ......
