I start back to classes on Monday, but I'm really glad I had this chance to refresh and catch up with myself. I've already mentioned how it snowed on Valentine's day. That was really cool. On Monday I had my public health class; nothing special there. Tuesday was pretty cool also. I got to work during the day for a home health service called Amedisys. Home health care is a service provided by Medicare part A, so being the health policy student that I am I had a great  time learning how home health works in Fort Worth. There's actually a lot of politics and economics that goes into home health care, which makes it that much more interesting.  Tuesday night I had about 5 people over to my apartment for dinner. I really spent way to much money on dinner for everyone; basically about a week's worth of food for myself was spent in one evening. I can't be doing that kind of thing often. It's time to tighten the belt a little.  About a month ago I learned that my Duke sophomore-year roommate, Alan Billharz, was going to be in Austin, Texas for a few days on business. On Wednesday I drove down to Austin to meet with him and three of his Microsoft coworkers. I had a really good time there. I got to stay with them at the Driskill Hotel (quite nice), I got to have a really good rizotto verde at this one Italian place, and we got to listen to a really good local band on Austin's 6th Street. I only really got to hang out with Alan for a handful of hours, but I'm very glad I made the trip down. We got to catch up on lots of things; I really hope that I get the chance to get up to Seattle sometime.  Thursday I went back home, and Friday I got my eyes checked and talked to Jake Woods for a few hours. Today was a beautiful day to go running...and that just about brings me to right now.  I've got about 3 weeks before I return to Duke for a few days. I think while I'm there I want to try to do a lot of things that I never really got a chance to do: I want to revisit the Duke Gardens, lay out on the main quad and read the Chronicle, run along the Washington Duke trail and completely listen to my old friends without having a timetable running through my head. Those should be some good days.
