The time is 8:45am... She says, "I am going to get my contacts from the contact area. I just nod and she goes on.. meanwhile I take the glasses back for the lab girl to get started on them.Still yet I go back out and start talking to a co-worker about the previous day and about 5 minutes go bye when the same woman walks over and plops her ass down in front of us. I ask if I can help her again, "Can I do something for you?" she says, "Yes you can bring me my glasses.." The girl I am working with says, "they aren't done yet mam.." (keep in mind only 5 minutes have gone by) she says, "I brought my glasses and gave them to this young man (being me) so that they could be put in , in a timely manner and I can get out of here! How long can it take to take lenses out of one frame and put them in another!!! What do you mean they aren't done!" I say, "Mam the lenses come in and are about 5 inches across.. they have to be traced and then cut down on the edger, sized and verified for the correct prescription, angle and defects. This usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes.." she yells, "WELL!! I didn't know that! I guess I'll have to come back later!" she then stomps off and leaves. My coworker and I look at each other in disbelief of her rudeness.  AHHHH!!! (pulls hair out)
