I discovered this is quite true by sleeping 11 hours last night. I would have slept longer had I not been required to get up because of some stupid bike practice.  Speaking of the bike practice: 1. The coach was almost 1/2 hour late, and didn't say "sorry I fucked up and delayed the ride", nor did he say anything that included the words "I'm sorry" and "late". 2. The ride was painful. Painfully short that is. I wanted to go faster than a leisurely pace, and longer than about an hour. The reason (no, I'm not talking about the new Hoobastank album) was, "some of our riders were tired from racing yesterday." I've had to race and then ride the next day, so get over it! 3. There was a potluck. There was lots of food. I ate too much, with nothing else said. 4. I think I may be switching teams, because I'm so f@#%ing sick of poor organization, or the lack thereof. I hate starting the season late. I hate missing season opener races, which results from the late starts, which results from the shitty organization. Everything the coach says turns into a pile of "no development team...will be development team...sort of...comp team only practices, but others invited..." W.T.F? 5. The coaches lost everyone's orders of jerseys and shorts, so everyone has to pay again. WTF?!? 6. I don't really know anyone on the team. No one to talk to, really. And we all know how terribly anti-social I am...  So this is what 11 hours of sleep plus unorganized bike team coaches can do to you huh? Turn you into a pessimistic asshole, thats what. Well, more like excedingly annoyed and angry. Maybe I can switch to Andrew Kotz's team. Then I actually know somebody that I used to race with. And I hope to God that team's more organized than mine.  Oh yeah, and now I'll close with the lyrics of something I wrote today: fuck lyrics in blogs for today. lol, no lyrics today. If you want to know a song I like, I'll give you song A by band B, nothing else said.  A=The Reason B=Hoobastank  Like I said, nothing else said. Oh, and you're welcome Dylan and Amelia.
