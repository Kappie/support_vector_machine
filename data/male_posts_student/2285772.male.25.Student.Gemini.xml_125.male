Anywho, I live in Mapleton, study at BYU, work in Spanish Fork, love warm weather and love playing a good round of golf. My 2 favorite bands groups are The Beatles and CAKE. My favorite quote is probably, "Ability may get you to the top, but it takes character to keep you there." John Wooden. By the way i have an exciting new blog of my own.  urlLink www.tory1996.blogspot.com
