I could have gotten a better head start on it if it weren't for the fact that I was busy studying another module which I though would be having it's exam around the same time, only to find out that it's a non-exam module.  grrrr . Wish they had told me earlier. Yes I know how it can seem unusual, but I assumed that all modules had exams and wasn't told otherwise at the beginning on this one. Yea Whatever.    >   Downloading the latest  urlLink Matrix Reloaded  trailer now.  Rocks!  I can't believe that it's almost a month's time away. Seems like I've been waiting so long for it. It almost seems a lifetime away seeing as how I had enlisted, lived overseas and gone through a relationship during the time since the first movie.     >   Picked up the highly acclaimed PC game  Battlefield 1942 . It really ups the ante on first-person online multiplayer games with the biggest feature being seamless interaction with vehicles and defence placements. Didn't have time to spend too much time with it but I did get a chance to try out the Desert Combat modification which updates the game to modern day headlines. All in all a pretty cool game, but my interest in it seems more on it's innovations than it's gameplay.    >   Now that  Smallville  has ended it's first season run, Channel 5 is bringing in the sister series  Birds of Prey  in the same timeslot. It's from the same producers of Smallville and is also a twist on a DC comic, in this case  Batman . I realize that I may have spoke of it before but since it's actually coming to our small screens this time I guess a recap is in order. Basically it is a strange combination of the Batman movies, animated series and comics. In BOP, Batgirl is Batman latest partner after Robin and Nightwing left. On top of that, Catwoman has reformed after giving birth to a girl, who turns out to be Batman’s daughter. The war between Joker and Batman reaches a tragic end and the series picks up in the aftermath of that event. The whole thing is linked together by the visions of a young meta-human (think mutants in X-Men) who has traveled to Gotham City. Keep an eye on actress  Dinah Myer  who plays Barbara Gordon/Batgirl/Oracle. She plays the role very well and true to the comics, it helps that she is quite a knockout too :)   Well, hopefully It won't take me another 10 days to post again. heh.
