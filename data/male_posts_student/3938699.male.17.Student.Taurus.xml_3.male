It starts off with that strong pain in your stomach at the very sight of the person. Then the adamant hatred and malice. Shortly thereafter, was the 'I desperately need a warm body to fill the gap left behind'. Now it's the, 'life is life, now its up to me to live it'. At the current rate, do I wish I never met her, yeah. But who knows, she may have taught me a valuable lesson I have yet to learn, or sown seeds that will inspire me to find my true companion. But because I do see time as a four demensional spectre, I'm pissed, and wish we never met.   Time for me to live life again. Jake got back today, well... I guess yesterday, I've been lanning for almost 10 hours, so the whole time concept is blurry right now. Jake is really the only person I can sit down and talk to about this whole catastrophe. Who else? My parents, haha. Samantha, why would she care? We're mavericks as he once said, he shall help me brave this storm, and I him.   I hate uncertainty. I hate not knowing what comes next, or where to go with this. That's why I can't stand those who are smiling one minute, and stabbing you in the back the next. I'm okay with assholes, but shifty assholes, I cannot stand. I wish I could peer into the future and see that everything will be okay. To see that I have conducted my journey in the best possible way, to see that I will not be alone forever.   I was talking to Dave (youth minister), and he asked me, 'what one certainty is there in this world, what always is always?'. After thinking for a couple of seconds, my answer was, 'death'. Life is always followed by death. That is the only certainty I have. No guarentees were made to me at my conception but that one. No one told me I would get married, have kids and live a happy life. Only that my life would be followed by death. That I suppose, is the nihilist point of view. Where I differ from the seemingly pessimistic and apocolyptic fate that nihilism describes, is that I have no fate. No one guarenteed me a happy life, or a beautfiul wife. Therefore, I must be the reaper of my own fate. I must control my actions, not submit to temptation. May I have strength to carry on.   I once described my journey as a walk down a road. Something set and simple to follow. I was in error. I am lone on a small raft, floating in the torrents of life. Temptation, hatred, doubt and fear all crashing against the few logs I've put together as my life. I will be strong, I have enough strength to defeat these waves, to brave this tempest.    He sheaths Xylothin and looks out into the endless abyss, witha smile...
