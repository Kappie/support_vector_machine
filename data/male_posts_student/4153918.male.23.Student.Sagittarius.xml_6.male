He wasalso very helpful in arranging for the shutllecocks at the last moment.In addition to the tournament finals, we also had 4 exhibition matcheswith Mr. Biswas and Lokesh(PFM05) who got together and showed everyone howto combine presision placement(Mr Biswas) with powerful shots(Lokesh).Unfortunately, two enthusiasts among the faculty, Mr. A.K. Bhattacharyaand Mr. Amitabh Pandey could not join us today.A big surprise was the appearance of the Director Sir, who came to watch and also played an informal doubles match. It was refreshing to see thatthough he was not a good player he had no issues about playing and wasactually enjoying himself with the students without trying to maintainsome kind of professional distance.Unfortunately, the turnout from the PFM06 batch was not so good. The MRMbatch came out in almost full strength although they had only onebatchmate (Nandini) playing today. Hopefully, the batch will be moresupportive in other co-curricular events.However, Lokesh(last year's Sports Sec) said that he had problems lastarranging matches because of participants not coming for matches on timeetc. We thank all participants for being punctual and cooperative inspiteof the heavy work schedule (and slight changes in our planned matchschedule due to extra classes etc.) and also accepting walkovers withoutargument in case of absence.There was some negative talk earlier about the system used in the draw forthe Mens Singles but since we had no way to seed players we were forced touse a lucky draw system WITH unoffical seeding (grouping the chitsaccording to perceived skill) to try to keep the better players in thetournament till at least the semi final stage. In most tournaments asystem is used to keep the better (top seeded) players from playingagainst each other in the early stages. To explain more here is notnecessary. If anyone needs clarification on the system used in the lastweek please feel free to contact either me or Ashirbad.Thank you and congratulations again to all participants and volunteers.The results of the last two days are as follows:    SEMI-FINAL RESULTS     MENS SINGLES     Param Chattopadhyay def.
