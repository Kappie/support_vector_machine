I asked him to make me part of his fun, so he did, and now everyone needs to know the truth!  Eric brown is in love with me! he drives past my house everyday, with his lil binoculars(which he keeps in his glove box that i found, he peeks in my windows, he requests from his boss that he works with me everytime i work, he expresses to me how much he loves me and cant stop dreaming about me(not only at nite but during the day as well), he tells me he wants to marry me and spend the rest of his life with me, and how one day he wants a huge family with me! I am telling everyone now! this is kid is crazy! Welp, i have to go, eric is bothering me again! (you know i luv ya eric!!) good nite! -ash-
