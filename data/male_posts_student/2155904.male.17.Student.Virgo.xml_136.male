He got up and has worked on Physics basically all day while watching some college and pro hoops along with the selection tourney.  Kinker came over twice to work on the lab and it is decent.  It has its funny parts which is always good.  Tyke went to Refuge at night with Dotti and a few of her friends.  And Tyke talked to Ekul for a little.  But mainly Tyke has spent his day with Physics.  And is not that near being done.  He is going back now to work more on it and try and get it semi-completed.  So that is how bad his day has been.  He did fall asleep on a chair for a while though.  And then Kinker came over while he was asleep.  That was funny.  Damn physics labs.  This one is a serious stinker.  Ok, here goes Tyke.  Think happy about him.
