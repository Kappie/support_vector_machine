However we cannot set an exact time at this moment since neither of our parents will be home, we will both be needing transportation to the event. I really wish that for once I could get my own ride or my parents could drive people, because I hate asking for rides places, but my parents are leaving town, so there we go.  Capturing the Friedmans is on HBO in a few minutes. Sweeeeeet.  Today, our bus ride was about an hour and a half, and we were all tired, and Jenny put her head on my shoulder and fell asleep. It was cute as hell.  We went up really high in the watershed. I think he said it was about 2000 feet up, but I have no concept of measurements over a foot, so I could be wrong with that. We went to this old growth forest, an area that hasn't been cut down for over a hundred years. It was really pretty, even if the little bugs were annoying. I seriously need to get my camera back from Johnny McBrotherton.  Speaking of brother, I lent him Fight Club to read, and you know what I got? Since Middlesex was really starting to bore me (maybe I'm just not in the mood for it right now), John let me borrow Sarah's copy of Invisible Monsters. Sarah's signed copy of Invisible Monsters. His signature is on the front page. I hugged the book because. And since I'm sure Chuck hugs every book before it gets sent out to the store, I... basically hugged Chuck Palahniuk. So fuck you.  Like the new header? That's all me, baby. All from the mind of Mr. Frankenhauser.
