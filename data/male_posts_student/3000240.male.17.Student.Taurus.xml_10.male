Your vocabulary makes quantum physics, As straightforward as subtraction, Whilst your whole feeble-minded body, Yields to the nauseating tackiness of the whore image, In which you embrace upon yourself with blinded faith.  Ah your stubborn nature is the comedic notion to my ears. The limited thought perspective, Has transparently corrupted the link between your words and brain. The ineptitude of your moral standards,  Would indeed turn Plato in his grave.  Thank God that you exist in the parabola of your own universe, At least the clear minded ones can view your glass galaxy, Each time they flow past your laughable “individuality“, With righteous pity.  xBuBzx
