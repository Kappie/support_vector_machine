The one that has existed for quite some time... or rather feels as such. Basically everyone on this blog plus a few others is what makes up a group of friends that will surely last for a lifetime. Sure there have been some who've been added more recently than others, and some that have faded away, but for the most part, it has remained steadily intact. In the days, weeks, months, and even years, we'll have to rely on our group of friends. Some of us will get really depressed and as a result the others will have to hold on tight and keep on being friends until the happiness comes back. Then at other times, we'll be in moments of pure happiness and ebullience for joy. I am glad to know that I have you all to support me. I appreciate the friendship and shared joy... and sorrow for that matter. I love our inside jokes and querks.  Katie: I love you all around. You give me happiness that words cannot describe. I couldn't have lived my life without you... at least the way I like it.  Sean: You have a way of making me laugh like no one else. You and I can also talk about the world like no other. This will never end. Craig: I appreciate you like I appreciate a day of perfect weather. You and I can find the beauty in things that could be destructive. Our common interests give us a viewpoint that is unique. Ashley: Our past together, though turbulent, is important. Our common background allows for us to bond in a way that only friends like us can. I'm glad we like eachother now. Aaron: You and I come from the same origins. We used to be strangest, most hyper-active kids around. Well... we still kind of are. This commonality gives us a great friendship... though slightly odd, still great. Jacob: In a way, I envy you. Your new start, and your ability to make new friends seems like an opportunity I used to long for. However, you have taught me to appreciate what I have and to always look at the good in life: a.k.a. Katie. Chase: You, Sean, and I started it off. The group of three crazy guys that became a group of great friends. You will always be one of  the  guys. Kyle: As a new member to the group, you haven't had the opportunity to fully experience what Sean and I like to call "The C-wingers." I can't wait to bring you into the group. You are always welcome. Louisa: You and I have had our disagreements, but after some time, we always go back to the laugh-happy friends we have been. Thanks for hating me then, tolerating me a while ago, and loving me now. You are great! I love you all. You are my family. (Sean's the grandma!) Love, Geoffrey W. Nixon
