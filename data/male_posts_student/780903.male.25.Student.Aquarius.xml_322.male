The more-than-slightly-tweaked text of the article:   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A law school graduate who failed to disclose a prostitution arrest should not be banned from practicing law, the all-male Kentucky Supreme Court ruled, after meeting with the student for a short time in their chambers.   A majority of seven justices emerged from chambers a bit dissheveled, but smiling, and lauded the graduate for having "taken appropriate steps to deal with the residue of her early life" as well as "having really nice [assets]."   After an investigation, two hearings, and an hour at the local Motel 6, the lower court's committee had found that the graduate "has not demonstrated the maturity and insight to be placed in a position of trust.  There are, however, other positions she seemed very comfortable in."   But the court said the committee concentrated too much on her past "and not enough on her [assets]."   "Any prospective member of the bar brings his or her life experiences to this profession. She simply brings more experience than most," the court wrote.
