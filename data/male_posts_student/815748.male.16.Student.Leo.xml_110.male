If any of you readers know about such things, take a gander at the source code and tell me if I can do anything to fix it; the code that governs this frame is in the "Blogger Code" section.  MSN Explorer is so cool.  I admit it, Microsoft does make better software than Apple, although this software is at its best when run on superior Apple hardware and in its Apple versions.  For example, Word is really annoying on a PC, but on a Mac, it's much more streamlined and easy-to-use than in its original form, and it beats the crap out of AppleWorks.  Then again, a lot of Apple software is good to, like simple programs that do what they set out to easily and quickly with zero hassle, but for the main programs, Microsoft is a little more capable.  Whoa,   that   was nerdy.  I find that when I can't think of anything to say to people, but they're good people and I don't want to miss an opportunity to talk to them, I end up spouting some long conversation about something nerdy and trivial which reflects badly on me.  On the other hand, for the one subject of mine that's always the most important and most entertaining, I'm trying to kind of become independent in my actions and so il ne faut pas que j'en parle.  Sometimes French is the best way to express something (mostly subjunctive stuff), but most of the time English is best.  Damn, I did it again.
