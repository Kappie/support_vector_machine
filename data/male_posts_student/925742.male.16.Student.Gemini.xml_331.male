Oh well,   WrathS 01 (9:37:36 PM): do you mind if i say he's a douche? PartyOnWayne66 (9:37:43 PM): dont mind at all  WrathS 01 (9:37:48 PM): what a douche.  I hope I don't become a douche.  What else, yeah, not much.  Maybe later I'll go out to the mall and get Kim those tee-shirts.  Maybe drop into Target, too. Not set in stone, though, since my dad's seeing a dying cancer partient today :(  Ok, bye.
