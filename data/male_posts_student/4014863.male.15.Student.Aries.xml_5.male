I have found the first girl that no one has forced a relationship on me or bugged me about incessantly(plus she's cute to boot)! I must thank those who made it possible... brianna who very bodily threw me at her and grabbed my arm and put it around her, as well as telling me she actually liked me too... that was handy that's it for thanks. Other than that i'm still generally alive so to speak and well..... that's about listen to placebo good band..... that's it.
