I say all of that to say that prior to this weekend a night like that would have taken me out of the game for at least two weeks....well Saturday night I drank again.....Houston we have a problem....Luckily for me Saturday night didn't end the same way....anyway next topic  There is something about being a student that causes you to turn every discussion into some sort of debate....  What's the best movie of all time?.....what's such and such's best movie?.....what's better Mad TV or SNL?....What movie had more memorable lines Friday or Coming To America?....on Saturday night all of these arguments were tossed back and forth and then some....I mean we got to the point where we were naming an actor/actress and people would name his or her best movie (in their opinion)....for the record I stated that Julia Roberts is the ONLY legitimate actress of her generation....upon further thought on the subject I feel that the actress in second (Marisa Tomei) isn't even close....there are just some bad actresses out there....what's the deal with that?  Anyway I found a good DVD player for 69 dollars so of course I know have one and a half DVD players in every (non-bath) room in my apartment (only having two rooms that adds up to three).....and I also caught The Royal Tenenbaums....I loved it....highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor that doesn't require a laugh track to know when to laugh....  Anyway's off to handle bizness
