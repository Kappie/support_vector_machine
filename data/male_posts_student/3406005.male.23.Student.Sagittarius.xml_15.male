The entire speech was a re-hash of his over-publicized rant against Stephen Harper. I'll admit it, I laughed the first time I heard the "Stockwell Day with a library card" line. But Brison deserves a kick in the ass for every subsequent time he's used the line.   Some columnist today opined that Brison was cleverly using his time to influence the votes of British Columbians; we still had some time left to vote when Brison mounted the stage to deliver his speech. That seems like a rather disingenuous apology for what is indisputable poor taste. How many British Columbians who a) had not yet voted with an hour left, and yet b) were sitting there watching the election returns thought c) "well! if Brison says so..."   The CBC also managed to snag Brison and Peter MacKay into a joint interview. There is, of course, little love lost between the two of 'em. Lets remember that MacKay whupped Brison for the leadership of the PC Party a few months earlier. Brison may be envious, but I have it on unimpeachable good authority that Scott's animosity runs a bit deeper than that. The two went to university together, where MacKay was a popular and smart rugby player, while Brison was, well, a socially-awkward invert. Did something just snap when MacKay beat Brison for he leadership?   jackass urlLink     urlLink     Also too bad about the Brison win was that a quality Conservative candidate, Dr. Bob Mullan, lost out. This guy was awesome. His speaking style reminded me of Ted Morton's, for some reason.   On the matter of Conservative traitors, on the other hand, we can report that the other character from NS, John Herron, was handily beaten by the Conservative last night.
