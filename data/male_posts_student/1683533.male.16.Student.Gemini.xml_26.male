I don't understand that these preps can go out and buy and outfit for more than 100 dollars, and yet they don't seem to have enough money to buy a damn belt!  So then they walk around all day holding their crotch trying to keep their pants from falling down.  Doesn't that look sophisticated? Then they do that funny waddle, which I love to laugh at.  What confuses me further is how the pants can fall down that far, but not all the way.  I mean the pants are at their knees, are they hanging there by a thread?  I almost feel sorry for you dipshits in the winter time having to cope with the elements with you pants hanging off your knees.   Belts are so simple to use.  Why don't you use them??  You slide it thru the loops on the side of your pants, put the end though the buckle, slip the bar through a hole in the belt, and you are ready to go.   Oh and also, why do preps buy abercrombie stuff and american eagle crap for like 50 dollars each.  It's just an ordinary t-shirt with abercrombie written on it!  You idiots!  Don't laugh at me for going to the thrift store.  Look at yourselves!! I laugh at you cause you all look the same!  And you buy overpriced shirts that aren't even that great.  You get one shirt for like 20 bucks.  I can get a sack of clothes-a whole wardrobe- for just 10 bucks.  And you laugh at  me ??  I hope you don't love your money because you won't be seeing much of it in the future if you spend money like you do now.   You make me sick.
