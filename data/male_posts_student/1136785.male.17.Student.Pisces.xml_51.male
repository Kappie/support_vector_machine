    
       Just finished moving to my new room over in Branford. Pretty fucking sweet. First floor, big room, big suites, and only two people. They ignored our requests for me to stay with my old suitemate the chainsmoking hard drinking korean, but whatever. He was cool, but we'll survive. He got stuck with six other people in his room, so sucks to be him. I wonder if I'll ever see him again in the next five weeks - our scheldules were completely different. Oh well, so long Heejae Yang.   They had us move because of the mass influx of high schoolers in the second session, which begins sunday (classes monday) - from fifteen people to one hundred ninety-five people. I guess I'm going to miss all the people who are leaving from the first session. They were all pretty cool and nice guys. The intimacy was always a plus, as there was only fifteen of us, so we only filled up one housing section. Always hanging out in each others' rooms. C'est la vive. I only took like ten pictures total in the past five weeks, so I'll probably forget them by the time school starts. Only five high schoolers are staying over from the first sesssion to the second. My old suitemate, the two sisters which includes 'the girl' (whom considering she is now housed way the hell away from me and class scheldules, I will also probably never see again), and this one girl who is taking spanish.  Not much else is going on. I have a midterm monday, which is incredibly sucky, as that's July fifth. So instead of partying on the fourth, I have to study for a test worth twenty five percent of my final grade. It's gonna be pretty insane. I need to learn like seventy new words back and fourth, with the only similarity between being that their singular and plural forms are completely different. Also a whole hell of a lot more translations, telling time, all sorts of fun shit. Arabic is annoying.  Speaking of tests, I found out my APs. Let's just say I'm incredibly happy.   I don't think I'm going to finish unpacking until tomorrow for my room. I hope my new suitemate is cool. I also hope/wonder if anyone read that last post I did. Even if no one did, or if the people who did thought it was terrible, I'm going to start proofreading and spell checking those things. That was just embarassing.  urlLink This  guy sure as hell wouldn't agree with what I said, but at least I didn't ignore the foreign based and backed insurgents. It's not like they're exactly part of the Iraqis for Iraq but against the US group. They fall into a much different category. But never say I don't provide alternate viewpoints here.    Boring, yet Important   - Possible bad  urlLink news  for Bush and for America as a whole - Job growth slowed dramatically in June, as employers added just 112,000 workers to payrolls last month, a number that came in well below forecasts by private economists. Bush still praised the report and used it as proof for the 1.5 million jobs gained since August. The Treasury Secretary noted that the Labor Department's house survey, which uses different methods (an exact method is a notoriously controversial to economists) showed a growth of 295,000 jobs in June.   - Preparing/worrying for the future. The US Navy is planning a massive show of force in the Pacific Ocean near China to register a point with Beijing. An unprecedented seven aircraft carrier strike groups will be organized for an excersize well within striking distance of China. Presumably, this is to remind China the US's somewhat undeclared policy in dealing with Taiwan. China currently only has the ability to confront one CGO, let alone seven. If worse came to worse, (depending on the effectiveness of the AEGIS anti missle system) Taiwan may be bombarded all to hell, but no Chinese troops should make it to the island and effectivly occupy it.  -The Federal Reserve has  urlLink raised  interest rates for the first time in over four years. A steady stream of further rises in the cost of borrowing is now likely—unless America’s high-spending, heavily-indebted households suddenly retreat  - Dance you magnificent bastard,  urlLink dance .    That's all for now.
