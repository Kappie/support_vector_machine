And of course, don't expect me to write too personal stuff, people are watching, and one of those people is you.........but blogs are meant to be kept public, for this blog that is, so i won't be asking you to piss off just as yet.........so it would kinda reflect my thoughts of that day, philosophical, spiritual, sociological, etc. etc...............you know.........  Yeah the above post is just simply to fill up space so that i can really view my blog lol...........i'll get some serious stuff posted up soon............
