Luckily today was just the final day for reviewing before finals so all was well and many-a-people rejoiced.  Upon arrival to school I was able to relax for a bit before 4th period started.  In chemistry class today as a fun end of the year activity we silvered bottles.  This meant we mixed dextrose, silver nitrate, potassium hydroxide, and NH3 (Ammonia), and put these liquids into glass bottles.  I brought a bottle of Bawls from home and used that.  So now I have a silvered blue bottle.  Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here,(like Dennis Miller) but glitter is something I cannot stand.  When I am given an invitation to a social gathering I do not want glitter pouring out from the envelope, all onto my pants and shirt.  The whole day I was at school, I was covered in glitter.  It's still there, and later I shall rid myself of whatever has remained.  As the last day of school came to a close, I pondered the great things which would come to pass next year.  Cooking class, Chicago urban history class, international relations class, all good stuff.  I am looking forward to being a senior.  It'll all go down well.  Adios Amoebas.
