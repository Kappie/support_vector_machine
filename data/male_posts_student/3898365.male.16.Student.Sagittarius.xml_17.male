This shows how much of a genius my brother is. He bought a projector with the money he received from family for graduation. When he arrived at  Baker Lake , he ran an extension cord from the power hookup all the way to his tent. Inside his tent, he set up his projector, a Playstation 2, and his stereo. He then proceeded to put a movie in the PS2 and reverse the image on the projector so all of us outside the tent could watch a movie. We watched  Coneheads , which was actually pretty funny,  Finding Nemo , a little bit of  The Fellowship of the Ring ,  Jaws , and Eddie Izzard’s  Full Circle . And it looked really nice. The picture on the tent canvas was just like that of a projection television.       Man, we really rough it when we camp.       It’s funny though. When we were kids my mom would prohibit us from bringing our cd players and our Gameboys and anything else electronic because camping was the time to play in the trees and be active. And now we do stuff like this.       When I got home on Sunday, I went into the bathroom to take a shower. When I undid my belt and dropped my pants, a moth flew out of them. This means that the whole seven hour drive home, there was a moth in my pants.       I laughed so hard. It’s like those old cartoons where someone would open an old box or cabinet and moths would fly out. Man, it was funny.       Oh, guess what? No seriously, guess. I’m not going to tell you until you guess. Fine. I won’t tell you then.       I love my daddy. One of the windows on his   Lincoln   were acting up and his brakes were making a squeaking noise. So he took it into a shop yesterday morning to get it fixed. When he returned home, he was driving a brand new 2004 Ford Explorer. At first I thought he just rented it while they were repairing his car. Nope. He bought it. The guys at the car repair place must have said to themselves, “Hey, it’s a   Lincoln  . This guy must be loaded.” Because they thought it necessary to estimate the cost of fixing the brakes and the window at $14,000. Ridiculous.       But I like the Explorer. It’s pretty.       Holy shit. They actually made a Tv movie about Michael Jackson’s adventures in pedophilia.       Okay, fine, you don’t have to guess. I’ll just come out and say it.          >I finally saw  Napoleon Dynamite !!!!!!! MUAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!  I loved it. The first twenty minutes just had me constantly laughing and rolling in my seat. The comedy toned down a little bit as it progressed, but that’s because they had to make the story all pretty. I loved it.  “Your mom goes to college.”       I think that had me laughing the most. I loved Kip.       My daddy drove, which is why we actually made it to the movie. I had directions and everything.       Afterwards we all went to Elise’s house and played with sparkly glitter glue and inflatable furniture. Really, is there anything else you need?    I love those new Comedy Central commercials that tell you to register to vote. My favorite and yours is obviously the David Cross one. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you sit your ass down in front of the Tv, turn on Comedy Central and wait as long as need be until you see it. I laughed my ass off. Seriously, my ass shot right through the chair and right through the floor into the garage.
