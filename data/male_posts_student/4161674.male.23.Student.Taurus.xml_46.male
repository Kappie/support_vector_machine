I guess the magic happens when you invite people to share the "quick spaghetti". It's the mixture of taste, smell and creative individuals that make a dinner so common, so uncommon.  We asked a few co-workers over tonight on the spur of the moment and with "quick spaghetti" as the main dish - it was the best meal ever. (I'm not saying that because I cooked either.)  Color, warmth, laughter and relaxation. On a chilly February night, the meal we shared became a form of therapy for our family and friends.   It was unexpected, but familiar. The company was family and people we work with everyday, but we learned something new about each person. The two girls - H and Y both 10, got to spend some giggle time eating by themselves at the small kitchen table. They felt comfortable, excited and grown up for the independence of their special seating arrangment. The youngest - N (7) was happy to eat his pasta and bounce between the "grown-ups", "girls" and "the game cube". The grown-ups, L, R, I and T shared stories about family, adventures from when we were young, and concerns for today and tomorrow. The moment was imperfect and unpredictable, but it was perfect and peaceful just the same. It felt like home and it was magical.   Many times I used to pass by opportinities for "Quick Spaghetti" nights, because of the clutter of daily living and my fear of missing the mark. You know what? I don't care about the mark anymore. Martha Stewart dosen't live with me, but if she want to come over for quick spaghetti, salad from a bag and french bread and cake bought from the local grocery store, she's welcome at my house. Because "quick spaghetti" is magic.
