Anyways when I woke up, my mom told me we were going with her family to eat at the Melting Pot downtown. That was the coolest place ever. You like pretty much made your own food. Dont really wanna explain right now. Maybe in my next post. Then Robbie came over and we watched Little Rascals. Did you know Donald Trump is in  that movie. Wow. Anyways, thats the last time I will see him for a week. Got a pimp new layout for the site. Check it out.  urlLink The site   Im out Matt
