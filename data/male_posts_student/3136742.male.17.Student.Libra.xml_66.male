There is, however, another form of writing which goes along with my writing/english as music idea. Just as there are shredders on guitar (the guys with big hair who play a million notes a minute but manage to say absolutely nothing with their music), there are verbal shredders. The kind of people who ramble on incessantly, trying to see how many words they can fit into a simple sentence that could otherwise be shortened to three words, and without making any significant change to the sentence. We are all familiar with Patrick Henry's speech ending in the line "I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death." Notice the simplicity and power of the line. Now take the shredder version:   It would be difficult, if not impossible, to predict on the bassis of my limited information as to the predilections of the public, what the citizenry at large will regard as action commensurate with the present provocation, but after arduous consideration I personally feel so intensely and irrevocably committed to the position of social, political, and economic independence, that rather than submit to foreign and despotic control which is anathema to me, I will make the ultimate sacrifice of which man is capable-- under the aegis of personal honor, ideological conviction, and existential commitment, I will sacrifice my own mortal existence.  (cred. Jacqueline Berke, The Qualities of Good Writing, Readings for Writers, 1974 HBJ, INC) Which is better? The second obviously shows a more extensive vocabulary, but does that really mean jack shit? I'm sure we've all seen chloroformic writing like that before. Hell, I'm guilty of writing like that myself just to satisfy english teachers who I knew to be verbal shredders. It sounds like something Dennis Miller would say. The ignorant bastard! But how much more power the real quote has! Its beauty is in its simplicity. It is truly heartfelt. This shredding business is trying to turn language (music and speech) into mathematics. There is no real tallent in that form of writing. It's meerley a hodgepodge of thesaurical blathering, not art.
