For a start I find the term "computer game guy" particularly offensive cos it sort of likens me to "Comic Book guy" from the Simpsons. Also you probably play games a lot more than I do. You may even have played Manhunt, which I havent. I don't know anyone that owns it and nobody released a demo for it because it was too violent to put on a coverdisc (because all games mags do fall into the hands of youngsters) and also for the same reason it wasn't in any shops avaliable for the public to try beforte they buy. I advoided it because apparently it's really hard, I'm not totally keen on the hard games, sorry to sound like a wuss and all.   As for this story, listen, I'm sorry that your son's dead and all but banning video games just will not solve your problems and as for Dixons, get that game back on the shelves you cowards! I really got annoyed when i heard this morning that they're going to start campaigning for th banning of games like GTA and Doom 3. I'm not going to be buying Doom 3 likes becauce i doubt that this PC will be able to handle it plus I don't have an X Box but i feel that if you're british, have been looking forward to this game and the yanks are still getting it then you should have th eright to be able to buy it. Same with the forthcoming GTA game. I mean you might as well ban films and books as well. Just got you pick up a gun in a game dosent mean you straight away know how to operate one in real life. You can see much clearly how to use one in a film and a book will give a detailed description.   Then theres the argument that everyone has been mentioning, that the game is an 18 and should not be in the hands of minors. Now one thing that I haven't got straight yet, who was it that had and was influenced by the game? Was it the 14 year old boy who was killed? or the 17 year old killer? Even still neither of them should have been in posession of the game, if the killer was over 18 then there would be no one placing the blame on games. And as it happens now, people ARE blaming games when they really should be blaming the parents, which i do.
