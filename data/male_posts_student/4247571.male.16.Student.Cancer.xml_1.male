Went to his house today for his "party" but in fact we just went there to eat then play sit down talk cock lah.. My friend and I bought a G-string for him this year to prank him but when we gave him the G-string, he know what's inside! Wonder which idiot told him sia! But our whole class laugh lik mad lah casue today got paper at school mah. The paper so stupid loh only last for about 45mins waste our bus fare going to school, why can't they put the paper together with another paper since that it only last for 45mins? then after his "party" we went to play bowling and meet another group of friends at the bowling there loh, well I just suck at playign bowling the ball just keep going into the "drain!" So is like throwing money in, but most important, we have fun lah and there's the most important thing. After that, we went for dinner at the food court near by and the food there suck! =X after that just went home together with one of my friend since that most of them don't live in pasir ris. But on our way home walking towards the bus stop, the friend who went home with me saw another group of "gangster" from 08, then he said that he don't want to walk pass them as they fight before then I was like never mind loh walk with him together but only walk to the other bus stop lah not very far tho. This is my day boring eh? I ask them to go chiong they don't want! so no choice but to go went and slack~!
