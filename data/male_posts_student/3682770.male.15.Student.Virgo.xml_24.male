The weather was fine when I left home, but then it started to rain cats and dogs when I got on the MTR. Eventually, it became fine when i arrived at 志蓮淨苑.  I was shocked by what i saw, there were no flowers,  not even one! Perhaps I didn't go there at the right time. Taking a short walk, I decided to leave. Luckily, I found one hiding at the corner.  I taking a few shots of it, the sky started to shout at me. Soon, I returned home.  As I view the picures' enlargments on the computer screen, I realized that I satisfied with one shot only. Anyway, that's enough. I still very happy now as i look at the photo. What i concern is the quality but not the quantity.  Sometimes, satisfy with what you have, you will feel happier.
