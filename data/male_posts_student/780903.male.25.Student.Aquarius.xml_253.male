Sorry I can't come to the phone right now.  Leave a message at the beep and I'll get back to you.  [BEEP]  One Week Before Exams: [BEEP] No phone.  Studying for exams.  Leave a message. [BEEP]  Three Days Before Exams: [BEEP] Library.  Caffeine. AHHH! [BEEP]  One Day Before Exams: [BEEP] Having nervous breakdown.  Talk after exams.  [BEEP]  During Exams: [BEEP] What's wrong with you, calling me during an exam?  Are you nuts?  Do you want me to fail?  Moron.  (pause) If this is a potential summer employer, please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.  [BEEP]  After Exams: [BEEP] Sleeping.  Message.  [BEEP]  After Getting Grades: [BEEP] Was mad.  Ripped phone out of wall.  Voice mail not working.  Don't bother leaving message.  [BEEP]  ...these could be so much funnier, I know... it's just not working this morning... maybe later I'll fix them and make them funny...
