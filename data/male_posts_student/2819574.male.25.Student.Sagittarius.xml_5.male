A fast way to gain help with your application, get the word on departments, help with the admissions process. Now it's bleak place with a few tepid responses after waiting time.  Now the question is, is it just the summerhole (is that an english word, in any case it is the literal translation of a german word describing the absence of attention during the summer months) or did the change in the board structure really cause the demise of it ? I guess one of the big problems they are still facing is their firewall, which basically shuts down all tries to post there....  But then if this board is dead, where did all the applicants go ?  (I guess the lawyers had a different board up pretty fast, but they like to talk trash all the time anyway....but all these econ people, IR, polisci, history..?  maybe I have to google a little bit to find them....
