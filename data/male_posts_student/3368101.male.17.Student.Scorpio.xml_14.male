My chat up lines (I don't have any really) have been compared to those that Victor from BB uses. Not sure whether to take it as a comliment.   Today is the first official day of my holidays, don't know what to do though. I have to cut the grass ina while (I'll do it after I've watched Neighbours)  Also, does anybody have any idea of how you set your phone up so you can email a picture of yourself to your proper email address? If so, please tell.  I'm going to start reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix again today, it'll be the fifth time of reading the book - its awesome.  One has been trying to get in contact with a Manchester born artist, Chris Ofili, who know lives in London, so far, I haven't had much look. I want to speak to him though, I need to ask him some questions regarding my art project, he'll be part of my artist reference.  Im off - going to cut the grass now actually, should finish it before Neighbours is on *hopefully*  Bye.  Currently Listening 2: The Streets - Dry Your Eyes
