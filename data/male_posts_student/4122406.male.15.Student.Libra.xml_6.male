Apparently there was meant to be another thunderstorm today, but all we saw of that was some sporadic rain, and even that was only a little.  Anyway, enough of the weather. Go see  urlLink 'King Arthur' ! Went to see it today, and I promise you, you wont be disappointed. Forget what the critics say, unless they say good things about it of course. Apart from the occasional below-par acting (the young Lancelot for instance), it was a gripping film. Moving, even, in some parts. It's not comparable with either  urlLink 'Lord of the Rings' , or  urlLink 'Troy' , because of the completely different situations, but it was as good as them. It portrayed almost-post-Roman Britain very well, and there were some fantastic scenery shots. Just go see it!  I am in Glastonbury tomorrow. No, not for the music festival, that finished ages ago, but to listen to  urlLink Geoffrey Ashe  speak. In fact, I will be doing much more. I am going with a group of Americans to visit the  urlLink Marian Shrine of Our Lady of Glastonbury . Then there will be a talk by Geoffrey Ashe, one of the world's greatest authorities on King Arthur and Arthurian legend. After a 'light picnic', there will be a tour of  urlLink Glastonbury Abbey  with Geoffrey. I will return in the evening. It will be interesting to see what, if indeed he does, Geoffrey Ashe says about the film 'King Arthur', and whether it is a 'true' portrayal or not.
