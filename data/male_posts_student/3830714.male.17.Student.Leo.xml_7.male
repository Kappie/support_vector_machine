But i don't think she wanna talk to me because she can't go out with me today. But i really don't understand, i mean, i can always finish everything in the morning then can still go out with her. But she refused. She don't want to waste her time in my house. But i can understad, i can't expect everyone to be as stupid as me right? Last night before hanging up the phone, she said she will sms me in the morning to tell me if her mum allows her to go out, and so i waited.   But till 3pm today, there is still no sign of her sms. So i called her house to see what she is doing. We didn't talk much, i can understand why as her mum is around. She asked me to talk in msn instead. But guess what? She put herself as away and do other stuffs. ok, so i guess she doesn't want to talk to me. I can't talk to people when they are doing other stuff, they tend to take a long time to reply, so i ended up staring at screen(like an idiot). I waited for quite some time before i decided to play games(I wanna distract myself, i felt irritated).  After playing for 3 hours, i decided to stop. Guess what i saw in her conversation? She said she purposely come online to talk to me and now i busy playing games! Ya! I purposely play games! That really brighten up my day! Do you know how annoyed i am? I can't sms her as her phone is being sent for repair(for 1 term). I can't even lend her my spare handphone! Furthermore, i don't even dare to call her, everytime i call her, she sound as if she don't wanna talk, unless she wants to call me.  Today was a very pleasant youth day for me. I hope you enjoy yours too. By the way, my sister just bought her first pair of spectacles... Haiz.. she played too much computer games. But anyway, she looks pretty in it.
