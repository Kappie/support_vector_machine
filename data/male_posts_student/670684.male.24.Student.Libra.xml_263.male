No doubt...I want to say that it's more nostalgic than sentimental...sentimental has a connotation of consumerism and the use of tangible goods, while I think my memory is fueled by itself, and not a blue ribbon or scrapbook...but I love books, and I have ribbons.    Campers here.  Fun.  Pretty social.  I don't forsee many problems.  A few folks who aren't too talkative.  Hopefully it's sleepiness.    Five of them went running tonight.  We had a three minute downpour this afternoon, which caught half the camp outside in the torrent, and brought some much-needed cool air into the East Quad, so tonight was 70 and breezy...too nice a night not to be outside.  I sat and read as they ran, cheering them on every time they passed.  Quite stupid.  But they felt better.  I'll do it tomorrow too.  Everyone needs a cheerleader.
