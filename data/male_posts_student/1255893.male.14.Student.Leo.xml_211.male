I spent my time just catchin up on blogs and checking my mail. Surprisingly, no one updated.... or hardly anyone I should say.   This weekend's gonna be filled w/ homework, luckily though, me and Aaron got an extention on our Marine Bio project shizzle. I still gots Korean, Geometry, and CORE to lok forward to. Speaking of core, I got my schedule for next year. Im a bit reluctant to take AP Bio.... I think I might save my APs for 11th and 12th. Maybe take 2/ year. Not too bad right?  Right now Im on my bro's laptop while he holds my PC hostage. I think I geting used to typing on this thingy. Listening to some old Sugar Ray stuff. It seems so old... even if its only from the late 90s.  Im such a whore. Ill be back later :)
