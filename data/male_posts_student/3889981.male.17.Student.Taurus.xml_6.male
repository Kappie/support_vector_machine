Of course that's not my full-time job; I am, unfortunately, still a junior college student (and a poor one at that). But recently I have burnt myself out with all my nonsensical things that I am busying myself with.  The time is 10.40pm and I have just returned from a day spent in the Scout Lore Quest. For tenderfeet (that's the term for non-Scouts), the Scout Lore Quest is some sort of trivia quiz where we pit our knowledge against one another. In the finals there were four teams - Anglican High, Anglo-Chinese (Barker), Raffles Institution 02, and Holy Innocent's.  The first round was nicely done - we had 8 points, sharing the lead with ACS Barker. But it appeared that we had "taken advantage" of the situation - to quote a HI Venture, saying that we had spent more than 30 seconds on the three questions, because the timekeeper had apparently confused the timings for each question - and he demanded that something was done to recoup their losses. (For your information HI was at 2 points at round 1.)  The judges agreed with that suggestion, and declared that round 1 be repeated except that we would not get to take part since we had "taken advantage" of the situation.  By then ACS Barker had taken the lead - 13 to 8.  The end of the quiz came quick - and ACS Barker hadbuilt up a substantial lead to land them the champions' trophy.   We were the 1st runner-up, and though we are satisfied with the result I can't say that I was exactly happy about what happened on stage today.  Well, if life was about fairness I'd look like a Caucasian by now.
