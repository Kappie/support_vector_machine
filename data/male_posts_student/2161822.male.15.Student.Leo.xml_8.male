It um.. uh.. well,.. we wouldn't celebrate it for nothing. After all, even when Christmas is done and over with, we're still in the "Christmas holiday" for at least a good 2 weeks. Man Thanksgiving really gets the short end of the stick. So, what else happened over the weekend. Friday night was ... interesting. I'll refrain from going into much detail to keep from insulting some people. Saturday morning was a waste. Eat, watch TV, sit here on computer...blah blah blah. Saturday night though, my family went shopping in Wilksbarre. Can't miss those holiday sales. "We came here to shop shop shop until the stores close." Well. This should be    hell. Shopping is pointless unless you walk into a store alredy knowing what you want. But enough complaining. Today is my little cousin's birthday. I don't know what to say about that. So I'll keep it to "Happy Birfday little cuz." Well, the Thanksgiving vacation is almost over. Ok I'm sorry to get off subject (well, there really hasn't been a subject for any of these blog posts) but anyone who follows the Knicks : What's up with McDyess? Wow this guy has been injured for way to long and yet he still gets paid. And what self confidence he has : "I know that people think, I'm going to be the savior, but I'm not," McDyess told the newspaper. My prediction is that he'll return from injury, play a quarter, re-injure his knee, and go back onto the injured reserved list for the rest of the season. *sigh* Come on Knicks.  Listen to H.I.M.
