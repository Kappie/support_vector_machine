My readers must now have a Pavlovian conditioning so when I say I spoke to my mother, they cringe in painful pity. It started like that. I wanted to buy a baked stuffed bean burrito from Taco Bell. $1.79 plus tax, so let's say $2. She says I spend too much. Agreed. I spent approx. $400 this summer and have been working less due to Debate and Mission Trips. But it all has been on legit levels. I buy, tops, 2 Slurpies a week (what, you want to bleed me and sell the plasma for that $1.70?). The big payoff (GPS and backpack) was split with my father and we got a 10% discount. Okay, I confess. I bought a Swiss Army knife out of the blue. I so enjoy the multiplicit sweetness of such a tool; it already has proven itself useful (as an opening device). Can't a boy find happiness in a $40 dollar pointy rock with upgrades (Grog started with a rock and the Swiss perfected his design)? Anyways, I think I will cut back. She was right, even though I can never admit it (this doesn't count. Trust me.)  I think I will tell you about the sunset now. I have been a hypocrite: I decry the faults of society and instill them still. I haven't actively gone out to see a sunset until now. And with damn good reason. Been thinking. I've been trying everything to reach God (the fasting, the mission trips, Sundays torture events) by my own power and capabilities. Calvin has taught me that I can't do this without failing (see below posts for evidentiary facts). So I must start relying on God. I still don't fully understand what this means. But I think that's okay. The point is that I'm starting. For whatever crazy reason, today I've recommitted to God. Okay, this is sad. I've recommitted my pansy ass to this Omniscience Being one too many times. But this time it is for real. I considered making an oath, but I fear breaking it and feeling the vengeance of an angry God. But I feared it before and failed. So I decided it was necessary this time. I oathed myself to God. God save my soul if I forget (at least I hope He will. He's good about that stuff). Pray for my pansy,wanker soul, friends. I need all the prayers I can get.  Almost forgot. God has a...well, twisted...sense of irony when it comes to my CD Changer. Hear me out on this one. Here's the song that started the moment I left the beach:  "Simply"- Pillar  I've made it so hard on myself, turning my back on how You felt   Seeing a lie that led me on, leaving a love that did no wrong   That's what it took for me to say   That You simply love   Despite all the stupid things I've done   It's hard to remember   That You simply love   Even though I know not what I've done   It's hard to remember   That You simply love   I've tried to do all this on my own   Not thinking once of what You've shown    All that I've done has blinded me   To everything that You have for me   I want You to know that I finally see   I don't know why I can't understand   I don't know why I can't comprehend
