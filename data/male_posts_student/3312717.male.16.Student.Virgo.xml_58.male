Chris got a  Specials  CD and a  Ramones  Greatest Hits comp. We went to the mall, and Bryce saw Hannah and Kali in the mall and tipped them off to my location. Now normally I don't mind seeing them, but they had a bunch of friends in tow, who made me uncomfortable. Within two minutes of meeting Hannah, Chris picked a shoe fight with her. He proceeded to tell all ten or so people to "fuck off," because Hannah said that he was from Pequot. Then he said that he was Nisswa's finest, that Brainerd sucked, that emo sucked, and that the people sucked. Now these jaded, cynical overachievers were all looking at each other and saying, "Is this kid for real?" It probably seemed wrong for these paragons of sophistication to be among anything real. Anyway, Chris asked if Kali was my girlfriend, and called Hannah and Kali pedophiles, finally making things sufficiently awkward enough to scare them away. I was pissed at Chris, for making it seem like I liked Kali to her, but I really deserved it after the Chris-Bryce "incident." So I forgave him.  I hate it when Chris says shit like that. He does it to almost everyone he meets, and it annoys the hell out of me. It seems like me and Chris have been crueler than usual to each other lately.  So that is what happened on Thursday.  One more thing about Thursday: We were in Best Buy, and John bought a  Death Cab  CD, and a  Coldplay  CD. Now, there are only two kinds of music I hate: emo and indie-snob rock. He said he was buying them for Pammy, but he still was participating in the active dissemination of my mortal enemies. This is shit that  Hobe  listens to.  Speaking of the Hobster, it is his birthday sometime around in this area.  I stayed over at the Oseland house last night. Today, me and Chris and Erik went in to town, went to the Salvation Army, and came back. I got a CD and some books for a really low price:  Brave New World, King Rat , and  The Glory and the Power  all for less than a dollar.  Me and Chris went over to Bryce's house tonight, as Erik was out chasing girls that we had no interest in, and found out we couldn't stay over. So after me and Chris rocked the house with an informal acoustic-electric guitar battle, we left.   Well, I'm heading back to  Spiderman , but I'll try to actually post tomorrow, if I am not busy.   Good night.  P.S.: I bought  Resevoir Dogs .
