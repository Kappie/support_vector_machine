As we join our heros, they're in the process of relocating the Fortress of Solitude (okay, it's just me, but I had to make it sound good). Finally got to see the Seagram's Loft that I might buy today. It's expensive. Hell damn ass expensive. It's also the single most gorgeous house I've ever considered buying. *le sigh*  Gotta work on the final video for work now. it's a little complicated cause we really don't know who's gonna win. The only thing that's certain is that my team's gonna lose. That bites a bit; it's hard knowing you've done the best job you can and it still doesn't mattter.  Cleaned my room today. Guess seeing the vast empty spaces of The Loft's made me think that my apartment really does have space when I don't have shit occupying it.  I'm sure I've got something imperitive to say, it's just not coming to me. For now, I think we should all just visit the  urlLink greatest comedy site on the web.   We're all gonna die. Duck and fucking cover bitches.
