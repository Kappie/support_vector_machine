NSB: (yr10) me, jeff, jono, ben, almo, stanton, york, chi, nathan, joseph, jamie (with sisi). (yr 11) tommy, kelvin, phillip, (yr 12) tim....yes, that 'tim' and some other dudes i didnt know. oh and i think i saw lora wid jamie and co. at burwood station when i left? was that lora? hmm... overall, the fete was interesting. wasn't realli relevant in terms of chrisitanity lolz. it was more a huge gathering. lots of singing. there were three talks, only heard the first two. as doug said, the jumping castle brought back good memories. got my hair sprayed fluoro green...didnt turn out properly though. they had like, soy sauce drinking comps, lemon eating comps, blindfold dodge ball, blindfold wack-a-leader *grins at ben*, RICE idol and a load of other stuff. well worth our time. ^__^ yes...i know, its realli far away for north shore line ppl...but think about it, i am NON-CHRISTIAN and i live FURTHER away than all you nth shore ppl...and i WENT. so you should all go nxt yr. tina and josie wanted me to go spiderman wid them...hmm...but apparently it's not that good? hmm...so anyway. that was that. mum's bday today. going to bondi cos she needs to meet a client. hmmm.... she's getting consumed by her work - which in a way is good - cos she doesn't pick on me as much. lolz. hmmm... has anyone ever gotten that feeling where they have a lot of assignments/work and they still feel bored? i feel like that now. i should go and study for physics and maths and other stuff too...but i feel bored! dude. and then there's the three days of chairing for debates at UTS this week. wow...im pretty occupied. any idea where we're gonna eat before RICE 'where is the love' talk on saturday pplz?  and adro --- i didn't sigh AT ALL in this post! what an accomplishment. keke.
