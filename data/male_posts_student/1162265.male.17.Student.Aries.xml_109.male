It was pretty hard to think of stuff for a kid with ESP to actually do.  So I put that idea on hold and started to write  The Day before Armageddeon  Really bad idea, if only because I can't invent an entire danm setting for all my characters and since this story is supposed to take place over 200 years in the future it had it's problems.  So now I've got a third idea that I really like with a mix of things from Neuromancer, and numerous other sources.  I considered making a "not to distant" future setting with people dying in the Matrix, and having their souls linger, but then I thought of something cooler.  Using my interest in the Occult could give this story a unique edge.   My general overview for the story would be a small business figures out a scientific procedure that reduces astral projection down to a science.  This makes it possible for nearly anyone to project themselves, but at the same time opens them up to long explorations of the Astral world, which isn't what it seems when the realize they are only touching the surface, which is full of only emotions. Long and short of it, is they discover that "below" this world of emotions lies land of the dead of sorts.  It's a general Pandoras Box theme, I guess maybe a little bit of horror.  It has some potential, but I really need to flesh out this "astral world" idea.  So, that's proof of my artistic little heart at work.
