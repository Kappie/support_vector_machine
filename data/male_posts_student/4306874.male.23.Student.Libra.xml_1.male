You know, that guy is really really lucky. That is my ultimate goal on life: To have at least ONE kid. I just want one, for starters. I'm not greedy.  I'd make a good dad. I've worked with kids before. I worked in a prep school and at Summer Camps, and I've done my baby-sitting stints. Kids just seem to like me from the start. I'm the kinda guy you see in supermarket lines making funny faces at kids.  There's just something that draws me to it, creating life, then refining it. Pointing out the good and wrong of life, playing God to an extent to something that is, for all intents and purposes, YOU, upgrade v.0.1 (or in this guy's case, v.0.4a and v.0.4b... HA! I kill me...).  It is, and should be, the ultimate goal in life. People waste time wondering "Why are we here", and the answer is in the eyes of the first child they come across.  Either that, or they've never had kids of themselves.
