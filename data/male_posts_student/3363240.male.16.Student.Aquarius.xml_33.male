Math-TEST French- Hoang assigned a huge amount of homework last night, and today didn't even give a shit....so I had to convince her to mark it down for points. History-Returned our books, no one was there, so I had to wait 5-10 minutes into lunch to return the book LUNCH- Rehearsal. We rehearsed The Brig English- Blatz calls monet's group (I'm in it) and we had to do our play, WITHOUT ONE REHEARSAL!  After school: French Homework begins. Dan calls, asks me to hang out with him by the south gym, to wait for spencer. I arrive, and cannot fit through the gate (b/c of my large chest :-P) and have to climb the fence. As I had my skateboard, I was trying little tricks. Just little tricks. and then, I decided to try a big-ish trick. WHAM fall....hit my head on concrete bench and land in a puddle. So now: My back, pants, shirt, boxers, wallet, and ass are all wet. I talk to dan about why he's waiting, he realises that it wasn't a good idea, and we leave. Dan takes the #2 bus, and I skate off. I'm going pretty fast, and all of a sudden  WHAM wheels stop moving, I flip off my board, land on my head, roll on to my shoulder, arm, and wrist. I also rolled my right ankle pretty bad, and hurt my left wrist.  So now I'm home, and have a shitload of homework to do. NONE of which I can start before going to Michaels art supply. I had to go to michaels to buy little styrofoam balls. I arrive at michaels, go to the styrofoam balls section, and find the sizes I need. I needed 14 big ones and 6 little ones. THEY ONLY COME IN PACKS OF 12 so now I had to buy twice as many little ones as I needed, and almost twice as many big balls as I needed. I was running late b/c of the line at michaels.  My ankle is rolled, so it hurts when I'm running to the car. Dad is waiting for me, we go home. I start work immediatley. I had to make 10 corrections to essays from English. I only found 8. because one essay I never got back. So I had to write a long confusing note. THEN I had to do another english assignment. Which I thought was a photoshopped thinger. I almost finished the thinger, when my friend Jenny notified me that "you have to compare it to something else" and I said FUCK IT!  How about all that happening in one day. funny shit.  ~Elan. p.s comments I DARE YOU! please?
