My baby is looking for a new job in San Diego... I don't want him to go! But I won't say anything... is not my call at all. Today we have a month together, I just remembered. Good thing I'm busy with school, so I won't be thinking about him 24/7, is not healthy ;) ... lol!  He's a sweet guy... I need to get new clothes, I've been losing weight and the ones I have are a little too big, specially my shirts. Good thing they are not that expensive here in Mxl...
