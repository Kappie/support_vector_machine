Catching up with my reading as my build gets done and here are my picks:       Interview with Chomsky - it is a  urlLink  must read  . Has references to Animal Farm and to educated people like you and me.    Another interesting article about  urlLink free speech unless it is critical      Makes one wonder if iraqis are the only ones who have opressive regimes
