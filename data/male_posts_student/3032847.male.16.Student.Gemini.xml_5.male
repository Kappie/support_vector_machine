Didn't have a clue about half the paper. Bugger! Then I revised for physics all night, apart from when I did nothing at all, and the other times, when I watched Coronation Street. Twice.  Todays a beast! I did mint in me Physics exam this morning, no- not because I had half the formulas written on my arm :-).. and I only have ONE EXAM LEFT :-D and I cleaned out my safe, only to find I am in the possession of Â£260.
