So, we all get in our little family sedan, my Ethiopian cousin, my psycho mother, my sick step-father, Tatina and me.  So, on the way to Richmond, my step-father vomits twice, my mother is yelling and screaming, I am TRYING to sleep, Shane is bright-eyed looking for something.  Needless to say when we get to Richmond, my father goes to the hospital and we go to Deb's.  Deb of course is making all of the food as we arrive to sit and wait for HOURS!  When mother is at the hospital...  So, my step-father has pancreasitis, fun, fun!  Gosh, I HATE IT HERE!  There is no, instant messaging services on the computer at all, it is a dail-up (lagging, isn't the word I am looking for... slow as a snail?)  I want to be back in Virginia Beach in my own bed, in my own house.  I hate fully like you aren't where you need to be.  i am worried about how Jared's Thanksgiving is, with his two exes there...  And, Micheal, he is in Florida, I want to give up!  I am sooooo annoyed by this place already.  It is like rusty, dirty, sharpened, Indian (Yes Indian have you seen that one dude nails?  They drag!!!) nails on some beatup chalkboard.  I can't wait to be home!
