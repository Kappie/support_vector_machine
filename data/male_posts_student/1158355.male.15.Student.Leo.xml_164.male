We hung out the rest of the day and learned Smells Like Teen Spirit. I have to drum and sing. Gavin sings also but I have to sing the chorus because it's a high voice. We kicked ass at it and we're gonna perform it tomorrow at our mini show. Then we saw this video of this lady falling down this hole thing behind a cash register, the funniest thing I've ever seen. urlLink Click here!  So Dan's mom drove over to bring my Nintendo magazine I had left there and Usual Suspects which we were going to watch but Dan went to this kid Bryan's house, already had plans for it. So I went to play Lasertron with Paul, Jay, Jared, Rebecca, Emily...and other girls. Then my dad picked me up, got home, I showed him the lady falling video and now I'm learning the actual lyrics for Teen Spirit considering at first all I did was scream random words. Cy'all later. Tomorrow's SUPER BOWL SUNDAY AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S IN IT!!!
