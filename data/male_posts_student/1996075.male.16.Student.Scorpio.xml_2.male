Fencing tourney today was fun (1st and 3rd, woohoo!), and tommorrow should be better too. yah! and i might get to see leia. i hope i do. yeah. I am so not looking forward to school monday. I have roughly barely any time to work on my history project and so for the next few hours it will be all fencing eating and historing.
