In fact, I think the government should expand the weekend to include Thursdays.. or better yet, just have everyone do their normal thing, go their normal places, but do absolutly NOTHING there. So basically, a day of laziness in the middle of the week. Damn, that would make my day. Drum major tryouts were today (if you don't know what that is I disband you as a friend of mind. Ok, if you really dont know, its the guy with the big hat who directs the marching band most of the time and is a student. Basically, a student leader.) Unfortunately, I don't think my good friend, Colin, who was auditioning, made it. Another guy name Arun was better in most areas  . I suck at drumming. Well, I don't suck, I'm just not as good as I want to be. So yeah. ....
