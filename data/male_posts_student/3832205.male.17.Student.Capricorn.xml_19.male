Anyway I had a great time and have never been around such a great group of people. You guys are so much fun, although I wish her birthday could have gone better :-/.  Last night wasn't the best of night due to some things I herd, which triggered some stuff in my brain that was long forgotten. Sorry Cody if it hurt you. Kimmie, wtf. Jim, ha, don't even try and start, you don't know what can be done.  By going this weekend I know I brought a lot of joy to peoples hearts, and I am greatful for that. I also brought some sadness, poor Laura ;), she missed me so much she left me 80 messages in like 2 min :-D.  Anyway, I really appreciate everything all of you do, not just who I listed, but everyone. I have some great friends. And Laura, I will miss you this week. :(   Quote:  "Can't you tell that I'm loosing myself"  Music:  New Found Glory - Forget My Name  Mood:  I really don't know
