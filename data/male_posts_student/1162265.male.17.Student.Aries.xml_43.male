I'd think it was history, but the Test is Tuesday... So what did I forget?  Whatever, it's not worth worrying over.  Tommorow only happens once, may as well face it.  Sunday school was pretty funny, because Mr. Harewood, accidently implied how evil Gnosisticsm was.  That was pretty funny, because it made me cringe.  Then Mrs. Smith was telling all the little kids the purpose of Lent, and was talking about how Jesus was tempted by the devil.  That really made me think..... Why would the devil offer Jesus the earth if God, and by extension Jesus created it.  It made me think of the Gnosistic idea that the creator of Earth is actually evil, and God is completely different.  So if the creator of the Earth, I don't know how metaphorically to take it, was offering Jesus his world, it would make far more sense.... who knows.  Gnosistic writtings will drive a poor Christian crazy.  I shoul've just gone to an Abyssinian church when I had the chance.  Wow, only the most hardcore Christians can probubly understand what I'm actually saying.  Man, I really need to stop being so serious though.  I'm alienating myself more then I should.
