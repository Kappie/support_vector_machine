This is a day for grieving for our nation. I think of what it was intended to be, what it should be ... and then I realize what it actually is. Most people's interpretation of the Declaration of Independence focuses on "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness." The last four words are the ones most often remembered: the pursuit of happiness. Agh! Pursuing happiness means you will NOT find it! (See the post entitled, "The media, happiness, and Christianity.") People assume that happiness = money. Therefore, the American Dream became perverted into an endless chasing of cash. Self-serving materialism. But that isn't life, and that sure as hell isn't liberty. The concept of life is simple, but not as simple as people seem to think. Living and existing are very different things. Most Americans just exist. We're a young nation and therefore don't have a lot of history. You'd think, then, that we'd focus on the present, but we don't. We focus on the only thing not worth focusing on: the future. Worry about the present, the future falls into place. Worry about the future and the present gets away from you. This is why so many Americans waste their sorry lives working Nine-to-Fives that they'd really rather not do at all. They're busy packing money away like squirrels with nuts, not realizing that there won't be a winter. Liberty and freedom are terms we've really screwed up. Freedom isn't just the ability to choose. Everybody has that ability, it's what makes us human. No, freedom doesn't equal choice. Freedom is making the RIGHT choice. Freedom is knowing what is right and doing it. Freedom and Truth are very intertwined, in my mind.  Truth isn't just a singular concept, either. It's a relationship between the way things are and the way they ought to be. Truth has to exist in order for something to be false, right? But Truth must also exist in order for something to be true. If one thing is called true, and another false, then those things are being compared to a higher standard: Truth. I think that higher standard is absolute Truth, or the way things were intended to be; the origin of all good things. In other words, God. Freedom, for me, is seeking Truth. It isn't buying cool toys and making myself comfortable. It isn't doing whatever I want. As Five Iron Frenzy sings, "Sorry for my lack of faith, I'm not the greatest patriot/ If this is all there is to freedom I don't want it." So shoot off those fireworks and celebrate simply because we're supposed to be. I'll probably enjoy the flames just because they're burning. But at the same time, I'll be grieving because nobody knows what freedom is, anymore. On a less serious note, I'm reflecting on some of the taxes leading up to the American Revolution. Remember how Americans got pissed over some ridiculous tax on tea? Well, gas prices, although lower, are still just under two bucks. Let's frickin rebel! Want to really celebrate Independence Day? Let's go dress like Cow Creek Indians and dump gasoline into Coos Bay!
