The depressing darkness, The falling rain, The cold winds… Like in movies where a great character dies… It is depressing to watch and accept. Yet, to some, not all rains are bad, To some, it’s calming and beautiful... Life blooming due to rain, Beauty will rise after this pain. So don’t let it make you insane. After all, it is only the rain, And it can’t rain all the time
