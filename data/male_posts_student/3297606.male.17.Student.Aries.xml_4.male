His golden body glistens and is the very centerof attention at my little "station." He holds his reeth with valiance and pride. Although he is naked, it seems he is missing some, er... certain organs. which i think is good, in my case, it must suck for him. this object of naked glory is infact my oscar. yep, good.  You know what would suck? if hats all of the sudden turned into head-eating ferrets. then the instant the hats transformed, everybody who was wearing a hat would die. man, that would SUCK. i bet they would be black instead of the generic brown, because black is way more deadly.  heck foo im eating. i have to cut the usual endings off before my parents poison my food. PEACE  current pace - HASTE
