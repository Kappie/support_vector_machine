"cassini is the most sophisticated interplanetary space probe ever. it will embark on a four year mission to survery saturn's moons, even passing by phoebe and titan." i want to work for NASA. space travel is hott!  so, summer certainly has kicked off with a bang. actually no, but it doesnt really matter. i cant wait for nikos and sean to get back from korea. then hopefully things will pick up... they cant help to. theres nowhere to go but up. if going to the JC means these first two weeks of summer stretched out over two years, i really dont think that i want any part of that. i think id rather die than have such a huge expanse of dead time. maybe doing school for one year really does outweigh being comatosely bored for two. hmmm.  i dont even know. there are like 6 more weeks or something of summer. leaving santa rosa needs to be in order. perhaps, if the necessary permission slips are returned, some sort of a road trip to like... washington... could be done. if not, maybe i should just blow my savings account on a trip to like tokyo. now THAT would be awesome.   speaking of which, i need to move to japan.  but yeah. this summer painfully illustrates the extent to which i have no actual connections to anybody in my life. friends are friends, and nothing really more. the notion of best friends is kind of dead now, nor does it really even matter. nothing ever gets done and feelings are never expressed. its sad, but for that at least, there is nobody to blame but myself. over the years ive never done enough to establish stong bonds with people, friends or otherwise. things simply drag on and i accept them, even when they make me miserable or cross. life is a series of drifting into peoples' orbits, and then drifting back out, never really taking or feeling any different than you did going in. which isnt to say that things remain unchanged. simply, its not an external movement, all of this. its a matter of changing inside, but the failing to relate that to how i deal with other people. people never really know whats going on, which is probably a good thing, but doing that makes life a hollow repetition of feeling dead and being alone. i dont know. i need to leave this shit. everything about this town, this state, the people i know- all of it makes me hate myself and everybody else for making me feel that way. its not their fault, its mine, and i just cant wait for this goddamn year to be over and be able to leave this all behind me. this really shouldnt be written online, but i dont mind. we fight our own wars, thank you very much.  muzik: converge "a farewell note to this city"
