At 5AM I ventured downstairs and played some CoH for a few hours - level 16 is playing through much smoother than level 15. By the time I went back upstairs to sleep it was actually cold, so I needed my comforter. It's a bizarre country in which we live. The American's don't have to put up with this nonsense, they issued an ultimatum to Mother Nature and just pointed at Saddam. 85, breezy and partly cloudy every day. Not a bad deal, if you've got the nukes to back it up.  I have to go to work (that's sort of a given, it's a day that ends in "...day") and I'm still tired and cranky. I was going to ride my bike, but it's really cold now. I get the feeling it's going to be horrid. Ah well.  I had a nightmare last night where I lost a tooth. Even with my braces in. It was fucked up. I have a real thing against limb loss (if you've read the blog, you know) which definately includes teeth. Not pleased, not pleased at all. I'm going to have to have a sit down with the old subconscious and let it know that this sort of behavious simply will not be tolerated.
