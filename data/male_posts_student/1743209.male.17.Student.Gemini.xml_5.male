So I have just emailled the hosting company asking what I have to do to pay them for another year's hosting. I almost shat myself cos i thought it was overdue!  Anyway, moving on. Today has been pretty non-eventful. I have been playing some guitar, trying to get back into the habit of playing daily, which i normally do during term time, as i find it relaxing when I get home from school. Lately, I have been going through a bit of an acoustic phase with my electric guitar playing, whereas I normally play rock type music. Today I have stumbled upon the beginnings of what could be a pretty decent acoustic song, so i am going to work on that.  Also, I have started sorting out my room, there's loads of crap that I just don't want/need anymore in here, and I can tell you that alot of it that isn't rubbish is going on ebay!  Anyway, post again tommorrow!
