(i liked the landscape pictures in the american art room the best.) then to tower city for food and shopping. we also went to parma town mall on the way home. i had a nice time. the other major happening in modern times is the upcoming closing of school and departure of the senior class. i'll miss a lot of people. katie and kelly at lunch. brittanie dial in the mornings. teri when she sees me parking next to her mysteriously much like a stalker would. obviously and most of all amber. not that i won't see her. it's just nice to have chance run-ins with the one you adore. i have a solution to all these goodbye blues... fail the whole entire senior class so they are bound here forever. i think i like it.  last night was the rib burn off. the food was absolutely beastin'. there were some good laughs. we went to cyber pete's but i think everyone was too tired for a wild time. it was an alright night though.   after what seems to have been the longest, but funnest school year to date has now been dimished to only finals week now, summer is almost in full stride. there are a couple of things i hope to accomplish before junior year will undoubtably sneak up upon me. the following list comes with the condition/idea to stay out of trouble during these actions. in no specific order:  -get a job, if possible an enjoyable one.  -achieve some sort of physical fitness so i can go to the beach with some dignity. -have great fun on vacation with amber and my mom to virginia beach. i'm sure that won't be difficult.  -hang out more with all my friends. especially mitch and tom cause we haven't just hung out in forever. i miss hanging out with both of them, hilairous kids. -spend time with my favorite girl, of course. why not be with the person who makes you happiest? all the laughs and little things make everything so good.   so those are my plans for a great summer. what are yours? (post your own or i have comments.) well i'm off to get this shaggy mess trimmed down. take care and watch your step... unlike grandma hryb. hahaha.
