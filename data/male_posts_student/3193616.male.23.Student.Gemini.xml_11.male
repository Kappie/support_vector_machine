The one thing i would like to coment particularly here is the apparent thought in the congress or any other camp about correcting the blunders of the previous govt in the national interest. I dont understand hou can anyone assume what they do is in the national interest and what ever others have done has been antinational. this meatlity of politicians really baffles me. Iam at loss to understand this phenomenon across the ploitical divide. Lets see what this govt will do towards the  urlLink Golden Quadrilateral . it would be a silly and costly mistake on the part of congress to ignore the project.
