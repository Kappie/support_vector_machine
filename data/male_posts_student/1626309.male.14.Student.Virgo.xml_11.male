The gym is practically finished, as the work crew are laying down the school emblem and will paint it today. We have seen the new library, science room, the commons, and a typical classroom. The computer lab isn't finished yet. I'd say the school looks good except for the unfinished rooms, which have some wires hanging from the ceiling, but I'm sure that will be fixed by the next two weeks. Oh yes, as an extra surprise... Phoenix will torn down on the last day!! Yay! Now... If I only had some C4 and a detonator.  For information on the new school buliding  urlLink click here
