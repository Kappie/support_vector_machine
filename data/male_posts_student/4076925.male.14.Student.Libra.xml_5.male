What a gay ass excuse for a movie.  Anyway, I am kinda disapointed in one of my friends.  I am now doubting if  [blank]  tells the truth to me.  I think I caught  [blank]  in a lie, but I am not sure.  I might confront  [blank]  later about it and get the real story.  It is disapointing.  Also I finished Draft Three of my screenplay currently titled The Abduction of Four.  I guess it is a good script, I have had it screened with some people, they all liked it except one.  He hates it.
