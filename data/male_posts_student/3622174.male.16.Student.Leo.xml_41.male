So, here's how you do it:  1. You can either add a Google bar (I haven't figured that one out yet), or, you can use a cool one that I found called FreeFind.    2. Go to www.freefind.com and sign up for an account.  You'll have to put in your blog's URL at some point, and the name of your blog.  3. Tell the Freefind spider to search your site while you put the HTML on your sidebar.  The spider will track through your site to create a search list.    4. You want to request the spider to go through your site on a regular basis if you want it to keep up with every new post that you add.  So, you should go to Schedule Re-indexing, and tell it that you want it to spider every day or whenever you want it.  You will receive an email everytime your site is spidered, so spider accordingly.  5. You need to put the HTML onto your sidebar, or where ever you want to put it on your blog.  So, click on HTML, click "Site Search Only."  This will put a search bar on your blog that ONLY searches your site, not the entire interweb.    6. After your HTML is on your blog, publish it, and take a look at it.  If the spider has not searched your blog yet, it won't work until it does.  It will show up, but it won't work.    And that's todays tip.  If you have any questions about today's tip or any other post, you can leave a comment, and I'll be sure to answer your questions.   ------------------------ Daily Wrap Up- July 5, 2004  Well, I changed a lot of stuff that I wasn't planning on changing, but minor computer problems are setting things back a little bit.  Tomorrow, I will have an all tip for Blogger, as well as my first Photoshop trick.  But, before I go off rambling about tomorrow, here's a summary of today here on bagel.tech:  In sites we looked at 2 sites today, re-reviewing 1up.com and GameHouse.com.  1up.com was reviewed last week, but technical difficulties on the site lead me to give it a C.  I re-reviewed it today, now that the problems are fixed, and it received an A and a gold award.  GameHouse is the creator of popular web games such as Collapse and Text Twist, and it received an A, as well.  For today's download, we looked at XFire Messenger.  This is the first instant messenger built for gamers, and it has some unique features and an awesome design.  XFire isn't for everyone, and it received an A.  Today's game of the day was Cubis.  This game is highly addicting, and one of my favorite games that I have reviewed so far.  The controls can be a little sloppy at times, despite me saying they were good.  It has a nice interface, but, this game loads really slow.  It received an A as well.  And finally, today's tip was how you can add a search bar to your blog, and have it search through your blog.  This is very easy to do, and it is great for sites like this one, and other blogs, and is a much easier way to find things than going through the archives.    That's it for today's bagel.tech updates.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for Late Night Bloggin', and be sure to check the archives there tonight, because I'm going to be moving the posts from my old blog on Xanga to Blog of Bagel, and the archives will all be under the proper dates.  Tomorrow, check back because we're going to be having 2 tips, one for Photoshop, and one for Blogger, a new download of the day, and a new game (no site of the day tomorrow).  Here's what to expect:  Starting things off tomorrow is my first Photoshop tip at 9:00 a.m. Then, at 11:00, check out the download of the day, which is undecided at this point. At 2:00, the game of the day is something on Uproar, but, I haven't made up my mind as to what it is yet. And, the Blogger tip for tomorrow is how to add Haloscan to your blog.    So, be sure to check it out tomorrow, it's going to be a power packed day here on bagel.tech.  See ya later.
