It  is about creating a Web of machine-readable homepages describing people, the links between them and the things they create and do.   "Okay, sounds pretty neat," I thought to myself.  I headed on over to the  urlLink FOAF-a-matic , and proceeded to make  urlLink my FOAF file .   I believe I will write my own generator soon, as I had some troubles using the FOAF-a-matic with my favourite browser,  urlLink Opera .   Update:  I have coded up a  very  basic  urlLink FOAF file generator .  Of course I'll expand upon it, when I figure out how to become unlazy.  It almost seems to be - as  urlLink this post describes it  - a "tired standard."  Sure, the idea is very interesting, but no one is really using it yet.  I usually have  quite  a bit of time on my hands, so I may have to play with it a bit.  We'll see how that goes.
