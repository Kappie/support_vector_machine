It may be significant that the time immediately before and during Sibelius’s work on the Violin Concerto was marked by one of his worst periods of alcoholism. His heroically patient wife Aino frequently went out to search Helsinki’s fashionable clubs, bars and restaurants for him, hoping against hope that he might just sober up enough to complete the work.  The slow movement of the Concerto was apparently sketched out during a colossal three-day hangover.  Sibelius’s brother, Christian (a clinical psychiatrist), begged him to stop drinking. But Sibelius replied that he was just too weak. ‘When I am standing in front of a grand orchestra and have drunk a half-bottle of champagne, then I conduct like a young god. Otherwise I am nervous and tremble, feel unsure of myself, and then everything is lost. The same is true of my visits to the bank manager.’  - http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/aboutmusic/sibelius_violinconcerto.shtml  NO WHY DID THE AUDIENCE CLAP AFTER THE FIRST MOVEMENT?! in case you didn't know - and you probably didn't, i know my audience XD - most classical music is made up of sections called  movements  and between them you're not supposed to clap even if the orchestra stops. one of the reasons is to allow other audience members to listen to the piece as a holistic experience - without interruption.  generally the only thing that happens within a break between movements is coughing. loud hacking coughs heard from all members of the orchestra and the audience.  well anyway the bbc radio quality today is disgusting. probably my connection's fault. doesn't help that i'm blogging and reading all i can about sibelius' violin concerto. cos it's really a brilliant piece. but i think i'll use my borders voucher to get a recording of this, of some bass concerti, of bach's b minor mass (dunno why really) and one or two books.  post comments please. i can't decide which books to get. or which cds for that matter.
