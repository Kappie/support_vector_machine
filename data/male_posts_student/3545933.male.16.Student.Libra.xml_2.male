So, anyway. an explanation is due on what the hell the title of this entry means. Well, after careful pondering i haven't actually released any information of importance about myself. This presents me with a moral dilemma. Do i delve further into my life and tell the public more about me, or should i be a reclusive wombat, whisping through the air and through the shadows, Appearing and making nonsical statements about plankton and dissapearing just as quick.  I actually don't know what to do, so i'll go with the tried and tested method of doing both. divulge a little information and drop back into the shadows. So... to get you going, i'm a typical english guy, year eleven, in a relationship (for how long i don't know) who loves music and movies.  but anyway, stuff. buttons and things.  tata.
