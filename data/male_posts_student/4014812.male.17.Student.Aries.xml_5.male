But tomorrow... tomorrow me and James and possibly Wes are gonna go swimming at the pool across the street from me and we can go ZOOOM down the waterslides and other misc fun THINGS... LOL. I havent been swimming for like a year, even though i should go more often because im a really good swimmer. Just no one to go with since Christian left to goto Princeton... STUPID CHRISTIAN...    **EDIT**    LoL... Steph sent me these randoms pictures... Just thoght id share with everyone lol       (drew hearts on their tounges for some reason?)
