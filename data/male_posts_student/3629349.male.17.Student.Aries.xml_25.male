What i want is very simple, i hust wanna do whatever i like(w/o the expense of other's happiness), and stay happy.       Friends, family, my fishes, bball are my today priorities now.Love life now, i will not do anything at the moment.and i kinda hate some gers.They just take the guys for granted.We are not born to be ordered around by you, nor born just to entertain you and doing silly stuff which we look like stupid silly morons.Well, i have had enough.All these nonsense shall ceased.Unless it's my close friends and my loved ones, i won't do any other nonsensical thing.This sounds so mean and sensitive, but i just need to set a standard for myself.      I'm getting far too ill disciplined this days, i need to really get myself more organised.....i shall see, as actions speak louder than words.bball....is still my love....nor i will give up things that i like....mY fiShiEs!~and friends...never give up hopes in them.... if tanghoe you are reading this......i didn't give up our friendship nor 4SE.....bRoTH3rS foRevEr~!
