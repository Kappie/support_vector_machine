"When a REAL love isn't returned, part of a man dies inside and will be gone forever." I wanted to mention a few things I like about movies...  I especially like how necklaces are snapped off of a personâ€™s neck with the greatest of ease, often to be reattached later as if the  chain magically is not broken in half.  I enjoy fight scenes in which people get hit in the face with metal objects but continue fighting like they just got slapped by a small girl.  I love when hilarity ensues because the main character doesnt have enough balls to say "I broke it, sorry I'll buy you a new one"  When every person in the movie seems to be really good at  Kung-Fu...love that.  I love watching such realistic scenes like the motorcycle driving at high speed on top of a train going at top speed in Torque. Actually the whole trailer for Torque has ridiculously improbable scenarios with people speeding on a motorcycle and flipping around fighting...its retarded.  I actually just got done watching Underworld. It was entertaining. Its the battle between vampires and werewolfs thats been raging for thousands of years. It just reminded me of a Matrix meets  Tomb Raider type of thing. Is it too much to ask that some things be realistic. I know were suspending reality in watching a movie  like this, but if the characters fight with regular guns, then dammit I want automatic weapons shot from 15 feet away of a group of  people to hit someone. At least in the Matrix the characters were known to be able to play with gravity and such. I understand fight scenes look cool, but I'm sure it could look cool, but be somewhat plausible at the same time...thats all I ask...Thanks.
