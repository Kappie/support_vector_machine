The plan was for me to take my brothers (Dan, Paul, and Jimmy) to the Akron Air Show today, but before we could leave I had to help direct traffic at church.  One of the things I really like about helping direct traffic is that I get to be one of the first persons people see when they arrive.  Of course, the flip side of this is that I get to see people as they arrive, and something hit me today - for joy supposedly being one of the principal byproducts of the Christian faith, a lot of people didn't look too happy to get to church.  And then I wondered what I looked like (sometimes the hardest thing to see is your own expression) - I try to always be smiling and friendly, but is that actually the way it comes across?  And Lord knows I don't exactly have one of those bubbly personalities, so I have no idea what I look like to other people - sometimes when I feel like I'm smiling it comes across looking like a smirk or something else :(  Anyway, I got done parking and headed down to the show.  When we got there an F-117 (i.e. the Stealth fighter) was doing some flybys, so that was really cool.  Most of the rest of the show was older prop planes, which I'm not really into.  But it was kind of cool to see some of them - they even had a B-17 that flew around a couple of times.  And I'm having thoughts about the military again, only this time I'm thinking about the Army or Air Force Reserves - I don't know exactly why, but I just feel this longing to really back up what I say about America with some action, and this is the best way I can think of.  When we got back from the air show we were supposed to eat, but my sisters weren't back with the grill we were buying for my dad for Father's Day yet (although they swore that the hold-up was due to some incredible story they wouldn't tell us over the phone!).  So when they get back we unload the grill and show it to my dad and all, then my sisters told us how they got the grill for only $88 when it was actually supposed to be $188! (basically, they spoke with a couple of people, pointed out that the grill was under a $88 sign and not marked otherwise, and the management actually bought it)  The rest of the evening was basically sitting around and talking, a lot of it centering around my cousin (although I'm not going to get into that here and now) or our schedule for the next week.  Then I headed back home and picked up some things, then headed over to my aunt's house to house-sit tonight (I'm doing so all week).  And that was basically my day...I know this blog was boring, I promise to do better tomorrow!
