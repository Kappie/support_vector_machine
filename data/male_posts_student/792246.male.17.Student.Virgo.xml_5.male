I recommend all of you try it, and live to tell the results.  I'm going to be all alone senior year. Blarg! I'm depressed now. Why why why? Oh well. I'll just have to send letter bombs to everyone. Twice.  I left my movie at Lizzy's house. And my bike, but that was intentional, making the DVD a far more tremendous problem. Lizzy?  What's with me doing carriage returns every  freaking  sec  ond?  Oh well, I like it. Am I sexy? I think I'm sexy. People, this is a critical survey. If you don't respond I'll sing Yatta non-stop for the rest of my life. And for those of you that wouldn't mind that, I'll never sing Yatta again. Don't ask how I do both, just receive the threat. Come people, tell me of my sexiness. For reference, come over right now and see me naked.     The movie in question was some little-known movie called "The Fellowship of the Ring". Yeah, I hadn't heard of it either. Oh, the irony of me whining about my senior year. Somehow, it almost seemed shorter than the others. Oh right.
