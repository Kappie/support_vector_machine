Close the annoying pop-up box, push the back button or race to the stop button and you'll get to keep playing, hoping that the javascript or whatever other programming they've used doesn't restrict you from playing it twice.  Most of the time these addictive games are better than anything the website with the add has or the website that is advertising has. They are often a lot better than that freeware game you spent 10 hours downloading last night, but you don't want to admit it. Refresh the page and you'll lose the ad and be going back to playing the freeware game, hoping that the computer doesn't perform the 400th illegal error in weeks.  But there are those that stay.  urlLink Prime TV  is an example of one which, if you press the stop button just before it redirects, can allow you to keep bouncing balls. Just press the balls, and they'll rise. Then try to get them all up. And if that gets you, you're probably a kiwi who watches Aussie programs in prime time.  OK, maybe waiting to download freeware isn't that bad.
