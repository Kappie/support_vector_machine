You win some and you lose some. Well, I lost this 1. *Sighz* this is my most disappointing result I've got so far, apart frm English.  Next was E maths, which I was told tt I failed my paper 2. So I wasn't realli expecting much. But when I got it back, I got a 57/100. As for paper 1, I failed by 1 mark, 39/80. So the overall was like 53, which was a C6. I felt pretty lucky to even pass cus I wasn't prepared and my mind wasn't focusing on the 2 papers on tt day, it was somewhere else.  There wasn't PE today, so more slacking juz took place in class during tt period. No work was done or wadsoeva. Haha, this juz proves how slack I am.  Geography was oso slack, cus there was nothing left to do. I was playing wif tt lil'pig who said I was GAY! OMG! Grrr! Hate tt lil' pig! So mean, nasty, hostile, horrible and terrible!  Den 1 period of Chinese was swap for Social Studies, so tt we could get back our results. I passed, but not veri well, got a 32/50. This enabled be to pass my combined humanities juz slightly at a 54%. So, like I said, you win some and you lose some. Words of Shawn The Great once again. Haha.  We had a period of Chinese after Social Studies and an English period. 2 more slack periods as nothing was done. The fat pussy cat was juz sittin in front of me and as usual, doing silly stuffs to me AGAIN! For example, amusing himself wif MY stapler! He not onli wasted a whole row of staples, he even tried stapling my arms and hair. Well, sometimes ppl can realli get dumb and do silly stuffs, especially fat pussy cats! In the end, he destoyed my whole stapler, wad an idiot! Not onli tt, as u all noe he would never stop till he gets turned on. So wad did he do? OMG! He used his right arm to hold me down and used his left hand to grab the most important part of a male. Isn't tt gay? If tt wasn't enough, he continued squeezing it till his satisfactory. OMG! Sometimes, it's extremely hard to noe wad's going on in his head. After he was done, he even gave me tt seductive face once again and the look of satisfaction. Next, he made the Australian Idol, Guy Sebastian, sound like a well, HOE? L0L! He was tryin to sing the song entitled "Angels Brought Me Here". Firstly, it isn't the angels tt brought him here, it's more like the devils! Secondly, he sounded like a cow! Thirdly, He sang wif such a seductive and disgusting look on his face, tt made my hair stood up and sent chill down my spine. As usual, he was giving me his seducive face wif his kuku eyes and smile. As u all noe, I'm a polite person, so I juz had to endure tt suffering and smile back at him, which seemed to haf pleased him a hell lot! L0L! There's also this paper crane, which was given to me by some1's special, in my pencil case. He did the most disgusting thing when he put the poor lil' crane in his mouth! EWWW!!! DISGUSTING is the word! And now not onli the crane stinks, my whole pencil case stinks! Thank god he didn't chew it or did something even more disgusting! Disgusting Gay Fat Pussy Cat!!!  After school, I went wif frens to haf lunch at the hawker centre. After tt we made our way to the West Coast Recreational Centre to play pool. Out of the 4 of us, onli the fat pussy cat was not 16. So when we got there, I wasn't surprised tt the person in charge asked to see all our IC or EZ-link Card? Why? Cus the person probably think tt the fat pussy cat is still in Pri Sch as his height is comparable to tt of a Pri Sch student. In the end, we decided not to play as he would onli be able to watch, which was so unfair. We decided to go to Clementi and watch Troy once again. But we didn't as the next show time was 5:30pm, which is like now? L0L! So all of us made our way home.  Instead of stopping at Bukit Batok Interchange, I went to the Bukit Gombak Interchange to pick up some stuffs on the way back home. I went to see the price of some pairs of shoe. The price range was around $30 - $40, which is considered cheap to me. I intend to get 1 of those soon too. Hehe, den I went to buy some mobile phone's pouch for my frens. I made my way home after tt.  ***Important Update On My Injury*** I'm able to control the pain much betta now. There were ppl who punched and knocked into my rib today, but it wasn't tt bad. So I think it's nearly back to normal rite now. But I think if anybody was to squeeze my ribs, den I'll be a goner. But, I noe tt will never happen as I'll haf a speedy recovery! Haha, alrite den. Cya all! =]
