It's pronounced NWAR for those who don't know), and as of right now, it seems as if she has a slight crush on Hobbes of all people =O! So, there ya go. Oh! And the Homestar Runner CD is out. It's called:    STRONG BAD SINGS! and other type hits    And, as an added bonus, my birthday's comin' up! YYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYY!!!! Laterz.
