I wanted to go outside and she was calling me back about that so she waited until I finished my TV show and my ice-cream and shepherd pie and then we're going outside now. I miss Nima and I wish he could come but he's out so whatever.  Well, I'm gonna go get ready... bringing my cowboy hat. Hehe~ I'm off. Peace out. Gonna be back in an hour. By then, I'd probably be kicked off the computer 'cos my sis will be home from her party and she'll be on the computer so meh. Bye bye.  P.S. Read Ingrid's blog. Damn, she's got a lot going on... gonna pray for her too.
