I happen to be actually quite content at the moment (mostly because I've been reading Laura's old archives from when I was all sweet and fresh ^_^).  I've been thinking today about Emma Hole, the U6 girl who died late last year. For those of you who don't know, she was driving when she lost control of the car and it crashed into another car. She was killed outright. It's just the U6 left today and I was reading through Pete Hards' yearbook and, flicking through, I'd gone past the people I know and love well; Alan Bills, Sally Grant, Pete Hards, Sam Taunton, Vicki Selby... some people I know less well, too; Ben George, Delyth Elliot, Carolyn Sheppard... and I got to the entry on Emma Hole. It was fairly short, concentrating on how kind and beautiful she was, and how she would always be remembered. I then got to thinking about Sam Taunton, who was knocked off his bike about half way through last year, and was in a coma as a result of serious head injuries. I thought about how he survived without serious reprecussions, and returned to school with us in September. It seems horrible to say it but I'm almost glad it was her instead of him. They say we pay for every survival with a death; and I didn't know Emma apart from by face. But even in that... I'm not going to forget her. Even though I have no idea what she was like.   They say time is the fire in which we burn.  -  Dr. Soran, Star Trek: Generations   Love, Jon Roskilly
