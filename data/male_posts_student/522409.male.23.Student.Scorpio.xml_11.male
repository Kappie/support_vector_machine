Gaaaaaah  So Groove competed in the Boston regional of the Harmony Sweepstakes on March 9th.  Groove has only been together (or had) for about 6 or so weeks by the time competition rolled around, so we certainly were the dark horse in this competition.  We won.  We're going to San Fransisco for the national finals May 4th.  Word.  I can't really get into explaining the competition here or talking about the show much.  I'm sure I'll be in better shape to do so at a later date.  Right now, my stomach's killing me, so less is more, I'm afraid.  If you want more info on what the Sweeps is all about, click the link to the left.  Groove's pic is finally up on the Boston page, so drop in and check it out.  Speaking of Groove... our new website should be up and running soon.  Click the link to the left, or point your browser to www.grooveshouse.com and check out our web-crib.  Life's good.  I went home for the last 2 days to see family and ended up watching 4 movies with my sis.  What were they.  Um... (sorry... momentary annesia) Zoolander (awful), Princess Diaries (coulda been cute if they'd cut a half hour off), Save the Last Dance (I'm evidently the only person who hadn't seen that one), and Bridget Jones' Diary.  Yes, there's a heavy chick-flick influence there.  Deal.    My sister is amazing.  'Nuff said for now.  That girl is incredible.  And single.  And beautiful.  Guys?    The OTR boys are competing in semifinals tonight.  At this time, they've already completed their set.  I'm really excited for them.  They've come so far.  I want them to do well.  I'm nervous.  They drew the #1 spot in concert order tonight.  Ew.  No one wants that.  Especially a group who has a legitimate chance at winning.  Well, it remains to be seen what the judges think.  *crosses fingers*  My stomach hurts.  Screw you, stomach.  Who asked you, anyway?  We auditioned about 27 guys for the Hyannis Sound today.  What a looooooong day.  There were a bunch of really solid candidates.  Really solid.  This is going to prove to be a really hard deliberation process.  And the total for auditionees this year has hit 90.  And it's loking more and more like there are only going to be 4 spots open.  Those aren't good odds.  But two guys are already pretty much selected.  (ssshhhhhh...)  And tomorrow we see another 20-something.  And next weekend in San Fransisco, I see another 13 or so.  And after that, everyone's just gonna kinda blend together.  I was kinda bummed that at the end of today, we decided to pare the day's auditions down to a shortlist of 5.  NYC sent us 4 out of their 13.  So we've got 9-10 guys to consider with another 35 live auditions and a bunch of videos left to evaluate.  Waaaaahhhhh... anyone wanna be us?  C'mon.  You know you wanna.  I was supposed to go see this really fantastic band tonight at the Chopping Block near Mission Hill... but I didn't have the energy to.  I know, I know... waaahhh... whatever.  The band is great, though.  They recorded at Renaissance Wednesday.  Ben Folds with a slice of Soundgarden.  Kickin' songs.  They're great.  Mechanical Shark Head.  Check 'em out if you can.  Last week I saw Time Machine with Groove the night before competition.  The only advice I can give to people considering seeing it is not to.  Your money would be better spent on pretty much anything.  The movie was quite possibly the worst I've ever seen.  All of us nearly walked out.  Bahhhh...  I think that's going to have to be it for now.  Katrina's calling me.  Ohhhhhh my goodness.  So yeah.  Couple long phone calls.  I never do that, but tonight I was in a talking mood.  So talk I did.    OTR is going to Finals.    WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?  They got second at the semis at Stanford tonight.  BYU Vocal Point got first.  Finals are at Lincoln Center on Sunday April 28.  Sunday.  BYU is a Mormon school  They're not allowed to take part in events of any sort on Sunday.  Hence, the school-affiliated Vocal Point boys cannot take part in the finals.  So On the Rocks goes in their stead.  My boys are going to the Finals.  I... have no idea what to do with myself.  Very excited.  I'm listening to Jeff Buckley.  Amazing.  "Everybody Here Wants You."  Beautiful.  When I think of the unwritten music that died with him, I can't help just being so saddened.    Dyl just came home and we talked about the auditions from today.  I think some of the "finalized" decisions today should be reconsidered.  We were tired.  Errors may have been made.  There's one kid in the final considerations from today who I will not be able to live with, and one who was eliminated who had perhaps the best ear of the day.  And a pretty kickin' voice and personality, too.  Whatever.  I'm tired.  I need to go.  Thank you for calling, Melody, dear.  I've missed you.  I'll talk to you soon.  For now I've got to get sleep so I can catch that blasted bus over to BC to sit in on day 2 of auditions.  Second day, same as the first... little bit longer, little bit worse.  Nah.  It'll be... fun-ish.  Enough.  Kristin, I hope you're feeling much, much happier.  I don't like it when you're not.  Margot, I hope you're feeling much better, as well.  I'm so sorry about today's... incident.    I'll talk to you all tomorrow.  Happy St. Patty's Day!
