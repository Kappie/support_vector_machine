I wanted to go there to ask why isn't History offered as a subject combination along with SS. I can't wait to see what pathetique excuses they can come up with. So, I woke up at 6.30, in order to reach there by 7.45.  Okay, we reached there at around 7.35. So early. We sat around (I was being insulted by my brother's friends. Meow!!) and then, at 7.45, the parents went up. Okay. You know what? My stuipid brother told us to come at 7.45, but parents are to be seated at 8.15. What a waste of time. I am gonna kill him. We sat a friend of my mom, who is also the mother of my brother's friends. They made small talk while I listened. And hor, I see no mikes being set up near the audience? Does that mean we cannot ask question? How could they!  At 8.15, the kids came in. Then, they played useless promotional videos for us to see. Stupid, really. Play for us for what? The prinicpal, Mrs Mary Koh, came to talk to us at 8.35.  She's a terrible speaker. She speaks so slow and she seems so unsure of what's she speaking. Oh god! I could have died of boredom from listening to her! Firstly, while introducing the Humanities subjects, she said the school does not offer History. Okay..... Then, next, when introducing the class list, she said again, "We do not have SS/History". DUHZ! We already established that fact long ago! A big mistake she made when introducing SS "It's about the history of Singapore" NONSENSE!!! Ayioh! She doesn't even know what she's saying! Oh god! I critisized her every speech. I think the people in front got sick of my complaints. HaHaHa!  Then, it's time for an external speaker to come talk about improving communications with parents and children. He got some points about parents only see the bad sides of their kids and focussing on them isntead of the good sides. Quite true! Then, i fell asleep for the rest of the speech. Ergh! After the speech, everybody was releashed. The dunnoe-who Mr Tan kept encouraging people to go to the PCCG corner to look at JCs and Polys and ITE courses. So annoying. Repeat that to every class!   Well, we went to the PCCG corner. So little people! And I was being recorded down you know...for reading the stupid leaflet the school gave my brother. So embarrassing! After that, me and mom went to the canteen to eat some refrehsments. We ate the what ar...chicken drumsticks, satay, pineapple tart and drank some drinks la. Hmmm! Not bad, the chicken wings. Taste nice too!  We returned home at 10.15. I watched some cartoons and came online lor. As you know, I went offline at 12 something to eat lunch. Then, I went to Wendy's house.  HaHa! I managed to complete two SS chatpers. The Singapore industrial restructuring one....sucks! Don't understand at all! Sigh!! I introed Wendy to the divination game we played. HaHa! She refused to tell me who it is, but she told Lassie. So, what I did was to tell Lassie "I give you a list of names. If it's the person, you bark, okay?". I gave a few names, and Lassie didn't bark. But!! HAHAHA! I tried another peron's name (whom I suspected of course). I shouted the name while jumping around the living room. Lassie barked (she don't like loud noises and people moving fast!). HAHAHA!! Good dog, Lassie! Qi shi Wendy! HaHa!! Then, we discussed about more issues. HaHa! I fell alsleep at the living room watching Wendy and her mom play a PS game. So embarassing! When I woke up, her mother said "Good morning!". HaHa!!   I left at 5.50 and went home. Reaching home at 6, I bathed and watched shows. Speaking of bathing, yesterday and today, I suffered soap attacks on my eye! Yesterday, a spurt of soap hit my right eye. Woah! So painful! Then today morning, another spray of soap hit my left eye! Now, I don't believe in coincidences. I believe I am being sent a message. To clear my vision? To clean my vision? Of what? I must dwell on this further!   I think I shall end here le. See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
