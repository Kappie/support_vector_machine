On Sunday I went to Mass with Archbishop Flynn. I wanna go crash so here is the abridged version: Steve Agrisano and Father Stan killed disbelief, SONAR, Matt Smith, and APeX were good, and Jesus Christ personally rocked each and every of the 2,100 who attended. Some people got a lot of stuff signed, and I got one really good book for dealing with anti-Catholic Fundamentalists, whom I'll put up with some other time.  Yesterday, I went swimming in the grace of the Holy Spirit and blew my chances of returning to the Devil's world.  Today, return home. I've been drifting around since I got home, not really willing to go anywhere but still searching for something to deepen my spirituality. I settled on an hour or two of chatting with some friends about an exorcistic (sic) experience and reading about all of the trials and tribulations of my brothers in Christ on this blog.  I am thinking about forming some serious plans for the rest of my life, though. I don't really have any money so I'll probably pray to God for discernment of my vocation and hang out.  Not much new in the world today. Important sinners are badmouthing God on MTV, the weak people of the world are responding with the usual half-efforts and turns from the Truth, and the 12 "undecided" in whether God is real and worth it make plans to move to Hell.  (lets hope they will turn to Jesus for the eternal salvation he offers all of us)  Well, Christ has now forgiven the hellish sins out of me. I have many plans, and I am no longer content to while away the rest of the summer in obscurity, I hopefully won't. I could've did some things differently, but too late for that now, so why second-guess myself? Why am I speaking of my life like it is already over? Adulthood hasn't even started yet, and I celebrate the end of my sin after every reconciliation.  I kind of want to see Godspell and The Passion of the Christ. By which I kind of want to see I mean I will if there is nothing better to do. Now that I think of it, I thank God for today. Tomorrow, I also could read these books I bought. I've got 2-3 waiting to be read. Anyway, I can't say I am interested in blogging at the moment.  See ya next time I feel like it.  Even though I'm not really interested in blogging, I continue to do so. I've experienced a profound surrender in my life at the Steubenville North Youth Conference, and I hope everyone is open to my sharing of the wonderful love and state of grace I am living in right now.  For God so loved the world that he gave His  only son , that we might not perish, but have life eternal. May the peace of our Lord and Savior be with all of you. Good night and God bless.
