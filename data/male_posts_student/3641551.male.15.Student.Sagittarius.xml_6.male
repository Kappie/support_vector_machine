It isn't that hard to guess who it is but frankly I hate all teachers.  As for the three Leong's, they are okay except for their teaching methods and apparent dislike of me. Unlike Mr Wong Mun Chong who apparently assaulted me and beat me up to a pulp just for answering an extremely difficult A-Level Chemistry question wrongly.   But let's not talk about teachers shall we.   I broke the new class fan on the first day of school... Not to mention tearing apart the ceiling in the process. Okay I'm exaggerating. I just tore apart a section of the ceiling. Then we had to lie to Mr Niana that the fan was malfunctioning from the start. Sadly he saw through our ruse and told Mr Ismail who scolded the class the next morning. They didn't  sabo  me,  which was highly surprising considering I come from a highly dysfunctional class.   School proceeded uneventfully with the normal fighting, squabbling, bra-pulling and egg smashing that has become commonplace in 403.   That was until a few days ago where I stupidly ran my mouth off like nobody's business and lied to a few people. Now half the class won't trust me and I would like to say sorry again...   Oh well... Back to more recent topics, we had a chemistry motivational test yesterday that was reasonably manageable. However I still don't know how in the world it is supposed to be motivational in any way. After that we played soccer where I performed a much sub-par performance to my irritance.   Going to take a short nap now before going to visit my grandma's place with my parents.   Maybe I'll study tonight... Maybe...
