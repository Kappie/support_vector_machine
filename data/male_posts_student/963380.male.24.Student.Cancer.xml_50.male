It's times like this that I pray there is a God, and for that matter, that there's a Satan - just so those bastards are fucking frying eternally, forced to listen to George Dubya's new album "The 100 reasons Americans are better than you and oh yes, we're going to assimilate you all, you dirty pig fuckers". Needless to say, I spent far too much time at work today, mostly holding a certain part of my anatomy, picturing myself anywhere but there. There were some pretty stupid customers today, but going on about that is really like going on about how the ocean is fucking  wet  or how fundamentalist fucknuts need to  die.  All in all, a pleasurable pass time, but thoroughly over done.  I just watched the tail end of Unbreakable on Cable Box (which I promptly stole from John's room last week. Sorry Johnbon, you weren't using it.) Catching that particular portion of Unbreakable is a lot like eating the cream filling of a twinky without having to subject yourself to the rigours of yellow dye number 5. You get the pay off without having to sit through M. Night's brilliant yet preposterously ponderous pacing of plot. I really enjoy Unbreakable and I like M. Night's style of film-making. However, sometimes you really just want to belt him upside the head and tell him to get to the fucking point. It's not like you can just pop in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable and catch a bit. Oh no, you're there for the God Damned  long haul.   Speaking of films that  can  simply be deposited into a dvd player for easy enjoyment of say, a random boulder about to run you the fuck over, or perhaps, the vaporisation of a gang of Nazis (do you have a gang of Nazis? A flock? Flocking Nazis!!! sounds like Hirohito throwing a temper tantrum), apparently Raiders of the Lost Ark is coming to DVD. Apparently Paramount wants to release the movies as a set - while George and Steve want to release them individually with a set coming down the road. I have to side with Paramount on this one - George knows how to fucking dig for cash and it doesn't look like this effort is any different from those in the past. Just give me my original, non Greedo Shoots First Trilogy (aka, the nonfucked version) and some Harrison Ford in fedora and whip. Christ, they're doing it for Back to the Future! (TUESDAY!!!)  Sunday brings us to the watching of Nemesis. Wh00t. Go Jean Luc Go.  That is all.
