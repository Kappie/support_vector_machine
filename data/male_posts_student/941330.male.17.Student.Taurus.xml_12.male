He said I have a cool house  ...very flattering. I poured him a cup full of soda, about 80% of it was fizz. We walked over to the courts --   shhh...don't tell anybody  ...Adam snuck into the women's restroom at Los Cerritos. That's right. It was the first time he did it when old enough to realize how fun/weird it is.   Erik got stung by a bee at Alex's house.   Erik said he thought it was a leaf...that's a very fast-moving, yellow leaf eh? My shot was crazy off but Adam was on fire and Pat...is just Pat.   In a good way of course.   (I wanna play him one on one sometime.)   I had a rematch with Alex that didn't count for anything, I won 12-10.   Yeehaw.   I almost won at 11 with a nice reverse, but oh well. Eugene came to play Pat, he won 11-4 because God forsook Pat. In the meanwhile, me, Adam and Pat (RAP or PAR, whatever floats your boat) played WHORE. Not HORSE, but WHORE. It's   cleaner and more appropriate for us kids  , cuz instead of HO, HOR, and HORS, you have WH, WHO, and WHOR. Erik and Alex left so PAR/RAP had the   laziest game of 21 in recorded history  . Adam won, obviously. He's the legend of lazy, whereas Pat is the prince of procrastina--er...I'll shut up now.
