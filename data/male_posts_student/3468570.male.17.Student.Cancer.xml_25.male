Hehehe...I wonder if the above could be a GP essay, but it would be unfair to those who didn't manage to enter JC during the first three months. Nevertheless, I still wish for such an essay question to emerge so that I can write my best experience of it. Hence, our topic for today would be on the first three months.  Perhaps not many people would miss their first three months at JC, but I do. It was one of the rare eras where I could belong to a group of friends and yet be not neglected too. I have a bunch of acknowledgements I would like to thank for making my first three months enjoyable, and tolerable. This would be put down later on.  Most people in the first three months would have frequent thoughts of withdrawing so that they could enjoy themselves since they had already made plans to enter polytechnic as soon as the O Levels results were out. However, such thoughts never did once crossed my mind. Really. Either I was too absorbed with my socialising, or that I had already planned a route for me to enter another JC later on to continue the syllabus.  The truth is, my friends at SRJC first three months 2004 were one of the rarest ones you could find. Unfortunately, we split up as soon as the period was over, which was some headed to polytechnics while others headed to different JCs each. Perhaps some chose to enter the same JC, but I didn't. And it was such a disappointment that I didn't join two friends who would otherwise be closer to me if I did enter that certain JC.  Many people would be thinking that I'm simply sulking away in YJC due to my 'inability' to socialise there. However, not many seems willing to socialise, and prejudice is rampant in that college. If I had a chance, I would like a time machine to bring me back to 2 January 2004, where I could play my SRJC orientation 2004 again, and enjoy the campfire that the student council had planned for us on the last day of orientation before we headed to lectures and tutorials the next day.  Perhaps I'm a little too overboard...maybe it would be better if I had stopped gloating over such trivial matters. Let me write down some acknowledgements:  Edwin Choo -- Yes! This friend whom I made instantly within a few days, with a rather close friendship as well despite us being put into different tutorial groups after the orientation. During the first few days, I couldn't believe that he would be in this JC 'cause a link had told me that he was supposed to enter NYJC and not SRJC. Nevertheless, I took the chance to made him a friend and success ensued after that. He is now currently in TPJC, and we still do go on outings during the holidays.  Sing Yee -- Another good friend as well. I just do hope that her 'war' with Edwin had ended too. She was also one close friend from SRJC, and was introduced to me through Edwin as well. Initially, I had thought that she was simply sarcastic but her true nature showed later and proved to be a great friend for all too. ((Why do I sound like I'm writing a Friendster testimonial??)) Anyway, this TKGS student has went on to TPJC too, and I'm still apologetic for not agreeing to go to TPJC with her and Edwin when she had recommended me to. =(  Jean -- Oh! The Jurong girl...hehehe...came from Fuhua and surprisingly made it to SRJC so far in the north east. This meant that she nearly had to go across the entire island to meet us at SRJC, but I supposed her close friendship with us also made her tolerate the temptation to withdraw since the travelling distance was super great. And she was also everyone's  best friend , and I stress these words 'cause the way she pronounced were rather of nice meaning. It's agreeable that she's now in JJC, judging from the proximity of her home.  Ying Wen --  You, go away~!  These were the words she blurted out when she had lost her five dollars. Of course, this was not intentional but more of humour. I still bring up this matter when all of us met, and this resulted in laughter. I've got to know her after managing to know much of the class of 1A07 as I continued my frequent socialising with them. And to think I used to call her the brown girl due to her uniform, which resembles NYJC's. Currently in polytechnic, I guess all of us will only meet during the next school break.  Pei Ru -- One of the members whom I managed to know more after the June outing. I was rather surprised that she didn't choose to enter TJC, judging from her score of eleven points. Anyway, I managed to talk to her during the first three months too, since I'd always joined the 1A07 eating corner every break, or free period. I guess she must be studying away in NYJC, and one of the latest which my handphone managed to connect to.   I guess I'll write again soon. As for now, I'll publish these acknowledgements for perhaps them to read.   I still miss my first three months friends.
