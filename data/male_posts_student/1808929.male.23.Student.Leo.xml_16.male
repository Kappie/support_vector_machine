One would think that in med school I wouldn't have time to watch TV; think again. I probably shouldn't be watching TV as much as I am, but I do. I mostly tape shows though and watch them on my own time with friends.       ER is one that I've started watching in the past year. Yeah, it's been on for 10 seasons and I never really payed much attention to it until recently. I think I just like the characters more nowadays. I actually think I have a thing for Maura Tierney, the actress that plays Abby Lockheart. Her character is a nurse who's a 4th year medical student. She's had a whole lot of shit happen to her in the past few years so she's an underdog of sorts. I'm really not sure why I think she's so attractive. Maybe it's because she's somewhat introverted like myself, I'm not sure. Her character has been getting a lot of good episodes lately.      That show does sort of freak me out though. I know ER is fiction, but geez...am I supposed to be able to do all that stuff once I'm in my rotations in a couple years? My first board exams will be June of 2005 which means I'll start studying for those in a year! All this stuff is going way too fast.    Song of the day Radiohead, "Morning Bell" 2000.
