I'm glad I did not get a v6 or a v8 with these outrageous gas prices.  For those of you who don't know about my car it is a 2000 Saturn SL2.  It's a 125 HP DOHC 4-cylinder and has more power than my mom's Ford Taurus G, 130 HP SOHC V-6, and gets way better gas mileage.  To keep track of your gas mileage I would suggest using  urlLink TotalCar 6.0 for the Palm Pilot  (freeware) or if you do not have a palm pilot I suggest using  urlLink New Jersey Gas Prices .  If you are not from New Jersey do not worry.  They have a webpage, database, and fuel log for every state.  I would highly recommend checking out these resources to keep up upon your gas mileage as well as if the digital pumps are working correctly.  So when you go to the gas pumps bring a pencil and paper and write down the following.  » Odometer Miles » Price per gallon (ie. 1.879) yes the 9 at the end is important. » Total amount paid » How many gallons they have pumped (be exact)  If you look at my fuel log image above you can see the weird MPG trend.  I could have been getting bad gas mileage because I waited almost 1,000 more miles to get it changed.  After I got it changed my miles per gallon went up by around 5.  So it pays to maintain your car!
