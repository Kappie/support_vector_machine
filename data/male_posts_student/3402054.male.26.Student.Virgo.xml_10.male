First, the Exam itself spans three days. Second, the testing time ranges from three to six hours each day. Third, the Bar rewards those who steadily work practice MBE problems. Finally, and most important of all to me, students often master certain subjects only days (or hours) before the exam begins.  Though I concentrated in six areas of law, I never had courses in Civil Liberties, Secured Transactions, Commercial Paper (a.k.a. Negotiable Instruments), or Oil  Gas. The Exam covered all of these areas heavily, including the first  entire  Oil  Gas question in five years. I had not read any of the BarBri reviews for essays until about one week before the exam (a mistake). Thus, I learned the basics of Secured Transactions and Commercial Paper during the all-nighter study-fest before Day 3 began.  I was woefully unprepared in certain respects. Though I took BarBri and PMBR's practice MBE's, I  never  worked a single practice problem outside of those practice exams. My MBE score was last measured (scaled) around 131, and given the lapse of time between practice and test time, the score may have dropped. As for Civil and Criminal Procedure, another all-nighter produced a remarkable performance on the Day 1 Procedure  Evidence portion of the Bar. I realized the advantage of Baylor when I zoomed through that exam, though I would have failed without the all-nighter. The Multistate Performance Test hardly merits mention. One confession: I never read Oil  Gas, never attended its BarBri course, never read its Conviser portion, never read the long form outline, and never took the class. I have never prepared more with less time for such an important test. I only can hope I passed.  Now I enjoy a road trip across Texas with my friends from college. Matt from San Francisco, Will from Cambridge, and David from New York all flew into Texas for my Baylor Law graduation. I wake to a wonderful view from the Hilton in downtown Austin. My friends tell me to quit blogging, shower, and hit the road. I am off to complete our journey.
