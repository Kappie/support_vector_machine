I was in shock and disbelief and for many reasons. First off Lets talk about this Illinois National guardsman. From reports that I have read, The American pilot that killed the Canadians was some what of a hot dog. He had poor training records, Seamed to not really take orders well and was all around a bad Airman. What we call in the Air Force a D.B.A. (Dirt Bag Airman) So tell me why is it that this guy is getting off? So now lets talk about the air time that this story is getting. That is the other thing that is pissing me off. Now lets be honest how many of you read that ticker all the way through? There is like 15-20 minutes worth of information that scrolls across at an ungodly slow rate. So you get impatient and then don't read it. I strongly feel that there should have been more information on that. Talk about the  family's  that this effected, Talk about why the National Guard Pilot   got off.   That family is not going to get anything in return except form the Canadian government for the death of a son, Father, brother, or a husband. That family should get more. More because that SOB/D.B.A. disobeyed orders flew back and took them out even after he was told that he was not to go back there. I hope that everynight that pilot sleeps he he's haunted buy the lives that he took.  urlLink
