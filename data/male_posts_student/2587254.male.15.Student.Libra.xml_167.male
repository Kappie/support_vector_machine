Yeah with summer coming in out with books and papers and stuff and in with basketball, golf, and if I still know how...breakdance. Geez I haven't done that in almost 3 months now that I think about it. I wonder if I can do anything still...  My relaxing day started off at 11:30am....a HUGE change from school, and started with some music listening. Yeah why not waste time when I can =P. To think that when I woke up exam kids were already up for over 3 hours. Muahahahaha...killing time rules =). And so heading downstairs I check email, MSN, and then played some NSFU. Yeah not much to do today, since most of my friends still are in exams, or studying...or something. And so quickly grabbed some lunch, and then finally decided to go to UCC. I haven't done anything athletic in a while....so start now haha..  And getting there I start off playing some ball. Played some 3v3....but yeah I kinda died from lack of physical activity over last two months. So after an hour of ball, I decided to go work out then....since I haven't done that either in over 3 months lol. So yeah after doing that for an hour I was dead tired...so went home haha.  So for a while played EE, tromboned, then Jason called for more UCC. Meh why not? So yeah I got ready and then after some food and more trombonin', headed down to UCC.  Heh for some reason there was lots of fighting between the people playing ball today. Over the things from fouls, to travels, even people on the same team were arguin'. Also saw Ken and some other LCACers there, so played some baddy since bball courts were kinda fuller than in the daytime *THIS IS WHY YOU GO TO UCC IN THE DAYTIME JASON.* Well yeah after some of that played a one on one game of ball against Jason, which I claim victory winning 7-4 or something like that. Also...on top of that beautiful win, TWO BLOCKS! HAH!  Anyways yeah back home...gotta finish some more trombonin', talkin on MSN, and stuff... Trying to figure out when the whole6crew will meet in summer along w/ other TCers and of course the usual London people featuring David that come along with me to Paramount haha.  Anyways I'm out. Cheers to all of summer kids =).  Later.
