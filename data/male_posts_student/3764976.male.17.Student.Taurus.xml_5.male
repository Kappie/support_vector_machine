That's right, before Senses Fail could release an album that's been ready for half a year, they needed more poppier songs for Drive-Thru records to release "Let It Enfold You". How much gayer can a label get in regards to a band's creativity? I don't know how much further anyone can take it. Now, on their new label Vagrant Records, hopefully it will be released in early September. I know that I heard negative things about the new songs, but when I heard them for myself, it sounds like classic Senses Fail. Moving on, Friday night I got to go bowling again for the first time since I went with Blaine a long time ago. It was alright I guess. I just felt out of place for some reason. Almost as if I really don't view my friends as "friends" anymore, just as if I was a body to take up some space. Now, I'll admit that I am usually an attention hog, but for some reason I just wanted to sit back and view everything instead of participating. In a way I just feel like I'm in the way of everything now. Everytime I try to talk to someone, I feel like I'm inconviencing them in some way so I usually don't bother with anyone. Everyone is going on with their lives without me and I guess that I just need to go on with mine without them. No one wants to hang out with me anymore anyway, so I must be the human fun vacuum. Oh well, sucks for everyone else, now like I need anyone besides my band or people who I feel I can trust.
