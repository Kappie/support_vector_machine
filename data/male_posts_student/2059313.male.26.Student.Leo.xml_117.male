       
      Guess what... still helpless.  Why can't I just take and realize my own advice?  I know no matter what profound and inspiring thing I may come up with, it won't mean a damn bit as much as me just being there.  That's all I can do, or at least that's all I know to do.  I'm sorry I can't do more, friend.
