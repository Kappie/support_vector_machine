The best part of this song was they would play it all throughout the movie but in diferent languages, and by the way, WATCH IT, it is funny.  So here are the lyrics:  Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me do it in my van every Sunday. She tells him she's in church, but she doesn't go. Still she's on her knees And Scotty doesn't know.   Oh, Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty  Fiona says she's out shopping, But she's under me and I'm not stopping.  Cause Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty Scotty doesn't know So don't tell Scotty  I can't believe he's so trusting While I'm right behind you thrusting Fiona's got him on the phone And she's trying not to moan It's a three-way call And he knows nothing Nothing  Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  don't tell Scotty Cause Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know So don't tell Scotty We'll put on a show Everyone will go Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  The parking lot Why not? It's so cool when you're on top. His front lawn  In the snow Life is so hard Cause Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  I did her on his birthday...  Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know Scotty doesn't know  Scotty doesn't know so don't tell Scotty Scotty doesn't know  Scotty will know Scotty has to know Scotty's gotta know Gonna tell Scotty  Gonna tell him myself Scotty has to know Scotty has to know Scotty has to Scotty has to  Scotty has to go  Scotty doesn't know (Repeat 6X) Scotty doesn't Scotty doesn't  Scotty doesn't know  Scotty doesn't know (Repeat 8X) Scotty's gotta go  Lustra-Scotty Doesn't Know
