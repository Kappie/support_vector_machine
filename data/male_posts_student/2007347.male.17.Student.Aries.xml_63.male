He was the mind behind a lot of the most memorable music from the Matrix, (try saying that 5 times fast) including Clubbed to Death, Everyone knows that song, when they hear it.Although, his style of music doesn't really fit into any category. And he can't sing. Seriously. Check him out if you've got nothing else to get off Kaaza. (i do not codone such activities) Anyway, Here's the lryics to  There's Only Me,  off the  Furious Angels  Album.  You're all I want   You're all I need   You're all I've gotAll I see  It won't be long   'Til suddenly   You'll find he's gone   And you'll turn around and see There's only me   For whom there's silence in your heart   There's only me   Waiting patient to the last   You wait and see   One day your love will surely start   You'll turn around   You'll find when everyone departs, there's only me You walk in the room   You take you seat   You don't turn around   You don't see me    I'll make him    goYou'll find one day he'll disappear   You'll turn around   And find that not a soul is here  There's only me    Only me there's only me you wait and see    you'll turn around you'll find when everyone departs    there's only me
