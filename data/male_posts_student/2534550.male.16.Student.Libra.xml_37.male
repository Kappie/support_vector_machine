Jerry Seawright made that happen.   He died on a day fitting, as the founder of the Blue Devil Drum and Bugle Corps. Both Blue Devils "A" and Blue Devils "B" had a camp on Sunday, May 16th, and were wrapping up successful rehearsals as Mr. Seawright passed.   I'm not about to write an entry telling how much this man meant to me, hell, I barely knew him, and I've been brought to tears. I tried on the  urlLink Blue Devils Forums  to express my sadness, and I am in no state to go through that mental anguish again.   Jerry, my camp, my season, my year, my drum corps carreer is for, and because of you. Thank you, for creating the organization you did. Thank you so much, thank you in ways I could never begin to express. I've never loved and devoted myself to any one thing, as I have with the Blue Devils, and I fell I've chose the right thing to dedicate myself to, an exceptional, high class group, your dream.   We're your future, Mr. Seawright, and we're sure as hell going to carry it through. You're the ultimate age-out, you'll never be replaced.     urlLink http://bluedevils.org/about/jerryseawright/
