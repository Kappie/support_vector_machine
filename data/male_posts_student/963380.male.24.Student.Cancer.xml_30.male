Movies have a long and storied history of being turned into video games. There's a general consensus on the results. Most of the tripe generated sucks more than your average black hole. For the sake of brevity, I won't include comic book/movie adaptations and their subsequent sequel dynamics; well, for the sake of brevity and the fact that there's only so much band width to go around.  When I discuss movie/videogame adaptations, I do make several exceptions for what I like to call "The Hybrids" - Movies about videogames in general - Wargames, Tron, The Wiz. While all of these films have a certain level of suck attributed to them and their cheese factor has garnered them endorsements from the diary council of Canada - we love them nonetheless. For the few, the proud, the elite - (read: Children of the Eighties) these films were our childhood and we won't stand for anyone fucking around with them.  Incidently, reheated popcorn chicken r0xors my b0x0rs and burns the roof of my mouth. Sweet sweet pain.  So back to the biggest mistakes made by Hollywood/Silicon Valley. Perhaps the most telling example is based on the most well known video game of all time - Super Mario Brothers. The english language, while rife with terms synonymous with shit, simply can not map the breadth and scope of the suckage of this film. It takes a lot to make Dennis *fucking* Hopper look stupid. In the case of this film, mission accomplished with an hour to spare.  It's equally difficult to take Angelina "My lips obviously crave wang" Jolie, put her in tight shorts and give her a pair of guns and make it gobble chode with plenty of teeth. However, Tomb Raider - Das Flick managed it.   Tomb Raider and Mario both have plots; albeit the plots are meagre. Save the Princess. Find the lesbian lover - er... treasure.   PAC MAN IS ABOUT EATING FUCKING DOTS AND CHASING GHOSTS.     FOR NO REASON OTHER THEN THEY ARE THERE.   feck. With all the factories in the states churning out weapons and bullets, we still haven't been able to eliminate the one species on this planet that's fucking it up for the rest of us.  Dumb studio execs.
