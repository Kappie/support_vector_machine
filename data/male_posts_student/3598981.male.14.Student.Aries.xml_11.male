We spent most of the time drawing loads of circles and then drawing shapes in them and measuring the angles. It was kinda good because i made up wit my friend nicola which was good!  Period 3 = French - We spent 20mins looking over french words for a vocab test. I got 9.5/10 which was good for me!  Period 4 = Geo - GRRR this was the most annoying period all day because our normal teacher wasnt there so i had to sit becide a load of people who i dont like and they HATE me. I knew they where talking about me because they where talking really loud on purpose. Then they started to flick hit me with various objects which got really annoyin. I really felt alone in that period!  BREAK - Break was fine, i had a packet of crips, a doughnut and a drink of apple juice and i talked to nicola and sarah.  Period 5 = History - The Easter Rising. Not very exciting. THe exciting part was talking about the death sentance, our teacher knows a lot about that, which is very worrying!  Period 6 = English - We where watchin the Animal Farm video. Just alot of animals talking and making animal sounds. It was funny to see ross get somethin flicked a point blank range on his cheek and watching him yelp in pain HAHAHAHA!  LUNCH - Same old stuff - Went to the Silver Robin (the canteen. its a better name than the Bangor Grammers one.) Nicola sat on my knee and nearly broke everybone in my legs because he butt is so boney! A lot of Pepsi was split all over the table.  Period 7 = French - We got sweets and lolly pops, and then worked a loy!  Period 8 = History - Making a poster about Proabition, not very exciting.  Perion 9+10 = H.E - We watched a video about the making of the Tomb Raider advert. We have to design our own advert.  While I was walking down the drive to the bus I was speaking to a teacher about the J.John meeting at Hamilton Road Presbyterian. She thought it was very good. She is presbyterian.  The bus trip home went really fast today for some unknown reason.   So thats my boring and unexciting day at school!  Enjoy!
