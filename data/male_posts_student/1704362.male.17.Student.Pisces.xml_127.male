You will submit something, to the Illiterary Magazine. We will take ANY credited submission, and it will be published at the end of the year. I don't care if you can't write, can't draw, can't sing, or can't think.    Submission Ideas:     Paste Architectural Digest magazines to your cat, and take pictures of it.  Make the next Great American Film. Unravel the tape, then bake it at 350 for 4 hours with cajun seasoning.  Draw pictures of those around you as if they were inside-out.  Arrange a gangster rap for the ukelele.  Write an epic poem about the Forgotten Body Part.  Perform a cover of the Soviet National Anthem on kazoos.  Copy a few pages from your least favorite text book, then splice them together in obscene ways using the library copy machine.    These are only guidelines. Remember to keep your mind open... see a Cupola Standard staff member or email your submissions to  urlLink nervestaple@gmail.com .
