On a random note demon-matt got upgraded today to the level of Lucifer, not far now until he becomes a fully fledged Devil. Well doneth him. Yesteryear saw matt retire to a pleassant little eatery delightfully decorated with the title Donnateloes, In Brighton, whereupon i did sup upon a Pizza large enough to satisfy even the most hairy chested of us...you all know who i mean! whilst in said delicious restaurant we did recive humble entertainment from that escaped lunatic otherweise known in dramatic circles as Christopher Davey. Nuff Said. Anywho i musteth away, for mym suitcase is beckoning me to fill it with joyous tat. Fair thee well my impish servants of the goated one. Matteth.
