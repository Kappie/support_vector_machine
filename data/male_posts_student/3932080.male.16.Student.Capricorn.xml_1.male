We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #3: Lil’ Jon    000000000        Write Up    Bursting onto the scene with the irrestistable “Get Low,” Lil’ Jon went from being an underground no-name (with the infamous  Lil’  moniker) to a household pop culture icon. He soon was parodied by  Dave Chappelle , one of the truest signs that you’ve made it, as he continued to produce into 2004. Since 1997, he and group  the Eastside Boyz  have made geographically-limited crunk rap, mixing party spirits with arena beats. It wasn’t until 2003 when he started to produce for up-and-coming Southern groups, but he soon had a firm grasp on the  Billboard  charts, exercising the right to take dancefloors by the neck whenever he released a new track. Maybe one of the keys to his success was appearance, looking like a brother of  Cousin Itt  who stumbled into a rap career because he could wake comatose victims with his rasp. Jon seems the perfect player to get a party started, whether you want him on the vocals or on the beat, both of which he’s proved capable of. A  Grammy  for this young producer would be astonishing, but he’s definitely in the running. Consistently putting out new tracks this year, he seems to be at his highest work ethic to date, unselfishly dishing out some backbeats that he knows will burn up the charts. Those backbeats are extremely recognizable, sometimes just because Lil’ Jon throws his own voice into the mix with traditional  yeahs ,  whats , and  heys . If you like to dance, Lil’ Jon is your go-to man, never failing to ignite the boogying spark. Whether or not he can pick up the  Producer(s)   Grammy  is questionable, but keeping the world in motion is one hell of a consolation.

Lil’ Jon   (#84)   ooooo0  Quick to Back Down - Bravehearts      Career Blotches     Damn! - Youngbloodz   (#4)  In 2003, one of  Lil’ Jon’s  go-to Southern duos (a subset including the  Ying Yang Twins  and  Bravehearts ) burst onto the scene boasting “We don’t give a damn, we don’t give a fuck!” Over a key-changing string line and a simply engineered drum loop, the world was introduced to two of the Dirty South’s newest dentist-pleasers, mouths blinged and words crunked. Yes, the single hit the #4 spot on the  Billboard Hot 100 . Yes, the success of “Damn!” was able to propel the Youngbloodz debut release,  Drankin’ Patnaz , to the #5 spot on the  Billboard 200 . And yes, the song will guarantee interest in the group’s future misspellings. But I don’t give a damn, and I don’t give a fuck. This track is a mid-tempo mess, abandoning high-speed party rap for laid-back rasping in the vein of  Bone Crusher  (most notably on his brilliant “Never Scared”), but neither member of the Bloodz packs half of his fright. Being a first single, all the world wanted was a taste. Unfortunately, the Youngbloodz barked, but they didn’t bite.   Salt Shaker - Ying Yang Twins feat. Lil’ Jon  the Eastside Boyz   (#9)  Using a bouncing bass and club percussion,  Lil’ Jon  tried to rewrite “Get Low” with the Ying Yang Twins’ “Salt Shaker.” Regrettably, this track may have finally turned women against  Lil’ Jon’s  producing career. After all, since bursting onto the scene by demanding that the ladies “get low,” he continued by commanding them to “shake that monkey” (a  Too $hort  single) and now to “shake it like a salt shaker.” Visit any  Surgeon General  and he’ll tell you that shaking your monkey while you’re already getting low and salt-shaking will cause some urban hospital visits, if not death. On top of that,  Jon’s  beat is repetitive and lax, reaching a climax only when spiced with some flute trills during the song’s chorus. Marking this club hit as the end of an era,  Lil’ Jon  started to shine away from heavy-crunk ruckus anthems, producing new-sounding music in 2004. Good thing too, because if he didn’t stop there then every baby momma would have back problems.     Career Highlights     Get Low - Lil’ Jon  the Eastside Boyz   (#2)  “Get Low” is easily the best and most original single to come out of the Dirty South underground. Lil’ Jon’s remarkable production makes the track; he could get paraplegics dancing with the arena static bass line, the garage synth attack, and, most memorably, the melody-mimicking lollipop brigade (heard when the Eastsiders pepper the music with dum-dum-dums). This track takes all the likable elements of crunk (rabble-rousing vocals, a vicious but danceable beat, and head-occupying catchphrases) to an artistic peak for the genre, culminating in millions of club-goers violating fire hazards by leaning towards the nearest window and, subsequently, the nearest wall. Actually, the fine lady that inspired some of this party babble was only a 9, evidence being a memorable lyric. That’s right; she was only “standing real fine.” Just think of what Jon and the Boyz could have done if she was a perfect ten.     2004 Mentionable Tracks (Potential Grammy Material)     Jook Gal - Elephant Man feat. Lil’ Jon   (#57)  If “Yeah!” was crunk R, then this is crunk dancehall. Taking that incessant coolie skank riddim beat (also used in  Nina Sky’s  “Move Ya Body” and then  Pitbull’s  “Culo”) to its limit,  Lil’ Jon  and Elephant Man swapped the mic back and forth to see who could out-holler who. The winner? No one. Dancehalls and dancefloors alike quickly pushed this track out of rotation, not letting it achieve nearly the success of previous  Lil’ Jon  dance productions (reaching only the #57 spot on the  Billboard Hot 100 ). By 2004, the world was tired of Jamaican jibber-jabber (thanks  Sean Paul ) and  Lil’ Jon  boogie hits (thanks casual sex), a duo of problems that ultimately killed this track before anyone even heard it.   Yeah! - Usher feat. Ludacris and Lil’ Jon   (#1)  Mapped out by Ludacris in the final words of this track, “Yeah!” put together the hottest soul singer (Usher, “the voice”), the loudest party roaster (Lil’ Jon, “the beat”) and the naughtiest lyrical prankster (Ludacris, “the flow”) for one of this century’s sickest club songs. And, most importantly, each member can make your booty go [insert whip crack here]. All that considered, though, it seems necessary to point out how Lil’ Jon pulled a fast one on the world with this #1 smash. All he did was reverse the string line from the  Youngbloodz'  “Damn!” from   low-higher, low-high   to   low-high, low-higher   for the “Yeah!” beat (listen to the tracks to see what the fuck I mean). In fact, the second half of “Yeah!”s infamous opening synth line is the exact same beat pattern as featured in “Damn!” Then, Jon shipped off the single, labeled it his “first crunk-meets-RB production,” and dropped 2004’s biggest jam. Hell, we should have seen it coming; “Yeah!” and “Damn!,” two one-word exclamatory hits penned by king of crunk Lil’ Jon, released less than a year apart. I could stay nit-picky and continue to bitch about how lucky Jon is that the world has a weak ear for similarity, but let’s face it: The buzz-saw synth stabs, echoed keyboard shakes, and fluttering pan flutes make for one hell of a beat, reused or not, to play beneath Usher’s unforgettably contemplative vocals and Ludacris’s life-of-the-party flow. Crunk’s finest may have fooled us, but at least he provided a soundtrack.   Freek-A-Leek - Petey Pablo   (#7)  Both the  Neptunes  and  Timbaland  still sound fresh with every single that they produce, even with the occasional misstep, like the  Neptune’s  light synth pop of  Jay-Z’s  “Change Clothes” at the close of 2003.  Lil’ Jon , on the other hand, produced a total of two 2004 singles before turning stale, namely  Usher’s  “Yeah!” and this song, Petey Pablo’s “Freek-A-Leek.” The two productions are devastatingly similar; they are both based around a looped synth-buzz line, they both hit vibrating spoons in the otherwise minimal percussion section, they both use haywire flutes to mimic any singing, they both have a chorus that drops the title on the first beat of every measure, and they both have barely audible bass lines used only to reinforce the instrumentation. Perhaps the most blatant evidence of this equivalence is the two couplets dropped in each song, one by  Ludacris  (“Take that and rewind it back/Lil’ Jon got the beat that make your booty go…”) and one by Pablo (“Would ya do it from the front, would ya take it from the back/Gonna break it down like that”). The only thing that makes “Freek-A-Leek” original is its subject matter and rapped verses, which are average at best (save Pablo’s ghetto name laundry-listing in the chorus, the song’s one highlight). In all fairness to Petey, “Freek-A-Leek” would have been much bigger had its release date preceded that of “Yeah!,” but one might get the feeling that Pablo was too busy acquiring diseases to notice this.   Culo - Pitbull feat. Lil’ Jon   (#32)  Recycling the same coolie skank riddim from  Elephant Man’s  “Jook Gal,” Lil’ Jon added some Latin flavor to craft Pitbull’s “Culo.” With a chorus that Americans couldn’t understand (something that seems to draw us in, citing as evidence  Eiffel 65’s  “Blue”), Jon mixed the dancehall drumming with some demented flutes for the best track to use that incessant rhythm (even trumping  Nina Sky’s  “Move Ya Body”). Maybe speaking less to dancing, more to personal hygiene (key lyric: “If you shave I'll give you some of this mighty tongue”), Pitbull broke out of an ethnic mold to hit crossover success with “Culo.” The best part of the track seems to be its haywire performance, sounding like the audio equivalent to street basketball, without fouls or bounds. Remembering Lil’ Jon’s “Yeah!,”  Ludacris  pointed out how he wanted “a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed.” In opposition to that, the guys of Pitbull announced their want for a “freak, a monster in bed, last thing I need is a lady.” Finally, a group that makes it seem like Ludacris is a classy guy.   Goodies - Ciara feat. Petey Pablo   (currently #15)  Introducing a young new artist by pairing her with hip-hop’s current most-horny lyricist,  Lil’ Jon  gave Ciara a club hit with “Goodies.” ’04 Bonnie  Clyde? No, more like updated R. Kelly  victim. While Petey blathers away about how he could have sex with the planet in three months (do I see the sequel to  Around the World in 80 Days  in  Disney’s  future?), Ciara plays the innocent side chick who won’t give up her goodies to just anyone. Jon’s beat may sound futuristic, but its more outdated. Those techno squeaks came right out of  Timbaland’s  scrapbook (remember  Missy’s  “Work It?), and that sugary guitar honey has been in use for years. Still, the track is intriguing, as Ciara perfectly contraries Petey’s gruffness with high-pitched virginity squeals. The production, just to be frank, is what holds this track down. The individual performances are stellar.
