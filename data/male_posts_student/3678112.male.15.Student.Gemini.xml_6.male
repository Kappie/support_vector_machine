The gameplay, which many first-person shooter veterans got accustomed to, is also subject to change. However, it won't be changed more than it will be necessary to plunge gamer into DOOM III world. Take this in-game moment for example: you pace along the corridor, recovering after a scuffle with zombies and all of a sudden notice a huge shadow materializing before your eyes (another advantage of the technological revolution behind the game -- lighting effects and true shadows allow for detecting enemies long before direct contact). Assuming you have run out ammo, you skip to the saving darkness and pray to shrink. Heavy steps approach and you behold giant monster, hellish hybrid of demon and robot. It takes a stroll down the corridor, then halts and slowly turns around, getting used to the smell. Its eyes are gleaming in dark (this moment gave me shivers). Luckily it didn't notice your presence and continues his walk, grumbling and scratching the floor covering with its metallic claws. "We provide certain freedom of choice, just as we do with the storyline", - says Jean Paul von Waveren, id Software's programmer. "Whether to jump out in a frenzy shooting spree or to evade enemies and go different way, saving ammo and health, is for player to decide."   Monsters in DOOM III, as I already mentioned, stun with their awesome graphical appearance and smooth animations (which cannot be conveyed by static screenshots). However, there's always a room for complaint: can it be another Unreal, where enemies are scarce but trained specially to wage prolonged duels with player? "Of course not", - comments id's Mal Blackwell. "This is DOOM! We are not going to mimic Serious Sam where player is exposed to relentless attacks by hordes of identical enemies. Monsters will be more than adequate, sometimes they'll attack in tens, sometimes they poke around alone. We want player not to be aware of what's behind the next door, so that he would be up to storm the front every second of play. DOOM III is all about pressure and terror." Charming! Doom's conception is alive, and it has risen onto a new level. But what hardware is required to render tens of highly detailed monsters simultaneously? "The trick is in the extensive use of bump-mapping," says Jim Dose as he winks. "The characters are not REALLY high-polygonal, but the bump-mapping provides proper picture. This is how we intended to cram tens of monsters onscreen without damaging performance. By the way, let me give you a piece of advice regarding hardware configuration: you won't see what DOOM's like on video cards below GeForce 3. With per-pixel lighting and bump-mapping turned off, you just won't see DOOM III. Yes, the game can be run on GeForce 1, but my urgent message is as follows: go buy GeForce 3 or better".   While talking on the plethora of monsters in DOOM III, Mal Blackwell mentioned that the game will incorporate a number of already recognized monsters (the movie exposed zombie, pinky demon, imp, flying skulls, and cyber-demon), and of course plenty of new creatures. However, some of the cast that made it from the first installments of Doom are totally renovated, as renowned imp (that disgusting brown ape casting fireballs) now looks as a transmuted chimp. Ugly salivating mug, hairy arms and habits of the primate. If you are closer than three meters at the beast, it would drop a curtsey, and then jump at you, trying to slit your throat open (however, its fireball skill remained untouched). "Yes, our animator Fred Nilsson is a pure genius", -- says Jim Dose. "He was previously working in Hollywood, and worked on "Shrek". His ability to inhale life into any incredible creature has long become a legend. We are very happy to have him working over DOOM III with us".   Yet another itchy question regards AI. Will monsters stick to the sheer numbers tactics? "Not quite so", Jean Paul Waveren comments. "We shall have various creatures, both stupid and smart, and they will perform differently. I can say our monsters are credible. What that means? Imagine yourself approaching a man on the street and asking him what time is it. You don't expect him to dance jig or recite Shakespeare's selected stanza. That's what our monsters are - they will act like real creatures. They won't hole up around the level or talk to their mates through radio. Their objective is to kill every living being, and your fear attracts them. That's their natural pattern of behavior, and they all attack in a different way, according to their savage ruses".   Another shocking information on DOOM III character cast. While talking to Mal Blackwell on the game's plot, I couldn't but pose a question on the probable introduction of NPCs. "Yes, there will be NPCs in DOOM III", - assured Mal. "They won't be many (look for yourself, how many survivors can there be given that hordes of blood-thirsty monsters are crawling around the Martian base?). However, on your way you will encounter characters whom you can interact with. They can even demand your help (like getting them food or killing a particular monster that occupied their residence), and reveal you a door to the secret room or give out valuable ammo in return. Actually, it's not a significant part of the game, and we need it to reinforce the game's credibility".   According to Mal's words, DOOM III will span around thirty levels (probably a bit more). They will be really huge, and will be constructed to convey the pressing atmosphere of fear and terror, where you oppose Evil and you have no idea what's there around the corner. "Building levels for DOOM III is a really hard work", - says Jim Dose. "The point is that we use a great deal of special effects, which previously were the cinema's privilege, like shadows and lights. This is why we must pay special attention to architecture details, decorating, sources of light, even furniture - as everything must serve our goal: scare the player as hell. This is where we get the most effect from our physics system, which is Jean Paul's domain".   Physical laws exploited in the game are aiming to be closer to reality than the reality seems to be. When you shoot shelves where boxes and lumber are stored, you can "see" bullet burst through the stuff, slam into the wall and rebound. The box hops with the impact, turns over and falls down on the floor. The scene looks terrific. Another striking example is shooting zombies at stairs. When you have used up the magazine for one of these meat bags, it would drop down and roll over downstairs, carefully mimicking the accurate evolutions of "real-life" corpse.   Moreover, according to Jim Dose, DOOM III won't be confined within narrow corridors and rectangular rooms of military base. Did they opt for the outdoor areas and huge sceneries of Mars? "Yes, that's right", - says Jim, - "we plan a number of outdoor levels. I'm not going to reveal you precise number of indoor and outdoor areas. Don't want to spoil the impression. Actually, implementing open-air levels is not our primary purpose. They won't be more than needed, and we are not willing to churn them out just because its flashy these days".   Last but not least point of Doom III is its multiplayer ingredient. What do we see there? "We are trying to create unforgettable and revolutionary singleplayer game", - Jim Dose says. "That's why we plan only a simple deathmatch for DOOM III. However, new modes of play are likely to appear afterwards, but I can't state anything for sure right now. Our primary and foremost objective is to create a stunning singleplayer experience, and we employ all possible and impossible technological attainments glued with immersive plot to achieve proper result".   Before I could put my eyes on DOOM III, I feared that the impression which formed after watching MacWorld Expo and GDC videos will vanish away. I was almost sure that my expectations to see a really scary and dismal horror game would be shattered. I thought I'd be presented with just another first person shooter. But it turned out that id's veterans are not trying to live up to the hype, they are going much further. DOOM III is not a next id's game. It is a true revolution, on a par with first Doom or intellectual upheaval of Half-Life. Jim Dose is thousand times right: DOOM III is precisely what Doom should be. It's time for a total upgrade and agonizing suspense for 2003.
