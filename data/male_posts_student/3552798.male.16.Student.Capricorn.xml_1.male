I can go on and on about Joe. and get this! hes not all about sex like most other guys! THANK YOU! i think im finally gonna have my first good relationship. and he said the exact same thing. neither one of us has had a good one yet. and he already knows that i wont do anything to hurt him and i know he wont to me either. so its perfect. well i should probably stop typing on this so i can go talk to him! ill update more later! I LOVE YOU JOEY BABY! (umm oh yea..thanks aaron! :-D)
