I'm kind of looking for to Summer Band because I'll get to see everyone, but I'm not looking forward to it cuz i don't feel like practicing eight hours everyday! I guess I'll have to get over it.. there's nothing I can do about that..cuz i guess it'll pay off at Nationals! wooo      I'm officially sick of my Rock/Pop playlist.. I've listened to Simple Plan way too much.. so now i'm sick and tired of it.. and I don't feel like listening to Classical music.. so I guess I'm stuck with rock.. unless I wanna listen to Hip-Hop and Rap.. not really.. hmm.. maybe i'll find some cool music in the next few days..      Tomorrow we're gonna find out what its like to be without Margie :-( but there's nothing I can do about that.. Well i guess it won't really be tomorrrow.. cuz last year she missed summer band.. so I guess when school starts we'll really know that Margie's gone..      I've started To Kill a Mockingbird.. it takes FOREVER to read!! lol can't do anything about it.. I'm on like page 15.. something about Boo Radley.. i think thats the neighbors nephew or something.. don't really remember.. I should read somemore :-P I don't want to though! at least we don't have to read ALL of the books on the list over the summer.. the summer that ends tomorrow! NO!!!! but we'll still have weekends.. and I'm going to AstroWorld! and hopefully to see The Village.. I wanna ride SWAT! that ride is soooo awesome.. you should ride it sometime.      I'm probably boring you to death.. but thats OK! I'm having fun typing.. i guess... kinda not really.. but its funner than just sitting here staring at the monitor doing nothing..      OOOO a new Degrassi episode on Friday!! and a new Girls v. Boys too! and we get to find out what degrassi stars made it on Girls v. Boys.. w00t!!!!! you should watch these shows sometime.. they are on The-N (Noggin) yup its great.. lalalala      I think thats enough writing for today.. I'll give an update about summer band tomorrow.. yey.. I bet you're looking forward to THAT post. ;);)
