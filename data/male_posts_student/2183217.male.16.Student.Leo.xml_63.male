By the way, if you type .99 cents it's like saying you didn't even spend one PENNY on your grandpa. It's like almost a penny, but not quite. You cheap ungrateful punk.  Oh and for Christmas (I mean, for whatever holiday is going on now besides Christmas) I got a new keyboard. Take that, you old hunk of scraggly plastic that was trying to pass off as a keyboard for God knows HOW long.  Logitech: 1; Old keyboard: 0
