I know she is usually a huge help to me and can make everything easier, but she just didn't seem all that good herself. I'm pretty sure there is something going on with her right now that she doesnt want to tell me, either because she doesn't want to focus on her when she thinks I'm having bigger troubles than w/e it is that is bugging her, or it's something I shouldn't hear. Earlier today I took Zoe to the park. I still don't know where these kids get their energy, or how repetitively going down the same old red slide 100 times can be that much fun. She was afraid to do some of the harder things, but I got her to do them anyways, by the time we were done she would do them by herself. She always looked so proud whenever she did something new by herself, it's pretty cool. Trav left on vacation for a week, and I left my sex-box at his house! Cj's supposed to call me tomorrow and we'll probably figure something out to do. I hope he doesnt think that I'm only going to hang out with him now that Travis left. But maybe that's the truth, I really don't know. I don't want to say that I'm better friends with either Travis or CJ, but I think it actually might be starting to be Trav, but I'm not sure, so don't take that for anything. I had a weird dream last night, I can't remember all of it. I went to a concert in a space ship that was carrying around 25 people, and CJ and Trav were there. There were a few other spaceships going to the same concert, just a sidenote. Well I never actually saw the concert, or don't remember it. Afterwards I was waiting for a long time for CJ and Trav to show up so we could get back on the spaceship and go back. But they never showed and the spaceships were leaving. So I stayed behind and still waited for them. Days went by and new bands were going into the concert hall but still I waited. As soon as I gave up, they showed up. Then the dream ended. I'm havinga hard time interpreting this dream, but it has to mean something. W/e, time to go make more. lol.
