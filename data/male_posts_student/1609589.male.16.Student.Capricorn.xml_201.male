Still, I was impressed with the stratics and team-work of my squad. I'm also glad noone questioned Adam's orders, he's a good "commander," it worked well. I need to get teamspeak. I think i'll play more.  I'll post my "review" on the complex concert tomorrow, or whenever i get it done.  Wow, i forgot how good Train was.
