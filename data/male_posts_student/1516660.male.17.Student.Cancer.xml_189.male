You see, all Science Stream classes needs C-Maths. And the requirements for C-Maths is either a pass for A-Maths, or a distinction in E-Maths and B3 or above for Combined Science. I fulfil neither requirements. Sigh. I was so upset my dreams are dashed. I really hate myself that time. I even thought of suicide, but quickly dahsed the idea from my mind and chiding myself for being crazy. Hann today told me we can take AO-Maths with Chem and Bio! I hope so.....  Erm...today not much happened la. We had about 3 hours of A-Maths with Radha today (6 periods!). He organized extra a-maths class after school for those who need help. We stayed back of course. PeiYing came ('new admission'..Radha called her that...and keep asking if she know how to do problems). I kinda had fun solving the problems. Quite easy ma.....hahaha. Yeah. I am confident about my surds, log and indices le. Meow!!  After that, WQ, me, CQ, Hann and SL went to Civic Centre to study. Well, let me share something with you first. We were teasing WQ about his tendency to cover his ears whenever someone gets too loud. So funny you know. Who would do that one? We were tasing him with things like "protect your ears for what? want to hear yan lor wan's (king of hades) judegement properly ar?" and Hann keep imitating him....hahaha!! Me and CQ keep laughing and laughing. After that, we went to Civic's Centre MacDonalds to study. All fo them did Maths, while I tried to complete my Compre homework. The summary stumped me. I am thinking more abou it tomorrow la.   You know. Wendy made me realize that I have to study to fight for what I want. I want great results at Os, so I can go to the courses I want at JC. I need to plan. I need to start revision now. I think I am planning tomorrow at Wendy's house. Yep. I seriously need to study lor.  I am logging off le. Survivor's gonna show soon. Meow meow! See ya tomorrow, blog! Night.
