Anyways, i just got through 24 hours of having no e-mail and no messenger. i tell you it's torture, specially on a day where it's cold and snowy and i'm the only person at home with nowhere to go. on the plus side i did discover the greatness that is the movie "Killer Klowns from Outer Space" seriously a kick ass movie! cheezy to the core but the Chiodo (sounds almost like Kyoto) brother did a brilliant job of creating a film that's almost as old as me. seriously everyone must see this film. you won't regret it!  -Matt
