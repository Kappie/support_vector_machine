This illegitimate post will be gone next year so better stick with it.  2. There's a chance to fulfill my high school dream (and that's not getting a girlfriend)!!! If things will go well, I may be the EIC next school year??? As explained by Ms. Ma. Cristina Anasta. Oh God, I really need it for college. Being the EIC will fulfill my journalistic dreams!!! My dream? to be a broadcast journalist. Think, Howie Severino and Reporter's Notebook.  3. Abel will be trained. He needs it. Being AE means a lot of responsibilities. A LOT!!!  At least hindi na ako ang mangungulit sa staff. Mwahahahaha!!!   4. Memories. Sol, Tj and me reminisced the old times, singing theme songs from Voltes V, Bioman, Power Rangers, Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon and the like. Forgive us, we have an unfulfilled childhood.  5. My journal. No, not this one, the notebook. Ms. Arboleda already added her own love quote.  Roommates nga sila ni Ms. Anasta. Pakita ko next time.   Darn, I just found that there is an army of ants under my seat. Time to kill!!!
