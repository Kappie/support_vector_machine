How has yours been?   I sang the coolest song in chorus a couple days ago. It's a parody off of The Twelve Days of Christmas. It's not in the original tune of the song at all. When I find a recording of the song, I will post that too. Here, read:  ------------------------------------------------------------ The first day after Christmas  My true love and I had a fight  And so I chopped the pear tree down  And burnt it, just for spite   Then with a single cartridge  I shot that blasted partridge   My true love, my true love, my true love gave to me.    The second day after Christmas   I pulled on the old rubber gloves  And very gently wrung the necks  Of both the turtle doves  My true love, my true love, my true love gave to me.    On the third day after Christmas  My mother caught the croup  I had to use the three French hens  To make some chicken soup    The four calling birds were a big mistake  For their language was obscene  The five golden rings were completely fake   and turned my fingers green.    The sixth day after Christmas  The six laying geese wouldn't lay  So I sent the whole darn gaggle to the A.S.P.C.A.    On the seventh day, what a mess I found  The seven swans-a-swimming all had drowned   The eighth day after Christmas  Before they could suspect  I bundled up the  Eight maids-a-milking  Nine ladies dancing  Ten lords-a-leaping  Eleven pipers piping  Twelve drummers drumming - well, actually I kept one of the ladies... And sent them back collect    I wrote my true love  "We are through, love!"  And I said in so many words  "Furthermore your Christmas gifts were for the  (Soprano part only) Birds!"    (Everyone else in the original tune) Four calling birds,   Three french hens,  Two turtle doves  And a partridge in a pear tree. -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Isn't that funny? We were all laughing hysterically. Anyway, let me know what you have to say. I have to shut up now so I can leave. Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
