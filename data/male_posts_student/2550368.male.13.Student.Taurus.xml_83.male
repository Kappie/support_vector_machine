Screw you =IJ= well its ok because we won 13-0 :)  Today we had to type of 5 prg's in english (well 3 was min).. I only had 3 written so I typed thoes by the time most people had one done then I wrote two real quick and finished before anyone. WTF!?! WHY DO YOU ALL TYPE SO SLOW!?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?? eh.  I just got back from a long choir concert where I had my solo for fame.. Yes I kicked ass (or so everyone sais) so woohoo!  Off to bed we go, Jeff
