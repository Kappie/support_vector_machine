    
       Beneath the sky, life deceased, life was born. Above the skies, life soared, We conquered.  Changing, evolving; We've conquered life, and life has conquered us.  We change, we adapt, all but improve.  Amidst our new found peace, human weaknesses stagger; Slow but not far behind.  We have undoubtedly changed, we have become unrecognisable to our past; But at the slightest tempts, the minute of provocations, we burst, we come out forth. To our old ways that we fear, that we've suppressed all these years.  Ravaging, pillaging. Lusting, and with obsession.  Yes we've changed, but some things just never change.
