When I get out of the shower, my sister prompts me, telling me that we are going to go somewhere and that I am going to be the driver. (You must understand, I am a relative "late bloomer" when it comes to driving). So this will be the second time for me on the freeway. I assume we are going to take HWY 78 to San Marcos and the Fry's there, but my problem lies in the word "assume." Once we are in the car (Nissan, Sentra, standard), he gives me directions to his favorite gas station on Felicita. This catches my attention (Ã´_o):  why go out of the way?  I think to myself, only to realize we are heading down the 15 towards the downtown San Diego Fry's. Ahhh!! Thankfully, didn't run into many problems (just a side note: we left at about 11:30 AM). So we drive back to a parking lot in Escondido eventually, and set up some cones so's I can learn me how 'ta parallel parks. After several hours of stepping on the shift, stepping on the gas, stepping on the brakes, shifting gears, we head home. It's 4:30 PM (Xb). I don't know what else to do now; so I think I'll either stay on the computer for a while, then exercise and/or eat, then stay up until I crash on my bed. hahaha. okay. I'm done.
