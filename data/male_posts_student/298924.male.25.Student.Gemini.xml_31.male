My boy  urlLink Barry Bonds   has broken Mark McGwire's 3 year old single season home run record and I couldn't be happier....Barry is my kind of dude....he does his job and doesn't too much care about anything else but doing the best he can do....I really wish he could win a title....I predicted that he would do well in the school paper earlier this year so count me among those who aren't surprised at all....  Oh will post tomorrow about the weekend in football...peace!
