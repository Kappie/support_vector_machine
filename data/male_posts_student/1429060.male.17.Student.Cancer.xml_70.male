I shall have a lot of "there was nothing today". Evil  Age of Innocence  essay test is tomorrow too. I shall die. Utterly.  Doom doom doom more doom and the preacher spews a bit more doom about man's walk over the pit of hell. Would you like some death with that? No! Doom, damnit! Doom doom doom!  I sincerely apologize for the frantic and evidently insane post.
