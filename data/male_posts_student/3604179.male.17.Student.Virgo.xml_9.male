Yes, that's right we had to play with 9 fielders instead of 10. HAHAHAHAHA, and to make things better, I played 2nd base!!!! HAHAHAHA, and my dad put our really 2nd baseman in the outfield. Well, you think it's over don't you. Nope, to cap things off, we were facing a team that has not lost! Yea, put that together and you have what happend, a 25-0 4 inning shutout. OUCH! I went 0-1. I made some plays at 2nd base, but our regular 2nd baseman wasn't exactly an outfielder... He dropped 3 very catchable balls. Oh well though, it's not like it mattered. we're 1-6 now. I'm just hoping next week we can win for once. After Monday though, my life became awesome. No, I didn't get a girl or anything. Just got to see Spider-man 2 at the opening show at cedar creek, 12am on wednesday. Fun stuff. I get to go boating tommorow. My dad's wealthy friend with his chevy surburban with dvd/game system players mounted into the seats for his kids, and the bose speakers came to town. (Very high up guy!) His boat is getting XM satellite radio put into it tommorow. Wow, I wish I had that kind of money, don't we all! Oh well I will just enjoy it while they are here, and hope I become as successful as him. I'm glad to be writing again, pray i get some lovin' this summer, Somethin' has to come up, I am feeling lonely. Oh well, 4th of july coming up, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS! I have my ammo all stowed away. My brother's friends dad is out of his house, and it's time for some explosives. Great show. Next wednesday i get to go to the Cubs Vs. Brewers. I am a huge BREWER fan, and I am hoping they destroy the cubs, but it will be fun either way. The brewers are in 3rd place as of Today(.5 games out of the wild card) YEA BABY. 5 game winning streak, it's a great feeling to see a team that has barely had 60 wins last season almost get to that mark by the all star break. 41-34, I'll take that anytime from the brewers who have went to the WS once! WOW, what a team. Let's just hope this is going to stay for awhile. cya lata everyone, ttyl. SAVE ME SOMEONE! J (Hopefully I can grow some bigger balls sometime this summer)
