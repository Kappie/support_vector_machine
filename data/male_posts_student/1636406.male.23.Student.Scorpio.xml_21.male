But the Internet boom happened, and games were a casualty. The Industry started to receive attention, reports circulated on the profitability of games,  urlLink Mario 64  selling in excess of 10 million cartridges- pulling in way more than any hollywood blockbuster.  In fact the Video Game industry was everything the movie industry wanted to be: consoles changed every 3-5 years, there were competing standards that many families welcomed, and of course there were rumors of price fixing by the bigger companies like  urlLink Sony  and  urlLink Nintendo --the DVD business model was ripped right from the Video Game industry. The cow that broke the camel's back was  urlLink Microsoft  getting into the biz- first by working with  urlLink Sega  on their  urlLink Dreamcast , and eventually by releasing their  urlLink Xbox.  The mentality for any market it seems is- if it's good enough for  urlLink Bill Gates,  it's good enough for me to invest in.   When Sony entered the market in  urlLink 1994  things changed-- the old rules didn't quite fit there was heavy competition, and since then it has been maturing at a growing pace. Everyday there are more poor quality games hitting the market and many more movie tie-ins (which ultimately are not as bad as their forefathers see  urlLink ET ).  Nintendo reigned supreme since the '70's but was ousted by Sony. Nintendo survived by taking the stance they didn't care if they were number #1, they just planned to always turn a profit.  The strategy has paid off- Nintendo products may not be on the bleeding edge, but they always make a nice profit- unlike Microsoft who has lost a  urlLink fortune  over their Xbox.  So... Needless to say, seeing an industry grow up before my eyes was fun, I just had lost interest...  Until E3 of this year. The games coming from Nintendo  urlLink look great.   urlLink Zelda,   urlLink Metroid,   urlLink Mario,   urlLink Starfox  and most of all the  urlLink Nintendo DS  have really sparked my interests again-- the games are starting to get better, they do look good but may end up being total duds like most of the games i've played recently. (I'm keeping my fingers crossed).  I will buy these games, and a  urlLink Nintendo DS -- and I will probably love them. Sony now has its very own handheld called the  urlLink PSP - but I sneaking suspicion it will be overpriced and will not be worth the money.  I have a PS2, and I have to admit it isn't half as much fun as my GameCube.  So Kudos go to  urlLink Nintendo - you've survived  urlLink 115 years  and I suspect you'll be around for at least 115 more.
