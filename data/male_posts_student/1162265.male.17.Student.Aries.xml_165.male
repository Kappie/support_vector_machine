Say 'I'm proud to live with niggers!' Say 'I'm proud to stand on the value with a rag on my head and make the property values drop down.' Say 'I'm proud to drink malt liquor and smoke weed!'" etc.  He went on like that for a few more minutes and I was seriously cracking up, but this was like 11:30 or 12 at night so I was waking my parents up.... Just talking online and that came to my mind.  Thought it should be written down, because I looooove to write every random thought down.  Thoughts have value, you know?
