No doubt this blog will soon disappear into internet oblivion once I realise it will just be me reading it but I need something to entertain me over the long summer months. You never know, I might even post some of my poems on here if you are lucky enough! A quick congrats to Simon for his great update of the Blue Coat wikipedia page which is just getting better and better although is still unfortunately missing and article on legends such as Mr Ranguala (sp?) and Mr Armishaw (pictured below, right- next to a Gillingham shirt)   He has let himself go a bit by the looks of it!
