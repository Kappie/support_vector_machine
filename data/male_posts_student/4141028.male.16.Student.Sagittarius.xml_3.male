I'm glad that I can finally take my mind off of a few things that have been bothering me. I'm not one to put all my emotions on the web for anyone to read but let's just say it's been eating me away for awhile. So next time you get down or restless...just transfer schools where technologically inclined people are needed! Easy as that!  Sincerely Happy
