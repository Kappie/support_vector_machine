I know, it is not at all what my profile says I would do, but it has given me a new motto besides "destroyer of the Halo." I am now James Lucas, "Toujours Pur." If anyone knows what that means, I congratulate them on their knowledge of basic French. I just finished my first year of French a couple of weeks ago, and I can barely say anything, but I can read a lot of it. Anyway, I finally got around to reading the fifth Harry Potter book, and I know I'm a little behind, but I've had a lot of stuff to do lately, so I havent had time to do simple things like reading, or research for D Fortunately, a new influence has given me some new inovations for the big quest coming up. To anyone interested, I have created a new enchantment system, and the ability to create spells based on your current spell knowledge, and also one can now buy spells from other people. If I work it out right, I can also reduce or completely remove the Spell Level system for a more RPG-like MP system. Of course, to balance things, each spell will have to have a percent-failure chance.... wow... I haven't gotten to talk about anything like that for awhile, and I guess I got carried away. I think that's all I got ta say today, and if it's not, I'll post more later. Oh yeah! I almost forgot! Since it is June, I'll be putting up a countdown to my birthday. 21 more days!
