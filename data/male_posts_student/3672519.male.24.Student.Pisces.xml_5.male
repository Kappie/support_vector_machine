After one week, only five of my archer fish remain, despite my best efforts to make them shoot jets of water at dangling crickets. The pearl arowana which cost me 35 friggin bucks was possessed of so much proud vitalityhe decided tofling himself onto dry land.   And not a single bloody koi is dead, the cowards. Looks likeI'm really out of touch. Oh well. This should bethe last entry of the month, and before I know it,August will creepup like a thief.   Just returned home from NUSSSuntec, where I spent the evening having dinner and drinks (4 bucks for a mixer!) on the terrace with some friends.We were sitting overlooking the city-scape when it started to rain, shrouding the buildings and stirring up a cool wind. It always putsyou in a certain mood, and times like this I feelthat its wonderful tobe alive, and even more so to be able to afford drinks on a rainy terrace high up in the heart of thenight-time city. Hah.Here's to the rest of the year.
