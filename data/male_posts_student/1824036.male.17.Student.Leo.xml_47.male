I wrote on 7/22/04:  "By all press reports, it appears Brock Lesnar's chances of signing with an NFL franchise is slim...[much snippage]....) Barring some desparate team like the Lions looking for a quick ticket draw (ala aged Joe Montana going to the Cheifs in '94), it looks like Brock will have to return to the business that he had already earned 10 Million dollars from."  Whodathunk?  Brock got himself a contract with the team he wanted to play for in the first place:  The Minnesota Vikings.    Granted, he still has to make it through Training Camp and the pre-season before he "makes the team."  But by all media accounts, Brock just might have what it takes to be a bonafide NFL defensive tackle.  I'm rooting for him.
