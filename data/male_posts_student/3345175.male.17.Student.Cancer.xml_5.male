Key people include the following: me down the front looking like an arse with that pen;  The girl with the very red nose (due to the bodypaint) and the burgundy tee would be Moira, hugging Grace ("oooh FUCK ME!").  Chris is the larger guy with the blue striped tee, standing next to Maz (yes, MAZ!) with the shorter hair and the mysteriously voluptous bosom.  Behind her is Kyle (or Kylie, as we liked to kno she/he) with the red vest on. Very hot in real life, until the yellow bodypaint and costume he had to wear made him look like a drag queen with Jaundice. A disturbingly HOT drag queen with jaundice.  Behind my lil Mazly Wazly (altho "lil" prob aint the right way to describe that pic of her) is Gareth, whose face u can only see a lil of.  The cluster in the middle involve lil Ashleigh (my female son) just above Gracey, with Erika (stripey sleeves) and Jenni on either side of her (i love Jenni. LOVE Jenni!). Behind them are the lovely Karen and the very red Leanne, and behind them, Steph (who sooo kicks ass) and Ross (my ex). At the far right with big cheesy grin is my little Lucy with "duracell bunny" Lori next to her.  Wow ive bored the hell out of you.  The dude on the far left is Keith, our musical director, and behind Kyle's hair you can just see a wee bit of a woman's face - thats Julie Austin (who is like my totally role-modelest role-model), our director. I love her. She rocks, and we get along scarily well for someone who was in braveheart.   This is us in the Citz Theatre Glasgow (where me, Jenni, Lucy, Leanne, Gareth, Ash and Steph will be appearing again late this July) during SYT last year.  *sigh* good times.    Heehee i cant get over how much of an arse i look there. ARSE-ME!
