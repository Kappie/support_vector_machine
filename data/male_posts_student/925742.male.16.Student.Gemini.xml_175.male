So I give it a few swings and it seems fine.  Suddenly, someone is with me and we both need to kill these goblins.  But they're the Everquest goblins.... yeah.    So as we're cleaving through the masses of goblins that wave their hands at us to attack, we realize there are more in the floors below us.  Which kinda reminds me of Zero Tolerance for the Sega Genesis.  Suddenly, as I'm screaming obscenities like the Colony Marines from Aliens (which I saw last night), a sword appears to my left... shiny and white/gray.  It has a guard like a sai (meant to catch other swords), a convenient hand guard, and what looks like a chain of some sort connecting it to another sword.  So I think to myself... SHIT YES, SWORD CHUCKS (a la Fighter from 8bit theater, which I read too much)!   Now I'm cleaving through goblins with ease and I look at the carnage I am sewing.  Blood and guts everywhere, like Bishop from Aliens.... I have the urge to vomit, but am told to move on.  Then, as we go through an elevator, I can't find my swords!  So I'm telling my partner I need them and I can't go with out my swords.  Well, the dream gets vague and I can't recall the other parts here.
