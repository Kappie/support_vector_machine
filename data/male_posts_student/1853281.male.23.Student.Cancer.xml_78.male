Talked to a proff today about my big paper...got a ton of more sources and it is embarrasing to share just how excited i got from some new places to find journal articles she showed me...i am such a geek. back on the pain-a-lates bandwagon after a weeks hiatus...ouch...and damn....i am so weak, it feels like i am starting over. Thanks, J. for making me finish last night:) Okay, so i swore off this whole internet dating thing, stopped e-mailing people whose profiles i found interesting, and lo and behold someone e-mailed me...having fun with this correspondance.He at least is not the type of person who writes a two line e-mail...so that is fun. been really feeling my vices recently...though have not been indulging them as relentlessly as before, so that is good. started a new story on sunday, i like it, even though i think it might be a tear jerker for some folks as it is rather pathetically sad just now. But don't worry, i have the feeling everything will turn out just right in the end. anyways, off to take a midterm,  cheers d
