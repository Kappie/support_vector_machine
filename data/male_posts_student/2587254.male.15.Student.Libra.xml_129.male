Plus I've been on a trend of 2 hour naps...which is really cool ^_^. Blasted Flames lost tonight, which makes the series tied 1-1 now which kinda sucks. Hmm rest of my day went something like this..of course much more detailed:  -Music: learning minor scales though I already know them like a Chinese Restaurant owner knows Dim Sum -Science: Bio Test. I think I did alright -Lunch: Mmm Jasper's ice cappuchino rules =). -Bio: Got tests back. 75% on all of them....and 57% on bellringer. Lucky they worth almost nothing. -English: Finished in-class assignment, Kurtis still had his football gag going. Monologues due soon.  Ugh pray for me people....I'm actually working for once. End of grade 10....well I can't relaly slack off I've come to realize. Bummer if gr. 11 and 12 is like this...ugh.  Oh yeah also Arjun and Shaunvir said something about London Youth Symphony Orchestra...think I might join up. Argh also gotta practice Niki's and Kelsey's accompaniments...solos in a week or something =S.  Well I'm out for the night....just finished history essay and I'm really tired. Thank goodness I got LCD....my eyes would be burnt by now.  Later.
