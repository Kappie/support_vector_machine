Aside from spending entire days in my pajamas, nay,  weeks , the culinary arts remain a strange and forbidden realm that should only be traversed with step-by-step instructions.  However, a late-night expedition in to the "kitchen" (or area where food is supposedly stored and prepared for consumption) I happened upon a marvel exquisite in it's simplicity, and insidious in it's conception. Here's what you'll need:  01. Salted soda crackers 02. Margarine 03. Medium cheddar cheese 04. Tabasco sauce 05. Oh, and a knife or "cutting and spreading" instrument of some sort.  Put some margarine on one side of the cracker, generously cover surface with Tabasco sauce (the margarine prevents the Tabasco from seeping in to the cracker and making it mushy), and,  BAM!  top with a slice of cheese.
