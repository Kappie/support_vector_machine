You might get closer to see who it was, and when you got closer you would see that this man is not just any man, it is the most wanted man in the world, it is Usama Bin Ladin.  You might also notice that the “evil one” is just a man, albeit a tall man, but just a man nonetheless. Aside from the fact that Bin Ladin’s radical politics have spread fear and death wherever they permeate, Bin Ladin has been able to affect the world in other ways as well.  Without Bin Ladin, our country would never have invaded Iraq, despite the fact that Hussein and Bin Ladin never spoke.  The Administration would have not been able to use the fear that Bin Ladin has created to its advantage.  Bin Ladin, who is just a man, has been transformed into a monolithic, almost supernatural boogey man, who eludes our capture and continues his evil plotting.  For the sake of the families affected by Bin Ladin’s violence he desperately needs to be brought to justice, and for the sake of our imagination he needs to be brought to justice.  The longer he eludes us the longer people will think he is everywhere and nowhere all at once.  Bin Ladin’s image has caused the people of America, Spain, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Somalia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, the Philippines, Indonesia and other countries too much grief, and his image has allowed our own President to create a supernatural identity of his own.  You and I live in a world where we always want to appear more than what we are, some of us are better at it than others, some have even reached a super-status of immortal, but Bush and Bin Ladin are just men, that’s it.
