The Hill reports the defections have Democrats in the Senate in a tizzy, trying to re-assure Jewish donors that they're more pro-Israel than they act.   Though Jews comprise little more than 2 percent of Americans, they are concentrated in areas such as Florida and Ohio, which are battleground states.   Before Mc-Cain-Feingold, the mother of all campaign legislation fiascoes, as much as 70 percent of the Democratic Party's donations came from Jewish contributors.   Since the 2000 election - and Sept. 11 - Jewish support for Republicans has been climbing.   And Sen. John Kerry has not done his party any favors with antagonistic remarks about Israel's security fence protecting it from West Bank suicide bombers.   Some significant defectors from the Democrats include: American Jewish Congress president Jack Rosen, a former big donor to the Democrats, has contributed $100,000 to Republicans since George W. Bush was inaugurated.   And California's Ronald and Dawn Arnall, who previously handed over nearly $1.5 million to Democrats, have surpassed Pioneers and Rangers by raising $1 million for W, besides plunking down $1 million of their own dough to the Republican National Committee.   "Democrats do not speak with a unified voice on Israel anymore," said Eric Cantor (R-Va.), the only Jewish Republican in the House of Representatives.   "The Democrats want to re-inject the United States in to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a neutral arbiter and neutral voice."
