Last week she found out that Cat has been upset with her. Seems our little Rebecca has been being a massive bitch to poor Catherine, unintentionally of course. Cat is very sensitive about her ears (God only knows why - the girl's a sex-goddess), and apparently Becca made some jokey comments about them. I have to agree she hasnt really been herself recently - she does seem slightly more arrogant, self-involved and uncareful when it comes to people's feelings. I doubt it's her own fault, but she worries me none-the-less.  And now she has decided it is good enough for her best-friend of three years, who helped her through so much and relied on her for so much, to just say "See ya", hop on the bus as per usual, and not even wave as she gazes out of the bus window as it crawls past. Not a phone call, no hugs or kisses, no nothing. Not like her.      urlLink    Here she is: Becky-Boo, a little too under-expectant of the zooming capabilities of my camera. Look how purdy she is. Awwww. And there's Kenneth's ear too!
