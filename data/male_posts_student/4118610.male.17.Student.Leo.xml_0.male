And since I am hiding in my bomb shelter with an AK47 and 3 years worth of supplies because of that new terror warning, the answer came easily: Terrorism! Thats right, the Telepathic Tree can help america in the field of national security! How it works is simple. Since it is telepathic, it can read minds. And since a terrorist thinks terrorist thoughts like "I hate america," "I hate jews" and "o my allah, that womans face is showing!", they should be easy to pick out. Of course, the Telepathic Tree isn't perfect, but I bet that woman was a bitch, so she had it coming anyways. urlLink
