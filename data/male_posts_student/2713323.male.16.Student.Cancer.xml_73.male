In the morning i had a leg injury, my ankle was messed up when i was walking to school, but still, i went for P.E! lol..when everyone was in chinese and malay. hahahah! shiok. Den after we had a few free periods, den chemo den another free period for me. Had interhouse after school today, i was reluctant to go, as i managed to escape from playing soccer under Topaz. Budden Danny said he needed players, and since i was doing nothing on that day, i could'nt say no. Yes, and i made a fool out of myself on the pitch. Hmm...i didnt play soccer for such a long time, i've lost my touch. I played 3 matches outta 4. In total i made 3 dribbles, 1 assist to goal, one goal attempt which was saved by the keeper unfortunatley, and around 10-20 passes and clearances, yeah, throughout the 2nd and 3rd match, my ankle was hurting like crazy, but i continued playing. When Yg and Mitch asked me why i took off right boot, i just told them it was too tight. Hehe, im looking at it now, and its swollen, it'll be ok soon i hope, :P. The purple house, which was the one i was playing for, lost all 4 matches, lol we were the lousiest. Sapphire won 3 and drawed one, head to head with house Topaz which had the same scores. The rest all no hope ba. Hahaha, i really did badly in soccer today, so i hope if there is badminton, i can reclaim my honour. Kekeke. So tiring...i didnt bring my hp to school, so when i was sitting at the bus stop i though, hey maybe i should borrows someone's phone to get my dad to pick me up..den i saw roy, he was smoking...den i asked him, "hey, did you bring your phone? can lend me make a phone call?" den he searched his pockets, and he didnt find him, den he panicked lol..den he threw his bag down and got me to hold his cigarette. I was like abit scared, cos later ppl tot i smoking, somemore im in sch u and hes not. So i hid the cigarette haha...den he ransacked his bag...couldnt find it, so he ran back to school and ran back out. Like a mouse likedat. In the end, it was in his bag all along. The best part was, it had no batt. So i had to walk all the way home. Shit. Nvm, i don't need to go school at 7 tml, reach around 10.30 - 11. hehehe! \m/
