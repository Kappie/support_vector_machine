Have a hell-lava time at VolcanoLand, Asia’s largest man made volcano where visitors will embark on an adventure journey to discover a mysterious lost city of the Mayan and explore the depths of the volcano.   Highlights of the attraction include a subterranean journey to the ‘earth’s core’. You will uncover an Archaeological Dig, stumble through a Creepy Corridor and discover the Expedition Headquarter of Professor Hugo where he will reveal his last message.   You will take the Professor’s lead to ‘descend’ into the bowels of the earth in a ‘pit cage’, venture across subterranean waterfalls, ancient fossils and pre-historic bones, sparkling minerals and crystals formations and then cross a rickety rope bridge to reach a timeless world where you will experience a multi-sensory show on the story of the universe and close encounter with the King of Fire and culminating in a volcanic eruption!  taken from:  (http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_volcanoland.htm)
