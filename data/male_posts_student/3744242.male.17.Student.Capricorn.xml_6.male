First off, having seven kids all on your back at the same time is just not fun, no matter what anyone tells you. Now, when you mix water and a football in with that, the results just aren't pretty. I think I got hit in the nose about four times and the eye about seven times, the stomach five times, the balls countless times, but those may not be the right numbers because I might have been unconscience at one time or another. I think the worst part of it was that one of the little brats...camper (damn, I did it again) had the never to say that I should be stronger like the life guards becuase they can catch the ball. Little did he know that the life guards didn't have any kiids hanging off of them while I had about...SEVEN ON MY BACK!...sorry, I needed to get that out.  To continue on witht he string of beatings, at karate I got beat up more than usual. Now, karate is all about beating people up...well, a little more than that, but you get the general idea...but I gotan extra beating today. Its all becuase some shmuck has some pent up agression and doesn't like to listen to the rules very well. The rules were to make three hand attacks then back off. Only three attacks...then back off. Last time I checked sixteen wasn't the same as three, but that's how many times he came in and attacked me, in my face adding to yet even more facial injuries that are going to show up tomorrow.  Well, I'm cutting this short so I can go nurse my wounds, so leave me alone!  Out
