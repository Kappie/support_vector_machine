Leave it to Fuji Television Network to bring the venerable custom into the modern world of movies. Its first seven-day Movie King event runs from Aug. 21 in the wide-open area of Odaiba along Tokyo's waterfront, which houses Fuji TV's headquarters. The fest is an extravaganza to consolidate Fuji TV's already strong status as Japan's foremost movie-oriented network. Highlights include special-edition screenings of "Star Wars," "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." Lucasfilm has granted exclusive approval for the screenings, the first since their theatrical release here in 1997. A preview of "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" with an appearance by star Milla Jovovich ( urlLink news ) plus a Stephen Chow Night featuring "Shaolin Soccer" and the popular Hong Kong thesp himself complement screenings of Fuji TV-produced pics to be released later this year. Among those are Shinji Aoyama's psycho-thriller "Lakeside Murder Case," and "Swing Girls" by Shinobu Yaguchi ("Waterboys") about an all-girl high school big band, both favorites among this fall's releases. Odaiba houses one of Tokyo's most modern multiplexes, the Mediage Cinema, host to most of the showings. To top it off, all 24 parts of season three of TV skein "24" will be screened back-to-back, with only one brief intermission. This calls for some sake afterwards. "It's all about fun and about building up our brand," explains Chihiro Kameyama, head of Fuji TV's motion picture department and chief organizer of Movie King. Although not an official film festival, the event could establish itself as Tokyo's prime audience-oriented film event of the year. Given the continuing struggle of the Tokyo Intl. Film Festival for relevance and public acceptance, the competition from across town could become stronger than wished for. "It's an interesting concept, and Fuji TV has the power to pull in the crowds," observes a film distribution exec. Being part of the all-summer Adventure King festival and amusement park staged annually by Fuji TV also helps. Last year's installment of this assortment of Fuji TV content-based attractions chalked up 3.5 million visitors over less than two months.
