We talked alot: families, college, job, my stuff, her stuff. WE've met alot at the ice-cream store, and we  agreed  to go there anytime fot eating some.  I watched to 2 episodes of " SEX IN THE CITY ", that was just  GREAT !!!!!Samantha remuved her cancer( brest cancer), Miranda went for "her" honey moon ( she hates these romantic sutff), Carye tol Alek she wants to have a baby cause she's getting old but he said he doesn't want babies and Char.. well.. she showed the babiyes stuff to Carye! I guess i'll die when it ends, in august! Thank nice Lord there are the DVDs and when they arrive here and when i get the money i'l buy all!  I finished the book i was reading "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson, the book is not wanderful but it's teachful. It's about a treasure lost in an island, sometimes i thought I was watching to "Pireates of Carebian"; 'Sometimes I wake up at night. I can hear the sea around Treasure Island. I can hear the voice of Long John Silver's parrot calling - "Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight" ' Who said it was Jim, the boy who becomes the hero and narrator of the story.
