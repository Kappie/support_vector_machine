I would attempt to come up with an excuse for not blogging but then I do have the intelligence of a Northweigen Bowling Alley so I s'pose I'll just have to grovel for forgiveness from Steph! Anyways, there is a slight excuse for mine absense from this world that is "Blog", I've been at a Summer School in Keele Unmi for a week.. well actually it was only 5 days but the amount of activity in that time made it feel like a bloody month! As all of you know I am a complete sadistic moron who loves to learn and as such I was most perturbed when I discovered the majority of the Summer Camp involved sport! Ergh! Sport! Us camp people don't do sport!! However, there was one thing which *could* have been worse than the general sport - Army training. Fortunately, though, I had by this time made a lot of new friends (I'm still upset Chad didn't wanna get any closer to me :P! lol, you know i love you steph!) so we had quite a bit of fun during those three hours, even if they DID get mood ALL over my clothes! tsk! On top of the grueling sport timetable we had a packed night-life planned including; discos(the best one was the best... cept for the fact everybody kept on slappin' my ass!), Irish Dancin' (that was a brilliant night.. well, cept for all the smoke in the air, I'm prettty sure the Warranty on my respiratory system is void now :(...), Glo' Bowling (Unfortunately I missed that cus of a migraine... which was a right shame!)  and a formal meal (formal my ass!)... However, we did get 7 lectures! YAY! lol, these were in: Chemistry, Law, Politics, English, Visual Arts, and sumthing else... yep, I was paying attention.. lol..  Anyway, that enough on Keele, I've still gotta admit that Oxford was a better Establishment, but there were much better people at Keele than Oxford! Today's been quite an eventful day, went car shopping (Our car MUST have mechanised Cup holders... MUST...), discovered that it costs damn Â£65 for the Student Bus Pass (thats a REAL saving! NOT!) and then attempted to buy a lead to connect our new Video Camera to my computer but that went to pot when I discovered I haven't got any fire-wire ports - Gerald didn't half give me a crap computer!!! Some other stuff happened of not today, but that's for private ears :P... there was one  very good thing about today - i got to see Steph! yay!  Anyways... I better finish this of now cus I'm being called for dinner in a mo... Have fun ye' All, Martin J.  PS: We're not going to have a compitetion now on how many blogs we can psot are we hunni???
