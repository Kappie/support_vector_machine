Man, come on, Slick Willie is the man who was classless, sold nuclear secrets to China, rented out the Lincoln bedroom for his "rich" contributers, and dirtied the name of the Presidency. Clinton has about zero respect for anyone that doesn't have a last name of Clinton. Just look at him and Hillary snoozing through Reagan's funeral. If I was in Bush's position, the last thing I would do is to kiss CLinton's ego in front of the world, after his harsh (and deservedly so) remarks on Bill Clinton in 2000. Comeon, most conservatives believe Clinton should be sitting in a jail cell right now! One day, George Bush has to learn that if he plays nice, the left wing media and elite will still bash him.
