The ride down was boring but once we got there I started to flip out. I was like are you ready? We're in the same place as Simple Plan want a listerine strip? It was insane I mean wow! The lines were long but we went around to the back and got in a lot earlier than everyone else did. they separated boys from girls for the pat down search and the guy that patted me down was really hot so I told him that and that it wasn't a very good pat down and I demand another one, he just smiled and laughed. Then once we got in there we headed straight to the Simple Plan booth and met Patrick :D he was so cute! He was pretty funny too! I bought a Simple Plan cuff and then went on to the Army of Freshmen booth as I promised Emma. I asked Chris about her and he's like yeah I remember her! She rocked! And they told me to say hi to her for them. So after that we wandered around the booths and Katie bought a Sugarcult shirt and Courtney bought some patches and guitar picks from them. So after that we ended up back at the Brian stage (where Simple Plan was playing later that day) and we saw David from Simple Plan and we found out what tour bus was theirs and we waited there looking for the members and finally Pierre came out :D! I screamed Simple Plan rocks and we love you Pierre! He was like at the other end of the little fenced in area behind the stage and he looked at me and gave me the rock on sign! Then he walked by the fence and I'm screaming come on Pierre come here! But he had other things to do so he didn't. Then Sebastian walked right by us and we didn't even notice! I was so mad we didn't notice! Then after about another hour it was about 15 minutes before Simple Plan was going on stage and Chuck walked out and we were like come here Chuck you gotta come here! He said no I can't I have to warm up and did a drumming movement, he was so cute in person! So then we went over and got close to the pit and when they came on I was screaming sooooo loud I was screaming at the top of my lungs and they started to play and Pierre goes "Everybody jump, jump!" so we all started to jump like no one there wasn't jumping. Then Pierre was like you know we could only pick a few tour dates this summer because we are behind on the new CD but we said we ARE going to Chicago because they love our energy and always get hyped up with us! So they kept playing and when they would let us sing everyone in that crowd was screaming the lyrics and it sounded louder than they did, you could see the amazement on their faces it was amazing! Then after their show was over they were over at their booth and I bought a shirt that I'll have to take a picture of and got in line along with Courtney and Katie we waited for like 4 hours in line but then they left so we were bummed! But we met this cool girl in line and she was going to see them in three more days so she said she'll get autographs and send them to us so that rocked. So then we went and sat down at the Volcom stage and had some dinner then headed back towards the Brian stage since Sugarcult was playing in a few hours. We stopped back at the Simple Plan booth and Jeff was there so we got autographs from him then headed back to the stage and layed down next to the fence by the gate. David was there when we got there so we got his autograph and I asked him for a hug and he said sure and gave me a hug! Courtney is like NATE HUG ME! So I did, I almost cried when I hugged him! Then he had to leave so we sat back down and like a half hour later I see Chuck walking up and I shot up like I had a rocket in my but and screamed it's Chuck! Everyone was like huh? Then when they seen him they all jumped up too and he gave me a hug and autograph and then he left and he came back like two times. So the second time I talked to him and then the third we were talking to Melissa on Courtney's cell and I asked her if she wanted to talk to him, she said yeah so then we went up there and I said Chuck can you talk to my friend Melissa for me? He like was really busy and said yeah sure and dropped everything and talked to her! He's like "Hey Melissa I just called to see what's up, (pause) well I gotta go I got things to do!" then he gave me the phone back so then I'm like do you know who that was? She didn't know so I said the drummer, Chuck, from Simple Plan and she just started to scream! Oh yeah before Chuck Pierre came up to the fence and I was like five feet from him then he had to go so I didn't get a hug or autograph so that sucked! Let me tell you, Chuck WOW he is AMAZING! He was SUPER SUPER SUPER SUPER cute in person and was REALLY NICE! I was in a haze! Anyway when Sugarcult played it was the last show of the night so everyone was there jumping and moshing and singing. It was amazing Pierre was up there on stage and I kept looking at him and stuff it was cool! So everyone was jumping at one time then some girls said send me up! So I picked them up with like no trouble even though I'm weak and sent them up. It was cool then after it was over I could barely talk my voice was out and it was over so we went home. But at Hardee's there was alot of fellow Warped Tour goers and we talked to one of them it rocked! Well that's the most amazing day of my life! I got hugs from them! WOW! *Screams*
