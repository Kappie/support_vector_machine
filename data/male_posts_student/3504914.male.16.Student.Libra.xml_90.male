More importantly, however, they look up to Sean Connery AS James Bond as an idol. Now bona fide men (not the sherry sipping, cane twirling, metrosexuals women call men these days, take  urlLink Gackt  for example) rejoiced when they heard Pierce Brosnan was finally giving up the seat of glory. Then they hit themselves in their genitals, because it was yet another blow to manhood, when it was announced that Eric Bana was the most likely candidate to be the new James Bond. I mean honestly, it’s not that he isn’t a decent actor, he’s just not Bond.  So, without further ado, I bring to you the candidates for the new James Bond. -----    Candidate Number 1:  Sean Connery    What? Did I just make a blunder? FUCK NO, DAMMO BLUNDERS NOT. After talking with a friend of mine I decided that the most fitting substitute for Sean Connery would be Sean Connery. And yes, I know he’s not getting any younger, but that could be the new Bond edge we’re looking for! Picture this…  ----- The wheels sped down the road; Bond was being chased yet again.  In that thick sexy accent of his, he said “I crapped me pants, AI!”  He put his hands to the brakes, and the vehicle came to a sliding halt. Slowly, Bond reached into his super chic jacket, and removed his latest Q invention.  The inhaler.  “Breathe in Booond, Breate out Boooond” The spy told himself.  He slowly removed himself from his Aston Martin wheelchair, and turned to face his pursuer.  “Ach, ye have a fine set of wheels, ye do!”  The woman got out, yer breasts reaching her toes as she did. Her Italian accent was cracked. “Ferrari…” She hobbled over to the man with the golden gun. “Should we go for a martini? Shakeeeeen, not stiiiiirrrrrred?”  Before Bond could say “AYE!” a voice from his jacket, that of Q, said “Remember Bond, no more martinis.” Before Bond could ask, Q’s voice came back. “And remember, if you’re going to have sex with her, you must, and I stress MUST, take your medication five hours before the Viagra. Q out.”  -----       Alright, so that would only appeal to people with Old People Fetishes, but it’s the best I could think of without the use of a time machine. And the best I can do at 12 at night. -----    Candidate Number 2: Bruce Willis    Now, I know what you’re thinking, he’s not English, he’s American. But DAMN, there are few men who can be the tough guy and still be charming. Ever seen Hudson Hawk? Fabulous movie, despite bombing in the box office, but then again, LOTR did well in the box office. So I don’t have very much trust for “the system”. ANYWAY, if you gave Bruce Willis an English accent, and put him in a suit, he’d be perfect for the part. Sure he’s getting old, but he’s still not THAT old.  -----    Candidate Number 3: Steve Irwin     No, sorry, I just couldn’t help myself xD But the stupidity in selecting ol Irwin is just as high as selecting Bana boy. They’re both prisoners of Mother England.  -----    Candidate Number 4: Bruce Campbell    Bruce Campbell would be an amazing choice if it wasn’t for the fact that he’s generally a B-rated actor, with the exception of his work in Army of Darkness. He’s one of the few people men will admit was The Man at some point or the other. As opposed to Sean Connery who still is. -----    Candidate Number 5: Dammo    That says it all really.    -----  Feel free to vote. And remember this classic moment from Monty Python’s  Life of Brian .   Brian: You are all individuals! Crowd: Yes!Yes, we are all individuals! Lone voice in crowd: I’m not Person next to him: Shh!   The moral of that situation? Err, vote me you cunts.    Link of the Moment  :  urlLink The Truth About George , the 43rd President of the USA. My favoured Bushisms  are    "And out of the evil done to America is going to come a more peaceful world, and a more better America..."   I mean honestly, what a tart xD    "What is your ambitions?"   Too not learn English and become president of the USA. I mean even Microsoft Word recognises that error.    "I'm honored to shake the hand of a brave Iraqi citizen who had his hand cut off by Saddam Hussein."   … Right, I don’t know what to make of this one.   "We want results in every single classroom so that one single child is left behind."   Ah well, want more, go to the aforementioned site.
