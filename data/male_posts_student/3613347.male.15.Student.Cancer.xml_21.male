Maybe i will.   Today no mahjong, no bball, no soccer, no nth. So sianz. Another day for me to think of how much hw i have that is uncompleted. When should i start? Dunno. Dun even feel like doing the IH Ace anymore.   My father went to bet on Euro 2004 Finals. I told him to buy Portugal, but he dunno English, so in the end bought Greece. Why??? I support Portugal since the start, and he go and buy their competitors. Never mind. If he wins, he will get 197 dollars-50= 147dollars in profit. Compared with the 90 dollars -50 dollars profit, its a better bet.   Sleep from 10-2, and then OLE OLE OLE OLE... OLE... OLE...   I rented Torque for my dear cousins. Cheaper By The Dozen and School Of Rock still rented out. Maybe i'll watch it later.   Buzz me if u want me to keep it for u. I have to burn it on my cd if u want.
