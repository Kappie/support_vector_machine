I had hoped Thomas would be getting a ride today, so I wouldn't have to worry about dividing my attention (or being selective) by walking home with Thomas and Kim who both live in the same general area.  It ended up Thomas didn't get a ride, but by that time, it was around 3:10, and I was convinced I'd wait for Kim.  So, I waited until 3:30ish, and Kim comes out from Mrs. Sommers, Thomas is still their of course pushing me along, trying to make me leave, now of course, weather makes me irritable, so I guess I sounded pretty rude towards Thomas.  After three blocks or so he just turned down the street, and walked the more direct way to his house.  I really felt bad after that, I've been divided over whether I should write it down, because I haven't felt so much regret in a very long time.  I don't even know if their is a resolution here, I'll think over break.  Maybe the Black History Breakfast tommorow will make me feel better.
