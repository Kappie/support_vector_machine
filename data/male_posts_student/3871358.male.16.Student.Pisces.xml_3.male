Read on, and those of you with a knowledge of politics and a weak constitution could do well to sit down.    " Americans allergic to the subtle Democratic flavor of Heinz ketchup can now plunge their "freedom fries" into a 100-percent guaranteed, patriotic alternative: "W Ketchup." "You don't support Democrats. Why should your ketchup?" says the W Ketchup Internet site wketchup.com, which promises a totally US-made condiment, right down to the bottle. Heinz ketchup is an institution on American dining tables. But the taste has soured a little for Republicans because Heinz empire heiress Teresa Heinz-Kerry is married to John Kerry (news - web sites), the Democrat hoping to unseat George W. Bush -- also known simply as "W" -- on November 2. "G5s (Gulfstream jets) or GIs? A Tough Choice," W. Ketchup tells prospective customers. "Choose Heinz and you're supporting Teresa and her husband's Gulfstream Jet, and liberal causes such as Kerry for President," it warns. Heinz has 57 varieties, but also 57 foreign factories, it claims. "W Ketchup comes in one flavor: American.""   As any of you who know me are sure to testify, this kind of thing irritates me to such a degree rarely seen outside of a mosquito jamboree. Auugghh, I hate with a passion right wing Americans. They should all get the chair in my opinion.   Thanks for reading                                     Stay Beatiful                                                         Davus
