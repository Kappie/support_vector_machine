So I thought he unplugged something. I reach behind to trace the wires back and I run into the power outlet that is sticking out of the wall.....what fallowed was pain and electrocution. Got a nasty burn and a bad headache but otherwise ok. Hey...it may even have helped quite the voices in my head :-P
