Barca are furious they have not received a penny in compensation and are demanding up to £3million for the centre-back, 17, who has agreed a five-year deal at Old Trafford. The Spaniards insist they are entitled to the sum as Pique has been at the club for seven years. And furious Barca president Joan Laporta revealed he had alerted FIFA about United’s handling of the affair. He claimed: “United have acted in a belligerent manner and failed to respect the effort some clubs make in bringing on young players.” Pique said: “Barca say I belong to them but I’m not a slave.” Staff reporter, The Sun  TOO BAD.
