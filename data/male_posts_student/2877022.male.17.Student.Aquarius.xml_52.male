I dun understand why u ppl arecommenting on janet's lovesickness in my last entry which apparently discusses the issue on the true meaning of Youth. Y-O-U-T-H.  Aniway, it's unavoidable that ppl fake or hide their true feelings. In whatever case, all of you, please have more faith. F-A-I-T-H. Believe that no matter what our frends are shunning away from you, it's all for your own good. even if you may be decieved by them, calm down and trust that it's a white lie.
