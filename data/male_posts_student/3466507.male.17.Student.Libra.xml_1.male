I'm going to work for a week at a firm which my mum's ex-sudent is a partner of. I might get paid, hopefully, i'm not sure.  After that, the remaining week will be spent at college practicing the musical presentation for the upcoming A-Level graduation. We (the admin group) are facing some problems but that is only natural. I hope we can overcome the problems and make our presentation a success. After that, we might make a presentation at a hotel some time around July for an international conference. Finally, we will reach our main aim, the public musical presentation. I won't talk too much about it yet, just that it's all oldies. There is still much work to be done. We'll get it rolling hopefully after the graduation presentation.
