I was quite pleased.  Sunday sunday sunday....Sunday I'm going to CHICAGO, to watch my favorite club team in the whole wide world play Timmy Howard and Manchester United. SO STOKED I am! Its gonna be tizite. I think we are going to go around downtown a little bit before we go to the game. It's being aired Tuesday at 12:00 noon on channel 55 Fox Sports Net Ohio. It will be on Fox Sports World live at 3:00 central time. CANT FUCKING WAIT YALL. Aint even funny how stoked I am.
