I agree with Megan, it is a person's own beliefs but religion is part of a person's beliefs.  My thoughts are that same sex marriages are morally wrong and they shouldn't be allowed.  But on the other hand, as Ryan Elliot said today, marriage is just another benefit for these people.  Not allowing it isn't going to do anything to the gay population.  They are still going to have the same relationships and everything.  I guess that it always will turn into a heated conversation because of so many different beliefs.  Anyway, that was just a thought I had after class. Keep it real!
