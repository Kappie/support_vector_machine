The Twins are just on a tear as of late, and if things keep going the way they have, we'll be leading the White Sox by about a hundred games come late September. They won last week even with the Mientkiewicz rumors floating around, which I'm sure weren't easy. Now that the fine folks of Boston are learning how to spell all over again, the Twins played very freely tonight. They looked like they were having fun and just dominated the Angels tonight. This team is very fun to watch right now.  Mad props to Silva on his complete game shut out, despite having about seven base runners per inning. Great defense, great pitching. Hopefully Lohse can shed his recent woes and pitch a quality game tomorrow.
