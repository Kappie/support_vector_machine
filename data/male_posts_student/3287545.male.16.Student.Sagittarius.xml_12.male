Here's what I wrote:   Dear Mum, 	There’s some stuff you need to know, which I feel I can’t say to you directly. I figured I’d write a letter to let you know.  This is going to be a shock, and I think you should make sure your sitting before reading on.  Last week, on Wednesday, me and Katie broke up. I didn’t tell you before because I knew you’d ask why and the reason is really complicated and hard for me to say. Ok, so here goes, I’m gay. I’ve known for quite a long time, and I recently ‘came out’ to my friends at school. I’m ok with it, they’re ok with it and I hope you will be to. I know you can be quite homophobic, but I hope in time you will grow to realise that I’m still the same person.  I don’t want Dad to know straight away, I’d rather I could talk to you first. I really hope you can still accept me and that you won’t make a big deal about it. I realise this will probably shock you and that it may take you some time to get used to the idea.  This is a really hard time for me and I could do with your support. I don’t expect you to accept homosexuality in general, I know you were brought up being taught that’s it’s wrong and all that. I can’t help it, it’s just how I am. I didn’t choose to be gay.  I know I never say it, but I do love you.  Jonathon.  x x x   When I got hoem from school, she was outside in the back garden. I went straight out and asked if she was ok. Richard and Tori cqame out ss well, so I couldn't really say anything, but once they went we briefly said a few things. She asked how long I'd known, and why I went out with Katie. I was just talking to her in her bedroom, and we had a more in depth discussion. I do feel better that she and pretty much everyone else knows. Today at school, was partly good, but also partly a nightmare. Everybody now knows about me being gay and I've just had people coming up to me constantly asking if it is true. In science Charlotte asked me, cause the other people in the class were to afraid to ask me themselves. I told her I was, and she said we could be friends and go shopping and stuff. She was really nice about it. She even said gay people are fucking fashionable. So, I've had people from me year group looking at me all day, and I have to say it's been kinda fun. All my friends have been really supportive and great about it. I stupidly told Lucy the other day I fancied Dean, cause now everyone seems to know that part as well, which is extreamly embarissing. I'll be seeing him tommorrow first lesson in Graphics, so I don't know what's going to happen there.
