Not too fancy.. but still cool.  Nevermind now.. I'm listening to something else.  What have I been doing.  Not much really.  Played some basketball today.  Beat Washington.  That was fun.  I played a lot with those guys in AAU stuff.  They were missing a lot of guys, but who cares.  What else is going on?  Right now I'm uploading some pictures for  urlLink SeeThesePhotos .  Pretty cool, I guess.  I'm glad I'm getting around to uploading.  I'm also going to start uploading my pictures to a different account so everyone can purchase my pictures.  A bit easier than deviantart... but I still love DA.  I don't get any comments on DA anymore.  I'm clueless as to why.  I think my stuff's decent.  Maybe people think differently.  I guess I kind of forgot about my plan to redesign my page.  I'm guessing I'll never get to that soon.  I need to learn some PHP or ASP or something.  I always find books confusing and not thorough enough to completely understand.  Sometimes books are not written well and you learn things in a bad way.  Hard to understand if you've never programmed anything.  I guess I can compare it to driving.  When you first start, if you get bad habits... You never seem to forget them.  Or at least they're hard to get rid of.  The problem with good books is that they teach you the right way, but that seems so tedious.  I remember reading Visual Basic books... And when I wrote code, I'd comment on every line.  I got the idea that comments were crucial.  I would write 100 lines of code and just delete it a week later.  Hours and hours of work and commenting gone.  I've never learned that sometimes you just have to say "Go" and dig in... And figure out details later.  Well yeah...  I don't think I'm doing anything tomorrow other than weight lifting in the morning.  Perhaps I could open that PHP book up and give it a try again.  Another thing before I log off this...  It drives me up the wall (Nah, not exactly, but that seemed correct to say) when people pollute my desk area and go away.. And act like they had nothing to do with it!  Right now on my desk is 1, 2, 3, 4 soda cans... 1 is mine... 1 cup which is dripping water all over the sides... And half empty bag of Cheetos (crunchy Cheetos, if you're curious), a bowl that's empty... And a back scratcher.  That and an empty mouse cage.  Fun.  I'm going to clean this up now.  Night.
