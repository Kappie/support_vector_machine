Our Bishop, Jack Leo Iker, seems to think that he can put his hand over our mouths with inequality, and injustice.  Within the Church, we are even subjected to letters of "pastoral concerns" we are subjected to letters from our Bishop which defile not only the GLBT community, but ourselves for being supporters, or members of the community.    Where is the compassion of our bishop?  Where is the pastoral care that we are all so desperatly calling for?  Crying for?  Why is my bishop more concerned with my sexuality than my vocation to serve God within God's Church?  Why is my priest more willing to follow the wickedness of a earthly figure that he is supposed to be "submissive" to than to listen to the truth of his heart in loving people for who God has created them?  Why?  As a seventeen year old I scream out "why?"    Am I so immature that I cannot grasp the ideals or priorities of adults?  Am I so young that I do not matter in the eyes of my bishop, or my priest?  Am I so "immoral" that they would rather turn their back on me than show me the love of Christ?   I see excuse after excuse from my diocese and the "Network" - I see no Christ-like action being taken.  I am a voiceless child in a diocese that hates me.  I have been called to do bigger, and better things with my life - and thanks be unto God.  This is:  Robby's Heart   Under God's Mercy, Robby D.
