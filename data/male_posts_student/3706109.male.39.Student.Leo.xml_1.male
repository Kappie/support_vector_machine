With over a million sites dedicated to religion, you can find everything from the Christ to the anti-christ, and from the Amish, to Zen Buddhism.  The web really does have a little bit of something for everyone; in fact, it has more.  In a world where it seems there is no way to avoid everyday encounters with some aspect of religion, the web provides us with the opportunity to investigate those encounters and to try and find some sort of answers.  Why are those guys always pushing the watchtower?  What the deal with those Mormon Missionaries?  What is the conflict between Judaism and Islam?  How the hell did the Christians get mixed up in that mess?  The answers are there if you want them, all you have to do is look.  The best part about it? you can pretend that you're not home and just not answer the door.
