Todd, I am perturbed by your critique of my previous post. It's almost as if I was shooting a jumper, and you scoffed at the fact I was shooting it. How rude.  Anyway, I have tons of work to do today, but I will certianly check the blog at least 3 times an hour.  Todd, I will definitely take the Chinatown bus to the NYC...
