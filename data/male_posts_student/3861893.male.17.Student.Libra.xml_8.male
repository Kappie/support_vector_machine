Argentina won their previous match six-nil with a hat-trick from Javier Saviola, and they could have crushed Mexico. Yes, all the goals were scored very late in the second half, but they were still expected to dominate against Mexico. Sigh.  By the way, did anyone tell them that the commentary sucks. The way that fellow talk is so anti-climax that an exciting match could turn out boring. Normally, in the dying minutes of the game, the atmosphere would become more tense and exciting. And yet, with somewhat stupid commentary, the exciting atmosphere doesn't seem to be there anymore. The commentary is a real spoiler. Sigh.  Sigh. Hope Argentina will meet Brazil along the way. Both teams are the champions of South America and it would definitely be a match to look out for. No doubt Brazil is playing their third team with relatively unknowns, but I'm sure Brazil will have their fair share of luck. They always have. Sigh. Brazil doesn't pay any attention to Copa. Winning the Copa is no big deal to them. They pay more attention to World Cup since its obviously more prestigious and more people watches. The whole world watches World Cup.  Sigh. The weekend is going to be over soon. Sigh. Monday again. And the whole week starts. 6 weeks to prelims. Sigh. Can't wait for the next weekend. Sigh. Must really start studying soon. Start taking out those books that have collected dust. Blow off the dust and start reading. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.
