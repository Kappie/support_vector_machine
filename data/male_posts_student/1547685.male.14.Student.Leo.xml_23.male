Each goalie stopped each shot and they were perfect for 3 periods of play. Each time someone had a penalty i would hold my breath to see if one of them scored or not but when it was all over, the score was still 0-0. I was sitting there with sweat running down my forehead and my heart beating 10 times faster then it usually does b/c this perticular game was very intense. The Sharks went into overtime tired but still hopeful of takeing that one game advantage over the St. Louis Blues. It was 4 minutes in when the sharks took it deep in the other teams zone. I rookie by the name of Dimitrakos had the puck and faked the big D out by takeing a fake shot. He brought it closer and closer until...............SCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Shakrs had won in overtime and that crowd went wild!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Sharks next game is on Sunday and i hope that everyone whos reading my blog will atleast take a look at it b/c it is really exciting.   I got a puppet meeting tomorrow so i probably wont be on...............  The Good Friday service was good, nice SHORT message by Pastor and a good time of fellowship after.  Take the Care Bear test....if you answer it truthfully then it will probably pick a good bear that fits you, i know the one that it picked for me was pretty true.
