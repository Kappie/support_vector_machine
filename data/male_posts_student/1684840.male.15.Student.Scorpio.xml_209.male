I couldn't go back to bed really so I stayed up and have begun making a cool movie out of all the photographs and videos we got from Alton Towers.  It's going really well so far, in fact it is nearly finished.  It will not be appearing on the internet due to its file size!    I had the mad idea of revisiting the park tomorrow because we didn't cover amazing rides such as Air or the new Spinball Whizzer.  The original plan was just me and Sam to go again tomorrow, but when Sam couldn't go it changed from that to going with family, then asking Grandma and Grandad if they could take us all, but none of the plans were unfortunaly possible, however we are going to France and London in 2 weeks time!  We get to miss a couple of days off school and see loads of sights    Grandma also said we shall visit Alton Towers in the summer before we go and stay there in the hotel!  I can't wait!  Early rides and lots of fun planned ahead.  I went to Sam's 'party' about 7pm and we messed around and walked around for a bit.  James got drunk on some dodgy Dandelion and Burdock stuff and we were all ripping the piss   He lost one of his bottles it was so funny    All of the photos from Alton Towers are up in the Gallery including the On Ride photos and a video Sam took of us all on Oblivion!
