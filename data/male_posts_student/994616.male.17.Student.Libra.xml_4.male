Take that in both ways the sentence could be interpretted. ie he is acting indifferently to me and I have felt indifferent to him.  His indifferance has been seriously pissing me off though. There, that statement is more accurate. I think he has made the conscious decision that he is going to give me less attention (or negative attention) because I seek attention. However while this is going on he gives Luke Jess and Evan equal ammounts of attention while being an attention seeker himself. Does this seem cool to you? maybe i'm just bugging.
