I'm not into the whole gay scene where everyone just wants to sleep around with whoever and go clubbing for the rest of their lives and TRY to look young and wantable, but that's not me. I'm not planning on bouncing around from man to man for the rest of my life. I want a steady relationship centered on trust, love, friendship, companionship, and just a passion for eachother. I'm not out there for your sex, but for your heart. For your love. So if you want to find someone that will care for you, be your shelter from the storm, and just love you til the day you die, please contact me and we can start getting to know eachother, the sooner the better right? I don't know about you but I've had just about enough of being alone. *sigh* Being single is so overrated. Take care of yourselves. IM me, I'll be waiting for that Mr. Right until he contacts me. Hopefully you're him. The ONE.
