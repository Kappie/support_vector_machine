He also watered some plants and played with the laptop.  Then later on he really did nothing until he had his dinner (creamy caramel shake at JIB) and then went to Kinker's house for poker.  It was an absolutely terrible night.  And now it just got infinity times worse.  Tyke is so freaked out right now.  First of all he lost 50 bucks in poker.  But then here at home he was just blogging when out of NOWHERE a FATTY HUGE spider came crawling out of the vent underneath the desk with the dartboard in the downstairs.  So that made him flinch and then it came closer and Tyke saw it was even bigger than he thought.  This thing is a tarantula.  It probably weighs as much as Tyke does.  Which might not be that much actually but it's still a lot for a spider.  It walked a little bit and then just stopped.  Tyke got so freaked out he jumped up and moved everything that he was using away from it.  Then he went and had to get a picture of it but only had a videocamera near so he grabbed that and went to filming it.  He isn't sure if he got the true girth and hugeness of it but it was just very very big.  He was filming when he decided to inform the people he was talking to online of his troubles and then when he looked back to its spot he didn't see it and his heart stopped.  Then he looked forward and it was running right at him at probably 3 mph which is insane for a spider.  This thing must be on steroids it's so muscular.  It could easily stand on its hind legs and grab the handle on the door to let itself out but it must want to stay inside and feed on Tyke's living body.  But Tyke can't kill it cuz it's so big.  So he ran away from it again when it came at him and then filmed it some more.  This thing has probably eaten little babies.  Not even kidding this time but it most likely wouldn't fit in the hand of a baby, or maybe even Tyke's come to think of it.  If it was hairier than it would almost certainly be a tarantula.  Ok Tyke if itching so much right now.  His mind is playing tricks on him.  He needs something to calm him down.  He just needs to go to his safe room and ponder his next move from there.  He was going to go WWF on the thing and smack it with a chair to kill it but when he looked back at it, it was gone.  It is always one step ahead of Tyke.  How is that even possible?  All Tyke knows is that it has fangs the size of Rhode Island.  And legs like Baja California.  How can it even live?  It has to eat like 3 times as much as any other of its spider friends.  It probably got made fun of as a little spider for being so ogre-ish.  And now it has come after Tyke with a vengeance to get back at his little playmates and prove himself to the gang he is a part of now.  Last night it killed a hooker it met on the street and then dragged her body to the zoo to make a point to the animals there that they could be next but they would never know when.  And now Tyke is about to faint.  *Exhale.
