Monday's airsoft feels like it was last month and the lack of anything to do in class, though nice since I can turn off my brain completely, has made the periods four times as long. So these are my choices. Wait. ARghh. Mean while my english teaher keeps coming up with these stupid annoying touchy feely writings we have to do like have a 20 line dialogue with an EVENT in your life. Geez, what a joke. Yeah so I've been going to bed at like 1AM pretty consistantly which in the past hasn't effected me much but now I'm fallin asleep all over the place. I was on the bus on my way home when all of a sudden I realized my eyes were closed. So I open them as far as I can which is about none then the driver decides to hit the brakes. I'm already all disoriented and almost end up on my face in the aisle. What a jerk I am. Yeah, but tomorrow is the last normal day of school and we have 4 minimum days after that. SAawweettt!
