Some have been caught and published in the Weekly Bugle or the Old paper and pretty soon some may appear on video on News 7 Today. Therefore, warning letters have been sent out to the players concerned to keep their profiles in check or I would enforce a curfew to the whole squad. With the upcoming IVP in September, all players must be in tip top condition and be playing in the right frame of mind. I would like to wish all players a great competition in the upcoming IVP and hope that we will achieve a higher standing this year. Special mention goes to hafiz for being the top scorer in the division 2 league and I wish him all the best in getting those goals in for SP. As for the rest,keep up the good work and good luck!
