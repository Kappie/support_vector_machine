We prepare the whole year for the event, and for two weeks we sit back and enjoy. People flock from around the world to experience this event whcih is unlike any toher event in the world. This uniqueness is what makes it special to me. The Kentucky Derby Festival is not full of run of the mill events that attract the masses. They are a break from the normal. I belive this is the reason it still runs strong to this day. No other place in the world at any other time can you see such a group of misfit events come together to make one amazing experience.   It's the one time of the year everyone is proud of the city they live in. All the problems we face seem to disappear and everyone comes together as a community. We want to show visitors what Louisville truly is about at its core. True southern hospitality. Freindly faces, helping hands, and corteuos people. Derby is a time for celebration. Nothing will get in the way. We are lucky to live in such a great city.   Sometimes the events seem old and commonplace, but then I realize i only get to experience it once a year. At Thunder, I get to see night turned into day. At Bedlam in the Streets, the redneck in us all comes to life. At the Great Steamboat Race, we remember Louisville's history and beginning. At the Great Balloon Race, we get the thrill of seeing dozens of balloons fly over us as we look to the sky. It still amazes me that searching for the balloons in ths sky is such a fun and memorable experience. Then, we get to experience the greatest event on the planet: the Kentucky Derby. An event that can not be described with words.   The moment the horses walk on to the track, your heart speeds up and everyone goes silent. Your eyes are fixed to the TV and the history that is about to take place. The horses are loaded into the gate and the anticipation is to much to hold. The silence erupts into joyous cheers as the horses jet out of the gates. The camera pans as the horses make the first turn, giving you an amazaing view of the  horses and the Twin Spires. People beging to urge their horses on as the jockey for position. Eyes still fized on the TV, people begin to inch closer to the TV as they search for their horse. The best horses begin to emegre from the pack and many viewers see their horses fade from contention. Soon the horses make it to the strecth. Some become silent while others become louder than ever. Then, a horse crosses the line and the race is over. Some jump for joy, others curse, but most jut converse about the amzing race they have jsut seen. Its amazing how one horse race can be so excting. I don't if i get this thrill out of it becasue I am a Louisvillian, but no matter the reason, I hope I never lose my excitment about race.
