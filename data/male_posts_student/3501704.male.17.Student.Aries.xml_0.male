The first 3 months was a haven of fun, everyone seemed so carefree in those early days. I actually looked foward to going to school. Fast foward to now, things are so different nowadays. Stress has overtaken a lot of pple. The class is filled with animosity and misunderstandings. Maybe its just me but i can sense the uneasyness surrounding pple nowadays.   The past month was particularily hard when i found out some pple are hiding their true intentions. ALl i can say is , LET BYGONES BE BYGONES, why continue with this hate and distrust!!I sincerely apologise for whatever missunderstandings caused   Oh well, now its the holidays and its just my luck to be struck with a rather serious illness( herpes affecting my right eye, my face looks like a warzone with spots covering 1/4 of my face  sob sob... :X)last thursday just before my GP exam. HOW SUAY CAN ONE GET!!!!!!!!!!ARgh Had to miss the class bbq, spent most of the time lying in bed or watching tv now. Must recover faster, hope to be well by wednesday.  GOt to go, TATa
