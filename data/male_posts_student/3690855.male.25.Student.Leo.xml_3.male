The new format helps.  I think blocking Chrispy has helped too, because instead of endlessly mocking the sorry son of a bitch, I think of other things to do, like update this.  Well, not a lot has happened since the last update.  I worked on Sunday.  I needed a quick summer job, so I decided to work at a Domino's Pizza in Morrisville, PA.  I used to manage a Domino's in Robbinsville, NJ, but I left last winter for a myriad of reasons, one of which was because I took an 18 credit workload this past semester, including a 15 hour a week internship at SportsRadio 610 WIP in Philadelphia.  The other reason is kind of personal, maybe I'll go into detail about it one day, but don't get your hopes up on that one.  Let's just say it didn't leave me wanting to go back and leave it at that.  Anyway, one of my friends who used to run Robbinsville (Gene from the last update) now works in Morrisville and invited me to work there with him, and since I wouldn't have to deal with my Robbinsville problems, I accepted.  Now, I'm not so sure I should have.  The people there are nice, but I kind of feel like a subsitute teacher when I'm there as opposed to somebody who's in charge.  In Robbinsville, I was the man, but in Morrisville, I'm really just a fill-in.  I don't know, maybe it will get better.  Now for today's rant.  I've been reading "The Bad Guys Won," an account of the 1986 New York Mets and the trials and tribulations they had in winning the World Series.  A good portion of the book talks about Darryl Strawberry and Dwight Gooden.  When I was 10 years old, there were few athletes I admired in the world more than Darryl Strawberry.  Gary Carter may have been the only one.  I remember feeling just horrible when he signed with the Dodgers in '90.  I felt let down by one of my heroes.  With Carter, it wasn't the same because he was really coming up on the end of his career by then.  Darryl was entering his prime, and he and the Mets had gone through so much together, and it seemed like there should have been more chapters in that story.  In retrospect, it may not have been a bad thing that he left, because he ended up self-destructing, which was truly a shame.  But, when I think of a lot of my sports heroes from when I was younger...Darryl Strawberry was right there near the top of the list.  So was Dwight Gooden.  In fact, still to this day, a framed poster of Dwight Gooden from the mid-80's hangs in my room, more because I'm too lazy to take it down than anything.  But I remember using my birthday money to buy that when I was a youngster, which meant a lot because when I was 11 or 12, I just didn't have a lot of money.  Then Doc started having his troubles with drugs, which is human.  I can't fault him for that, I guess.  Then I grew older, Doc lost whatever athletic magic he may have once held, and he left the team, throwing a no-hitter for the Yankees in '95.   He's had his ups and downs, but he's seemingly been in better shape over the last few years than Darryl.  Still, here was another sports hero that turned out to be something less than I hoped.  Not all of my sports heroes were baseball players.  I remember thinking that when the Nets drafted Derrick Coleman, that he was going to be the saviour of the franchise.  DC had so many athletic gifts.  If ability alone determined greatness, Derrick Coleman could have been the best power forward of all time.  The next year, the Nets drafted Kenny Anderson, forming a 1-2 punch that should have carried them throughout the 90's.  Drazen Petrovic was also around to nail down the three's and provide scoring.  I even liked Chris Morris.  They made the playoffs for the first time under Chuck Daly, then the following year contended with the hated Knicks for the Atlantic Division.  Only John Starks cheating and breaking Kenny Anderson's wrist (I still to this day hate him for this) cost them that division.  Everything was going to be okay.  Then, everything wasn't okay.  First, Petro died in the car crash.  Then they drafted Yinka Dare.  Then Chuck Daly left.  Enter Butch Beard.  Beard ended up not being able to control Kenny Anderson and Derrick Coleman.  DC had such a horrible attitude, he was traded so the Nets could draft Shawn Bradley.  Then Kenny Anderson was traded.  It was awful, the team just self-destructed.  And through the years, DC and Kenny never really found their form from when they first came into the league.  DC wound up being one of the worst clubhouse influences of all time.  His attitude withered away what could have been amazing game.  Same with Kenny Anderson.  The point of all of this?  All of my athletic heroes wound up sucking and sucking hard.  Sometimes it was due to addictions, sometimes it was just because they didn't give a crap, but in the end, none of them were the heroes I thought them to be.  And that's the moral to this story.  If you're a kid, don't idolise athletes.  They are human and infallible just like anybody else.  Don't idolise anybody, really.  We all have our flaws as humans.  Just aspire to be the best person you can be day in and day out.  But if you do have to idolise somebody, don't idolise athletes.  Just because they have the skill to hit the ball hard, or to sink the impossible three pointer, or to throw a pinpoint pass in traffic to a wide receiver, does not mean they are a good person.  Respect their athletic abilities, root for the players on your favourite team as hard as you can, but don't idolise them.  Do your best to seperate the person they are on the field from the person they are off of it.  They are, just like you, only human.  That was long.  Next one won't be so long, I promise.
