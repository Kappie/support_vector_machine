If you are not of sufficient interllectual ability to know what I am talking about, I shall not be bothered with stooping to your level. If you don't understand, get out.  OK...that was a bit...lousy. Obviously the people reading this will be smart...including me, not to popular belief.   To the point of the jorunal. On Monday, I went to visit some of my old friends from primary school. I had a crack at his XBOX playing Halo...wthout much success, often falling from the 6th or 7th floor and committing suicide. We also played some table tennis...only for somebody to squirt somewater at the table when the score was tied at 9-9 when I was hitting...2 point slost and the stupid game lost too in the process. Nevertheless, I still felt a strange sense of sadness when it was time to go...(i HAD to go for i had already stayed for 11/2 hours longet than i should). It seems that i am most relaxed when i am with my old friends. Obviously they understand my very...er...essentric character and...don't really mind(I hope). And therefore, I took a longer route home just to stay with them a little longer.  WIERDO! CRAP! Yup, perhaps it was not a good idea to waste even  more time going home. Yet, my parents were out of the country and my sister working until 11pm... no harm done. Back to topic...i feel much more...affection(NO, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT I AM GAY) for my old friends than my new ones.  Am I destined to dread every day I go to school, the only light in the tunnel being the next outing with my old friends? Yes, I admit school life now is better but still cannot comapre lah. Oh well...I have found some new friends now and maybe I will enjoy school life now too. I hope.
