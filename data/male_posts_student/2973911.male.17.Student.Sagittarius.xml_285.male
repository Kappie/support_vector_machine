Actually, I don't drink and I've never ever let a guy get past my barriers. I simply like the dancing.    I love the dancing.   I've checked out most of the site and they have a Ladies' Night on Wednesdays so I guess it's not a gay bar after all.  I say ano and it's bad. It's bad. It's embarrassing in front of an audience. I'm in the Deb Soc, dang it! I'm thinking maybe I should say it's anou. Kinda Japanese, ne?  Ja ne!
