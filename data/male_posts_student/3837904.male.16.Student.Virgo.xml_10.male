He says that he still hold some sort of grudge against me. But why I don't understand. That makes me very sad. And I suppose that today would be the saddest day of my life. On how much that I've begged you and you won't want to accept all that I've said. You've thought all for youself and you've never thought about me just a single bit. Your angerplays now an important role in your life.Maybe I'llplunge to my death and you'll know how much I want you back. I've got no other choice.
