Then I reached home about 11pm and slept about twelve. But it was ok la...cause even if there wasn't a meeting I'll stay up to watch Smallville, although weird they suddenly decided not to show it last night. Missed an episode already, it'll give me more time to catch up this way. Anyway, yesterday was a slacker's day. I got back my Physics paper though, it's 16/30...argh...could have got 20/30 thanks to one stupid careless mistake. Argh...nevermind, must remember to be more careful next time. Then after that slacked in band room. The sec 1s played horrible man! But at least I wasn't very disturbed by it, and could read for a while and even close my eyes to rest. I think it's kinda cool, cause after that I went to the food centre opposite with my friends. It feels so carefree. Then was talking to Miss Koh about the shortage of Clarinets. But she said that we would have to share, cause the school really can't buy more. So we were trying to think of a way to solve the problem. But left quite late la, cause had to settle the problem of the condemned instruments with the sec 1s. Then today, was just another boring day, felt so tired in class, so I decided to write a letter to Yap Min during Physics lesson...hehe...then was like reading my book la. Then after school, I went down to the band room again. I was like just standing there, looking at the people choosing the instruments for auction. Then just left la. haiz...so bored. I kinda miss my jie. Was hoping to go Subway study with her, but realised that she had Theory lessons today. Oh well, so came home quickly, and here I am entering in my blog. This few days I've been just thinking of writing an article for YF life. Especially after such an eventful period. I really learnt alot, and wished to share to my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. Oh well, I better get going there's work and preparation of songs to be done.
