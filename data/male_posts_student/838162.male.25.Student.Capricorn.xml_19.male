Once again we a witness to the mindless horror of terrorist actions. And now it's even closer to home. I had placed my resources and  > to focus on the sniper that has been running wild in Washington D.C. Never expected the next incident to be just next door.  In the meantime lets not forget the so called "minor" incidents that are taking place else where in the region, like in the Philippines. And a reminder people, take a look at the peace around you. May we not take it for granted.  On a lighter note, the newest  Star Wars  novel in the current ongoing   New Jedi Order   series is out. Pity it is hardcover and thus out of my budget, for now. They have however re-released the paperback version of the last hardcover novel from this series that I missed so I got that instead to tide me till next month. For all those wondering, this series takes place 20 years after the end of   The Return of the Jedi  . There is an invasion of an alien race in to the known galaxy and the new and young jedi order raises up to meet them. That makes Luke Skywalker about 41 years old, and he is now a jedi master, an uncle, a husband and most recently, a father. To clear things up, the next Star Wars movie coming out, Episode 3, takes place 20 years before Return of the Jedi. In it we will see how Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, will finally become Darth Vader.    Star Wars related: The latest sourcebook for the Star Wars pen and paper RPG is out. This one focuses on the Jedi themselves and is a good read. But like all sourcebooks, this one is quite ex.  Managed to get my copy of the MMORPG Earth and Beyond working. Seems like the problem was on Pacific Internet side. But to my surprise, they actually got in contact with the group of us who was having trouble and did their best to help us and got it working. That's what I call customer service. I like to see the other ISP give this level of support. Once again many thanks to Pacific Internet and I have no regrets of the choice I made 7 years ago.   To all those having exams. All the best. Will be keeping you guys in my prayers and when I too sit down to study. It is not been going so good my part-time course so far. It is hard to do two modules at the same while I still have my time taken up in camp. I do hope that I can mug and catch up during my leave, which is coming soon Thank God.  Cheers to eveyone, have a great weekend and my your connection never drop.   >
