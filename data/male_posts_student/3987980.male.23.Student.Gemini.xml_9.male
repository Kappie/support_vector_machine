If my story sounds depressing, probably cause my retained memories are generally negative. My family gives me a hard time about that, can't help the way I remember the past. I'll make it as general as I can. Age 5: My first crush was on a girl in my class. She also lived in the same apartment complex so we were friends. On Valentine's Day, our class had us do valentines. I made mine for the girl, but she wasn't at school that day. I decided to give it to her at her home. When I went over after school, no one was there. Nothing was there. Another kid told me her family moved. I was so heart-broken. Massive emotional scarring, I was recluse for years after that. Fast-forward to age 10, my family moves to Mississippi. Possible one of the worse places in the world if you ask me. During the fifth grade, everything was normal at first. I was just a quiet student that did my work and studies. Who knew that was all the reason for the many bullies to target me. Lets just say for the next5 years my life was a living hell and I was on the edge of suicide. I had to get out that place, so I moved in to my father who was in Arlington, Texas. A great city right in the metroplex of Dallas/Ft Worth. With malls, a Six Flags, everything! (being raised in small cities forever I was severally deprived of the real world). I had a new home, new school, new life! It took everything I was to make sucha big decision, especially considering that during my final grade (9th) in Mississippi I fell in love with Lucenda. We even spent a small part of summer at Aviation Ground school together. I questioned my decision to move everytime I saw her, but sometimes one's peace of mind is more important than one's peace of heart. I had three years left of high school and I was going to spend them at Arlington High. They weren't perfect times, but I actually enjoyed those years. Had a few unrequited loves.And I had tomaintained myself from doing anything that could put me in my former social position. That's alot of restraint. I like to be witty, but its hard when you have to question everything before you do it. These days I've abandoned that. What happens happens. I act as I wish and don't allow other's opinion of me to effect me. Besides, I have a future to worry about. I can't be worrying how other's will see me because I made some dumb comment.  Well that's all for this topic. I could blame others for my teenage torture, but in the end I know its because I was weak-willed. I allow others to take advantage of me and I shyed away when I should have just thrown a swift punch.
