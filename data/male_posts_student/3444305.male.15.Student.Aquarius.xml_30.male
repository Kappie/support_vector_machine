It's just that crazy. So I just stayed home. But then me and my parents and brother decided to go over to Peoria. We went to Target, went out to eat at Avantis, and then went to the new mall. It was pretty fun. Then I got home and noticed I had a huge virus on my computer. So because of that, I had to reformat my computer. I wasn't happy as you can tell because reformating takes a long time. So me and my dad did it. And alot of the time is wasted because you dont' have to do anyhting, so I went outside and played basketball. And then something freaky happend. Someone came running, and screaming, and jumped on top of me. I thought I was going to be raped 20 times over. But it just happend to be my good old buddy Andrew. He was walking around, and then he walked to my house. So I went with him and we went back to his house. We played some Primus, which is the coolest band ever, because they are just that random and talk about lost puppies. Anyone that talks about lost puppies is my hero. And then he kicked my butt in some hardcore online games. You got to love Slime Volleyball. If you don't, there is something wrong with you. But he rules at that. And I just suck. Hopefully things get better for ya Andrew. I'm praying that they do. But then after that, it was dark, and I didn't tell my parents where I was going lol, so his mom took me home. But I didn't get in trouble, so that's a plus. And then my dad poped in a movie that we watched. Well I talked online while watching it, becuase I already have seen it. But its an okay movie. And then me and Danetta had a little argument. Danetta, you arn't changing my mind. I did it in your best interests. No matter what you say :-) But really that was my night. Now I'm going to go get some food. Goodnight!
