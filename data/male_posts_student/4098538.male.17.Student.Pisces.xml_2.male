I was planning to go back toanother party at first butCharlie's mum decided to be a biatch and make me go home. But oh well. It was all actually quite funny. I am just really confused now... I don't remember coming home, getting into my house, or anything for that matter. I faintly remember being on the phone to Chelley, then waking up about an hour ago.The PC was still on and I had millions of messages from people thinking I was ignoring them. I love not being able to remember what happened. I just hope nothing too bad happened when I saw my parents!
