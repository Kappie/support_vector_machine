I've been thinking of a site dedicated to rehabilitating emo people like me.  That would be nothing short of, interesting.  Maybe, I should be normal and just make a cool homepage.  After all, that digital camera will be coming soon enough.  So if you want to voice your opinions, please do so.  Any idea is a good idea, well to me anyways. Yea, now that whole thing about the six year old kid was just a goof, I gave being emo a shot.  Shi!  And wouldn't you know it... I'm pretty damn good at it.  But today I reached an all time low.  Actually at this very moment I'm reaching lower and lower...  So you may be wondering what exactly it is that I did.  Well I'll tell you what I did, or am doing.  Hmm... that sounds weird.  Anyways, I am trying to hold a convo with this SmarterChild.  Very interesting to say the least.  Now I just clicked on the 17 and over so that this thing could curse me off, but it just does a bunch of weird things.  Anyways, I suggest that you give it a shot.  It is surprisingly fun.
