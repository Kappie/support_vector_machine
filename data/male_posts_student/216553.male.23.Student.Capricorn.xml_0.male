We're watching the Minesota vs. Sacramento game and prank calling people in the United States.  Actually, we're getting people to call us long distance! lol  Yes, that's what we do for fun on this island!    Well, aside from that, school is getting crazy once again!  I could have never imagined how complicated how epithelial and connective tissue could have been!  Anyhow, back to studying!
