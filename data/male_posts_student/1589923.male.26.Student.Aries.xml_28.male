There are so many factors that triggered my turbulent emotions. So many things that are beyond my grasp and i really wish i can do something about it. I wonder why my life is so full of obstacles and difficulties.. are they created by myself or is it becoz of my fate? i sometimes wish my life would be in a better state but somehow i seem to be experiencing all sorts of issues that simply throw me into a state of uncertainty. Have i chosen the wrong path in my life? are there other ways to experience an easier and comforting life? i love the ppl around, yet i'm unhappy with my life. There are just so many things i wanna change but i have so much constraints that are preventing me from doing so. Life goes on, i still go to school, i go out and and fun and i have a comfortable place to say. BUT beneath all that, there are many issues that say, "look, u are in a huge mess. how u gonna save yrself?" I know that i can give a call back home and probably that will be an easy way out but then, how much can my parents help me? i dun want to be a burden for them coz i know how hard is it for them to be supporting a portion of my education here. I am already contented with that and i try as much not to be dependent on them. sigh.  I'm kinda stuck at a dead end at the moment. i really hate it when things get undone. I wish that everything will just fall into place at this very instant and make my days easier to go by. i feel like switching myself off, and not think about anything at all. A totally blank state of mind is what i'm looking for. i dun know which direction i should head or what should i do. I'm in need of salvation.
