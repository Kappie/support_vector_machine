I was talking to a friend the other day I haven't seen or talked to in a while.  Her name is Kelley.  She was telling me about this nice guys finish last thing her boyfriend sent her.  I read over it and it sounded a lot like me.  I showed it to a few other friends and they said it hit the nail on the head.  All of it except this part about being the guy who is the designated driver and not taking advatage of girls at the door, cause I'm only 15 and can't drive by myself yet.  The link to it is:  urlLink http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/~jenf/writing/rant04.html .  One part sounds a lot like something that happened about a month ago.  If you are a close friend, you know which part.  Well, that is it for now.  If I post tommorow it will probably be about my schedual and back to school stuff.  TTYL
