We bumped into a few people from my college who I had never spoken to before which was pretty cool. I remember getting off with one of them too. God I regret it.Then I bumped into my ex Lauren. She was with one of her friends called Mandy. I have met herbefore...in April or May of 2003.I think she's really nice! I love that she was so sweet and listened to me and took an interest. I don't think she believed me though because of all the crap Lauren has told her about me. I suppose the fact I was a bit drunk didn't help either. The annoying thing is I really meant it too. I will live. I shall post next time something remotely interesting happens to me.
