One year ago now Micheal Dill wished death upon me and God heard his cry. Everyone wish me happy Appendix Day! I'll post recent happenings later. FOR DANIEL....I'M OUT!  By the way, Cassy, if you read this, please forgive me, after we talked I thought, and even if I didn't mean it the way it came out I realized I did wrong and hurt you. I just want things to be how they were before.
