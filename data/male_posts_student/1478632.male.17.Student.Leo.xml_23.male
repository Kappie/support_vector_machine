The only problem is, its just the normal crew :(. Darcie isn't going, Chelsea isn't going to be there, and FaTony won't be going either! What's with that? Anyways...I finished downloading a while bunch of stuff last night:      -1984: Ingsoc+BB=doubleplusungood      -MechWarrior 4 Mercenaries: Beep Beep vrrrr shoom! BAM!      -Diablo II Expansion: Lord of Destruction: Ba'al=weird name for a demon  What else? Today we had a sub in History. Guess who? It was Knowlton! Yes, for the second day in one week, we've had the Knowltonator as a sub. That's  really  cool. Knowlton is the strangest person that I know, and he's a great sub. When we're done our work, he starts some philosophical discussion with us. Today, we didn't have time because we watched the West Wing episode from Wednesday, but the last time we had him as sub, we talked about how girls are wearing things that they shouldn't be, and how guys are wearing things that a couple years ago would make them be called gay (run-on). To end this post, I'd like to say that Ryan Gallant of Pembroke, New Hampshire is a complete and utter moron (see side pane for more details).
