First, I had a comic featured over at  urlLink Stripper's Corner  (which sounds dirtier than it actually is).  Then I had a comic featured in the  urlLink Oklahoma Daily , and someone actually sent me an email in regards to said comic (and the email contained words of praise, no less!).  Also, the girl I submit comics to at the paper sent me an email about some College Cartoonist Award thing I'm going to try for.  So there was a lot of comical love goin' down for the ol' Chuck yesterday.  And now I have another comic in the newspaper again today.  I actually rule that paper now, they just don't realize it yet.  I keep wondering if the other "cartoonists" (having seen their work, I use that term loosely) are going to just quit.  I wish they would; it would mean I didn't have to share my space with hacks.  That's all sounding a lot more conceited than I originally planned, but the fact of the matter is, the rest of the people who do comics here just...aren't really that good.  Either their art is crappy (one guy in particular has a style that's way too jagged and has too many corners, while another has characters who always look like  urlLink this  even when they haven't beaten their heads against a filing cabinet) or the comic's just aren't funny, or they're so specific to a certain time, place, and group, that only about five people are even going to chuckle at the damn thing.  Then again, I've been trying to draw comics since I was in high school, and I also have existing characters with clearly-defined personalities to work with already.  I'm just sort of advantaged in the comiking, I guess.  Anyway, these are all just small steps in my plan to take over the world with humor.  The next step is to convince people to pay me to draw funny pictures.  Once that's going, then all will be well.  Or something.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: The Wallflowers, "Into the Mystic"
