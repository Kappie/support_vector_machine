Foundation should be required high school reading (in no particular order) 1.Asimov  creates good suspense. 2.It is a funny yet true replica of real-life.. a parody. 3.It is realistic (well if when advance 12,000 years). 4.It has a nice theme that a small group can accomplish a lot. 5.It also has a good theme that every society is doomed to crumble.  Happy reading.
