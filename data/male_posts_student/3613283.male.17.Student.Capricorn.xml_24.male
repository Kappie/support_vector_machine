Soon after, France's new Interior Minister,  urlLink Dominique de Villepin , came to the cemetery to address the media saying how the Republic cannot accept these things, how this is against France's values. Yeah yeah, Dominique, we've heard that several times in the past few weeks. After several Jew cemeteries, and Jews being attacked everyday, Neo-Nazis are attacking other communities.  Do you know that in France, not a day passes without at least one anti-semitic action reported?   Words are not enough.  The French government needs to act now. Of course there's already a law about it, but the rules aren't actually put in place: people are just not used to respecting the law in France.
