If somebody takes a photo of it that would be cool; and make sure to ring the hospital beforehand.  So it would be less of a "spontanteous" combustion after all. More like, an organised combustion. Wierd. Anywho, I best stop clogging up the phone lines so Jonno can use it. And I'll try and get around to getting my profile photo working... argh.  "Wide asleep today, and I don't want to leapfrog. Just set me on fire."
