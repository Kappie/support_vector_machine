What the problem is differences in communication, and perspective (which is often gender oriented). They both tell me seemingly completely opposite accounts of conversations. Jokes become attacks, understatements become lies, and soon friendliness turns into anger.  I'm a postmodernist, so I don't believe in objective reality and believe in only subjectivity.  The problem is that in communication there is the issue of transferring thought into speech, and if that isn't hard enough... there is the issue of the receiver having to interpret what the speaker says. That means that an idea goes through multiple filters before reaching its destination. I think this is an issue between my two friends. Saying what you mean is closer to saying what you think you mean. Correspondingly what you hear is what you think you hear. There is a large communicative ravine between speaker and listeners. This is further complicated by their perspectives on one another and their own emotions at present. This means their subject position is an integral part in how they communicate. Unfortunately I don't know how this can lead to a resolution to their problems. Self-relexive discourse perhaps? However that assumes some level of rationality, and how rational can you be if you "feel" you've been hurt by someone you care about?  I feel really bad about this and hope they resolve these issues without coming out of this hating one another.  ***
