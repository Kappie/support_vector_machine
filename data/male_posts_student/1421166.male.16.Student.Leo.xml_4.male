But anyway, yesterday was great, cause I got back my Mother Tongue Paper, and topped the class for my paper 2. Yippee!!! hehe...then had band practice. We played Persis again. But this time with Mr Tan. Phew...thank goodness he wasn't very particular about the running notes, cause I couldn't play them properly and neither could alot of my section members. But it was ok la...he focused on attack and articulation more...then we tried Merry Widow for Musical World. Very nice!!! Then today, I had to go to school again for band. Had sectionals. haiz...I feel so lousy. Not being able sight read well. But guess it takes time. Maybe I just don't have the talent. Then we played Merry Widow during band practice again. But this time it's much nicer...then suddenly I can play more of Persis!!! "There can be miracles..." haha...but really enjoyed today's band practice.  Then, went for YF. I was like learning piano from Nat. But he just couldn't help me understand minor scales. Took so long, but made no progress. We did that until like 3pm. With all the YFers sitting down already. And cause Nat was the song leader also what. So everybody sit down there like listening to us like that. Then my jie just kept giggling away standing at my back. She's always like that. Guess she's just very joyful. haha...that's what people say. It's something good though. Then Min Er tried to understand what we're talking about, but to no avail of course..hehe...sorry Min Er, no offense here. We went for outreach after that. haiz...just didn't get to share. But we gave out alot of "tracks" (don't know how to spell), maybe God will work in His own way. After outreach, Junwen continued the job to help me understand minor scales. And now I noe. The minor scale is 3 semi-tones lower then the Major scale. Yeah...piano very nice what...but some people just don't like it. Wonder why...maybe cause I learnt it on my own accord.  We managed to catch a X-MEN 2 movie at 7pm sharp. It was so cool. all the special powers. I like Nightcrawler. But he looks really scary in the movie. I prefer him in the animation. Then Rogue and Iceman was so cool too! (Iceman was the "coolest", I mean his cold what.) So sad that Pyro joined Magneto. Sigh...but just a show la. Finally, back home. Somehow, I thinked I'm quite determined to learnt piano. I just hope I won't give up. OK...better sleep early tonight, there's church the next morning.
