But today, I slept, I could eat, I cold feel almost calmed. Roz, If you ever read this I want you to know that you are so far the only person who has truly made me feel safe. I spend everyday lost, cold, and confused. Yet the moment I see you, I feel as though I might just figure things out. You help clear my head. And I guess that's why I spend so much time writing to and about you. That's why close to everyday, there is a new picture in my head of what I'd like to draw for you. You, and the thought of you makes me truly happy.
