I can't think of anything more.  I still smell like you though, maybe that will help me finish it.  I don't know, I suck at songwriting.  I just started singing this in my head on the way home from your house, trust me, it has a melody.  Just not a singer worth singing it to you.      Goodnight.  I'm blogged out, I've made like 43234 posts today.  Sorry, I love you.
