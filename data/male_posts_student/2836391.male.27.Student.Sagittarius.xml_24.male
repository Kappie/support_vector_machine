After months of excuses, cancellations, taunts, counter-taunts, grandiose claims and belittling of opponents, the great pool championship challenge was fought.  A best of three series.  The first game, hard fought, some spectacular shots, along with some fairly ordinary play. As the boys sensed victory within their grasp, disaster struck!   For the girls that is....  Judy sunk the black, and the boys had the first round.  The second game was closer. Rory (again) sunk a freebie for the girls, and on his next turn Andy did the same. The girls played valiantly, calling on all their considerable skill, but it was not to be.   Finishing the game, and the series, with a shot even he could not miss, Rory sunk the black, to proclaim the superiority of the Andy/Rory dynamite combination.  So, I say to those who doubted, those who scoffed, those who thought the chances of Andy and I winning to be out of the realms of possibility, I say to you one and all....  Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah!  Judy has however issued a re-challenge, stand by for a further drubbing.
