When an incumbent Republican president can't get these votes he's in trouble.  As things are right now I'll still vote for him as the lesser of two evils.  Here are the problems that I have with him:  My problems don't really revolve around Iraq.  Saddam had chemical weapons and was deceitful about it, with probability 1.  He broke the cease-fire agreement of 1991 and harbored terrorists like Abu Nidal.  And he was just a bloody thug.  Based on the costs and benefits of intervening nobody can really argue that invading Iraq reduced human welfare.  The PR, especially after the prison scandal, has been atrocious, and the administration doesn't deal with crisis very well.  This is what has turned my friends off.  Bush is a terrible spokesman.  Grade:  B+ on the substance, D on the style.   My take on Kerry:  Is vague and aloof really a better PR strategy than tongue-tied and aloof?  I do fear that he'd hang our allies out to dry if something goes wrong.  He's done it before, at least twice.  The more reluctant that he is to intervene somewhere else in the future, the more that our enemies believe that they can get away with.    Also judging from his conduct in the 1980s where he supported the Communists in Nicaragua, he has horribly bad intuition regarding good and bad uses of American power.  And what if the Iraqis try to put Saddam to death?  Would Kerry send in the lawyers?  Likely grade:  C.   My problems don't center around social conservatism.  The president has made nobody happy in his bioethics decisions, but making everybody happy is impossible.  Apart from that the administration hasn't governed in a noticeably conservative way.  Grade:  B+.   My take on Kerry:  Makes Ted Kennedy look like a moderate.  Not likely to make good court appointments or respect personal freedom unless abortion or sex is involved.  Likely grade:  D.   Environmental policy is much the same as Clinton's.  I had been hoping for more innovation here like the 1990 Clean Air Act with incentive-based schemes.  More muddled thinking on environmental policy.  Nothing really new.  Status quo.  Grade:  B-.   My take on Kerry:  He might blunder into doing something innovative.  Then again he might micromanage things like auto emissions standards or alternative fuels without a real understanding of what he's doing.  So far, he's proposing the latter.  Likely grade:  C.   Trade policy has again been a muddle.  While Bush has been pushing for wide-reaching hemispheric trade agreements and making nice with Brazil, he's imposed all sorts of steel tariffs and wrongheaded agricultural policy.  Again there seems to be a lack of serious thinking about incentives.  Grade:  C+.   My take on Kerry:  Voted against NAFTA.  Edwards is his running mate.  Shows no understanding of corporate taxation.  Likely grade:  D-.   No Child Left Behind:  Dead in the water.  Federalizing education without addressing incentives very much--why schools act the way that they do.  Just gives schools more reasons to fatten administrators' pockets at the expense of teachers, parents, and students.  Grade:  D-.   My take on Kerry:  Voted for NCLB.  Opposes school choice.  Strong centralizing impulse.  Likely grade:  F.   Fiscal policy:  Tax cuts, at the expense of making the code even more complicated.  Maybe marginal improvements in incentives for capital formation (reduced cap-gains and inheritance rates).  Timing was a little bit late for much of a Keynesian stimulus.  Also done in conjunction with huge permanent spending increases, so this is more of a tax shift.  I hate stochastic tax rates.  The administration just doesn't understand accounting.  It has a better team now than a few years ago but this isn't saying much.  Grade:  C.   My take on Kerry:  Mixed.  Does have some reasonable advisors left over from the late Clinton administration.  However there's the traditional Democratic tendency to complicate the hell out of things and Kerry's wish to increase spending on health care even more than Bush has.  A divided government might help but my opinion of Congress is not much better right now.  Likely grade:  Either B+ or D.  Depends on whether the Clintonites or populists are in charge and if government is divided.   Civil liberties:  Mention the name "John Ashcroft" and watch some people foam at the mouth.  This was even before he became attorney general; some people are plainly bigoted against the guy.  The fact is, the Constitution is still in effect; Habeas Corpus is still here; the cops or Feds still need a warrant to search you; and it's still a huge federal procedure to be declared an enemy combatant in a time of war.  Mistakes and bad decisions do get made but it isn't clear to me that things are any worse than the 1990s under Janet Reno.  Let's face it; she had a tendency toward clumsy violence and a clear disregard for people.  And nobody can forget her role in the fake child-abuse cases of the 1980s.  The point that I'm making is that we have to judge officeholders against real alternatives, not against some mythical ideal.  By this standard, the current attitude toward civil liberties is OK but can always use some improvement.  Grade:  B.   My take on Kerry:  Not much difference on substance, only style.  Likely grade:  B.  Likely to be better in some areas, worse in others.   Immigration reform:  Neither candidate has done much to give me encouragement on this issue.  I come down in favor of high levels of legal immigration, done in a decent humane way.  By this standard, I'd give a grade of C-.  Could be worse, could be a lot better.   My take on Kerry:  Supports unconditional amnesty for illegals.  He doesn't care much for legal immigration though.  Likely grade:  F.   Security:  Improvements have been made, but do we really need to pretend that old ladies are as much of a security threat as young guys travelling on a one-way ticket paid with cash?  Get real.  Grade:  B-.   My take on Kerry:  I would expect him to put political correctness above effectiveness when it comes to things like airport screening.  At the same time if there's an expensive way to increase security I'm sure he'll support it.  Who the heck knows?  Likely grade:  C+ with a huge standard error.   This is why I still plan on voting for Bush--Kerry offers no affirmative reasons for me to vote for him and plenty of reasons not to.  He's running as the un-Bush but in all the wrong directions.  The antidote to a big-government Republican is not a bigger-government Democrat.  I would have supported a primary challenger to Bush.  Not necessarily McCain, who is off his rocker.  Lieberman, maaaaaaaaaaaaaybe.  This is one election where I wish we had a true "none of the above" option.
