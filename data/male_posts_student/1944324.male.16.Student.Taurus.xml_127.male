I've got an extra one, me and Erin will battle it out there and the winner shall return to Compendium victorious. And as anyone who has seen "Posse Comitatus" knows, Victorious in war shall be made Glorious in peace.   Jonah - I really wish you would post more frequently as you would know that Marten and I have resolved the posting issue, in a calm and resolved manner. Yes, I know. You're all shocked. Michael used diplomatic resources to resove an issue rather than just slitting the offending persons throat.  Erin - I wait for your reply. I hope you consider yourself a worthy opponant. I also hope you had the stomach to finish my post and did not just e-mail Marten in a "hissy-fit" of epic proportions. I also have to say, that quite frankly I don't give a damn if you are a senior. Just means you'll probably be gone next year anyway.  Gratias Tibi Ago Domine will be up Friday  Until next time, I'm Michael Christie, and your ring "The Enemy Within" on CoS. Stay tuned for comedy in the form of "Smack the Pony".
