After graduating from  urlLink Centenary College  in May 2001, I realized that in order to get anything done, I would have to take great strides in self-initiative...no longer was a professor going to be assigning topics, suggesting media to work within, and holding one of five letters over my head, dangling it precariously out-of-reach, causing forced motivation on my part to finish assignments, all the while playing me the fool for the grade.  But outside of college, assignment is a foreign word.  Thus, soon after receiving my sparkling 8 x 10 degree in English from  urlLink Kenneth Schwab , I sat down with a Holiday Inn Express notepad and began writing my goals for the next 12 months.  They were     Write a full-length, feature screenplay Create a new, post-Centenary web presence Find employment in the arts  Start a savings account  Live the bohemian life    Numbers four and five might sound conflicting; they are, but I was just out of undergrad, where all of my meals were paid, rent came from a loan I wasn't paying on, and the Bohemians were the people wearing the cool jackets and talking the same verbose language that I weave at coffee shops.    Now, 20 months after writing it, I can say that I've done everything on that list.  I have two screenplays, worked with an avant-garde  urlLink theatre company , ate a ton of canned tuna, at one point had a savings account, and now have the website.    Is there any catharsis in finishing a list?  I have friends who constantly write lists: to-do today, to-do this week, to-do this lifetime.  Often, the list is never finished...a new episode of Judge Joe Brown comes on at 3:30, pushing studying back thirty minutes and effectively pushing the dry-cleaning back to tomorrow.  If you have to put dry-cleaning on tomorrow's list, then you're most likely going to have to put something on tomorrow's list on a later to-do list.  And this is the easy part.  What about that In One Month list, where you have listed  Lose Weight ,  Volunteer , and  See More Art ?  I guess I should feel relieved that I took care of the list I wrote May 9, 2001, but really, rather than celebrate, I'll probably go grab a bagel, drink a soda, and waste time before I go out tonight.    And to be honest, most of the links on the damn site aren't up.
