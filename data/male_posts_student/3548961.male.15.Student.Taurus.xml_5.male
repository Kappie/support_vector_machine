I'm so excited, it feels like christmas eve, seriously, thats how bad this thing was. it feels like i've been in prison for the last six weeks, even though i can walk on the cast, it still feels like a handicap. Also, it wasn't as bad anymore but now that im not really hurt anymore, it just feels big and doofy and anoying. anyway, for those who read this and enrich they're life by reading mine, im n=sorry i didn't post an entry yesterday, i didn't have much to write about and honestly i din't really feel like writing anything. incidently i think brian is the only one who reads these anyway, so i don't feel like i disapointed the masses or anything. Well, now on the the soccer stuff (you knew it was coming) i have some new cleats that im obsessed with on ebay, they are white puma kings. I nor any of my friends have had puma cleats before so im not sure if you are good, i hope they are, they look like it anyway. plus, i love my puma shoes, they are the most comfy shoes ever so hopefully the cleats will be the same. also, i found my dream cleats. they were champagne puma Ksl's size 10.5, my perfect size. sound perfect right? (not that you would know but they are, take my word for it) i want them so bad but there is a problem, i found them on the united kingdom ebay site and the seller told me upon contact that he will not ship to the u.s. its ok though, i can settle for the ones that i am going to order, i mean its not like these are exactly mediocre cleats anyway. Wish me luck this time, i guess i didn't have enough last time. i hope it works. Also, hannah wilkinson got her opperation on her wisdom teath, she seems to be in good shape though but everyone should tell her they love her. that always makes people feel good. Alright well thats it for tonight. love always -alex p.s. i think i found a way to fix the clock on the time posted thing, thank you brian
