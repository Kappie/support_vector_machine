I've just this minute decided to write another post, so not that much planning has gone into it.  Lets just get into the Random thoughts:  Yep, i've decided to call it random thoughts - ya know, the bit where i just have little discussions about things........anywho......  This could well be the last time i write anything for a week or so because i'm off on my 'holidays' next week to the lake district, so i cant really do anything about that, unless i find a way to post it automatically everyday. Also, i cant post anything tommorow because i'm working 1 -10. So i'm gonna try and make the most out of it today.  On the money front, i'm getting quite wealthy, lol. I was thinking about buying a computer for myself, but then i thought, why the hell do i need one when i already have one, and it wont be that long before my dad gives in and buys a new one anyway, because this ones on life support. Anyway, i shouldnt really get used to the rich and famous life...well rich life anyway, cuz most of the money i've made will be gone after i spend it paying for the Bournemouth trip me and the ladz are going on. Should be good fun anyway, providing it doesnt rain...and that we get in in the first place. Anyway, besides that, i hope to have a good time and i hope everyone else does. I did have something to say that i hope to do there, but its completely gone out of my head. Couldnt of been that important if i cant remember it. Oh wait, i know now. I was gonna say i hope to make a lot of video footage, along with Martin aswell, and then hopefully put it altogether into one film with music and put it on DVD, which depending on what happens in Bournemouth, should be a great little film. I'm just trying to think of what music to put in the background....and i wont be taking any suggestions from Ross and Sam. I think that a Beatles song could fit in well with it. But, we'll see what happens on the footage and whether i think of anything else. And Martin may have to load the footage onto his computer anyway cuz i dont have a computer lead for my phone, so hopefully, his will work on mine. I doubt it though, as their different phones. Maybe Ross might.   Anyway, got no major topic to discuss today, so i'll leave it there, and have a new column here.
