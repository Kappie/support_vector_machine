Than after the delicious soup i looked up all the songs i needed to learn for our band practice and i learned 4 in 20 minutes!! thats pretty good conisdering how much i lack in smartness:) So anywho after i pracitced i sat in my room and talked on the computer Spencer and i told him to rip Jc Superska off his brand new Skavenjah cd. So he did so and sent it to me and i actually just finished listening to it!! So after that i had to go to band practice so i walked there and it was raining.. i love the rain it smells good:) So i get to Adams house and we went into his computer room and i watched him and Mike play Stick RPG or something like that and it was funny because its a stick figure and u have to make moneyu and stuff and u can get drunk, buy cocaine, get into bar fights and rob the conveinance store or bank. So we finished playing that aand went downstairs to set up our equipment and than Bryce finally showed up and so practice went on!!! so we practiced and practiced and got every song down and than we had to think of more songs to play since we are playing a show at mikes dads birthday party on july 2nd. So after we picked a few songs which includes "I'm A Believer" Adam asked if we wanted pizza but we didnt have money so i went home and Bryce went home and Mike and Adam stayed at his house and ate pizza. So i went home and ate and bryce called me to watch Halloween 4 but instead we picked out Scream (courtesy of Jungle Jims Video)gotta love JJ video! Me and Bryce than went to kleins and i bought a Hersheys Smore's bar and a slurpee and than we went to Bryces house. I found out that Hersheys Smore's bars are not great at all so i gave mine to bryce and the other one to his brother Brendon. We watched the movie and it was pretty cool and than we watched the rest of family guy and it was funny. After all that t.v. watchin we went downstairs and played some N64 and first we played Tony Hawk Pro Skater and realized that the t.v. was really crappy and we could barely see so instead we played Goldeneye 007. I beat the poop out of Bryce because of my great 007 skills. When the score reached somewhere around 17-4 for me i saw that it was time to go home so i got Bryce to take me to the door and i got on my scooter and scootered home. Now im here telling all of you what happened tonight and im going to bed so good night all!!  *-*Matty*-*
