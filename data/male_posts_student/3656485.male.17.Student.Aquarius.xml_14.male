Inever mean to hurt anyone's feelings. However, people aren't always what you hope them to be. I'd really like to start off with apologizing for my less-than-perfect explanation when you told me. I felt like such a jackass afterwards. I wish that I could have explained my self a little more clearly. Better. However, I'd like to save that for an opportunity outside the posted word.    My main concernnow isthat it feels like I've lost a good friend. I was excited about the inviteto your party actually (I even managed to call off the ballacrosse, haha). You may have noticed my lack of gift though. And I think that actually signified the biggest problem I had with your statement the other night. That being, I don't know you. What do you really want? Who are you? What's YOUR deepest darkest secret? I'd really like to know more. If you desire attention and approval I'll be here for you. But for the time being I thinkthe third is unavailable.
