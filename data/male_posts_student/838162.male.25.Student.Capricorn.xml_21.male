It only appears in the   >  therefore I’m unable to provide a link (grrr..). It can be found on page L6, under the  Straight Talk  column by  Samuel Lee .  Basically it talks about how couples who have just recently broken up should have some time apart from each other even if it was done amicably and they want to remain friends. It then goes on to discuss about how it is difficult especially for the guys because we (guys) than to be territorial. We may start out with good intentions but ultimately we just can’t let go. We get all jealous and moody and over protective. In the end it just serves to drive the girl nuts and further away.  So I would like to open this topic up to discussion. Would recommend that you read the article first before jumping in.  To All the guys: Do you think this is true? Are we really that insecure? It is possible to restore a platonic relationship with an ex-girl friend?  To all the ladies: Have you any experiences with this kind of male behavior? How about the flipside, do you think girls find it hard to let go of ex-boyfriends as well and then try to be friends but display this kind of territorial (but more subtle I think) behavior?  Feel free to post to the comments (found below) or the tag-board to the left of the blog.    >    fAl   speaks: “ *raises hand* I’ll be the first to admit that I have been guilty of this. It’s funny. I read up about this long ago and told myself to be aware of it but when the time came, I completely didn’t recognize the symptoms. And now it’s too late. I will not go into detail but I just like to add that this kind of over-bearingness can happen even during a relationship. And if not corrected, there she will go. And after the breakup, if one would carry on with this, it will only drive her further away. To the guys take heed, do not take her for granted, yet do not react with over-possessiveness.   *sigh*      >
