Well today was my 17th birthday, meaning that I can finally get out on the road driving. I won't be burning rubber today though, as my provisional license hasn't come through yet as a result of my laziness. Which brings me to my special 'birthday resolution'. I WILL NOT BE LAZY WITH HOMEWORK OR ANYTHING ELSE REQUIRING WORK!  Being 17 has also made me realise just how close I am to being flung out into the real world. In only 20 month's time, I'll have finished school and will hopefully be off on a 10 month holiday around the world. After that it'll be off to university, and then out on my own in the crazy world of work and careers. Doesn't time fly?
