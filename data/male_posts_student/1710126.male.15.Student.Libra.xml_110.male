Physics is gonna be screwed. Dint really pay attention in class, coz tired during physics...cant stay awake...and i juz dun like magnetism........guess i hafta go mug..then all the subjects suddenly so intense, rushing out topics especially maths, and art is getting more and more demanding coz with so much on my hands i cannot schedule a time to film my cousin etc coz they have their own lives too. And recently sick somemore...with ORA, cannot do alota work...  Aiyarh i guess i can still cope lahz, juz gotta focus more...gave up on watching any movies le...but gotta focus on studying...FOCUS......and of coz i still gotta do a gd job of the other stuff.......  But without all these life would be watery..whats the pt then hahaz. I'd rather have no time then too much time...like juz a few weeks back when everything was slow paced and i juz felt dead. Routine. Go school go home slack arnd do some written work, laze arnd, eat, sleep. Felt horrible. No emotions at all, no urgency no desperation, no joy, juz bored, empty. The void is really scary. I'd rather feel negative emotions than have a void.  So i guess i juz have ta juggle everything properly and stop dropping balls on the ground...hmz. I'm sure i can do it. but i wonder if i shuld go sleep now to start a fresh day or continue struggling my work out. Its too late to do animore art so i guess i'll concentrate on chemistry first.......  gd nite
