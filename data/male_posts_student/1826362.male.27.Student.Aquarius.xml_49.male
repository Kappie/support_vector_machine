But i didn't know that (nobody told me) until i got to my apartment and there was a sign that said that my stuff had been relocated to the gym.  When I got to the gym I found my stuff haning on a rack, but all that was there was one black polo shirt and a couple of empty hangers.  But then I also found this trunk that had women's underware in it that was also somehow my trunk, and they were all different sizes, but all varients of "small"  ranging from "small' to extra extra small.
