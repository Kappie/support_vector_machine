AAAAAAAHHHHHHHh ok well i just typed a nice little paragraph about todays dirtbiking mishap and once again my computer freezes as i click the save button. so now i'm going to write a different article about how i hate everything! although i hate people that whine, i'll cut myself some slack and complain for a minute. i hate mustard, i hate rap, i hate the people who came up with the idea of putting silent letters in words, and the guy who invented the letter "C" because it's either an "S'' or a "K" (believe me, we don't need a C in the alphabet). back to stuff i hate-- i hate everything school related, i hate the fact that i don't have any super powers, i hate ranch dressing (eventhough everyone else seems to like it), i hate the song "i hate everything" by garth brooks--not his best work : ( did i say i hate rap, cuz that one's at the top of the list! i also hate how so many people listen to rap even though there's nothing musical about it. usually when i go to a  music  consert, i expect to see instruments; i don't expect to see a bunch of guys talk really fast about how 'pimp' they are despite what the 'hoes' have to say. common!! they don't even sign. and the freakin 'bling bling'? only mr. T is cool enough to pull that off. and platinum teeth? well that's cool, like the jaws guy in james bond--sweet. "well to finish this off, i hate how there's too many annoying things to name in this blog. why not one more eh? i hate the people who don't turn their cell phones off in movies, and i really really hate the people who answer them aaahhhh die people who answer thier cell phones while not in an appropriate place. um... i feel better now -steve p.s. i also hate pop-ups  junk mail with a passion
