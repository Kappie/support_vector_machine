The "dog handlers" wave as I pass them by, entering the chapel through the open sides. Occasionally, during the service, I will glance at the doors, hung flush to the ceiling, and ponder the question posed by Greg in the dining hall: "What would happen if one of them fell?" The service begins with the processional, which was usually a song i didn't know. Once, however, there was amazing grace, a familiar tune, and on Sunday the recessional was "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Coming." While I knew the first verse by heart, I was hopelessly lost on the second without the psalm sheet. The two Senior Patrol Leaders beside me didn't have sheets, either, and didn't seem to make an effort to sing. Most didn't, really, and given the substandard nature of my singing I almost took the hint. Perhaps I really am tone deaf. Father Chris mounts the altar, and the service begins. He has a fine voice, and I manage to learn quickly most of the elements of the mass. The readers are always younger scouts, not entirely sure of themselves at the pulpit. I could have spoken, but what impression would I have made? The entire week i took communion not once. I sheepishly stood aside while others filed past me on Sunday, to the suppressed befuddlement of those two SPL's as they walked to the back of the church to take the host from an adult minister. I sat down while everyone else stood, giving thought to entirely irrelevant considerations: Buddhism, the empty nature of communion for those who take it unthinkingly, and what I would say were someone to ask me my justification for not taking communion. Sure, I was never baptized, but I also was never confessed. Buddhism begins to seem like a natural progression, an introspective faith devoted to nonviolence and detachment; sounds familiar when i write this now, though. Asceticism seems to be attractive up to a certain point, but the boundaries and exact circumstances remain vague. The week ended without a definitive answer to that question. My finger is a bit more trained at the shutter; capturing moments seems more natural. It's easier to take photos when Iâ€™m convinced that film and the processing are cheap, and the few good photos justify the expense of processing and taking those that honestly wouldn't be worth it alone. I'm one week and six rolls of film closer to being the photographer i should have been all along. Farewell, Camp Yawgoog. I knew ye well.
