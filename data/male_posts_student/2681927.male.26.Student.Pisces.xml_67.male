'We believe Lance,' Mayo was quoted by Sporza as saying. 'We know that Le Monde has pursued him for five years with all sorts of untrue stories. It was also the newspaper that wrote in 1999 that he used forbidden products. But they forgot to say that he had a medical certificate for them.'"  And by the way,  urlLink the Tour  starts July 3rd. This blog will probably become a Tour de France-blog then. If I have a go right now predicting which riders who will compete for the yellow jersey, I'll have to be boring and say Iban Mayo, Lance Armstrong and perhaps Jan Ullrich.
