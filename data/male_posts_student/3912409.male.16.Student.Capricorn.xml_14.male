Well I had tennis lessons for the last time till my tournament on saturday. I was playing horrible.... but I was still undefeated :D... I was trying to play Wes, but he gave up fairly quickly.  I watched another 5 straight episodes of Hikaru no Go last night..... errrr.... this morning.... errrrr... until 1:30-ish in the morning. I'm almost done the series, I'm on episode 66 I believe and I am currently downloading the rest of the series. I've got about 20 episodes of other anime that I haven't watched... so I better watch those soon, but I'm so obsessed with Hikaru no Go at the moment.  lol I had to make my own supper tonight.... I made some hotdogs and french fries *thumbs up*, aren't I the fancy chef.    Hmmmm.... there's nothing on tv at the moment... maybe I'll go watch some of those fansubbed anime that are collecting on my computer. Yeah, k... so I guess I'm off for the moment.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   lol I'm not sure if this test was made for girls... but.... yah whatever     urlLink     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     HAHAHA!!!... thats pretty funny   You're Exotic Dancer Barbie.
