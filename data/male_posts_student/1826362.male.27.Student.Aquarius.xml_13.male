Steam rolling off a mug, a few drops of cream swirling around in the blackness.  When it's good there's a thickness to it, an oily layer full of goodness floating on top.  I have dozens of coffee mugs all of which I love.  there are the  urlLink sci-fi  movie marathon ones, a bowling mug, footballasaurus, batman and robin, and scooby doo.  But my favorie mug is my newest.  It's one of those stainless steel jobbies, a travel mug that was given to me recently.  It's slick and shiny and has panda bear stickers along the bottom.
