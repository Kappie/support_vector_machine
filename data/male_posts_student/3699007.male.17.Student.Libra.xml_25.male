Of course, if it doesn't go right, then, well, let's try not to think about that.  Surgery is the only option.  She was told that if she didn't have surgery that she would die within a month.  I guess I will have to go to the hospital this weekend to see her.  It is something I don't want to do, but I know I need to.  I hate hospitals...they freak me out.  Britt just called me and wanted me to go to the movies tonight (again).  I told him no, because I just didn't feel like getting home at 1 in the morning, and because, hopefully, I'll get to talk to Amie tonight before she leaves for a week.  I can't think of anything else to say, so I'm gonna go find something to do to occupy myself.  Later.
