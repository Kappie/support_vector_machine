Anyhoo, i'm on holiday now - what fun - and its time to revise. Thats what comes of having mocks on the first day of school next term.  One rather nice thing I must relate is my experience with the Dell customer support pages:  Downloads: Drivers: Inspiron 8200: Ati Mobility 9000: Last updated... (wait for it... wait for it...) January. Last year. OOOH!!!!! Wunderfulllll - Moomy, can I have a dell for christmas???!? Regardless, the drivers I had were crap. They supported stuff but crashed straight away. The drivers before them could only support pong.  So I sent an email to the technical support people. "Our commitment is to reply within 4 hours". Yeah, my arse. It is now 2 months since I sent 2 emails (one week between the two) 4 hours my large, sweating buttocks.  Anyway, it turned out that they were still updateing the drivers for my card, (M9), but only for the Inspiron 8500/8600. When I got them off a freind who has an 8500, it said "INF driver file not found" - in english, this means "FUCK OFF, WE DON'T WANT YOU TO UPGRADE YOUR DRIVERS. HAHAHAHA". What to do? Ah, yes. Force the drivers down the proverbial throat of Windows.   I wont go into the gorey details, but 10 scalpal blades  a lot of blood later I removed my hand from the wound and found my new "incompatible" drivers work absolutly perfectly. Great!
