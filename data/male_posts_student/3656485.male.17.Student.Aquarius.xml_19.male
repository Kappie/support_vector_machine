What a terrible feeling to know that that day has not quite come yet... I met  a nice guy name Julio. He's tight. Karen is also really nice. I think I shall enjoy the benefits of employment.  I have also come to the conclusion that nobody needs plans. At least it always seems to be the case with kids these days. I say, whatever... To you sirs and madams who tend not to have plans.... ever.   I want to work at the circus and wrestle lions. Thank you.
