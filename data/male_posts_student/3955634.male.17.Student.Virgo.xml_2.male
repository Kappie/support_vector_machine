This only serves to highlight the oxymoron "War on Terror" carried on by President Bush. Supporting, for example, the Israeli security fence (also known as a wall) along the West Bank does more to promote further terrorist activity against the United States and Israel than to prevent it.  You can't kill all your problems away, or wall them off. It takes a lot more, and in four years of leading this nation, President Bush has yet to show he is committed to actually resolving the crisis in Palestine, and in turn, seriously healing the terror-breeding woundsin the Middle East.
