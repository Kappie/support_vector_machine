I think one little foray into current events wouldn't kill us, would it?     urlLink President Bush Orders Abu Ghraib Prison Demolished   Yeah, this sounds like a good idea. It will wash away all the reminders of Saddam's regime. Wait... it'll also wash away the reminders of when the prison was originally built by the British during their occupation of Iraq after World War One. And how they were driven out by the Iraqis after a horrible and violent 20-year occupation.  Pity. Methinks Bush could use a reminder like that.     urlLink President Reagan Dies   Does the fact that he died really change the fact that he  wasn't  a "Great Man" or a "Great President" or a "Great Communicator"? Must we insert emotion and passion where there was none, simply to the end of 'having respect for the dead'? Of course I have respect for him - as a President and a human being. Not for something that he wasn't.  ...that the media wish to ignore it and blow Reagan up into a kind of fuzzy-wuzzy doll who just smiled a lot and made everybody feel good about themselves, while slaying communism with his bare hands. ( urlLink Eric Alterman )      urlLink President Bush Announces New Vision for Space Exploration Program   The space program is something I feel very strongly about, for reasons I might go into in a post later. My comment here isn't about Bush's program, specifically (although, it is one of the ONLY things I would agree with him on, if I knew he was serious about it). Bluntly: we need to quit dicking around. When you're dealing with what is literally  one of  (the) most important function we could be performing as a species, you need to quit dicking around with reducing budgets and fucking up decimal places and messing up metric and American unit systems. We need a strong, fast, efficient, and reliable space program NOW.   Then again, if we can't come together on one (relatively) simple thing like ensuring the future survival of our species, we deserve to sit here and rot in our own corpulent waste.     urlLink Memo Says Bush Not Restricted by Torture Bans    In other news, President Bush today annouced the re-institution of the Federal Rack, Iron Maiden and Cat-O'-Nine-Tails. In the unveiling ceremony, he commented, "We's gonna whoop us some 'Raqis! Whoo-ee, I haven't had this much fun since ropin' negroes down at the ranch!"      urlLink Warner Bros. Distributes Military-Style Night Vision Goggles to Cinemas To Stop Bootlegging   Hooray for sprawling, obscene megaconglomerates with unrestricted power! It's not like we have war going on anywhere were soldiers might need night vision goggles.
