It was Fran's b/d last Wed... her party on Thursday!  So we all went there (minus an Ian... he claims due to coursework, I claim it's lieeeees :p) so I was winding him up trying to make him come :p.  So loads of ppl met up in McDonalds in Castle Gardens... but Fran forgot to account for the fact it was the England match!  So we all wanted to go watch it :| planning lol.  In the end we came to a compramise: Rilleys :p play pool and watch the match!  I got a tad tipsy after a few too many pints!  Still managed to win a suprisingly high number of games :p but then Ruth, Sam and Jamie left... which soured the mood a tad... they all went to get pizza and get the bus!  I mean Fran's ment to be like their best friend!  So they leave half way thru her party to go home!!  So she was far from impressed :s and then England lost so we all left.  Fran offered me a lift with her mum... who was there within 5 mins :| (West Cross to town!!  Should take about 15!) still wearing her England shit, I suddenly realised it wasn't a great idea :p was a tad scared lol.  Theeen... Kung Fu... Angi, Hannah, Charlotte and Dai braught down alcohol!  Ooo dear, second night drinking!  Got absolutely plastered and mildly annoyed Angi by drinking her (full) drink when she gave it to me to hold for 2 mins while she went outside for a cigarette :p whoopsie!  Then came home, said many things I shouldn'tve to people online... whoopsie again!  I think I've corrected them all now :s haha  On Saturday... went out shopping :) my mum's birthday, failed to get a pressie but never mind, I'm going into town again twice this week!  Buuuuuuuuuuuut, at random, I gotta txt from Sophia :) aint tlked 2 her in soooooooooooooo long!  We hadda massive txt convo, talked on the fone for about an hour last night and arranged to go for a few pints on Thursday to catch up :) *sigh* been so long!  Ooo and on Friday, I'm meetin up with Rachey and goin to see Shrek 2!  (no-one else wanted to :( miserable buggers!) so we're goin by ourselves!  Ah well, should be good!  I really cant be arsed with college anymore.  Jonny B came into physics half hour late coz his mum's away (we were all over his house yesterday being noisy when his mum rang :p ooo dear :p) and we were really bored... so we mitched the rest of the day, went over his house, teased his kittens, played games and ate angel delight which was most fun!  I have to hand my physics coursework in tomorrow, so I best go do that!  ahh who'm I kidding, I'm going to play TimeSplitters :p
