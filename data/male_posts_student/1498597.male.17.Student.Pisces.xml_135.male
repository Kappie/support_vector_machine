Yeah, thats right, thinkin'.  Its somethin' that people around here rarely do.  Or rather, they do think, but what they think about can be considered...idiotic, or useless...minor I guess, on a major to minor scale.  What the fuck is up with that exactly?  Why don't people think?  Is it that they don't want to?  Is it because their minds are so hopelessy mundane that they just can't do it?  Is it because they don't care?  Is it because there is nothin' to really fuckin' be concerned about?  Maybe the public has not been properly informed and they have been given the false impression that there is nothin' really wrong out there, when in fact the world is seriously fucked up.  Well, I dunno why I'm so pissed off about this.  But then again, maybe I do.  I see people out there, driven in their nice cars with seemingly perfect lives and not a care in the world.  Now they are annoyin'.  Like seriously fuckin' annoyin'.  Its like the problems of the world don't bother them.  Even more annoyin' is the people who have all of what the people I mentioned above have and they have the nerve to complain about crap that isn't even worth givin' a shit about.  Their lives are so perfect, yet they bitch and bitch and bitch continuously.  On and on they go...They could fuckin' give the  Energizer Bunny  a run for his money!  I notice the irony how  I  am complainin' at this moment.  But I'm not really done tryin' to prove my point here.  Here we go.  I think that these people should really stop bitchin' about there damn pseudo-problems ( pseudo  means  fake ) and open their fuckin' eyes and seriously realize whats goin' on in the world today and look for the real things that can be considered problems.  There are tons of problems out there right now that society should really give there attention to instead of complainin' about crap.  Right now, I was just thinkin',"Wow, my life sucks..."   But then I began to think about that a little more.  I know that, in reality, life sucks for everyone.  Maybe some more than others.  I just think that people need to open up their eyes, broaden their scope, and try and band together, make these fuckin' problems known to the world and try and improve things!  Alright, I hope that came out with a lot of enthusiasm...Anyway...I'm just tryin' to say,"Hey motherfuckers, wake up, you think we got a fucked up world?  Well lets try and makes things better!"  More to come...!
