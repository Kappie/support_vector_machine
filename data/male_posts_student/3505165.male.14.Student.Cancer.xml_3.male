When we get screened for scoliosis in school each year, they always say that I have it and suggest that I have my doctor look at it. Well, this time, the doctor told me to do all the regular stuff (bend down, touch your toes, stand up straight and spin around in circles) and he said that I have mild scoliosis but it is due to the fact that one of my legs is shorter than the other. Then he called my dad in, and was pointing out how my hips are tilted, and the line at the fold of skin at the bottom of my knee-pit (that's the back of your knee for those of you without my specialized vocabulary) is at slightly different heights on each leg becuase of the difference in lengths.  Well, now at least I can say that I am one of the few people I know that has legs of different lengths.   I FEEL SOOOO SPECIAL   This is "Different-Leg-Length Boy" signing off.
