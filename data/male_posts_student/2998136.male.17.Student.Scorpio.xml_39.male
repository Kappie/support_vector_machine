I got an A for my Networking Fundamental(NWF), B for my PC Architecture(PCA) and B for my Multimedia Content Creation(MCC). Just as what I had predicted, it came true! I felt quite satisfied and at the same time, felt very depressed because I know I would have done better, at least both module an A. Since even my close friend Song Chuan could achieved all straight 'A's, it was beautiful. During the June vacation, I wouldn't dare to check it because sometimes it's good to not know anything than to know everything. At least, I would be happier and my holiday mood is not ruined. But I had been worrying about my results when I restrained myself for not checking. Curiousity kills the cat, I remember.  You see, this is how I predicted my grades. I did not manage to hand in my Assignment 3 and 4 for my PCA, so even if my overall score is high. I wouldn't be able to get a grade A, how could a teacher grade a student A when he or she did not hand in all assignments? It's reasonable enough and I accept the fact that I should deserve a B. It's just being fair to the rest.  As for my MCC, how could I expect a grade A when I did not hand in my assignment punctually and my assignment 2 is not completed, furthermore I did not add any content or information inside. I was grateful that I got a B, I wouldn't dare to expect much. It was disheartening for a student like me who can achieve A not to deserve it. For my NWF, I knew it at the beginning I might get an A because I know my test results were quite above average and I had put in a lot of effort into my assignments that can be binded into a textbook. And since this teacher have to grade a student according to the test results and assignments, there's no way he could soley make a decision based on his judgement. He had to go by the book, add up our overall results and grade.  Blame it on my lazy attitude and slowness and whatever bad things, now I just want to be free from whatever CCAs or activities that last time I had devoted much of my time into. Especially Modern Dance and Entrepreneur Club, last time I had this YEP Project going to Cambodia to help assemble PCs. Every Saturday was like that "burned" away, now I am gonna free myself. Just as I thought I had washed my hands off those, Aisin this kind of classmate recommend me a job at the convenience shop in Esplanade. She told me the working hours there is flexible and the pay rate is $5 per hour. It is easy job, not much of things to do. Just tend the shop, restocks the drinks, sweep the floor, perhaps mop the floor, etc. I kind of like this job, because it's easy money to earn. Where can you find such an easy and relaxing job which provides flexible working hours, it's totally an ideal part-time job for students who want to earn some quick-cash.  If you are interested, they are still hiring people. So please either approach me or Aisin for the details.  This is getting late and I got to sleep for tomorrow's lessons.
