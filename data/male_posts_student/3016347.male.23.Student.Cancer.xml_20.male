STARHILL!!!! hahahahaha.......gucci? armani? ralph lauren? dkny? or.........ck? hahahaha....... but the nice thing is tat it has been awhile since our family had something good to celebrate......the last time was in 1993, my uncle got married but passed away in 1999.  tat is the reason y my grandma became a grumpy person but still, she still cares for me and i still cares for her. my mom, aunt and uncle complained about her but does anyone of them knew how it is like to lose a son? or have to attend her own son funeral? no one knew and to make things worse, they r not understanding at all. is is getting old and weak but one thing i wish for is tat i hope tat she will get to see my child (i don wan to be alone!!!), her great grandson.
