Recently, I've been having satisfaction. Satisfaction that I haven't had for a long time. Yet, incomplete satisfaction. My life consists of school, band and school and band. (now, not so much of band anymore) But obviously, there is something lacking. Even though I do not have to face unnecessary problems anymore, I do not have the contentment found in a rich spiritual life, a blooming relationship with, if I still in any way display that, my personal Lord and Saviour, and Friend. Basically, God. Reaching the invisible God. All the more because of God's invisible qualities, He is more real to us. We reach out and find Him there. But the question is not whether He's there when we reach out, but rather, do we want to even bother trying what would seem the most absurd and make believe thing. To reach out to a 'non-existent' God (in terms of scientific protocol). I realised that I do not have a problem with prayer. In fact, God promises to help in prayer. But the problem is that I can't get myself down to pray. It all seems as though that there is no reality of a conversation in 'speaking to air'. Everytime I get down to pray, I find myself performing my usual utterance that cease to mean anything, all this done and spoken into air. There is no assurance that anyone is actually listening, and in fact, logically, our mind just rejects such an activity as ridiculous and nonsensical. Yet the wisdom of Man is foolishness to God. What may seem as silly activity of self utterance is actually to God, a very real conversation that engages the soul and mind of a person? Since when was God logical in our eyes and reasoning? Did God chose the rich over the poor, displaying favouritism? 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven'. The Beatitudes in Matthew 5 tells us that. The qualities that we learn of God is unlogical to human understanding, how could we then expect a God that pertains to our understanding? How can possibly demand a logical reasoning to the mysterious activity of prayer? If God were like us, all would be lost. But God is not like us, instead He sent His Son to die for us that we might be reconciled through Him, to our loving Father. What greater love is than one that lays down His life for His friend. Agape.
