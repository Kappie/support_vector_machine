This blog will have a large say in whether or not he does get to bed on time.  After writing that sentence Tyke sat in his chair slouched for about 30 seconds and kinda rubbed his chin and his left eye and thought about his blog streak and his trip to Europe.  Then he wrote.  Tyke will try and inform you on what he is physically doing while blogging more often he has decided.  It is a good space filler.  And can at times be funny.  Today was at times funny.  As most days are.  Tyke had to get ready a little more than normal before leaving to school today.  Because of such items as CDs and hats and such.  1st period really was a pretty easy day and didn't feel too horrible.  The teacher looked more like a man than usual today though.  But he wasn't too bad.  She wasn't too bad, Tyke means.  Then weight training was fun because they started doing testing.  And of course they started out with dots.  Tyke owned dots pretty well last semester.  And then his whole group went and most of the class did and they were pretty bad.  So Tyke felt good about his time.  Macaroon somehow had an insane time though and there is no way Tyke can beat that.  Probably not even within 2 seconds.  Oh, and it was legs day so Tyke kept working out his legs and especially his calves.  He sorta wished after school that he hadn't worked out so hard but he'll talk about that later.  3rd period had an interesting beginning.  On Friday Tyke turned in an assignment that he had just decided to totally make up funny answers to.  And then he turned it in.  Well to start off the period the teacher came up to Tyke and said she wanted to see him after school.  Haha, whoops.  Looks like that might not have been the best idea.  But he decided he didn't really want to go meet her after school.  So he didn't.  Shouldn't be a problem as he wasn't the only one she wanted to see and Tyke and he decided together they weren't gonna go.  Strength in numbers.  Tyke isn't afraid to see her, but he just thinks it would be a waste of valuable time.  Time is a commodity to Tyke.  He needs to cherish it and not waste it talking to a teacher about a silly little homework assignment.  But she still can't do anything to him even if he didn't come after school.  She probably forgot anyway.  Ha!  It is all funny.  4th period was pretty fun today.  The class all read some of the poems they had to write to turn in and Tyke's went over well as usual.  So did Amed's.  Amed took off where Tyke left off last time and wrote a nice wanton (gotta pronounce it Wahnt-uhn in this case) poem as well as another sexually explicit poem.  And those are the best of course.  For lunch the gang went to Pie but Tyke, Doc P, and Amed decided to head there right after they got out of 4th period (which is a few minutes early every day) and they managed to beat the rush nicely.  5th and 6th period were pretty much not blogworthy so Tyke just skips over that part of the day even though Tyke hung out with Purdy and set bball plans with Amed in that span.  As Tyke just mentioned Tyke and Amed finally got their one on one game set and played it at Tyke's house after school.  It was just a beautiful day and the game was played while basking in the warm sunlight.  Simply marvelous.  And so were the results of the games.  Game one started off sloppily for Tyke as he just decided to shoot some 2s.  And the hoop they played at he has never really had good luck shooting 2s on it so he was being pretty stupid to start with.  But he was still missing them.  Amed managed to get off to a quick 6-2 lead.  But that was it.  Tyke went on a 9-0 run and won the game 11-6.  That was a quick game so they played again, same rules.  Tyke just got off to an easy start and just took the game easily.  11-4.  Tyke had now won twice in a row.  So they played again.  Yeah, no problem for Tyke.  He won 11-6 again.  And Tyke was just continually blocking Amed's shots down low.  He couldn't post up on Tyke at all.  Game 4 brought a change.  Tyke was a little tired so from the beginning he just shot 2s but was missing them and couldn't get a good shot off.  And Amed did a good job of getting the rebounds so Amed managed to hold on for his first win, 11-8.  Tyke could have won, probably should have won, but Amed did play pretty well and Tyke wasn't really going after blocks as much.  They played one final game and this one was a blowout.  Tyke won 11-0 and had 6 blocks.  He totaled up a 52-27 overall win and had 16 blocks (more than 3 per game).  Basically, Tyke won.  Amed lost.  But he put up a good fight.  Afterwards Tyke ate a little and watched a little TV before settling down to more ESPN.  Tyke's baller is quite good now.  And his 'Nics franchise is undefeated so far as well.  Tyke had a nice sub for dinner and has one he can have for lunch tomorrow too, so maybe he will bring that in and eat that.  And then he could get the free 6" at Subway to go along with it.  Yes, this is going to look good.  Tyke calls card!  Yep, first to call it.  Oh yeah, and Tyke didn't do any of his homework of course.  So don't bother to ask him.  Ok, another day is gone.  The countdown is getting pretty dang low.  That's weird.  Tyke can't get no...good vibrations.
