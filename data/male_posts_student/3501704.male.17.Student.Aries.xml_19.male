The lyrics are perfect for cheering up those with troubles in relationships, although i am single, it could come in handy in the future...XD  Mircacle by Cascada  Boy meets girl  You were my dream, my world  But I was blind  You cheated on me from behind   So on my own  I feel so all alone  Though I know it’s true  I’m still in love with you    Refrain:   I need a miracle  I wanna be your girl  Give me a chance to see  That you are made for me  I need a miracle  Please let me be your girl  One day you’ll see it can happen to me  I need a miracle  I wanna be your girl  Give me a chance to see  That you are made for me  I need a miracle  Please let me be your girl  One day you’ll see it can happen to me  It can happen to me    Day and night  I’m always by your side  Cause I know for sure  My love is real my feelings pure  So take a try  No need to ask me why  Cause I know its true  I’m still in love with you   I need a miracle…
