GABAY Erya this Saturday...  Service Hours to be done...  pcb layout for ECE 21 for Tuesday...  shit! a lot (or rather a TON) of stuff to do...  yet I can't manage to cram reviewing in math...  everytime I arrive home I feel so battered...I just have to pick up a book ang lie down in bed...and then, uncontrollably, I fall asleep...  I wake up at 3 am next morning do stuff that really needs to be done and take a bath by 5 am and leave home by 6 am...  Go to school, pass stuff, speak up in class, try to do lib work, play cards, eat, tell stories...in short...be unproductive...  Shit! I need to get on...I have to gain the momentum I had at first...plus I haven't had any major subjects yet...I have to this...  I must...so I have to stop this and grab myself and try to solve review questions in Math...  so there...  --logged out--
