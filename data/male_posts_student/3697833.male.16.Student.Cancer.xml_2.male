I've found myself hiding this memorable keepsakes so that they would not be mistaken for trash and be thrown away.  Why do mere objects mean so much to us?  As long as we keep the memories inside, what is the point of haveing such usless junk around.  However, these things hold our memories as well and to us, they should be well preserved because maybe they hold some secret or memory that we what to keep to ourselves.  It reminds me of the quote, "One man's trash is another man's treasure."
