I'd gone to order the AVW today (2:30-3:30), but then Mum told me, "You'll have to pay for your lunch tomorrow - YOUR MONEY." Shit. I got nothing... still I have to pay the remaing 159 for that bus! Things just couldn't get worser... [  Sign...what is money?...People live, struggle, die for it......not even me, not even my family.  ]
