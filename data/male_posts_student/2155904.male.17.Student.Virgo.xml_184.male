Today, the Sanders/Senyohl gang of Tyke, Dotti, Amed, MormoMan, and HeadRed (thanks Amed) decided they would skip English and go out to lunch for a really long time.  So they got a note saying they were working on the Senior Assembly and got that taken care of with the attendance office.  Then they all got in Tyke's car and they went to good old Red Robin.  They were pretty much the only patrons there and they went outside and got a nice table in the sun.  They talked about the whole spectrum of topics and the food was exquisite.  However, they kept on chatting and chatting and forgot that they had to leave.  So Tyke raced them to school but they still got back like 3-5 minutes late.  Which is ironic because they had all of 4th period and their normal lunch with which to use and they still went overboard.  It was something different and fun though.  After school Tyke came home and then changed for bball at Amed's house with him and Willy and DUI's bro.  It was a rousing, spirited hobnobbing affair.  And of course Tyke was topless.  After all of that glory Tyke came home and got cracking on his soliloquy.  He still doesn't actually have it all memorized and he kinda has to go tomorrow but he thinks he can do it under the pressure.  He needs to at least do well on it because of his whole, ya know, grade thing.  But after he did that work and took out the trash Tyke went to the Friends party.  He was initially told it was at Mandy's but apparently that got changed without Tyke getting notified.  So yeah, Tyke got up there and thought he was a little early so he drove around cuz it was nice out and he just filled up on gas so he drove over right past Kinker's house but he wasn't outside so Tyke then turned around and went back to Mandy's.  He still didn't see anyone there so he called Dotti and she told him it got moved to her house.  So Tyke drove all the way down there and met up with Dotti, Mandy, and Purdy.  Tina came over as well and now it is really good between Tyke and Tina.  It is really fun being around her again.  MormoMan and Fiddlesticks came over a little bit later as well.  Well, the final episode was exactly what it should have been.  It wasn't that emotional except for...hmmm maybe Tyke shouldn't say the part but it involves Ross and crying.  Yeah, that was sad.  Well, Tyke sorta needs to memorize lines.  And he is also a little bit tired.  But hey, it's Friday tomorrow and Tyke already has plans for the night which is always awesome.  Pre-planned plans rule!
