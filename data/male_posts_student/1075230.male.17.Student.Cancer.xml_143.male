I hope you have like 20 minutes to spare... lol, Part 1 of 5:   For the 4 th  time in my life, I was starting at a new school. It was what I've been fighting for for a long while... to go to Ward. I recall in grade 8, when I first had the school selection form. I debated with my parents to go to Ward, but they wouldn't let me, and eventually, when it got late, my dad just took the form from me and checked off Brebeuf... I shed a few tears ^^;; (*cough cough* yes, I realize that's very weak, but I done that since then)    The reason why my parents allowed me to transfer was because the school was relocating. This had promised - earlier - that they wouldn't relocate, and the new school wouldn't affect the old one that much. For awhile, this worked out ok - they provided schoolbuses to Bathurst Heights. However, they had annouced that they would be cancelling the schoolbus service for next year. This set the stage for my new arguments of why to go to Ward: it would take around 4 hours back and forth each day - this would drain energy for school. Not to mention in case of emergencies, I'll be nowhere near home. I found out near the beginning of the school year that they re-introduced the school bus service, and I stupidly told my parents that. They wanted me to transfer back.. and I was like.. "uhhh... no."   The only problem was... most of the original advantages of going to Ward had disappeared. I wouldn't be used to the place - don't know teachers, people, how things work, ... - and well, I don't know... just some advantages disappeared. New uniform for instance (actually i only bought the sweater thingy) Plus I felt like a niner.    I think that it was for the best that I went to Brebeuf for one year. It gave me a fresh slate to start off with. Also, it forced me out of the shell I was in for my elementary school years. This is because I knew like  no one  at Brebeuf, I was forced to make friends. This didn't turn out that bad, made me much less shy, and the result was a much enjoyable time.
