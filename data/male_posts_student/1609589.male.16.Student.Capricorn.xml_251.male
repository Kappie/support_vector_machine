I was forced to run through hundreds of different scenarios of how I could bomb the Campus Techs'(the people who supposedly fix the computers at the school) office, but it was no use- they're not worth the attention.  Those shits(except for Tracy), always surly- something happens to them when they walk through that door to go to their JOB(except for that tamara bitch, i hate her.). Do those people really have to be such bitches all the time?  I walked in this morning to see what can be done about my powercord for my laptop(which got stepped on by some idiot at school), and that tamara whore says "Damn, they all come in at once!"  I said "My powercord is busted right here," as i pointed to where the damage was and handed it to her.   She decided that my complete knowledge of what the problem was unimportant, so she inspects the thing on her own, shoves it within 3 inches of my face and barks "Physical damage."  I stood there, wondering if she had heard me, and I said "Yeah, that's kind of what I came in here for..."  She said "You'll have to pay for it."  "You don't... have soldering irons?"  "Go up to the cashier on the third floor."  "How much is it?"  "I don't know, she's on the 3rd floor."  As I turned around to exit, one of the other people working there says "Sorry about your powercord!" and I turned back and said "I'm sure you are." and stormed the hell up the stairs.  Yay, the cashier wasn't there! She for some reason thought that her job was something OTHER than punching numbers, and had an "appointment" until 10:00!  A friend later told me it was gonna be 42 bucks. Fuck that, my dad and I just fixed it ourselves. We can actually DO things. I'm not worried about it "revoking" the insurance on the powercord, because IT WAS ALREADY FUCKING BROKEN!  Then, at home, the reality sets in that one of my really REALLY good friends is going to California, and I may never see him again after this year. All good things must come to an end, I suppose.  ...  The only good news for today is that I was able to  get some brainstorming done on both my Flash website in progress, and the Blue man party. I'm trying to have one at my house in April/May(although it's looking like May because of conflicting schedules). It shall be fun.  Also, sorry about not posting- absolutely nothing has happened in the past couple days that deserves use of my attention.  Also, 2 notes to whoever shops at Hot Topic:  1. Abercrombie OWNS hot topic! Literally! They're the same company!! 2. You whores would not last 2 seconds in anarchy.  That is all.
