Of course i said no because he wasn't. Wow is my life screwed up even though it might not look like it outside the house of dumbasses. I SWEAR they fight once a month or once every two months. Plus its pointless because usually it's my mom who thinks my dad is looking at another woman. I reeeeally doubt that he has or she has caught him in my eyes i think she does it on purpose for some strange and assholeish reason. I'm again listening to avril lavigne's new cd which rox but my mom told me to close the door even though ITS NOT LOUD  but it is now  ;):p just to annoy them and block them out of my life for 40 minutes or until my brother comes home probably wasted. I don't know what a drunk person smells like because i of course don't smell my brother because he would beat me up or just yell at me or give me a "what the fuck is wrong with you" look(he's 20). I just wish the fighting would stop and they actually talk about it without my dad being pushed away from my mom who acts like a bitch when she's a bitch(don't worry if the last few words didn't make sense):p. Tomorrow or the rest of tonight better get better or i will be soo mad i won't give a FUCK what they say or do. Bye for now!
