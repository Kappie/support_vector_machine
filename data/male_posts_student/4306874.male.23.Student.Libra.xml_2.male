What an interesting little film. 7 people are thrown into a huge structure, a cube, made up of smaller cubicles, each the size of a small room. Some are booby-trapped, some are not. This group of complete strangers must pool their skills to try and find a way out.  You know, it's great to know that while shit like "King Arthur" and "Catwoman" is hurled from Hollywood, there's still inteligent people out there related to the movie industry. Except most of them are not in the U.S. anymore.  Case in point: horror. Hollywood has forgotten how to make horror. While stupid shit like "Scream 15" and "Freddy VS Jason" is being made, the brits give us jewels like "28 Days Later", "Dog Soldiers", "Deathwatch" and "The Bunker", the japanese give us more "The Ring" trilogy(forget the terrible american remake) and "The Eye", and even the spanish are in the loop.  And judging as to how there's only remakes coming out of Hollywood, I say let the US movie industry drown itslef on its own shit. The rest of the world has not forgotten how to make quality cinema.  And above all, not forgotten that horror films are about scares and tension, not about blood and naked teen chicks.
