The band is a side project, with John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on guitar, Joe Lally of Fugazi on bass, and Josh Klinghoffer of Bicycle Thief of drums. A very intriguing album--it was recorded all in the span of, I believe, two days (of four days of recording--the rest of the music will be released on a future album, this was really 1/2 of an album). The album basically consists of jams with vocals added over them, and just like Frusciante's last solo album, "The Will To Death", the whole album was (obviously) recorded very quickly. What's so cool about this album is how long the songs are--it's a 45 minute long full album with a whole 5 songs, you do the math! lol...and not one bad song in the mix, either. It might not be the easiest album to find, but if you can pick it up (most major music stores should have it), make sure to do so! What an album...  Frusciante, in case you didn't know, is currently on an album tear. He released a solo album, "Shadows Collide With People", back in February (recorded in 2002). Shortly before its release, he recorded another album, "The Will To Death" (released in June) and this album about a month later (this album with the band Ataxia). He recorded a new album every month for the next four months. So now, the six albums are to be released as part of a series, this new release being the second in the series. What a guy! Seven albums in one year (because "Shadows" wasn't part of the series of six), can it get much better?  Oh, and the albums are amazing nonetheless :) He took care to record each album as quickly as possible, usually in only a take or two, and welcomed mistakes into the recording, integrating them into the music. Great stuff, pick these discs up!  Speaking of unique recording methods, I just found this out from a  urlLink review of Ottmar's "La Semana" : OL "would employ a delay function that would take the track back 16 barsâ€”enough time for him to run over to the studio room and get his headphones on." Wow....
