You saw my morning stuff in my  urlLink old journal . This afternoon, I went to the post office, but unknowingly I got into a whole errand run also to the OfficeMax and the Meijer. At least when we got back, dinner was ready.  I can't believe that the summer's almost over! School starts August 30, and Drivers Ed. August 16 (woot!) I get my permit Sept 3rd or something like that, and my license March 3rd!  Not much else now, I'll keep this updated!  ~josh
