It wasn't that bad, at least we found something to do most of the time even if it was just walking up to town or something like that. We almost ended up walking out to my house just for something to do but his dad wouldn't let us! GRRR! *smacks Dale* lol  Today we (parents and I) went to my uncle's resturaunt in Niles, he always hooks us up there. He cooked up like 5 appetizers that were already on the table when we got there, he said it was on him so that's cool. I ended up getting a chicken salad since I wasn't really THAT hungry I just wanted more of a sanck I don't know. Well anyway we went back into the kitchen to see my Uncle and one of the cooks there was really hot and he kept like staring at me then my Uncle introduced me to him, his name was Justin. Then me and him just started talking and he hit on me, he's like nice eyes! I just said thanks and said his were nice too, so yeah that was kind of weird to have that happen. After that we left, damn I should've gotten his phone number! Oh well, he probably isn't worth my time like alot of other guys but there's a few good ones out there *cough*brian*cough*! lol So yeah, today was extremely boring as to be expected but you know what? WARPED TOUR IS NEXT SATURDAY!  I'm like so hyper about it, it's going to be so awesome when we go, I can't wait to meet Simple Plan. Oh and this week.... MALL! Maybe anyway, I have to work it out with a few people...
