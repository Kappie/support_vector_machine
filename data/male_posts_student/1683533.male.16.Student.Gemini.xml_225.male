The first band was decent (called Vegas, from Ohio), but the vox sounded like a mix of New Found Glory and Dashboard. 9miles2go was good as usual. What they played first was the intro to  "Hey"  by  The Suicide Machines,  then instead of going into the ska part, they switched to one of their songs, which was pretty neat. Afterwards, aimee and heather left then this goth kid kept looking at me so I asked "what?" and he asked who was the girl i was talking to with the black tank top (Heather), cause his friend had the hots for her. Then his friend said "No that wasnt me, he's the one that likes her!" So it was awesomly mature, as you can see....  So, I finally got ahold of the actual copy of Fill In The Blanks by 9M2G, I had the test copy but they never sent me the real one.  My cousin said his other band was having a sweet show on the 21st with  Before I Go  and  Alucard  (I really miss Alucard, they could really bring the mosh, same goes for Before I Go) and some others at a Knights of Colombus. I really like the local hall shows at the Knights of Colombus, a suprising amount of people show up for the bands maybe 100 or more...and it is really fun, cause you encounter alot of new bands as well. But yea, I'm gonna go to that.  That's all for now.
