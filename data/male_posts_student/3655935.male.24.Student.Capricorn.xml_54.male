All I can ask is that you pray for me.  Sometimes things get so complicated.  I am at a total loss right now, which is an unusual feeling for me.  Sometimes I think I'd rather be wrong and resolved than undecided.  Aaarrrggghh!!!  ...pray for me...   [This is the end of the post, so there's no need to click on the link below.]
