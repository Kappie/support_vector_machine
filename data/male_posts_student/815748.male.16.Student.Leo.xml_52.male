I was wary of the method when I began school, but so far it's working nicely.  Richie, Ian, and I (no comment from Matt Woolf) are miffed at our Chemistry teacher, Ms. Srikanth.  She's a good teacher and all, but she changed her mind like five times about whether or not to round sig figs before cutting off the insignificant figs.  Now she says we heard her wrong the last time every time she changes her story.  To quote Strong Sad, "This is getting frustrating.  I'm getting really frustrated."  Model UN starts tomorrow.  I'm not sure when I'm going to get a country, but since I know I'm getting a selected one, it might be then.  I erred last post, saying that last week was season premiere week.  This coming week is.  The only premiere of last week was of Boston Public, but this week (and I'm sure this time), the Laws and Orders, West Wing, ER, etc. will premiere.  Sorry, y'all (not like any of you watch NBC anyway, though it's a much better network than the War channel or any of those other cable channels).  Several new quotes have been said this week:  "Everyone should be in their own lockers," –Mr. Aronson  "If someone tells you to do something, do it," –Mr. Aronson  "Potassium nitrate is classified as explosive, so you should always put it in flammable containers," –Ms. Srikanth  "If I heard the mare correctly..." –Ms. Heidlage  "If they had another block, I'd take six science courses instead of five!" –Ms. Heidlage, imitating a REALLY driven student
