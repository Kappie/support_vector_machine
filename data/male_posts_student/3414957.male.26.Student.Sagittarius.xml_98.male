I had 2 test and I think I did ok on them both...hopefully. Work was weird. Some guy was talking about legalizing pot and of course that got everyone talking becasue most of the people are recovering addicts. Man I was pissed that this guy brought up this subjuect in front of these guys, so I left the room and went to the server room for a bit. I worked on the VA kiosk project for a few hours, then did some internet research for some English homework. I finally got paid today from the GI Bill. Danm they take forever and I even have direct deposit!  I just finished posting new poems on my website. About 4 or 5 of them towards the bottom with blue arrows next to them. Sometimes when I get down and feel blue, I just start to write exactley how I feel. Well sometimes not ewxactley because then I would ahve to say I am tired of life and can't wait for something better. I am listening to Phil Hendrie right now and at least I am happy when I listen to him. He cracks me up. Also what is really funny is all the stupid people in the world tha tcall up his show and debate his "guests".     urlLink Here is my poetry page
