After I was done my ice cream (i eat it slow, she was waiting on me), we went to a play at the college. It was an interesting play. I'm sure it'd be better if I understood it, maybe I'll look it up on the internet tonight and see. After the play, we went to Tim Horton's. I love that place, so many memories. She has an idea for a grad dress, and I really like the idea. It's really...her. Afterwards, we went to Superstore so she could pick up some stuff for a school project. We talked to Paul. I seen Shawna. They all have to wear ugly red shirts. On our way back to the car, she kissed me, and it was a great feeling. I got that feeling, the one when you kiss someone for the first time. Butterflies, heart skips a beat. It was great, like our first kiss all over again. It was a great feeling. We went to see "One Hour Photo". It's a decent movie. I was sitting with my slush on my chest...kinda holding it there, and I was slouched over. Anyway, there was a hole in the bottom of the cup, and it leaked red stuff all over one of my good shirts. I was mad. I soaked it in cold water and my mom said she would try and get it out today. I haven't seen her or the shirt today, so I don't know. After the movie, I took Crystal home. We kissed in my car for a long time. It was the most pure kiss I have ever kissed, where it is just "i love you" with nothing else...no lust, no anger, no "this is fun"...just "i love you". And I do.  urlLink  postCount('nov212002');
