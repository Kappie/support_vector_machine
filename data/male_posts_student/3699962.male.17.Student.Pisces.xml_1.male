       
       Spinning: Kelly Clarkson - Beautiful Disaster*   I refuse to go through my whole mourning phase again. I refuse to choose to walk around with a vacuum instead of a heart. I refuse to be where I was a month ago.  I will lift my head up high. Trample whatever obstacles. And move on.  Life still goes on. And I better get back to the flow of things. I'll start by studying for my common tests. Heh.  (P.s. Economics is just about to frying my brain already.) Sir Germy
