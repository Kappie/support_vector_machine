      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn, the lazy guy who never posts. Service zone sucks, yadayadayada. Anyway, heading to the great lake today for some shootage of my movie, which is tentatively called "Glenn's terrible-ass project where he proves he made the right decision in not attending film school." Ha ha, just kidding. It's called "T.A.P." for short. Looking forward to spending my tax return on pointless crap. And food. I'm going to go eat at Mori (local sushi place) when that republican money starts coming in. Screw social betterment, Imma git me an xbox. Nick is going to see KBV2 with us tonight, whether he likes it or not. If he's broke we'll scrounge the cash, or make him sell his body. I think a Tarantino flick in the theater, even if it is the crappy ass lake city theater, is worth the abandonment of scruples.   So in poetry club last night this girl who was workshopping her poem was almost in tears by the end. I felt bad, but you shouldn't bring in a poem you completely love to be workshopped. You bring it in because you need help with it. I think a lot of people have the attitude that they'll bring in a poem and wow everybody with it and will get the response "Well, I quit writing. This is amazing and needs no work." Hell, even I used to bring in poems based on that thought. Now I realize a poem is done when the writer thinks it's done, so don't bring in that poem to get workshopped. Bring in a poem you don't like so much, or have trouble with. People can always critique anything, so leave the stuff you don't want critiqued at home. She's a good writer, but some people don't respond well to criticism.   My new musical collaborator and I started working on our music. Sounds pretty good so far. I listend to "Nice Ass" by Free Kitten and loved the sloppy sound. I think that's what I want. Anyway, I gotsta get going to Psycho class.  In health news, I feel fine. - Kevin Nealon
