And to think now, 8 years later, in 2004, I'm sitting in the pews today listening to one of my fellow HYPE members Stephanie Chan, giving her testimony and anointed with the Holy Water, representing her full affirmation of Accept Jesus Christ. Yeah it was a pretty cool and touching sight. I mean as she was being baptized, even I was thinking:  "Wow.....to think we were all little 7 year olds trying to memorize Words of Faith for gifts and prizes. Now, we try to remember Words of Faith to bring others to Christ and gain Spiritual gifts and prizes, and to fight off the temptations of Satan."  Ok that is a little bit more fancy wording, but it was basically around the area of that =P. Another thought that popped up I guess *as of every other baptism I've attended* I started to wonder "when will it be my time?" Only God can tell =).  Well this happy day started off with my usual morning awakening to another sunny day. Hmm....weird I woke up at 830.......WTH 730?! Ugh stupid clock fooling me.....er eyes. So yeah slept for another hour. False alarm hehe =P.  *1 Hour later*  OK NOW IT'S ACTUALLY 830 *unlike that stupid fake 830 an hour ago* and now I'm alive and about. Walked downstairs, ate, got dressed, usual hygiene morning routine....and WOOSH! I'm out the door! Went to pick up Lina for her first day at LCAC *wonder if she liked it* and then off to pick up Jason also. Then usual 5 min drive from Jason's to the church.  Hmm......got there pretty early today. Mike, Dan and mom came today which was nice to see. Really hope those two dudes can bring their whole family one day....got real big hopes on em hahaha *pressure's ondudes.* Jokes jokes. So headed upstairs......was pretty cool seein' Gavin leading worship. Yeah and Ali Austin and Chris were also up there today. Hmmm....thinkin' about it bummer.....this is gonna be Ali's 3rd last time leading worship? Graduatin' so yeah I think it's either 3rd or 4th last time. 5th maybe? There's my math skills for you hehe. Ushered for a bit before Brian finally got there, and Wendy took my spot in place of Gloria. And then service started.  Today started off like usual....opening prayer and then songs of praise. Afterwards though.....Steph said her testimonial. Hmm......if I'm not wrong is she the first English testimonial person? Even if not that, she's the first HYPEr to be testifying before baptism hehe. It was actually a very touching story.....I won't say anything though as I don't know if she would want me to post it up on MY blog. It is her story....so I'll let her tell it =P. So listened to her story, and then afterwards Pastor D went on with his sermon after Carmen read Scripture. Today's story: Easter story....er actually more of the story of what HYPE studied last night: how we benefited from Christ dying and rising from the tomb in 3 days. It was actually pretty interesting what he had to say though...  Before that though......ouch much bashing on the dentist kids @ UWO in LCAC today hahaha.  "Yup......though there is much suffering and pain in this world....to think one day all of it will be gone, and I'll be in heaven, way from war, pain, suffering, sadness.....and dentists."   Dentists not needed in heaven? Jokes haha....but yeah still just the moment when he said it lol.....everyone just turns to Jesse and laughs *Jesse slowly hides behind church bulletin.*  Pastor D was saying how obviously many of us in this world will say "how did we benefit? What changed? I mean, there's still pain, suffering, sorrow, etc." But when you think about it.....and it even shows in Bible..Christ gave us the boldness and courage to go out and preach to the world about the wonders that God has done for us. Before Christ died, the Apostles were even kinda shaky about the Faith, and even fled when Jesus was arrested. However, after Christ rose, they would die, and even be crucified just to stand up for Christ. So yeah changes and benefits did come, but sometimes we are just too blind to see it. So yeah just a bit of a heads up for me even I guess.....I mean it's always good to have reminders like that so we won't be led astray.  After the service *which Lina said actually wasn't that bad* we headed downstairs for refreshments. OH YEAH CALVIN'S NOW OFFICIALLY REFRESHMENTS CO-ORDINATOR HAHAHA. CONGRATS MAN lol. Actually it's cool seein' us all gettin' more involved in church.....it's a start.......funny one but it is a job hehe. Cookies were good though so good start Calvin haha. So chatted, ate, you know usual stuff and then headed to class.  Yes class today....HILARIOUS lol. We wrote stories....er more of news articles of what news might have been back then when Christ rose. This was me and Josh's interpretation:   THE WOMEN WHO CRIED RISEN!  The Good Book said He would rise in three days. And right it was. Early this morning, local prostitute turned Catapult Dynamics Enginner Dr. Mary Magdeline was going to pay her respects to Jesus, a recently crucified carpenter/teacher when she found the tomb opened. The 54 ton rock guarding the carven tomb was rolled away. "I was surprised to see that the guards were not there. With my knowledge of wedge-tool dynamics, I concluded that no wedge-tool could have removed a rock of that magnitude with such magnitude! It was inconceivable!" She also reported that she and friend Mary "Mother of James" Smith encountered an angel at the tomb. The angel told them to "Go out and tell the others" that Jesus had risen. On their hasty way, Jesus apparently appeared to them. Smith tells us: "Dude! It was totally rad. Like, Jesus totally rose from the dead. He was right there and we fell down and praised Him! We got to touch his feet too! It was totally far out." Rumour has it that over 500 people have also seen the risen Jesus. However, that remains to be proven and this reporter, for one, will not report the senseless chatter of blabbering midwives. This is Jahoravich DingleShmienz reporting for the National Inquirer."   You like? Haha Hope you did took me 3 minutes to type *OH NO!* So after that fun filled class we headed upstairs to watch Steph's baptismal, and of course the others. Heh Josh got the video and I got the pics. Argh stupid recharge time....only got 3 pics lol. Well s'all good.....the point is I'll remember it....since she is the first HYPE kid to be baptized. Once again....many congrats Steph =P. So after the baptism headed back downstairs for some chattin', and pictures w/ Steph. Yeah she got flowers, gifts, you know.......cool stuff hahaha. And yeah picture taking was funny lol. I had to head out early though.....had to go home and help chop down Mr. Tree in my backyard....the one that's been back there for....well as long as I've been around hehe. Since I was born lol...well right when we moved in so 13 years. yeah big old tree. Never noticed it till today lol.  So got home....ate.....Jason came over for a bit too....was on compy while I chopped down tree. STUPID TREE SAP.....ugh so friggin' sticky. It's like glue...but smells like crap and probably tastes like it too lol. So did that quickly then headed down for some games of NBA street and NFL street. WOW lots of wasted time.....BUT WHO CARES POINT IS IT WAS FUN =P. So did that until Jason had to leave....and then drummed for an hour, then ate, and then......  And then........PLANNING FOR TOMORROW WHICH WAS UTTER FAILURE. Though my day didn't end off too well......I am always seeming to be on optimistic side.....and well yeah I looked on bright side here too. I mean though Josh can't make it to the planning tomorrow nor Rebecca, me Gavin and maybe Carmen will still push ahead and try to come up with as much as we can. Well we still got a few days so no worries hehe. Praise night ain't till Sunday anyways. Well after thinking more.....isn't that bad I guess. I mean...who knows....God could be doing this for a reason. I mean............predestination.....it exists. Everything's planned. So yeah there is definitely a reason why Josh can't make it tomorrow.....and I'll leave it be for Christ to reaveal to me how it was for the best hehe.  Anyways....yeah I'm out for the night. Gotta wake up, do theory, read, finish math, then head to Gavin's tomorrow early hehe. Later boy's n' girls =P.  OH YES HOW COULD I ALMOST FORGET..........MAISIE MAD PROPS FOR HELPIN' ME WITH MATH TODAY Lol. Thanks a bunch =).
