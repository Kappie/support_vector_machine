I even pick up smoking le... Im not addicted though... Talking about 2 days ago...  Me, Christ, Xinhui, Wenfong and Wanxin we all went to the airport and eat together... F Bu 5 de reunion... Since I already left the Palsm foodcourt of course I look forward to the gathering... The rest of them are still working there... Christ quitting on the 20 of June while the others are quiting on the 19... I was shock that Christ is quitting... I did ask her why she quit but she just told me that later she will then tell me but she never... Shouldnt have given so much pressure on her bahz... She changed alot... From last time very innocent to now... But she is still as warm as like in the past... :)  Anyway, we went to Sakae Sushi to have our lunch lorhz... I was late as like always... Im known for being late nowadays... I dont know when I pick up this habit of being late... lolx... Was actually so fun but Xinhui didnt quite enjoy cuz she didnt like sushi de... And the whole 2 hours we were like eating and playing but she just sat there... Listening to her discman and playing with her handphone... We forgotten that she dont like to eat sushi but she still come when we ask her too... Seems like she didnt want to be a spoilsport lorhz... Xinhui is a nice girl... Then hor after that, we didnt know where to go to... Then I think Wanxin brought up the idea of cycling so we went to Eunos and took a taxi to East Coast... turn out that we have to actually hired 2 taxi because of the number of passenger allowed in a taxi... Haha... What the hell... went to East Coast then Christ suddenly told us that Daddy and Jean will be coming down for drinking... Jean was mad at Christ for not calling her when she awake cuz the day before, Jean told Christ to do so... Everyone try to call Jean but she didnt pick up the phone... She is quite petty de... Christina cried again... See liaoz me also no mood to cycle... Then Daddy called her she also never pick up the phone...  Thus everyone keep calling her... She finally took Christ's call...  Christ cried while on the phone... Then Xinhui took the phone and speak to Jean cuz Jean is her Mummy... Then me Wanxin and Wenfong went to sit at the rock on the beach... We were later joined by Christ and Xinhui after Jean promised to come to East Coast...   The scenery was so nice and we sit by the sea and chat lorhz... Then Wanxin's friend sms her to invite her to some birthday party but because due to her working, she couldnt make it and she was so stressed... She have some problems with her friends now cuz all of them told her that she changed alot and have neglected all her friend yi da tui... But no lorhz... Wanxin never changed... This kind of attitude from her friend is starting to depress Wanxin now... Then hao call bu call, her father called her... Wanxin reject the phone call and cried... Very jia lat de... All cry de... Some personnal reason bahz... Then what happen liaoz... My mind so blur le..   I remember that Jean came and then Christ and Xinhui went to drink with Daddy and Jean... Left me Wanxin and Wenfong... We sit down and chat for a bit before walking... Wenfong have to go to Sparks cuz of some birthday celebration so me and Wanxin take her to find bus lorhz... Wenfong then told us about some problems she faced... Looks like almost everyone have problems of their won...   Was back at East Coast at around 8+. We meet up with Christ and Xinhui... Went to cycle till aound 10+ The place was so nice at East Coast... Night cycling is so fun... We settle down at one of the pier at the end of the cycling track... We stayed there to watch the sky...   Dont know why... My tears flow... I also want my ex to be with me de... Hiaz... Wipe my tear and we all cycle back...  Jean and Daddy was still there... We join them for drinking... I dont know why but I went drinking also... Xinhui offered me a puff and I did smoke... The brand of the cigarretee remind me of my ex...   I drink until Im dead drunk... I dont want to think of what hapen liao after Im drunk... I hurt Christ and Jean bleed because of me... Wanxin lost her wallet also during that day... Christ cried again... Wanxin Wenfong and Christ sent me home... I reach home and fall asleep... I did called my ex... He seems very irritated with me... He didnt call me liaoz...  Fuck the whole world for being so dark...  Signing off - Ronald
