I originally thought she was named after Rosebud in  Citizen Kane , but it turned out that my sister named her Rosebud after all the rose buds that were blooming when we first got her.   Rosebud is an old cat, about 12 years old, making her equivalent to about a 70 year old human. She was a gift from my dad's coworker, Dado Vrasolovic, who had an unspayed cat. Rosebud is the last of her family to survive; her mother and siblings got run over by cars, poisoned by neighbours,    When I first met Rosebud, when I was four or five, I liked to throw her into our swimming pool. It was a lot of fun, and she started to really dislike me. We're okay now, though; I fed her for a while so she started thinking better of me. I feel kind of bad now for throwing her into the pool so much but I still sort of smile when I think about it. We don't have a pool any more.   urlLink    Note: this photo is slightly different from the higher up one. I just put it here to break up the text some; 400 words needs at least two photos.  When we first got her she was a white cat with pink ears. Now she doesn't have ears anymore but her fur is still white. No, the ears didn't fall off; they got cancer, so a couple years ago my sister took her to the vet and got the ears removed in an elaborate operation to the tune of $1300. I thought it was kind of a waste of money but I suppose it made my sister happy (she  has a lot of money to spend on stuff like this), so it all worked out all right. Rosebud catches mice too, which is kind of nice, though she sometimes leaves half eaten mouse carcasses in various places.  So in conclusion you shouldn't get a white cat with pink ears and make her stay outside because she'll get ear cancer and you'll have to pay $1300 to cure her, even if she is a good mouser. And if you do get a cat don't throw her into your swimming pool or she'll dislike you for a long time, though eventually she'll learn to love you if you feed her for a while.   I should learn how to paint watercolour. It seems pretty cool.   urlLink
