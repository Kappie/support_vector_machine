Of course, this piece, being MSNBC, is tainted with assumptions rather than analysis.  These jobs are going, we can't hang on to them without barriers and artificial controls, which will just make things worse.  As individuals, we need to learn these lessons.  We are each a vital part of our own success.  We each need to always be prepared to do something different.  If you aren't learning a new skill, or prepared to face the possibility of chaning jobs, then you are setting yourself up for pain.  There are no gaurentees of an easy life.  We all must be ready to ride the wave and figure out how to survive.  This is not a failing of our country.  On the contrary, the ability to change is one of the strengths of this country.
