After a hard day's work, I was already tired by the time I got there like a few other people, but partied into the early hours of the morning and thoroughly enjoyed it.    I woke up at about 7.30 this morning, aching all over from sleeping on a sofa and went home at about 10. I had a shower, got dressed and played around with my new camera for a while, then had some lunch. This afternoon some friends came over for a barbeque while the weather behaved itself. I also bought the following songs on iTunes:     I Want You Back - Jackson 5 Let's Get It Started - Black Eyed Peas Ride - The Vines Tomorrow I'm off to London on a geography field trip, and will be taking my camera as it should provide more exciting photo oppurtunities than my back garden can. Now off to bed, for tomorrow is bound to be tiring enough as it is.
