"Chinese Dance is the Number ONE CCA in Riverside.." haha.. wow..? surprise huh.. no.. it isn't.. this "number one" was earned by our hardworking seniors.. yes.. and it's my job to keep on carry the name so as to remain in number one..    after the practise.. ha.. my face is shiny.. my arms are shiny.. my legs are shiny.. and you know what.. it's all sweat.. wadde hell.. -.- and my hair was wet and i look like sadako with cut hair.. zZz..      was walking home alone after the practise.. suddenly i thought of something.. "I control no one.. And no one can ever control me" .. ya.. it's a motto of my own.. and i'm still wondering why i suddenly thought of that.. well.. maybe it's because i saw a little boy playing remote control car in the middle of the road.. haha.. oh my god.. why do sentences like this keep poping out of my mind..      after i had finished my tuition.. hey.. i receive a very heart warming message from a girl.. hmm.. a girl whom i've just made friend with.. well.. come on.. just a message.. it could mean nothing.. so don't get jealous huh.. haha.. =P
