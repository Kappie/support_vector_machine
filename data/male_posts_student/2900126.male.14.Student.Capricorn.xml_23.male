But the thing is Kiara keep on being a stubborn little person and she calls me all these names like fag and all that other crap and that started because of a joke and she turned it into a rumor. And the whole 8th grade thought i was bisexual and i had to put up with that crap. Then she kept tyhe rumor going by calling me a fag/homo/homochuck and all that stuff. I asked her nicely( over the net)to stop calling me those names because they really irritate me or to at least just substitute those names with something else. ALL she had to say about that was "no" and " leave me alone" and after she said leave me alone I just left.I really tried to make this work i was always nice to her and I tried to comfort her in every way possible. Then I pray (to god) every night that all of my family and friends would stay together and everybody would be happy. But I guess this friend is not a friend anymore because I tried my hardest to make it work and she just doesn't want to budge. Sometimes I wish that i could just start life over from a certain point and then fast forward it again to see the outcome and if it's not right i could do it all over again and again. But that will never happen.    I just wish that she can change her ways and we could make this work out. But everthing happens for a reason and everbody has a differrent personality so you can't always keep the friends that you want if it's not meant to be.
