Bulgaria played a consistent first half with some good chances to score but a bad offside trap allowed Sweden to take the lead. The second half started with a few really good opportunities for the Bulgarians to equalize.  But then Henrik Larsson showed why he is regarded as a top scorer. A beautiful header and a yet another goal a minute later took Sweden to a three-nil lead. The rest is more or less history, Bulgaria gave up the game and Sweden managed to score two more goals.  My Man of the Match: Henrik Larsson.
