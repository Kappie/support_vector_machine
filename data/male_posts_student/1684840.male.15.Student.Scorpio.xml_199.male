I love reading back in my blog there is so much I have forgotten already.  The interest I have when reading past posts in my blog will never cease and will be really cool when I'm old and I can look back (if the Internet as we know it exists in the future) and read it and be amazed.  Today was boring.  We were back in normal 'lessons' but we didn't do much.  I was taken home after Games because my pulse had rocketed above 100 and I had done nothing purposely because I had no inhalers with me!  Weird or what...
