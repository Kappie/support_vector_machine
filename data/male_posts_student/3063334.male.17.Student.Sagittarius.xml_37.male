Bush To Iraqi Militants: 'Please Stop Bringing It On'  WASHINGTON, DCâ€”In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. "Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.  Props to the Onion for that little piece. My two cents on the AP test?    AHHHHH. Now, were did all those grammar/rhetorical thingy lists go to?  --Beck--
