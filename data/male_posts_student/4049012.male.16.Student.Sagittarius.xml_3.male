School starts on August 10th, so I'm gonna be fucked if I don't start working on it now. But, anyway, things have been slow here, as usual. The usual torrent of DNC material is coming at full speed, of course, and I have to rant to fend it off. Kerry's just like Clinton, really. He can stand up there and make all the little promises he wants; I just want to see them materialize. Hell, at this point, we're obviously being forced to pick the lesser of two evils, which is obviously John Kerry. I'm not a slimy democrat, and I'm not a fat swine of a Republican, but eh, Kerry is the only alternative.  In the four years Bush has "run" this country, what has he done? Made some tax cuts. Woo. Started a war. Bigger woo. It's not really the fact that I hate the man as much as it is that he's done nothing for us. Nothing. And the only defense pro-Bush morons have is the "war on terrorism". Um, yes. Depleting the national treasury in a 3rd world country. And as if it's even a fair fight. So far, the only reason Americans have been killed is rogue Iraqis with mortars and metal objects. No weapons of mass destruction...no nuclear plan...not shit. Just a nation of people we've managed to piss off even further.   So, yeah, vote for Bush again this November. Come on, I dare ya. See where it gets you.   Anyway...I'm going to sleep. Adios.
