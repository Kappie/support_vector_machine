First we find out that Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has a  urlLink 65% approval rating , and today the California Supreme Court annulled more than  urlLink 4,000 gay marriages  in San Francisco, saying that the city government improperly granted the marriage licenses for the homosexuals. Hopefully this trend will continue, and California will throw out Nancy Pelosi in November. Now THAT would be a victory.
