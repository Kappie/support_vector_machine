"single...n' crushin hard."  thats what caught my attention.  that is so true right now in my life.  lol.  it really is.  sad?  yep.  but whatever.  life goes on.  i've always found that to be quite dependable.  no matter what happens.  life always keeps going.  it doesnt slow down so you can keep up.  it just keeps going and going.  i guess that can be a bad thing but i always think its a good thing.  life keeps ya on your toes.  yep.  sho does.  well yeah.  im single and im crushin' hard.  and now im gone.  au revoir!
