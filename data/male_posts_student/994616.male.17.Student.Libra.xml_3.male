I broke my dicman. it's times like these i wished i had an iPor,. or atleast a discman that wasnt crappy ie made by sony.  I saw   The Italian Job  tonight. Review:  The basic plot line was good. There wasn't enough character development. There was just enough for you to know that this personj loved that person etcetera. The revenge stuff wasn't that strong either.   the acting was average. the comic parts could have been delivered better too.  im pretty tired, so i think i will finish this review up with 2 monkeys out of 5  g'night
