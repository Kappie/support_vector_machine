NOTHING AT ALL. some case examples would be:  -liz and everything that's going on in her life. that lazy kid i know has a job now! what the hell is happening. -tom used to be an easygoing, fun loving guy. seems like he's going through some bad times and i have no clue how to help him out... mitch was going through something similar but i think that's all passed.  -my relationship with amber is constantly evolving and getting stronger. 2 months ago i was just saying hello to the girl. it's been about a month from today that we've been dating. i haven't felt anything nearly this way about anyone ever.   ... and that's just how i see it.
