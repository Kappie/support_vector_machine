If you are a blogger on www.blogger.com you should give it a try. Its very easy to use.  CALLING ALL SHUTTERBUGS  I'm still using an old Sony Cybershot 1.3MP digital camera.  Do you have any suggestions for a new one?  I'm looking for a 3+MP camera for under $300.  If anyone has a suggestion for a new post or review please email me at macspotblog@yahoo.com  ~MacMan~
