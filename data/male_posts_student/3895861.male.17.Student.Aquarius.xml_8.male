It is where you ask serious questions (or stupid ones), and get stupid answers. It is fun. There are also little games here and there, that ppl make up, that go inthe forum. There is one where you have to come up with a band name starting with the last letter of the one above you. It is a good way to boost post count. Also along those lines is the "What are you thinking?" thread, which is now reset every month, because of how big it can get. It is an excellent forum, and I plan on stealing content from it now and then.]  http://www.absforums.com  	Those forums have made me think about the recent trend in men's fashion being more towards the "gay" side of the spectrum, kno? It seems like the trend is that ladies are saying that they want men to be "everything but gay" a.k.a. "metrosexual" (note the avid use of quotations, I type as I speak, so u can imagine me doing that quotation thing all of the time.). This bothers me. If ladies want gay guys, doesn't mean we are all doomed? So then I ponder: What exactly do they mean by "everything but gay"? This site:  http://www.intellectualwhores.com/masterladder.html  helped connect the dots a bit. I will postulate a theory. Some traits that are common among gay men, ladies actually want (proper grooming, complete comfort around women), some they say they wnat, but it would not be good to give it to them (interior decorating skills, ability to cry), and others they just don't want (buttsex). I would appreciate feedback on this topic. It intrigues me.  O, will someone tell me why "gullible" doesn't appear in the dictionary?  I pondered, recently, my love of cars and, by extension, people's love of cars. I think it began as I made a deposit in my savings account and looked at the balance. It was over 1400$. That is almost enough to put a new motor in my car! yay! but moving along. I wanted kill my mothere when she drove my car. She let my sister sit in the passenger seat (or rather, the seat closest to the passenger side door, as it is a big-body six seater). She told me to get into the back seat for a ride to work. in my car. that she was driving. that I hade to save 1500$ to buy. by working at McDonald's. As funny as it sounds, though, it wasn't just the money. That car is mine. I don't know how to explain it better than that. The car was even more mine than other things, liek my desk or chair. I guess you could say I was possesive of my possesion. I am almost territorial about that car. Weirder yet, I am not as possesive of my new (1987 model) car. I forget to lock the doors alot. I don't get it repaired right away. I have to prepare a lsit of things that need to get repaired on that thing. So, not only do I love cars, I only really LOVE one car. That is creepy, don't you think? Maybe I just need a gf. That isn't it, because I have had gfs while i had the car, indeed that is part of the reason I bought it initially--so I could date without getting a ride. I don't know. I guess I can't really explain it. I love cars. I should prolly mention that I named my car. I named my 1983 Oldsmobile Delta 88 (the car I LOVE) Heather. I name it after this chick with big knockers. She left town a cuppla years back. I named my 1987 Toyota Celica GT (the car that gets me to work, usually) Ta. It is a japanese term of endearment, usually expressed as Ta-Kun. OKOK I got it from a TV show, but that is still the name. Come to think of it, I also named my PC. I named it Edward, after Radical Edward from Cowboy Bebop. Edward is a girl. That is a detail. I think I will explain the rules surrounding naming. Cars and computers get names. My last computer was named Jill, after a skinny whore who still goes to our school. What was suppose to be my first car was named Nicole, after no person in particular. It was a 1989 Nissan Sentra. I had some fun in that car (don't tell the parents). After something has been deemed worthy of a name, you need to decide whether it is a male or female. How do you know? reliability. Unreliable things malfunction. mal-function. They get male names. Other things get female names. I had Edward running for a month straight, no prob. I also have made no reapirs to it. It is on almost 100% of the time. A computer/car msut be renamed after a large repair has been made. On a computer, this is at least a HDD. HDD, motherboard, processor, allgrounds for a re-name. In a car, if you replace the motor, as I intend to do with Heather, you must rename it. When Heather gets a new engine, she will get a female name, because she should be even more reliable than before. yah. that is how that works. I need to make that list of things to be repaired. I am taking the car in Tues. LATER!
