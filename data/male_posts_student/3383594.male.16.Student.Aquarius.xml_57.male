Well, I juz hope to pass, tt's bout' it. After tt, I was pretty tired. So I decided to go home first.  When I got home, I basically juz slacked, rested and ate my lunch. I wanted to take a nap, but I decided to go out instead. I went to play pool for about 3hrs wif a fren. After tt we had dinner and proceeded to boon lay interchange, where there was a pasam malam going on. We walked around for awhile and den went home. I dropped by West Mall to get some stuffs first before heading home.  There's this korean movie tt I realli wanna watch. It opens on 15th July and I simply can't wait for it. The title is "Brotherhood". It juz seems to be a realli interesting warfare movie. I hafta catch tt movie even if I hafta watch it alone or treat some1 to watch it. Hopefully I'll be able to go wif tt special some1 to watch it.  I felt pretty left out the past few days, tt's y I'm kindda depressed. Well, I dunnoe wad's the reason for them to do this, tt juz makes me upset. They're treatin me like an outcast and tt realli sucks. Guess I'll stop here for today. Cya~
