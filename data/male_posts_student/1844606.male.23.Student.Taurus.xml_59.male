Please don't let this reflect on me, I was smart enough to realize she was crazy when I was going out with her.   I'm going to do probably the first scholarly research on the representation of 9-11.  I'm actually excited about this.  I ate food outside my apartment and drank and didn't panic about it.  I inadvertantly got drunk off of Blue Moon.  I killed a mouse with my Psych textbook.  I get to go home this weekend.  Oh yes, and best of all, I got her number(s).  Don't know what it means, but I'm excited.
