Sponsored by  Gillette , women from all over will come to N.Y. in an attempt to win the grand prize, which is wortha reported $30,000. Trying to push the  Gillette  shaving products, the contest will be called "Legs of a Goddess."     If the aforementioned contest benefits the  Gillette  company, they may plan another shave-based contest. No word has been leaked on what part of the body will be judged, but the second competition has been rumoured to be named "No Muff in Front of Duff."
