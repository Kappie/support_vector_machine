Now Fun Day was devised as a way to lighten the mood at my school as final exams approach...Being a senior, with no final exams, it means a day like everything else with good food, dodgeball, and other rockadelic stuff. But, being the idiot i am, i became sick this monday. And this is the first monday i have   really   been sick. oh well... i slept till 11 30 so it was fun either way. My mom came home from Hong Kong today which was awesome. And she got my cumberbun (such a fun word) and my bow-tie while she was there. They are very much shway (a word i very rarely use). So that was my day i shall post something later of greater intelligence and meaning later...but right now im kind of out of it.
