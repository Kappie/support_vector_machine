I don't want to put my entire personal life on here though (I hear people saying, "but it's a blog, you're supposed to!", but I don't really care what you think, this is my life, not yours) so I'm not saying any more about it. Suffice it to say that it was a really bad day.  I'm so unfocused at the moment. I was furious earlier, now I'm just down. I'm hoping to be happy again tomorrow, but we'll see. If I was a Jedi, I'd be seriously heading towards the Dark Side right now. Not convinced I'm not anyway. Taking a more direct route than general though. Skipping right through the whole thing and going right to anger. There's a certain person out there tonight sitting there gloating, when he should be coughing his last breath. If I could get to him, he would be. Those of you who actually know me will know I mean that.  I'm listening to music to calm me down (it is supposed to soothe the savage beast after all, and that describes me right now). It's not working terribly well. I could do with a punchbag. Thought about punching the wall or the door or something earlier, but that would hurt and wouldn't go very far towards solving the problem in the first place. Could get drunk, but that won't help either.  Fuck it. Why am I even bothering writing this shit anyway? Nobody reads it.
