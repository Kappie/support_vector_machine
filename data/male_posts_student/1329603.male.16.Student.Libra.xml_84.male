Scott and I are meeting in town tomorrow... weeeeeeee!  Anyway, sorry I can't post more right now, I'm really tired, y'see.  I won't do a quote for today, I'll try and get one done later.  Love, Jon Roskilly  PS. Naomi's talking to me a bit now. Not that she wasn't for any reason before but we're getting on better, we're actually talking somewhat. Benefit!
