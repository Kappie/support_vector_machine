I replied to almost every thread in UG (www.ultimate-guitar.com) , and now, i'm basically collecting dust. I'm listening to Bleak by Opeth, they're a great band, very very creative. In case you don't know after reading my post of music, yeah i'm a big fan of prog............opeth, yes, dream theater, genesis etc. etc. as long as the songs exceed 8 minutes, i'll listen to it.......lol. I've also been scouring the net for piano scores, by Nobuo Uematsu especially. They're quite a few decent ones but I can't find the one I've been looking for, which is Sad Piano Theme from Final Fantasy VIII. That's a pretty easy but kinda sad song, that's basically my pre-dominant mood, Melancholy, lol..........  Anyway, hmmmm, i've been thinking lately about Love, after the crappy poem which I wrote, it really makes me want to think about love. To me, Love inspires poetry, Sadness inspires music, Angst inspires Argumentative writing. That's for me anyway, my three main outlets of expression. Yesterday, during CNY, i've really heard alot of stuff, one of my 17-year old cousin is going out with a 30 year old, why? He's rich, extravagant, and she's committment-phobic. I hardly make sweeping and stereotypical statement, but imo, its hollywood's fault.  Superficiality is the killer of every budding relationship, its like a very good, nice, friend, TOO nice in fact, only to stab you in the back later. Money, outward looks, humour, wit, and in some pathetic (emphasis on pathetic) chauvnistic guys' case, submissiveness also. I'm like give me a damn break man. Look at America, breakups, divorces............its like, the inside of a toilet bowl with a faulty flushing system after 10 fat men with diahorrea shits inside there. And no, the answer is not "ohhh ohh, we gotta bring back our UPRIGHT traditional christian values which made us prosperous since our forefathers stepped onto this holy land....." (can anybody say, bigot?) lol.   To me, what's the solution to the problem, its pretty simple,  "Don't look for the best partner, look for the best relationship."  Seriously, you can have a grade A partner but have the crappiest relationship ever, that guy may be the most handsome, witty, talented person you've ever met. But your relationship is lacking in trust, communication and fulfillment. Personally, i don't ask alot in a partner, there's no particular "quality" i look for in a partner. But i really ask alot in a relationship, anything short of satisfying and deep is out of the question to me.   Now, i'm very bored so my mind's kinda empty, and an empty mind is the devil's workshop which is why i never believe in Meditation, emptying your mind stuff. Meditation to me, is really to reflect and think..........but meh, i'm just bored now and got nothing to think about.............  I'll have a post later at night, hopefully...............
