It's interesting to hear the feedback from the movies, so no one else was disappointed that it didn't show Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup....I was im not going to lie about it.  Yeah Yeah, the movie couldn't be that long....but why not?  Anyone who goes to see the movie most likely has some interest in the book so they will not mind staying in the theatre an extra half hour to see some vital parts of the book. I am not saying I didn't enjoy the movie-it was quality, I am just saying I stayed up till 3:30 to see a movie and it didn't even have quite possibly one of the most important parts of the book in it.  So ya, enough about that. Now that thats over with, I would like to give a shout out to Ryan Vasbinder for his stunningly real portrayal of Alph, the TV icon, in the late 80's and early 90's.
