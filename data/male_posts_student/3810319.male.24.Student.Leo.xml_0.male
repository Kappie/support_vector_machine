I picked up PHP this morning thanks to the suggestion of a fellow JaxLUG member and I really like it.  It's far easier than perl in a web-based environment, at least for the simple database stuff I've done with it so far.  I look forward to seeing how much more I can do with the language.  I also intend to experiment with Python a bit, and further experiment with Ruby, which I've played with only a little once before.  Should be fun.  Darkmyst
