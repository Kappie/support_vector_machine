The only advantage being that we're playing Bemidji, so they'll have to be leaving about now to get to Alex by 9 tomorrow morning.  Also... what do you guys think of this cutting article? Link: http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4980465/ He makes some sure points, but his attacks dive way too far in my honest opinion. He starts to joke as he goes on, but the feeling's still there. Yes, Episode I was a big disappointment, but Episode II easily rectified the problems, and I can't wait for Episode III. Other ideas readers came up with were giving direction to Spielberg and plot to Shamaylan, which wouldn't be too bad in my opinion. Shamaylan is a dark genius, perfect for what Episode III has been set up to be. GL doesn't need to be totally ditched though.  I spent my first lazy weekend in probably months. Now that AP and English are all over, i didn't even bring my backpack home. I took a nap. A nap! I've been running on half a tank since about March. Unfortunately, I was feeling under the weather, and missed a Boxfest at Bryce's Saturday night, but that's alright.   In other news, I'm preparing myself in advance. I need some insults to throw back at the Germans when they start attacking me next year. I'm not gonna be a bigot and all, commenting about Hitler... I'll think up a lotta things more original than that. So far, I've got about one:  "Yeah, so how many  Germans  have been on the moon? Huh? Huh? Yeah, I thought so..." I could use some help, though, if anyone wanted to lend it... But then I've got to translate all of it, which might make it not even worth the trouble.   In early times some sufferer had to sit up with a toothache, and he put in the time inventing the German language. -Mark Twain
