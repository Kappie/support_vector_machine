Had breakfast with my Mum, Sisters and my nephew.. Eat and bought some kitchen stuffs.. Then, we reached home, I immediately change and set off to Bukit Batok.. Tend to get a new phone.. Darn!! Must be 18 and above to apply for a new line.. Dammit!! Argh!! Maybe tomorrow my Mum will go there and apply for me.. *SiGhZz* Reached home and helped my Mum clean up the house before I eat my lunch.. Nothing much after that.. Normal things.. Not much today.. Maybe tomorrow.. Haha! Jenni was pissed with me last night.. *UrGhHzZ*! She don't wanna be with me.. And I'm just wasting my time fooling around hoping she'd fall for me.. I'm wrong.. Forget bout that.. So many fishes in the seas.. Lose one there's plenty to look upon.. Right?? Hahaha! Anyway.. Kept on thinking bout Cheryl.. I, myself, don't know why... Hahaha!! Ok ok.. Enough with the bragging..   Peace Out!!!!
