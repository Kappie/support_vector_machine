(uh..that was Ice Man, EBs)    :) Not to sound gay, but is that not the most infectious, joyous canadian smile in the game?!  Can anyone of us truly imagine the feeling of being 4 wins from hoisting the Cup, not to mention all the little victories along the way!?!    And what a class act by Sutter - he stood at the Sharks bench and waited till the players shook hands, then shook hands with each of the Sharks - most of whom he coached just last year.  I'll be pulling for the Flames in the finals, even over the 'Ning.    On CBC, they had Mike Vernon on Kelly Hrudy's intermission show.  It was like two buddies chatting about the good old days, only without the brews and the cursing.  Vernon was talking about a toe save he made back in 1984!   It was the '89 playoffs really, but they WERE talking about stuff from 1984, like the Scouts and the Rockies!    I think 1984 was the last time I played goalie.  We got sticks for Christmas (it was sometime in the mid 80's...) and were playing in the lot next door to our place on Mulberry.  I took a tennis ball to the eye - flush-on -  scared the shit outta me.  And by 'shit' I DO mean "the desire to stand in front of projectiles intended to pass through you like chopsticks through a wooden door" - a'la Real People or That's Incredible, whichever it was.  Would it be academically logical, then, to say that goalies are full of 'shit' ?
