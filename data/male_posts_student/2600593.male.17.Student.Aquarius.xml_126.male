      Yes loyal TSS fans, it is over. The San Fansico base show is now come to its end, and I am very frightened at what the future may bring. My heart goes out to all the cast and crew that made this woderful show.     Also to all you geeks out there that are expected to work on family members computers check this  urlLink blog  out.   P.S.- I really really HATE G4, yay that feels good.
