For some reason ive been listening to the moulin rouge cd all day, ive never realized how great it was untill today. And i totally agree with one of the lines on the cd "the greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love, and be loved in return" ok im not an overemotional guy, but think about it. Feeling over fact may not always be "correct" in a sense, but its the only way the soul can manifest itself in your every actions and that is my reason for be a romantic. Being simple does not necessarily mean you're stupid, quite the contrary often we do not see the truth because it is so simple. Many people overthink things and problems, but if we could just sit down and listen to that part of us that knows the absolute truth we will be better off. Ill explain my views on absolute truth sometime later in my blogg. What is it within me that cries out for love, beauty, and truth.
