Let me tell you, it's not a nice place to be, not a nice time to be in something like that. I'm very serious at the moment, regarding just about everything I come into contact with. Frankly, it scares me and I hope to snap out of it soon. I'm serious about my relationship (which I hope it booms over'n'over again), 'bout my work, my life in general. I know all this sounds strange coming from me, but there's nothing I can do about it, I just feel that way, it's a flow that cannot be stopped that easily.  Then again, it's very hard to exactly define what's going through my mind, I just want to be taken seriously, maybe that's why I'm being serious... ...and I think that's a wrong approach, but I've tried everything possible to let people see what I'm all about. Those people are now gone from my life, just because I wanted it that way, 'cause I got tired of listening to all sorts of bullshit. I kept reminding myself that I should stop, and so I did.  It doesn't matter, I got used to starting from scratch everytime something happened. I hope this is the last time I have to do something from the beginning.  Take care now...
