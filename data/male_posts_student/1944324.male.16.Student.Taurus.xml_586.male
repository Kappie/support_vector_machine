Some of this stuff, you just can't make it up. I could have sworn we were going to get arrested for breaking and entering.  I saw "Troy" yesterday. It's an interesting movie. Brad Pitt was very pretty. Orlando Bloom was funny as Paris because he was such a big wimp. And he did a lot of Legolas bow-and-arrow stuff and a lot of Will Turner sword stuff. I loved Hector and I was sad when he died. We cheered three times. The first was for the King Arthur trailer, which was awesome. The second time was when Rose Byrne (Dorm√© from AOTC), who played Briseis, stabbed Agamemnon in the neck. It must have been the handmaiden training. The third was when Aeneas got a little cameo. But they did so many things wrong in that movie. For example, the Trojan War was supposed to be nine years long, and in the movie it was about 16 days. And that's counting the twelve-day timeout for Hector's funeral. There's lots more, but my friend Alicia is writing a review of it,a and I get to comment upon it, so I will probably be more coherent after that.   I now own three more Discworld books! I have Small Gods, Hogfather, and The Fifth Elephant. The only books in the main series that I don't have now are Reaper Man and Thief of Time. I'm most excited about having Fifth Elephant because that was the second DW book I read and I can't remember what happens. I looked through all the Carrot and Angua parts last night, and they are really so touching when you know Carrot and Angua. He goes after her. He almost says he loves her. He holds her hand. He promises to kill her if he ever needs to. She cries. She gets called a dog. She fights her family. She says, "Carrot's mine." I love that couple. They're so screwed up.    Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.
