Class was boring as usual, the teacher just went over what we read in the textbook, so during the time I read all of Katha's blog, including one of those gazillion question quizzes. It must've asked "are you gay?" a hundred times.  I had my lesson this morning, it went pretty well except for the fact that the new pianist couldn't read Beethoven's Spring violin sonata. I don't blame her, the piano part is like a concerto, just much more transparent. Anyhow, Alice probably won't hire her. After my lesson I feel like I can do anything, the weekend is here and there's nothing stopping me from doing anything I want. Then Thursday shows up again and I've only practiced like.. 3 hours all week. I guess I haven't wanted to be a musician that badly. Maybe I do, but these are the years where you can't mess around. Anyway...  It's rather unorganized right now, but it sounds like some people from the RPYO group might go to Suzannah (opera) tonight. I heard that my neighboor's daughter made the set or something, so my parents are being goody-goody neighboors and going to show their support. I should call up various people and see what we're doing.
