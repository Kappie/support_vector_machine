When did Richard Jefferson get this bad? Luckily Lamar Odom bailed them out with a bunch of big plays on defense.  Then, today they beat Australia. I didn't see the game, but from what I heard, we actually played really well in the 2nd half. Looking at the boxscore, Iverson, Duncan, and Marion played really well. Seems like Wade played good too, and Richard Jefferson only took 3 shots. It would be nice if we actually played a complete game, but hopefully the winning continues.  The Yankees Pitching has been scary, and not in a good way. I don't think there is one pitcher on their roster who you can be confident in to pitch good in the playoffs. At this point, El Duque might be our best pitcher. Mussina is back, but he struggled in his first start back, and hadn't exactly been tearing it up before he went on the DL. Kevin Brown has been pretty good, but not great, and not consistent at all. Same with Vazquez. Lieber put together a couple of good starts in a row, but I'm not counting on that continuing. Loaiza has been consistent. Consistently giving up 4-5 runs a game while pitching only 5 or 6 innings. That isn't going to cut it. If all our pitchers get hot at the same time, we could still go all the way. Otherwise, it might be an early exit for the 2nd time in 3 years.  That's all I really have to say now. I did add a counter on the bottom of the page to see how many people actually read this shit. I'll probably write again after the Jets preseason game this Saturday vs. the Colts.
