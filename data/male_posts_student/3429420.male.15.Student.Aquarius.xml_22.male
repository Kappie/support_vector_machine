Fallen so many times to dark pits Hurt, torn and shattered.  They say men should have no fear But to me the world was divided by fears Fears that could end everything Fears that others would not understand And I Fear that love could end a friend  Why must the tears linger for the winterâ€™s chill? When will the sun shine the light? When will the rain wash away all the wounds?
