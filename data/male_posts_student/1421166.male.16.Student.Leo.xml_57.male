Have been thinking alot about my studies, band and church. Guess my gift is to be worker. And I know I'm not a leader for sure. So I'll serve...hehe. Don't know what to say. Too lazy to talk about things actually. Ok...will blog proper again after my competition la. Anyway, thank Emilia! Look forward to talking to you.
