Sigh... lets have a simple breakdown of my day..  First up was waking up to a msg from someone telling me her exam results.. did quite well.. so obviously i smsed back and congratulated her.. and promptly fell back to sleep.. and then went to 'overdrive' =X  Skip breakfast and smsing nadiah to comfirm wat time to meet to revise.. i had a headache already.. (its getting pretty common it seems =X) went to play PS2.. forgot to heal my mothership and it got pummeled by a  SUPER  boss.. one hour of work and quick save+load gone.. (the most headache part was trying to attain near death status on one of my units for secrets.. many brain cells and about half an hour of trying later, i did it)  i screamed "BIG F***" like some bloody sissy (more wailings followed)..  and of course promptly dressed up and got out of the damned house.. (Damn you Dark Emperor!!!)  Revise and all that.. also had a surprised phonecall.. travelling made my headache worse.. =X not having lunch and teaching all the way to 3pm also did not help it.. man i feel horrible by then.. had to rush to com lab to find my exam sitting number... crap man..  with computer maths attacking me like a bunch of starved chicken.. many brain cells did not survive the onslaught.. May those who have forfeited their lives rest in eternal peace for they have fought with honour for a better future. May their wills find sanctuary.  Wats next... oh ya.. then after that to the mensa for some bubor hitam!!   but   no more le... =XXX ub3r crap.. then walked the gate out.. and i thought i treated myself to some chocolate chip ice cream.. thats when i found this uncle who sells the ice cream for 80 cents, not $1 and gives either 4 pieces of waffer biscuts or HIGHER quality bread instead of the cheap crap.. (sunshine bread i believe). Oh ya.. then walked passed near a coffeeshop with GREAT SMELLING  char kuey teoh ... (you can bet im having  that  for lunch 2moro)  then jus walked aimlessly.. bought newspaper from a roadsite ah pek.. sat at a place nice and quiet to read.. eating ice cream.. still waiting for yang feng's call.. also recieved a funny sms from dexter =P  by arnd 6.. i decided to leave.. and called someone to chat.. appears she jus woke up too.. nice timing =P chased after a packed bus.. and well.. im here now, writing thise blog =X  This blog is also a dedication to Poh Yang Feng, my friend since primary 5 who did alot of shit with me back then. His birthday is today so here i am, wishing him  HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!  I suppose i should go back to my PS2 now.. and get revenge and kill the Dark Emperor. And try beating Eunice at hexic or bejeweled.. (which is forever futile)  P.S : Once again, Happy birthday yang feng ^^ if you wanna wish him happy birthday jus sms me and i will do it on your behalf ^^  P.P.S : Dex called.. yay i got a lunch date 2moro ^^  P.P.P.S : This time its pretty short ;)  R.P.S : I was eating a nougat jus now.. i love these things =D
