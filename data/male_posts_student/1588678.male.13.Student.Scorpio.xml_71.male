Okay, well, I love the fact that the weekend is finally arrived, but it sucks because while EVERYONE I know is at the movies, or doing some other shit I'M stuck playing my guitar and writing lyrics about everything in the world. Well, all and all, Fridays suck for me!  I hope your Friday doesn't suck as much as mine. Later.
