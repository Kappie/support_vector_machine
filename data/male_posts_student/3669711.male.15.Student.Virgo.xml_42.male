Right now, lines of source being compiled flow across the screen as it is compiling fluxbox, my Desktop Environment of choice.  ^_^ I'm just so happy at the moment, i think i'm going to shed a little tear.  It has taken me almost a year to hear about linux, learn about linux, start trying to install linux, and then finally install it!  Yes, i remember watching a friend in the computer lab using a console talking to his linux box at home. I remember asking him what it was, and i remember his reply 'Linux'.  What a great word.  Music to my ears.  I'll let you know how everything turns out.  Lates
