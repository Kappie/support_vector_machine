The game of the day is now going to come right after the download of the day, and right before the daily feature.  But, lets get to it already.    Today's site of the day is 1up.com.  Ziff Davis, the creators of popular gaming publications such as EGM, GMR, and Xbox Nation, have put together a new site that comes in a flashy package.  The site just relaunched yesterday with a brand new look, and it looks great.  However, there are a couple minor problems that make this site not as great as IGN was yesterday.    The first of those problems being: The whole page doesn't load correctly.  The images aren't working half the time.  Hell, sometimes you may not even get any of the page.  I realize that they just launched this, but, if they want to keep going and have people coming to their site, they had better fix it.  Or else they may be in trouble.  1up offers some of the better reviews for console and PC games out there, and offers a smart organization of news and things.  You can also check magazine sites directly from 1up, and get a sampling of their reviews right there on the website.    This site also features a unique user page system, similar to IGN, which allows you to customize with a picture, your game collection, a wishlist, your favorites list, and much, much more.  But, the design for your collection and everything like that, is terrible.  Right next to the game's name is, in big letters, "Add to Faves," which makes it look really, really bad.    The site itself doesn't look bad when its fully loaded, but, like I said, if they don't fix the problem they're having, they will probably have to start it all over again.  It looks terrible right now, the way things don't load right.  Other than that, it looks good.    Now, I haven't found too many reviews on 1up in the past year that I have not agreed with, but, there are a few.  Not as many, as say, tomorrow's site of the day, GameSpot, but, there are a few.  With all these big websites, there tend to be editors who are biased towards one of the game consoles, and that's bad.  Really bad, because it gives the whole site a bad name.    So, aside from the content loading rather slow on occasions, and a few of the reviews being biased, 1up.com is the best place to go to get gaming news, and stuff of that matter.     urlLink    1up's new design looks good, but, some major issues about loading need to be addressed. Quickly. urlLink       Pros  +From the same people that brought you EGM +Nice User Page Interaction +Nice design   Cons  -Design does not load correctly -User page interaction looks bad -User page interaction requires you to put personal information on the page   Score  Fun Factor: 75%-C Graphics/Layout: 85%-B Speed: 55%-F Customization/Controls: 70% C Final:  71.25%-C    Up Next:  The Download of the day, ObjectDock.
