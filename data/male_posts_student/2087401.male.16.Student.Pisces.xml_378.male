I'll leave the rest of the actual plays to Erin. I signed up for an Improv workshop, which would be more fun if almost everyone didn't suck at it. Questions only was fun, though, I wiped the floor with those would-be Inquisitors.     Michael -When did you see the books?  Did you see my  The Almost Complete Works of ?   Nate -We don't constantly talk of lc teachers. I just described him, anyway, rather than just throwing him i a post expecting you to know about him.  And I'm with Michael on the matter of recruitment, we have plenty of bloggers.  Maybe you should start a mostly LN blog.  Only you, Jonah and I even know Tyler and Paul, so you could be admin to a sort of sister blog to Compendium. An affiliate, if you will.    Everyone -Buy tickets for Design for murder! Its good! details from erin, cuz she already posted it!  The vegetable must be destroyed!
