She's gotta get into stand up comedy. Haha! Also had a talk with Derry about... stuff. Weird but only to an extent. It was cool though. Funny guy. Not as bad as I thought.   Wrote a letter to Elbert cos Delia's gonna see his ex, Cindy, and she's gonna give it to Cindy to give to Elbert. ^^ I hope he'll write back or email back or whatever. Haven't spoken to him in a while. Blah.  Left my guitar at Nima's gotta pick it up before tomorrow's guitar class. Maybe I'll get it tomorrow after school. Looks like it's gonna rain tomorrow so mom will probably pick us up after school. Or not... I dunno. Doesn't matter. But if she does, then I'll get her to drive me by Monaco to pick it up.   Nima's such a cutie! (uh huh!) Hehe~! So yeah... wrote our little description stuff of our friends for grad and I wrote about Moca. So funny~! Too bad you can't include inside jokes. Meh, whatever.  Well, I'm off... listening to music and taking a nap. Nima said he'd call tonight but iunno... blah. I'm off for now. Peace.
