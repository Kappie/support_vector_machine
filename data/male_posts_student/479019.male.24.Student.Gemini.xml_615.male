I did a lot of photocopying and got 40 pages of reading. Not bad for today. Note to self: bring sunglasses when you know you'll be doing a lot of copying.  Hopefully being more active this semester will aid in getting my brain back in shape. A rather cute girl initiated a conversation with me at the copiers, but my wit has been retarded by 12 hrs of sleep daily and lots of beer. I plan on cutting back to 7 hrs and doing more brain exercising like art.   Pizza dough rising right now. I decided to use 6 cups of flour for aproximately 6 pizzas worth of dough. Hopefully I multiplied things right.  ***
