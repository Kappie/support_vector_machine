Not that talking to Kelly is a problem, it was simply a very long conversation, and it was very enlightening.  You see, Kelly is part of my secret ultra-black people lifestyle, that I secretly hide from everyone else.  We were scheduled to do a Nangila (our test organization) poetry reading on May 29, but we haven't planned.  So Kelz calls Keisha and Quan, and we were talking about it for awhile and eventually we settled on cancelling it.  So Keisha and Quan hung up and me and Kelly were talking.  I'd mentioned to Jodie earlier, that I hadn't talked to Kelly for ages.  She said I should stop being so stoic with Kelly, which Kelly echoed when I was talking to her.  She said I seemed to be in my own cute little box.  Never really thought about that, but I guess it was true, and yes they did use the word stoic.  Sadly, we cancelled the reading, and are also considering just stopping Nangila.  I guess it was a good run, but we aren't the original Nangila people nor do we have the devotion or time necessary to devote to it.  So I guess we're going to put it down.
