But all that doesn't matter, its finding out and remembering how and why couples fell in love with each other again that is more important. With that in mind, one can always treasure and cherish their love ones. Married man should be happy, cause they have their entire life time to pursue their wife. HEhehe like that phrase a lot. Hey, check Shrek II out if you haven been to the cinema for like months.  Ahh.... For the rest of the day, I was too lazy to start on any cards. slack slack slack slack slack.........
