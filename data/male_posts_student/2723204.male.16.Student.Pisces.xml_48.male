I decided to write something, about cloning essentially, but what I intend to expound on is the relevance of the church in modern society. What constitutes religious revival and decline.   I actually noticed this thread quite a while back but after flipping through the pages of this forum, well, i decided to write something. I don't know much about the biological technicalities of cloning. But really, epistemologically speaking, it is only a matter of time when "perfect" cloning is attained, as in cloning where there would be no diseases or side effects to the guy who got cloned.   Well, morally speaking, and as a Christian, I see no wrong in cloning. Are men playing God? I don't think so. To me it is simply an alternative avenue for reproduction. I mean, God does not magically pops out babies out of nowhere. Sexual reproduction involves the willingness of 2 parties (and in some unfortunate cases, 1..) to have intercourse in order to reproduce. There is a human element to it, and it can be biologically explained. Are humans playing God through sexual reproduction? Why not pray for God to send a baby to your doorstep?! Aren't we creating babies through sexual reproduction, and aren't we also creating babies, except its identical through cloning?   Sexuality has always been an important part of human life and it will continue to be so, it would take a very long time or it may not even happen at all for cloning to overtake sexual reproduction. As long as people persist in cloning research, there would be breakthroughs in it, and successful cloning would be possible. I don't see how is cloning playing God. If God created the land and solid ground for us to stand on, then I can say that Singapore has quite alot of explaining to do as to why it is "playing God" by reclaiming land. Maybe Jurong Island can be the next tower of Babel.   Don't think that technology which somehow is fantastic, and which brings things which we think is in the realm of the impossible (ie. in the realm of God) and bring it down to Earth, such as cloning, it is necessarily pride and "playing God". Well, that is the case of Galilee, the heavens, to the church at that time was something unexplainable and when Galilee came and put something so "out of this world" to them into simple terms, they all went berserk. Well, don't be like the church at that time, denying things out of religious pride, only to be proven wrong a few decades down the road.   Just a side note, ultimately, if the church wants to prove it is relevant in this society. Being in fashion and in vogue is not enough. Culture not only entails fashion, but it also entails values, beliefs and technology. Being hip and cool is nothing short of superficial. Churches should always seek to question extensively the values and beliefs of their culture and adopt those which are complementary to the christian faith, but at the same time be a powerful and strong critic of beliefs which are contrary to our faith. Instead of using rhetoric, we need to prove to be a formidable critique of certain cultural beliefs and norms. The secular world cannot be won over by the bible, and neither can they be won over through rhetoric.  Churches should participate in active dialogue with members of the intellectual community, especially with those of the human sciences. Religion has found increasing compatibility with the physical sciences, with probably evolution as the exception. It is social principles and norms which threaten the credibility of the ecclesial institution. Christian cannot afford to degrade into a form of casual determinism and a collection of arbitrary assumptions. I shall highlight what I believe the church needs to stay relevant from a sociological and philosophical standpoint, and not a theological one.  That one coming up soon, intending to write a full-sized paper.
