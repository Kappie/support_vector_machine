I get worried whenever I'm skateboarding because im afraid of breaking a limb. I hope never break any. I have been worried many times in my life for different reasons. One memorable one is about a friendship with my best friend, i worry that we would not be friends forever. I cherish the friendship i have with her now as i know that a friend like her are hard to come by. There have been occasions where we have had our differences but i still forgive her for her wrong doings and i hope that she forgives me for mine. I also worry about how my life would be if certain things that i have said or done to her would change certain things. I just hope the choices i have made are the best and that things could not have been better if i hadn't made these choices. I really hope to have an everlasting friendship with my dear good friend Sarah! Another common worry that some of us share is the passing of our parents. I'm really thankful for them as they have provided me with a wonderful life full of love and care. I know have been a pain in the ass to them for all the countless times that i lied, cheated, stole, was rude and disobedient to them. I really hope to change for the better so as to make life easier for them as they aren't getting any younger. The older they get the more i worry, i worry that if one of them do pass away, who is gonna help look after the family. I don't think that my relatives will can support my brother, sister and me. I hope that life would be a smooth journey ahead for both my parents.
