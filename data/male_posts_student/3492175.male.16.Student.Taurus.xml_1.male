I saw Rachel for the last time for a long time which was very sad, and then to top that off i think i forgot to say a parting message of love. well, hopefully she'll read this and know i meant to. meh. i ate alot today, but thats really only interesting to me. also i discovered that Karl Marx was the man, and i should definetly figure out how to grow up like THAT. and learn to live in the woods, that would be fun.  Heres an awesome quote from my mom: "Dont worry, Just scrape the top off and eat the rest" - on the subject of 2 month old ice cream.  i guess its ok to just write in here, so ill ramble a bit. if you dont care, you can tune out at this point, the important things are said...i think. meh. i miss people already. I wish we all lived in the same place. dancing is good. very good. yeah, my ramble got lost in my head. try waking up thinking of someone you love. it gives a bright outlook on the day.
