People these days (including myself). I'm in school right now, I hate it with a passion. Oh well, I don't know, if its my only way out of Colorado then I have to do it. Sure I want to go to college out of state, but I don't think I would be able to handle living in another state and being responsible, but I guess its a rite of passage. Good day, I'll be back later with updates on this day that is ultimately going to become a bad one.
