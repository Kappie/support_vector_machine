What they are demonstrating to the world with great clarity is that if you want to deter US aggression you better have weapons of mass destruction, or else a credible threat of terror. That's a terrible lesson to teach, but it's exactly what's being taught." -Noam Chomsky in the Guardian. I thought that was a pretty funny quote.  Oh yea... I wanted to say something about... erm... someone in one of my classes. Silence is sometimes intriguing.   ***
