I'm pissed though cause I just spent like 15 minutes writing up my first post and I accidently erased it. FUCK. But it's ok... I'll start over.  A lot of things on my mind lately. I've decided that I don't like highschool. I want to get out of here and leave all this mess behind, ya know? I just don't want to deal with it all. You don't realize how much I want to go to college right now... Leave. Somwhere far away from my parents, somwhere real.. somewhere I am free from any restrictions. I feel only then can I become the person I'm suppost to be, no limitations whatsoever. I don't want to deal with pety highschool drama or go through the same damn routine anymore. It's all just so ridiculously stupid. Even when I get caught up in the drama, I find myself thinking " ok, what the hell is this. i don't want to deal with this, it's so damn stupid. why am i wasting my time and my effort on something so meaningless. stupid bitches... " We're not gonna have time for that stuff in college, I can tell you that. We're gonna spend our time getting drunk stupid, getting high, and partying (when we're not studying, of course). No time for beef, no time for drama! And no time for stupid bitches!  On another note, Happy Sweet 16, Tiffany! I hope you like me and Hubert's gift. Sorry that you couldn't find the poem. I spent a lot of time and effort pouring my heart and soul into that! Each and every word held so much meaning and passion... And Hubert spent alot of time folding that crane-envelope shit the poem was in. But don't feel guilty! Cuz the point is you're 16, and that's cool. And.. of course.. I have the poem saved on my hard-drive, and it is available upon request.   And that's my time.. I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
