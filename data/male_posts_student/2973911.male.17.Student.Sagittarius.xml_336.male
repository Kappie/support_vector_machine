Eniweys, I have a new dilemma.  I suppose we talk about me not knowing what love is, but then, I always think it be the only appropriate term EVERY SINGLE TIME I remember that girl I was obsessed with at high school BUT NEVER got the sh@t to even be friends.  Well, this anti-social thing is getting obsolete.  Not that I don't choose my "friends" anymore.  It is just not very useful, especially if you want to argue things or desire to know various forms of knowledge.  Hep.  That's enough vanity for the moment.  Marianne... I'm beginning to hate/love that name.  I had the notion that favor of female counterparts is about sexual desires.  I could be wrong.  Well, I may have g@dam# problems in making that f^!king webpage.  The hump of precision-crafted metals and plastic known as my PC is getting outta hand.  I can't access disks that I can access in this public computer, while I can't access here the disk which I use at home.  Friggin aye.  Help.  Ryan, I know that printer port network musta work.  Please?  I have a nice header and footer for my page, only I cannot upload it!!!
