It's been a long time since I had one, so now, I remember how it is to use all your free time in someone that is not one... SO WORTH IT!  I don't watch TV, I have more than 30 hrs on video ( almost since the new season started )... I just barely got a glimpse of Thursday's must see TV. Believe me, two months ago if I was not watching TV I was recording everything directv had to offer me ... now I just have one thing in mind: my baby!  Not even school can put me to rest... this past week I spent all nights with him ( he was at work, so I kept him company ) for almost 5 hrs a night. I ended up tired, but happy! Now that I see things in perspective, I just can't believe I used a whole week just hanging with him... that much I love him... I have a special memory, is kinda bittersweet but anyway, I tend to remember the sweet part: The last night I spent with him, I was tired, so I laid down and tried to have some sleep, he went up to me and then laid down with me... I was comfortable, at peace... I felt, loved, and fell asleep...   You know, that's how I see our relationship, is a mature, sweet, laid back, calm, peaceful relationship... there's the sexual tension of course, well, maybe not tension... desire is the word... and that spice it a bit... I know, that I can count on him anytime I need someone. He will be there for me... and I'll be there for him too. And you know what's the best part? He's funny... he makes me feel loved, like someone cares for me... as much as I care for him... Love you Adrian...!  Later, TV review, featuring: Happy family, las Vegas, Friends, Coupling, etcetera... if you see a pattern here ( NBC ) is 'cause I suddendly lost the signal on ABC, FOX, CBS and teh WB and UP networks... so I was left with private channels and NBC...
