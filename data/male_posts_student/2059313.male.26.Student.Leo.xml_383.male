I'm on my roommate's computer right now, just so I can check my e-mail and give this quick update.  By the time I have my computer back in working order, I'll hopefully have even more great tales to retell.  Here's some things to look forward to:  - Hiking/Rock Climbing Trip to Red River Gorge - Holocaust Remberance Day (this one's a bit tricky) - Trip to NY for a Wedding and Site-seeing  Hopefully DELL will be able to help me get up and running quickly.
