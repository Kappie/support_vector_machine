Then, a week before enrollment, I wrote the names, times, course codes, and registration information of each of the courses I wanted to take on Post-it notes, then stuck them to my wall in timetable order.    Yesterday, my supervisor asked me what my schedule for the school year would look like, so that he could assign me hours.  At the time, I only had a vague idea, so I told him I'd check and get back to him.  Today, I checked my timetable, only to discover a timetable conflict.  (insert loud profanity here)  It's quite a big deal to me, since it appears I'm one of a rare breed of university students that enjoys university for the education.  However, there's still a bit of a juggling act to be done.  Some courses are less of a joy to partake in than others, but I have to take them to finish my degree.  In this case, I'm stuck between a Group II course and a Group III course.  U of T's East Asian department categorizes courses into three groups: Group I language courses (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and sometimes Vietnamese), Group II "core" courses (history, politics, and religion), and Group III specialized courses (what makes them different from Group II courses escapes me for the moment).  In addition to a reasonable level of proficiency in at least one East Asian language, my degree requires that I take a certain number of Group II courses, which make of the bulk of my degree.  Group III courses carry considerably less value, so I'm only permitted to take a certain number that will count toward my degree.  The two courses that conflict are a full-year Group II course and a half year Group III course.  The full-year course is "approaches to Modern East Asian History", and the half-year course is "Fundamentals of Japanese Grammar".  The former is more important in terms of completing my degree, but also more important in terms of learning what the course has to offer, so that upon graduation, I don't find myself a "paper tiger", so to speak.  The latter course holds more interest to me, but is clearly less important both in terms of accomplishing my degree and the importance of the content, since I'm taking the core second-year Japanese language course and (hopefully) I'll be going to Japan for my third year, where I'll probably O.D. on Japanese copulas and auxiliaries.  It's an easy choice, in terms of what I have to do, although I'll drop the grammar course grudgingly.  There's no question in my mind that it's the right choice to make; it's just not the fun one.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to replace the half-credit with something else, since the selection of East Asian courses provided slim pickings to start with.  By the way, the 1st annual timetable screw-up had me registering for a dental anthropology course instead of the pop culture course I had intended to take.  You can imagine my surprise when I walked in (late) to the first class, and then my embarrassment as I announced I was in the wrong class and excused myself :P
