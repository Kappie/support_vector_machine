Anyway, ran out of muesli bars this morning, had to settle for two "Sor Ta Pia" (Plain crackers) for breakfast, Sucks man, lol but theres nothing else to eat.   After bathing, i found out tat im 15mins late if i wan to take the bus 147, so no choice, forced myself to take mrt to work, but this time it only took me 50mins to reach the school including the torturous walk from the mrt.. Hmmz got to reconsider my options now, MRT OR BUS..  The P4s are supposed to finish their presentation by today, but all the groups did not do at all! My colleague was damn fired up, scolded them for 5mins, seeing their sad faces, im also sad, but had to scold them..  The P5s are better, all the groups finished their presentations, and i had to pick out their mistakes and tell them wat to do with their form teacher standing behind me, and i felt this "pressure" behind me, phew~ glad its over today, but there are still a lot of such sessions to go within this week. HAIZ~  Got to know two mischievous P5 kids, Kevin and Suriya (i called him suria channel, haha), Kevin is the one tat kept disturbing me.. Haha kids... and kevin told me tat everybody in the school noes suriya, can see why, damn playful kid.. haha, but they are cute overall..  During their discussions, they had a lot of problems, not with the presentation, but within themselves! Haha, those pri sch bickering, i did it in pri sch before! Things like "dont friend u", "shut up",  hahaha. Pri sch politics!   Continue printing the brochures today, the printer gave no problems today, YES! Managed to finish a LOT of work!  Headed straight home as usual, with no extra $$ and feeling dead tired, how to hang out! Haha, went home to my Ou xuan at 9pm, and i heard liang ni's going to cover the olympics WOOHOO, i cant wait!  My friend who read my posting yesterday, knew that im mesmerized with ou xuan, and to my surprised! Ou Xuan is actually, her fren's fren! OMG! I was damn excited man! But due to her current star status, dun tink theres any chance to know her! hahaha, oh well...   WORK WORK WORK, tomolo work again, hope tomolo classes had finished all their presentations, or else will get scolding again.. Haha, Sleep time! Suzanne Jung tomolo morning again.. WOOHOO!
