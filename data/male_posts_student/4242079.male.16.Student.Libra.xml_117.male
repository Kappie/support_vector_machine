Since I was gone all weekend, I had no key, so I figured I'd just stop by Bryce's house and pick one up. Bryce answered his cell and told me he was in Edmonton, and Aaron was supposed to get a hold of me to arrange to get me a key. Aaron had never called, so I had no key. I couldn't get a hold of Aaron because I didn't know his phone number. And my boss got mad at Bryce and I when Aaron didn't bother to do what he said he was going to. Then, he knew I didn't have a key and that Bryce was out of town, and he still didn't bother to even show up to unlock the store. And somehow it's my fault. The second reason my boss is mad at me is because of yesterday. I was scheduled to work 9-4. Fine. Then he asked me to stay later to clean the store and get it ready for the president of the company (who was supposed to show up sometime today). That's fine. I stayed until 6:30, thinking I was making overtime. Turns out, I wasn't even getting paid after 4 o clock. So I walked out. Now, how can he be mad at me for that? I don't know, but he is.  That's my rant.  Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I helped Crystal with studying for her social exams. She keeps telling me about her current situation with this Jew guy. Not that he's Jewish, I don't think he is, that's just a nickname. As far as I can tell, anyway. At any rate, she keeps asking what she should do, and it really hurts me that I can't offer her a fair opinion. Any input I would have into the situation would be biased. Biased in the way that I can't tell her to go for it, because my personal opinion is that she shouldn't. But the reason that my personal opinion stands there is because I still want her. So, I can't possibly tell her to go another way. It just wouldn't work.  That's my other rant.  I'm done now.
