The kind of weather where i just want to lay in a park and let the sun sap away all my strength. Too bad i have my night class tonight. The semester is almost over, Holy crap. When did that happen? Am getting really tired of bad elevator etiquette. I mean, why crowd the door to get on, some people have to get out of the elevator and you standing there not budging does not help. Facking Arsepicks. Mayday on sunday. Am not as excited as i should be. Perhaps the effect of all my homework that i have left to do. /cheers d
