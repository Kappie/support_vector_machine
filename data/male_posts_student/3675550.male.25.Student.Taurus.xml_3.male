On my way back to IH "International House my college", i was virtually shivering and barely could onto the steering wheel... Then when i check the temperature online... it was 4degress celcius! Wow... breaking the record i experienced last winter of 6 deg celcius... Remembering that Ken Han is still studying at Boon Tiong's place... i called to advice him not to go home tonight because cycling in this cold weather with hardly enough clothes on is not adviceable...  Well... good luck to their Traffic exam tomorrow morning! ;)    urlLink Website For weather Report
