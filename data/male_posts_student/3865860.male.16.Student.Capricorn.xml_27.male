Well I didn't see the start of the first one :( Also just by searching around i found out that you can call a servitor up to help you slow or speed time up. (  urlLink http://www.chaosmatrix.org/library/chaos/texts/fotamec1.html  ) I thought it would be pretty cool if this works. I have heard countless stories of people saying it does but im yet to experience it. Oo might be going swimming late aswell, just thought i'd tell you. I decided to do my blog now instead of later so i wouldn't forget,  if anything really interesting happens between now and tomorrow I will post another blog then :)  Anyway i better go and try to call up my Dragon Guardian Buh byes :)  Tom
