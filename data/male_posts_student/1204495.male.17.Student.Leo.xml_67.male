I should start a little countdown.. but quite frankly I can't work anything out at all.. my head's fucked... hehe. SLEEP. Need sleep. I slept for about 2 hours in the garden.. it's been really hot up here.. haven't been able to appreciate it coz I just feel icky.. y'know when you've not slept for... LONG time? Like that.. sick and eughk.. no matter how many showers you have you still feel like you need more. Then again you're a guy. Guy sleepovers [if they even have them! most of them don't, I know] .. well anyway.. from what I've heard from guys about sleepovers... they sit and play on the playstation, or whatever other gaming platform thing is out.. X-box, whatever.. eat.. pass a lot of wind and laugh about it, and every now and again ask each other "so, who do you like then?" ... then the other one answers and it's like "oh, cool.." ...or... "eughk.. alright then"... but of course this is only guys in my old school. w00t! OLD school. =D YeY.. awwww you're away. I said I'd keep it updated, though I'm not sure what you want in here.. so I'll have my ramblings in here.. and in my own.. I'll keep crazy rants to my blog =D it's best that way. Oh, I better post this before my internet cuts off.. I'll just have to keep editing the stuff..   2nd edit: Oh go me! I just got it published and it cut me off... go me, I'm so clever. Maybe my brain is working after all.. and now I go write in my blog about.. oooo, offer of a nice place to sleeeeeeps! hehehe.
