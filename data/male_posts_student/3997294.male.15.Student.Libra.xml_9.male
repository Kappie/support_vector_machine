They turn back around and use it as a defense for shallowness. This seems to be a concern cuz not known' is not an excuse for those who willin' to learn". John Reuben  Now normally I would not quote John Reuben because he is not my favorite rapper, but this line always strikes something in me. It seems to me that Reuben really hit the thing right on the head with this. Anytime someone tries to stand out and make a difference, they are persecuted for being "Non-conformist" "Rebels" and told to stop trying to change the way things are. You usually hear "we've never done things that way before," but again Reuben has a reply.  to each his own correctin don't select my flavor while see them in the back critiquin' my behavior now tryin' to take creation and me to fit his mold he yelled out sellout but maybe he wasn't told so let me tell this shallow mind why we do what we do I create for the creator but not to impress you ok I'll challenge your thinkin' but not to test you you might not like me, I'll still say "God bless you" and this trust issue, it's all love n' respect and honestly bro I don't think that 's too much to expect but too many times your shallow mind will keep you caught you can't escape your thinkin' all you've ever been taught is that you walk this way you talk this way you front this way you pose this way you react this way na, na that ain't me I got to be who God created me to be  God made me and he made me right. I may not like some of the ways I look, but if I am honest with myself God knows what is best. God made me with a fire inside to not accept the "ordinary" or the "average". He never intended us to all fit in "cookie cutter boxes" and I refuse to submit into what you want me to be. As long as I am pleasing God you can have as much "righteous anger" as you want. Tell me I am "judgmental" "preachy" or that I am going to hell, I know where I'm going. Sometimes people's toes need to be stepped on its whats best for them, in fact some people's toes need to be jumped on. Too many people's eyes and ears don't see or hear the light, because too many "Christian" are worried about offending people. I don't think we need to run around with signs screaming that the world is going to hell, but being afraid to offend someone is the least thing we need to worry about. Myself I've got to be who God created me to be.
