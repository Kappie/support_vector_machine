I believe in opinion and the intergalactic warfare of history discussion days. I believe in dancing like an idiot when nobody’s watching, and taking a shower until the hot water runs out. I believe in remixes and mind-blowing boss fights. I believe that the best books make you cry. I believe in goddesses and leather bucket seats. I believe in caliced fingers, power chords, and the creed that there is a song for every mood you could possibly be in. I believe in Steve Jobs, LAN parties, caffeine overdoses, and Q-Basic. I believe in the controller-s, warthogs flying into the sun, and losing yourself in a fantasy world. I believe in controlling your destiny. I believe in mission trips, the personal faith journey, and building houses made of cinderblocks. I believe in a thing called love. I believe in brotherhood, dreadlocks, and afros. I believe in the power of storytelling, Spike Spiegel, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I believe in my grandmother’s cooking, IBC black cherry sodas, and Skittle-induced vomiting. I believe in the City of Townsville, closing statements, and the almighty teenager. I believe in a raised fist, grinding teeth, and breaking out of jails of all kinds. I believe in making mistakes. I believe that I have a psychic connection to my Volvo. I believe in shrimp and grits, Brixx pizza, Oreo milkshakes, and breaking twenties. I believe in Martha. I believe in speeding and general recklessness. I believe that life is not fair, in the shackles that bind us all, and the ungodly stampede inside of me. I believe in brain-liquefying subwoofers, in the MP3, the digital music revolution, and CityFest Live. I believe in a man’s best friend, a fat cat to keep you warm at night, and a lovebird to sing along with. I believe in laughing at drunk people, doing the worm, and Conker’s Bad Fur Day. I believe in championship games and unforgettable saves. I believe in nervous habits and glued eyeballs. I believe in Kathy Babula. I believe in the rebel without a cause. I believe in the smell of a baseball glove and the feel of a uniform. I believe in the Dead Poet’s Society and nerds of all kinds. I believe in a life lived to the fullest, F5 tornadoes, and rain so hard you could swim in it. I believe that I am intelligent, even wise. I believe in being yourself, in being alive, and being an individual. I believe in adrenaline, head banging, and a rockin’ good time.  I believe in the infinite possibility of an infinite mind.
