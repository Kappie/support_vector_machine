I'm sitting here again (oh, how many hours is it possible for me to just sit ...) in boredom (as usual) and wondering what to write ...  Well, it's not so bad, is it ?  At least I'm making the effort to write something (unlike some people I can think of [cough, cough, cough] ) ... I know what I'm going to tell you !  I'll tell you about the evils of the popular high street trading post known as WH Smith.  Today, I walked casually in to my local (notice that word,  local ) branch, hoping to order a copy of a recently published book.  To my shock, horror and amazement, I was told that the book was unobtainable, due to the fact that  "it's not on our system"  ... I responded with a rant : "terrible service for a national chain !  Amazon is much better !  I can order the same item for their efficient online site (click  urlLink here  to go there [please support those good people as they do a great job !] ) and have it posted directly to me within 3 days !" ... As you can imagine, I left quietly ...  It makes me so angry ... There is no reason whatsoever for them to tell me that it's unobtainable !  If they didn't have monkeys working at the desk ... none of this would have happened !  The day has by no means been wasted, though !  I managed to find great value for money in the form of 30 CD-Rs for an amazingly well spent Â£10 ! (the package also included a free CD pen !)  So, I'm happy !
