After that I went home and slept. Went to work and then went to Dave and Busters with Naomi and Janet to celebrate Naomi's birthday. It was fun. I have a extremely packed next couple of days. Tomorrow, I have class, need to go to do research, and go to the wrestling banquest. Friday I have work. Saturday, I have to go take a look at the stuff I just ordered on interlibrary loan, and see  Face to Face . I need to squeeze in art as mentioned earlier, working out, working on my paper, and maybe swing by Steff's presentation.   Lots to do eh?  ***
