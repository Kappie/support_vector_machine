The book, whose format perfectly matches how Clinton spent most of his time in the White House (hard  covered), was released about a month ago.     Question:   Why does everyone pay so much attention to the outdated Clinton sex scandal and then not care about the current  George W.  White House being full of Bush?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------    The Deal:   Gary Sheffield, New York Yankees right fielder, publicly commented on how the steroids scandal avoids certain players like Roger Clemens, who Sheffield thinks may be out of the scandal’s light just “because he can pitch.” Most baseball-related press attributes Clemens’ longevity in the game to a superior fitness program, but Sheffield doesn’t buy it. "I understand the reason why [Bonds and I are] under suspicion, because of the BALCO issue, but nobody speculates on [other players], on their workout," he explained.    Question:   Why don’t white athletes ever get the cool drug scandals?  urlLink NBA.com  tells us that former  Utah Jazz  star  John Stockton  went from 8.2 to 13.8 assists per game in just one season (from the ’86-’87 season to ’87-’88). You don’t just jump 5 whole assists without some kind of illegal medical enhancement.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------     The Deal:    Colin Farrel , the star of  Phone Booth , recently joked about his penis size in an  Entertainment Weekly  interview. A scene from the upcoming Farrel flick  A Home at the End of the World  featuring his genitalia was cut because a test crowd lost sight of the plot due to Colin’s size. Farrel then commented on how its “nothing to write home about.” He furthered this by describing it as “dark” and “three inches, uh, seconds long.”     Question:   Why does Farrel think he has such a big deal when we all know the man with the longest schlong (below)?
