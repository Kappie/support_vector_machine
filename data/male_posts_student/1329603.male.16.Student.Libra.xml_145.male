But the comment was one more of sarcasm than anything else. Never mind, eh?  As Laura pointed out on her blog, it's 5 days 'til the thingy to Venice takes place. It's 5 days until I have to be really worried about a flight... half of the emotional ties I have'll be on it... meep, it's nicht so fun. Possibility of anything going wrong = minimal. Jon worrying factor = through the roof. Laura, Fi, Zoe, others... don't die... >_  Had the Les Mis practice today, actuellement, while I remember. It was pretty cool, cause we saw Valjean (Phil) hold an A for about 3 bars. Which makes him a git for being able to but he's pretty amazing at his high range. He doesn't really have anything low-wise though, so bwahaha. My range surpasses his, he's just higher. Git. But we did the wedding scene, where I have to amble a waltz with Cosette (Naomi), who is 5'2". So, waltzing with an 8" difference. Woohoo. No, but Naomi's pretty cool, and she's as bad as I am at waltzing so we kind of go alright there. It's quite fun doing t'old waltz with my wife. Everyone appeared to be shocked that I knew my lines for the wedding. I pointed out that we had done it once before, and that meant that I pretty much knew everyone's lines for that bit cause I'm good at picking things up. And not smug about it. Noo... we also did A Heart Full of Love, which is faster than I thought, but quite nice, and really cool to hear it working. I guess I use 'working' loosely, the biggest problem being that Naomi's lack of range means I have to do a falsetto Bb instead of her going to the one an octave above that. Which is a bit of an argh, I guess. But still, Eponine (Olivia) is a pretty fantastic singer, so looking forward to Wednesday when we do A Little Fall of Rain. It's a very sad song but it's a nice song. i_i.  Fi's not blogg√®d for a bit... lame. Blog, Fi, blog! Blog! Fi, blogggg!!!!!  Anyway, must stop rambling. Ciao!  Quote of the day: "Then it's true... then... I'm right... Jean Valjean was my saviour that night! As for you... take this too! God, forgive us the things that we do! Come, my love, come, Cosette, This day's blessings are not over yet...!"  From   The Wedding   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
