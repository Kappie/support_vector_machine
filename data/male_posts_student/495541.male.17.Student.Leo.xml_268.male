FreeCell isn't exactly multiplayer, but we just played the same game on our computers and she kicked my butt.  I don't have much practice in FreeCell... shrug.  I'm listening to "On the Sunny Side of the Street" right now.  It's a great song.  It's cooler when Dizzy starts to sing at the end.  I don't have anything else to type.  Thanks for reading and good night.
