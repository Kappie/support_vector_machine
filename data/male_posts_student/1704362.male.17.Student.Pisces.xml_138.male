Lucid dreaming changes the dream experience into something more like being a god.   Essentially, a lucid dream is achieved when one realizes that they are dreaming within the dream, but do not wake up. This allows the dreamer to take control of his or her "dream world" or "dreamscape." A major road block on my journey to lucid dreaming is my horrible memory, especially related to dreams. I'm getting better, though.   There are lots of strategies for training yourself to stay lucid in dreams, the one I'm trying now is to associate a symbol with the fact that I'm dreaming. I've also learned apparently hands become distorted or fuzzy in dreams, along with the fact that writing often changes  - so I thought of this little trick:      wow, my hands are hot     If I happen to glance at my hands in my dreams, I'm hoping that I'll notice that this is changed or gone completely.  If you've been reading any of my "serious" posting recently, you'd probably get the feeling that I don't know myself very well, psychologically speaking. I've also been feeling a bit impotent (still psychologically speaking, assholes) - that none of my decisions matter, that I can't even make decisions into the first place. So, what better method to achieve self-understanding and control of my life than physically exploring and taking control of my own subconscious mind?
