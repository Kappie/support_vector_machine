Means she does not automatically satisfy the normal entrance requirements and had to go through this panel.. And i rushed down to open my letter box, and guess what.. me too. damn it.  So now, i have to send in watever rubbish documents i have to support my application. Im feeling damn sad now, my fingers crossing doesnt work at all... Hope the admissions panel will accept me! PLEASE!!   Current Mood: DISAPPOINTED
