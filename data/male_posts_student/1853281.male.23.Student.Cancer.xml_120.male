It has not been much of a problem,  never liked milk and yoghurt is good, but also not always my thing. But, cheese is so a different story. I love cheese, a lot. A Lot. But no more for me, i am tired of being ill all the time, and since i have been avoiding cheese as well as other dairy i feel much better.  Have stopped eating meat as well, just does not seem to agree with me. I do like it though, but again, tired of feeling ill.  So i guess i have turned vegan, though not for the reasons every other vegani know did. I still wear leather without feeling like a hypocrite. I don't have moral qualms about eating animal products. In fact, I probably still will from time to time, but healthwise for me it seems to be best to avoid them. More's the pity. Has not been too difficult though, albeit i haven't been eating out much, that might get tiresome, but most of my cooking was pretty Vegan as it was so that was not a drastic change. Not sure what to call myself now, I am sure I will slip and eat animal stuff every once in a while, and i won't feel guilty, so no really big moral reason to avoid it. But, that makes me not a Vegan? Part time Vegan? Predominantly Vegan? What?
