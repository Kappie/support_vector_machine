I can safely assume that I now know what Lord Cardigan went through during the charge of the Light Brigade, when he bravely led about 600 British troops right into the paths of three different Russian cannons much to the dismay of Lord Raglan. The order to march right into those cannons was apparently never issued, and much of the Light Brigade were massacred. In my case, I haven’t the faintest idea what I am doing most of the time ( or what I’m supposed to be doing anyway ), but I still go along as if I bought the whole outfit.  Mwah ha ha ! That’s me! I live by the principles: act smart even though you ain't that bright. And yet, for some reason or the other, I do not feel the need to “educate” myself. To unlose myself from this maze. To work harder so I finally understand these confounded things. Instead, I find myself getting totally engrossed in a spectacular 125cc race in which the tussle for the lead involved six bikes. I find myself rooting for Greece in the Euro 2004 Finals as if it was my country. I find myself having fun bashing people up all day. It hasn’t really helped to find that I had an accumulated points total of more than 30 in my recent exams ( boosted by a 9G for my Add Maths – don’t ask me how I managed to do that ). If I manage to reproduce that sensational form for my SPM exams, let’s just safely assume that I won’t be top of the list for admission into the University of Skopje – let alone University Malaya. Well, can’t be perfect. As my good friend Andre Benjamin once said ( or sang ), “But mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time, and the other half either got you cursed out or coming up short.” Sarcasm aside, I know I have to buck up. I know I have to work. I know have to put away the urge of staying up nights to watch A.J. Foyt IV lose control on Turn 4 and narrowly miss smashing into Sarah Fischer. I know I have to stop my fingers from double-clicking the enticing gun icon on my desktop. I have to stop plotting my next move in a bid to unseat Celtic from the Scottish Premiership using some obscure team like Partick Thistle or Dundee United. Aaahhh! The temptations of life... And will some kind hearted Hollywood director come up with a good war movie soon? I’m getting fits just thinking about the lack of action! This year, the only thing I’ve seen which comes close to a GOOD war flick is some silly movie in which a dude charged straight at a whole platoon of Germans armed with mortars and machine guns with a flame thrower. And unlike the poor Light Brigade, this guy actually made it through. Heavens! You’d think the director would have a sense of reality to accompany his obviously magnificent imagination.
