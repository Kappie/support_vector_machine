He's like me, but artistic, and far funnier and he doesn't even look like he's thirty.  It's great stuff, and not to mention the show.  It really showed all these things I'd never even heard of from Tv's past, and put together you really realize how racist American TV has been and still is.  It really struck me painful to see how black people are treated as undesirable on reality shows.  Like Real World LA (1993), they kicked the black guy out because they didn't feel safe.   Holy God.  I hadn't even realized the thing that white America does to Asian women and Latinas on TV.  It overly sexifies them, after watching Allie McBeal I'd figure most Asian women are the ultra-sexy dragon ladies, and all latinas are horny sex machines who are overly open about everything to do with sex, I can't honestly say if I openly know if Latino culture is more open about sex then say, black people (we really aren't open about it though.... okay nevermind), but the thing is how the males are portrayed in turn.  Latino males are portrayed as usually being silly, sly, seductive or drunk/high.  While Asian men, oh lord.  Find me a show that actually uses real asian men that aren't short, buck toothed, with the coke bottle glasses, an insane accent for being American, or something along those lines.  Crazy stuff, but the show was amazing, I have it recorded.  Yeah, so it's all going well.  Went driving lessoning yesterday.  It got insanely easy in the course of 10 minutes after I pulled off.  Infact, it was hard not to speed it was so easy.  I still have one more lesson on sunday, so I should have my permit (finally) in a week.  Oh, and Nangila poetry reading.  Marcus jumped at the chance to read at it when I told him about it.  I swear this dudes eyes lit up.  It was some good stuff.  It seems like it'll blow over pretty well, I just need to meet the fellow people in this organization.
