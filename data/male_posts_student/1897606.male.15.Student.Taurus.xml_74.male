I got home from the party and watched the Chiefs...pretty good game. Then I wrote a half-assed letter to "God" and went to confirmation...what a fucking waste of time. So I get home and my friends invite me to the movies but I couldn't go because I'm a poor fuck. So shit, I'll just sit at home and cry.
