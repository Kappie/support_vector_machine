I prefer the latter cause wala lang...I just feel like doing so...And I can watch spiderman 2 with my people naman sa weekends...  The day of our long test in math was moved, thank God! Well, it means I have more time to review and focus on Limits...still, proving using epsilon-delta is sorta not my stuff...I'd rather compute...anyway, the fact is it is moved...  doc mara will be leaving over the week end and our class is assured of two mara-free weeks...well, we will still have classes but under one of his "colleagues"...hehehe  well, its filipino again tomorrow and I try my best (just as last time) not to sleep in front of Joseph Salazar...I do hope I succeed this time...  anyway, I still have to read some stuff in Hulagpos and go to Schmitt for Math 21...so bye!   Mwah!
