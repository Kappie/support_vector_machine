Besides the fact that Africans haven't ever got around to speaking the same 200 languages, I almost freaked out then, but she refuses to see it's actually English (Gullah I'm almost positive).  She can't notice the similarities between Come by Here, and Kum Ba Yah.   I mean.... Dios!  Come--> Kum, stressing the vowel oddly.  Ba --> Dropping the "Y" sound infavor of using it in the next word (even though some people say Bay-yah), and Yah although it doesn't sound like hear, it's imaginable in speak.  'ts right ova yah.    Whatever.... I don't get out enough.  Every other journal in existence is usually about people going out and doing stuff... no not me.  I'm a little Computer boy, who would become a shriveled husk without the net.  I seriously should have gone to Jamnesty yesterday.
