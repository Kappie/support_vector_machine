Perry's makin us go to goddam blists hill so we can draw stuff...boring... then later in the week, we got goddam sports day, then to top it all, we're not going to a theme park this year. Goddam it. Sports day is so crappy. The school makes everyone do it and for what, humiliation. That's what. We don't raise any money for anyone, not even the school and no one watches it apart from the whole school. People's social lives (including mine probably) are at risk for the sake of some crappy school event. }:( I feel sick just thinking about it. They're going to have to drag me if they want me to do anything at all, and I'm not bringing my kit. I don't care how severely punished I get, I'm not doing anything. I hope they've got some reserves. The art trips'll be alright, apart from the London one which we have to be at school for 7:30am and will arrive back at 9:00pm (or something like that.) I think I'll just go and slit my wrists a few hundred times and hang myself and shoot myself and decapetate myself and walk heavy-footedley into a 1,000,000 acre minefeild, then off a cliff into the icy sea with lazor guided sharks with drills for teeth in it and freeze and drown and fall into a coffin and get buried alive and get eaten by maggots and then be reborn as a fly and get squashed by a gay guy, dressed in just an apron.   v. pissed off
