So, without any further time wasting, my first subject: Happy Returns.  Beautiful has returned! Arriving at 1:05 on Friday, I picked Beautiful up and we had quite the adventure! After getting her bag, which was packed tight enough that we had to handle with care, rather we blast the nearby people with clothing, we headed to what I will simply refer to as the Can. The Can is my truck: a silver 1991 GMC side-step...or step-side...I don't know cars! Either way, the Can is not a very...reliable source of transportation, considering the AC has gone out on it twice, the gas gauge seems to randomly decide when to work, and the CD player is an absolute piece. OK, I know the CD thing isn't a "major" thing to most people, but if you didn't notice by "The Sound of Music", its a big deal to me.  I might as well talk about this now, the Can actually looks much more like the junker I consider it to be since I recently had an...accident in it. I've told this story about 30 times to various people who always say the EXACT SAME THING. "What happened to your truck?"  I realize this is the most obvious question to ask when there's a rather large and oddly shaped dent on the front left quarter panel, but it is a pretty annoying question. So, I look at them, and tell the story I'm going to tell now. There's an S shaped curve near where Beautiful lives and as I was heading home one night on it, it was raining very hard. As I took the last part of the curve, the back end of the truck began to slide! Being the quick-thinking individual I am, I effectively turned into the swerve. Which would have straightened the truck out and I would have been fine. But, as my luck goes, I ALSO reached up to slam the brake...which is a no-no when your car/truck is sliding. The best part is, however, that my foot edged the brake, and slammed down on the accelerator! That's all I remember, except for the sound as my truck slammed into a 50-pound sand filled barrel. Lots of fun.  Skip about 2 months later, to the airport. On the way there, I'd noticed that the gas gauge said it was empty. But this was crazy, because I only had 107 miles on the tank! It would later turn out that the genius who fixed my AC for the second time hit the button that resets the mile counter. Either way, as we approached Beautiful's home, my truck died. At an intersection. With a huge Mac truck behind me. Oh, the fun. The best part was that there was a gas station DIRECTLY ACROSS THE INTERSECTION, but trying to drive on fumes just wouldn't do it and I was effectively stopped right there. So, I got out, and asked Beautiful to steer the Can once the light turned green. I was going to push the Can up, onto the street, and across the intersection whether it was in the way of other people or not. This proved to...not work. The Can had to roll UP a rather large bump before it could get into the street...and it apparently didn't feel like it. So there I was, with my truck stuck at an intersection with about 5 cars lined up behind me, all of them having to wait through an entire green light to watch me weakly push a truck about half a foot, to have it roll right back into the starting position. It was probably entertaining, but they no doubt had somewhere to be.  Then, entered the Good Samaritan. The Good Samaritan in this case was a guy who resembled the classic stereotype of a smoker. Dark sunglasses, messy clothes and a sort of twitchy motion, all mixed in with a voice that told a story of its own. Either way, the Good Samaritan walked over, and hopped behind the Can. I thanked him before we even started pushing, and we were off! With his help, we were on our way...and then the light turned red again. It probably changed green again as we pushed the Can through the extremely bumpy intersection. We finally got across, and we were able to put some fuel in the Can, which was more than enough to get us to Beatiful's house. Her return was even more wonderful than I'd anticipated, and that night was made even better by dinner with Beautiful and her family that night!  Now, onto the next subject: Moral Question. The band, CrossFire, has officially changed its name. Wanting something a little cooler, and a little Latin, the band is now known as "Tri-Septum", meaning 3 Sevens in Latin. Why? Well, its a simple play off the Number of the Beast, 666. Either way, the band got together and we discussed many things, and among this discussion was the subject of songs. We attempted to write a couple of songs together, but it was quickly discovered that it wasn't going to work, so we went on to other things. The next night, the same night Beautiful returned, I was hit by a bus-load of inspiration and I wrote an entire song in 10 minutes. The thing that worries me is the song is...rather "edgy". And by that I mean dark. And harsh. The song also questions the United State Government and its morals, so I consider this to be a rather difficult Moral Question. The song discusses an event known as the Firebombing of Dresden. During WWII, the US firebombed this city, killing approximately 20 thousand civilians. This German city contained almost no soldiers, and the ones there were guarding OUR P.O.W.s. I have issues with this occurrence, and that's what the song is about. I just hope my church doesn't mind...Eh... Well, I'll just post the song and people can post their thoughts. Keep in mind that the song is written for a metal band, so the lyrics are supposed to be rather...dark.   Forgive Us  Give the command with no thought Giving the innocent all you've got Never ask the public, ignore you subjects Crush them like they're mere objects! Fan the flames to burn out life Might as well kill a man's kids as you slay his wife!!!  (Chorus) We don't want any more blood stains to our name We don't want any more pain 	X3  Take out your own as you wipe away the guiltless Never was there a move more spineless! Now you ride through the sky Its time to make the few survivors die! Is this the way you fight a fair war? How can you look at your kids anymore?!?!  (Chorus) 	 Everyone acts like this incident never occurred They choose to believe the state's written word Evil is never necessary, no matter the gain It all comes back to Abel and Cain But the Truth is the Truth no matter the spin And thousands of children are lifeless because of our sin!!!  (Chorus)  God, forgive us for Dresden! X10   And for the final subject: Karmic Luck. Considering the size of this post, I'm sure you're glad to see the final subject is up. I promise this will be quick. I'm really just basking in my own luck. I arrived home tonight about 10 minutes past curfew and I knew that I would receive a MAJOR thrashing from the parents...Imagine my delighted surprise when I discovered that they were still out! So, I slipped under their parental radar and was *not* late...nice.
