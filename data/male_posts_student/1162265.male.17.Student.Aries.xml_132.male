The author of Proposition 209, the statewide initiative voters passed in 1996 banning affirmative action in state institutions, Connerly says “race is irrelevant.”   Proposition 54 is the number assigned Monday to the new measure. It will appear on the ballot in just a little over two months, on Oct. 7, along with the questions of whether Gov. Gray Davis should be recalled and who should replace him.   Connerly, an African American former University of California official and his organization, the American Civil Rights Institute, has spent nearly $2 million to garner the needed signatures to place the initiative on a statewide ballot to be decided on by the voters. The initiative would prohibit state, county and local government agencies from asking about race on all forms and documents, including statistics on hate crimes, health care, education, the judicial system and others.   “This state has become increasingly diverse but also has huge economical, educational and health disparities - which we know about because we have the data. With this initiative, we would not have that data,” said Maria Blanca, national senior counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF).   The most populous state in the nation, California is also to the most diverse, recently becoming predominately non-white, according to the 2000 census.   Blanca and other opponents of the initiative gathered at a forum hosted by New California Media, a coalition of ethnic media agencies, at the San Francisco Commonwealth Club. The participants represented various fields that would be affected by the pending proposition: schools, hospitals, researchers, law enforcement and more.   “African American and Latino youth are more likely to be sent to state correctional institutions than white youth for the same crime, and in San Francisco, Black students are four times more likely to be suspended and expelled than white students,” said Maya Harris West, project director for the ACLU’s Racial Project.   In Alameda County, with Oakland as its major city, Blacks make up just 17 percent of the overall population, but Blacks make up a startling 70 percent of the incarcerated youth, according to recent study by Huskey  Associates. Such data would be illegal to collect in Connerly’s colorblind state.   “State agencies responsible for enforcing Civil Rights would be prohibited from collecting data on race - what sense does that make,” asked Ted Wang, executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action.   The disparities in the state, which are similar throughout the country, are glaring for Blacks: AIDS rates, incarceration rates, school dropout rates, poverty rates and many others show that Blacks face a much harsher reality than most other people.   “African Americans have the highest rate of infant mortality in the state. But if this initiative passed, we would know that infant mortality was 5.4 per 1,000 infants in the state, but we would not know that for African Americans it is more than double - 12.8 per 1,000,” said Vivian Huang, senior policy analyst for California Primary Care Association.   “They create the environment that produces these deplorable conditions for Blacks then outlaw the ability to document, make public and expose the condition,” said Martin Jacks, founder of The Mentoring Center, an organization that serves incarcerated youth and relies on data that charts disproportionate incarceration rates for Blacks.   With Latinos surpassing Blacks as the largest ethnic group in the country and soon to be the majority population in the state, Connerly says Latinos should not benefit from Affirmative Action   Connerly told the Washington Post, Latinos “want to see affirmative action policies remain so they can take advantage of them. They want to claim minority status when, in fact, they will soon be a majority in California.”   “Here is a man claiming to be colorblind but is fanning the flames of racial divisiveness,” said Blanca.
