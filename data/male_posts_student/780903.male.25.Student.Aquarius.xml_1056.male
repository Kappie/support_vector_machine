Anyone who might be interested in writing a regular (or irregular) column in The Record newspaper next year, about anything (or nothing at all) including 3Ls who may be interested in writing, pseudonymously or not, about their post-graduation lives and jobs (I think this could be really cool if I could find people willing to contribute), and including 1Ls-to-be who might want to write about 1L life, send me an e-mail.  2. Any 1Ls or 2Ls (or 1Ls-to-be) who want to get involved in the Parody Show writing process, send me an e-mail.  We've got a Yahoo group going where we're going to try and get input/ideas/jokes/etc from throughout the law school.  A whole continuum of possibilities to be involved, from just contributing some names and stories to really trying to help us write the script.  /end of solicitation
