Currently I do not feel led to pursue full time ministry, so that leaves me five career paths to think about.  I recognize that many very happy and successful people do not work in the field they studied in college, but as a rising high school senior I'm going to ignore this and view my future career in the context of undergraduate college  In this context, I see electrical engineering as a possible undergraduate major for four of the five principal career paths. If I major in electrical engineering I have the potential to go into business/entrepreneurship or even attend business school after working for a few years; I could pursue an engineering/technical/science job; I could teach high school (or college if I get a Ph.D which I don't want to do at the moment); or I could go to law school and become a lawyer of some kind, possibly but not necessarily a patent lawyer. I recognize that it's very difficult to get good grades as an engineering major--not that I scoff at those who get good grades in the social sciences and humanities--but, for the time being, in my pretension I wto assume that I can do well enough to get into a reasonably good law school, teacher college, business school, or get a Ph.D, or get a job in engineering/science after college.  The problem is that none of the aforementioned four career paths is tremendously appealing to me--businessmen are too greedy for me, engineers are tomorrow's textile and steelworkers; teachers get paid almost nothing (I'm shallow) and have to do the same thing over and over again; most lawyers don't contribute anything to society and those who do get paid nothing; and being a professor is incredibly stressful because of the pressure to publish papers. Also, none of the above jobs are very secure.   So then I look toward the health sciences. I see basically three jobs in the health sciences that I would want to have: medical doctor (D.O. or M.D.)--anything but surgeon (I dislike blood) or obstetrician/gynecologist (I'm not a woman and don't like insurance companies); pharmacist; and optometrist. In all three fields, I would be helping other people, would have reasonable job security (just you try to export that yearly checkup to India), and would be making a comfortable, even decadent wage. I am deeply ambivalent about bioengineering and pharmacology because I don't like the idea of personally testing drugs on animals, and it seems like those fields could require frequent 80 hour weeks. I also wouldn't want to be a dentist.  Based on my very limited research in the health professions, I know that schools of medicine, osteopathy, pharmacy, and optometry are unbelieveably hard to get into and require people to take many biology and chemistry classes. From anecdotes, I know that said science classes are highly competitive and that premedical/prepharmaceutical/preoptometric students are notorious for being cutthroat and stressed out. Also from anecdotes, I know that medical/osteopathy school (and probably pharmacy and optometry school) and the few years of residency/intership are unbelieveably hard, depressing, and filled with sleepless nights. My dislike of blood and gore might make medical/osteopathy school in particular very unpleasant for me. However, being a doctor would probably be the most rewarding career among the three health science professions I have enumerated, both monetarily and emotionally, assuming I didn't work in an emergency trauma ward or something like that.   But here's the rub: if I set myself up on the premed/prepharm/preoptometry track and take all those unbelieveably hard science classes, and don't do quite well enough to get into med/pharm/opt school, I end up a teacher. However, I'm not a disgrace to the family because my parents at least pretend not to care about social class and say that whatever I do they're happy (all my non-nuclear family relatives are either estranged or dead so I don't care about them, either).  So here's one potential solution: study electrical engineering in undergrad while doing all the necessary premed/prepharm/preopt classes. This does two things: first, it makes my four years of college a living hell and probably makes it five years of college; second, it makes my grades so bad that I'm unemployable as an engineer, incapable of getting into law, business, or medical school; third, it wastes a lot of college money; and fourth, I end up as a teacher not in the district of my choice (a wealthy one that treats its teachers right like PAUSD, FUHSD, or LAMVHSD), but rather in a bad district (I'm an elitist racist) like Ravenswood, where teachers get threatened at knifepoint. Also, doing this would make it very hard to get a broad liberal education in college, which I see as intrinsically valuable. Of course, this is a cariacature and I'm sure that some people have successfully done premed while majoring in EE, but the worry is still in my mind.  The only way to even try to avoid the aforementioned worst-case scenario if I do choose to do EE with premed is to go to a college with "easy" classes, which means no U.C. Berkeley (in my pretension I assume that I will get into U.C. Berkeley electrical engineering, perhaps the most prestigious and difficult engineering program in the world.)  I pray about this broadly every day--I ask God to show me what to do with my future. I will continue to pray about this, and I have faith that God will guide me, and probably make me a really good solution that I couldn't possibly have thought of before.
