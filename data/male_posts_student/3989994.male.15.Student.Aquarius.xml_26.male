I ask you to remove all those who would leave the moment you were not cool anymore or when you leave school. True friendship is really rare, when you come across it, treasure it never let it go. A friendship that is truly stong is likened to love, you care for that person so much it would hurt you to see that person fail, yet it would bring you to your hearts end when they triumph!  It  is never about what you could do together but it is about what you do for yourself because you know whatever it is you are going to do would be good for the both of you, and that you can count on the other person to support you.  Even when you both are competing secretly you wish the other could also win. A true friendship is something that is eternal, it need not be long it need not be wordy, it is something that would last forever a imprint into your life that you treasure.  I can say that i have only met two people with whom i share this love for, and this is dedicated to the future head.  Thank you for what you have done for me, I appreciate it alot more than it may seam, from the way a smile touches the tips of your lips when you smile to the time you sweard in seondty two. "f...... sh.." haha.  With love forever and best wishes, Your friend
