I remember gautam telling me that once, even writing that in my slam book ... but somehow on the way to a more professional life i had left it on the way somewhere .... but today morning i decided to be optimistic in life again ... wanted to look upto things the way i want to see them not the way the world makes me see them, beleive me it helps. Coz today morning I heard myself saying that today is going to be one of the best days of my life ... well dont know abt that but had a great day indeed. Rest aside, I am going to switzerland .... there is a whole list of people i need to thank for the same, the first and foremost being avantika who took the pains to sit on my essay for whatever time it took her to revise the entire thing from top to bottom (and the number of hrs surely exceeds 24) atleast i could have had had never ever come up with such a fantastic piece. prob it was the essay only that made them choose me besides salil since salil has a higher cg, somewhat better cv and overall had put in more effort that me, or maybe i dont know about it so should not comment. The idea is that they were to take only 1 from each insti, from our insti they took 2 so .... and .... and nothing else .... oops continuing on the list of people i need to thank includes Manjari (of course yes!), Sameer Singhdeo, and Sameer Lal for telling me that i cant write good poetry, Ms. Neerja Pande coz had it not been her I shall have had had sent a totally rotten essay to those guys ... What else, hmm lemme think .... i dont know, i am too excited about it  Somehow i like the idea of blogging, gives u a good way to express your own self. The day is going to be hectic ahead so wanted to live this moment all by my own self. Am going to delhi to meet a very very old [FEMALE] friend Supriti .... lets see how the thing comes up to be .... what else strat man presentation tomorrow and a lot lot lot of work to do for the same.  Chalo signing of on a more optimistic note !
