Pride comes before a fall and I've fallen and I don't intend to fall anymore. I'm not going to quit or run or whatever you wanna call it. I'm going to become closer to my Lord and He will guide me in his light coz I've decided that that's the way I want to live my life.  I'm going to have to loose my pride, or simply retain less of what I have now because it simply won't do me any good. It was my pride that caused me to defend myself against what Keith said, it was my pride that made me stay in the LT, it was my pride that picked me up to take him down, it was my pride which questioned him outside the LT and it was my pride that told the teacher that we'd go to the office. There was nothing wrong in going to the office, but the tone in which I did it was erroneous. You think I'm being too harsh and picky? Yes and No. But I want to change, so this is how it'll have to be. Let it not be said not understood that ACJC tore me down, but let it be known that ACJC made me stronger. Yes, a stronger man.  As for what happened with Mrs Wilson, I have chosen to take a lower standpoint though I still feel that injustice was done. This is how I'm going to see it. I shouldn't have written about the school like that, because if I want to be a leader in the school, I'm going to have to love it. And if I'm going to represent the country with the school, I'm going to have to love my country. I watched my tone and the way I spoke to her and am pleased at how I carried myself. Didn't burst or anything.  I'm going to fight to turn this around. People are going to see me loving and they'll think, wasn't that the Timothy that was prideful? I'm going to let Jesus's light and love shine in me. And I'm going to fight to turn impressions around. I need to lah, coz if I don't I won't have much of a chance at leadership anymore. I don't believe that there is anything wrong in expressing my ambition but I do believe that I have to have the right intentions. My intention, in all honesty was not for power or popularity, but to prove that Fairsians could do it too. And I've always known that leadership was servanthood. Pride clouded that for a while but that's being blown away now. You'll see, just you wait. And even if I don't make it, I'll shine for Jesus no matter what. (After a long period of being very moody and all)  I have decided to remain in ACJC for several reasons. 1) I'm going to face and tackle my problem head on by tackling myself. 2) I'm going to be able to benefit from one of the best arts streams around. 3) I'm going to learn alot from one of the best choirs around. 4) I'm going to experience what the real world is like and how to deal with difficult people, which also means learning to deal with the way I handle people. 5) I have got a few good friends with whom I can really relate to without the fear of being looked at differently.  I miss talking to Leon and Desiree. Must admit that I was disappointed at some of the reasons that muscles gave to me stay, but that's gone, he's got emotions too. Granted. I still love him. Good man he is. Really admire the way he handles things sometimes.  Walked Dawn home today. We talked about lots of things, about favorite places and walking on roof-tops. About children and dogs and lots more that's between the both of us. She's nice and all and faces almost similar problems as I. She even lives on a hill near me with a little park nearby. Sound familiar? Oddly so, but I pray that you, reading this, get no interpretation that swings wildly in your imagination. She may be wildly intellectual and pretty, but she's also a friend.  It's getting lengthy and I have a LOT of homework to do. Good night. Starting again.
