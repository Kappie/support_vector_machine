That's a song you can keep listening to without getting sick of. Ok, so today, nothing in school. Just hurt my back a little moving the wrong way, yea I'm weak and old. I think it's because of the heavy backpacks we have to carry around. Also because I never exercise, well I do...just rarely but if drums count that means I'm always exercising. I took a nap after school. Later I drummed, had Chinese food and watched Finding Nemo with my mom. It would be better watching it with my dad. It's kind of a movie to make dad and son love each other. Not that I don't already. But it's a happy movie and I see me as Nemo and father fish as my dad and then I think I should listen to my Dad more often and respect him more. I try my hard. I should try my hardest. Ok that's all. As James says, "BAI."
