It was... um... well ok... of course it's an old movie. 62 years old to be exact, so the acting was the typical melodramatic fare of the era. Actually the cheesy acting is like what they were poking fun at in  Pleasantville . American popular media was in an interest state of ups and downs in self censorship up until relatively recently. Anyway, the  Maltese Falcon  is supposed to be one of the earliest "fim noir" films, and perhaps the first "film noir" detective flick. What makes it "film noir?" Well the rough edged hero is one aspect, as well as the generally darker mood. That's something you start to feel once you get past the hokiness of the acting from the era. Sam Spade is rough. He doesn't show emotion and sometimes you wonder what his intentions are. I think that's what makes him cool. I also dug the movie, because of all the spoofs that have come from it. Quest for Glory and Animaniacs being some. I enjoyed it... but it's not exactly my favorite old movie. I think I'm gonna try to rent more old movies.  So today I managed to do some reading in Economies of Sign and Space and on city planning. Interesting stuff. At least I got some productivity in right?  Feeling quite tired... I think that's what junk food does to ya...  ***
