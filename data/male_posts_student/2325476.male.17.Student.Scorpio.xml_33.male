You can use it to buy more stuff to fill some void in your life, you can use it to learn about the latest breaking events that don't affect you at all... you can use it to fulfill your lustiest fantasies, but in all, the internet is truly worthless.     It is an invention of man that has no immediate purpose, and as such, man feels the need to try and make a purpose for it.    Then it hit me... how incredibly fucking much of the state of all human affairs in the world would fall into that category? The stock exchange, politics, television, all useless entities made and used to perpetuate the use of other useless entities. (ugh, my ideas on the matter are now coming into my head so fast that I'm having trouble forming them into sentences before they're gone and new ones are there) I am thoroughly convinced that the end of our world will be brought about in no small part by said entities.   Why are there atomic bombs? To kill our enemies. Why do we have enemies? Because they have different ideas and opinions than us. Why do we need ideas and opinions?  If not for the formation of economies and governments, the US wouldn't be anti-communist, there would've been no cold war, no arms race, obtaining nuclear weapons wouldn't be a priority- no, a prerequisite to being a world power, and the name Kim Jong Il wouldn't be of any concern to anyone. Communication and interaction are of the utmost importance... in SMALL communities. Has anyone ever stopped to think maybe there's such a thing as too much interaction? First, why should we worry about the lives of people we will never meet, and second, why should we try and exert some kind of power over them?  What's the big deal about Korea? They're communists with nukes. So? So their method of existence affects the international system or trading useless entities created by man for the sole purpose of furthering the use of other useless entities.   Enough to make your head spin, no?  So why does man feel the need to create these kinds of things? Probably to fill some kind of void. I personally would say that humans are frightened of not being able to create and destroy, of not having something for which they can be the alpha and the omega. We have a superiority complex, and feel a void that we try to assuage by creating the illusion of power. In truth, that void is filled by surrendering our notions of power, and succumbing to the cosmic greatness of what is and what's to be. For all us human beings in the world, there sure aren't many of us who see the beauty and find the vast serenity and contentment that exists in  simply being .
