In fact, he gets to be the first asshole featured on my bLog for bad driving (at least the first one I can identify!)  It was a dump truck. Blue. License plate 758 8EV. Name of Den Rick painted on the side. Where ever you are sir, I hope you're having a bad bad day.  So I'm going to sit down and play some Metroid in a bit - we don't have a cycle count this morning, so I get to relax.
