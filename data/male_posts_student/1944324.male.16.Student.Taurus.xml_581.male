So now we're $300 dollars in the hole, but I have 2 new pairs of shorts and Lounge Pants! I was stuck between two pairs, one covered with smileys and a pair of mario-print pants. The extreme yellow and the power of smileys was tough to pass up, but the sheer novelty of Mario won me over. I get my license now!    Is that a rocket you've got hidden there?  No, it's my cookie.
