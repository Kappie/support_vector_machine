Rest all I wrote was rubbish….yes!! rubbish And well this was also long I named Rishi Dhaul(the only other guy in music) as Rishipal.. It was fun, it sounds like somebody’s driver’s name.. lol Ohk then, well the teacher also thought that his name was Rishipal and well said, “Pal chup karke bhaet jao, nahin to I will minus 10” it was so damn funny and also my friend Rishipal did not know anything so he kept looking here and there, asking for answers. At once, he was looking into my paper and I said, aloud, “Rishipallll(Punjabi accent), agge dekh yaar(look forward)”. This was also damn funny Nothing else that was interesting happened Oh I almost forgot There was a bat hanging in our block today..yes, my friends a bat…. The ones who make funny noises while traveling So everybody started throwing stuff at it and it started moving like a pendulum And we were all so scared…(scared? my ass!!) Ppl can u help me? I had a fight with my friend and now I don’t know how to solve it, we guys just have too many differences That’s kinda it Also my friend  urlLink Karan Misra , has posted an entry on masturbation which is good... you ppl should read it Ciao
