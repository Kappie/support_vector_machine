I am a very emotional person.  This may or may not be a suprise to those who know me.  I am sure there are those of my friends who realize that I am very emotional and even know that my emotions can switch in an instant and be extremely intense.  I think the Doc very well could have been right when he said he thought I may be bi-polar.  I am sure I have ADD to a degree as well.  BUT, this is my main revelation ... I control my emotions and mind extremely well ... until I get sick.  I found myself overwhelmed with emotions on several occasions while I was sick.  It took every ounce of control I had left not to cry over stupid things.  I found myself starting to get actually angry (something that almost never happens) when I heard about injustices to my friends.  I mean I always get indignant when I hear about injustice to my friends ... but this was more .. it was a raw anger .. the dangerous kind.  I had to tell my friend to stop talking about it becuase I was afraid I may actually loose my contol over it.  I don't even realize the power of the emotions I have when I am not sick becuase I just keep them solidly under lock and key.  I realize they are there, but I rule them not the other way around.  That resolve and control breaks down more and more the worse I feel.  When I don't feel well it's not the time to joke with me ... not the time to give me a hard time ... not the time to prod me or try to find my limits.  When I am well, it takes extreme things to upset me much and people get used to nothing bothering me.  That is the way I like to be, but sometimes it just happens differently.
