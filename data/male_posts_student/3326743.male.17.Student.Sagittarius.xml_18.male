I think we're going down to Greenville but I think we're just going to be finishing stuff up around the house and then coming back up to pick my sister up at the airport.... which isn't cool because that means I miss the Bible Study, Genna's party, and I probably won't even get to see Laura.  Grr...  But that's okay, I mean it's in the Lord's hands right.   I just can't decide what's right; 'cause it's my last week of vacation, and my dad wants to spend some time with me (only he doesn't really have time to spend), but it's also my  last week  of summer vacation and I'd like to do some things with my friends. (i.e. Bible study, genna's party, Daniel's party, etc.)  Well I think I finished my fourth 'song' today... not really finished I suppose but I'm reasonably happy with the melody.  I'm recording  them into the word document on my PDA, so it's pretty cool, like the words are right there and then there's a voice clip of me singing the melody.  It sounds bad for obvious reasons.. =) But hey, make a joyful noise!  It's really great, I think I'm gonna start working a lot more seriously on writing songs.  It's such an awesome release for all the praises I have for God... I'm bad at it but by His grace I'll improve.  The only problem is that there's not enough time in the day to write down everything I want to or sing half the melodies I think of... but that's okay.  Well I have to go I got a thirty dollar over draft on my checking account when there should have been funds there so I'm gonna go call Wachovia.  God bless.
