The relevant Seinfeld episode popped into my head for some reason, and the phrase just sort of came together. I realized I had to assign it to someone, and if not you, then who? If you think about it, it's sort of a compliment. You know, "Wonder," etc., and who doesn't love a monkey, am I right?   In the interest of fairness, I'll let you decide how you want "Wonder" and "Monkey" spelled. "Coco" is non-negotiable.   Peace out, Coco.
