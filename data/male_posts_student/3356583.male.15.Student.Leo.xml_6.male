You know u whane like rolling stone. Cos the stone will find it's place. And when you hear the space. Just crawl and never run. And when your work is done. And then you see the sun. So sing what you want. I'm a man on a mission. No time to love. No time to be wasting. I want know if you feel the boredom. All the things you do that make you feel undone. Feel undone. Blues!  I heard you caught the blues. What was the sin? Have you got out of bed? Have you get out of there? You know a head space that you don't. And will you cannot and you don't. A fortune has been made. On all the illness they made. And then we've gotta pay. For the drugs to take it away. And then you're gonna find.  There's nothing with your mind. That you don't already know. That you ain't already seen.  Do you live in a dream? Save your song. Don't you cause trouble. Man on a mission.  Is a man in a bubble. Play your cards before your dice.  You'll get a piece of lemon.  And the piece of that vibe.  There's no time to be wasting.  By then... you'll wake up. And smile. Cos you know you're mine.
