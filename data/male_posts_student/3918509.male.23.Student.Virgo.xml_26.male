America is in a perilous situation. In the eyes of these Muslims we are the enemy because we are Christian, but in many areas of our culture, our conduct as a nation is anything but Christian. The Greek and Roman philosophers knew it; the Founders knew it; Reagan knew it; most of you know it:  America will be great as long as it is good.  Should America ever cease to be good, it will cease to be great.    That day, sadly, is upon us.  (Note: Though a version of the above statement is attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville, it is not actually found in  Democracy in America  and his authorship is suspect.  This does diminish the statement's truth.)
