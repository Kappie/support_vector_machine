For some reason I decided on westhills, perhaps because I knew how to get there.  So we hop on the c-train, then catch a bus up to the richmond area, where we enter a place that the bus does its turnaround, so we get off. Then the bus drives off to the theatre. It didn't turn around. OK, first minor setback. We had been wondering about what time it was, so we go up to a gas station to see if we can find out. It's closed. The closing time was 10. So we ran all the way to the theatre, only to have some guy tell us that it's 9:50. We had asthma attacks for nothing! We get up to the till, and overhear a patron talking with the clerk, and the clerk said that this would be the last nite the film would be shown in Calgary. Thank God we didn't miss it! He would've killed me where I stood! After some chitchat with some fellow fans (which happened to include the clerk) we went and did the deed. Yes, I mean the movie.  The documentary was good, and revealed a lot of things. St. Anger makes a lot more sense now. I don't want to say that it was just a bunch of crap they threw together while sitting there...But...Well, before St. Anger, what would happen was Lars and James would get together, write a bunch of songs, then show up and tell all the band members what to play. That didn't work, and caused a bunch of tumult within the band, so they decided on a more open approach, where all of the members input their thoughts. I liked it better the other way. Anyways, I got to see a different side of the band, which was good. I found out Jason Newstead is a prick anyways, and that they almost hired Twiggy Ramirez of Marilyn Manson to replace him. Thank God for Robert Truijilo. (I THINK I spelled that right, but try saying THAT name 10 times really fast!)  So the movie ends, and we look at the clock, and it's 12:30! The buses don't run anymore! Well, since I knew where we were and how to get where we were going (which was home) we started to walk, in the dark, at 11:30 to the other freaking end of the city. We stopped at Mac's for coffee, but both ended up getting sick off of it. Yay. After about an hour and a half of walking, we hadn't even made it downtown yet! We were down on 17th ave, and actually had been searching for a phone booth so we could call a cab, as it had been raining for the duration of our journey. All the phone booths we had found didn't have phone books in them, but we lucked out and this one did. So we called a cab, and after a few more minutes of waiting, finally hopped in a cab, and arrived home a little after 2 am. Oh well, mom, at least I showed up alive!  I think we experienced something that every teenager should go through at least once, and I kinda enjoyed it up until the part where it started raining. Oh well, I'm here now, and I don't have pneumonia, so I'm happy.
