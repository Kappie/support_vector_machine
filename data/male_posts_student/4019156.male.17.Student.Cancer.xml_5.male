(sorry, didnt mean to be too emo with that). so its like im just down right afriad. i dont want another repeat of what happened before. my mind always wonders into the worst case scenerio. so i always end up thinking like this nowadays. i guess all i can do is sit there n wait for the right time, or the right event, or that kinda thing. i dont no, id sure like some ideas on what i should do. that would be great.
