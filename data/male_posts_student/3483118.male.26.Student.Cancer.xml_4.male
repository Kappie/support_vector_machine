Since my first post I've been on the road with limited computer access for what adds up to 18 days.  But now, finally, I'm home for a stretch of several weeks.  My most recent destination was Cincinnati, which came off as an unlovable place to me for several reasons.  For one, I hate chili.  Also, I need a subway or a trolley or something.  Horse-drawn buggies and buses alone ain't cuttin it.  Third, and I know I'll sound like a grumpy old man when I say this, there were kids acting a fool all over the place.  Seriously, the entire downtown was like the movie theater at Union station (DC reference there, for all of my readers from elsewhere on the globe).  Fourth, and worst, Cincinnati fell into the dubiously distinguished league of places I've been to where people will say off-the-wall racist things to you so nonchalantly that it almost sounds like they're talking about the weather or the local ball team.  Yuck.   For sake of fairness, I should note that most of the people I met and worked with were cool, non chili-eating, unbigoted folks, and there was lots to do in the downtown area.  Also, it has a pleasant climate and an authentic atmosphere that comes only with age and lots of brick buildings -- Reston, Virginia it ain't.    Still, though, it doesn't make the list of cities I have to see again.
