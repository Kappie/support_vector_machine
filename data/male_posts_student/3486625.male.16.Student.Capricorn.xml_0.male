Look at the bigger picture. A few days of self-content vs. a lifetime of wasting your effort on someone thats not even worth it. Don't feel pissed off, feel sorry. Feel sorry that they have to live not knowing that a dozen people are right up their throats.  And if you aren't a person who wants someone to pay and your friend is, then just laugh off at the ppl plotting against each other while you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the show, whatever the outcome is. Am I right or am I right?
