The ones where when he was trying to hook up the scanner and couldn't find the right plug-in, so he made his own. I loved those jokes. Now, we have moved on to Matt and HALO jokes. Personally, I love Pokemon. Even though Pokemon sucks, I still love it. That is why I have the Pokemon Movie CD. I'm to lazy to say anything else.
