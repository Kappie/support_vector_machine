       
      Really, tomorrow is my only hard day of exams. Here's our school's schedule:   Tuesday:  1st Period Exam - U.S. History Periods 3-6 2nd Period Exam - PreCal PAP TAG   Wednesday:  7th Period Exam - English AP (no exam in any AP class, but we still have to show up) Periods 3-6 3rd Period Exam - Physics AP (except I have to do Computer Science AP late testing at this time)   Thursday:  5th Period Exam - Spanish AP 6th Period Exam - Computer Science AP   Friday:  4th Period Exam - Theater Arts (long term project turned in today) 8th Period Exam - Lunch   Varsity Baseball plays this week on Thursday @ 7:30 and Saturday @ 4:00. I'll be working both those games (and the third, if necessary). Apparently no one thinks I'm going to be a trainer for Varsity Football next year (which I  am ), so a bunch of people got happy about that when I told them. We also have a picture for that during the 8th Period Exam on Friday -- good thing I rearranged my schedule to have lunch then.
