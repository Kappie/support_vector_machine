So today, i was sitting there, doing nothing, so i went into the jacuzzi at like 8'oclock. I love going in the Spa in hte morning... The sun is rising and the sky is clear but cloudy... its just very relaxing.  Then i got out and my mom came home... and she suggested to go do something with Katie. so i called her and asked her to go see Spiderman 2 with me, and she said yea, and i was excited, and then like usual, an exciting event was again cancelled... i dont know exactly why... something to do with our car getting fixed... i dont know...  At around four, I got Proactiv in the mail... It's a line of acne products that i bought... its really good... go check it out for yourself, i dont need to explain... www.proactiv.com  Then the MLB Home Run Derby... yeah... Then  I love the ninties was on, which was good but i put too much expectation in it, it kind of let me down.   Yeah, im tired, so im gonna log off.. cya   Switchfoot More Than Fine lyrics   When I wake in the morning I want to blow into pieces. I want more than just okay, more than just okay.  When I'm up with the sunshine I want more than just a good time I want more than just okay, more than just okay.  I'm not givin' up, givin' up now. I'm not givin' up, not backing down.  More than fine, more than bent on getting by. More than fine, more than just okay.  When I'm lit with the sunrise, I want more than just the blue skies I want more than just okay, more than just okay.  More than oceans away from the dawn More than oceans away from who we are. More than oceans, more than oceans More than fine.    This is how i feel a lot of the times... i want more than i have... but not just materialistic... like, mentally... I want to achieve all these goals i have for myself in a short amount of time... but i have my whole life. This is a very cocky song... kind of like me... i kind of feel that im better than everyone sometimes, and i desere more... and i think thats what Switchfoots trying to say about themselves and their fans...
