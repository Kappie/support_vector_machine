Had an excellent night tonight. I even missed curfew just because i was having such a good time. Cara and I have decided that going out and meeting new people would be sweet. Great place to do this? COPPER ROCK! Its great. I also love the music scene, i'm convinced one way to a person's heart is through music. the music that lives in them. and everyone.  ~benjamin.
