Seriously is there anything remotely redeaming about it?  Its just beats, over and over and over.  And when you hear silence, you hope that it has finished. But its just a tease, cause those fat beats start to drop again.  Why am I ranting about this you ask?  Cause the people below me LOVE it, and feel the need to share it with everyone.  Especially at 2 or 3 in the morning, the most convienent time for everyone else.  So considerate.  After finally falling asleep I was again awoken to the sounds of the house next door being demoed.  Originally, I thought this would be really cool and only take a few days to do, but they've been working (or not working as it were) since the third week of August!  The work ethic in the South is just about as good as there tollerence for minorities.  I'm so tired.  I want restfull sleep.  And someone just came and knocked on my door telling me they're having a party tonight...No rest for the weary
