I've been listening to the album I mentioned yesterday pretty much constantly. When I get an album, I tend to listen to one song or two, and then when I hear the other songs they tend to reveal their complexity and goodness slowly, untill I love the entire album. It's the same here.  2. ...food?  I'd have to say McDonald's french fries. But they have to be fresh and hot, of course.  3. ...tv show?  The West Wing. This season is  okay , but the first four seasons are great. Absolutely brilliant stuff.  4. ...scent?  Cold Night Winter Air. I love to go outside and take a deep breath.   5. ...quote?   "My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind." -Albert Einstein. This is my belief system in a nutshell, Einstein sums it up wonderfully. I have it on my wall.
