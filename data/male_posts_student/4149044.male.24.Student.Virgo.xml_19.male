Thinking about dragging my ass to the gym though.      Grace and I have been planning our trip next weekend (still waiting on that damn confirmation), and holy shit it's looking pretty expensive so far. Spago's or Nobu. Studio 54 or Rain. Voodoo Lounge or Ghost Bar. No matter what we choose or where we go, everything is going to be so fucking expensive. What happened to the days of the $5 all-you-can-eat steak dinners my dad keeps talking about? Fuckin' A. Not sure I want to spend $200 to see Lance Burton make shit disappear, or pay $25 to ride a two-minute roller coaster at New York, New York. I definitely want to see Zumanity though, and I guess I can deal with just going to either Rain or Studio 54. We'll probably end up spending a lot of time just walking around, checking out all the new hotels and shops. The rest of the time we'll be eating. There are so many nice-ass restaurants in Vegas there's just no way I'm going to settle for generic shit. I would much rather blow $80 at a nice restaraunt - like one of Wolfgang Puck's or one of Emeril's - than spend it at some magic show. I'm all about eating. So far I think we've decided on Spago's, Postrio, and the Eiffel Tower Restaurant. And of course a champagne brunch at the Bellagio or MGM. That's probably around $300 right there, but at least we'll have a ton of fun getting our money's worth heheh. Crap I just found out the Aladdin is completely booked for this weekend. Damn. Time to call up the Monte Carlo or MGM or whatever else is available.
