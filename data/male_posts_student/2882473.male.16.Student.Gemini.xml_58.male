Funnily enough, I woke up at just gone five in the morning, and as I couldn't get back to sleep, read a couple of chapters of Harry Potter, before getting up at 0630. I met Steve at me local station and got a tram to East Croydon, where I met the others. And then to Staines, for a fun and thrilling day. (Notice the alliteration there). Samurai was proably the best ride, which we went on about 5 times. And not only is it a greta ride, but they play the Burly Brawl music in the background too. Sooooo cool. Anyway, Collosus was also good, as was Vortex, Nemesis, Detonator and Tidle Wave, which we got soaked on. And I stayed wet for most of the day, after standing in the big wave at the end several times. Had Burger King For Lunch, which was nice.  Oh, and for some reason I got REALLY sunburnt. I mean REALLY sunburnt. My face is pink and the back of my neck is damn painful. There is a very distinct line where my shirt collar started. :) It will be painful tomorrow... :( It wasn't even that hot and sunny. It was cloudy for some of the day. Damn skin type 1...  Also, after listening to the Burly Brawl music 5 times, we had decided (me,  urlLink nonnesuch , rob and  urlLink megatrobe ) that we may attempt to learn some of it, just as it would look so cool. Or not. But it would be fun, and that's what counts. :) We obviously can't do the high kicks, or the trows, but we could put other stuff in. It truly is an excellent fight scene. One of the best I've seen in fact.   urlLink Dickybod  is now reading the Harry Potter series, in an attempt to beat me to the end, even with me nearly having a 4 book head start. He finised the first 2 today. I'm buggered. How embaressing...  And yes, I am very much enjoying my summer. I expect great times ahead.   Ta ta for now   Weather:  Sunny, though I thought it was cloudy :(  Reading:  Harry Potter 4  Listening to:  Burly Brawl Music  Watching:  Burly Brawl in background  Confused about:  sunburn  Annoyed with:  sunburn  Mood:   In a bit o' pain
