NO  Conservatory ( which means i dont have to get up at some stupid hour (usually 6:30) and then get to the place by 8 ),  NO  YO rehearsal ( that means no going to Davies at 1 and practicing till 5 ), and ofcourse i have NO school on Monday....which makes this weekend the best ever. And My granparents are coming next friday so i'm very pleased.
 
thing im not looking forward too=studying my butt off for the history and latin I exam coming up this teusday , but it wont be that bad
