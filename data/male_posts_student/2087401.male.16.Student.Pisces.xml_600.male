It wasn't even funny, it was just pitiful. I gave them half a pool cue to smite the paper mache pig.  Later on, I played cards with the last of the guests, people I actually knew from middleschool.  One of them turned out to be obscurely related to us. We've got another half cousin now.   It's Garage Sale Day! I've been looking for a TV, but everything is either too small, or doesn't have the right connection thingies for my ps2.  And the cost of some, geez. Some people don't understand the purpose of a garage sale. The point is to get rid of stuff, not to make a whole lot of money. It's pocket change, most likely going to be spent on the equally cheap merchandise of others. Some people got the idea, though, like the person from whom I bought a sega genesis. one dollar. It was fate. There was the machine, and there was a dollar in my pocket. Now I just have to find some games, another controller, and the wires I need to plug it in.  I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!
