Just thought I'd let you know. =)   Oh yeah, and one more thing... remember wayyyyyyy back in June I was talking about those AOL CL Classes? Well, yesterday, I finally finished them and I have the "Congratulations" letter to prove it! [Some parts of the letter have been removed for confidential reasons]   "I hope that your training and guidance under my instructing and coaching, was a satisfying, enjoyable and a pleasant experience. In instructing and coaching you, my object is to provide you with a thorough training in a friendly, relaxed and helpful manner and to help you be the best message board host you can be. If I accomplished this then I'm greatly satisfied and know that you are ready for your Community.   From my years of experience, I have learned that after leaving classes and training, hosts often have questions or concerns which they would like to discuss with me on a private level. If you are unclear about any aspect of your role as a volunteer message board host, please e-mail me and I will be more than happy to answer any questions that you may have.   YOU make the difference in your training here at Community Leader Education, to America Online, your volunteerism to your community and to the members of your community.   I am here to help you throughout your involvement with AOL, as a friend and someone you can trust and rely on and can help you with any obstacles that may come your way. So if you had a great shift or need a problem resolved, I am always here to lend a hoof and help you out, in any way that I can.   Thank you again for being a student of mine and I consider myself fortunate to be able to help you through your training."
