Tuesday really hits hard when you think to yourself that you have 3 more days not including today. Plus I have a double Chemistry period which should be considered capital punishment. I found something somewhat ammusing thought today. At last period, a certain kid who sits behind me (I won't mention names Dave) decided to pretend to write stuff on my back. Funny funny. Well turns out our teacher saw him and apparently didn't see the pen in his hand. This lead her to believe that he was just touching my back. He was told "just move away if you feel like touching him(me)  again." Interpret this story as you like.
