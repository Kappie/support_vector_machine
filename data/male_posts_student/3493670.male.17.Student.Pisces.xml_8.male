And its awfulness was intensified exponentially due to overplaying. And creative DJ's actually made remixes and added excerpts from the movie itself (Jaaaaccckkk! Rooooossssssee!).This song is actually the equivalent of 2 caesarians and a lobotomy.   2.) Horny. Circa 1999.   Sex in music is definitely overrated. There is such a thing as erotic music that actually stimulates lust and is perfect for making out. But this song actually makes my libido shrivel up and die. I mean the song goes like  I'm horny! Horny Horny Horny! ( repeat 2000 times). I gotta hand it to her. She's actually got a tiny vocabulary and to make matters worse, I would hear kids particularly in elementary singing the song. The closet moralist in me is actually cringing at the memory of kids singing it.   3.) Hot In Herre by Nelly. Circa 2002.   Back to the subject of sex in music. This is actually one of the songs that made me shake my head in total disgust. Don't get me wrong, I'm not totally a closet moralist. The song is crass and it has no taste. It goes like  its getting hot in herre so take off your clothes.  And a line that has something to do with a pole in the basement. I'm shaking my head in complete and utter disgust because Nelly is butt ugly. Damn I would look a thousand times better even after a bar brawl and a lobotomy.   4.) My Way by Frank Sinatra. Circa God knows when.   This song has actually killed people. Armed drunken fucks have been shooting people who's been singing the song. It turns drunkards homicidal and turnspets like dogs intomeankilling machines!might I add this teeny tiny info. When I was younger, I could remember my Uncle Delfin singing My Way and actually heard dogs barking while he was singing. It got me thinking, were the dogs hungry or were they just simply going homicidal? Maybe its animal cruelty.   Since I'm pretty drained and tired, I'm gonna make this a two parter. Hehehe! This is me trying to humor myself after a painful introspection.
