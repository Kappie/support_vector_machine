I forgot about my protractor and my CD-R, so had to spend money at the bookshop. After that, we, the very nervous bunch, went down to assembly. Oh my!! After assembly, Mrs Chua segregated us off to our respective labs (Bio Lab 2 for me!). The invigilator is Mrs Ong Lay Hoon for me.   Oh my! I dare say, the practical is quite easy. Easier than expected! The Chem one only test for gases (which I was wrong for M2 because I can't test the presence of ammonia. Darn!!). For Physics, the circuit (yes, electricity) has been set up for us, and we are supposed to find voltage and current of the lamp then plot graph. And I drew a best straight line, which turned out to be wrong! Hey! I can't even plot a curve with the points I have! Anyway, I expected much worse. Chem can be accounted for, because Rekha (oh oh! she keep looking at me you know. Why ar? HeHe! Because I was looking around ma. Finished both experiments liao, so bored.) is very protective of her Sec 5s. I expected something like the exercises in the Chem Prac workbook. For Physics, dunnoe why so easy leh. Miss Tan even said that most of the time we have to set up circuit ourselves! Or the exam is not set by Miss Tan! Hmmm! Very strange!   Okay, after the test, we went up to class and be quarantined. Oh meow! We have like 3 hours to spend there. Teachers keep coming in to invigilate us. I didn't study bio that much. Maybe study during dinner or something. I chatted with CQ and YH. YH drew blue eyeshadow on my eyelids. Oh my!! Then, all of them contributed to drawing me. The face, drawn by Ah Ji, not bad la! But hor!! WQ draw a very fat body and labelled it as "KY 10 years later". I think that was really uncalled for. And moreever, he put on the t-shirt "I Love Miss W" (I said in annoyance, "Might as well put XC there". Now they are convinced that I like XC. HaHa!). At first, I really wanted to tear up the drawing. But I thought: If I did that, then I would be "entertaining" them (maybe 'them' is bit too harsh. 'Him', more likely) by breaking down in anger (I learnt it from harry Potter! Such an educational book). And I certainly don't want to be doing that. So, I controlled myself and just raised an eyebrow at everything. I am so darn proud of myself now! Wendy said that I finally managed to control my anger. YaY!!   After that, we stayed back to eat. Hmmm.....the people today were talking about how wrong it is to take food from people's plate, even if the owner have given you permission and don't mind. Frnakly speaking, I think it's crap. Come on lor. People gave you permission le. Sometimes, they don't even want to eat. Instead of wasting, might as well give me and let it serve its purpose by being eaten. When people give you permission, I don't think it's rude lor. I know Hann and Manda don't mind all these one. They just take food directly. I can understand ma. I grew up doing that! HaHa!! Meow! Even taking other's food is fun!  Okay. I brought my prezzie for my mortal cat today. Wendy and I was supposed to buy ours today. She didn't, because of various undisclosed reasons. I am gonna doll my prezzie up nicely and give it to my mortal. When? Not telling. :P You know, SL told Wendy that thjis game is kinda pointless. Because it's mainly concentrates on giving presents, but not motivating them. Hmm. I don't know lor. Wendy hopes her presents are motivating, and I hope mine are too. I did make the effort to motivate my mortal cat. I hope the cat is motivated!! Espeically during this time of the year! I am not motivated. Why? My angel didn't give me anything and neither did Clar's, Ping's and XiaoXi's. Well, I think they are too busy, or don't know us well enough to give what we like. But at least something in the fourth week is good enough liao la. Even a note suffices. And I got this stinking feeling who my Angel is. Let's see if my feelings are right in the end of this round.  Alright! I shall be ending about now. Dad's gonna holler any moment to tell us to come eat dinner. See ya tomorrow blog! Best of luck to me in my Bio Prac. See ya!
