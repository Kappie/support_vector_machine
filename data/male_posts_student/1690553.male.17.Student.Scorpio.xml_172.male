The first blog is  urlLink FKM 1113 , dedicated to share notes from the Fundamental Knowledge for Muslims: Introduction to Islam course I'm taking this semester. Although just in form of short notes, I hope many would be able to benefit from it.  Second blog is  urlLink Tinta Ibnu Ariff , created solely to practice my native language in writing. Now I realize that it is my Malay Language which is getting rustier because the use of dialects and slangs. Not to mention of my own preference to communicate in English at times and the use of English as first language here in MCIIUM to top it of. Insya-Allah, this would be a good 'Anti-Rust' treatment and hopefully would maintain my edge in Bahasa Melayu.  Surf these two new blogs at:   urlLink http://www.ibnuariff.com/fkm    urlLink http://www.ibnuariff.com/tinta
