Like, destiny and shit.  It's so wierd how your entire life can be chnged by one single event....like, let's say i didn;t do this, or never did that....ya know? it;s crazy shit, but when you think like that, your more aware of yout decisions and you become a better person.  Well, ya, thats about...the title, if you haven;t already figured out, is a pick-up line, and no, i'd prolly never use it....well, maybe, but only to make someone laugh.  This brings me to a little saying that i can't stop telling people....it's soo true too...what is it u ask? "Men  always  want what they can't have..." i now in a sense live by this quote....it kinda calms me down when i'm pissed that i don't have a girl. (if you dun wanna read me bitching about  my lady issues, than u can stop here i guess)  It's like, shit.....i juss read jones' blog, and felt sorry for him.  I know he loves her, and to go through that kinda shit really sucks.  Meanwhile, other dilemas occur.  One freind, from what i here, is either already going out with, or is close to going out with this girl he's wanted to for a long time.  Thats great, and i couldn't be happier for him....but everytime i think about it, it makes me get the ol' goosebumps....why can he get a great girl, and me have nothing but my guitar, and my right hand? (sorry, trying to ligten up the mood) so i sit....listen to loves songs i would love to deticate to someone, juss doing nothing but bitch into this thing.  Like i stated in earlier entires, i think my "standards" are too high...  Which brings me to my next thought.....antioch.  See, since the first day, i've asked about the girls there....and now that i know them, i dun do anything....it's not cause i dun want to, it's juss that..well, i dun want to! it's sooo wierd.....like, generally, i would try to do what kornhouser did all weekend....flirt with as many people as posible...but no, nothing.  Maybe time will tell, but for now, i dun know.  wow...that shit was really random. but anyway, ya. i think everyone there is looking for someone, juss hasn;t found em', and when they do go out with each other, it can sometimes lead to hurt, like one freinds went through, which really sucks.  Well, because i have nothing better to do 9i have tons of HW, but i'll do that tomarrow) i juss i'll juss state my opinions of the girls at antioch...not like "o i hate this and that" but like, how i feel about them if i were to be in a relationship with them...if your reading this, and your from antioch, go and tell everyone if you want, i really dun care, this is  my  blog ya now.....well, i guess i'll start off with sara, or however u spell it.....super fun chick, great fun with her, definitly can;t see myself with her...i dunno, maybe it's the whole rock thing, i have no idea....michelle is her equal/better half that is definitly a blast to hang out with...she has a super long tounge, and is always sitting in soe kind of yoga position...can never see myself with her....maybe cause she so old or something, i dunno.....judith is cute, but she might already be going out with a freind, or about to, and i prolly don;t know her enough to really try anything even if i want to, cause i know i don't.  um...shit, fucks this thing, it's taken to long....in a nutshell, i really can't see myself with anyone at antioch....YET...i gues i have to know them better.  Why did i juss type this? to show the world that once again, my chick chances are narrowed down to about nothing.  I would aks some freinds to hook me up with someone or something, but then i dun wanna go on a date where "our mommies' drop us off...i guess maybe thats why i wanna older chick...who knows.    adaskaskdkldhaskddklH!! sorry, i dun know what to do. I kinda got a headache...and i'm alittle down...but what ever.  Time to swtich the subject now....hmmmmmmmmmmm.  i have nothing to say.  I've been playing alot of guitar lately, and proud to say haven;t gone to olda now for about 3 months....helps my ear training. O, i got the info on the Music college of berklee ting or whatever, it;s aHUGE book on everything to do...i'm serioudly considering music tharapy...but thats another story.  what else happen.....did i mention i read jones' blog? i really didn't know he thought of it like that....and i guess i kinda feel the same way he does.  I hope he knows he's still are very best freind, and that the krew ain't going no where. dammit, nothing to say....i guess if anyone reading this (all 4 f you now i think) now someone to hook me upwith i'm all ears....i need a girl dammit.  maybe at antioch i'll start hitting on some chicks....but they all live soooooooooooooo far away.  i think this chick nicole lives in ossining, and thats about it....everyone is mostly in croton which isn;t that bad, and the better ones are father away.  ya.  guess i gotta wait till sunday then.  go to the  urlLink Love Calculator,  it's pretty cool...it may not be 4real, but it's fun.....i typed in alot of chicks names, and lets juss say i didnt fail any of them.....well, wathever, i'm tired....till da next one...
