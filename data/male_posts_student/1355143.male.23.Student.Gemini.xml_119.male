Another reason has been that not much has been happening in my life for the last few weeks but last weekend something finally something happened.... (written later, I haven't got time for a spell check.)  First on Thursday I went to buy a bed which costs over 1,000 dollars (200*135cm). I had spoken to my friend about helping me out giving me the do-es and don't-s of that business coz he used to work in the store I wanted to buy in. Well I had sent him an e-mail but he want able to talk to me until almost six, so at five when I was walking into the store I rang him to give me the short version but hey he had just moved in with his girlfriend and had a year old bed, same size which he was willing to give me for little over a third of the price. I was so glad for the next few days.  Earlier that I ha gotten an email from the head of the asset management department that due to great results this quarter, when we became the biggest fund in Iceland, we were all gonna meet at the bar and get some drinks... free. I got there late coz I had the bed thing and was wearing the Mickey shirt that gave everyone quite a laugh, the first thing my boss said "have what you want in the bar" I replied with "I wished you'd say that more often to me" she said we should go out more often!!!  I came home at twelve after watching a depressing match where Greece made it to the final... Why god, why?!?!?!?! Not entirely sober  The day after me and my cousin moved the bed from my friends house to mine while moving  a shelf a statue fell from it and to my cousins back ... It needed stitches.  We went to the emergency room where my cousin knew everybody coz he used to work there so we got it for free, gained some 40 euros there.  Few hours later there was a welcome party at that same cousins house for him coz he´s a med student in... Hungary and just came home last Sunday. I got very drunk (has that ever happened) and in the end I think I did hit on an friends girlfriend who has been with this guy for years and years.... not good.  On the Saturday I woke up late and went to the grocery store bought some stuff and the ríkið (Icelandic for government) which is the governments alcohol store. Then I picked up another cousin of mine and his friend and we all went to my grandmothers summer house (the worst one ever, no electricity, no running water no nothing... but nice).   All of a sudden there came this song on the radio which is called I whish I had an Evil twin pretty funny.  There we BAR-b-q-ed, I got drunk and then we went to my schools camping. When I came the first thing I saw was my friend walking towards me and this girl who always "the drunk one"(that means that Im not always that person). The girl was walking little behind him and walked into a little mud fell like Chaplin it was hilarious!!! Then later that evening was two person getting it on in a car few moments later the drunk girl came and I said "knock on the door" well she did and then opened it. The couple wasn't too happy with that and when she had opened the door 5 times they locked it, so she opened the next.... classic.  I then started talking to a very, very hot girl :D who had a boyfriend in the camp :( But she was giving me gave me a lot of tips on hitting on girls:D. Then just before O left I went peeing and so did she, I just walked to the next tree (not Tim style) but the girl went further into the Forrest. Ok so when I'm pulling up the pants, an idiot that had wanted to kick my ass once before for not supporting his team comes. In the same moment the girl comes back pulling up her second pants (the ones who hold water). Ok the guy figures we were doing it, I was so pissed. Also because this girls boyfriend is a nice guy and I don't think she would leave him for me (no offence.. to me). He threatened to tell the guy and I just said go a head... He didnt.  Ok to more things there are some hot 40 year old moms here .... just for you Tim ;)  And launch is genius.  Úlli  p.s. This has become over a page on word so nouff said
