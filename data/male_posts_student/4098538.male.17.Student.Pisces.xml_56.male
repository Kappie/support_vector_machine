Mwuahahahahaaaa... anyway. Mandy got in my college! She's doing a 2 year course in jewellery and I'm doing a 2 year course in graphics. The thought of spending 2 years at the same college is amazing! Last few days have been nice. It feels like a completely new relationship because we both really are stopping the stupid arguing as it's overly childish and now it's great! We went bike-riding on Saturday on some hills 'n stuff near Mandy's house and I went and popped her mums boyfriends tire! Ah well. We've spent so much time together lately too. Every possible minute. Today it is May Day so I didn't have to go to college. We went to Styal and carved stuff into a stone wall. The nice weather is great too. If it carries on we're gonna have a BBQ on Friday! I got a new stereo yesterday, FINALLY. I have had my old one for about 4 years and the CD player on it doesn't work so I have had to use my DVD player! It sounds so good! I have 4 speakers on it too which adds to the sound quality. I put up all my old posters too on an angle and it makes my room really trippy! Anyway, it's 11pm, meaning Mandy is out of work now, meaning I am gonna go call her.
