(phobia of stepping on shit that overflowed). then ytd nite it was raining damn heavily. the rain was blowing into our room and was irritating me like siao. so..i covered my blanket over me. ok..for a while it worked..until i realised icldnt sleep with the noise. so i snuggled closer the the wall whichwas away from the window. it worked for a while too..but..well..the rain still splattered in..so..i snuggled closer to the wall..haha now it worked. then..horse got up and was cursing smth like.."u all are asswipes lar.." then he closedhis window and stepped on my bed..closed my window and gave me that u-asswipe-never-close-ur-window look. *oopz* i really like how my mind works when im sleeping..my mind concentrates on getting back to sleep rather than make my sleep even more comfortable.    o yar..jenhan..u asswipe! y u only board 3 weeks? gonna be..sooooooooooo borring. dotx.
