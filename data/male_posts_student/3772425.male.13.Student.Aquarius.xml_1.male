Nur Ainun. then, we jus walk around jaya jusco, maluri and drank something new in starbuck's *a coffee that really taste nice* with my senior. man...so exhausted after the event. tomorrow i had to catch up with homework and studies..i really miss out a lot and im getting worried...and my plan to watch spiderman 2, in leisure mall, cheras was not that good nor bad. a few have pull back all the sudden, like desmond, yi wei and samantha *yeah sam, your name's on it. the only ones confirmed to go is jus me and teo...
