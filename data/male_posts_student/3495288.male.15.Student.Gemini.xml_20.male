While i was zipping up my pants, my instructor called me. He ordered me to do DRILL!, YAY! at lasT! got DRILL! i love Drills!. Well once he put down the phone i got ready everything and RAN OFF to school. I noticed that the music room was still locked and that the band members were behind the library for falling in and all. I shouted to Shazwanie, the main Drum Mistress.. i am her Assistant, that Drill for 20mins. Well i too fall-in into the file, once she gave the announcements and commanded the members to seperate them self into 4 groups, one major per group. Once that was done, as usual i am incharged of group TWO, i did the usual Drill routines. "Kebelakang Pusing! Ke Kiri Pusing! Ke Kanan Pusing! Dari Kiri cepat jalan!...etc" well once that was done i gave them a short break and talked to them. My instructor came just in time to teach them how to do "Ke belakang Pusing while Marching and Ke Kiri Belok". Once thought i practiced commanding those drills. Than we had a small competition to see which group was better, group one combined with two (mine and Shaz's) and three and four, well it turns out that one and two won! hahah thanks to US! hahah. Well than the whole day we practiced on dynamics, scales, tuning, Awakening Hills (our SYF choice piece) and 2nd Suite in F Major 1st(Marching), 3rd(Never ending love)and 4th(Fantasia in the 'Degarson'). After that hard day i decided to bring home my tuba. After that i recieved a call from my friend that there is Dance Rehersals at the HALL. Well ran with my tuba, in the casing of course, to the HALL (not the school hall lah its a void deck) when i reached the place there was no one. Tired i went home. Did not rest i straight away took a shower and got ready for the concert that i attended, Sembawang Wind Orchestra: Konzert 11. Well i went to the concert with Ash and Roy. I had to pay the tickets first cause my instrutor has already booked the tickets for us. I met them at P.S. (plaza Singapura). Once i met them, i hugged Ash infront of the large crowd. He wore something different and i wore something different. Its like i and him had a fashion exchange, he wore baggy clothes (which i love to wear) and i wore tight and gayish clothes (which i am getting the hang of it hahaha). We walked in and out searching for a place to eat. Instead we went to Long John Silvers and ate there, Wah its about time i ate something... my first meal of the day. After 'dinner'we went straight to Victoria Concert Hall. It was packed with idiots from Dunmand High (donno if correct spelling ahaha!). Ok lets skip this part where i get the tickets. I was amazed by the TUBA! only two! one is a C Tuba the other is a MIRAPHONE! i love MIRAPHONES! it is so nice! The first song has a C tuba playing as a solo. LIKE WOW! i play a C tuba! haha now i can learn some stuffs from this fat guy. hahaha. It was superb! seeing that guy play! its like the other version of VINCENT, my senior who is a very good tuba player... he thought me properly how to play the TUBA. Well the other song with this tubist is TUBA CONCERTO! wow! tuba too has a CONCERTO! hahaha so good! Man! i love this guy's playing of the Miraphone man! he plays like me hahaha really but i need more practice in my fast fingering and etc lor.Some more i don't know the fingerings to a Miraphone.. its a little different than a C tuba cause Miraphones have four valves and C tubas have just three. I was amazed by this two guys. Oh yeah during the first half of the concert i sat in the middle while Ash and Roy sat at the corner. I noticed this guy who plays a flute was looking at me, i went like "Is it me or is he staring at those ugly girls behind me?"... he has been staring at me since i entered the concert hall. From my first seat at the corner with Ash and Roy till i was in the middle. Than everytime he would like peak at me over his stand... Ah! i must be imagining things lah... hahaha. Well after the concert... all those from Dunman High went WE WANT MORE! WE WANT MORE!... the concert has already ended and the players have already started leaving... so i shouted.. GO HOME! IF YOU WANT MORE! GO HOME! IF YOU WANT MORE! hahahah... and they stared at me and i giggled ahaha. Once we left that over crowded full of idiots, we all went walking around. Than Roy say he wanted to eat... than we started to walk around to fine nice places... i lead them lor... showed them some neat places to eat.. but i too wanted to eat lah but never mind, you will soon find out. Well when we at City Link near HMV roy went like talking to Ash in private lor ... i decided to like not notice lor. Than like i see Roy's face as if he is not happy with me lor.When we went to Suntec City, Ash asked me if they could go to Marche. I excused them lor... I lost my appetite cause like i too wanted to eat lor but never mind. I feel like i am a obstruction, i am a muslim and they are an another religion. They can eat what ever they want but i can't.. when we reached Marche... i got worried cause i dono what is Halal and what is not so i decided not to eat anything, or even drink. Ash bought Potato Wedges and Roy had Milk Shake. I got into a world of imagination not knowing what is going on but i came back to reality when Roy asked me if i want to eat instant noodles. -.- ... like instant noodles? i have not had a PROPER MEAL for a week and asking me to eat instant noodles. Well when we stopped by at 7-eleven.. i bought Ice Coffee and Apple and Green Tea drink. Tats all nothing else. When we reached the MRT station... i like try not to look at them lor cause i got quiet sad. The final words was Good bye and a hand shake from Ash. Than i walked off. In the train i felt like crying because i had not have a proper meal ( i am VERY VERY VERY hungry!) and i might not see him soon and feeling like an obstruction. Once reached home i cooked a proper meal for my self... and ate... and now i am here typing this blog. Well till next time... take care all... bye.
