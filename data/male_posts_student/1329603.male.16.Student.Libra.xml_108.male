I don't know, she has cool eyes, is swoonable, and is generally cool.  I also realised that I can never let Sally see my sites, because she will get to my blog, where I've spent most of my time talking about her... whoops!  Oh, and Libby, if you're reading... hi! Heh, my blog has a fan. She was probably being sarcastic, but at least it gets read. She quoted it at me in an attack so she must read it.  Anyway, yes... slightly too knackered to say a lot more, I'll repost tomorrow after I get back from Scott's. Promise!  Lots of love, Jon Roskilly
