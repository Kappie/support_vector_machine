I'm not feeling too hot right now because of a certain something called "giving the machine that I've been using that isn't really mine, but rather my dad's work's machine, which is much nicer than the machine i'll be going back to soon" syndrome. It's a real bummer for a number of reasons. One is the performance. I'll actually have to wait a whole few seconds for Safari to open a new window... It'll take longer than 10 seconds for Fireworks to come up... Mail will take a bit longer to check... Ya know, things like that. Then there's the part about HD space. I've gotten so used to 160GB. I'll have to go back to a lame old 135GB. I know, I know, it's not much to complain about, but when you think about how 115 of it's taken by default by other people's backed up data, it is a major hit. Thirdly, screen real estate. I also got used to 15 inches of places to put stuff. It'll be hard to go back to 1024 x 768 :-(. A lot of it's also sentimental. I have a tendency to get really attached to my machines. I still have my old Tangerine iBook, Tangerine iMac, 600Mhz iBook (that's the one I'll be going back to, if not the iMac), and first rev (5GB) iPod. I can never bring myself to sell my old technology. I'd be like selling a piece of myself, but not THAT much of myself. Probably just like ripping my index fingernail off (that's actually happened to me once) and selling it. That's how much it would hurt, but it would last like 8 months.  Anyway, this could be one of the last postings from ol' ME 262 as I like to call him. Farewell, old friend, farewell!         -- Feanor
