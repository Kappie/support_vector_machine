Next time anyone sees that wonderful little wizard, give him a hug and a kiss for being so damn tight.  Slow week in news, but I went and saw Day After Tomorrow and got thinking about global warming.  The danger is very real- studies have shown that seasonal allergy symptoms get worse every year thanks to global warming.  Steps have been taken to reduce its escalation (at least industrially), most notably through the Kyoto plan or protocol or whatever it's called.  Unfortunately for human kind, many countries that donate significant portion of greenhouse industrial excrement can't afford to change their industrial standards to reduce the CFC's and such that fill the atmosphere.  (Watch me spin this politically) I commend George Dubya for  expelling a hideous dictator out of the goodness of his heart despite the sacrifices of many Americans for purely humanitarian reasons without any nice byproducts that the American economy is STILL waiting for the benefits of... but I regret that the U.S. in all its glory can't aid an ally like, say, Russia modernize its industry which would not only benefit said nation, but the whole world.  Everyone elses thoughts on saving the environment and therefore the world?  Love Rob
