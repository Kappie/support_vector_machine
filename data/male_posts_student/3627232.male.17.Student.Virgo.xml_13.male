    
       
      On this night I look upon the moon And I see its light bursting through the clouds Reaching my eyes and burning through my mind Nights such as these are rare indeed I feel as though I should stop and stare But I move on, for I've places to be now And yet it calls me with its captivating light And then I wish that I were a creature of the night.
