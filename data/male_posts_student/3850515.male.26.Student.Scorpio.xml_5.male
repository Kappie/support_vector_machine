However, patient safety programs largely address provider-interests, and many times overlook patient preferences and needs. Active engagement of the patient in all aspects of the patient safety agenda is necessary for its success. Patient safety, then, requires: a comprehensive agenda informed by patient preferences and experiences; an informed and motivated populace; mechanisms integrate safe practices and patient preferences, and investment in safety-enhancing devices and care strategies.      Improving patient safety through informatics tools for shared decision making and risk communication   Pages 551-557  Cornelia M. Ruland   This paper describes how informatics tools can support shared decision making and risk communication and thereby play an important role in enhancing patient safety. Using preference elicitation techniques and knowledge on risk communication, such tools can help patients understand their treatment options and associated short- and long-term benefits and risks, assist in the elicitation of patient preferences, and help patients and clinicians in making treatment choices with the highest likelihood of achieving desired patient outcomes. Important features of such tools are proposed, including: (1) Interactive tutorials to improve risk comprehension and prepare patients and clinicians for the decision making task; (2) choices between different presentation modes to meet patients’ individual reading levels and presentation preferences; (3) risk calculations that account for individual risk profiles; (4) performance of necessary calculations to reach the actual decision; (5) automatic updates of evidence; and (6) the use of different preference-elicitation techniques.

Simpson   The Institute of Medicine’s landmark report asserted that medical error is seldom the fault of individuals, but the result of faulty healthcare policy/procedure systems. Numerous studies have shown that information technology (IT) can shore up weak systems. For nursing, IT plays a key role in eliminating nursing mistakes. However, managing IT is a function of managing the people who use it. For nursing administrators, successful IT implementations depend on adroit management of the three ‘P’s: People, processes and (computer) programs. This paper examines critical issues for managing each entity. It discusses the importance of developing trusting organizations, the requirements of process change, how to implement technology in harmony with the organization and the significance of vision.

Pedreira and H. F. Marin   The science development and technology application improvement in all areas of knowledge, including health care, represent an advance in patient care. The health care providers face challenges to accomplish complex procedures and treatments, which demand infrastructure, defined framework, constant process establishment and redesign of nursing care, based on a continuous outcomes evaluation. Therefore, this development requires nurses with advanced knowledge and skills. As the main health care provider in Brazilian hospitals, the nursing staff perform and control the majority of direct patient care procedures, and as such, nursing professionals can be responsible for triggering adverse events that can compromise patient safety. Research conducted in Brazil showed that the quality of health care delivery system and the results of care have significant variation nationwide. Health care professionals should be valued as the one who can promote patient safety, providing high quality care within cost-effective services. Technology is a key element to support and enhance the professional’s performance. However, it is also important to promote and facilitate its implementation and development to retain a creative, engaged, skilled, satisfied, competent, and accountable professional capable of identifying and using technology resources in order to assure the quality of care for the population.

Method: Nurses have an obligation to support and ensure continuity of patient care and to prevent an information gap when patients are transferred from one organizational of health care delivery to another organizational level, for example, from hospital to home health care. In an ongoing prospective study, nurses’ pre-electronic nursing discharge note and their assessment of the information it was necessary to exchange at the same time was audited and analyzed.   The results show variation in the completeness and content of the nursing discharge note. Nurses’ understanding of the scope and content of information to be transmitted varies widely according to the context and the organizational health care level they work within.   The implementation of an electronic nursing discharge note creates the opportunity to identify the accurate information elements that must be documented and exchanged between the nurses to ensure patient safety and inter-organizational continuity of care.

Ted Klein, Jossie Paguntalan, W. Dan Roberts and Michael Soupios   The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Committee on Quality of Health Care in America identified the critical role of information technology in designing safe and effective health care. In addition to technical aspects such as regional or national health information infrastructures, to achieve this goal, healthcare professionals must receive the requisite training during basic and advanced educational programs. In this article, we describe a two-pronged strategy to promote patient safety through an informatics-based approach to nursing education at the Columbia University School of Nursing: (1) use of a personal digital assistant (PDA) to document clinical encounters and to retrieve patient safety-related information at the point of care, and (2) enhancement of informatics competencies of students and faculty. These approaches may be useful to others wishing to promote patient safety through using informatics methods and technologies in healthcare curricula.

Grobe   Redefinition of roles and functions in the healthcare systems of the future requires embracing to the value of continuing education. Within this framework healthcare professional education and continuing education, there are several core competencies described by Institute of Medicine (IOM) [A.C. Greiner, E. Knebel (Eds.), Health Professionals Education: Bridge to Quality, IOM, available at  urlLink http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10681.html , May 2003] that form the foundation for practice for nurses and other healthcare professionals. An overarching sentence in the document says "All health professionals should be educated to deliver patient-centered care as members of an interdisciplinary team, emphasizing evidence-based practice, quality improvement approaches, and informatics" (p. 45). These IOM core competencies are:   (1) Common value for respecting patients’ differences, values, preferences and expressed needs.  (2) Ability to cooperate, collaborate, communicate and integrate care using interdisciplinary teams.  (3) Knowledge of and willingness to employ evidence-based practice principles.  (4) Capability to apply quality and safety improvement approaches in care.  (5) Understand, value and use informatics to all areas of health care, to reduce errors, manage knowledge and information, and make decisions and communicate.   In enveloping these core competencies in basic and continuing education, it is necessary to build an evidence base for education itself, demand that faculty are prepared for the future. A crucial need is for healthcare professional students (including nursing students) learn interdisciplinary collaboration in the education of patients. A global strategy, using these competencies for preparing faculty is necessary; and some models already exist that can be further developed to meet future needs that are informatics driven in our increasingly technological future care systems.

If the degree of anonymity of a disseminated data set could be measured, it would be possible to design algorithms that can assure that the desired level of confidentiality is achieved. Privacy protection in disseminated databases can be facilitated by the use of special ambiguation algorithms. Most of these algorithms are aimed at making one individual indistinguishable from one or more of his peers. However, even in databases considered "anonymous", it may still be possible to obtain sensitive information about some individuals or groups of individuals with the use of pattern recognition algorithms. In this article, we study the problem of determining the degree of ambiguation in disseminated databases and discuss its implications in the development and testing of "anonymization" algorithms.

G. Pedreira, Abel Paiva, William Goossen and David W. Bates   When people become patients, they place their trust in their health care providers. As providers assume responsibility for their diagnosis and treatment, patients have a right to expect that this will include responsibility for their safety during all aspects of care. However, increasing epidemiological data make it clear that patient safety is a global problem. Improved nursing care may prevent many adverse events, and nursing must take a stronger leadership role in this area. Although errors are almost inevitable, safety can be improved, and health care institutions are increasingly making safety a top priority. Information technology provides safety benefits by enhancing communication and delivering decision-support; its use will likely be a cornerstone for improving safety. This paper will discuss the status of patient safety from an international viewpoint, provide case studies from different countries, and discuss information technology solutions from a nursing perspective.

Design: Develop a process for document development, review, and approval that includes best evidence from research and input from clinical experts. Results: After six years of development, the electronic reference InfoBase (a searchable online reference manual which provides easy access to standards for clinical practice throughout the organization) contains over 700 interdisciplinary patient care standards (e.g., protocols, procedures, standards of care) and over 1000 "information chunks" (e.g., assessments, instructions, scales, tables, graphics) that support consistency in care delivery. All documents have been written, based on the best evidence available from research and reviewed by a group of clinicians at IHC facilities and approved for use throughout the company. An example of how standardization of interdisciplinary standards can improve patient safety in the area of falls is also included.   Author Keywords: Interdisciplinary care standards; Patient safety; Information chunks      Development of a compositional terminology model for nursing orders   Pages 625-630  Susan Matney, Catherine Dent and Roberto A. Rocha   Aim: Develop a compositional terminology model for nursing orders that would conform to the existing standard health level seven (HL7) messaging standard for clinical orders. Develop and evaluate the set of attributes needed for a pre-coordinated concept for a single nursing order, using a replicable three-step modeling process. Results: A terminology model for nursing orders was developed using empirical data. The model was validated against nursing research and standards literature, and evaluated using 609 nursing orders that were successfully mapped to the structure. The representative services came from 20 Intermountain Health Care (IHC) hospitals, demonstrating the generalizability of the model and its attributes across many care settings.

Mendonça, Elizabeth S. Chen, Peter D. Stetson, Lawrence K. McKnight, Jianbo Lei and James J. Cimino   Evidence suggests that inadequate access to information and ineffective communication are proximal causes of errors and other adverse events in-patient care. Within the context of reducing these proximal causes of errors, we explore the use of novel information-based approaches to improve information access and communication in health care settings. This paper describes the approaches for and the design of extensions to a clinical information system used to improve information access and communication at the point of care using information-based handheld wireless applications. These extensions include clinical and information resources, event monitoring, and a virtual whiteboard (VWB).

Roemer, Stephanie J. Richardson, Roberto A. Rocha, Guilherme Del Fiol and Richard L. Bradshaw   A computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system can provide an efficient means of retrieving and consolidating order lists from multiple electronic clinical practice standards and protocols. However, the consolidated order list may contain exact duplicate or overlapping orders. Benner’s framework for levels of nursing expertise can be used to explicate the variability of the nurse’s responses to redundancies in order lists and the potential compromise to patient safety. An exploratory case method was performed to consolidate 74 orders from 11 sources. The consolidated order list contained 35% fewer orders after the redundant orders were removed. Our work has shown that many redundant orders may arise by consolidating order lists from multiple electronic standards. It is imperative that consolidated electronic order lists be manageable by the nurse according to their level of clinical and computer expertise, and that redundant orders are resolved before being displayed to the nurse.

S. Ortega and Abelardo de Q. -C. Araújo   Measures of functional levels, commonly used to assess the safety and quality of life of individuals and populations, have not yet been derived from a fuzzy framework. The aim of this study is to estimate the degree of disability associated with varying functional levels, through a model based on fuzzy sets theory. A fuzzy linguistic model was developed to measure varying levels of functional disability, in accordance with the definitions of an individual’s social and physical activities and mobility. One year of an adult’s life whose mobility, social and physical activities were somewhat limited, was judged to be equivalent to 0.575 years free of functional disability. Results obtained from the fuzzy model approach those obtained with the quality of well-being scale (QWB), used as a conceptual framework. Such findings are encouraging, since the QWB is considered a consistent and valid approach for disability assessment and quality-of-life evaluation.

Newbold, Gilad J. Kuperman, Suzanne Bakken, Patricia Flatley Brennan, Eneida A. Mendonca, Hyeoun-Ae Park and Aleksandar Radenovic   This article describes the process utilized to create research questions which promote technology as an infrastructure to enable safe nursing practice. Beginning with scenarios of safety problems related to nursing practice, the team identified information technology including hardware, software, and organizational and operational components to help improve the safety aspects addressed in the scenarios. Further discussed are characteristics of technology necessary at each step in the nursing process and finally recommendations are presented for various research questions that would be needed to enable research on the use of the proposed technologies.
