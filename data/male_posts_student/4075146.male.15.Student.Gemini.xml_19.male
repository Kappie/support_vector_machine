Now for the important stuff...I met with Mike Sosonkin, part of Poly's DOJ (Design Obfuscator for Java) project, to discuss obfuscation so I can get some preliminary results for tomorrow. Pointless as it may be, the program wants results, so whatever, I'll get them something...he showed me how to use DOJ, and how to get the data he's collected already--namely the runtimes for obfuscated and unobfuscated programs. That's about half of my experiment right there, so the results should be easier to get now. I just need to repeat the EXACT obfuscation Mike used for each specific set of results. Anyway, I have to hurry to make the train--shalom!
