I got like... 3 hours sleep last night, because I simply couldn't get to sleep, we'll leave the reason why out of it. And I haven't been feeling well, my head's been splitting and my brain's not working properly today,it's all not fun. Found out I was one of the worst in the class in maths, which was... I suppose to be expected. It was raining really hard while I was doing my papers, and to cap it all the senior drama group production clashes with a CAYO thing at the Pump Rooms. So everything can just go and die today, I can't cope with it all at the moment.  I was kinda hoping Laura'd be on, I really like talking to her, but she wasn't, so I'm kind of bored, and a little annoyed at the day. I mean, I wouldn't show it with her, but I'd still be annoyed. I haven't had the best of days. Then again, neither has she *hugs*.  ...And Mr. Pickard's arsed up my 4 hours of work on the light entertainment, saying that I can do it "another time". I'm going to have to have words with him, I think. Probably like this; "With all due respect, fuck the hell off." I can't cope with losing 5 hours for no real reason. He can do his Flanders and Swann in his house if he really wants to do it, this is the thing I'm in control of.  But you know, on major plus, might be seeing Laura a coupla times next week. Which would be unbelieveably cool. It would certainly make up for today being a big pile of awful.  [No quote today.]  Love, Jon Roskilly
