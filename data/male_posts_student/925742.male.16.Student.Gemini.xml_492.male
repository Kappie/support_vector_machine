But it really is great.  I sailed and I did so much walking, and so many beautiful things.... nature. Not to mention these two girls from the UK, hehehhe.  Thats another story.  It turns out that those Dutch relatives of mine didn't take everything and the kitchen sink!  Good for them.  Its crazy, really, how fast they grow up!  I don't remember them being so mature.  Little Jasper (ya-sper) is 10 years old!  Imagine that.  He has studied English for only one year and can communicate quite well!  He's a smart one, and he's not as much of a spazznoid/jerk as he was before. Martaijn is quiet, probably because he's hitting puberty, hah.  He's .....12... or 13 now...  yeah, he's cool. And little Peter has a little knowledge of English, but is apparently dyslexic!  I don't understand why his parents (my uncle and aunt Jeroen and Renate) worry so much about the kids academically so much.  Jeroen is fine, and since last year managed to keep the weight off!  Renate is still... Renate.  Hahhah.  Oh well.  Good people.  One day we were talking about his job, and he discussed with me Holland's janked up system.  Its janky.  Though there's not as much sueing there, if you own a business, you're responsible for EVERYthing that happens to your employees and therefore must pay lots of insurance.  The rich gotta pay a lot of money and such to benefit those that lack job skills.  Oh well, kinda like here, I guess.    One day, while I was sailing, I lost my wet shoe.  The ocean is a cruel bitch-mother, she is.  Grand, yet brutal.  I had to buy another pair of wet shoes, but those buggers give me blisters.  I need to strengthen my feet.  Wow, I just realized that I already posted that 6 days ago!  Hahha.    Florida isn't as hot as you may think around this time... its only in the upper to mid 80's.   In accordance with my everlasting nerditude, I played lots of Final Fantasy and beat Kirbys Adventure for the NES (which, is completely and utterly trippy/awesome). I took plenty of pictures of the scenery and a few of my relatives.  Very good stuff.  Halfway through the week, Sonja and Ryan came down.  My dad and mom picked them up from.... Fort Lauderdale?  I guess.   I think I have a new mathematical theory in regards to Ryan. x=wz^2 + n       where x is the amount of times a day he makes fun of my choice in girlfriend and w is our age difference and z is the amount of time we've been dating.  N is her ethnicity (the numerical value being what letter their birth country is   america = a = 1).    Bogus, eh?  I think no matter who I date, I'm gonna be given a hard time.  He and Sonja have been working quite hard on wedding invitations.... buh. Did I say that those three cousins only eat meat?  Yeah.... thats all.  But they're completely thin...... I think, then, that the Atikins diet works.... even though they've been on it before it was ever 'invented'.  I met some nice kids on thursday and we socialized.  Two were 14 and from the UK.  And looked quite... ahem.... mature.  We discussed British music and such.  But I did tell them I had a girlfriend (don't worry Ashley, heh) Some of the kids did martial arts and we talked and stuff.  Really cool.  I got some pictures of em, too.  I watched a lot of Spike TV and am very fond of Most Extreme Elimination Challenge!  Those rebdubs are HILARIOUS!  Yesterday morning I must've woken up about 6 times, due to very realistic dreams of us all getting ready to leave the condominiums and packing up.  I fell for that about 3 times.  Some other dreams included me being in a massive zombie fight, and moving out of a house in a city.   Iunno.  Miami international airport is a freaking ZOO.  Enough said.  Well, actually... not enough.  My dad and I l had to leave yesterday, and at the airport we ate some sushi.  It was FECKIN GOOD!  It was like a little tray of 12 rolls (rice and tuna/salmon) with wasabi.  Cheap, too!  And I'm not sick today.    On one of the flights home, I finally got to see Big Fish!  What a great movie.  Steve-o and I were getting teary eyed in the end.  One of those great father son bonding moments.  *SHUT UP, guys*.  There was like a little touch screen tv in the seat in front of me!  So cool.  On the road home from Kansas International, we ate grilled stufft burritos and listened to classic rock.  Good stuff.  He and I like a lot of the same bands from that era.  Now its just me and him until Saturday.  Me and the good doctor.  Maybe we can see Hellboy!  I think I'm a very lucky person.  Pcture this.  White.... rich(ish) family..... educated....live in heartland america.... girlfriend thats everything....chance to vacation and see the world....  I wonder a lot: WHY?!  I see so many other people that don't get these things and here I am....  just the chance I was born in the right place at the right time.  I ponder that.  SURVEY TIME!  Just because I like making HUMONGOID blogs. 1.Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says: "Display(HUD).  Keep an eye on your HUD to keep in touch with the"  2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?: mid air.  If I moved more to the left  would touch another chair.  3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?: The Jewel of the Nile on comedy central  4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is: 11:15  5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 11:22 ( I have an extremely distorted sense of time, when I was young, I never understood the concept of a second)  6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear? Well, aside from the fans/hard drives of my computer tower, I can hear Megadeth - Vortex (good song)  7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?: from inside? I was leaving KCI airport to wait for a blue bus to take me and daddy-o to our car  8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?: Before Blogger... Alex Peterson's Xanga.  9: What are you wearing?:  Stained wife beater and checkered boxers.  I look so much like a stereotypical disheveled man right now.  10: Did you dream last night?  I forgot!  I usually try not to forget.  11: When did you last laugh? When The streets were playing and Terry was gonna batter someone.  12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?: French painting, grandma's quilt, Spike, the punk rock kitten with a spike collar on its neck (its a poster), another quilt, a poster of a Japanese Macaque monkey with a snowball,  two of eleanor's depressing paintings, another of her paintings with lightning, a mirror, balloon paintings, glass..... mexican hats??  And an old OLD OLD Lifesavers advertisement: "They're as pure as the driven snow!  Won't you try one?  You're bound to like them- they have such a dainty, refreshing sweetness.  Everybody likes Lifesavers, because they  taste  so good.  And they're so clean and crisp in their tight little tinfoil packages.  Just the sort of sweets you want."  I can't help but laugh.  13: Seen anything weird lately?:  In a terminal transit in Dallas, I sat across a girl who looked EXACTLY LIKE ASHLEY.  And then, someones cell phone rang and they said "Oh, hey Ashley!" WHICH WAS WEIRD.  Speaking of Ashley, my parents were watching star wars episode two and they say you look like natalie portman.  I would post a picture here, but that would ruin the flow of the quiz.    14: What do you think of this quiz?: i like it  15: What is the last film you saw?: Big Fish  16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: guns  17: Tell me something about you that I don't know: I used to be skinny  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: Make everyone realize they need to recyvle moe and be friendlier to the planet   19: Do you like to dance?: yes  20: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?:  Katalina....
