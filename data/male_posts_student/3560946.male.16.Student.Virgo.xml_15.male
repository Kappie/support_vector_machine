     
      Welcome to the Web Log for the Republic of Lavalon, a small (but growing) micronation located in various places all over the globe, as well as across the internet!  This site has been created to allow Lavalon's citizens, as well as guests, to interact with one another in a free and relatively unfettered net environment.  Lavalonians have had some difficulties interacting with one another of late, given some technical difficulties on the Lavalon forums.  Hopefully, this web log will make it more possible for Lavalonians to interact with fewer obstacles and impediments.  If you're a citizen of Lavalon, welcome to the Web Log!  Take out an account here and post as soon as you have something to say!  Hopefully, we'll have some material built up on this site soon which will interest others who might just be passing by.  If you're just visiting, feel free to drop us a line, and enjoy looking around this site.  Zachary Klaas President of Lavalon
