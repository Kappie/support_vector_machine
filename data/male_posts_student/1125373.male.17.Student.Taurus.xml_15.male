Man i wish i could go to colorado...hike up a hill...find an open spot...lie down and watch the sky...  nature untouched by the cruel modernized world the place i want to be so quiet so still so peaceful the wind giving me chills the silence that makes me hear my own thoughts the night sky comforting my troubles making me forget im real that i exist that i am alone like im living a dream in reality all this in one place one place i can call my own my way to escape everything and thats exactly where i want to be   hey not depressing this time go me! whoo! Hey Chris!!! be happy!!! cuz i am for some strange hyperactive reason....anywho bye bye!
