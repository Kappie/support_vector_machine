Internet Movie Database  urlLink reviews  are fraught with spoilers and run hot and cold; very few are luke warm. We thought it was hot, but we're still asking ourselves if we really did see what we thought we saw. It rains cats, dogs and other things.  Especially  other things.  This film is not your ordinary Hollywood production and may not, in fact, be your cup of tea. You'll either love it or hate it. If you're not afraid of being completely confused for a while (or for, say, the rest of a day), check it out. ...or don't. You have been warned.
