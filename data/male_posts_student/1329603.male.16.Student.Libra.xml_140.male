We're rude most of the time, often we're heartless, almost always we're stupid. A lot of girls I know have bitched about how blokes are stupid to me. Am I supposed to assume I'm excluded? No. I'm a bloke too. Anything said in general about man comes off for everyone, and I believe I'm included in that.  I declare it: boys are NOT stupid. Call me a prick for saying so but there are good ones of us out there. Scott, Buzzy, Brendan, Ging, Tobin, Tom and Sam, Alastair Stanley, Sam Taunton... these aren't average blokes. Maybe the average guy is a git. But spare those who aren't.  Love, Jon Roskilly
