The ironies children the ironies! It was pretty funny I had luke over to watch some movie tonight i had to leave the roo when an ad for the recruit came on, i was worried i might blush to death!  As for confusion i came online to find sam online, and i typers out a long boring message about my day, involving cuts 'n' what not. i looked at my contact list because it looked like sam was away ... then i looked up the list and sam was online... i know two sams...
