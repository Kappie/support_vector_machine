Not the most popular band, but one that is fitting my mood especially well.   Today i just bought my third movie of all time. Ipurchased  City of God  directed by Fernando Meirelles. A beautiful movie i must say. In fact i said to myself the day i watched it: "Self, you have to buy this movie when it comes out." Life is about fulfilling promises to one's self right? Ill leave that for others to answer.   I must say, its nice to fiddle around with technology after two solid weeks of doing Numerical Analysis homework problems. Numerical Analysis?...what is that? I found a definition of Numerical Analysis:  The method of approximation and interpolation of equations that dont have closed form mathematical solutions.  Pretty slick definition, eh? I like it. In fact i would tattoo it on my left cheek (the lower one) if it were not for the pain it would cause me. I already have enough pain from the class. I think if i had any more, i would develop some kind of post-traumatic syndrome, after thecourse of course. I have developed some rather fancy Excel spreadsheets that can compute Hermite Polynomials and use the Newton Interpolatory Divided-Difference Formula. Copies are available at a small charge :) You know, after spending hours and hours doing math, ive decided that math is one of God's favorite subjects. Consider for example the Fibonacci Sequence. It is described by     F 0  =1, F  1  =1,   and   F  n+2   = F  n   + F  n+1          Its terms occur naturally in many botanical species, especially those with petals or scales. For example, look at a pinecone and look at the patterns of the petals. They grow in a pattern described by this sequence, like such: 1,2,3,5,6,13,21,34,55,89, etc. Now that is something amazing. There is also a  Golden Ratio attributed to the Fibonacci Sequence. (Dont you just love the names that mathematicians come up with?) The golden ratio can be used to describe a spiral. Its rather hard to explain how and i dont want to further risk getting "some kind of post-traumatic syndrome." Maybe i will put a picture some time showing it. Or you can watch the movie  Pi . In it, the guy talks about this at one point. I really have grown to appreciate that movie since taking this class. And i think my final point is, for tonight, that God is in numbers some how. Maybe doing math is like reading the bible? Hebrew letters are also numbers you know.   Its now a considerable time later, and the tracks of Mogwai are running low. Peace.
