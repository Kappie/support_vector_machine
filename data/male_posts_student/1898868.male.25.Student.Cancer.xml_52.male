Part of the issue with my chafing was that until the marathon I didn't have any good shorts to run in. I would wear basketball shorts, and either boxers or no underwear at all. Eventually I got boxer briefs, and that made it better, and then for the actual run I had real running shorts and had no problems.   Tonight I'm having dinner with Pyka, who now works at a bakery that was just voted the #1 bakery in San Francisco by the newspaper (the same article, incidentally,voted Jamba Juice the best place to get a non-alcoholic drink)!   Chairman, I don't get back until the 12th. Bad timing... And once again, as for Stick, he adamantly insists that "Bagel never invited me to join the blogger."
