From what I've seen so far it's well worth it, especially when you're getting the DVD for free in the long run!  The DVD's has 6 or so playable demos for games like RalliSport Challenge 2, Top Spin, Crimson Skies, Project Gotham Racing 2, Amped 2, Sudeki, and some others. It also has a slew of game trailers, not to mention the juicy gameplay footage and interviews, etc. on fable!  If you haven't already pre-ordered this game, go do so, it's money well invested!
