Though I didn't see many Brando films, I did see the amazing "Wild One" and loved it! That film made me wanna buy a leather-jacket from the Goodwill and buy a motorcycle. It was that great!   I wish I had more to write about this amazing actor, but I need to see more of his films. Well, I'll see ya'll later.   Marlon Brando (1924-2004)
