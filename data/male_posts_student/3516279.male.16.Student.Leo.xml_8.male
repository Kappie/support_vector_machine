I have to go to church and help clean it up  For some reson I wake up at 6:00 in the morning No good TV shows so I just do crunches and lift weights and now i am feeling the after effects   My Grandma just left out the house for the third time first she forgot her car keys then her check book then left her door key  I have the new Yahoo Messenger but for some reason I cant put clothes on my Avatar ( a little person in corner of screen) Plus the y dont have a caramel color it even has insults and goodbyes Isaiah should know I laid some on him hahahahahahahhahaha  My eyes are glazin over so I should go  Peace Love and Happiness
