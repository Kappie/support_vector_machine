Everyone who is someone wants to be " THE ONE" .Laloo wants DPM  Home Ministry,Karunanidhi wouldn't mind becoming DPM, Sharad Pawar wants DPM and/or Defense.Pranab Mukerjee doesn't want Finance but will settle for nothing less than home.JMM wants the coal. Dayanidhi Maran is gunning for Industries portfolio.Paswan wants communication.RJD wants Railways.                       I feel sorry for Manmohan Singh. He has a tough job in hand with so many demanding allies (most of whom are utterly incompetent to make matters worse).Manmohan would be better served if he does a crash course on handling allies from his former boss P.V.Narasimha Rao , who was an expert at it.                        The act of cleansing politics is a slow process which might take decades to happen but I hope it happens one day .
