For some reason I'm really thinking something supernatural is going on right now, around, with, and through me.  Here are some odd things that have been happening:  Yesterday in the cafeteria during fifth period, Caleb told me across the table that he had a question for me. I said "Okay" but he said it was private.  All day while I was at school today, there didn't seem to be anyone there; I hardly noticed the presense of students although it was a full and regular school day for grades 5-11.  My cat was killed two days ago. (BTW, if you pick up a copy of today's  Tennessean  you can find a letter to the editor that I wrote about dogs killing my cats.)  This evening I was walking out of a darkened room and my phone's backlight was on (not the weird part). The weird thing was how there appeared to be a light trail around my phone that followed it. I logically deduced (through some experimentation) it was simply the backlight playing tricks on me, but when it first happened, and afterwards, I was really freaked out.  For the past few days, Camille has been "really sick" and out of reach by phone -- she's been over at Ms. Susan's house because her house's air conditioning is broken, right? Well, I have not spoken with Camille in three or four days and not with her family in two days. For the past few days, when I've really been needing someone to talk to, no one has answered their house phone and her cell phone has been cut off. Where are you, Camille?  I just don't know what's up, and none of these things may seem weird to you at all, but for some reason they are all striking me as highly unusual.  I'll keep y'all posted, if I can ...
