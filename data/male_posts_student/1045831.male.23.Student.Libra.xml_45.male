The cancert sucked..  It was real cheesy and filled with rednecks..  a terrible time and 4 hours of driving on top of that but ohh well she's my sister so gotta give her some love..  Sat I worked all day and made some much needed cash and then went to party up in lawrence for rock chalk.. Claudia came up and it was fun..  Sun I worked all day again what a surprise..   then Monday I took my Midterm in West Civ 2 that I didn't study for because of all the other stuff in my life but still think I did real well on.. not a big deal cuz I took it pass fail but still makes a brother feel good to know I did well..  then that night McKay came up so i went to the wheel and kicked it with him.. That was cool and makes me look forward to April when I will be up kicking it with him in Yale and in NYC with Rife..    But i'm back to work and would like to end this entry from a quote by the King of Late night himself, Johnny Carson, "My success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day."  And thats what I'm back to doing.. Peace out brotha's, The Zekemeister...
