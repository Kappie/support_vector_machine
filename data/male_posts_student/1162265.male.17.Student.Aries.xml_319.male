Now I think the best thing would be either to get that African symbol "There is nothing to fear but God" despite my millitant 'I dunno' world view. Or else I could get a Vever drawing for Legba or if I was lucky I could find one for Oggun, Chango, or a Ghede (Baron Samedi?). If you didn't figure that out Vever drawings are drawings used in voodoo ceremonies. I don't know if they like tattooing but voodoo is pretty damn open about things.
