I'm a little excited but I dont know... theres always some kind of thing that your thinking of... behind all the good... if that makes sense... like all my classes are cool and good this year (I guess) but I mean you never know whose in those classes so I may know the classes I have.. but it doesnt mean I'll actually like them. like next tri I have a class with Nick Kagy :S god I hate him so much... I mean Julie's in that class too but still :S. I'm a little nervous about the whole freshmen thing too... I mean I know I sound like a complete wimp, I mean why should I be affraid of some freshmen... but I am... its just the girl down the street that will bother me... I dont know if she will or not.. but I'm hopeing that she won't and I pray to god that shes not in my drama class!!!  well listen to me rambling on about my schedule and you dont even know what it is...  FIRST TRI  1. US history a  (I'm not sure who my teacher is right now) 2. not sure yet either.. it says I have Expressives but I need to change that 3. computer applications    Al Kolarik 4. Drama a    Tobie Henline 5. advanced algebra a   Dawn Justice  SECOND TRI  1. no hour 2. again it says I have expressives but I dont know 3. US history b     Phil Anderson 4. Drama b    Tobie Henline 5. English 11a     Patsy Smith  THIRD TRI  1. yearbook production (dont know on this one either) 2.Expressives C (ugh.. same I dont know) 3. English 11b  Patsy Smith 4. open hour 5. Advanced Algebra b    Ron Webber :S  so I really dont know what I'm going to do with all the open hours.. I bet if I didnt go in to talk to the conserler guy I could actually get those hours off... but no.. I'll probably go in and do it anyway beacause I need to find out what I'm doing!!! the big thing that I need to decide on is Expressives or photo Journalism... I'm leaning on the expressives side but god, I dont want that class to suck! and I know it will! she put so many bad singers in that class and its going to make it fall to the ground so much... but all my friends are in that class and its an easy class to take... plus I might have a LITTLE bit of fun... so thats what I'll probably do... well, I need to go.. and think, plus I'm really hungry, later  nyny
