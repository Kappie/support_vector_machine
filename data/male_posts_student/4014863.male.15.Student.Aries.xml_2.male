All my life between being raised in downtown kelowna to Mindy Trann's kidnapping, to my less than sane father and being a fair skin blonde (kidnapper's favorite target)  I WAS TRAINED TO AVOID OUTSIDE!  so now maybe people will understand why I don't go outside!   And leave me alone!   That settles it eh?
