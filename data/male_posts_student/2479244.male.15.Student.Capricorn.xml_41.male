My opinion is my own and you are in no way forced to believe or, for that matter, read this.   God is not real.  The only real proof anyone has of his existence is a lengthy book that has been translated hundreds of times over and composed by dozens of authors -- and that's where it end.  A book.  I am sorry, but a man-written book is nothing more than a fairytale. For all matter, I could pick up the book  Clifford  and say that it was written by a respected, "truthful" writer of the times who was under the influence of the powers of the red dog, and by god (or rather, Clifford,) someone would believe it. The proof that is the Bible is simply unsubstantial for such a radical, farfetched idea like "God."   Furthermore, what exactly is "God's" problem with humanity? He 'creates' us and then punishes us for functioning as he made us. That is some seriously fucked up shit right there. That's the same as building a robot that is made to cut glass, and then telling him that cutting glass is against the principle of you. You may as well have just built the robot to sit there and do nothing.   In all honesty, the "God" in the Bible is extremely egocentric and paranoid. He basically tells people that he will slay anyone who disagrees with his ultimate power and then when people built the tower of Babel, he felt challenged and destroyed it and cursed them all.  Way to fucking go.  It doesn't stop there. He tortures people, destroys them over and over because he is unsatisfied with his "meager" work because his abominations are functioning as they were built. Humans were created in his image, so says the Bible, and that would be the one thing that would explain our irrational, violent, self-centered, attention craving, superficial emotions. Now, that in no way rationalizes the Bible -- I'm just using the text that I so disagree with as my weapon of critique.  The thing about religions like Christianity is that they have been so rigidly grafted into our society that it is everywhere around you. Take out a dollar bill, listen to the pledge of allegiance, hear a person cuss at another person, watch a porn... they all mention "God" at least once. That is why God is seen as such a simple, understandable concept in our society. You hear his name hundreds of times from the time you are little to the time you are big enough to think. There is absolutely no proof of his existence. As I have said before, I would like to see a child be raised and see if this human discovers the concept of "God." If he were so powerful, would his influence not stretch out to our consciences?   God is just a concept that frightened, confused human beings made up long ago, and it has since been enforced and perverted by modern society. Every time you turn around people are mentioning it, trying to  convert  you. It is funny that its called conversion, like you are somehow not a part of the group, regardless of the fact that "God" supposedly "made" you. All that the religion is is simply a crutch for manipulation and greed. The Church is the absolute richest organization in the world, and to me, that says at least  something  about that damned concept. But it doesn't matter, I will always be surrounded by these religion enforcers until I move to some non-western influenced area. Until then, I will be forced to put my trust in a concept that is total bullshit.  And that, "God's" sheep, is why your big buddy is a  fucking fake.   Now get his name off my money.
