Last friday, like I said in my last entry, I was going to my HR interview with Legacy Marketing Group at 10am. I get there a bit early and Jennifer takes me to an interview room and the interview was pretty much just a list of questions. She wrote my answers down and it was painless and smooth. Almost all the Questions were "Describe a specific time when..." She told me at the end of the interview that there were a few other jobs available and if I was interested in those, she would like to consider me for those posistions as well. Both jobs are entry level help desk and the other entry level batch operator. I said I was interested because I really don't have the liberty of picking and choosing what job I would like at this point.  They said they would like to combine both part time positions for me and I would be working from 1 - 10 M-F. That schedule will be perfect when I start back to school. Anyways, she walked me out and said they would be making a decision for a team interview in the next week and a half.  After that, I go out to mimi's work, tell her the news and change clothes. We get everything ready and head to lodi. We pulled into lodi a little after 3pm and just sat around for a while. I was tired, the night before I was so nervous about the interview, I had a hard time getting comfortable. So I crashed in the chair for a little while. Jeremy and his bandmates showed up and started practicing for their show later that night. Around 6-7 they loaded up and we followed them out to Sacto to West Coast Worldwide for their first show. The place was pretty cool. They had a short set that was decent for a first show or a 101st show. I was stoked. After the set, they took all their equipment out to their vehicles and Jeremy and I took the guitars to his friend Nick's truck. Nick didn't have a lock on his camper so we threw em in my back seat for the time being. We were only gonna be a few minutes to talk to some folks and grab Bryan to get some food. When we got back to my car, my right back door window was busted out and all three guitars were gone. I felt so helpless, it sucked, it still sucks. My gut was twisted when I saw what had been done.  $1500 worth of guitars paid for some fucking crackhead tweekers habbit and we were the victims. After a few calls to the police, we got no help from them. They would not come and make a report for such a thing. I have yet to make the police report. I am still waiting on all the info from the guys as fars as how to describe the guitars.  So anyways, I was physically sick, with like bronchitus or something. It was mild at the time, and I thought I was beating it down but after hanging out in the cold for a while and driving 30 minutes with a window gone going 80 miles an hour, I think it started beating me. I was sick as fuck for the rest of the weekend. I rested most of sunday. Mimi and I went driving around.  Most of this week I have been dreaming about getting a motorcycle and trying to pack up for our move next week. I went to a few cycle dealerships and sat on a few cruisers. I'm stoked. I started working on my credit to get some of the false shit off. Hopefully in a few months that will all be cleared up and I can go get a fat bike to cruise on.  I got a call from Jennifer at Legacy Marketing Group a few days ago and she said that they were going to hire an internal employee for the Help Desk posistion but she would like to set up a Team interview for the Batch Operator position. It will be a few dollars less an hour, but a fuck load better than Zales and I am down! Maybe it is meant to be, with school and all coming up.  I hope so. I am royally stoked about all of it. I just need a new window in my car. The duct tape and cardboard is holding up nicly, though. I need to paint a Skull on it for fun!  Sorry about all the errors, Proofreading is for smart people!   current mood:  shocked current music: you and i
