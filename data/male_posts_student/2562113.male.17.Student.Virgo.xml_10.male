She also has a boyfriend." - Reza "::thinks to himself::   i hate girls with boyfriends.. someone finish the quote.. get a cookie!" - Bob  Dec 27- I wake up early (12:30 PM) and take a shower and get dressed. I call Katie and then she comes over with a bunch of video games. We played FFX2, The Sims, SSX3, Harry Potter, and Tekken Tag. She whooped my ass in all the video games : (  I fell in love with one of the characters from X2, her name is Rikku. She is so hot. Hours later.... Adam picks me up in his new 2004 mini cooper and we pimp it all the way to the mall to meet everyone at chili's for dinner with the birthday girl. the wait for food was long, but amusing, it was my first meal of the day and was at around 9pm. but it was fun, dessert was good. Afterwards i had a smutty gathering. I smoked a bowl with Karen in the garage. and then me katie and karen smoked the bong while adam and nick watched. and then i smoked with whitney and colleen. i was retarded. i don't remember much after that .. i passed out on my bed and dreamt about a white monkey with a crusty belly button and some crazy zombie named Nosferatu? wtf  :-p  Dec 28- I wake up late (5 PM).. showered and ate food.. then xavier picked me up and we drove around. we picked more people up. we chilled at pat's for 20 mins and then went on a beer run. there wasn't enough room in the car so michael ferguson got put in the trunk. we got beer and then followed orlando to stont point. he made a U turn and sped away so we said fuck that jagoff. we drive around madison avenue and go fast because of this part in the road that makes the car jump. Terd, i mean mike ferguson almost died in the trunk. it was funny. we go to pats. i drink a 22 fast. i met this kid named Andrew who is a senior at UAlbany. we exchanged numbers so we could meet up and smoke. james walked in, i haven't seen james in a long time. james drives me back home to pick up bong. we go back to pats and i smoke with james, gill, and amanda. i also let joe, andrew, evan, and george take a hit. then i whip out the bowl and me and james smoke more. i then drink another 22. andrew walks in and drives me to wendy's. i need fucking sauce with my nuggets so we drive thru mcdumpster for sauce. the lovely spanish ladies once again pull through and hook us up with food. we bring it back to pats. i eat it all. the party then gets real big. pat's brother kicks people out . me and drew drive around and sell bags. we drive back to wendy's and meet colleen, whitney, and brianne. i ordered cheese fries. we chat and throw food at each other. we then drive to dan griffin's house. we had many treats, i got a special treat. we end up back at pat's house. at that point i am so blasted that i don't know what's going on. andrew drives me home. i am here now mellowing out to music. katie decides she wants to do something crazy and sneaks out of her house. her brother goes on her screen name looking for her. he asks me a bunch of questions and wants them answered immediately. Katie didn't get in much trouble : )  I'm going to mellow out to some Incubus and then call it a night.. tomorrow.. uh later today i mean i have to do something i've wanted to do for a long time... buy clothes.. my worth as a human being depends on it!
