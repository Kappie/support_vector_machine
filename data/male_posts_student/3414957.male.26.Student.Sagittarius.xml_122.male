I am not all for the go out and bang as amny women as you want or can mentallity, but I do agree with my new "father" that the majority of women are gold diggers. Few are not, but then they have their own drawbacks and flaws....like trying to change you into their own "dream" of what a husband or mate should be. "F" all that jazz!!!   It's sad but to have feelings...makes you vulnerable. At least mask them and conceal them so they can never be used agaisnt you.
