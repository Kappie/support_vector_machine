I so suck at all of it, and so it's hard for a mere mortal such as I. And I really need a break, one that won't come until at least the summer. I've got a few months of torture before I can have a proper break... the only people who know the position I'm in I either have no contact with or they're too smug to talk to. I can't cope, to be honest, if you haven't got that from this already.  Major plus side - ordered the 6 tickets for Bill Bailey. June 3rd, come on...  Major downside - being tired means I'm more depressed.  Major downside - I'm still feeling really ill.  Oh well, life continues to be alright. I'm not optimistic like I was a few weeks ago, nothing seems to be good for me just around the corner. But I'm still here. I'm just... Jon. I guess that's the problem.
