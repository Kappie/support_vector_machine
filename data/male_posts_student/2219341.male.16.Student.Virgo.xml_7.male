"she" is sucha goober!  hahahaha!  still sad.  still depressed.  L was really gettin on my case today.  ha!  i love her...she is just so honest.  and she'll just get up in your face and tell you the truth.  which quite frankly i do need to hear sometimes.  i dunno.  she just kinda said that i really had an issue with letting people go and that i really needed to fix it.  i dunno it kinda made me mad.  she's right i need to try and let go.  but its so hard for me.  cuz its never like i lose the feeling.  its never like im the one who's leaving.  its always them.  and im always the one left with feelings.  i wish i knew what it was like to lose the feeling.  L said it was much easier to let go when you're on that side of the break up.  anyways.  ok im in alot of pain.  my chest...is killing me.  i dont even know how to describe it.  im havin a very difficult a conversation.  im going to leave now.  goodnight.
