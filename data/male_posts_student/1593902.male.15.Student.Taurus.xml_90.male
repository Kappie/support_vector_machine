(gas) So let's see, after 6th grade (ok 4th) mindset was piss them off, don't give a shit, just be good to those that are good to you, and be unnafacted. unnatached. now i feel like i gotta be a good person. WTF?! when the hell did i get morals!? So this years mindset is- have 4 god friends, treat meily and carmen and odie, like the queens (and odie-princess) they are. So with the guys i'm fucked. The chicks i'll be okie with. It's gonan be cool being a prick to some people again, people i haven't seen in 5-3 years. hehe. BTW i'm finally dong the last book, and it sucks majour ass. also.....something. lost train of thought. must talk to brandy about life. must make foot awake! anyways let me spinehsnank in p@eace! and if anyone needs me for anything (ok almost anything) IM, call me.  ANOTHER LOSER BORNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!  b0om.
