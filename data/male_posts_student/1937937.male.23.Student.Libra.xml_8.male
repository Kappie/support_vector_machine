Assuming each polynomial equation has finitely many roots, show that the set of algebraic numbers is countable.    The  urlLink fundamental theorem of algebra states  that if P(x) is a polynomial of degree  n , then the equation P(x) = 0 has  n  roots.  Since we know that the roots of the above equation are dependent upon the coefficients (for example, x 1  + a 1  = 0 involves -a 1  as the solution), and since we have the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can say that the number of solutions for a polynomial of degree  n  can be found by taking all possible rational coefficients, and crossing them with a set of  n  elements:  Let A n  be the set Q  Q  Q  ...  Q by {a 1 ,a 2 ,...,a n }, and let B n  be any set of n elements, such as {1,1,...,1}.  We know that the number of solutions for a polynomial of degree n can be found by A n   B n , which amounts the set of  n  sets of rational numbers crossed with a set of  n  elements.  Thus, the union of A n   B n  for all  n  in Z +  gives us all possible algebraic numbers.  Because A n  is a finite cartesian product of countable sets, and B n  is a finite set, the cross product of any given A n  and B n  must be countable (the finite product of countable sets is countable).  Finally, we can say that our countable union of a countable set is countable; thus, the algebraic numbers are countable.  If this proof or any other material contained on this blog appear to be incorrect, please  urlLink e-mail  me!  Thanks.
