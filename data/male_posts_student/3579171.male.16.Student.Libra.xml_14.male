Sadly, 99.9% of the time, the number is the same as the last time I checked.  On the .1% chance occasion that the number did change, I always read it before doing anything else.  Usually, that comment ends up being just random gibberish that even the author of it can not understand, kind of like my posts.  Even though it's just gibberish, it still adds to my infinitesimally minute collection of comments.  I always wonder how come I never get that many comments?  After seconds of strenuous thinking, I came up with two possible possibilities.  First, I don't get lots of comments because no one knows me.  What leads to people not knowing me?  That's when I came up with my second possibility, with the help of Kolina... I think, I can't remember.  Now, before you hear the second, you first have to visit  urlLink this site  because the second compares it to mine.  Now that you've visited her site, the second is that I am not her.  Maybe if I was more like her I might get more comments.  By like her, I mean look like her.  I seriously doubt she would get that many comments if she were a hairy, butt-ugly guy.  Or maybe its her attitude that attracts so many people.  By her attitude I mean her body.  Again, I seriously doubt she would get as many comments if she were not only a hairy, butt-ugly guy but horrendously fat also.  Tell me I'm wrong.  That's right, you can't because you know I'm right.  So now that we've gone over the two possibilities, I've also come up with ways to fix the problem.  First, everytime you visit this site imagine the sexiest, hottest, cutest chick you've every imagined and imagine that she was the author of the site and has hot pictures of herself all over the site.  If you're a girl, imagine the hunkiest, jockiest, most muscular guy you've ever imagined and imagine that he was the author of this site and has topless pictures of himself all over the site showing off his nice muscles.  Second, tell, all your friends about this site.  When you tell them about this site, tell them the sexiest, hottest, cutest chick they could ever imagine is the author of the site and has hot pictures up everywhere.  If their girls just tell them the author is the muscular guy described above.  If your friends happen to be gay instead of sending them to this site, instead send them to  urlLink this one . =P  Now, leave several comments and then leave.  - Some loser
