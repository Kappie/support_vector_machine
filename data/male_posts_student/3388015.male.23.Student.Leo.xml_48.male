The shop was really sketchy, but it was a mom and pop shop and they would repair it the cheapest in the city.  Most other places wanted to charge me over $100 to repair my $300 TV, so no, I'd rather let a short, bald, fat and hairy man fix my television than be overcharged.  The neighborhood was really frightening, with half naked people walking around and them drinking on the streets.  I still didn't feel my best, but I had errands to run, so I went to walmart, picked up some medicine and picked up some other items, stopped by and paid by eye doctor bill, picked up a couple DVDs and then went and picked up my tv.  Wednesday, after work, I went to the Farmington Racing Casino (Racino) with Deb and blew a ton of money.  I only stayed an hour because Laura was having a goodbye party for Luke (they left Thursday) and she got Dino BBQ, so I sped back, picked up Cindy at UR then we sped to her place (her place since Luke is moving and she is staying).  We hung out, had margaritas and ate good food.  Kerri was there and it was nice catching up with her.  Cindy had to leave to go study.  Thursday Cindy and I hung out at my place for the evening.  She had homework, I had to clean.  I cleaned the place from top to bottom and got it ready for the Vakarias, whom I was hosting this weekend.  I planted a bunch of plants and such.  Friday was an all day professional development (waste of) day.  I didn't plan to eat, but when the Italian food came out I couldn't resist.  I sat with Anesa, Katie, Kelly and JB.  So we sat through presentation and presentation.  I lent my laptop for one of their presentations.  The afternoon was a little better.  We had group discussions, I sat with Suzanne OBrien and a couple others and had the best ideas (I'm not being conceited).  I also presented to the bigger group and we dismissed for the day.  I came back to the apartment and Sheila and Dimple arrived as I was changing my clothes.  So we hung out, I let my aunt know I wasn't coming to Grace's birthday party (I was staying to hang out with Sheila and go to Fahrenheit 9/11).  Sheila wanted to go to Golden Port for dinner, but I was sickened by all the food from the day, so Dimple and her left without me.  Cindy asked me to pick her up, so I did and asked to be taken to Golden Port to join them for dinner.  They weren't there, they went to Taco Bell instead.  So we went back to my place and hung out until Shiela came back and picked Cindy up and went and ran errands.  I fell asleep, and waited since we were going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 at 9:30.  They called at 9:30 and said they weren't going to the 930 show that instead would go to the 1020 show at Tinseltown (the most expensive theatre in the county).  They had gone to Golden Port (without me) and wanted me to meet them at the theatre (since Golden Port is all of 3 min from my place).  So I met them at the movie place and they were sold out (we were 10 minutes late as well), so that kinda spoiled the night.  I stayed home tonight (instead of hanging with my family) to hang with Sheila and watch the movie.  So we went back to my place and Cindy wanted to go dancing.  I didn't, I don't enjoy those clubs since I'm a towering, huge, ugly, and undancable white guy. :)  Sheila (rightly so) stayed with me and we watched a movie while Cindy went out with Dimple.  I ordered a pizza and it came after Cindy and Dimple came back for the end of our movie.  We hung out until 3am, and then Dimple took Cindy home.  Saturday I left early to get to my mother's in time to go to my sister's high school graduation.  I helped out a bit to prepare for the party, we had some strawberry daiquiris and went to the school.  It was a long and boring ceremony, but we hung out for pictures and I shook some people's hands, saw a couple people I graduated with and we went back to my mom's place for the party.  The food was good!  Mom knows how to cook (or I'm just really used to her food).  Macaroni salad, pasta salad, pretzel salad, cheese salad, bbq chicken and more strawberry daiquiris.  The cake looked great (it had Molly's picture on it) and tasted good too.  My mom's garden produced at least 16 gallons of strawberries, so I think I'll be eating them until I die.  she gave me a bag of berries and a quart of homemade jelly to bring back with me.  I fell asleep and eventually woke up in time to get going back to Rochester.  We were going to try to see F 9/11 again.  I got back and Sheila, Cindy and Dimple were at Golden Port again (without me) and said they wanted to see the 10:20 showing at Tinseltown.  So I hung out and waited until they got back and we left for the movies.  Luckily, it wasn't sold out again.  We watched it, it was a GOOD documentary.  I'm not a Bush fan, but even if I was, I'd have to question everything I had ever thought about him.  This gave me such insight into everything, it confirmed some of my suspicions and whoa... it showed me stuff that I never ever even considered.  It was well worth the $16 I paid for it (since Cindy forgot to bring money).  Dimple's friend and Dimple came back to our place after we left the movie and we hung out for several hours.  It's nice having cable but my guests get more use out of it than I do.  This morning the Vakarias left and my life has gotten quiet again, which is nice.  Hopefully this will be a day of catching up.
