[+] randy johnson busting out a  urlLink perfect game . mad skillz. [+] reggie miller busting out another  urlLink game-clinching three . mad skillz. detroit should still win, they've got the wallaces to stop jermaine o'neal, and billups and hamilton's scoring can easily negate ron artest's impact. and they got darko! [+] lakers and timberwolves sucks because michael olowakandi sucks. and mark madsen sucks. and sam cassell is injured. [+] i suck at parallel parking. [+] i keep on trying to justify my purchase of my head-heavy carbonex when it's so much easier to hit with a muscle power. hopefully i can strengthen my arm to fully unleash its offensive might. and to beat eugene in diamond pushup contests.   downloaded songs:  [+] on fire -- lloyd banks [+] all falls down -- kanye west [+] 40 oz. -- d-12 (these lyrics suck) [+] ch-check it out -- beastie boys [+] don't tell me -- avril lavigne (these lyrics really suck) [+] time of your life -- green day [+] (i hate) everything about you -- three days grace [+] stutter -- joe f/mystikal [+] are you gonna be my girl -- jet [+] southern fried intro -- ludacris [+] i like that -- houston f/chingy [+] basic thugonomics -- john cena [+] me, myself and i -- beyonce [+] part of me -- linkin park  aaand...your weekly (or so) dose of funnies goodness.   urlLink
