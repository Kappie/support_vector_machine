They were American, they were mobile and they were angry. Angry about America's Left, who they decry as hating America (and it's little buddy, Israel). I read for a while and realised that in a strange way they have actually managed to put together one decent point. Some of the liberals in America are crazy, hypocritical people. I'm inclined to agree. America's left wing "liberals" exist in three forms as far as I can see.   1. What we in Europe call a "conservative". 2. Your average common or garden liberal (not common). 3. Crazy hippies (the subject of this rant).  This third brand of liberals is extremely interesting because they are in no sense of the word, actually liberal.  lib·er·al    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (lbr-l, lbrl) adj.   1. Not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views, or dogmas; free from bigotry.  2. Favoring proposals for reform, open to new ideas for progress, and tolerant of the ideas and behavior of others; broad-minded.  3. Of, relating to, or characteristic of liberalism.  4. Liberal Of, designating, or characteristic of a political party founded on or associated with principles of social and political liberalism, especially in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States.   Let's take a look at AmLibs versus ClassLibs as defined here.  Not limited to traditional attitudes they may be, but bigotry is a different matter. Go to a peace rally some time. Really. A lot of people will be acting normally, but watch what happens if a group of conservatives arrive of the scene, they'll be booed, insulted and in some cases, attacked. This seems rather contradictory for those who espouse peace and freedom of speech, not to mention being predjudiced against the beliefs of conservatives. The second point in the dictionary definition deals with this as well "tolerant of the ideas and behaviour of others", yes, of course, but not if they are right wing, or a zealot, or a Zionist.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not particularly fond of any of the above groups but it's only civil to at least avoid attacking them for pities sake. This bastardisation of liberalism by some to mean "lots of social welfare, affirmative action and political correctness" is horrible and blights the name of proper liberals.  Ill informed rant over.  Cheers.
