Apple, despite their secrecy is in fact running a superbowl ad(not  the recently revamped 1984 Superbowl commercial ), the  new Pepsi-iTunes commercial , an ad for Apple's new 100M free songs promotion. Unfortunately, this Pepsi commercial does not feature the cute little girl or the super-hot girl(Britney) like Pepsi's usual offerings, but instead, recently sued file-swappers. I must admit that this commercial (Set to the song "I Fought The Law" by Green Day) is a very good idea, and should go over well with the masses who will see it today. As for me, time to start hoarding Pepsi.  Does anyone think that New England has inherited the former Rams' Superbowl dynasty?  For any Orwell/Apple fans out there,  check this out .
