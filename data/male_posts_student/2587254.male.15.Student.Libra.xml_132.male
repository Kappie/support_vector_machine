Yes....it is finally over...and once again I will be using the same format for mass blogging like I have with TC and Huntsville. You know, the Ctrl+F feature *Find feature* in your internet browser. So once again, if you wanna jump to a certain spot use the Find feature and type in the date "month/day/year."  Here it goes...   5/22/04   Day 1 of May Camp *and getting there*   So the morning after Friday....I got up around 8am to get everything loaded into my van for May Camp. The morning started off a bit rocky, as my mom was still clinging on to that stupid argument about the gas pump filling thing and was still peeved from the night before, so in the end I did forget to pack my coat as I couldn't exactly think too clearly with her yelling in my ear. So got out of the house as fast as my can, as my dad also couldn't really stand it so we were both working as a coalition to escape the grasp of my house and was on the road in no time. The plan of me goin' to Gavin's on Friday Night and sleeping over and leaving next day kinda got scrapped when I found out that my dad's headin' up there anyways, so yeah that's what happened....went with dad instead of Gavin's family.  So while on the road, we talked and stuff, and somehow I managed to stay awake the whole time and we chatted bout a whole bunch of stuff. Everything from cars, to stuff about life and of course just stupid stuff that I don't remember that well now lol. So one hour passed by real quick.  As mentioned, in no time we were at the Heritage College place in Cambridge. Much to my surprise kinda.....  WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF CAMBRIDGE.  I was kinda finding it funny how our church retreat....well one aim is to be away from our usual everyday distractions of the city life...and have time to relax and just quiet time w/ God....when we are on a main road, across from a Liquidation store and Zehrs supermarket. I found that REALLY interesting. Yet they tell us not to bring electronics. So got out of the car, and helped unload the stuff that my dad brought up in the van plus my luggage also. Getting there first people I saw was Steph, and apparently Calvin and Gavin were over at the supermarket buying supplies for the weekend lol. I said hey, but then had to help set up the sound system for the weekend for the seminars and workshops that the adults had. That took about 40 minutes and after that went upstairs and checked out the place we were at. VERY much like home....but with a few more things like a pool table, fooseball table, and ping pong table, which the kids and teens would revolve around much for the next 3 days. One thing that caught my eye though was the gym. It was REALLLY nice. Couldn't go in at the moment though as it was locked...so went upstairs when Gavin and Calvin also came. Oh yeah and Pau Pau also. So we chilled around for a bit before we were told to head downstairs for lunch.  Lunch today consisted of Chow Faan and some noodles of some sort. Think it was Chau Chow or w/e, I didn't have much of it. I ate most of the Chow Faan lol. So we ate for a bit, then headed upstairs for some free time and then our first Bible study, were we met our youth co-ordinator(s): Lindy and Thea. I say the "s" in braquets as Thea was more of just helpin' w/ the little kids....Lindy did all the Bible Study. For the next few days we would be studyin' the book of Nememiah, and how he rebuilt the city of Jerusalem after permission granted by the Babylonian King and also after it had been razed to the ground. I liked the studies for the week....and the first one for a first one wasn't too bad. Started off with gettin' to know one another, and then poof we were on our way =P.  After the study....FREE TIME! yes we got to use the gym. Me, Calvin, and Gavin played some ball mostly for the whole time, ranging from 3-on-3 to 4-on-4 to other stuff that resembled basketball *American 21 for example.* Heh without Jason there, me and Calvin ruled the courts haha. I actually managed to play post fairly well, and also made a few decent blocks. My stats for my best game was 6 pts, 7 assists, and 5 blocks. As you can see I am not much of a scorer, but I play defense a lot. Also couldn't score many points as shooting from the perimeter...besides the fact my perimeter shot is horrible I also took my glasses off after being whapped in the face by the ball twice and them staying intact, I took them off to avoid any further damage. So all I could really do was play post and shoot from inside the perimeter. I could still block though =P, and since Gavin's shot is a chest pass basically, it's not exactly rocket science to know how to block it. In the end though the team me and Calvin had won, as our one player Roy was REALLY fast, and probably took more rebounds than me lol.  After the balling, Josh and Rebecky finally arrived, and it was dinner, so more eating ^_^. Didn't really like the dinner as the dishes weren't that great to my taste, but meh can't really complain huh? So ate quickly, and ran upstairs again to have some free time before our final Bible study for the night.  Around 830 or so Lindy came up, and we finished the Bible study for today. We would continue on on Sunday and Monday, but for today we were finished. We talked about variables that could stop us from doing this for God, and Lindy used Nehemiah as an example with building the walls back up for Jerusalem to bring pride to God's people *the Israelites* again.  After the study, had some free time, ate some snacks before sleep, then me and Gavin took the leftover Chow Faan and brought it back up to our  room....plus some plates and stuff to eat it and also water to drink. Bedside fellowship was at our place, and so we chilled for a bit, just talked about our day, and also had some prayer time in groups. I was grouped up w/ Dan and Wendy, and like the other groups we talked for a bit before praying. Well not a bit, more like an hour of talking and then prayers lol. Sarah, Josh and Gavin talked for an endless time before starting their prayers, and Becca, Steph and Calvin's group I dunno. So after that, it was basically bedtime, well you know we ate our Chow Faan that was sitting in the oven, and also showered and stuff. Read some of Purpose Driven Life, talked w/ Gavin for a bit, then headed to sleep around 1230 or so. So that pretty much concludes my first day...   5/23/04   Day 2 of May Camp: Thoughts and Doubts   Day two of May Camp I really felt God's presence with us. At times I feel that God's presence isn't always a happy feeling of just like "OOOH HE'S HERE! ALL THINGS ARE HAPPY NOW!" I feel sometimes when God is around, the conversations that I have with my fellow Bro's and Sisters in Christ....they just seem so much more out there. I mean I feel God's there, but it isn't like a happy feeling. It was still cool, but the presence of Him helped us with our conversations, and really got us somewhere in our Spiritual Walk. Today, many new brainstorm ideas would shoot up, and I felt that it was actually a pretty awesome day despite the boredom we faced for 4 hours of the afternoon. Oh yeah Jacky and Carmen also came today *the Leungs* so we had some more people to chill with =P.  My day started at 730am with Josh's dad waking me and Gavin up. I slept in till 8am though, then jumped out of bed and brushed teeth and washed face and all that shabang, get dressed then head downstairs. Unfortunately the clothes I had intended for today got ruined 10 minutes into my day with me spilling some Curry on my clothes, forcing me to change 10 minutes after I had just changed lol. But after that, headed down to the main building for breakfast, and then a Bible study afterwards. Breakfast consisted of making Gavin's smiley face cup breakdance, me spinning the camera around, and a whole bunch of other stupid stuff. We ate, and then headed upstairs for some freetime yet again and then our first Bible Study. Oh yeah Rebecca's hair looked like a gigantic cornrow lol.  We continued with Nehemiah, and talked about how leadership is vital in accomplishing' God's will on this world. Hmm....by today I think Lindy figured out that many of the kids it seems in HYPE don't exactly like praying aloud, well I feel that way at times anyways....not that it's bad but I guess many of us are somewhat quiet, so she prays for us now basically and that's it. So then freetime for a bit, and then dinner.  Freetime was awesome lol. Ping Pong will be remembered with the dumb twists we made to the game. One started by Wendy, was the one where you ahve a category like "movies" and you have to say a movie title while hitting the ball at the same time. It's harder than it sounds....anyways me and Gavin butchered that and began to singing single notes from tunes *like 007 theme* and did that so much we just eventually started getting tired from laughing mor than playing Ping-Pong lol. We watched Veggietales also w/ the little kids for a bit, and me and Josh had a game of checkers. He owned me lol. Dan slept, there was some pool, and fooseball would be the centre of attention for much of the time lol. I'm getting better at it =P.  Oh yeah then game time or sometin' with the rest of the church also. I didn't really like it, though we came in 2nd overall. But it was pretty boring. I won't touch up much about it.  Hmm then dinner. Dinner was like usual....I didn't like it lol.  After dinner though.....UGH SO BORING. We were supposed to have a Bible study, but it got a bit delayed as the little kids were going crazy, and also the church going on there was using the place at the time too w/ us so it was a bit crowded and loud. The little kids are really annoying, especially Jordan and Jacky in my opinion. So with the 2 hours+ we had, many of us moped around and it was pretty boring. Jacky owned Gavin a few times in pool, and then had to leave. Oh yeah me and Gavin were really retarded yet again and we imitated DBZ with a volleyball lol. But after all that fun though....eventually it got boring, which led to a talk that me, Wendy, Dan, Sarah, and Calvin had about how May Camp seemed a bit lame at times. The talk lasted about 30 minutes, and it was kinda funny how originally we told everyone to go back in and 5 of us stay behind to talk about this issue. But it was cool though, Sarah made some pretty cool remarks, which I guess in a way makes me have a different outlook on her. She sometimes seems like as though she just goes along with the ride going to church, but she really does have some pretty sweet ideas. Dan also made some cool points, and in the end I think we really got somewhere in becoming better friends with one another, both Spiritually and just as people.  So finally we started a Bible Study after everything was settled down. We talked a lot about things we could do to help our church and even in our schools, and came up with the idea of the Coffeehouse *er mentioned* and also I brought up my hope of seeing cell groups starting in our fellowship. It was pretty awesome, and also now I'm hoping that we could have the Coffeehouse with WLAC. It'd be kinda cool being able to see the two Alliance Churches in London get together and just get to know one another and bring new Christians to know God. So we had a lot of talk revolvin' around that, and Lindy seemed to be pretty interested with our thoughts. So the hour and a half or so came and went, and then bedtime snacks and then back to our rooms.  Tonight for Bedside fellowship, we just chilled. Didn't have much else to talk about, and Wendy decided to lead us into some games. We played one of those games where you like clap your hands, snap your fingers and stuff and have to say someone's name, except the names switch around depending what chair you're in. And if you screw up, the guys got makeup and the girls got pounds of hair gel. Me, Steph, and Gavin were the survivors lol, and it was hilarious watching Dan, Calvin and Josh being turned into blobs of sparkles, or Sarah's hair turning into a shiny round rock from globs of hair gel. Wendy got the front all spiked up, and Becca....well.....Gavin totally failed with the hair gel so her hair looked pretty much the same lol. Me and Calvin used half a bottle of gel in Pau Pau's hair.....so the spikey part of her hair was literally a bayonet. Good times haha. Hmm if I ever get time to find somewhere to post the pics....or develop em I will lol. So after that time of just screwing around, they had to leave, but me Calvin Gavin Josh and Dan were already in our room so yeah.....we just chilled for a bit before we slept. Talked about a few things in our church, and just reflected about May Camp. All of us agree that the people need to pay much more attention to the kids and us, and also next year some of us may organize this part of May Camp.  Well Dan and Calvin left a bit earlier, but Josh stayed back in me and Gavin's room and we chatted for a bit. Mostly about what we hope to get out of May Camp, or why we are even here. I was at a moment thinking why bother coming here, or how this was a waste, but after thinking about what God's done for me this May Camp and for the others, I looked back on to the greener side of the pasture. I mean, one thing I always wanted to do was meet someone from WLAC, and that got done this May Camp with our co-ordinators from that church. Another thing that I also really thought was a great statement that totally eliminated the thought of money for May Camp out of my mind:  "Would you pay $120 to see another non-believer come into the arms of Christ?"  Josh said that after I was saying how paying that much money for a May Camp seems expensive, but when I think about it now, it isn't. I mean honestly I would give everything I could to see everyone in this world come to Christ, so $120 to pave the way for another believer, definitely =). So after that talk, we ended in a word of prayer, and Josh had to go back to his room to sleep and me and Gavin just chatted for a bit and then also headed for some shut eye.   5/24/04   Happy Victoria Day! Day 3 of May Camp   Er more like 2.5....but point is it was the 3rd day. Today got up once again at 7:30am from a wakeup call from the same person, but I would once again sleep in until 8am. I thought I slept in a lot, until I saw Calvin, who didn't come down to breakfast until after his mom poked him with a balloon constantly until he got pissed lol. He came down around 830 or so, just in time for the start of breakfast. So we ate, cereal and macaroni with ham once again, but no muffins or croissants this time =(. Oh well, quickly ate, had some fun with the camera, and then headed for our first and final Bible Study for May Camp...  We wrapped up Nehemiah, er the part that Lindy was focusing on which was leadership in our church. She left us with a few final words, and we gave her our emails....er me and Josh did so I could send her directory and that was the last of the studies. So for the rest of the time basically for the day, we just had some free time. We had everything though, the Gym, Lounge etc. So wasn't too bad. I played some ball in bare feet *which isn't the coolest thing* and also we had some games of some tag game and just chilled also and stuff.  Well lunchtime finally, and we ate and ate. Final meals, and I didn't really like it lol. All the food had no taste it seemed....well the food I ate lol. The fruits were good though...I had two apples =). And once again the camera fest we had since 3 of us have cams, so yeah we took lots of pics..oh wait Steph's camera also...not a digi but still a  camera lol. Also I decided I'd stay an extra 2 hours and get a ride from Alan back to London. So for the next two hours, we just hung out, took some final pics and stuff, and just made fools of oursleves like our HYPE group normally does =P.  Well eventually the time was up, and after some good laughs, it was time to go. I threw my bag into Alan's Cavalier *shudder* and then the ride back home. He had to take some other people too, so yeah the trunk was quite crowded. The car ride actually wasn't bad though, and I had enough room to sleep still so I'm not complaining =P. Got home around 5ish, and from then till now it's been unpacking, MSN, blogging, and dinner.  Ergh gotta start homework soon though. Well yeah that wraps up my 3 days over the May Two-Four weekend....not exactly like UBER EXCITING....HOLY CRAP I TOTALLY FORGOT! Gavin and Dan's Rave party Joke...  "I want to have a party" "What Kind of party?" *Both turn around* "RAAAAAAAAAAVE PARTY! AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH WHOOOOOOOOO ASLDFLIATOIA HTOIAHGHASILF OSHG HGDB HFH GGH DFJGH F HYJGJSFDTJSDAOIJSHJD;LFGH L;KSJ HOIAH FIHGA HFOIJH JG G JGJPO!"  You have to be there, or see the video.
