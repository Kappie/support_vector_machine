"Wow, those three hours just flew by!" 4. "I wish I had a tape of that lecture, because I'd love to listen to it again, in its entirety!" 5. "If only the professor was less animated when he talked!" 6. "Man, it sucks that it's Friday and no more class until Monday!" 7. "The only thing that would make this class worse is if they gave out free food!"
