But I need to change or my mind will snap and my life will  be lived in MELANCHOLY (like it is anyway).Today was different I went to see  my Bestest budday Emma Louise Webb and we watched buffy classics which was boring in a way 'cause i've seen them a goooogol amount of times.But  it was fun.Anyway with this fellin less of a heavy burden I wish you all a gooooooood life and  remember that the greatest thing you'll eva learn  is just to love and be loved in return (DAMN Moulin rouge)
