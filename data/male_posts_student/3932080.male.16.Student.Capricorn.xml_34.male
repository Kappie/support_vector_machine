We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.     Producer #10 :      The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo)     000000000     Write Up  On a list concerning producers, its nearly impossible to leave off the two masterminds who single-handedly ran the  Billboard  charts in 2003. They did it so well, in fact, that they were a lock-in for that Producer(s) Grammy, which they won in February over a slue of veteran hitmakers. But after that huge victory, the two disappeared. Sure,  N.E.R.D.  put out its sophomore effort (Pharrell and Chad’s faux-rock sideshow), but after that there hasn’t been one mentionable Neptunes production to hit radio (despite their worthy two-song stint on  Cee-Lo’s  early 2004 release,  Cee-Lo Green…is the Soul Machine ). One might blame this on pure exhaustion from ’03, but for such a young duo, the disappearance is nothing if not disappointing. The two would need some huge radio success or another parented album (like  Justin Timberlake’s   Justified ) to even be in contention for  Producers of the Year , but their lackluster pace seems to put them out of the race (even with a second  Clipse  release slated for later this year).   History  Mentionable Tracks Timeline (Followed by  Billboard charting )  Probably the most sought out producers in the game, the Neptunes have made inventive track after track throughout their careers, with the occasional and understandable miss.  1999:   Got My Money - Ol’ Dirty Bastard feat. Kelis   (#26)   2000:   Shake Ya Ass - Mystikal   (#13)   2001:   I Just Wanna Love U (Give it 2 Me) - Jay-Z   (#11)   I’m a Slave 4 U - Britney Spears   (#27)   Girlfriend  -‘N Sync   (#5)   Diddy - P. Diddy   (#66)   Bouncin’ Back (Bumpin’ Me Against the Wall) - Mystikal   (#37)   2002:   Hot in Herre - Nelly   (#1)   2003:   Like I Love You - Justin Timberlake   (#11)   Señorita - Justin Timberlake   (#27)   Rock Your Body - Justin Timberlake   (#5)   Luv U Better - LL Cool J   (#4)   Beautiful - Snoop Dogg   (#6)   Excuse Me Miss - Jay-Z   (#8)   Frontin’ - Pharrell feat. Jay-Z   (#5)    Career Botches   Change Clothes - Jay-Z   (#10)  Returning the favor for Jay-Z’s guest spot on Pharrell’s 2003 summer jam, “Frontin’”, the Neptunes produced the headlining single for Jay’s victory lap final album,  The Black Album . But even after giving Jay perhaps his funkiest single ever (2001’s “I Just Wanna Love U”), Chad and Pharrell fell very short of the bar on “Change Clothes,” writing a near-anthem for semi-nude teaser clubs. The only thing the track had going was danceable spoon percussion, but that seemed forgettable when mixed in with the rest of the syrupy production, which included an outdated synth line and some lacking piano. Trying to craft the ultimate one-night stand song (“Change clothes, and go”), the Neptunes ended up writing a sex-crazed track on the verge of perversion.  Grindin’ - Clipse   (#30)  Clipse was and still is the Neptune’s son/daughter project, taking almost full production from Chad and Pharrell on their albums and hoping for the best. “Grindin’” was the first single that the group put out, a minimalist, rap-focused jam begging to be an urban-only phenomenon. With the bleacher-shaking percussion used again in J-Kwon’s “Tipsy,” the Neptunes let Clipse do the talking, only supplying a whispered chorus (courtesy of Pharrell) amidst some heavy street lyricism. The track flopped on the charts, though, mainly because it tried too hard as verbal anthem while trying too little as an audible anthem. The Neptunes took a back-to-basics approach, and, predictably, came out overly basic.   Career Highlights   U Don’t Have to Call - Usher   (#3)  The Neptunes hit the crossover jackpot in 2001 when Usher won a Grammy with “U Don’t Have to Call,” a brilliant update on Michael Jackson’s  Thriller -era club hits. Using some tubular techno falls in between glossy keyboard chords, the Neptunes finally gave us a taste of their ultramodern jamming, no artist to better karaoke to it than Usher. This track may have seemed like it was back-to-basics, pulling a Jackson-esque front, but it was undeniably back to the future.  Milkshake - Kelis   (#3)  Ditching any sort of boundaries, the Neptunes digitized the pop charts in late 2003 with “Milkshake,” a track that essentially became the ultimate innuendo (“My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard”). Hot electro-funk played underneath a hotter Kelis, managing to take extreme static and make it sizzle, all the while flirting with subtly orgasmic “you’re order is ready” bell dings. What made “Milkshake” one of the defining tracks of 2003 and one of the sexiest tracks post-2000, though, was that everyone who heard it wanted their order to be ready.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   She Wants to Move - N.E.R.D.  The headlining single to N.E.R.D.’s second release,  Fly or Die , “She Wants to Move” is a track rooted in bipolarity, for while its hard not to bob to it, the song is much too simple for a Neptunes production. Able only to cook up a recycled, half-step pump up rhythm, Chad and Pharrell reason through steamy Spanish guitar, salsa-worthy pianism, and a wailing (but extremely simple) guitar riff. Next to their other hits (I’m thinking of Britney’s “I’m a Slave 4 U”), this track is a laughable attempt at sexiness, almost asking to be slowed down into sensual balladry. This track is the evidence that the Neptunes are fire in the pop and rap spectrums, but merely warmth when trying to rock out.   Flap Your Wings - Nelly   While 2002's "Hot in Herre" was a number one hit and will be a club staple for years to come, this attempt at a rewrite is nothing more than party rap as dated as, well, Nelly's catch phrase ("Drop down and get your eagle on"). On top of that, the music behind Nelly's never-failing ego is extremely weak for a  Neptunes  production, merely some jingle-jangle percussion and continuously climbing organ notes. A complete misstep on radio stations all over America, the world's favorite pop rapper and the world's favorite pop producers were unable to churn out another danceable hit. Instead, they released a persistent, perverted, and lazy sequel to "Hot in Herre" that may actually inspire birds not to migrate.
