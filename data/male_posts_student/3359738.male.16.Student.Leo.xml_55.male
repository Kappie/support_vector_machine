They're allowing medicinal-type gum. -- (anyway, what's up with the picture on the article page? It's beyond me how a man with what looks like a bone, picking his filthy yellow teeth with it, have to do with chewing gum. In fact, from the picture, all I can gather is that Singaporeans need some serious dental care.)  And if a ban on chewing gum wasn't enough, it is in fact, also illegal. I quote:   "Anyone found dealing gum illegally will face up to two years in jail."   (Jesus christ, these must be truly dangerous individuals!)  I can already picture the setting... a man laid on the wall looks suspiciously at an individual and says " Want bubbles? ", then they go to a dark alley and deal bubblegum, and the dealer gets like 50 bucks off the sale. (well, in the Singaporean equivalent.)  Imagine an employer doing a background search on you and finding that you have a criminal record, with just one entry saying " Guilty of dealing bubblegum in Singapore ". haha!  And that's not all. IF you do want to chew gum, you need to get a  urlLink license .    Coming soon to your nearest cinemas... the new Bond movie... "Mission in Singapore: License to Chew"
