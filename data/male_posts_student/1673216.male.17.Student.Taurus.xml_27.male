A teardrop falls,      The emotion calls, Towards the end, which path to choose?  Holding on tight, dazed and broken, no path is clear, there is no order.      A lightbulb flickers,      My brain, it bickers To descruction! It's not a matter of choice.  A shadow of silence drapes over.   Why is it calmest,   Just after the storm? Everything is dull when it's gone.  -Unknown.  Fits the mood!
