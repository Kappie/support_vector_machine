I am happy, but a bit disapointed to say...the electricity is BACK on!!!! (Course many of you prob. know that already) Let's see...on Thursday between 2 and the time the power went off, I had this reallly strange feeling...I think it was linked to the power outage. But I found out about the power outage as I was reading...and suddenly my laptop went, "ding ding" to show that it switched to battery. I also noticed it say, "Local Connection Terminated" ME: o.o'     So, I tried the TV and no success, I phoned Umi-sama and I figured out that hers was gone too....but, I'd soon know that many,  many  others were without also....*nodz nodz*But, I must say, the last 2 days have been exciting...it was...something different. And the stars were so clear, it was amazing....The power went back on at around 10....but imagine the suprise i had when I woke up to the harshest thunder storm i had seen in many years! The thunder was SO LOUD!  *sigh* Well, the electricity managed to stay. I bet many were like, "THANK GOD!" Hm. Does anyone know the cause of the blackout? Cause I've heard different stories.....    On a spiritual/supernatural/supicious level, I have come to a conclusion that was based off ideas that Jade-chan suggested...."A warning," she said, "this could just be a warning, it may not even be the "big thing"" (btw, this is not  exactly  what she said) I began to wonder...was that why our premotnitions came so sutle? My warning came only 2 hours before, Jade's was just a vision within a dream, about her frige having lots of food in it. (Turned out her mom bought los of food when the blackout came about) Then, just this morning, things started to piece together.    Q: Who would send the warning?       Well, last night I had a dream that I was drinking milk...well, trying to, cause suddenly this bee and two different types of flies started coming at it. I put the glass of milk down and decided I'd have to get the fly swater, dispite my wishes not to kill. So i held it in hand, but suddenly I noticed that even land insects started coming for it, all these aunts and such. *But amoung them, standing very still where they were all movinig....was a spider. My vision lingered there, I lifted a brow, there was something strange about a spider being with that bunch....* But I didn't have time to think and a bee came at me, I tried to swat at it, but my hits were weak and i fell to the ground as it started stinging me. I woke to the sound of this morning's thunder storm...a very loud one. So....we have here the clues: blackout; dream (spider); thunder storm.....It can only mean one thing: Thunder Emporer....(aka Thunder Ruler or Charles) I tried contacting him, and others, he told me that there was a danger to look out for....*looks around* we can only se....     ne wayz, nuff of my crazy ramblings, ^_^ i hope everyone found this experiance as exciting as i did...oooo the stars were bright....ne wayz, ja!    HoSHi*~
