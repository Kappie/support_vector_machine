I love my online family, hehe, I don't think I say that enough. J'amour ma famille. (Mike, Brian, Richard, Eugenia, Bill, Joey, Corey, CF, Pooch, and anyone else I forget, you're included too.) On Monday night (Tuesday morning), Bill was nice enough to keep me company. As he said, we talked up a storm. We took up the entirety of Mike's message board, hehe. I think we talked for three or four hours. Bill is Mike's friend if you all are wondering. We talked about mi vida (my life) because as always it sucks. Then we talked about Yugoslavia and stuff and then we got to talking about food which made me hungry at 11:00 at night. How did we get to that again? Oh yeah, a pop-up for a free lobster dinner at Red Lobster came up and I guess that's where it started. It was nice getting to know Bill better. Friends are always good to have, the more the merrier.     Let's see home life wasn't as great. I hate getting yelled at, especially for something really stupid ir for absolutely no reason. If I get yelled at for those two reasons, I will start to cry and go up to my room and just stay there and never come out. That's just me. Then I'll be cussing them out in my head. That would be how I would calm down. Because that gets me real angry for somethin so stupid. If you're gonna yell at me, make sure it's for a good reason and not for somethin stupid, because I really hate that. And you wanna know what I got yelled at for? It was for using a meat cleaver (those real big knives) to cut a roast in half instead of using a regular chopping knife. That was so stuoid and uncalled for. But whatever. I don't give a damn for that stuff.
