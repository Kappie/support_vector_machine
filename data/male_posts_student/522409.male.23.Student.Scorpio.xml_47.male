Villepin is doing more than harmless elbow-rubbing with his "counterpart" in Libya, again blurring the lines as to who he hopes will prove victorious in the Iraq War.  It's so hard to even picture it in this day and age, but continued conduct in this direction could eventually position France and the US as enemies.  Enemies?!?!  France and the US?  Can you imagine us going to war with France?  It makes me ill to have to think like that, but what the hell--it's their funeral.  For countries like France or Germany who have seen and been overcome by true evil at points in their recent history, to only a generation later be completely unable and unwilling to identify evil... a fool's error, to be sure.  They'll pay a severe price in the long run.  Frankly, I hope they choke.  I'm surprised at Germany... but deeply saddened by France.  They're just plain moronic.
