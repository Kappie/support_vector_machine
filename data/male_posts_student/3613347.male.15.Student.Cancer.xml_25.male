Chun Rui was damn zai with his arctic! I was 3rd or 4th amongst all of us. Still not good enough... lost to E FACE.   Warcraft was the best. I found out that there were different missions, such as defending... which i have never played b4. I loved the Wintermaul! although i was the one who caused our team to lose.. Now i mastered the key to playing it... when will we go and play again?
