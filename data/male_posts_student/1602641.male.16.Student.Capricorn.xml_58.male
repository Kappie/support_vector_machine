The room - filled with College Republicans - laughed. It was indicative of how the Republican Party has been getting plenty of mileage out of Senator Kerry's French connections. They love to attack him because he went to boarding school in Europe and is fluent in French. Commerce Secretary Don Evans said "He looks French". He gets criticized for having family in France.  AS THOUGH ALL OF THESE ARE ACTUALLY BAD THINGS.  Look, I have my own problems with the French. I find them overly whiney, emotional, and self-absorbed. But they, like most of Europe, are way, WAY ahead of us when it comes to issues of social progress and international relations. Heaven forbid we should get a president who creates policy based on some kind of global perspective as opposed to the schmuck who we currently have in office, who apparently is unaware that there's a world outside of Crawford, Texas. We should stop distancing ourselves from the French and realize that we can learn a lot from them.   And another thing - just because our position as a global hegemon is being challenged by a united Europe, that doesn't mean we should fear it. After all, the last time the world was split between two major powers (the Cold War), there were no large-scale international conflicts for over fifty years. Plus, there's not a massive ideological gap between the two powers this time. So lets just stop trying to divide Europe and embrace it a little more.
