I don't want to get into all the reasons why I like Bush, but I'm a firm supporter.  What's sad is people aren't "voting for Kerry," they're voting "against Bush."  And for those who think Kerry is a good candidate, check this out, he's done more flipping and flopping than a fish out of water...than a short order cook at 7 a.m...okay that's enough... Austin .   urlLink Kerry's Record   You know something else that makes me mad, I won't turn 18 until a few days after the election in November. Ahh!  I can't even vote for Bush!!  In the words of Newman: Oh the Humanity!
