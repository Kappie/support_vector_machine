A portable polygraph would work equally as well.  I mean, it is a person's given right to lie, but I really wish everyone was just truthful.  Truth hurts.  Oh well, you'll get over it.  The world (at least my limited one) would be so much more extremely better if everyone would stop acting and start getting real! (Sorry, stole it from the Real World)  I guess I can't change the world or save it from self-destruction.  But I pray to God that I could.  I hope that one day, everyone will wake up and realize that life isn't just about the next dance or whose party everyone is going to.  Yeah, that's important, but...::sigh::...I can't come up with the right words. Nevermind.  Gnite.
