If you are interested in purchasing my iMac from me or swapping it for a 2nd or 3rd generation iPod, please email me  urlLink here  or if you are using Hotmail/Gmail/Yahoo, send one to sockeatingdryer[at]gmail[dot]com. Thanks so much! I also would like to say Happy Birthday to one of my favourite sirens, Kylie Minogue! I want to just snog with you!
