Lots of Queers listening to good punk and rock and drinking. Hooray. R. and i will get to hang out with everyone, and they can see us together and be disguted at the sweetness. So fun. Was supposed to do research today, but both of my papers are now delayed(legitimately), so i hung out at my coffee shop, played solitaire, went to the thrift shop and bought some stuff--a fly coat, a hat and the hotest wool pants, they are almost indecent in how they cling. Yay. Have been e-mailing a lot with my sister D. and we are developing a nice relationship which i am happy for. She is really cool , and really supportive of my life. It is really nice. Strange tho, i was always raised as an only child, and now i really do feel that i have a sibling. Well, anything else i write will be too incoherent to read due to my sleepiness, so Happy Thanksgiving everyone cheers d
