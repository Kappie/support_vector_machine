I'd love to get a quote or riddle or just some brief thought in the middle of the day. Short messages only, as I only get the first 130 or so letters, spaces, and puntuation. And best of all, it's free, so flood me as much as you want!! Or not. You know, i realize it does require work...so you won't disapoint me. By the way, that's my cell number....341-0958
