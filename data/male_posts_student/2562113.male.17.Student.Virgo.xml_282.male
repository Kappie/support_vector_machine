I'm proud of you all for making it out of NRHS successfully and moving on to college. Lots of smutters will be making their freshman debut at UAlbany next semester; good times lie ahead for all of you.  I ran over a can of paint with the forklift at work today. Whoops. Big mess. Give me another week and I will have mastered the forklift!  I was going to say something else but it slipped my mind. Damn sleep deprivation.  Peace!  -BIGsmut
