According to raw science, when it comes right down to the facts, we eat and drink like animals, sleep like animals, we reproduce like animals, we can kill our own species like animals, and we can be trained like animals. Without education, there would be difference between the behavior of humans and animals.  However I have encountered many people who say that since humans are spiritual beings, we are not animals.  I have to agree partially with that. We are intelligent, sentient, spiritual beings. But we are not completely separate from monkeys. Studies show that human DNA is almost identical to a monkey's, allowing blood transplants from our primate cousins.  So does this prove the theory of evolution?  The theory of evolution I hope you all know. The belief of creation I hope you all know. I will discuss this in my next blog.
