Her name is Becky and she's 14 and so fustrating sometimes!        Most of the time she is on the phone to random people, for hours on end, blocking up the phone line. I mean, I don't mind a couple of hours spent chatting to a good mate,like I ring John or even my mate Nicci... but Becky, oh god no... she's different. She can spend 3 hours on the phone to people she probably doesn't know too well and from the sounds of it she never has anything decent to talk about. Maybe the odd slagging session (she can be quite bitchy!) or the silent conversation with the odd "Sooooo, what do you wanna talk about?", which may I add is usually in this stupid accent which really winds me up (but I won't get into that today.. that's a post in itself!). I feel like saying If you haven't got anything to talk about get off the phone and let others use it! People might be trying to get in touch, and there's 3 other people in the house to consider... does she everthink thatwe might want to ring somebody too?        The amount of times I've walked into the kitchen during the day to get a drink and she'll be sat there with the phone on speakerphone balanced on the table, eating her lunch, not a word being spoken. I feel sorry for the poor sod on the other end having to listen to her muching away! Wouldn't you at least say like, "I'm having my lunch now, I'll ring you back" or something! Arrrrggghhh!        Oh and her bloody sleepovers. During the weekends and most days during any school holidays she'll have people sleeping over. Anything from 1 girl to 12. And I hate it. To be honest her mates (and herself especially it seems) are quite immature for their age. They run around like loose dogs yapping and screaming! They have theTV on too loud, so when the rest of the family are tucked up in bed, it takes longer to get some shuteye as all you can hear or think about is those lot messing about downstairs or laughing wayyyy too loud in her room!I'm not beingpicky, I'm sure you'dsay the same if you had to live with her!        And to make matters worse... sleepovers and stupid phonecalls put together! Her mates and herselfusually pile around the kitchen table with the phone on speakerphone (oh yes... yet again!) for about 2 hours, talking crap and usually not speaking at all! And the REALLY annoying thing, is that when you walk into the kitchen when they are all sat there around the table on the phone, they say "Say hello to whatsaface!" and I'm like, "How about no?!"        LIVING PROOF! (Guess what, at the moment it's 23:15 and the phones just rang... parents are in bed as they both work and have early mornings (especially my dad at 5:30) and I just answered the phone and this rude little shit is on the other end, "Becca there?". Canthey not string a sentence together properly? Most of them are scallies (ask John and he'll back me up on this. Oh goody that's another post on the people she hangs outwith! The lot that have hidden in my house and my mates had to chase them away at night, when my rents were out!)And they shouldn't ring so late anyway! At least give them warning so they can pick up the phone straight away so as to not wake my rents up!)        Jeese, I don't know anybody else thatcould wind me up anymore than she can! And to make matters worse I have to deal with complaints off John and even my nan! My nan lives about 3 hours away and our family don't get to see her too often. Me and John went down the stay there for a week and I felt pretty wrecked when she went on about how our line is always engaged. I had to explain about Becky and she wasn't impressed with her.. she seemed pretty upset as she mentioned that she's never able to chat with my mum anymore as she can't get in touch.       Nuff Said Biatch
