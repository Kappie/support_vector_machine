Tyke had to get up very early for a Saturday for Tyke.  He woke up at about 8:30 and got ready in his suit which he really likes to wear but hardly ever actually gets to.  But he wore it and he looked studly (his relatives even said that he looked studly just in different words).  The graveside services were at Sunset Memorial Park in Bellevue.  That might not be the actual title of the place but oh well.  And Tyke just pulled out a long hair from his mouth.  Not sure how it got there but maybe it's Tina's from tonight.  Anyway, oh wait broom time.  Broom stands for bathroom for those who don't know.  Back again.  Back to the subject du jour, Tyke was at the funeral and the sun was blazing down even though it was only 10 AM and not super hot.  But with Tyke's black suit he really started to feel the heat as he was just standing around on uneven ground for quite some time.  Everyone gathered around the closed casket and some people sat in the chairs in front.  The chaplain (same as for Josh Williams) came over and talked and a few songs were played and then Tyke's dad spoke and then the chaplain told another story.  Then one last song was listened to before a basket of roses was brought out for family and friends to take and place on the casket.  There was a lot of crying this time but it was good to get closure for everyone.  Tyke found himself at the end almost coming to tears but for some reason he wouldn't.  He doesn't really know why but he just didn't.  Tyke helped his dad's cousin (what does that make him in relation to Tyke?) get over to Tyke's uncle's house in South Cove.  As Tyke was driving there he saw Purdy driving away but she didn't see him.  Tyke quickly changed out of his suit and then went inside to help with everything.  It was nice to chat with some people that he has never seen before.  Now that Tyke is a little older it is not hard to start up a little conversation with someone.  He always gets asked about graduation and college and those kinds of subjects as well as his trip to Europe coming up.  So there is plenty to talk about.  Tyke ate quite a bit of food and had a bunch of carrots while he was there.  As just about everyone had left Tyke and his brother said their final goodbyes and then they went back home.  Tyke changed and ate some more before Kinker came over.  They went up to Kramm's to play bball Issaquah v. Skyline.  Issaquah up 2-0 at this point.  Tyke, Kinker, and HoChyt were the starting lineup for Issy.  Ekul, Kramm, and C-Biscuit (sorta random name but Tyke does have a reason for making it up) were the Skyline players.  Once again the Issys came out on top but Kramm ended up twisting his ankle again and that thing swelled up big time.  He saw it at Purdy's at night and it was quite big.  None of the 6 players played very well at all.  Not sure why.  Tyke did play pretty well though.  Well enough to keep his team in the game.  The fadeaway is definitely Tyke's shot.  They hung out there for a while before coming back to Tyke's.  Tyke showered and changed and cologned and then headed off to Purdy's for Tina's surprise 18th birthday party.  The pair of Tyke and Ekul hung out for much of the night keeping their solidarity together.  Ever since TOLO they have had a special little thing going that they keep tradition.  And tonight was definitely a night where they could do that.  There were a few Issaquah guys and some Issaquah girls like Frederique there.  Kram was there of course.  Tyke played LIFE with the ladies and won with $1.7 million.  He was quite good at that even though he divorced his wife and never had kids because he got shot in the groin while on duty as a police officer.  Tough life but he made it out alright.  For some of the night it was kind of grouped up with the Issaquah guys (not including Tyke) together and the Skyline guys together with the girls all being together sorta too but Tyke tried to find a little way into one of the groups.  It's not like he was excluded or anything.  Tyke and Ekul hung out more later on and then they had a nice little game with the crane (that is the bug that Tyke was trying to think of last night) and other stuff as well.  Then they went to the bonfire area by Tina's house and had a bonfire.  Tyke and Ekul saw some muskrats swimming around in the water but they decided that it was actually Loch Ness monster because she has two heads so that definitely made it her.  Tyke only got burned a few times by the fire this night out.  Tyke talked with Tina some and Frederique some but mainly sat around in the blaze lighting his coat hanger on fire.  It really wasn't Tyke at his best tonight.  He didn't give it his all because he had that feeling come back to him once again.  Like it has so many nights he just kinda got pulled back into his shell that he is hardly ever in and he just sat around.  Tina pulled him over to her and they stood and chatted like they always do now but Tyke still felt the same.  Which is too bad.  He doesn't try to show it that much because it isn't like someone should have to try and make him feel better, especially Tina because it is her night anyway.   Tyke just needs to deal with it and move on.  He can't change anything nor can anyone else.  But that still doesn't mean Tyke can enjoy everything.  There were some really fun moments at the bonfire but Tyke just wanted something different.  He really wants to settle down it seems like.  Although Tyke hasn't had a real girlfriend before he still wants to just settle down now.  Tyke would not be opposed to only having one girlfriend in life as long as they married and stayed together.  Tyke doesn't need to go searching everywhere to find her.  He just wants it to be there and free.  There is one girl that Tyke wishes more than anyone in the world didn't have a boyfriend and you probably know that.  But it isn't like that will change, it is late in senior year anyway, and even if she didn't have a boyfriend it wouldn't change her feelings about Tyke.  It's always the negative that Tyke focuses on in these moods.  Also it is the hopeful possibilities that Tyke focuses on.  More those than simply the negative.  The worst part about this is the feeling sorry for himself.  Cuz that is just a downward spiral.  Having all of these great girl friends should be nice but it is a painful dagger at the same time.  It's hard to swallow the fact that Tyke is around such beautiful girls almost everyday but they have never seen him the same way he sees them.  The best friends of Tyke's are often girls but Tyke almost always wants it to be more than that.  Although he regrets it, he would most likely trade all of these girls for the one girl that actually geniunely feels for him like he does for her.  It isn't something Tyke wants to have happen but Tyke just wants to be happy and he isn't.  Girls make him happy.  Very happy.  And sad.  Very sad.  It's really not that complicated.  Tyke wants a girlfriend but doesn't have one.  Tyke has liked lots of girls.  Most of those girls have had boyfriends.  And some of them have had ones that Tyke really doesn't think that highly of.  It's a terrible thought when Tyke thinks that he is a better person than a boyfriend.  That often causes Tyke pain.  Cuz then it's like nothing is on Tyke's side.  Then Tyke thinks that he just isn't anyone's "type" but how can that be true?  Can everyone have a type?  Tyke probably has a type.  Well, he does.  The wrong girls must be Tyke's type.  Heh heh.  Blech.  Maybe Tyke needs to start looking for something different.  Like guys.  Haha, just kidding.  See how bad this has gotten?  Tyke has gotten to the point where he had to joke about being gay.  Not that there's anything wrong with that (name the show).  Nothing more seems to be coming to Tyke's mind now.  Such an early night.  Such a wishful night.  Such a lonely boy.
