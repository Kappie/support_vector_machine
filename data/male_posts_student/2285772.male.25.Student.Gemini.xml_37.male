"...the book of mormon is the most complex, ambitious, and influential pseudotranslation that the world has ever seen or is, indeed, ever likely to see." and he finishes the article with "...joseph smith was not content to lightly rework and paraphrase existing scripture. instead, armed with the courage of his considerable convictions, joseph smith set out ot fashion his own scripture, creating for himself in the book of mormon a monument to his work as paraphraser and prophet."  i want to jump on to another book...either  urlLink farm 's  urlLink  the temple in time and eternity   or another book which i have not yet decided. first i gotta finish the book of mormon. i'm in the end of 3rd nephi and wanted to finish the book by new years so that i can start afresh with the new year to follow the gospel doctrine class's lessons.
