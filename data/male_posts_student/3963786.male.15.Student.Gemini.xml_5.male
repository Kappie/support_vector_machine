I got over there and we didn't do much, I just hooked up the sex box and we played for a while. SEX BOX= X BOX. Afterwards instead of having to cram on a phooton, footon, futon, phouton....w/e.....trav said we are crashing outside in a tent he and brandon and ryan had set up and used for the past 2 days. So travis and his bro fell asleep like bricks, and I, as usualy, haven't been able to sleep as easy the past few days. So I got to sit up on the hard ground and think to myself, and think to myself, and think to myself. Eventually Trav woke up and saw me sittin there and thought it was the music being too loud..I played along. But right before I went to sleep I finally got hit with the fact that Nikki is probably never going to talk to me ever again, and if she does, it's not going to be on good terms. I really wish I could have talked to Cory through all this, it would have made things 2 million times easier. She would have said something that made me feel better and made me seem like I wasn't the one who screwed up completely. Well I guess it's back to being solo, lotsa fun there. This is my good-bye to Nikki, since I don't know if she's ever going to talk to me again........  Goodbye Nikki, We could have been good, We could have been great, Out of all these things we could have been, I turned it all to hate.
