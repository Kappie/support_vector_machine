Anyway I've really got to get practicing for my piano recital because I don't have my piece memorized, and I can hardly get through it. But it's so hard to practice because my piano is out of tune. I think I might throw up.  But it's ok. Because I get out of school on the 18! School really gets out on the 21st but I don't have to take finals so I get the last three days off! OH YEAH!  I'm feeling kinda down lately. I just don't feel very good. Everything at school is kind of falling apart, and I don't want it too. It was perfect (yeah right) ok it was going ok until about a week ago. I don't know what happened but it's like the whole place is just going balistic. I think it's because we're all on the verge of getting out but we're still in. :) does that make any sense?  Anyway I might have a job this summer! OK now don't laugh, but me, Andrew Sapp, and Jesseka are going to build web pages for people! Of course all the money goes to the music fund at church. But we get a little bit! OH YEAH! I don't know how long that will last though, cause even though i can write some HTML, I'm not the best person to be building professional sites. But hey I'll do my best.  Anyway I gotta go. The piano calls me.
