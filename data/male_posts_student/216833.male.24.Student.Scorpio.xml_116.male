The way I feel right now(really tired) is not gonna be any better after I get off work. I'm pretty sure this whole trip will be wrapped in a blanket of fatigue.  I picked up the truck yesterday with my good friend eric. He drove me out there and followed me back to my house. The thing is not nearly as massive as I first thought. It's brand new, 2002 model, and that comforts me. I have almost everything loaded except for my bed, computer, TV, and misc. stuff. I think their should be plenty of room in the truck for Leatha's stuff. I filled it up though. Alot more shit in there than I thought.   Right now I am talking to two condo landlords in Navato and Santa Rosa. The guy in Santa Rosa sounds like a good guy. He is going to call me around 12noon PST and let me know if we are in. It's smaller and lesser of everything, but I am willing to give up things just to have a little security. It's nice to have a place to live, mosdef.  I have soooo much to do today. It's mind-blowing.   current mood:  thirsty current music: jawbreaker - unfun
