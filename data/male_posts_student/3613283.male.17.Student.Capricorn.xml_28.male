"The sort of pressure used by the global warming activists is not the usual one of forcing corporate managements to cave in under the threat of bad publicity. Instead, the activists become shareholders of publicly owned companies, attempting to steer corporate policy under the guise of being corporate "owners."  During 2003, these activist shareholders filed resolutions with more than 25 companies, urging them to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. None of the resolutions came close to passing, but in some cases they received significant shareholder support: 32 percent at ChevronTexaco; 27 percent at American Electric Power, the largest coal-fired U.S. electricity generator; 23 percent at General Electric; 21 percent at ExxonMobil."    urlLink Washington Times: Revamped Green strategy
