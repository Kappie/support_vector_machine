I bought the new Zelda game for GameCube and I bought the OC Mix 1. Take that Josh. I already had it all on my computer, but the music is so freaking good! Huzzah! Yep, and that's what I did today. Rock on Chatham bus thing.  Every time I think about tomorrow my stomach just lurches. It turns over. Man I'm SO scared!! Eeeeeeeeeek. But.. I'll be fine. It's my first day; there will be room for leaniancy. I hope I don't get fired... Can they even do that? Fire you on your first day. Right that's the last of that... My stomach hurts.  In other news... Wait there is no other news. Catch you on the slip side.
