I can't stand the thought of not having him there to talk to, especially now since he means so much more to me than ever.    I logged online today and found an e-mail from him.  I love getting e-mails from him.  But unfortunately, this one wasn't filled with awesome metaphors and a good message.  This e-mail was filled with two zipped conversations.  From the very first to the most recent (and hopefully not the very last).  Which I guess was nice.  But I wanted a message from him.  Sigh.  12 MB.  Wow.  Since June 17th, 2003.  To July 10th, 2004.  A year.  And more.  I told Amanda about us today.  And that felt good.    Anyway, about the Simpsons.  Today, the episode was really touching and it made me tear up a little bit.  It was about when Homer was a young kid.  He was sent to camp where they made him work.  At camp, Homer met this girl and they shared their first kiss under the stars.  And after that, he didn't see her again.  She was heart broken.  And so was he.  Well, it turns out that the girl was Marge.  And so in the end, they did get back together again.  Without knowing their previous romance.  And I found that very touching.    Its something I would want someday with Matt.  But that road is filled with many many bad parts.  Pain.  And tears.  But in the end, is it worth it?  It is.    Other than that, I'm randomly tearing up whenever I think of Matt and how he's moving away.  Hopefully it'll get better.  Soon.  Also, I might be going away the two weeks he's home.  Which is bad since the last time I saw him (yesterday) we didn't get any alone time.  Which I need before he leaves.  To have him hold me one last time.  Lets hope this all works out.  Hope.  Sigh.
