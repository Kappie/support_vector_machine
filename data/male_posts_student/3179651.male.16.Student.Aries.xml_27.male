Now I'm on top, going harder, I want to touch every inch. I'm out of breath, my hair is disheveled, but yet I keep going. And then I wax my car after washing it. Get your mind out of the gutter.  Good thing she told me she was gonna wash the car before hand, or I woulda had some really dirty thoughts...  Speaking of dirty, this guy who got my sn from someone else keeps hitting on me, and I know he's not my type. Bean, I think I'm gonna need your help getting this bugger away... :(
