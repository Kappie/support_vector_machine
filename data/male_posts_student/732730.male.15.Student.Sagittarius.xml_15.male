Tanya 'n' Tara and Co. resent that since Karmann came back to Peace, Ellie has ditched them. I spoke to Ellie about it, and she said that they ditched her too. I told Tanya, and she said "That's crap! We still  try  to talk to them, but as soon as Karmann comes, she leaves". Anyway, at recess today she spent some time with them, and Tanya said to me "At least she's trying". I guess it'll get better! [Edit: ^^^^ That was /very/ incoherent :$]  The past few day's I've been reading Lizzy's blog. It's about of the same standard as mine (HAHAHAHA), so  urlLink check it out  if you have nothing better to do.    urlLink Penis Owner's Manual , for those gyuys who don't know how to use one, and for the girls who want to know ;)  Um. I don't know what else to say... OH! Aphrodite got evicted from Big Brother *tear*. She rocked! YOU ROCK APH!
