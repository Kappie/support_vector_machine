I often worry about Belle's comfort.  Her bed is rather lumpy but new beds are really expensive, at least the kind that we want are.  However, with this new snow I am concerned about her going outside without a coat.  So, I got on the internet and found a great coat in her size and it is only $60.  The problem, my parents claim that she doesn't need a coat and they refuse to spend 60 bucks on her.  I think it is most unfair.  She doesn't like to go outside very far.  I also wanted to get her some snow boots or at least shoes to keep her feet dry, but again with the money issue.  She came in yesterday evening and slid across the tile because her feet were wet with the snow.  My parents felt bad so we might get the shoes now, I doubt it.  Next please...  Schools out.  Woohoo, right?  Well not exactly.  I really don't mind school and I really do mind the heat of June.  Oh well, I guess extended weekends are nice.  And last of all...  "Drive safely and arrive alive"  It's a wonderful radio commercial that I heard while driving through the snow last night.  I am not sure why but it just cracked me up.  I thought that they could have come up with something that sounded a little nicer.  Por ejemplo " Drive like a maniac and there is a pretty good chance that you are going to end up in a ditch somewhere bleeding out of your eyesockets"  By the way--for those of you who don't know, Belle is my dog--actually you could call her my bitch. HAHA!
