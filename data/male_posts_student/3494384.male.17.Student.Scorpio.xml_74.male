Anyway, I shall throw this computer away after my new computer arrive.  Was dead boring after my computer pang sei me. 9 plus. Message Wanxin and she happily watching movie. Cant go out with me. So I message Ivan. Hapily he say ok but then I know he's dead tired after watching the NDP and such. And he got to work at ten next day.  So meet up with him at 11.30 lorhz. Walked around and went eating McDonalds. How dare 12 plus Mc still open and happily allow us to buy food. Ivan even saw his grandma working happily inside.  How dare after that Wanxin called and happpily say my voice changed. What the hell. And happily walked past Mc with her friend dont know for what. Then she saw me eating happily lorhz. Dare she comment on me and my friend.  Went walking around after that and chat happily. How dare all around is less people. Then I doesnt want to stay in Tampines so I suggested that we anyhow take bus see where we can go since I dont intend to go home. Saw bus 3. Took it and thought we'll be going to Punggol but how dare it went to Pasir Ris only. Gou Lan.  Went to Downtown East. Sparks everywhere. :D  After that Ivan suggest me go his house stay overnight cuz I was like yawning the whole time. Speak alot to his mum before the mum allow me to stay over bahz. I'm so ma fan.
