He pulled off on the side of the road, jumped out of his car, walked down the hillside and picked a bunch of wildflowers, and proceeded to put one bouquet of the flowers in front of the car and one behind it. Then he got back in the car to wait A passerby studied the scene as he drove by and was so curious he turned around and went back. He asked the fellow what the problem was. The man replied,             "I have a flat tarr." In response the passerby asked,             "But what's with the flowers?" The man responded,             "When you break down they tell you to put flares in the front and flares in the back! I never did understand it neither."
