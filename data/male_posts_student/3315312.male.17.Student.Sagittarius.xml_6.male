We need a President who, in his own mind and in the minds of those under his care, will separate the truth from the lies. We need John Kerry.  With such grave danger in the world, does it really make sense to burn America’s vital bridges to her closest allies and alienate the global community- tarnishing America’s image for years to come? I don’t think so. Kerry doesn't either.  John Kerry has always been a strong leader. Whether it be bravely commanding a Swift Boat in Vietnam, putting some of the most dangerous criminals behind bars as a prosecutor, or fighting to protect the values his constituents and millions of Americans hold dear as a four-term Senator, Kerry has always been strong, brave, and wise.  John Kerry has and always will protect sacred civil rights and liberties. He has and always will bring both logic and justice to crime. Kerry has and always will fight for a healthy economy- one full of equal opportunity and abundant jobs. He believes in strengthening the family through looking at health care as a right rather than a privilege, as well as focusing on after-school programs and affordable higher learning.  Kerry will ensure that an illegitimate war will not be fought in America’s name. John Kerry will ensure that America’s image does not suffer at the hands of an arrogant bully. He recognizes the importance of shared responsibility and shared benefits. Kerry’s foreign policy and national security plans are right for America. As President, John Kerry will go beyond fighting for these things. He will provide them with flying colors.  I realize it may be discouraging to a teenager, especially one who can’t even vote yet, to jump into the realm of politics. Don’t be discouraged, be energized. Your country has no age restrictions on who can and can’t help her in a time of need. What is happening now matters. Our parents see the cause of the decisions made today, we see the effects tomorrow. If you are able to vote, don’t take it for granted. Exercise your right as an American citizen to voice your opinion. Even if you are not able to vote, you can still get involved and make a difference. Financially contribute to the individuals who best address your concerns. Volunteer for political organizations and campaigns. Engage in political discussions, letting others know how you stand and why you feel it is the right way to stand. Finally, if you haven’t gotten the message already, you should know that our country doesn’t need a misleader- it needs a leader. America needs to be strong at home and more respected in the world. America needs John Kerry in the White House.
