That depends on a few key factors, but basically you are living to stop someone else from living (because he raped your wife or something) or you are living to procreate; which means, if necessary, you should go rape someone's wife otherwise your life would be worthless. We are all rape babies of one form or another anyway. Rape-arpe-prae-pare-paer-pear. Forbidden fruit indeed. Civilized life is so full of paradoxes and subsequent double-standards.  Femminism is a funny thing, women scream their heads off saying we are suited to do what men do, we are no different then them.  It's so ridiculous, they are anatomically different, they are genetically different, not to mention the psychological imprints of playing "a womans role" for generations.  I'm not a sexist, i just dont get it i suppose.  maybe i am a sexist, maybe thats the defining characterestic of a sexist.  I know that my father would make a horrible mother, and my mother would make a horrible father,  I mean, they aren't even too good at their gender specific roles.  Anyway im getting out of here soon.  If bush is elected to another term ill be out of the country before he is out of office.  im afraid of being forced into hard labour.  if he doesn't get elected i'll probobly leave anyway, but not out of fear, just out of discontent.  - Rip  out   "Did it happen so fast, what you thought would always last has passed you by."
