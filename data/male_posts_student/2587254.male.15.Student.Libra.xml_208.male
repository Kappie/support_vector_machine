After comin' back home for a bit, I had to go back because I forgot something.  That took up most of the time until dinner, ate, and then here I am now blogging at 830pm. Yup....that pretty much sums up my day. I'm using my old glasses right now since my new pair is being fixed @ Lenscrafters at the moment.  Until tomorrow....  Later.
