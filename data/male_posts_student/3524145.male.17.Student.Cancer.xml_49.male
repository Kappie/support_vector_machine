It have been so long since the last time i send in my entry here... so long so long... have been quite lazy to type so much or even keep up with myself to type everyday... maybe dun have the time or even dun make the effort to do it... then since i am doing it today... then i will write a long long one.. since shijun is reading... lolZ.... haha...  Woahz... i just have so much so much so much things to say... so much... hrm.... have been thinking about my family these few days... so much things that i really longed for... thinking about lots of things in my life... so late le... now... one person sitting in the room... typing this blog... just kinda lonely... everyone is outside... mother just reach home... kinda worried bout her... so late then reach home... thinking about my mum just simply lead me to think about my earthly father... who is now in China... i dun even know which part of China he is in... but no matter what i just pray the Father in heaven will protect him and keep him safe... it have been just such a long time since i see him... the last time i see him was just a few days after i started school in Ngee Ann Poly... now... just hope to see him soon... really missed him so much... think about it... i am just so fortunate to have such great parents on the surface of this earth.... thank God...  Last few days i have been spending quite alot of time out with my friends... talking bout last friday... the feeling can never leave me...  i just feel so warm... when i enter the gates of BBSS ... that place really give me all kinds of memories... really so warm to be in there... so touched when the juniors still come over and talk to me... they are having their National Day celebrations... i just feel so good in that land... everything is still just so familiar... the warm from the people ... is much much better than the present one... so happy to see ex school mates going back too... seeing their faces just remind me of the days we had together... so much fun, happiness, sadness and bitterness... just went through everything together... some of them have changed... just have to admit that we are all just growing every single day... changing every second... things can never be as sweet and warm as the past... but the memories will always be there... really cherish the friendships...  On sunday night, after the leaders' training... went to meet yong liang, minting and lysia... then after that yi shi... the same old familiar faces... the group that always together... though diff class in the past but just so nice to be together... we met up to watch the fireworks thats going round around the esplanade... so cool... but i din get to watch coz i was late....  but its ok... after that we have lots of talks together... chit chat... lots of fun... though not much activities... but those things are real nice... but i am guilty for making my mum worried... Sorry mum...  Yesterday, A trauma?... i dunno... maybe i will nv know... but its ok... went out early in the morning for LMS project at wisma Mac... so stupid sia... but its nice lahz.. we almost finished the whole thing... spend all the brain cells thinking of those things... can't stand it... after that me and Deb went to meet Diana and Andrew... watched Village... many people may think its shit.. or anything else... but i just somehow think it have real deep meaning... and i see the hearts of those elders in the village... they just wish to have peace in the land... and have a crime free land... have a simple life... they are thinking of the whole village of people... they just have such parent heart... so nice... Later... we went marina bay for steamboat... enjoyed eatting with them... watching the fireworks from afar which is lighted at the national stadium for the national day parade... its so nice... very beautiful sky.... the rest... i guess to be keep unknown... That night... i bring my heart back to the Lord... i will bring myself back step by step... to another stage of breakthrough...
