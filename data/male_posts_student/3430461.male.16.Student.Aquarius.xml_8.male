I got rid of my old mail15 server site, cos you need to spam F5 to make the pictures show. Now I have a site at  urlLink 0catch , but the address is a bit naff so I'm going to buy a new one. It's still under construction btw.  Not much to say once again. My life's a bit boring really, what with all GCSEs and stuff. Sigh. All revision and likewise. Oh well. In three weeks time I have eight weeks drudgery. Everyones says "WOW! EIGHT WEEKS" and then it slowly starts to hit them that it's going to be the eight most boring weeks of their lives.  I promise once my GCSEs are over and intersting things start happening I will start bloging again.   Promise!
