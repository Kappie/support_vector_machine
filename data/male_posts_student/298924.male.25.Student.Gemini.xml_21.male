Okay....I feel regret about talking about dude's big head....that was foul of me....that will have to suffice for an apology since he doesn't know about this site, nor would he care other than the fact that I dogged him out....  Guess whose cable is still out?....Guess whose refrigerator has decided to go the way of the cable?....Guess who is about to shell out about $800 for a new one?....if you guessed Killa Cal for all three, I have a hero cookie for you....being a "grown folk" officially sucks now....  The Dolphins got shalacked but the Falcons won....I was only able to watch one of the games and it was the bad one....  Saturday night after I blogged I went to the class party....it was pretty off the chain....I had alot of fun....I was surprised by the "Bout-it-ness" of some of the girls in the class....one girl in particular had me reeling after I danced with her....I made a mental note to find her at every future class party for at least one dance....drinks were free and I have concluded that when I want to, I can remain sober and have fun....I was worried for a second to be honest....  Today seems like it is going to be a long day....again....I need something in my life....I can't figure out what it is....I'll know by the end of the day....  By the way....I am in the Newsweek "Best Colleges" issue....I don't know what page.....but it's an ad for Honda Motor Corporation.....I am answering a question at a quiz bowl tournament that my team (Morehouse College) won....I have my head turned talking to the captain....it's an interesting picture....my friend who is in the advertising business tells me that this is Newsweek's #1 selling issue....
