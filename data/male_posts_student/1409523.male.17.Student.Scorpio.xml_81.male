(when i get ancy i get depressed sometimes) and also because im not going to see cally for about four days... big disappointment.... but on the other hand look at the bright side... i have the whole summer to hang out with her... i might see if i can be some help with her studying for american history... then maybe we can get together tomorrow... anyways... i am grumpy too.. just because... well school pisses me off... school in general... but the competetiveness... and all the bullshit SATs and GPA and shit and shit... my life revolves around stupid numbers from 2 to 4 digits long... will it really matter when im 30 what my cumulative gpa was my fourth quarter junior year... or that i squeaked out a 1350 on the SAT... hell no.... so why oh why am i stressing so much about these stupid stupid things... another thing on my mind is the cally situation in general... i know that we are both overthinking things way too much... even though... at least to my knowledge we are both extremely happy with eachother (at least i can say that for sure on my part)... but i think in general we are both worried about getting too involved ... falling too fast... just to be let down... i know that after 17 years... of nonexistent relationships and bland prospects that cally is someone special... people like her don't come by everyday ... that is why i freak out a little bit when i think of the whole situation...when i get a chance like this... well... i just don't want to mess up the great thing we have... so yeah... anyways... i do feel like this.. but deep down... i know.. everything is going to be fine... and everything will work out... if you are reading this cally... just please don't worry... we can take it slow or whatever... but you don't need to worry...thats the last thing i want you to do.. just trust yourself and trust me.. everything is going to be AMAZING... ok... i really must study a little now.... to everyone else... don't stress over finals... its not worth it... no worries!...  -Nate
