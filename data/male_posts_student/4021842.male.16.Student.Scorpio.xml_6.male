I'm really not sure what to do with myself anymore, have i really given up?...i'm a lost forgotten soul that's searching for it's place in this giant world. Perhaps given time he'll find his place among the stars, and be someone...not sure where i should go with this, but meh, after highschool it's bye bye to everyone i once knew, everyone i once cared about, i'm not sure i'm ready to do that i'm not sure what i should do, anyways back to my happy place...where maybe i can relax a little and live a little more.
