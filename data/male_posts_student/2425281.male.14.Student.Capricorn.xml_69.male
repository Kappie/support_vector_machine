I'm using e-messenger because the library computers are so restricted it won't even let me check my e-mail. So why am i sitting in Gordon Library at 3 'o' clock in the afternoon? Well today i spent the whole day at Macquarie University for Japanese continuers day. It was pretty interesting, worth missing school over. Anyway it ended at 2 and i got a lift with Ken to Gordon station, where i'm waiting for my environmental science book to return to me. I could be home, but i'm here instead. Walking into the library at 2:30 was a bit strange. All the librarians and people were giving me weird looks that said "why the hell are you here, shouldn't you be at school?". Libraries are so empty during the day. Funny moment: when David Kim got the phone number of a Hornsby Girl he thought he knew from somewhere.
