When my world was upside down I didn't think that I could make it,  I reached out my hand for you and you were there to take it.  I wanna thank you for being my strength when I thought I couldn't go on.  And I wanna thank you for showing me right when my heart was leading me wrong  for all the times I was lost and my soul was blind.  I didn't know what to do.  Somehow you pulled me through -  and I wanna thank you.  When I was down and feelin' low, looked up and you were there - somehow you knew and found me.  You were the answer to my prayers.  You shined a light when it was dark.  And opened up my eyes.  You led the way when I was lost and you helped me realize.  I will never walk alone, cause you'll be by my side.  I don't know what I'd ever do without you in my life.  With every step I take you show me there's a way and in your hands, my heart  will never go astray. So each and every day I wanna thank you    Happy Birthday Mummy!! ^^  *yawns* really tired..been up since 5:30...making mums brekkie...heheh..really simple stuff...toast..jam...cuppa tea...didnt really wanna wake anyone up =/ more tears from both of us again =*) really shoulda got her something..but i think its the first time in a long long time since ive made her brekkie...and dad was in one of his moods =/  caught by sezza in hurrsie again..and stayed with her till 4:30 cos im 'sO nice' > she shoulda been at work experience as well!! wonder how she got the day off =/ gawd...mlc chicks...so very complicated...yet bimboish > well..at least ruthie has fallen for jason...so the whole playing n dump thingie is all gone and outta the way =D hmmm...im the 'vice president' of the « §4šŠ ¢¦µß™ » (Singles 4 SexC Simon Club)...im clueless...makes no sense to me..mlc peepz gotta brush up on their grammar O.o >  and...sandii is like 'no wonder he was confused before"...and shes feeling crap that she mightve broken his relationship..me and my big mouth > and..not to mention the fact that amy likes paul as well =/  sore throats gotten worse O.o starting to cough...and my throats still burning > off to sleep..niteZ!!
