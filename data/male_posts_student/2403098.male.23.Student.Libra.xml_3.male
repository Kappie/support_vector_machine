I want to live my life in the magical world of an Outkast video.  It would be like the Emerald City from the Wizard of Oz, except with better music.  Anyway, today I went with my parents in one of the boats to Port Aransas, about a thirty minute boat trip across the bay, for lunch.  It was fun, just to get out there and go fast, see porpoise swimming, watch the pelicans diving for fish, etc.  A bit chilly out there, but it was really fun.  Here we go:  Shake it, shake-shake-it, shake it, shake-shake-it, shake it, shake-shake-it, shake it like a Polaroid picture.  I wonder what song I'm listening to.  Now I'm just kind of relaxing around the house.  Still ready to do the whole application thing this afternoon.  I bought a new hat, that was exciting.  It smells like smoke.  Leave it to a small town to have stores where you can purchase new merchandise, that smells like old smoke.  It will be going in the dishwasher this afternoon.    What do you think about plastic surgery, mister Blog?  I wish you could respond, like an 8-ball or something.  Hmmm.   My cousin told me a hilarious story Christmas Eve. about her boyfriend getting her a birthday present.  I don't know what made me just remember this, but it was great.  He went out and bought her a Nintendo NES gaming system (you know the ORIGINAL Nintendo from like.. I don't know, '87 or something), complete with games and all.  When she was first telling me this, my first thought was "AWESOME!!" then I was like "wait, for your GIRLFRIEND'S birthday?!"  I guess, granted it's vintage, it's not exactly what a 22 year old female would want as a romantic gift from her boyfriend.  Oh lord I laughed at that one.  She was highly amused as well.  Hmm, what am I going to do tonight?  My brother has departed the compound to go kill things on some friends' ranch somewhere.  My parents and I will eat dinner together and then I'm sure they will turn in at around 11, and I'll be wired until 3 or 4am as usual.  I might take myself to a local bar and just have a drink and watch the locals.  I love the bars down here, they get you f*ed up super fast with their strong drinks, and the people are fun.  When we were out boating today, I was taking pictures with my parents digital camera.  I took some pictures of George Strait's vacation home down here.  I felt like I was paparazi!  For a split second I got sorta excited, and then I remembered Princess Diana, and had to have a moment of silence.  Poor Princess DIE... er.. Di.  Why so cynical?  WHY?  I dunno, it's fun.    Is it strange that nearly EVERY night as I drift off to sleep, I take an imagination-guided walk-through of my future home, and exactly how I want it?  I kind of think that's weird.  I picture everything.  It's not even some fantasy-huge place.  Just a really cool condo in some big city, in a big building.  How whack is that though?  I never really thought about it, but I guess it's odd.  I did it last night as I was falling asleep again.  I focused on my bedroom and bathroom a lot last night, and like clockwork, I was asleep in an instant.  I just start walking around (in my mind) from room to room, picturing how I want everything, where I want everything, what it will look like.  It's a DAMN good layout and design too, if I do say so myself.  You should come visit sometime.  Let me know if you want directions to my mind, and I'll draw you a map.  I'm a freak.
