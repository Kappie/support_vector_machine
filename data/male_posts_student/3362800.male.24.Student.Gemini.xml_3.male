Feel so happy to have friends that really can work together and have fun together.  Although I am already 24, but, I am still hungry in learning new things.Learn to be mature and treat a gal well.  My hope, always is to get my dream gal as my galfren.I did something wrong and I'll always feel guilty. Never forget about the lesson.  I love my darling,forever.Although she might not want to be my galfren anymore.But, I will never forget her.I will try my best to give her my best.   Hoped that everything is fine....
