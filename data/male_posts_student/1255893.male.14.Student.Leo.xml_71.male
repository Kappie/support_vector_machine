I was all set to visit Ave for the last time until December. Well if this were a pretty story, I'd be tellin you that I got there and had a great time, a few laughs, and plenty of new friends. well it's nothing like that at all, as you might have guessed. As it turns out, our van broke down on the way there. We had gotten more than half way there, and our cell phone had been stolen while my brother was at orientation for UCR. This was the whole family by the way. Me, my mom, my dad, my sis and my bro. So of course, as we were WALKING home (10 miles or so) my dad and Lj took turns carrying her. Luckily by nightfall my dad had called a friend of ours to pick us up around devonshire and reseda. This I would say is the mid way point between our breakdown and home. while we awaited our pickup, mommy was entertaining us w/ memories and storylines from one of their favorite spanish soap operas.  The whole way I was thinking to myself  " Damnit, the last thing I said to her face to face was I'll be MORE angry if i dont get to go " hehe. Lots of good that would do. I wouldn't want my parents thinking it was their fault I was angry. they would think that too. and then I would get yelled at for thinking that. even if i told them I was only pissed cus i couldn't go. We got home around 9pm. The time i was supposed to get picked up from the party. coinkidink? Once in I speedily went over to check messages. thankfully ave had left a message w/ the phone number to where she was. So i called and i explained what Ive been explaining to you people so far. Her mom even offered to pick me up to go to the party, but I might not have had a ride back. All that's left to do now is stuff my face w/ mexican food.    On the up side though (lil kids ask " there's and upside?") I know *shockshock*. I made a few realisations along the way home.   - #1 : I am the poster child for emo.  - #2 : I am the poster child for OLd Navy and Levi's as well. - #3 : walking long distances w/ you're family is a great way to build up stress ( especially if you're older bro and younger sis are REALLY annoying along the way. - #4 : shopping carts make for great relief when carrying a nagging sister and uncomfortable materials (for example : sandals, shirt, gatorade bottles) - #5 : people always seem to know how you feel, even if their wrong.
