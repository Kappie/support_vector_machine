I know one day I will be in the same position as Dharmesh-bhai and will be exponentially more excited!  Wow, I'm a geek.  Anyway, that will be really great, but until then I will make do with what I have ;)  We need to start planning the dance early.  I think this time we should do one that even the baby can enjoy.  After all, its HER party!  Well, bye for real now Bigger better post from Dharmesh bhai tomorrow :) -Me
