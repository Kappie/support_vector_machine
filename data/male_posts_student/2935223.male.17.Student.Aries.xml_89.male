I feel bad for you guyses, bein' sad and depressed sux a lot.   My dad bought me the Wicked Soundtrack...I've listened to it probably over 20 times so far. It just rocks so much.  I like cookies. I like 'em a lot. I'm eatin' sum right now.  Man, the last two days have just been full of ego boosters. First, after swimmin' at Kathleens with a bunch of people. When I got re-dressed, I put on my shirt not buttoned up, too much work, and everyone was complimentin' me and stuff....I felt special. They even took pictures!  Then today I went and hung out with Kyle, Molly, Kathleen, and Ashley for a while, still wearin' the same clothes from yesterday because I spent the night at Ervin's. Stupid Ervin for pushing me up against the wall. >:-( I was a "hippy" today too, I didn't wanna put on any socks, so I didn't, then I kept my shirt unbuttoned most of the day, too damn lazy. Eventually we went back to Kathleen's after goin' to McD's to bug Ervin at work. XD Where we sat around for a long time outside, and Kyle said the best line ever: Me:Why the hell is so hot outside? Kyle:It might be because it's summer, but don't quote me on that. It was seriosuly great. We eventually went inside to the AC*\/\/007!* and then Zack and ashley left, after the saddest game of Cherades ever! Then we decided to watch A Knight's Tale, because neither Molly or I had seen it. Then after that was done, we went outside and played basketball for a really long time.  Dang, all the cookies are gone now. X(  This is so wierd. Ervin and I are single, Steve has a girlfriend, and Kyle is on a date as we speak. You would think Ervin and I would have girlfriends, Steve would be on a date*with eighty girls* and Kyle is single. The world has turned upside-down! OH NO!!! Hold on for dear life.*slip* SHIT!  Alright, I'm just wierd now......Peace Out!  Spense  P.S. LESS THEN 12 HOURS UNTIL I GET MY BRACES OFF!!!!
