The slightly rough edge on the back of one of my teeth that my tongue keeps rubbing against 4. The blinking light on my wireless ethernet card 5. The sound of other people turning pages  6. Why there's so much dust in the little holes in my laptop speakers 7. How slowly the sun seems to set if you watch it through the window  8. My fingernails 9. The fingernails of the person sitting across from me in the library 10. Why the air conditioning vent is shaped that way 11. Whether I can make it to Ben  Jerry's before "Free Cone Day" ends at 8:00, and whether there'll be a long line  12. The zipper on my backpack.  Zip open.  Zip closed.  Zip open.  Zip closed. 13. The "No New Messages" message in the corner of my Outlook Express :)
