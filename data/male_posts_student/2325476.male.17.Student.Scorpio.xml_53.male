So, umm.... yea, go listen to Rika Muranaka. Oh, and you should check out the OCRemix from one of her songs that (her song was used as the ending theme for Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty) which can be found here:  urlLink http://www.ocremix.org/detailmix.php?mixid=OCR00945 . This is a remix of  Can't Say Goodbye To Yesterday , which isanother great tune.   Anyway, in recent news, I had a lovely chat with Miss Mary Kate Walthizzall the other day at the Fairibou. Itfinally sunk in that she (and many others) is leaving soon. :( Makes me so sad. Then I was meeting Sturge for lunch at Salsaritas today, and who did we run into but Sally, Kaitlyn, and Rachel. So we joined forces and formed a band the likes of which have NEVER been seen!!! Oh wait, wrong thing... but yeah, we did join forces, and had a big lunch/convo. Well, enough excitement for a few days. Back to my hermitage. :) Peace!   . . .   LISTEN TO RIKA MURANAKA!!!! ... bitches, lol.
