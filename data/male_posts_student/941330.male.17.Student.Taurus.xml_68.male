You are very tentative in the world and introverted with people--which means you are the shy and silent type. Hence the Internet. But behind your reserved exterior lies a dedicated person with a passion for the concrete truth who wants to, in his heart of hearts, help find missing children. God bless you.  urlLink Un-telligence Test : Sorry about the bad news. For the record, you are: 43% Un-telligent! which is significantly lower than the current average of 60%. Here is the report of your personality that led our team of geeks to conclude that you are hopeless in the pursuit of manhood:   "The subject shows a very high level of intelligence, and his sense of observation is one of his best qualities. He shows a lot of potential, but that's only part of the equation. Also, as much as we hate violence, an occasional mauling is one way to solve day-to-day problems like unpleasant coworkers or pesky door-to-door salesmen; he just isn't tough enough, sir, and he avoids any solution that involves violence. Finally, the subject displayed a poor (and a little boring) sense of humor, a fair and productive sense of morality, and a lack of self-confidence."  urlLink Pickup Test : You are 45% pickup-able! You're like Jen. Do you know my friend Jen? You're just like herï¿½she's like this cool girl who's attractive and funny. I should call Jen. Or maybe you're like my friend Steve. Regardless, you like to flirt, but not with ugly people. And when you lock eyes with the right person, you know how to turn the sparks into a towering inferno. But sometimes you won't give people the time of day, which is mean when they really need to know what time it is. In general, make sure you smell good.  urlLink Inner Child Test : Your inner child rides you like the hollow donkey that you are, for it is the Li'l Dictator (Normal Spoiled Functional Adult). Brutal, cold and demanding, he rules you with an iron diaper. He recites long speeches of your demise, herds the emotions together in detention centers and generally just makes any pleasure you may have punishable by firing squad. In order to help yourself, the first thing you need to do is revolt, coup or all out assasinate the little bugger. Perform psycological warfare on him. You may get lost in the struggle for independence, but future generations will sing your name. Stay away from open balconies, though. He likes to push.  urlLink Dateable Test : Damn, Rico! You are 71% dateable! Attractive and confident, witty and charming, a healthy ambrosia-based diet...you're wanted in the 48 contiguous states, you slayer. Call me. Seduce me. Make me a woman (or man.) Not only do you know how to turn a girl's (or guy's) engines on, but you also know how to oil, lube and rotate it. You put the "elation" back into "relationship," and the "night" back into "one-night stand."  urlLink Best Friend Test : Joyous trumpets and champagne supernovas! You are 71% rock-solid friend! The Three Musketeers. The Three Amigos. The Three Horsemen of the Apocalypse? You belong, dude, you belong! Some people put their neck on the line for their friends; you put your ass on the line. And by the way, nice ass. People know they can count on you in a crunch, in a jam, and in other food metaphors describing times of desperation. You give the gift of hope, but more importantly, you give the gift of kidney. Your rewards in life will be great, or at least better than other people's. To quote a fortune cookie: "You are soon have a fortunate experiences." Damn you  urlLink Spark ! Damn you!
