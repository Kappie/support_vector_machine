When bought, I told my insurance company it would be driven about 10,000 miles a year. Pretty generous, seeing that beforehand I was driving about 3000 miles a year--just to work and back, mostly. But with a new car--a car that won't have to be in the shop every other week--my driving urges became more ferocious. Now there are over 20,000 miles on my car, in only the first 16 months. I am also planning on driving to Toronto, Pittsburgh, and Nashville within the coming weeks. Which reminds me, I better get my oil changed. And my tires rotated! Hell, I drove 150 miles today and I can't even remember where I went. Well, better get to bed, I've got a long drive tomorrow as well.
