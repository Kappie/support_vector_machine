Went back to PJC to get the VCD of the official opening, but got sooooo caught up in meeting my old pals and listening to hopeless bands that I forgot to get it. Jun reminded me. Just got off the phone with her. She's a real sweetheart. Hey Jun! I know you're reading this! yes you are.... gucci guccii goooo... Anyway, I was very happy when I got back to PJ. It's like Fairfield. And Pioneers, that's an honor.  I felt forgotten coz I went back to FMSS to get my year-book. I realized that my picture wasn't in Talentime which Oracion won, or in Joie de Vivre, which I soloed in. So dissed. But what the hell lah, I remember and people that matter remember. I'm just trying to make myself feel better. And to all you wonderful overly enthusiastic critics reading this, there isn't anything wrong with feeling dissed. It's called a human emotion. I don't want to be forgotten. I want to be remembered. My life will not be normal coz I can dream and I will keep dreaming. Oh, but Zel's got pretty photos up, and I'm on the same page. So honored... Really. I love my Fairfield and I love my choir. It's my baby.  Told a friend something profound today. IT just came out. Was pleased and thought for a second that I just might be abit special. She asked me if it was wrong to like someone else when you're with someone else. I told her that in life, many puzzle pieces will fit, but only one will be a perfect match for the shade of blue or the other half of the circle. Basically, I told her that she shouldn't be tied down to one fella if another fella is better suited for her. However, I didn't agree with justifying it, upon which I presented several counter arguments. I'm sentimental.  I can dispense good advice, yet practical application is an obstacle. For the record, I'm going to say that though I'd done many dumbass things with/to Zel while I was in secondary school, I am happy with the way I was. I'm afraid I'm changing, becoming less expressive, or, more subdued. Like in a zoo or circus where they whip you and tame you and teach you tricks. Stand on one leg Tim. "ok master". Will write more in upcoming entries if it still burns, which it will, just like everyday for the past few months.  Remember children, mathematics causes cancer.
