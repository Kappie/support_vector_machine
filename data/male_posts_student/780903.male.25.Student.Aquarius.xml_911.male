Commissioner) cites a case whose name caused me to do a double take:  Swastika Oil and Gas Co. v. Commissioner .  From 1941.  A friend I showed this to, in disbelief, came up with a great line: "Uh, just what kind of  gas  exactly were they making?"  I imagine this company has gone out of business, or at least changed its name -- "no one's buying our gas!"  "maybe it's the flag we're flying outside all our service stations" -- I hope.  And, yes, that was the most interesting part of my tax reading.
