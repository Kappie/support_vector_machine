The food, as always, was excellent. I had peppercrusted swordfish with honey mustard sauce and garlic mashed potatoes. Then, of course, for desert, I had the blackwhite cake. I got it to go and haven't eaten any of it yet. I have a picture of it that I'll post. It is incredible. Of course, I tried to pay for my meal, and Britt's mom would only let me pay $10 of the like $40 it cost. So she told me to also buy her a beer at the Braves game, which wasn't a problem. Braves lost, which wasn't very good, but we had fun and the seats were great. Then, on the way home, me and his mom started talking about music and I told her the Allman Brothers were coming to the Fox September 24-26 and she was like "Let's go" and I was like "Well, my dad said he wouldn't pay for me a ticket and I don't have any money." She told me not to worry about it, that she'd take care of it, and that Britt, her, and myself would go on September 26th. I called her and let her know what tickets were available when I got in the house and she said she would buy them tonight or tomorrow morning. His mom is awesome...I feel bad because I always try to give her money and she refuses to take it. Oh well, I love my Aunt Rhonda! Hahaha! Here is the Dailey's cake:   I'm out. Amie comes home tomorrow :-)
