Name    KERRY    Bush    Date      Time/CNN   51%  46%  5/13/04     CNN/UST/Gallup   50%  46%  5/9/04     ARG    46%  44%  5/6/04     AP/Ipsos   41%  44%  5/5/04     Fox/OD   43%  46%  5/5/04     Gallup   49%  47%  5/4/04     Quinnipiac   43%  44%  5/3/04     NBC/WSJ   42%  46%  5/3/04      Interesting isn't it? I now have a limerick. I will be posting a new limerick with every post.  There was a young plumber of Leigh Who was plumbing a girl by the sea. 	She said, "Stop your plumbing, 	There's somebody coming!" Said the plumber, still plumbing, "It's me."  LOL. Any hooters. Today was boring. We didn't do much, except we talked about fellatio. It was funny. For those of you who don't know what it means:  fellatio, fellation -- (oral stimulation of the penis)  I hope this helps. Well I am going to go. I may post more later.
