But then again, stupidity coupled with anything results in dire results. When will people understand this? If they spent more of their time taking care of their child instead of just banning shit from them, there would be less violence in youths. Or at least I think it would.  ANYWAY, despite being a gamer, there is a certain kind of gamer that I abhor, because they make perfect scapegoats to prove how games are bad for you. Not that I blame those lying the blame on these idiotic individuals, I more blame it on the parents of these people. I believe some people should never have sex, and you get these kinds of people as a result.  All quotes after this message are from the forums of  urlLink www.gamefaqs.com  , and are unedited. WARNING- STUPIDITY AHEAD    On a topic on hookers in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas    smithi3 said ... "Man I hope you can see hookers like doing stuff to you in the game maybe just there head bobbing up and own in your lap wud b good and you feeling their boobs man that would rool this game wud b the best game 4eva"    In reply to the statement of "You are a very lonely man, aren't you?"    smithi3 said ... "yeh but it would be cool like they were doing it to you in real life  uhh uhhhhhh unghhhhhh unghhhhh"   My Notes : See? All women reading this should go date a nerd right now, to prevent serial rapists from arising later on in life. Lack of sex and physical contact creates sad people such as the wise smithi3 above.    On “what you will do when you pick up GTA San Andreas for the first time?”    Solid-Steve(gs) said ... " 1.KILL  2.KILL  3.KILL"        My Notes : Regular Charlie Manson this fellow, he will go far in life. Or he’ll get bum-raped in jail. EITHER WAY…    On “What is the funniest thing you have said about Ragnarok Online in real life?”    ShinyKirby said … “About RO in real life?I tried to say to my sister, "I killed the MvP!"Instead, it came out as "I killed the NPC!"   My Notes : Oh, ShinyKirby, how you make me blush. Your wit is ever so droll! Please, I don’t even think a person with an emotional IQ of 200 would laugh at that.    On “What WWE Diva You Like The Most”    ssjgamer said … “Torrie Willson... I love the part of her intro where it shows her live-action and she bends over and pulls down her...Yeah.”   My Notes : Oh yes, I love pixelated boobs as much as the next bloke.    On “Stat of Lib in Spider-Man 2”    spike17spiegel said … “WTF is "Stat of Lib"? Was it extreamly hard to add y to that Stat of your and to add erty to Lib. Lazy fool”   My Notes : *giggles* Staty of Liberty. He didn’t spell extremely right either.    On “Rikku’s (from Final Fantasy X and X-2) Cup Size”    Tidus is cool said … “By The Looks Of It...Its Definitely Smaller Then a "A" cup. lol...she barely has anything.”   Smokingfrog2 said … “Maybe she should wear a wonderbra, or maybe she just got a reduction, because auron said he was going to feel her...”   My Notes : Why the fuck do you care? I mean honestly!    On “Where to find Dear or Alive hentai pictures in ‘compromising’ positions”    Ssj2joe said … “go to hentaiparadise.com (check the spelling). There are some nice DOA doujins there. Also try e-hentai.net. OR, search the name of a doa char on google image search. (like "kasumi") ENJOY.”   My Notes : Which is sadder, the fact that somebody asked for the pics, or that somebody had already voyaged for them before?  ANYWAY, that concludes this session for today… I’ve seen enough for one day.
