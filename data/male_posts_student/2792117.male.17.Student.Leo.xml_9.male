Haiz, today as usual got trg, but today one is rehearsal 4 this comin sat. DC visit. Haiz, n y ther r pple who like to the calls e shot, e black chinese guy… haiz. Becoz of his character nowadays mi attitude him liao, wa lau, I his senior n nv show repect one lor, e same way he treat other pple, n also suck up to pple one.. haiz… this type of pple, although he has e leadership I muz say. Still can rem last time, when they were sec 2, abt to take over tt time, waaa, damm guai.. listen to me bla bla bla, show respect to many pple, n when take over liao, hack care us luike shit liddat. Smt feel like punching his dark skin face. 	Anyway, regarding the unit, I tink I can really step down liao lor, now I pass the admin backto Cis, n how they wanna settle is their prob. Oya, even though today I said many times abt attendance taking, I tink nobody in the end took the trouble to take the attendance of their squad. Coz this batch they hac care admin one I noe., b4 becoming NCOs, all dream of goin to trg dept liao, whu will care admin n log????  	Also, aft trg heard frm mr.low, tt npcc may be closed down to form another uniform group, merging the police n civil defence to form a home team uniform group. In some sense aft mi givin much tot to it, I think this oplan would be beta coz CD will not be left out, although npcc has courses wif CD. This merge I tink will increase e variety of activities like first aid n other CD stuffs lor. but is sad to hav npcc close down. But I tink this plan may start aft when I completed my years of CI if can lar..
