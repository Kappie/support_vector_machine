I have never been a documentary kinda guy, but something as provacative and occasionally funny as farenheit 9/11.....It is cleverly developed, showing just enough to leave you wanting more (but if they showed much more it would be boring, repetitive, and distasteful). Apparantly the soldiers listen to music while bombing people....One soldier listens to "The Roof Is On Fire" and then he starts singing (rather untalented, but who am I to judge!) "We don't need no water let the motherf****rs burn". Of course it WASN'T censored in the movie, and that along with some graphic footage is the difference between PG/PG13 and 14A. Oh well...At one point I felt like vomitting, and at others I was laughing at "Dubya". See it, you'll get it.
