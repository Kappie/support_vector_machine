That's a long story, I suppose. He'll always be my father, but at the same time it's not really 'my life' here.   Other news, more Kellie drama. I was reading her journal the other day and saw she's having a rough time with her parents and shit. So I got on and talked with her step-sister to make sure that she was alright, then I said it seemed like she needed a friend. I was trying to be nice or whatever, but then the next day I read an entry flaming me. It said: "If I needed a friend I would've come knocking on your door, asshole." =/  I guess nice guys finish last. Although, I dunno, I can't blame her for hating me because of how shit went down. Whatever, I guess it's in the past. Just worries me that we'll be at the same school next year. I don't want anymore drama. Hell, I went shopping at Kohl's today and saw someone that looked like her. It was gut wrenching. I don't wanna see her there, cause that'll just start more shit.   Anyhow, I've decided that the state of Virginia hates me. They make me wait until I'm almost 16 even to get my learner's permit, then they throw stupid questions at me. I don't wanna get into all the details, but I was one question short of my learner's permit. No fun. =/ I've been talking to the people at GameStop. Namely Jimmy and the dude with the Midnight Club II hat (I forget his name >.  Oh, and my dad's birthday is July 31st, that's why I'm down here. I went to Kohl's (where I think I saw Kellie... I didn't wanna confirm) and got him a shirt then over to B to get him a book he wanted. Good stuff.   And my computer news... I'm working on a proramming project over the summer. It's going to be a fully-functional game once I'm completed (I hope). Right now I'm just trying to stream-line the graphics and do buffers and all that jargon. FFXI (Final Fantasy 11, a game I play often) is going good, too. BioWare finally emailed me back... said they'll take a look at my game once it's done. I can't wait until I'm working for a big-time gaming company!   Well, that's about it. Got most bases covered. Friends and me chillin' often, got my games set for the next few months, school supplies are bought. Now all I gotta do is sit back and relax. Hopefully the rest of the summer won't have too much more drama. Until next time...   That is all.
