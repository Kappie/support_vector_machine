When I raise my hand, the veins go back in, when I lower my hand, the veins slowly pop back out. I think it's because there's more pressure of blood in my hand when it's down. My blood is red. Is yours, and are you sure? Ca you be positive? Coz some people I know don't behave like their blood is red. I'd like to believe that people with red blood are human. Animals have red blood too. Maybe they're animals.  I feel talkative and inquisitive tonight. Now mix that with a sad playlist of old memories and you have me sitting here doing this. I remember that I wanted to be a scientist when I grew up. Mummy bought me a book with an acorn on the cover. I lost interest in it quickly because its contents did not interest me that much. Oh! I do remember crystal growing and things like that. Mummy and I, we did the coolest things.  I pulled out of school early today, I did feel down in the morning but that soon left me. I think I convinced myself that I was sick. I climbed out of the back gate and walked to Buona Vista MRT. I passed the primary school. Flashback after flashback. I began to talk to myself. HEY Casey! Help me fold my aeroplane. I brought nice white paper today. You could fold the one with the jaggered wings or the one with that special hole for stability. Wow Casey, Where'd you learn how to do that? When the end of recess bell rang, we'd all run to the porch. I remember I used to have trouble remembering the word porch. I called it the place with the holes in the walls. I used to chill out in the holes. Lean back on the curvature and shut my eyes and watch the light turn red through my eyelids. Oh Gosh! The more I think about it now, The more of the place I can see in my mind. We left the paper planes everywhere. The green grass was littered with white planes of all types. Some were in the eco-pond too. We used to have monkey bar fights. Opponents would start from either side and try to bring the other one down by preferably wrapping their legs around the opponentsâ€™ waist and jerking them downwards. Lynnette with the down syndrome was the queen and Able George was the undisputed boss. He got his pants yanked off one fateful day though. Fateful because he was conveniently not wearing underwear. We used to dab out hands in the bald batch of ground so that we'd get more grip. We were not like the adults with all their chalk and all. So messy, that white powder bowlers and boxers used. We used what was around us. Childish ingenuity. So who ever said being childish was all bad?  My first fight was there, at that volleyball court. Something about Aruna Mohan and Butts and a bitchy Chikgu. I was sent to the ominous Dorothy Ho and she taught me that it took two hands to clap with a practical demonstration. Dorothy Ho is not so scary anymore and the old infrastructure has been changed. The monkey bars are gone along with the paper aeroplane place.  God was good. How ever did he come up with the concept of memory? When you're alone, you're not really alone coz you have characters like Dorothy Ho and Casey to play with over and over again. Like a video archive. A very extensive video archive.  Cheers to all the small things.
