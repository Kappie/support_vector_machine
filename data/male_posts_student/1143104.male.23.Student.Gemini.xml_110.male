By now you are aware that we are starting a life together in just a few short weeks and we want you to be a part of it.  Well aren't you special! ;-)  If we didn't love you we wouldn't have told you! Ok well maybe we just want to gloat a little. ROFL.  But anyway, welcome to our site about our new lives.  Hope you enjoy reading about it!
