I was intending to go home and sleep my mind out, but I tagged along with Cher Hao into Carrefour for snacks. He got some chips, sushi  mix nuts. I was just scanning around the chocolate section, and then I saw meji’s birthday bears! So I went through all the boxes trying to find my birth bear, Cher Hao helped too. We took the boxes off the shelf and were looking like 2 idiots. Guess I was outta luck today, no we didn’t find my bear. Anyway, we stacked the boxes back neater then before we took it down. =x. ok, now it’s his turn to tag along with me. It ACTIONCITY time! There’s new evangelion and onepiece candy toy. Ohya, there was these Haro balls that holds character from earlier gundam series. The Haro looks cute, but its ears doesn’t open (its just one hollow sphere made out of 2 domes)….   I’m home…..zzzZZZ
