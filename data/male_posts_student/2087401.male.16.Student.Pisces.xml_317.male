I also hate the fact that you cannot schedule an event without it being moved due to some previous obligation. On this note JournalCon is at 11:00 on the 31st of January. Come or don't, don't call before, just show up.  I'm probably expecting to much of you to even read this post. The webcomics are calling.  Okay...I've taken a few minutes, gotten a drink of water, had a shot of bourbon and now I'm back.  I propose a moratorium on Webcomics discussion, as well as whatever the hell DM is. Lord of the Rings dorkiness as well as things of actual substance are not banned by this bill, H.Con-175.   Vote in Comments (use Yay or Nay)  Also, Yond Nathan has a lean and hungry look;  He thinks too much, such men are dangerous.
