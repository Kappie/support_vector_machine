Starting Friday night, I was up and out late. I didn't get home until 4 AM Saturday morning from hanging out with Flo and her friends. Then I had work at 9 AM. After work, my mom and I went to go check out cell phone plans and grocery shopping. I did manage to sneak in a nap after dinner, but then I was up watching stupid TV shows like French in Action until 3 AM. Sunday I photocopied readings and checked out some more cell phone plans. Then I was up chatting and stuff un 2 AM. That's not a lot of sleep when you have work at 8:30 AM. So now on to another week of jobbing. I do have the opportunity to have fun this weekend. Either a BBQ with Flo or Ethiopian food with Naomi on Saturday. Decisions... decisions.  ***
