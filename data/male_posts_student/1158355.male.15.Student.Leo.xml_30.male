Everyone, everybody goes by the society around them and doesn't allow themselves to act and appear in certain ways because of the people around them. My advice to you. We're in a society that demands profection of race, sexuality (ok that should be straight), religion, weight, height, dress, and more. Think what you want, dress what you want, do what you want.   Woah, have I been listening to Mr. Shelley? Well, it's true. I put on a head band to prevent myself from sweating when I run. Everyone says "Stop It Grimaldi Your White!". I just don't get it. I wear something to protect my face from sweat and people take it into a racial matter. Let me tell you something. Black people didn't invent clothes. They invent what we invent. We are them. They are us. We are one nation. Other stuff happens too.  Ok, shut up. Well today in track, we ran all the way to Jeroke and back. Fun for 4 miles! That's about it... yea. Angelica you better not make plans for Saturday.
