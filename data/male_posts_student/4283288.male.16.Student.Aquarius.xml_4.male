After, quitting my clan due to my hard as fuck schedule and the fact I wasn't finding scrimming too fun anymore. I finally played after not playing for a whole week. Then I joined some random pub server right after I got home yesterday at about 4:30 PM, and at first my FPS seemed fine, going at 80-99, but nothing horrible. Then, I join a team and spawn and my FPS starts going down to 10 and back to 99 and so forth, and it just wouldn't stop. I'm guessing it was either my drivers had become faulty, or the fact I hadn't restarted in a week or the downloads I had going. I played earlier after restarting and i had 50-99 on de_dust2, so maybe it was my drivers, guess I'll find out.
