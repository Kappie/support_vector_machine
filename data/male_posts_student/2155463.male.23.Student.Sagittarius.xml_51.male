Now before any of you start getting any prurient ides, it was totally benign - I slept for 12 hours straight.  I wasn't feeling so well when I got home, so I went to bed at about 7:00...needless to say, I didn't wake up until 7:30 this morning.  Maybe I'm a little under the weather, and maybe it was kinda make-up for all the stress I didn't realize I had from finals (seriously - I don't think I stressed about finals hardly at all).  Whatever the reason...I felt much better this morning :)  Oh, and more good news for me :)  I got some more money from KSU today (in loans, not free :P), so I might actually be able to go to Washington and EAT while I'm there (although it would probably be better for me if I didn't while I was there...).  And I got all my grades back; I won't gloat (as much as I may want to considering that this semester seemed like the semester from HELL at times), but let's just say my GPA rhymes with "tour." :D  But aside from all that...well, sometimes I wonder why I complain so much.  Maybe because it's nice to just vent, maybe because I feel like people will actually pay attention to me if I make my needs known, maybe because I'm just downright unhappy (and YES, I KNOW THERE ARE STARVING KIDS IN ETHEOPIA, SO I SHOULDN'T BE...if anyone actually believes that, please get over it - there's more than one way to starve).  I'm getting kind of tired of always putting on a "happy face" - it's weird, I actually am happy (usually) when I'm around other people (maybe for that very reason), but when I'm alone I'm usually unhappy (probably because I'm horribly self-critical).  So guess which one I am most of the time?  As always I think it all boils down to my the state of my spirit.  I remember back when I was a kid of 12 or 13, those just seemed like the "good old days"...and it was totally weird, you wouldn't have thought so.  Things were kinda rough at home, I didn't have many friends, I wasn't very active in many things (man, some things just never change)...but there was a sense I had about myself, a contentedness, a tranquility where I knew that whatever happened I was ok, and that gave me a drive to do better, to be better.  All of that is gone now - everything is about  having  to be better, about  having  to do better, about having more, about knowing more - my spirit seems trampled on, underappreciated.  It's stagnating, whithering away, corrupting - I feel like I need to talk to someone who can point me in the right direction, someone who can help me get back to "good."  Because I know until that sense is in my spirit again, whatever else I do won't make me happy in any lasting sense, won't fill the "God-shaped void" yearning open in my soul...
