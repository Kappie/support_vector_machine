I don't know, "local" food away from the locale seems to taste different, as if something is ... lacking. Even when the stores are run by supposed Singapore or Malaysian people in Perth, I somehow find it unlike the stuff we get at home. Maybe it's psychological, I dunno. But I'm sure many people understand where I'm coming from with this. I guess it's not just the food, but it's the atmosphere as well -- the hustle and bustle of noisy kopitiams, redolent with the odours of Malaysian and Western foods aplenty. The blind coming by to seek donations; the buskers who sing out of tune; the lottery-ticket sellers; the kopitiam workers who most times ignore you when you need to order a drink, and only come running when it's time to pay up; the pirated VCD stalls nearby lighting up the five-foot-ways; the occasional night market packed with throngs of people who aren't there to do anything but kill time; the frequently unbalanced tables perched precariously by roadsides where at any moment a lunatic Malaysian driver could ram into you and kill you... it's all part of the fun. It's all part of the eating experience. And I'm sorry, no offence to the Perthlings, but  that's  what might be lacking. Strange, isn't it, how the environment affects our tastebuds...  Here's a little online hug for my pal Jase and his little (or not so little) car crash. Thankfully he's fine. Check out his blog in the link section. And here's a wave to Dave and Vincci, two old friends back in my studying days in Sydney (that's a story for another time), who I've had the pleasure of reestablishing contact with online. Cheers to you guys! :) And finally, salutations and heartfelt bitchiness to Terry, of course! Heh! Buhbye for now!
