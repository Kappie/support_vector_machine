Some of them are from GEP too! Some schools they are from: RI, ACSi, DHS, NYGH, CGSS (Cedar Girls), MSHS (Maris Stella) and CHS (Catholic High School; not THE Chinese High School. That's TCHS)  We had lots of fun today. (As usual) Lots of laughs and cheers. The teacher rocks. (he's from TCHS. lol)  Yeah.  I went to the St Francis Xavier church (the church i always go to). I went to the Multipurpose Centre for our usual Sunday mornings youth gathering (according to levels i.e. sec 1s, sec 2s, sec 3s, etc.) It was just as fun.   I think Sunday is social day. I met more friends from many other schools (some are the same as those above), plus plus.   I love Sundays :) ... The only downside to Sundays is that if I can't finish my work on Saturday, I'll have to do it today... :(  Haiz. Exactly. I'm busy working on my History Assignment : "The Isthmus of Kra"... Its due on the 16th of July (5 days to go...) Better hurry up..  That's all for today. (as of now)
