Woohoo!  I missed you all, but   you  especially.  It was so sweet that you called, but everyone else started cracking jokes.  Like calling me Wesley-San (HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?!  Thats like calling an American a Limey!).  It was sweet though, and just what I needed, since Ryan/Sonja Jess/Eleanor were cuddling up and making me feel blah.  I got burnt on my arms and back and front.  Kinda bad.  Yeah, I'll make sure never to say that I don't burn (I don't when I have sun block!).  So I had to apply some ointment.  Hahah, ointment.  Thats always the answer.  Got a rash?  Ointment.  Cut?  Ointment.  Burn?  Ointment.  Infection?  Ointment.  My arms are killing me from all the lifting I did, not to mention my freaking bag.  It was too...... heavy.  Wow, this is turning into a whine-fest.  Sonja reminded me that I was a whiner when I was little one.  I remember........  Every 1/10 old couples were over tan.  Old.  Over.  Tan.  Just..... wrong...........  What really was nice was all the relaxation I got and all the nes I played, oh man, that ruled.    I was stuck doing a lot of homework at the end, which was lame and apparently I missed out on a nice everglades excursion.  Aw.  BUT I HAVE PICTURES OF THE CONDO!  TALK TO ME IF YOU WANT TO SEE!!!!!  Hmmm... but there were two things that totally fucked the vacation up at the end, and I had to lie kind've to say I was happy. 1. The breakage of the screen (its pretty much all better, cept for the cracks, damnit) 2. Although this may be my place to write, I can't write this one here.  Hm, ok, I thought about it and I am gonna get 2 towers on DVD.  Sometime this week maybe if I am not killed by homework.   Did I say that when I went on my lonesome walk I glanced up on a shooting star?  I was completely alone on that beach, and I made my little wish 20 minutes later, eh.  Ok, thats as much as I think I can recall.
