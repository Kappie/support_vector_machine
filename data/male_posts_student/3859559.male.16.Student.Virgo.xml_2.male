What is it with girls and thinking that they must tell everyone everything. I don't go around tellin people shit about her and I'd expect the same from her, but no such luck. So I've come to the conclusion that any girl you get into a relationship suck. They will change after a while and make your life miserable. They think thatkiss means something more than it is and will play you and tease you until you don't know what is goin on. I suggest that all men out there don't stay in a relationship. Mearly use a girl to fill your sexual needs then lose em'. It' s a lot less trouble in the end and you don't get our heart ripped out by a cold hearted bitch.  Okay I know this is harsh, but you have to understand. Why invest your time and money in some girl you will break up with in the next few months when you can find a girl that is looking for the same thing you are, a good screw with no attachments. Okay yeah I miss the relationship because you always have someone you can call on when you need, but it just dosen't pay off in the end. You love em' they leave you. That's the way it goes.   You may care, but if they don't realize it you're fucked. Okay comunicate with the bitch and maybe she will realize how much you love them and would never want to hurt them. You will always do something wrong though it's just the way it is. So for your sake I hope you have a tolerent women and maybe you will get your second chance. God knows I never will get another.   From this day on as god as my witnes I swear of all emotional attachment with a women.
