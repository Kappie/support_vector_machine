Me, Jordan(the other one), and Brandon all go out and get supplies. This is were we go wrong we start inviting people that Friday and the party is Saturday. Much to Jordan and Brandons supprise most people have plans already and not many show up. DUH!!! I tried to tell them, but no they are hard headed and the party ends up being us and a few close friends with nothing else to do. So the party was a drag. I tried to make the bestof things and enjoy the food, pool, and music though. I stuck with them cause they are my friends, but I'm still pissed that I threw away a potentially fun weekend.
