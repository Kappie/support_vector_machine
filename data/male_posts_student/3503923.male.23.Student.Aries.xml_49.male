Skipping from letter to letter, trying to spell a word that makes sense, to know a direction that is sure. What would I like to take on this journey of mine? Not a lot. A happy heart, good memories, and a knowledge of my destiny. It began in Kontula; the Chicago of Finland, with burning cars and drunken maniacs. The ghetto has received a face-lift, our former block of flats has experienced the process of re-generation, now offering luxury accommodation to the Kontula gangsters.   urlLink     From deepest darkest Kontula we fled like a bullet out of an AK-47 into the peace of Kauklahti. I'd skate on the river in the winter, float my way down stream on a polystyrene raft during summer. We'd snap up tired fish from the river banks, when they stopped to rest from their struggle up river. We lived next door to stable. I rode a horse, a clapped out mare. Touched the fence, that electric fence. Note of caution: never wee on an orange fence at the perimeter of a field.      A move on foot to next door. A massive garden, fit for a football pitch. Unfortunately, Dad made me join Kakka-Pyllyt to play football on the nasty gravel with other hyperactive little boys, leaving him a huge patch of ground for potato cultivation. I understand though, the potatoes were far more likely to feed the family than any future income from my footballing talents. Wise move Dad. Go for potatoes over football any day.     The river that runneth through Kauklahti. Our beloved Suikero made its maiden voyage along here some 10 years ago. We spent hours after school painting our canoe; it was red and yellow, named Suikero, after a cheesy crisp very similar to a Wotsit. To our horror, the river also ended up being Suikero's grave; I found it half sub-merged on my way back home from school. I was distraught.     Kuusakoski. Our favourite play-ground, full of interesting scrap, most of which was crap. We'd hide underneath a huge tarpaulin covering the remains of a jet engine. We'd sneak our way inside the warehouse, riffling through piles of junk, carrying off with us computer components that we believed to be coated in gold. Fools gold.     Burning down the house. Not my handy work. I was rather shocked to find this old house in this state. A school friend of mine used to live here, maybe he still does; the basement could be OK still. Who knows? I wouldn't be surprised if Tillin Toni had something to do with it. He once had a vendetta against the school, and like any angry young Finnish boy, he traipsed to the school with a match box in his hands. School is out for summer, school is out forever! God Bless you Toni, where-ever you may be, hope the fire has reached your heart by now.      I loved this house. We met the Simpsons here, the seventy proof rum, a box of nuuska, to name but a few of the interesting additions into the world of an innocent teenager. Skate-boards, which stayed under my bed. Rap music, that I did not understand. Baggy trousers, for both you and me. Home brewed apple wine in an alley way up the street. Never again. Apples=Cider, Grapes=Wine, apples do not equal wine. Our third and best Sauna, Terva drops, sizzling beer, clean behind the ears, exhausted from the heat. Lovely.     You know when you are in a Finnish Metro. Inconspicuous it is not. Impossible to fall asleep. Hard seats that numb your back-side, the orange so loud it screams in your ears. Fast though, without the hindrance of those white gloved chaps who shove you in, or the 'skin closeness' of the tube.     Bigger feet, more energy, different perspective, small world. It's all home.
