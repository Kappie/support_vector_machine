It’s great and it’s worth every penny. I've used it so much already; I would suggest that everyone gets one.  There is a lot of news to post and I don't have time to do it now, I'm off to see the Bourne Supremacy curse my hectic life.  One thing can't wait. After a few false starts, I'd just like to say congratulations to my good friends Shaun Warren and Sarah May on their wedding yesterday.  Next time someone wants me to wear a suit in that weather I'll tell them where to stick it.  Tim
