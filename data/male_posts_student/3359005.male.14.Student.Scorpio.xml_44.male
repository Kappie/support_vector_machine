It was really an experience for me, cause I kept thinking of Amazing Race possibilities. Now who said Amazing Race could never come back here cause there's nothing left to do?  We were kind of stuck trying to find an illegal carpark somewhere along the street, cause there was no friggin space. My mom was wondering why people were starting to wear Red Shirts so early, something that I really laughed hard at. It's not like Christmas which starts early at November, mom! Apparently the prospect of National Day parade preview had never occured to her. Those cheap Singaporeans are out only for the freebies, who cares which day you go on?   Ok... Enough with the Singapore bashing, which will cease for the moment cause everyone that's feeling so patriotic will kill me. We went to this apparently famous for seafood restaurant, where there seemed to be some gravy left on the "cleaned" table by a very generous previous patron. I sat as far away from the table as I possibly could without looking too snobbish. My usual elbows on the table were drawn uncomfortably to myself. I drank the tea, which had some black dust inside. I couldn't help but to wonder whether it was cigarette dust or tea leaf residue. Unrealistic me... What are the chances of it being the former compared to the latter right? I don't even want to think about it.  The food was pretty good, but I much rather have stayed in the comforts of my home and da-paoed something from the Cze Cha just down the road. It apparently also got 5/6 chopsticks from Makansutra, which was the same as the restaurant we just went to. Anyway we got some of the famous Tanjong Rhu Pao and went back to our car. On the way back, we had to cross an overhead bridge. One half of the stairs leading up was occupied by creepy Indian men, and they all seemed so coordinated, sitting on one side. It was like in that childhood story, with the scary beast under the bridge that threatened to eat up anyone who tried to cross. We opted to brave the never ceasing current of cars instead.  There seemed to be some soliciting going on, right next to our car! The Indian man then proceeded to convieniently lean on our car when we were just a few metres away. I couldn't help but to pass a comment to my Dad saying, "Dad, there's a pimp on your car!" The Indian Man pulled away, and they carried their dealings somewhere else. I can't imagine how many deals my car must have seen through the night. Anyway, that's all for my experience in Geylang! I still have some paos left!
