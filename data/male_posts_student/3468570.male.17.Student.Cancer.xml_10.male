She's been appearing in everything on TV, even joining Ivy Lee in some crazy slimming advertisement where all the crazy men just go after Ivy Lee and she closing the slimming centre door on them. I hope Ng Hui's turn won't do the same or else I'm gonna' bring a rifle to Mediacorp~! =) =) =)  Hmmm...speakin' of yesterday I've been showing my friend the picture of Mutya's ugly piercing. ((It's a piercing~! Her name's Mutya! WAHAHAHAHAH! I dunnoe why I find Mutya Buena of Sugababes so funny especially in Hole in the Head  Round Round which makes me super tickled~!! [And they will go on as 'What's so funny?'])) Okay, enough it's super-lame~! I doubt anyone can understand it.  Sob sob~!! Holiday's coming to a close~!!! But...there's a but there...((following Miss Poon of 2000)) I found one way to insult girls indirectly! Note this word 'Ladies of Virtue', but it means 'Prostitutes' in fact. It's so fun to call girls this kind when they say thank you in response! =D  Whoooooo.....I'm writin' this long and not a single word of la Lingua Japonaise? Mmmm...this is so un-FRENCH~! And I wonder how many bonnets will I laugh at this time? Le French Kolina est la Frenchman et le Rendezvous et le Depot. By the way, 'depot' is pronounced in English as 'depo', not 'depot'! 'Debut' is pronounced as 'debyu', and not 'de-but!'!   わたしは今日Ｙａｈｏｏ！チャットを入ますよ！チャット人々はレムでございますよ！人がへんたいで、目的は日本女の子を出逢うことでございます。そして、いまは終わりですよ。休みよ！左様奈良！
