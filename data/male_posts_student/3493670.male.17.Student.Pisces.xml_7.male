And they're not necessarily symptomatic of what two people had together. There are two sides in a break up and the stories both parties may share. Sometimes, I wanna remind people never to take sides nor judge the other person involved simply because they don't know the other person's side.       I am writing this journal for a special someone who was trashed, slandered and insulted on the net by a bitter ex girlfriend who wrote a journal about their break up. Suffice to say, I am hurt for this person because none of the people who read the journal listened or at least attempted to ask him for his side of the story. These fucking idiots were so moved by the other person's journal that they simply started taking sides in a snap. They were giving out snide comments like "he aint worth it", "He's an asshole", and all that crap. And what disappoints me the most is that, some of them have never been into a relationship to give out comments like that. I'm not saying that I am an expert in relationships but I have enough guts to actually say that it is none of their concern. This break up is about two people and no one else should be involved.      I wanna write more about this journal but I am way too pissed to even continue. Am gonna go punch a wall muna.
