Of all the things I have seen during my wanderings, the shell of a proud man is by far the worst. The closest thing I can compare it to would be a lion with a shaved head. One knows the mane was once there, and was beautiful, but that’s where the beauty ends: a memory. There comes a time in a man’s life when he runs out of battles to fight. When that time approaches he will do one of two things: he will lay down his arms, or he will fight battles that are not his.   I'm just beginning to realize how much my writing style was affected by  Catcher in the Rye . Not quite so much in that excerpt, but in other areas. Like this paragraph, later on:    Anyway, I was in my typical state: dirty, tired, and hungry. My appearance must have been greasy and borderline intimidating. I wouldn’t know for sure … I try to avoid seeing my reflection if I know I don’t look good. Some people have a dread fascination with bad reflections, but I’ve never liked those kinds of people. They tend to be both depressed and depressing.   Definite J.D. Salinger influence, I think. I enjoy writing in first person - it's so much more interesting to read than third. It gives me a chance to write with some tone, rather than a detached, apathetic kind of narration. By the way, this stuff is rough draft material and is therefore likely to change. Anyway, that's a sample of my crap. I don't know how interesting it is, but oh well. I'm not forcing you to read.
