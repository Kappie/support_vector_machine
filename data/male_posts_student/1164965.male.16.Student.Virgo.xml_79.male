One about "supporting the loving conservative BUSH administration", and the other "Support Anti-War movement". Kind of hilarious. Yeah if you haven't figured out, Google (the owner of blogger), periodically "reads" your blogs and accordingly put appropriate banner ads on top. So our posts about drafts, holocaust probably caused google to put those ads up.  And Megan, that quote there from Night is really insightful. Especially the part of "if we forget, we are guilty". (That's why history, historiography, and historical literature is so important). And finally Rob, to bring up that draft thing into perspective, it was actually two democrats who first initiated the plan. They think it would "democratize" the army system. Because they think it's not fair for a special group of people to fight. And of course many many Republicans support their plans, it helps them win their ambition of occupying Iraq. But yeah, there is some level of extremely scary muti-partisan support of the draft in the congress right now.
