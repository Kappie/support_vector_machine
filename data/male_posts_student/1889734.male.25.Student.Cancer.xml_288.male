You better have evidence that the arab with the trench coat (never mind it is 100 degrees) has ill intent before you do anything!  When will we reach our tolerance for bloodshed over there?  When will we finally have enough and really address the problem?  The international community seems to accept the steady death and destruction, so long as it doesn't stir up anything resembling a solution.
