One of the most important is that I've obtained  the  actual sheet music for  the  actual Maple Leaf Rag. Interesting name: yes.  Awesome skill requirement and totally rewarding song: yes. So it evens itself out.  In fact, i'm listening to a clip of that song right now.  Absolutley amazing.  Also in that time space was the action packed Friday. I had a birthday party I had to go to, and immideatly after that some of my friends had a gig at a coffee shop. The well known Kaffe Bona.  I took a ride with a friend (Some call him.....tim?) and not only was he conveniently going to the birthday party right after practicing for the gig at my house, but he was also playing at the gig after the birthday party, so getting a ride wasn't an obstacle.  After the birthday party which conveniently provided dinner, i didn't even plan to eat anything and I still got food, we played poker and did the whole present thing....except i forgot mine...but that will change soon. I played some piano and was out the door to walmart.  Tim's fingers were pretty much eaten away the by the guitar strings, so we needed superglue so his fingers wouldn't hurt and he could solo.  Off to walmart, off to....which aisle would superglue be in? Tim thought that the aisle with medical supplies would work, cause if you get a cut you need something that will stay on it right? I told him that the rest of the civilized world used band-aids...except for his neighbor , then told him that we needed to go through teacher supplies.  So we did, and in the middle of his sentence about why woud someone put superglue in the teacher supplies there it was. Score.  Got the glue now on to the cash register! We found an empty express lane, but the guy had to go find a ten dollar bill for change, so we ended up waiting for around three minutes.  Once we were in the car, we had to maneuvre through the parking lot full of medians. Kaffe Bona was packed. It's a relatively small place to begin with, but with this many people (they raked in quite the audience...and money for Kaffe Bona coffee) it was rather stuffy. First, there was a group playing ahead of us.  They were going to play for about 15 minutes, then the  real  show would begin.  It was horrid.  I mean, really horrid. I had to tell my friends that were there to dismiss the first group because Ryan's group was nothing like this.  Just to give you an idea of how deranged they were, first you couldn't hear the girl on vocals, second the guitarist was repetitive, third the third guy had a 20 key keyboard he kept trying to make weird sounds off of, and was throwing light bulbs into a box so they would break and make noise. He did this repeatedly with three lightbulbs, a cell phone, then finally dropped the entire box of lightbulbs.  However this missed the box and hit the floor because he wasn't looking where he was dropping, but was smiling at the crowd.  Not only that, be he had the oddest "hat." It looked like an oversized, confused pop corn kernel gone wrong.  And it was brown.  A second song they played was even worse...if that's possible.  The guitarist was playing, and the third guy was was running a power drill next to the pick-up just to make noise. Really hideous.  Then Something else started playing....yeah, that's the name of Ryan's band.  So when you're in the car and someone says ," Dude, put something else on."  You'll know what to do.  Yeah, i thought it was cheesy too, i had the great name of Acoustic Cappuchino, but no.  Anyway, throught that time i listened, talked, and surfed the web. Cause it's an internet cafe as well.  Some people from the birthday came too, because we invited them and Tim and I know just about all of them...which is why we were there... All in all, it was a good jam. We packed up, got some free stuff since I was with the band, and went home.             So that is the account of that Friday...i'll come back and post a bit later with the rest.
