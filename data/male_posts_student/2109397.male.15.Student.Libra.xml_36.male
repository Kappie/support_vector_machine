I told my parents that the U was actually a D but that didn't fase them from pulling out every punishment they could think of, and not to mention getting yet another lecture about how this is "unacceptable" and how much potential I have blah blah blah. So now I have to resort to the old we are going to sit down every day and go over everything you're learning and all your homework. Also I get to stay for tutoring every day it is possible for mathematics. I was like hell no but I dont really have a choice. My parents are so hypocritical as well. They are making me organize myself the way THEY want me to because my sytem obviously isnt working. SUCK MY DICK. This will probably be my last post for a little while, not like anyone actually reads this piece of shit.
