Played on an electric drum kit, did some piano practice, learnt how to use the tills, and did some trumpet duets with Ed, so that was cool. Oh, and did the Rimsky-Korsakov with the piano guy, Louis. He sight-read it O_O. Git. Played it better than Mr. T, too.  It's the summer concert tomorrow. My, is that going to be crap. None of the groups have practiced basically at all, so the only half decent things are going to be the solos, of which I'm doing 2. Phut. Dunno, all the fun's gone out of it, I wonder why... oh, that's it, yeah, I'm 4 grade standards above the music groups at school. Phut.  Almost to the stage where I'm counting down the hours to the tour. I mean, I won't be seeing everyone (not going to list them because people might get offended I didn't put their name first, even though it's probably obvious) for a couple of weeks (got the orchestra course straight after) but I'm spending a week completely with Meg and Ainsley and Bradley and peoples and it'll rule. I'm closer to Meg but I love Ainsley, she's brilliant. Hooray for Blackadder fans.  Quote of the day: "Said the shepherd boy to the mighty King, Do you know what I know? In your palace walls, mighty King, Do you know what I know?"  From Regency and Shane's   Do you Hear what I Hear?   Love, Jon Roskilly
