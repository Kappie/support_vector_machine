Did some maths revision in the library nd by the time I got to the exam I was confiedent with everything but quadratic equations and sine/cosine graphs. Which was half the paper. But 'cos it's so hard, ya only need 50% for a B :-)  Joes mam gave me a lift home, I came on MSN and had a sleep. Apparantly it thundered nd lightned, but that didn't wake me up. What woke me up was me dad throwin up, in the bathroom. Me mams ward was closed (she's a nurse) because of this virus, what she had last week, and now it seems she's passed it to me dad. Causes nausia, projectile vomiting, cramps and diahorrea. Lovely! 'Symptoms usually last from 24 hours to 3 days'. If I miss me exams because of this, 1: I kill both of them. 2: I can't get into the chem and phys courses nd shite that I want. Talk about timing :-(...  A rather uninteresting thing appened at me grandads. A smoke alarm was beeping, so I went to take the battery out the one in the front room. Then we heard it beep upstairs, so I went to take that one out instead. It wasn't that one. I took it out the one in the front room. It kept going (ya know, when the batteries runnin out), so I went back upstairs and took that one out. It kept going! Turns out it was the one in the passage. Me grandad nearly had a heart attack, laffin :-0!  Oh well, Tec exam tomorrow afternoon. Better revise on bitesize. I'm sick of all these exams, the past few weeks havn't exactly been thrilling. It's a load of toss. I've gotta revise the whole of geography tomorrow, for Thursday. Utter, toss.
