Michigan was fun, I think we should do three days instead of two more often. It feels considerably longer, though. It was the first time in a while that we had to set up in the dark. On saturday I spent the day with a drama troupe, met some interesting people. It was kinda spooky, how similar they were to our group. They even had the same idea of combining bagels and muffins, as well as a few other inside jokes at least half of you guys know about. If we can ever get clothes for you guys, I think it would be fun to start a drama group. It would be part of my plan to revive vaudeville! We could sing and do tricks as well as act, it would be great.    I am made of POISON!
