Well, I haven been motivated or haf tt motivation to play soccer yet. Dun think I will anyway, so I decided to play floor ball instead. Well, it was smt like ice hockey as well, the sport which I like watching. Tt's why I chose it over soccer. There were gers as well as some guys playin floor ball, at least half the class. It was fun, but tiring, as there weren't any outs. It was continuous all the way. I managed to bag home 2 goals for my team as well. I dunnoe who won in the end, but it was fun and the feelin of scoring a goal is definitely wonderful. Perharps tt's why I chose not to play soccer, as I rarely get a chance to even touch the ball. So heck bout soccer rite now, there's so many other sports out there!  During Basics, we were playin taboo, a kindda game tt uses words to describe the given word. No actions are allowed, juz explaination. Each team had to select a person each time to explain the given word. We had a minute to do as many words as we could. I didnt go up as I was basically slackin and giving lame answers. L0L! In the end, we still managed to win every1 else. Yay!!! Hehe.  After sch, I went to lunch wif lil' pig at the coffee shop opposite ginza. At first fat pussy cat was walkin to the bus stop wif us, but in the end, he didnt come along. I dun even noe why either, kindda disappointed cuz he didnt even tell me tt he wasn't going.  When I got home, I did some of my A Maths homework. I couldn't complete it as it was too tough and my mind wasn't on studies. I was tired and basically thinkin of other stuff. So I decided to go online and slack. Well, fat pussy cat was online and he started talkin wif me. He claimed tt I owed him bloody tonnes of things and tt he wasn't gonna let me escape. L0L! He said I owe him 2 lunch treats, $20 and 2 pairs of soccer boots. Wad a greedy fat pussy cat! L0L! Well, he still owed me my b'dae present and it's like already 4 mths, reachin 5mths soon. L0L! *Sighz* So mean of him, last yr I gave him a present too and he didnt even bothered to gif me 1. *Sighz* *sobz* *sobz* I hafta say I'm disappointed of cuz. Although he did ask me wad I wanted, I told him to gif me a surprise. Well, obviously he couldn't be bothered. I'm not surprised at all. *Sighz*  Hmmm, the fat pussy cat even threatened me if I didn't gif him wad he wanted. He claimed tt he was gonna do more things other den lifting me up. L0L! I haf no idea why he loves lifting and carrying me. He did tt after sch today as well. He wouldn't let me off till I agreed to let him lift me up. L0L! When he actually lifted me up, he refused to put me down. I had to struggle outta his firm grip. L0L! The good thing is tt I felt safe when he carried me. Usually I will feel insecure when ppl lift me off the ground and carry me around. I didnt feel tt way when the fat pussy cat lifted me up though. He had a firm grip and juz made me felt safe and secured. Well, tt's much more like brothers ya? Hehe.  He asked me if he wanted him to gif me some excitement. I told him to come on and gimme his best shot. B4 I knew it, my hse phone rang and it was none other than the fat pussy cat himself. I was shocked, I dunnoe how the hell he got my hse number. Now tt was some scary shitz! He even told me over the phone tt he would do more than juz lift me up tmr. We put down the phone and continued talkin online. This was wad we chat about.  Me: u guai lan wif me, u can 4get bout hafing anything at all. F.P.C: :( Me: AND if u do anything STUPID to me tmr u can oso 4get bout' it. Me: Muahahahha wah not bad, can use to my advantage. F.P.C: wad a GOOD brother, threaten me. Me: no la, it's call PEACE TREATY. F.P.C: its call unfair treatment. Me: u expect me everiday let u whack me lift me throw me sit on me do stupid things to me IZZIT!? (tt's realli wad he does to me everi single day without fail. L0L!) F.P.C where got stupid? its a way to express our brotherhood. muahahha all brothers do that got which brothers dun do that ar? Me: oh, brothers whack each other ar? lift each other ar? throw each other ar? sit on each other ar? F.P.C: yup. Me: well, tt's probably 1 of ur weird imagination.  Haha, hope he isnt mad at me or anything. He's still my bro and I dun mind him doing anything to me. I was juz joking wif him. Hehe, Peace! Cya all~ =]
