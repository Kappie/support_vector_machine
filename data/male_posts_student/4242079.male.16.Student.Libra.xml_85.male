It is not a very fun thing!   So, after 3 and a half weeks of bitching and complaining, Telus is finally sending a tecnician out to my house to hook up the god damned internet. I looked at it, and Mark looked at it. There is something wrong, and we tried to tell them that a long fucking time ago. All they kept saying is it can take 24-48 hours to work. They said that for roughly 336 hours before they decided to actually send someone out. Too bad they're sending him tomorrow, and it kind of interferes with my plans of not coming home tonight. Meh. There's always other nights to drink my worries away.  And damn all you anonymous commenters.
