Made a pot of beans later that evening, the cooked all night and are excellent. They taste alot like those ranch style beans this time. I'm kinda wondering what all that animal fat is for in the ranch-style beans becuase I made em with out all that and it tastes damn close. This morning, I went to this "college skills" lab at the JC. I think it will be helpful as far as getting me up to speed with algebra and all that again. Not much else. It felt like I was in school and that was kinda neat. I fill my life with little scribbles in my calender so I feel worth something. Stay busy all the time and you don't have the chance to see home meaningless it all is. I finished Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk, it was mediocre, but entertaining for the most part. Just started reading Imperium by Ryszard Kapuscinski. I am stoked about that book, so far so good. I also finished two paintings yesterday. I need to get my online gallery up. I've been thinking about that for a few days now.   Peace.   current mood:  pleased current music: murder city devils
