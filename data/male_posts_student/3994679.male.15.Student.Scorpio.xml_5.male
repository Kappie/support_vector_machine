Yeah, this guy was trying to cheat me in an AIM game, what a jack ass. And he changed his mind as to who he wanted to be once he realized I was of greater superstar value. Overall, if you're reading this, don't play AIM games, because they're gay and people cheat. Download apprentice, it's so much better and you can tell if you're opponent's cheating or not. Hell, I didn't even know if this Shivatra X jack ass had a Game deck built. No wonder his head exploded when I asked him what he overturned for Not Done with Any Flair...Clown shoes, man, clown shoes.
