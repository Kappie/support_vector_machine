No one answered it, so it just rang and rang and rang and rang, etc. But yeah. I just layed there hoping to fall asleep, but I didn't. So I stuck a cd in my cd player and just lay there listening to music. After about five or six songs I decided to just get up. So I did. Then Karen and Mrs. Donna left to go pick up Anthony at the airport because he flew in today. But it turned out that his plane didn't get here until late in the afternoon. But he made it. So that's good.  Oh, I finished my book today. The dirty worded one. Midway. It was pretty good overall, but the language really really bugged me. You can't read over that crap. You'll try to skip it and just run into it a couple of words later. I can say from imediate experience that the whole "you are what you watch, or read, etc." is very true. A couple of times I caught myself before I said something that I shouldn't. It's bad, I know very well. ugh. It makes me mad that I had to read that. I need something to clear my mind of all that filth.   Anyway. Today my computer (I say my computer. It's not really mine, but you know what I mean) locked up for absolutely no reason at all. Dad looks at something on the internet, closes the window, and the computer freezes. Then I called it a bloody piece of junk. It's not very nice, I know, but it frustrated me because I was trying to do stuff on it. It's so old. We really need to update it and our operating system. We still have Windows 98 for cryin' out loud. '98 was like, six or so years ago. That's a long time when it comes to computers. Well, I guess it works for now I guess. I can do what I want on it. At least we have a computer.   I played this weird game today. It was some online game called Rune Sword or Rune Search or Rune Somethin' or other. Like every peron on the screen was an actual person, except a handful of NPC's (that's Non-Player Character's for the un-informed as to what that meant). I walked around aimlessly. The quest I was supposed to do was confusing, and I had no clue where to go. I traded everything I had to this one guy cause I was really bored. Then I begged the surrounding people to kill me... no one did. So I just closed the window in utter boredom and got back online and talked to people and checkded my email like I always do.    Tonight was the TNT. Well, I'm not sure if was a TNT or just an areawide. It was hard to surmise. I heard it called both. Anyway. It wasn't anything special. I ate more than I usually do at things of that sort. That was weird. Oh, and there was this weird little girl that kept wanting to take people to "jail". She dragged me off (almost literally) to her place that she designated as jail where stood Chris and this other girl. After standing there for like, thirty seconds, I plotted a deversion and let the girl escape; and while the Jail-master Nazi-girl was quarreling with Chris, I made a run for it. Then after a couple of minutes she persued me and chase me around the house like, three times. whew. It was crazy. Then there was the devo... First, the singing wasn't up to par. I couldn't sing with Matt and Chris standing right behind me, and the speaker system was inadequate so we couldn't hear the song leader. Then the speaker gave a really long spill that involved alot of boats, water, and life-lines; I'm not too sure, my mind kinda wandered and my legs were about to fall off having to stand up the whole time. Afterwards we got on the buses and went back to the church. From there I drove Bon home, came back here, checked my email, IMed some people, wrote this, and listened to some music. I had better head out now. It's nearly 12:00 and I'm going to get up early to see Bonny off tomorrow. Blog to you guys later.
