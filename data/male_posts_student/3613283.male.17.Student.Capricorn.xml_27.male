Well, I was crossing  urlLink FNCC  today and one of the members - Cat - from the MSN group posted an interesting thread dealing with the raw document that she got on the  urlLink UN 's website. Look at page 13 and 14 for information on "dual-use sites".   urlLink PDF File: UNMOVIC report on WMD in Iraq
