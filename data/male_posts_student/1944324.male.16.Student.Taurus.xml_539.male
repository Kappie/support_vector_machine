Not Cool. Airing 232 minutes of Harry fucking Potter? Not cool. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MOVIE IS 152 MINUTES LONG! I'm absolutely not seeing the next crap-ass installment of this crap-ass movie franchise. I'm thrilled it made Fametracker's inessential movie list. Go screw yourself, Rowling!   The Swan:  Because it's wrong. And they replaced Wonderfalls with reruns of this misogynistic crap disguised as entertainment. Hell, all FOX reality is misogynistic crap.  And I'm spent. Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
