Agent Smith is amazing, and Keanu Reaves has actually found a movie where he doesn't suck horribly. Damn space time continuum..... I got royally reamed on my last test in AP History. In had an 83% in the class before the test. I now have a 78%. I have got to pull that grade up. There's no way in hell I'm getting a C in that class.  Sometimes I wonder what Life is about. Is life the love of another or a love for the world? Life is a walk in the woods, enjoying the creations of the world, and its natural beauty. Its a rolling mist that passes over a redwood forest in the early morning, one that obscures the man made confusion that causes the sight of what is, always has been, and always will be. Perhaps life is  poem written by a love one in the heat of the moment that reveals a peek into the writer's soul. Life is a kiss. A single moment that exists within a split second of time that stretches on into the infinitum that is memory. In the end the beauty is in the eye of the beholder.   Fate of a Blossom   Some flowers open to soak up  light. Some stay closed till late into the midnight. Love is a odd and fickle thing. One moment open, blazing like spring. The next recoiled and shuning the  warmth it once desired. Passion without love is an Oxygen deprived fire. Lotus blossoms forgotten in a loss of inhibitions trampled and destroyed in lustful transgressions. Only to be  raised from ash but never resurrected.
