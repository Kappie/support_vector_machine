When we got there we saw Dax Holdren and a bunch of other players practicin and what not. Only 4 teams played in the 18s bracket, including me and david...on our first match, we didn't do so well in the beginning. We were losing 13-18 until the player on the other team got injured, so the match had to b postponed. Our next match was against Andrew and Ric from S.B. High. We lost to them 21-19, 21-18...very close match i might say. Then we had to play against Chase and his partner(i forgot his name) also from S.B. High. We ended up beating them 21-19, 21-15...they made a lot of errors, and thats y we basically won the 2nd game. Then since the 1st match we played was postponed, and the guy that was injured is fine again, we had to restart that match and play it out again...we won the 1st game 21-19, then we lost the 2nd game 15-21...so we had to play a 3rd and final game...the sand was so freakin hot today, my feet are practically burnt. So then we won the 3rd game 15-12...and since we won that game, we got to play in the championship match against Andrew and Ric...and we played them right after we won against the other ppl...so me and dave were hella tired. So we ended up losing 11-21...and ended up with 2nd place and some awesome lookin trucker hats, which im coo wit...so overall, we played well and we had some good competition today aswell...so yeah...payce.
