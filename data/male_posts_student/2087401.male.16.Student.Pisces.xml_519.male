I got up at 10:43. I'm still wearing my pajamas. Smugness.  I have to agree with Michael in that there should be two youth groups. I'm personally not much of a youth group person in that I keep my religious things very private, and the whole "let's all hold hands and pray and quote Bible verses and sing songs with total strangers" thing kind of makes me uncomfortable. But I think it would be much better if there was a younger group who could do that, and an older group that could be more self-directed... like, we know the Bible stories already, what do we think about them? Plus, I really don't think Patty knows how to handle older kids. Especially not older kids like us. I started coming to the youth group to hang out with you guys, not be yelled at by this perpetually jumpy woman. So, all in all, I'm kind of glad it's pretty much over for me. Anyway.  The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.
