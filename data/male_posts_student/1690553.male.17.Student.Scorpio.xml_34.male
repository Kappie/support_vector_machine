Her mother recognized me and know that I am in Form 5 although I'm pretty sure I never met her before. That is quite odd as people usually can't guess my age properly when meet the first time. People usually got the impression that I am 2-3 years younger than I should - that is because of my slightly 'immature' face. Or they got the impression that I'm at least a college student, especially among IIUM lecturers and staff - mainly due to my profiency in English. ;-) My dad also looks younger than he should, often people tought that he is my brother when we went out together.
