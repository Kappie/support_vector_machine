I finally said it. I'm glad that I did, but I feel lost at the same time. It was kinda that hope that there was something there that occupied me for the last few months. I played out the scenario a million times in my head, each time knowing there really was nothing there, but keeping hope all the same. I didn't say all the things I wanted to say, but I said enough. And I'm glad of how it went. Honesty. I hope everything that was said was meant. I believe it was.  On the drive home I listened to the same song over and over. It felt right. It sounded how I felt inside. Not upbeat, not sad.... just peaceful. The roads were empty, it was cool, humid, the wind blowing into the car. Oh, goodness.  I wish I could just get over it. I feel so selfish.
