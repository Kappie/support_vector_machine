Then I did some paper editting and helped Inhye with her paper. Then it was 5 hrs of presentations. I'm sort of annoyed that certain people totally took advantage of the situation and talked over the alotted 15 minutes. I think that's just totally disrespectful to your classmates, because other people have to speak and people want to get home at a reasonably time. One guy talked for 30 minutes. That was just absurd.  After the presentation SeoKyung, Inhye, Shriya and I went to Olive Garden for dinner and then we hung out at my place drinking vodka. It was cool sitting around chatting / gossiping about school stuff.  I just did some packing. Tomorrow I need to go to the post office, campus, and clean. I got invited to go to the art history party. It's funny how involved in the art history department I am.  ***
