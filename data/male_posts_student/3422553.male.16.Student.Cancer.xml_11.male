I'd say it was a lot of fun, didn't learn too much, but I had a wonderful time.  Prank calling, dumping ice out beside people's doors and running away very quickly.  A lot of fun.  The camp took place on June 7th at 7:30 when we set off for Russilville.  The trip there was a lot of fun, we kinda got lost on the way and G saw us and kinda gave us a funny look as if we didn't know where we were going so on the way to the event while passing G I got a piece of paper from da bunny I wrote "We know where we are going" which was extremely funny at the time.  The food was great, meet new awesome people, had fun, what more can you ask for?  Well, perhaps it being free would of been extra cool but I didn't mind the costs.  You don't really have much say when you are a newbie to journalism, but I don't mind plus you gotta just get 'er done.  I just want to do the sports anyways they can do the rest for all I care.  Well that was the high light of my summer so I shall stay in my room for the rest of the summer now I suppose, I'll see you guys around town.
