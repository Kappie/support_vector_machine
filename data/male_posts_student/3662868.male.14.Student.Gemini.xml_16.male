Another persons emotions fucked with and another life turned to hell. Great. GOD I HATE MYSELF SOMETIMES! WHY DO I ALWAYS FUCK THINGS UP!? I'M SO FUCKING PISSED! There's nothing simple in life. Even the simplest seeming things can easily be complicated and turned into a mangled mess that gives people shit to deal with for a long time. I hate relationships. I love relationships. Fuck! FUCK!  FUCK!  I always hope that things can be simple and they seem so at first. BUT IT'S LATER THAT PROBLEMS HAPPEN! IT'S LATER THAT THINGS EXPLODE INTO ANGER, HATE, AND RAGE! SHIT THAT DOES NO ONE ANY FUCKING GOOD! I'M SORRY GOD DAMN IT! SORRY FOR EVERYTHING! SORRY FOR LIVING! SORRY FOR BEING BORN! SORRY FOR TAKING UP SPACE! SORRY FOR MESSING WITH PEOPLES LIVES! SORRY FOR CARING! SORRY FOR EVER LIKING AND GOING OUT WITH ANY GIRL! I'M SORRY! GOD DAMN IT!
