I might be dropping out of my summer school class and take it during the year. I don't know yet. So tonight, I spent the night mostly outside, except for watching the new show Summerland, which was actually pretty good. But then I just went out side and took a jog around my neighboorhood to clear my mind. Someone is posing as me on this. I have my thoughts that it's Brent Mercer so really he wouldn't be posing as me, just using my his name but acting like me. Which is really retarded. But whoever it is, they have no life to create a profile almost exactly like mine, and even a journal. Wow you take the time to actually do things like that. Get a freaking life you loser. You are just proving you have no life. But you think you're cool so keep doing it. I can just delete them. It's that easy. So everyone if someone posts as "brent" and it doesn't sound like me. It's not me, and the will be deleted when I come. Alright, Jay Leno is on. See-ya
