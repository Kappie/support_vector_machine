Is nothing special, but here it goes:   ....   As a beginning school is not to much different, but sure it is cozy. Ok, not cozy at all, but it keeps you a lot busy. Days pass, days come, and still everything looks the same... Thank God! I am a creature of habit.  At the moment, my only concern is that if I was an appliance, I would have returned myself... LOL!!! Anyway, I have the most nice schedule now... Also I'll be doing some work at the SRE. So I'll be quite busy, I'll be up from 7 am to 3 pm and then to school again in the afternoon. So far so good.  In other matters, Sarah's concert at the Sports Arena in San Diego will be on Monday July 12th ( as most of us knew ).... Now a friend of mine told me the tickets will be up for sale on February 9th ( That I did not know, so thanks Angel ). San Diego will be the fourth city she'll perform in the new tour... I just hope it'd be as good as Mirrorball.   For what is worth, I have my credit card ready to buy my ticket. I just want to hear  Ice cream  live and then I can sleep forever.  Now I want to write about something that makes me cringe: Why did I behave like a child when it came to Garcia Marquez? As I wrote in other post, this past vacation days I spent most of my time with my BIG nose in a book, several of them to be exact. I went from the tech-sci fi to Horror, not leaving mystery and fantasy novels. The list is large: Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Hannibal, The Iron Tower, Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes Compilation, Timeline, The Hobbit, The Da Vinci Code and the one I'll refer today. One Hundred Years of Solitude by Garcia Marquez is a wonderful story, a mix of reality and fantasy. Magical. Later I'll post something about it, for the moment just read it.   ....    Update : I'm expected to spent a whole week in San Diego prior to the concert, but I still don't have my tickets. I'll go on Monday to buy them I just hope I'll get good seats. Spring Break is SO near, I just want to get the hell out of here.
