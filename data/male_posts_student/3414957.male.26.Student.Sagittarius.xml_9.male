My math is done and all I have left is to read a story.....which I will do in the morning before class!    Just a weird observation. There are too many flakey people around today. Oh sure they will tell you all sorts of things but when its time to put up or shut, they shut up! I try to stand by my words no matter how hard it may be sometimes. When I tell someone I give them my word, thats like putting it in a vault and throwing away the key. Thats just the way I am. I dont know where I get it from, can't be my family, well maybe my uncle. Without your word, people will not trust you and then nobody will like you. Enough on that!   I really enjoy my new pc. I was watching a dvd, burning a cd, chatting online, using microsoft word, and surfing the internet with 4 tabs open on my Mozilla Firefox. The only thing I did notice was that buring a cd was the most comsuming (memory wise) but it wasnt too bad. Hats off to the dude who sold it to me and kudos to Paul for working his magic with the i386 file (wink wink)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   There is a guy I know, who at one time knocked a guy out because he said he was going to kick my ass. The guy was huge, it was in the military, he had an attitude and thought he could intimidate me with his size. He didn't because pain is temporary and I do not scare easily. I knew he wouldn't kill me so whats the worst he could do or stomach? Anyways, my friend Cosmo heard about it from another guy and walked down to this guys room, asked his roomates where he was, and then soon as he found him he clocked he so hard he went down like a ton of bricks. Cosmo is big, really big. Because I was such a good friend to him, he wanted to make sure nothing happedn to me. I didn't even ask him to do it, or require him to do it. I am sure I could have hurt this guy but that is the mark of a true friend.
