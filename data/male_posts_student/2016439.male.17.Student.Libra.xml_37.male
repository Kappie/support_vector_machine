I hate that question.  What if?  She'll be fine, right?  Things like that don't happen to my best friends, right?  Who can I talk to?  Alec's trying to find out where she's at, Emily doesn't know anything, Jenny has a show tonight, and Katie...WHERE IS SHE???  Car accidents can be fatal, but I'm sure it wasn't, right?  Sure, she's a reckless driver sometimes, but not bad enough to get herself seriously injured, right?  God, I hope she's okay.  Dear God, Lord, Jesus Christ, whoever's out there listening, she has to be okay.  Just because it happened to her, doesn't mean it'll happen to me...right?  I can't lose my best friends.  They're my rock, my foundation.  This is too much.  I hate it.  And still, I'm waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Philip
