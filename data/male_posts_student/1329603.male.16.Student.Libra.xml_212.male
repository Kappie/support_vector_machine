Dissapointed is an easy one to cover - Haven't done my revision yet and am currently blogging instead of doing it. Not that that stops me blogging instead. Self-control that has saved Charlton Kings' chocolate, wherefore art thou?  Irritated - MSN ISN'T BLOODY WORKING RAAAAAH. *whines* I wanted to talk to Lawa and peoples... mostly Lawa, cause we're getting on really well again now, not that we weren't getting on but we were getting on less well. Meeting up on Thursday, probably, yay! Apparently there's a "Jon sit" which I imagine would be "Jon situation" which I would  imagine  to mean whether or not it's set in stone... however, I cast no judgement, I don't know for certain. This is something I won't know for certain unless Lawa tells me, because I'm not asking. If she means is it set in stone, it is for me love, I'm not leaving until about 7.  Confused - Spent the day with N'omi, which was quite cool. What was odd is that we did basically nothing, we organised it really badly and ended up with me feeling quite guilty but just whooping her at Dead or Alive 2... there's a limited amount TO do here, though, apart from the PS2 and watching Blackadder. We did both, then went round CK looking for pictures of ourselves. We found quite a few. I look awful in the Les Mis photos. Really, really awful. I stand by my comment that I look best in photos if I'm dead. I don't look that bad in the one in which I'm shot and on the floor, but I look terrible in all the others. It's partly because my hair's a bad length (irritatingly face-covering but not long enough for a ponytail or anything), partly because I look like this *grins and makes people run away screaming* and partly because I'm one of the least photogenic people on God's green Earth.  Bored - Well, just... although it's been spent with N'omi, who is pretty cool and I can talk to easily enough, the day's been pretty dull. Was spent mostly trying to think of things to do.  We return briefly to Les Mis and the Marius + Cosette situation. Now, N'omi and I have worked out that the way we've been doing certain scenes is illogical, doesn't work with the words, and would be boring for the audience. We're going to have to try and work something out. Being romantic is hard. ACTING romantic is about 4 times as hard, especially when you've got to work out what you're singing at the same time. N'omi keeps saying that she'll kiss my cheek or something in the production; I haven't yet pointed out to her that if she's been to frightened to do it in the rehearsals it's unlikely, bordering on infinitely improbable, that she'll do it in the real thing. For me, I don't mind either way, but we need to look romantically linked which I think is something we're not acheiving. Perhaps the fact that we're now friends is a minus, because looking romantic at each other would, I fear, just make us burst out laughing. It's nice to know in a way. In a purely professional sense, it's a horror of horrors.  As we continue along the Les Mis route, I'm going to propose to Liv (notice the lack of a full stop there) that we don't even  try  to fit in the rest of A Little Fall of Rain. It'd be overly rude to the musicians to give them that short notice (I've done pit work and had it done to me, it's not only irritating but mind-numbingly difficult to work round) and it'd have to be worked through in a grand total of 2 rehearsals. Including the dress. So, unless she's willing to work out some time to meet up and run through it, I don't think it's a possible. Unfortunately. I love the song.  Oh, open mic thing yestertag was pretty cool, Shez and I did Livin' On a Prayer and Bohemian Like You. I personally did Imagine, Working Class Hero, and Mother. John Lennon fan over here.  Quote of the day: "As soon as you're born, they make you feel small, By giving you no time instead of it all, Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all."  From John Lennon's   Working Class Hero   Love, Jon Roskilly
