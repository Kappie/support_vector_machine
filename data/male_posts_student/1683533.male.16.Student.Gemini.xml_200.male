I dunno about you but using "pur"  (ie: that's puuuuurrfect)  in a sentence when the person saying it is related to a cat was used up for me the first or second time I heard it.  I have a feeling the only thing bringing sales to this movie would be Halle Berry dressed in a racy leather suit. And the sad thing is, it might work. If you are so interested in seeing Halle Berry nude, you might as well pick up   "Swordfish"   cause I guess she took off her top for that, so do yourself a favor and watch that instead of encouraging people to make more bad movies like this.  This really is a sad state of affairs. and I have reason to believe there are 10 or so different bands that have used that name (Sad State Of Affairs) as a song name. I see it alot. There should be some hardcore sueing going around...
