I'm never going to fall asleep early enough for that... To make tomorrow even more irritating, my brother is leaving for Japan, and I won't even get to see him off.  It's not -really- that big of a deal, but I won't be seeing him again till Christmas. And on top of all this, Hell Week starts Monday, so half of my last day of sanity and not feeling like a truck hit me, I get to go help old people carry bags of discount vegetables to their cars.   If anyone has any tips on falling asleep, please do share them with me.
