It tasted like spicy sausage, the meat was tough but how was I to know.  It was quite nice, but I'm not sure if I'd have it again.  We met a few of Sheldon's family this morning, they were quite friendly, and they gave us a little pack of playing cards, which had a picture of Texas on the back of each card, as a 'Welcome to Texas' gift.  It's poker time! lol  Mum, Sheldon and Ryan went to an International store while me and Daniel stayed at home.  I took some time to catch some rare Pokemon on my game while they took a crap journey to a store which didn't sell anything from England!  A total waste of time really :S  I nearly chucked up when I saw Sheldon covering two raw chickens with garlic salt, but that wasn't what made me queasy, it was the chicken's heart which was also salted up which nearly got me puking.  He was going to eat it! Eughhhhhhhh  We are going into town tomorrow for some sight seeing, and a few great photo oppertunities too so it will be awesome.  This post adds the 4th archive section onto my journal, making it here for nearly a month!  Might chill a bit before I hit the sack, nighty night.    P.S: I've change the title to 'Journal, Diary, Whadever' because that's how Americans pronounce their T's LOL
