Because of this, I don't need to worry about getting rides to places so things can happen more last minute. And that makes it fun. Plus I can drive myself home and not need to get rides from my parents. I just let them know when I get home. But I still have that pesky curfew of 11:00 PM. I wish I could get rid of it, but I can't. (Note: I can stay out later if I'm at a movie that starts late but I still can't get out of coming home directly after.)   Look, I've already started writing too much in this blog and soon its gonna get old. Please forgive me when I stop using this one too because I can't really commit to anything.   I have to go now because I can hear people screaming across the street which to me suggests drunken brawl so I'm gonna sit on the porch and listen. Until later - how much later, God only knows.   P.S. Some woman came to the door and I thought she had to do with the drunk people (who stopped making noise now) but she's just one of John's friend's mom.
