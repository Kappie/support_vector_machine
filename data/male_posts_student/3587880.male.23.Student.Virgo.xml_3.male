I set up an appointment to see my doctor for a medical, and worked a full day. When I got home I found my parents had done some checking into things so I knew all I needed to about health insurance and had a dentist appointment booked as well. All in all a good day.  Not too surprisingly I found myself on the Youth Encounter web site (if you're interested it's  urlLink  www  .youthencounter.org  ) today. I was looking around at some of the info about the bands from 2003-04 and started to wonder to myself "How would I feel if I were placed in the North central team?" There is a team in the North and South West, North and South central, central Great Lakes, Eastern Great Lakes, and North and South East. For as long as I've been thinking about doing this I've had a picture of being on the North East team, but what if I were placed on the North central team? It's just like home I'd imagine, flat dull, small towns and cities. Would I be disappointed? Would I develop a bad attitude about being there? Would I be jealous of those who were placed on the North East team?  To combat this I started reading one of the online journal entries from a member of the North central team. I didn't read too much, frankly I lost interest and there are times when I don't wonder if I don't have some sort of mild form of A.D.D., but I did read for a bit. What did strike me was that the person who was writing had a real joy about being there. She loved the people and didn't necessarily put too much emphasis on her physical surroundings. I was given pause to consider if I'd be able to do the same thing if I were in her shoes (because I might just be in a year). I think I need to spend some time asking God to give me a heart for the people that I'll encounter. I need to focus on them and not where ever I'll be posted. They're the real reason I'm going in the first place and He knows where I'll be used the most. I've got to trust that He's looking out for my best interests, that He'll teach me everything that He want me to know this year and that He'll arrange my posting so He can accomplish those two goals...Easier said than done though.
