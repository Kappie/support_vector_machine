I shall keep her identity anonymous.. Don't wanna everybody to know... Anyway.. I sms her this morning.. Sent her 'miss you' msgs.. And she missed me too.. We like each other.. And today.. I proposed to her to go on a relationship.. And she accepts... I love you baby.. You know who you are.. I promise to always make you happy... I'll try my best not to make you sad... Give all I had to make you smile.. Everything.. *mUaCkS*!! Hehehe!    School today was normal.. Except during recess... I accidentally rammed the soccer ball on Rayner's pelvis area.. It wasn't intentional! Sorry bro'! All was the same.. After school.. Marcus and me went to Rochor Centre.. or is it Road.. I forget!! :P Anyway.. Bought my D mechanisms... Cost around $35.. For just 2 items!! *sIgHzZ*!! Bought it and went for a stroll in Bugis Junction.. Drank something.. Check out comic shops.. Aand headed to Empress at Clementi for a movie.. Mas waits for us there.. We watched Alien VS Predator... The movie was like super-damn cool!!! I like the fighting scene between the Alien and Predator.. Hahaha!! I give the movie 4/5... Hehehe! That's for now...    Peace Out!!!
