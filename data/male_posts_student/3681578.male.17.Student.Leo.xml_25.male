I'll go through them one by one...  The Long Test in Math 21-Block A (AP) that is being taught by Dr. Jose A. Marasigan ang is now being handled temporarily by Ms. Aberin...  Um...it was not as bad as it ought to be...though I was not able to prepare for it much...  Well...it consisted of 7 questions plus 1 bonus item...the bonus item is time consuming and can be answered by moi in 30 minutes...the alloted time was 90 minutes...  I was able to go through all of the questions...1-7...1 being composed of 5 subitems where we had to compute for limits...it was nice...and the epsilon-delta proof part was not that bad, though according to David...my proof is wrong...anyway, I was able to answer all of them, though some of them were carelessly answered but as for the bigger picture...it was fine...  I thought my score was already merited me at least a D or a C, a C+ is not impossible though a B, B+ and A ARE impossible...I just think I am in the flip-flop because my solutions for all the items might not merit me full marks...I do hope it does and that he is lenient...  To get a D means to get at least 50 points out of the 100 total points...I wasn't able to use the proper solution for the bonus item because I only had 20 more minutes to answer it...literally, the time was inadequate to complete all test items...at least bonus lang yung na-miss ko...anyway, I made up shorter solution for the bonus item that will yield a different result pero that was the only way I could answer it without making up all sorts of number...I had to derive din the half-angle formulas pa...since I already forgot them...  So yun...so much for my long test...lets go to the more tragic Lit 13 quiz...
