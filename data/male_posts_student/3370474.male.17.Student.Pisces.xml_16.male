You have broken me in many pieces.  You can never make me stay.  I must leave these tears behind, but the pain we inflict upon each other. Iâ€¦ we need it; we crave it.  How can I live in a world of hatred without my one true love by my side?   Death, oh holy goddess of all whom are damned, lead me to my grave.
