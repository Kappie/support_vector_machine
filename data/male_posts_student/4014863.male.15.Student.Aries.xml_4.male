For those who were looking forward to me updating i'm sorry... i officially say only certain people i'll answer to what i've done or anything like that, the people i think i'll let ask, are Brianna if she cares to know, or Geoffrey if it actually won't hurt him to hear it. My diary entries are kinda sad i think that i actually loved her, I hate anyone who thinks i'm too young to love. There is so much i want to tell her but i lack the words. She is the first person I could close my eyes and see not even family can i picture as crystalline in my mind. I'll wait for that someday... that infinite tommorrow, that I may one day hold her in my arms and she would share the same sentiment. I feel so impure, digging up long buried secrets, that none but her and I now know. If you are reading this don't tell her about it not even a breath. I still wish to sing her the song that i can't listen to without thinking of her. Only the above may ask what song that is... though my song for now is "this time imperfect" by AFI. that's all i can truly say. *signing off*     -Ty
