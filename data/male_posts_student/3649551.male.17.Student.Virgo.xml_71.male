I broke it in by downloading an entire cd - Emery. It's some strange blend of hardcore and emo that some refer to as 'Screamo.' Got that suggestion from Krispin the Poet, or Krispin the Emo Kid, whichever you prefer. Shasta was a great experience. It felt like a lot smaller group this year and I liked it better that way. The temperature never got unbearably hot,  much  unlike last year. I got some reading done, too. I finally finished  1984 , which is so depressing and hopeless that it inspires hope in the reader. Very cautionary story. Anyway, I'm also reading  The Case for Faith  by Lee Strobel, and I highly recommend it. It addresses some of the toughest objections to Christianity (for example, how can God be good if he tortures people in hell?) in the form of interviews with different 'specialists' on the varying subjects. A lot of people turn their noses up at books like  The Case for Faith  simply because they think it's Christian propaganda - some one-sided, cheap, manipulative advertisement for Christianity. Well, it ain't that at all. The author's role in the interviews is to bring up the best arguments against God, basically, and force the person to refute them. It's good stuff and most people (non-Christians included) could really enjoy it. As a matter of fact, I think it's a perfect book for anybody who has heard what Christianity is about and isn't so sure about it. Speaking of Christianity and books, I'm trying to obtain a really cool translation of the Bible called  The Message . It's written in a very modern and informal style and is infinitely more interesting to read than  NIV . It really gets the sarcasm across. I'm serious - especially in the New Testament, things are very sarcastic. Here's James 1:26-27.   Anyone who sets himself up as "religious" by talking a good game is self-deceived. This kind of religion is hot air and only hot air. Real religion, the kind that passes muster before God the Father, is this: Reach out to the homeless and loveless in their plight, and guard against corruption from the godless world.     I just grabbed that at random from  urlLink http://www.biblegateway.com/ , but you get the idea. I love seeing phrases like 'talking a good game' and 'only hot air' in the Bible. But think about it: the New Testament in particular was written in a simple style meant to be understood by the average person of that time period. It wasn't meant to be fancy or formal, but personal and convicting and in-your-face. I can't wait to get my hands on  The Message  in the form of an actual Bible. Reading online just isn't as satisfying as holding a book in your hands.
