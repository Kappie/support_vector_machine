We got a couple grocery bags and went from dorm to dorm in the quad and found food in kitchens and in lounges that people just left behind.  Cindy had already looked through several buildings since she's working in the quad as a mechanic this Summer, but there was plenty of stuff left for the both of us.  Gilbert and Hoeing were the big stashes, the others not so much.  I came home with 3 bags of food and a three tier shelf table.  It's a nice end table and should fit into the new apartment nicely.  Now just to find matching furniture, right?  We then promptly went out to taco bell.  Cindy had a craving as she put it.  Had a couple bean burritos.  Went to walmart to pick up the film, but it won't be ready until Friday.  I guess we'll go back Friday.  Hey, I heard on the radio that Darien Lake is having Mardi Gras weekend a week from this weekend.  Should be fun, we should go.
