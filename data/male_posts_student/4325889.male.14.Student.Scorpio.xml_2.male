Job Level is each job class level after Novice level 9. Every time your Job level goes up, you can get one skill point. The Gauge bar beside each Level Stands for your Experience % which you've gained so far. If it's full by 100%, the character gets one level up then the Gauge Bar will reset to 0% again for the next level up. Weight stands for 'the Present weight / Maximum weight ' that your character is carrying. When the present weight is over than 50% of maximum weight, It will be shown in Red colour. From that moment , It is impossible to regenerate HP/SP Naturally. Or when the present weight is over than 90%, The character wonâ€™t be able to attack any monsters. You'd better store the excess items in Kafra's warehouse if you don't want to be killed by monsters without even the chance to fight back. For reference, the Basic Information Window is never wiped out and always remains as a Smallest window.
