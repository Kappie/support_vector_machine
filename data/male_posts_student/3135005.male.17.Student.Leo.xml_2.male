But of coarse at a sacrifice... And i still can't figure out an animal name for myself! Damn. All the really good ones are taken :'( I wish I could have slept for longer this morning! A good long sleep would have done me good. And at lunch i had this taco salad, and oooo i dont feel good -_-. And I just found something out that will help me so much. You can look or do anything on these scholl computers. as long as it isn't a website name that is illegal im aight. So now i can play some online games or somethin. as long as it isn't blocked, but i aight got much use for that so thats aight, i have a whole lotta other stuff to do on the computer.
