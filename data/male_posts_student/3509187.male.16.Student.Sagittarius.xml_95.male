One of the radio stations asked me a few questions and then asked if they could use some Tape... I accually had a total of 5 people ask to use some tape... If nothing else, I helped 5 people today.  I am still accepting orders for duck tape use-ables.  If you want to order something just email me at Danvalenza21@hotmail.com.  Tell me what it is you want, colors, discription, and how much you'd pay for it. I'll email you back to discuss your order.  After Arts Fest, I went to Untitled practice... Wow we ROCK...  We're working on some songs right now, and have almost 2 completely done... No lyrics cause our singer quit... Do you know a singer who likes a ton of kinds of music and can write lyrics? Please Let Me Know...  By the Way the bass I have a picture of on this Blog is sold sorry to anyone who wanted to buy it...  Whoo Arizona!  Hmm well thats about it for now... I'll probly think of something else, but for now good bye...  -Dan V
