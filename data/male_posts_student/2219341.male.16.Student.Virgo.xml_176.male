((i have moved on very well...WINK WINK! LOL!))  i dont have to be upset.  i know it will be ok.  so i didnt get what i wanted...its ok.  maybe what i wanted wasnt right for me.  you dont have to wait for me.  i understand.  but i will still be here, as i always have been, for when you need a friend.  goodnight, dearest friend.
