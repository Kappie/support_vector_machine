Currently we have a lead guitar, lead base, drums, and a techno-specialist. Guess which one is my position. So now all we need is a recording studio (probably a basement). The key thing we are missing are lead and backup vocals. We REALLY need vocals. So far, we have one maybe two vocalist. Our base player's g/f will possibly sing back-up, and I will probably sing lead along with being the techno-specialist.  So currently we are looking for singers in our school. I'll keep you updated, and I will post the site address of our band's site once we actually make some music. Anyways, that is all I have for now.   later, bradleyJ
