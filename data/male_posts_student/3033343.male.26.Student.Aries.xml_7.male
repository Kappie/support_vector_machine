I'm an ATTWS subscriber.   A friend of ours is in Kingdom Hospital ( urlLink pictured here, on the left ), which will start airing next week at 8pm on Thursdays, instead of its former 10pm Wednesday time.  A good move, perhaps, in that more people watch television on Thursdays, but they're putting it against CBS's  CSI: Crime Scene Investigation  and NBC's  The Apprentice .  Not a good move.  This was to be ABC'S ratings cash cow, having such a prosaic season.  It's a shame to move such a good miniseries into the ratings guillotine.   OPEC is trying to screw us again with a  urlLink 4% cut in crude oil production .  Good plan, we're already bleeding, why not open the wound.  Is this proof enough that the war  maybe  wasn't about oil?  Democrats, that's your cue.   The smoking ban in Connecticut begins today.  I was the last to smoke a cig in the bar last night, beaming with pride and internally weeping at another lost freedom.  Will it hold?  I'll watch the stats.   Get your drugs from Canada!  New Hampshire Governor  urlLink Craig Benson does .   3 1/2 to 7 years for sending out  urlLink 825 million bulk emails.   Connecticut law, which is the most severe when compared to Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New York (most lenient), gives up to  urlLink seven years for possession of a narcotic (heroin, crack, cocaine) .  I'd be curious to see if a casual drug dealer makes more than a bulk emailer.
