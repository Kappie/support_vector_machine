Tomorrow (June 27th 2004) is the date that marks the 6th month of our relationship! That's half a year! And the time has just flown by! I suppose that's what time does when you have fun. I don't know what is it that has stopped me from becoming bored like I have done with my past relationships! There's something really insatiable about my Mandy-Laila! She's just so fun to be around. When she isn't here, I feel odd... like something is missing.  Yeah, I take her for granted sometimes (well a lot of the time...), but who doesn't take someone they love for granted? Or is that a stupid question that only refers to me? But, the thought of not being with her brings me to tears. I think I have cried more these 6 months than I have in the rest of my life. I don't know why on earth she is with me... she can do so much better. I am way too paranoid and way too aggressive. One thing I seriously regret happened about 2 weeks ago. I was really tired (and stressy) and Mandy and I were just going to bed, and for no reason AT ALL I started being really mean to her. I turned the light off, got into bed and hugged her. Then I started to cry. I just couldn't believe I could be like that with her. I have got such a short temper! And I know that 99.9% of the people to read this will agree. But, believe me or not, it has calmed down so much since I met her. Never before have I wanted to change for a person. I want to be what she needs and I seriously intend to be, because I love her, and when we are together, I get lost in time and nothing else matters.
