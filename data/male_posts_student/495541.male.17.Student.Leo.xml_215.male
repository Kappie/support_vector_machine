I didn't feel good at all.  But I decided that I should go to school anyways because I don't want to miss anything this early into the year.  So I toughed it out... even though it probably wasn't that bad compared to I don't know what... but I was probably just being a wimp by other people's standards.  I still feel pretty crappy.  Sore throat and a cold like no other.  I feel pretty hot down here.  I don't know if it's just me or it really is hot down here.  I'm going to go get a fan.  The fan makes my computer screen flicker.  Fun.  I moved it but now it's ok.  When I update this thing with my every move... I make it sound boring and the way a lot of people write their blog.  It's annoying.  Anyways though I forgot what I was talking about so I'm going to just end it right there.  Incubus - Wish You Were Here  -19615.77 -1940.76
