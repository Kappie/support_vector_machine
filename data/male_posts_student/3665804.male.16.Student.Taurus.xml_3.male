I, for the first time, had a dream about one of my stories, The Second Ninja.  I was the main character, Ni, who is a girl.  That isn't much of a change from myself as some of you may know... heh...  Well, I need to go clean and pack for my trip.  But one can never be to old for an imaginary friend, especially if they're random, here's Inariko, Leader of the Trideity.  Inariko: I shot a cow yesterday, it tastes like chicken.  Or is it the chicken that tastes like cow.  Actually it was a moose.  Remember kid, you don't eat macaroni through your nose, it doesn't work. Zeeky Boogy Doog! *explodes*
