This person is intelligent enough that I would have thought they would have realized I was intelligent enough to know that they were lying.  Trust=broken.  Also, in other news, today was the day.  Everyday for the past two weeks, those who know me well have been betting on when my mania would end.  Usually it lasts for 1-6 days followed by a long pessimistic depression.  Today, the glass ceiling shattered.  The floor went out too.  I really am upset and it all started with one comment I heard from someone I would not expect to hear it from.  Hopefully, the happy thoughts come back quickly and stay for a long time.  Until then, the glass is not even half-empty.
