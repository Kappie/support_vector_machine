Beer pong is a fun game to watch.  Bad Fish, despite being a tribute to Sublime, does one hell of a show. Great concert. Even though the people I was with ditched me. Still a damn good show. Found other people. Just because theres a bouncer and the place says 18+ and that they check id doesn't mean that they do. They only really do that in the 21+ section - and sneaking past the guy between the sections is remarkably easy.  I need to sleep, and study the hell out of tomorrow. And then see Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Gonna be great.
