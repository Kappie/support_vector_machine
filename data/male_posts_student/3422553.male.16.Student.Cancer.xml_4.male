The college world series is a huge event to all college baseball fans.  Everyone gets to "roll out" to Omaha Nebraska to watch his or her team compete for the championship if their team was fortunate enough to make it into the 64 team tournament.  The tournament is like march madness and the NCAA bracket, but when they narrow it down to 8 teams, it becomes double elimination.       Nonetheless, the hogs made it to become one of the eight teams in the finals.  They matched up against number one Texas.  Texas is a favorite to win the whole thing, and we lost badly 13-2.  So we drop down to the losers bracket and play Arizona tomorrow, Father's day.  The hogs haven't been to the CWS in 15 years so tune in Sunday at 1 ESPN to root on our hogs, we'll need the support.
