Schools starting and I am only enrolled in 12 hours.  Needless to say I am pretty excited to be going back.  Sharpen my skills, warm up the brain farm, and shit like that.  It's funny that I am excited to go back.  I bet I'll be hating it in a month.  Oh Well.  This was a stupid post which served as a shameless promotion for Singha.  Stay tuned for a post that actually matters.
