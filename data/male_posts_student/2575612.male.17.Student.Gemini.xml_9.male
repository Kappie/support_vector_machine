Only in my imagination, Only in my dreams, Where my real life teems, For what could be, For what i might see, This and this place alone, Is where i feel known.  My heart skips a beat, Thinking about future feats, Where we discover ourselves, Find truth, make right,  and best of all: feel true love.  What doesnt include this theme, love? it is everywhere. not just the boyfriend and girlfriend relationships, it is the cornerstone of everything that works in this world. parents and family, friends and companions. Everyone requires love. love isnt to be taken advantage of. if we can go through life and not have one  person that you would lay down your life for because you love them THAT much...what have we accomplished? nothing.
