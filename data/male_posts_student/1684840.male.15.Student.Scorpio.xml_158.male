I spent most of the rest of the day browsing and planning what to do with my money when I get it.  The bids on eBay did great!  All three items reached a grand total of £75.50!  I now have over £130, plus I am babysitting tomorrow too!  I don't know what is happening, money seems to be flooding in from all directions...
