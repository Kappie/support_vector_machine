The Goat is the only political commentator who eats press releases and newspapers before digesting them and then proffereing his own opinions on to the electorate.  It is a little known fact that the Goat has studied politics once but thought better of it when given a distinction on an essay along with the comment: "Your ideas are interesting but wrong and stop trying to eat my toupee."  The Goat has asked me to write down his political bleatings for the enlightenment of the masses.  Stay tuned to the mojo wire hacks...
