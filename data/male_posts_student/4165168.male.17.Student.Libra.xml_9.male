Jasmine,just want u to know that i miss u very very much n i love u deeply although from the surface,i might be acting as if there's nothing.but deep down inside,i love u deeply n miss u very much.My tears are actually flowing down non stop right now while writing this blog.it's flowing more n more drasticly. Man,it's so painful.i really cannot take the pain man.Huhhhh.......i think that's all for 2day ler,i'm really tired.so so tired.not those sleepy tired but those painful tiredness.take care peeps...chaoz~!
