MiMi and I cleaned up the apartment a bit on wednesday and went for a drive to look for apartments. We ended up somewhere near the coast in a small town called Dillan Beach. Lots of surfing there. Two weeks ago a guy was attacked by a great white while surfing at that beach.  From there we made our way down PCH along the Tomales Bay. We passed through this tiny town, Marshall. It must have been a fishing community becuase we passed by a few fishing type fellows. They had their warm sweater caps and dirty rubber overalls. Probably milling over ex-wives as they threw a few Bud Lights back around the bed of a ford ranger.  When we reached the end of the bay we made our way up the otherside, our destination being Point Reyes National Seashore. Sir Francis Drake Bay was in the park as well as some 20 ft. waves crashing down on the south side of the shore. I was mystified by the shear power of these waves. The air was full of saltly mist. Things were washed up on the beach that resembled some sort of snake/bull whip/plant life. It had roots and felt like a sponge. Funny.  We had an awesome, and quick drive back to 101. We took the Petaluma-Point Reyes Blvd. and found some beautiful hills lit with green grass as bright as neon. I forget what we did after that. I believe we rented the Fellowship of the Rings extended version and watched that.  Thursday, mimi and I went through some of our pictures and found them homes in empty photo albums. Finally. Cleaned the casa more. Mimi went to work at 4:30 - I went christmas shopping and was surprised by the snow on all the hills the hug the highway. just 10 minutes up the road, the hills were covered in snow. It was very cold that day. I was filled with energy, just wished there weren't so many damn people some times. Always rushing around.  I am really itching for a motorcycle. I want something to ride, and soon. But with this rain, I really don't have the chance too. Summer is a love/hate kinda thing, mostly hate.  Right now, mimi is at the tori amos concert. I am drooling over Henry Rollins on Jan. 8th. He will be in Dallas in Feb so check that out. I skipped out on the show since leatha was wanting to go, fine with me.   current mood: artistic current music: John Coltrane - I'm Old Fashioned
