You see, this morning I was getting really mad about people who do nothing with their lives.  Life is about more than having sex and kids and playing bridge and bingo, all you crazy people out there!  If you're in a bad situation I understand, but if you have no ambition to be better and do something then find a way to buy a gun with food stamps and just.... sorry, got a little mad.  Anyways, I get really mad when people don't live life the way God made them to live it.  As in, guys who say, "Oh yeah, me and my girlfriend live together but we're gonna get married when we have enough money to pay for the wedding."  I hate it when people can't wait till they're 65 so they can play golf all day long.  Lately I've liked the Jet song "Roll Over DJ."  I love last verse which is like, "so you think you're a star/ but a pill-poppin' juke box is all that you are/ tell me it ain't that way/ what's your name?
