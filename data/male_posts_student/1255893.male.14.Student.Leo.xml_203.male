Everything would be great if I could use more space for it, but short, sweet, and to the point would be a bit more tasteful. I guess the problem is I don't know what I want. Maybe I should go figure that out before I make any drastic changes.   Then again, I think my original title (the one I've kept longest) has suited me better than I've given it credit for. The ony thing that's changed is the pretext behind it. So rather than the crap I see... it's the sporadic breaks in my boring routine.
