While I was skimming through my reviews to find out what happened to them, I noticed they made my   The Last Samurai   review a spotlight review. This is going the right way: first Johnny Cash, now Hans Zimmer.          Unfortunatly, the spotlight has swerved away from Johnny Cash in the meanwhile. I don’t weep, because after all, it did reap 230 helpful votes.            Hans Zimmer - The Last Samurai review:       urlLink  http://tinyurl.com/68cbr                 I use Amazon reviewing to practice my writing skills and to see if anyone actually reads what I write. Thus far, I am not at all dissappointed. In fact, I think I should write reviews with a higher frequency.
