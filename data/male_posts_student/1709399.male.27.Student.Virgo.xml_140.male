I stepped out of the car  found this 7 year old girl who was looking at me with curiosity. I took out a frock to give to her but realised it was too small for her. She cutely went inside the Hut and brought a 3 year old to whom the frock was an exact fit. I asked her what her name was  she said Gori. Gori was not even expecting another piece of frock from me nor was she sad that the earlier frock didn't fit her. I was moved by her Magnanimity ( Beacuse a few minutes earlier at another place people were litreally plucking from our hands clothes of all sizes irrespective of whether it fits them or not) . I offered her a bigger frock and she became so happy that she put it on immediately and started Dancing . I have taken a nice photo of it and the sheer joy on her face was unparalleled. I learnt a valuable lesson : Great people not necessarily need to be rich or educated or aged.
