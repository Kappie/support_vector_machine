The (Leering) Uncle type    Can be spotted more often in:    Older pubs with (cheesy) revamped decor and tons of cheap beer.    Pubs or karaoke lounges that play (cheesy) retro music and have lots of young ladies.     Telltale signs:    May be balding or look like they've just gone for hair-weaving treatment.    May don a couple of gold chains or bracelets, thick gold watches or fat rings.    Often pay by cash (wouldn't want the wives to know where they've been from credit card bills).    Can't keep their eyes off the girls gyrating on the dance floor.    Old enough to be the father of the young ladies.      The (Rich Kid) Yuppie type    Can be spotted more often in:    Trendy or spanking new pubs.    Special premieres or exclusive events at clubs.     Telltale signs:    Short spunky hairstyle, well-gelled.    In office outfit, tie still on, albeit loosened.    Flashy smiles and heavily scented with cologne.    May be accompanied by a flashy vehicle or model-like girl companion.    Often pays by credit card.      The (Desperate) National Service Male type     Can be spotted more often in:     Watering holes along Mohamed Sultan Road and Boat Quay, especially during happy hours or ladies' nights.      Telltale signs:     Short shaven hair.    Very tanned faces, sometimes with acne.    Usually with his camp mates.    Often drinking too much, too quickly.    Often needing Dutch courage to approach girls (related to above point).    Overtly drooling over girls gyrating on the dance floor.       Written by Candice Lim
