Well, I thought they were fucking awesome, but everyone else said they were crap. So, I remade them again and again, and then another time and finally came up with some good ones.  For some reason Ian and Michelle's characters are the hardest to make. I keep going back to them trying to perfect them to what they actually look like. It is hard, there is something about those two that makes it difficult to put onto paper. Abby, Adam, and I were easy ones to make. I knew exactly what to do with each one.  In a couple days we are going to start doing different things on this website, so get ready for some fun. None of the yelling that occurs on Kakutama +3.
