I can't stop thinking about it, I hope she gets fine soon and life can get back to normal, right now its so hard to even concentrate. I would like to thank a very special friend who, encouraged me that my mum would be fine, and that I wouldn't have to worry too much. Thank you with all my heart, i'll remember your birthday for sure!   RO Thoughts Today  Well, ain't nothing much to write on, just a quick tip before I logoff to do my homework (yeah some leftovers).   Tanking  Knights are good tankers, if they are used correctly, but Crusaders are better tankers overall as they have more defensive skills and more HP to accomodate their already enhanced defense. The only way to tank well however, is to either get a priest to support you, or get those sickening hard to get cards for shields. The -30% Damage really helps when you're tanking cuz every HP counts, especially for a knight as the only way they can completely avoid an attack is either dodging it or using Auto-Counter. How do knights use shields? Use a +10 4s Pike, slot it with cards and there, use a shield on the other hand. Unknown to many RO players, there are actually 1 handed spears, most of which aren't really powerful, but the pike is an exception at +10 with really freaky cards (there's a reason Gravity made this weapon ya know). Overall, the Crusader is a better tanker than the knight, but the knight is more offensive based. Aha, did I miss out another class that tanks well? Of course! The assassin! These buggers save the team when the knights and crusaders are knocked out at the front of a battle especially when facing strong mobs. Perfect dodge sins are really nimble flies, they can dodge just about anything, with a priest supporting their tanking is superb, most of the time even outdoing the knight or crusader. Take note however, the perfect dodge sin has horribly weak attacks and hardly any skills to accompany him in his journey. Then again, he makes up for it with his mad dodging.
