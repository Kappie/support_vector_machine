Tai Wu didn’t opposed at all, he hadn’t truly communicate with a local and to say…a wide-eyed girl with adorable face.  Karean, “All right…we can talk now… What’s your name by the way?”  Tai Wu, “Tai…Tai…Tai Wu…” he murmured slightly.  Karean, “Ok, Tai Wu… I have some questions to ask you. What is the current date in this world?”  Tai Wu thought, “Huh?!… why did she ask me this question? Damn, I have to think of something…”  Although looking rather dumb, Tai Wu is quick in his thinking and he answered, “In actual fact, I’ve just woke up from a deep coma and now searching for the people who left me at the Southern village.”  Karean heard the answer and looked rather skeptical at it, “Is that true?”  Tai Wu, “Why should I bluff you?”  Karean, “Okie…What is the biggest power now in this world?”  Tai Wu was bewildered now, why would a girl of this world ask him such questions, “What do you really want to know from asking me all this?”  Karean, “Just tell me, do you know the answers?”  Tai Wu, “…alright alright…I admit, I don’t know the answers.”  Karean, “Ok, one last question. What time are you from?” she said with a slight smile, as if happy at hearing Tai Wu’s ignorance of this world and the last question is like a joke.  Tai Wu, “…Ancient China, from Cheng Du. Happy?”  Hearing this, Karean jumps up with joy to the complete baffled Tai Wu. He stood there, gleaming on.   Karean, “Haha, I finally found one!! Finally!”  Tai Wu, “Huh?”  Karean stopped her short celebration, lifted her hands for a handshake, but Tai Wu unknowing of this ‘action’ stood there with that confused look on his face. (Tai Wu’s from Ancient China whereby there is no cultures as handshakes.)  Karean, “Oh yeah, I forgot you’re from Ancient China…This is called a handshake, similar to a bow.” Saying that, she went on and did the handshake. “Understand now?”  Tai Wu, “…ok, you believe about the ‘Ancient China’ thing?”  Karean, “Hah, of course…I’m from another world and time frame as well.”  Tai Wu, “What?!”  Karean, “Quiet down, nobody can hear about this…How bout this, we’ll head for my place here…I’ll explain all about it.”  Tai Wu, “You sure it’s alright? How can I enter your room…”  Karean, “Are people in the past so shy? Just listen to me and don’t worry.”   With that, she started leading Tai Wu deeper into the forest until almost no light can past through the canopy above. Reaching a clearing, they stopped.   Karean, “Now remember this route, it’ll be equivalent to your house’s route.”  Tai Wu, “I’ll be staying in your house?”  Karean, “Hah, no dummy…this is all too long to explain. Just keep quiet for now.”  She bends down and swept away several dead leave and grass, eventually revealing a small hook. Sweeping more away, it showed a large hatch with three relatively rusty ring in a line.   Karean, “Now…here’s the hard part.” Then, she draws out the two kodachi hidden in her boots.  Tai Wu, “What are you going to do with those?”  Karean, “Hehehe, Magic.”  Holding the two swords and setting it up high, she sets her left hand over the other, making the Twin Kodachi in her hands set above the other as well. Soon after, Karean began chanting an unknown phrase. Amazingly, the Twin Kodachi began reacting, they began to glow and eventually into blinding light, now the Kodachi is like a light beam…totally harmless. Next, Karean places her right fist over the left, merging both beams of light. After a short period of time, the blinding glow stopped, replacing in its place is an ultra long, twin and sharp sword.  Tai Wu, “Your sword is…Astonishing…”  Karean, “Haha, thank you. I’ve just learn of how to harness the power of my Earth weapon “Creator”. You learned of yours?”  Tai Wu, “Huh? This sword?” He starts flinging his sword onto the ground. “Nope, I still haven’t even started using this sword until previously.”  Karean, “Hmm…alright. But you better learn of how to develop the power of your sword. Ok, lets continue.”  Carrying the newly formed long sword, she slots Creator into the line of rings. With just an easy flick, she easily cuts open the rings, which lead to the open of the hatch. After opening the hatch, Karean once again draws out the slotted sword and in an instant…changed back to the Twin Kodachi.  Tai Wu, “Your sword can change form?”  Karean, “I’m not sure whether it can, but the long sword form is what I’ve discovered. It’s original form is still the Twin Kodachi. To open the hatch, you have to open the rings within it, bashing it from the surface can’t help at all. Alright, lets head in, my room is just at the end of this cave.”  Keeping the Kodachi, Karean jumps into the dark hole below. Tai Wu hesitated a little before following into the hole. They began traveling through a long series of darkness and creepiness before reaching an enormous door with a strange and out of place scarecrow standing beside it..   Karean, “Alright, my room is here.”  Tai Wu, “You need such a big door?”  Karean, “Oh, I’m supposed to be sealed off from the rest of the world and totally focusing on my form of Martial Arts ‘Sen Arashi’. I don’t like this way of life so I found of a way to run. Ok, stop all these questions…I’ll open the door.”  Karean bent down a little, holding one of the Kodachi with the right arm raised perpendicular and the forearm ninety degree as well, left hand however is totally stretched straight.  Tai Wu, “Why this position?”  Karean, “…”  Seeing Karean is actually serious, Tai Wu quiet down…He knows that Karean is going to show her skills now.  Karean takes in one deep breathe… “Sen-Arashi! Dai Kai Sen!”
