Say, "Oh God, save my soul.  I'm so sorry that I have  sinned against you, but I have come home.  I will  serve you, Lord, the rest of my life.  Deliver me  from all my sinful habits.  Set me free!  I do believe Jesus died on Calvary for me, and I believe in His  blood, that there is power in His blood to wash away  all my sins, all my sins!"  Say, "Come into my heart,  Jesus; come on in, Jesus.  Come on in!"  If you meant it, He has come.  If you meant it,  Jesus is yours.  Start reading your Bible, pray daily  and believe that somebody's listening; His name is  Jesus.             careful at cain oreven statue as in disquisition.
