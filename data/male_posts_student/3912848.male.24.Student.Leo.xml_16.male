Nothing in this constitution shall be construed to require that marriage or its benefits be extended to any other union than that of a man and a woman."   This language will most certainly be the alternative that most Dems and squeamish Reps will turn to.  While I like the idea of federalism and state sovereignty on issues that pertain to the family, I also believe the Union was conceived in the first place in order to achieve a degree of uniformity on issues where divergence among the fifty states' laws would work more ill than good.  Imagine the effect of 50 differing definitions of marriage in our highly mobile society.  Those that are married would be discouraged from relocating to other locales for fear their marriage would not receive legal protection, and those couples considering marriage could choose to forgo marriage altogether.  Also, the ill effects of further diluting the fundamental unit of society, the family, would certainly not be confined to those states that choose to recognize same-sex marriage; the impact would be nation-wide.  If any law is deserving of national uniformity, this is it.  (I note that though presently all states do define their own marriages, the overall definition is uniform.  What we are facing is a vast incongruence in the definition, the like of which we have not seen since the days of the southern bans on interracial marriage.)  I favor the Allard/Musgrave FMA as a way to achieve uniformity on an issue where I believe uniformity--and especially uniformity in accordance with what is best for society--is necessary.  To me, gays don't want recognition of same-sex marriage so they can show their partner how much they love them, or whatever.  No, they just want popular approval for their sinful lifestyle.  I don't think we should give it to them.  If you still aren't sure why law should only recognize the traditional definition of marriage, see Prof. J. Budziszewski  urlLink here .
