No doubt if you're reading this you know me, so there is no need to explain who I am or anything (phew), but if you have stumbled along here without knowing me, I'll just say that I'm Dave, live in England and am incredibly bored, so that is why I'm writing a load of junk that I doubt anyone will want to read. My life could be described as incredibly boring, so that's why I write this sort of junk..anywho, I have a lot more boring stuff to go do, so that will be the end of my very first blog...........And forth I go.
