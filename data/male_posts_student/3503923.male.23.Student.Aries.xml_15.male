There is the 'receipt saving penny-pincher' who is sure to know the exact time when the reducing labels appear on the shop floor. And in the blue corner we have the 'willy-nilly plastic swipers' who love to spend just because they have credit.  My observations are completely in line with ethnographical research methods, and therefore scientifically valid. If you would like to dispute any of my findings, which are rooted in relation to a specific time-context in an actual geographic location, you'll have to immerse yourself into my body; viewing the world through my eyes, and feeling the heat I feel in my arteries.  'Mad-Derek-On-The-Mike', was formerly the town crier, but now he spends his evenings at Asda engaged in pro-active selling. The radio cuts out, you hear the crackle of the microphone as it's switched on, a momentary silence now pervading the steel hut that many call Adsa; and before you know it, the familiar cackle of 'Mad-Derek' fills the air-waves, calling out to all bargain-hunters to come and snap up the irresistible Sushi, that is now knocked down to a remarkable ten pence.  This is when the penny-pinchers rush forth to grab their prize, the commotion builds, and the melee around Derek is about to swallow him up. An over eager middle-aged Japanese man is dumped on his backside in his efforts to beat 'Big Steve' to the last bag of toffee donuts. The penny-pinchers always deal in hard cash, mostly coins, rarely notes. They carefully count the loose change into your hand, making sure their not paying over the odds for their basket full of ten pence bargains. Their shopping bill varies from 50 pence on a quiet night, to Â£1.50 at harvest time.  Their haggard wallet holds an inch thick pile of the most inconsequential receipts, which they retain in the fear that something they have purchased may be defective. After slipping through the checkouts, they pause at the front door of the store, to carefully study the receipt, just in case they have been ripped off.  The willy-nilly people resent this kind of behaviour. Their avarice is well known, and they love to hear their platinum account cards swish through the cash register, loving it even more if other people hear it also. It's sweet music to their ears. They have no regard for receipts, abandoning them at the till as they leave. You see; there is no room for receipts in the Loui Vutton, it's too glamorous for that, not an ordinary wallet like the others, carrying only plastic and pictures of loved ones. They indulge in the 'Special' range, making them that extra little bit more special, trembling at the thought of a day when an economy product lands in their servant pushed trolley.  The willy-nillys' and penny-pinchers park in the same car-park, drive home in similar cars to the same neighbourhood. Who spends according to need? Who spends according to resources? Who spends according to fancy? I just can't work it out; social science, not really a science.
