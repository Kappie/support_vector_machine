Today, I had two Chemistry exams, again, I feel I have done ok in them.  Im not expecting much results wise, if I just pass my subject I will be so happy.   Have you ever really liked a girl, I mean really liked her, and you both get on really well, but sometimes they are cold towards you? How annoying is it? Tut.  Found out a very cool piece of news today - but I am not going to say.  A guy I know from a MikeJackson Message Board, asked me that if I led a political party - what would my policies be? Here they are:  I would make this country more tougher, non of this BS.  If you are proved GUILTY in a murder case, you shall spend you WHOLE life in a jail cell, or if you wish, face the death penalty.  IF there is an immigrant in the country, and is taking part in fraud, he/she can **** off back ot their country.  Taxes will go UP. You cannot have good things, and then not expect to many much for them.  Congestion Charges - EXCELLENT idea, I would impose them in Manchester and Birmingham also.  Racists will face jail sentances.  Also, build a few new jails around the country that will be able to hold up to 5,000 more people. I don't want drug dealers, rapists, frauds, thugs on the lose getting let off with cautions or a fine.  I would also make 100% sure that parents ARE allowed to smack their children if needed.  Make sure women only work in kitchens! :P - lol just kidding.  Pretty nifty I reckon.  I have to make some shirts for some girls - one of them girls is cool, so I said I'll do one or two for her. It turns out im designing 10 shirts.   *Over and Out*  Currently Listenin 2: Outlandish - Walou
