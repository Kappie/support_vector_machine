But not one line of short story has come out of me...  I'm beginning to see what Douglas Adams was talking about: "If fiction is your line, the only option is to drink way too much coffee and buy yourself a desk that doesnt collapse when you bang your head against it."  Too bad I don't drink coffee.   *bang*
