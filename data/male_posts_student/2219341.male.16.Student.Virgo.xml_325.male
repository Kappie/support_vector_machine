Victor Nivorsky is the bomb.  other than that i'm ticked... at life.  dunno why... i just feel like bein mad.  well.. its more like disappointed.  or frustrated.  oh goodness i dont know.  i'm ticked cuz i'm mad, disappointed, and frustrated!  there that makes sense!  so yeah.  i really cant complain.  its not like life is terrible or anything.  its just not goin exactly the way i'd like it to.  but whatever.  what's supposed to happen is happening and i cant change that.  anyways.  we'll see how it goes.
