      "As a lower-class kid, I was raised to think success would be owning stuff. Having that great job, too. Now I find my parents' dream was wrong. You never really own anything. And you're never really finished as a person. Still, you can be stuck, trapped by possessions and an outdated self image. Other than that, I think humanity is perfect. We're making the same mistakes we made 1,000 years ago. So they must be the right ones. So relax." - Chuck Palahniuk
