Went to summerschool today then came home and went to southland togo job searching, only got a few apps and i need to make a resamay so i can apply for some jobs.  After that stuff I saw Anchorman, that shit is one of the funniest movies ive ever seen.  I just might see that twice.  Yup thats all i did.
