I decided to investigate.  Turns out our ceiling is leaking again.  There's some soft of plumbing problem with the upstairs sink, which my dad will fix, but it will start leaking again later.  It varies how long the repair lasts, but the leaking is still rare enough to be unusual.  My dad's fixing it now as I type.  I'd just get in the way, probably break it more.  He won't hire a plumber because last time he did for something around here he got ripped off bad.  So, wait, I think he just got it fixed.  Okay.  Problem solved, thanks to... my dad's mad skillz, I guess.  Probably.  Just watched another movie.  It's nice having a brother who works 4-5 days out of the week at a full-time job earning $10 bucks a hour.  The lousy part is, I’m 17, and he’s 15.  I make $5.75 an hour working sporadically at BOCES.  Well, at least he doesn't know what to do with his money yet.  That's good.  Not for him, but for me.  He still won't submit to my wishes on finance completely, though.  And he still refers to my by that annoying nickname, "*B"  * for my name, B for Bankrupt.  Even though I always beat him at monopoly.  Actually, I'm pretty good at that game.  I usually win regardless.  Unless the other players gang up against me.  Especially if there girls.  Then I lose.  Badly.  Why I'm rambling about things I just talked about yesterday I don't know.  Probably because that's what on my mind, though why I don't know.  Today I tried to pull a crazy juggling act.  I was going to go to this party that the girl that I've been talking with on the net might go to with her boyfriend.  It started at 2, and went on who knows how long.  I was planning to go to that, that's all.  Then another friend of mine, who happens to be a girl, calls me that morning around 11.  She invites me to a music festival up past Oneonta "about an hour away from your place."  It's from 1-7.  I'm like, Sure!  Sound's great.  I'll be their a little later.  So, my plan is to go to the party for a hour or two, or three, however long it lasts, as long as it's not too late, then go to the music festival until it ends.  Sounds great, right?  So, at 11:30, my mom tells me that I have to be home to baby-sit by 4, 4:30 at the absolute latest.  Ohh...keyyy.  Not good.  Not good at all.  So I ask a good friend of mine who happened to be on the net at that time what he though I should do. So, I followed his idea pretty much to the letter.  His AIM is YamiArashi88, if you want to get some advice from him.  Oh, and for deep stuff advice, check out someone else.  You have to ask me to find out who they are, though.  Oh, and don't ask them what my real name is.  They won't tell you.  But if you ask, even though they won't tell you, I'll still figure out who YOU are and hunt you down and bring my Beretta and... sorry.  Got a little carried away.  I prefer to remain anonymous down here.  Unless you already know me.  Then it's your own problem.  Sorry.  Can't help you with that.  Unless you just happen to be a friend.  I have some of those.  They are nice.  Really nice to have.  Why am I rambling?  STOP!  Well, back to the topic at hand.  So, I go to the music festival first.  I leave so that I'll be there about 1.  Yeah, right.  Turns out she (the girl who told me about it) takes the back roads to get there.  And she said  about  an hour.  I get there about 1:45.  And I was going about 75 thee whole way.  In a 65 zone.  With police officers all over the place looking for drunk drivers.  Fortunally, I was a happy criminal.  So, I stayed there about 1/2 hour.  The music was ok, not my style, but good for country/gospel.  Plus I had a nice conversation with the girl who I haven't talked to since the Darien Lake thing.  So I leave there about 2:15, 2:20.  I drive at 80-85 back to Sidney, passing a car crash where a horse trailer had tipped over.  Don't worry, everyone and the horse was ok, the owner had it safely over to the side, but there was hay spilled everywhere.  Ok, just got back from being AFK a second ago.  Was making a snack.  Nachos with salsa and sour cream.  Mmm, sour cream.  Salsa is good; I just like the liquid stuff, not the chunks.  The chunks are ok, just not that good, at least to me.  STOP!  I'm rambiling yet again.  Why?  I'm nuts, no, even better, I'm ODD!  Well, I got to where the party was about 4:05.  Yeah, late.  I saw a few cars there, but not the girl who might have been there's car.  It's pretty identifiable, since the right external mirror is shorn clean off.  Nice green... something, don't really know cars.  I know what it looks like, but I can't tell you what it is.  So, since I didn't see her car, I went home, arriving at 4:18.  I probably was speeding, but by then I didn't care.  I haven’t heard from her yet, so she's probably was or is at her boyfriends apartment near Albany that he shares with some other guys.  I want to meet this guy, he sounds pretty cool from the way she describes him.  Well, she  is  probably biased.  Correction.  Not probably, IS biased.  He still sounds cool.  I'll have to see if I can "accidentally" run into them sometime in town.  I love accidents.  That kind, at least.  Not the normal kind.  Planned accidents are so much better.  SO much better.  Um... I promised content, but what you got was basically an update on my existence, which doesn't really matter unless you're me or get some soft of kick from reading someone else's ramblings.  So, here's my mini-review of Max Payne.  Max Payne:  Graphics: 8/10 Great for a third person shooter.  The particle effects are what make it all so cool.  Environments are a bit blocky and flat, though.  The graphic novel scenes are well illustrated, too.  Sound: ?/10 I am not going to rate sound, because I have no freaking clue to what to measure up against.  But, I will say, the heartbeat effect is really cool when you're in Bullet Time.  Level design: 7/10 While for the most part it seems constant (you spend WAY too much time in a hotel with the same dirty pictures and ads in EVERY FREAKING ROOM!!!), every once in awhile you'd get something really cool (the burning restaurant comes to mind, as well as the other hotel you get to go in, the one with the bombs blowing up.  Oh, and the lobby.  That is my favorite fight in the whole game.  Totally.) that makes the game memorable.  Equipment Varity: 6/10 About normal for your FPS, you have 2 melee weapons (lead pipe and baseball bad), 2 pistols (Desert eagle and Beretta), 2 shotguns (pump-action and sawed-off), 2 automatics (Colt Commando, an automatic rifle, and Ingram, a Uzi thingy that I KNOW I've seen before... in the Matrix), 1 sniper rifle, and 2 grenades (regular and Molotov Cocktails).  Nothing special, but you can dual-wield the Beretta and the Ingram, which is cool.  Bullet time using dual Ingram’s is the coolest FPS moment I think I've ever had.  Ever.  And that's saying a lot.  For me, at least.  Storyline: 9/10 This is what makes or breaks a game for me, usually.  Almost always, unless I'm in the mood for a mindless FPS.  The plot is excellent, if you like the gangster kind of stuff.  Or just the dark "film noir" style of it all.  That's what attracts me.  I feel this guy's pain as he just loses it all, then strikes back, at first aimlessly, then with purpose.  Single-minded near suicidal purpose, but that's ok.  I like it. A lot.  Gameplay: 6/10 If it wasn't for the fact that I usually hate and will refuse to play 3d person shooters, I'd give it a lot better rating.  I understand that all the cool visual and gameplay effects would be impossible without the view the way it is, but I still suck at it.  It's hard to aim, though I am getting better.  I die wayyy to easy, too.  There is a good deal of trial and error in this game until you get good at using the bullet-time feature to bail you out.  The special gameplay effects, namely, bullet-time, are what MAKE this game.  Without it, it would just be another 3d person shooter in the bargain bin.  I mean, the rest of the game is cool, but bullet-time is what sets this game apart.  I'll stop ranting now on this totally AWSOME feature.  Replayability: 7/10 Why am I giving this game such a high rating?  Because no other game is like it, and while it's decently long, it still felt a little short too me.  Plus, you unlock each difficulty level as you beat the one right below it!  Now if that isn't a shameless attempt to try to make you play this game again, I don't know what is.  Overall: 8/10 This game is awesome.  I recommend buying it.  I mean, at $10-15 buck at your local Wal-Mart, what's to lose?  Either you love it or hate it.  Try the demo first... if there is one.  Not sure.  I always try demos first... unless I can borrow a copy from a friend.  Like I'm doing with this game.  I hope he doesn’t want it back anytime soon...  OK guys.  It's late.  I need to go to bed.  Church today, then a picnic.  Must... sleep. Night!
