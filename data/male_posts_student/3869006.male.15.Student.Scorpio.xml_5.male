But after that things started getting weird :(. I guess she was just tired or sick or something :(, I wish I knew what was wrong so I could help her... After bussing it to her house we relaxed on their new super comfortable couch. I love her so much, and I hope that she tells me if there is anything at all I could do to help her. I'm going to bell fountain tomorrow, but I really just want to go to wild water works and spend some time with Ashleigh, but I guess that I'll be able to see Ashleigh soon enough I love Ashleigh so much, and I would never do anything to hurt her on purpose, and I am so sorry if I have done anything to make her feel anything less than the perfect person she is. -p.s. Ashleigh is probably the only one that is going to read this... so if this is Ashleigh reading this, I LOVE YOU ASHLEIGH!
