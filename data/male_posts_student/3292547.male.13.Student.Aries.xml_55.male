It loads a lot faster, but I don't get a username to delete everything. If ya wanna check it out, surf on over to  urlLink http://pics.xs.to/ . Have fun. It was the top rated of the ones I found, and it offer a wide variety of pics you can upload. Ok, so that was a joke. You can only upload .bmp, .jpg, .jpeg, .png  Anyway, see ya later.
