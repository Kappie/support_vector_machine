Old Hag: Where's that Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner?     Jimbles: Pardon?           Old Hag looks fed up, she talks into James's face...             Old Hag: That Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner!           Note: James is trying to serve customers. Laura (The Deputy Manager comes over)             James (To Laura): Could you help this Lady Please?     Laura (To Old Hag): How can I help you?     Old Hag: I want some of that Johnsons Cat Pet Littertray cleaner!           Laura and James are both confused because the Old Hag is slurring her words, she may be drunk... Laura tries to dismiss the Old Hag...             Laura: I don't think we sell it...           Old Hag is furious.             Old Hag: I've bought it from here before!           Laura thinks for a second, she takes the Old Hag to the product. The Old Hag comes back to the till to pay, at this moment in time there is no queue... After the sale is put through, Old Hag has got yet ANOTHER querie!             Old Hag: I bought a Playpen a couple of weeks ago and the bottom latch is stiff, I've lost my receipt what can I do?     James: You'd be better off asking Laura because if you've lost your receipt I'm not sure...           Old Hag is VERY furious. Note: A queue is building up... GRAVY!!!!!             Old Hag: I've got two cats to feed at home, I haven't got time!     James: Well if you've lost your receipt then I'm afraid you'll have to ask the deputy manager because I'm not sure...     Old Hag: I HAVEN'T LOST MY RECEIPT! I keep a record of all my receipts! But I ma have misplaced or mislaid it.     James: Oh well bring it back and get a refund.           Old Hag leaves, still unhappy. Tempted to say go and get hit by a car, but I'm not that heartless: I wouldn't want the driver to feel guilty!             Anyway it seems that The Old Hag was drunk or mentally ill, I don't care though, she was being a rare bitch and talking into my face, I don't like it when people talk into my face because it's intimidating and rude... Anyway I passed todays task as you  can see but I won't decide tomorrow's until after work...          TTFN
