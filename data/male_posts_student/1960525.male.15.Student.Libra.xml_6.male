RUBBER CHIKEN!!11oneone!! hehe, yeah....  ok but the second service wasnt as good because Jerika didnt sing the offeretory cause Dani was being posseive about it for the second one, go figure... ok but then after the allness (i promise more comprehinsive is to come, just not this late.) we (being me, and Jesse's family, and his friend from the Blue Man forums Chad Wina(maybe spelled wrong))  went out to Bennigings and had the awsomest lunch, our waiter was so cool, but you more at the later... then after lunch i came home and did my english paper, argued with Alex about doing the lawn, then watched The Simpsons, then ate, then did French Review, then this then sleep.  Alex is pushing for my company so ill go now, i will give you more detail later cause i know you are all so interested, after the lawn tomorrow i promise to try, or at night, whichever i cant do... later, night, bed bugs, bye
