I know i wrote that i didn't like this new album:  "A Match And Some Gasoline"  .....but i listened to it a couple times...and now i like it...it's wierd sometimes i will hate songs and then all of a sudden i will start liking them....i thought most of the songs are all screaming...but i judged them too soon...i listened to it again and it was only a couple songs....they still do stuff like in  Destruction Of Definition  ....and i just wanted to say this cd went from being one i didnt like to one i like....  Yea, I had cake for breakfast...and it was good....didnt have lunch tho...im not really hungry....  well i am gonna go...cya  "You aren't the boss of me!" -The Vandals
