Tuesday night she gets on and starts IMing me like mad while I'm at my friend's house.  She wants to talk to me or something.  So I get home and check my messages.  She's still on so I send her an IM.  We start talking, but something is different.  She's in a completely bad mood.  I realize this and ask her about it.  She doesn't want to talk about it.  That's fine, so I ask if she's alright.  She says:  "Sure."  I'm like ok... so then I tell her that I'mma go cause she asked me to stop swearing.  I mean I respect her trying to quit but I've listened to her swear up and down, dude... that's BS.  So anyways I'm about to go and she gets all sarcastic and says "Oh thanks for caring."  So then that totally sends me off the edge.  I've cared about this girl since the day I met her.  She's always been a friend to me and I've always been there to listen.  That's BS that I don't care.  It's just she gets all pissy and expects me to take it.  I dunno, I'll talk with her about it sometime.  Really pissed off right now.  In other news, no job yet.  Still just looking around.  Also, we're prolly moving to a house and outta this apartment.  Trade off, I guess.  No grass to mow up here, lol.  I liked that part of it >.  That is all.
