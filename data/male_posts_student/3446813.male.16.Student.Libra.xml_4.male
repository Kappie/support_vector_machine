So i really wont have time to update anything here. sorry all you fans of my writing *cricket chirps*...well come visit my site anytime (though its still being built) its all good. well the site would be  urlLink at tripod!   cya there fans o' mine!  ps i seem to have the same sn everywhere i go...i guess thats good...but then again very unoriginal. i've had this sn since like 7th grade, is it time for a change? i guess i possibly might be, since so many other ppl get new sns all the time. even my site's name is in my name (coolgi4) well...lets just hope it helps anyone searching for me find me easier cuz thats what im here for...i guess...to be found...or something... SHUT UP!!! MY ILLOGICAL THINKING DOES NOT NEED TO BE CRITICIZED!!!  *runs off crying*... *in a masculine sort of way*
