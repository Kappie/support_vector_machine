On the most basic and foundational level, Christianity is about what we do, our ethics.**  This stands in contrast to the position that espouses Christianity is (only?) about one’s system of beliefs.  What we as Christians believe is vitally important to how we describe ourselves or how we invite others to be a part of our faith communities.  Furthermore, it might determine what is unique about us. However, what often happens concerning our beliefs is that they are used to divide us from others.  This is neither a good description of who we are, nor is it inviting to others who may be seeking some kind of faith community.  The question, then, becomes: “What is unique about Christianity?”  A wide range of responses are the result.  What if it were easy to complete this sentence:  “All Christians…”?  I do not suppose finishing this sentence is an easy task. But, I do suggest that a good place to look would be Jesus’ words in Matthew 25:34-36.  Maybe then we could finish the sentence.  All Christians…feed people who are hungry. All Christians…give a drink to the thirsty. All Christians…welcome strangers. All Christians…clothe the naked, take care of the sick, and visit those in prison.  This describes Christianity as driven more by ethics than beliefs.  It strikes me as ironic that even as Christians are dividing themselves based on beliefs, Jesus divides based on ethics.  Just what did those sheep believe that made them different from the goats?  ------  **I prefer a simple definition of “ethics” to mean one’s actions, values, morals, politics, etc., rather than another term for what one believes or what doctrines are held.
