Then I went to church until 6:30 and my cousin's birthday party until 10:00. But now I'm home. I missed home. Overall, the competition went pretty well, although I'm not expecting to get more scholarship money out of it. But I stayed in a dorm with some really nice girls and, overall, it was a good experience. I hope I never have to do it again. I'll go and answer the Friday Five now, even though it's Sunday.  This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.
