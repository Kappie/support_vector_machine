Dreyfoos is like the heaven of all educational facilities... times 10. If I keep this thing going long enough... you'll find out all about it... if you dont already go there... which you probably do since most of the important people in my life go there... yeah. Bio thing: 15 years of age. 5"7, Brown hair (Kinda faded highlights), Brownish, Greenish eyes that change colors that depend on what I wear..., um, i guess pretty good looking, roman nose (kinda big), straight teeth (thank you braces), and of the few pimples i have, they will hopefully be gone in a few days after i get that proactive stuff from the television. Um, im pretty build, i work out, and i wear mostly hollister. 8 inches... thats my foot size. um, very hairy legs for all you kinky girls out there (wow, i just sounded like a desperate petifile... so much for a joke) Bio done.   So today was the fourth of july. Yeah. Is it bad that I hate the song "Proud to be an American" ? because I HATE IT!!! Its the most annoying thing ever put into song form. Maybe its because i have never experienced anything outside of this land, but i just cant find myself getting emotional and being appreciative of this country. Like, I am grateful to live here and do whatever i want (somewhat), but there is so much bad crap said about us that it kind of rubs off on this young, liberal, generation. Yeah... maybe i need to be dropped off in some third world country to finally appreciate it to the max... but for now, im just doing what i am told.  Yeah... so my third cousins came over today, and we went in Katies pool, then my jacuzzi. I was mostly on the computer all day. WE ate food, and then they went home, and i didnt get to go driving becasue my parents were entertaining... all I want to do is drive... only eleven months till i get my license. God, im going to be all over this town. So, then i lit some sparklers cuz my mom didnt want to buy real fireworks, and then i went upstairs and i said to myself. "Well Bobby, you've already lost enought self respect, why not throw it all out the window and start a blog!" So now im writing.  Tommorow I might be going surfing for the first time ever. yea. Thursday i might go on a date with Emily. Oh, life is such an uncertainty... but it's good. Good night.
