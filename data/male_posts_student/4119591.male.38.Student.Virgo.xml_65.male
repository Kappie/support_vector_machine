Using a "tweeny" and a miniature dachsund as test subjects, I've observed the following:      They sleep.     They eat.     They pee and poop.    They repeat as as often as necessary.    But what good are they? I also explored this question. And here's what I discovered:      They are adorable.     They are entertaining.     They have the capacity to love unconditionally.     They're darn cute!    I think we'll keep 'em!
