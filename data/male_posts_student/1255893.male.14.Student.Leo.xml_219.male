I also know I might not see some of you later on. To you I say, Im always gonna be here for ya, and whatever you may need, don't hesitate to ask. Im never too busy for my the people I care about.   Enough of that. IUE's over, last one till the fall. Just one project left, after that, we're good to go for summer. Right now, all I have to do is sit back and listen to the sounds of the traffic and my music playing off each other. They really do go beautifully together. That might just be me, but it sure does feel pretty right now.
