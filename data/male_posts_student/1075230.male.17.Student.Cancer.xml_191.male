Got a medallion and a piece of paper, respectively. Um... wanted the computer science award, but they didn't hand one out for the junior category for that subject, ah, oh well.    See, the thing is... i really shouldn't be getting awards. I didn't really try hard (I rarely do when it comes to school), so basically they're awarding me for something my parents hammered into my head when i was a kid. Umm... well, I guess you can kinda consider it compensation for that suffering... I dunno.    Award systems are really screwed up. Most likely, only 50% of the time, they'll go to the people that deserves it best. That's cause the only person who knows how much people have tried is God (or some other divine, all-knowing entity). Sure, there can be educated guesses when the candidates are people you know well. But when it comes to stuff like tonight, 50% is a fairly good estimate, IMO, considering they're just going by marks.    Of course, marks tell some of the story... you'd sometimes get higher marks if you try harder.   So, now back to real life facts: von won art award. justin chow, mike ip, tracy li, brian kwan got waterloo certs. donald got the cert and music award. karen ho got some award and the cert. nick cologna and kyle bibby got awards... mandy mcbean got top academic for gr10 amongst other awards. Last year 9ers - Josh liu and lily so - swept most of the awards in that grade.    It was interesting... my mom drove me, justin and his mom to ward... i feared for my life, cause my mom hasn't driven in like years. But all was well. For the first half, i was with them, then the second half, i went to sit with brian, tracy, donald and karen. So nice meeting friends there.    In other news, I'm behind like crazy, and chess, anime, newspaper and CSUNA will help me to do that more ^^   ~Chronos
