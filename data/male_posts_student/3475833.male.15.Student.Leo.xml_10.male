Awesome movie I might add. But I went and saw it without her, BIG MISTAKE! No, Wait, That coulda been fixed. But, God was stupid and just HAPPENED to place my sister's birthday on June 5. So, Being that my sister's birthday party would be the next day. I won't be able to go with Alyssa. Oh, yeah. She hates me now.  And she gets mad at me because I have a SMALL obsession over Alexa Vega, Carmen from Spy Kids. And Emma Watson, from HP, is hot too. Sorry, I'm a guy.  But on to the good stuff. I went to the Graduation. I loved it. I almost cried when they showed the video and Justin was in it, laughing, smiling, and just having fun. I was so happy when they called Amy's name. I hope everything works out for her.  And, I've been told, Sarah Conley, won her softball game. Whoo Hoo! Yeah Yeah. But, there is also a pile of mulch in my driveway. Boo Hoo for me. Tomorrow my sister turns 8. Sunday is her birthday. Alyssa I will try to go with you. Depends on the time.  Don't hate me too much!
