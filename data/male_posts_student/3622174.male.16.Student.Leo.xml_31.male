This one is available on AtomFilms Hi-Def's version for last week (which means, if you didn't have AtomFilms last week, you'll have to see it on your regular media player through the website, ha ha).  And it's hilarious.  At the beginning, this guy is holding a quarter, and it zooms in on the words "In God We Trust," then all of a sudden, he gets hit by one of those new extended Jeep things... and he dies.  He finds himself in the Death Determination Office (not sure what its called, but, that's what I'm calling it), where he learns that because of his negative life score, he is going to hell.  So, he quickly escapes and goes back down to earth, to try and regain some of those points back by doing good things.  However, the people at the Death Determination Office are trying to kill him in the process (ironic, right?).  Will he survive and go to Heaven?  You'll have to find out by watching it!   Pros  +Absolutely Hilarious +Great Production Value   Cons  -Eh, nothing!    Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Presentation: 100%-A Length: 100%-A Quality: 100%-A Final:  100%-A PLATINUM!
