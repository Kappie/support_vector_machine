It dosent make it any easier calling the girl I like. God, I wish she was online more. I just dont know what to do. I want to meet her, but I just dont know how to arrange it. *sighs*....  ....5 minutes later [22:19] endlessummer899: hey cant talk call me [22:19] DanTekGeek: i cant [22:19] DanTekGeek: no one ever answers [22:19] endlessummer899: i will [22:19] DanTekGeek: or your not hom [22:19] DanTekGeek: now? [22:19] DanTekGeek: or when?  then she signed off. I have konw fucking idea if she wants me to call her now, or some other time. I dont think Ill call her. I dont want her getting in trouble for someone calling this late. I think Ill call her tommorow morning, like 11. God, this is all so complicated.
