Well, actually not  some  more like  a lot .  My blog is not depressing, it's not supposed to be anyway, it's supposed to make you smile or possibly laugh if my recent update is stupid enough.  Didn't you guys read the "About" section?  It says that your not supposed to take most of the stuff I write seriously.  Most of the stuff I write is written in sarcasm, as it says in the "About" section over there ->.  Well, actually all of it is sarcastic except for the first post, of course.  Some people actually told me they cried after reading my blog!  That's not supposed to happen!  Stop crying damn it!  You guys are corrupting the atmosphere of my blog!  Don't cry, just smile, like this, =D, show people your pearly whites.  Now that we're on the subject of crying, why do people cry, get depressed, or get angry?  What's the point of it?  Being angry isn't going to solve your problems.  Crying isn't going to make the pain go away.  Being depressed isn't going to miraculously make your life better.  If you want to solve your problems or make your life better go do out and solve it or make it better yourself.  There's no reason to cry, get depressed, or get mad.  They're all just useless wastes of time.  If you want to change your life, go out and do it yourself, in today's world no one's going to help you.  Damn, this post sounds depressing also.  It's not supposed to be, it just turned out that way.  Maybe it's just me?  Oh well, who cares, it's not like any one cares about this blog... right? q=P  - Some loser
