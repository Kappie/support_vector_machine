I will personally castrate   the next person who I hear use "random" in casual conversation.  For those of you with a need to describe a situation "having no specific pattern, purpose, or objective," I present the following alternatives:  -aimless -arbitrary -casual -erratic -fluky -haphazard -impromptu -incidental -irregular -purposeless -slapdash   Really. Any one of these will do. Just please, for the love of god, stop over-using "random" before you're drawn and quartered by crazed statisticians.   (To all those who  will  comment using the word "random" thinking they're hilarious, clever little shits: fuck you and the liberal horse you rode in on.)
