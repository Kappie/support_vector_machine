Just as a passing note... suggestions for picture of the week are open, for anyone who has an idea they would like to see...  well, you know, its very hard for me to come up with anything interesting to say at the moment. i am completely lacking inspiration...  i could attempt to write a long story about nothing, but that would make my site suck even more than it has to... so ill refrain... and go dominate the snooker world.  ttfn...
