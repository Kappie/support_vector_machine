So all you people who finished early and wanted to talk. Too bad for you. Then I had band which was just playing and talking the whole time, no real final. And then PE we finished our PE test which is totally gay anyways in about 15 minutes because we cheated. Easy as that. But then the like hour and 20 minutes in there was horribly long. I thought it was never going to end. But it did, and then me, brian, and andrew walked home. We went to Brian's house and dropped off his stuff, then went to Andrews and I guess he couldn't come out to eat with us... so we walked to my house to go get my bike. But on the way there the wonderful Haley was driving with her sister and they picked us up and we went to Monicals with her and Jenny and millions of other girls. It was awesome. Then after that, my sister came and picked me, Brian, and Haley up and we went back to her house and played the best game ever. Dance Dance Revolution. I mean you can't beat that game, its imposible. Even when you cheat like we did. People who do that are crazy... and I mean really crazy. So we stayed there for awhile, and then left. Then I went over to Brimfield and watched my cousin Matt graduate from 8th grade. Then we went out to his house and he lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. I just sat in the middle of the road, because there was no cars ever! I could sleep out there in the middle of the road. Its that dead! I loved it! It would be so awesome to live out there. But then it got really weird on the way home. First, we hit traffic. I mean come on! Who in the heck has traffic at 10:00 at night!? Well I guess East Peoria and Peoria does on I74. Who ever made that genious idea up, screw you. So there was traffic and we were in it for about 10 minutes and then we took an exit through East Peoria. We were going and my mom totally like lost it, she had no clue where she was going. She was pulling into Steak 'N Shake and I'm like, "Mom what are you doing?" and she goes "Oh what am I doing!? I was suppose to go left!" I'm like wow... So we finally get going the right way. And then we were at a red light right, and there is this guy in another car right. Well he was starring at me! I'm like what is this guy doing!? And then he nods at me! Well this guy was a guy that looked like he was gonna rape me. So I go "Mom this guy is scaring me" and she is like do you know him? And I'm like, No. She is like "Oh look! Green!" and she slams the gas. I felt like the guy was following us. But he wasn't, or so I think. If I die tonight, you know who did it a guy in a silver Lexus! But we finally got home and it's like 10:39 right now. Hmmm, I don't want to go to bed, but I have another final tomorrow. Should I? Well, I'll stay up to 11:00. Tomorrow is the last day of school. Only till 9:55... I'm sorry if I'm wrong about that Ryn. I believe it's 9:55, hopefully? Oh well, time to listen to some music. Or eat something. Food is good too. Music or Food? Who knows. Nite.
