If you know your pop culture shit, you will enjoy this.  If you don't, you will think it is utter and complete garbage.  Later on, after a shower, I did nothing.  Well, not entirely.  I played bass and listened to Franz Ferdinand (who are awesome... by there album.)  I watched Jeopardy, on which this guy has now won over $440,000.  He is unstoppable.  Anyway, later Sarah called.  "It gon rain." she said.  and thus, my search for a new recipient of a ravinia ticket began.  After a few failed attempts, I called James Noyes.  And wound up with a bit of an upgrade.  I ended up inside the pavilion.  Ben folds was awesome.  James's family were nice people.  although his brother was really annoying.  He asked a lot of irritating questions.  Not that I'm bitching about free tickets and dinner.  His parents tried to get me to come to an Obama fundraiser.  It was quite amusing.  After the show, we swapped some musical interests, and I went home.  Forgot to watch new Degrassi (grr... tomorrow I suppose).  and since then I've done nothing.  And that's my life as of now.  -Mike  "I pushed you 'cuz I loved you guys, I didn't realize, you weren't having fun."
