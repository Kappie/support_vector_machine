Now for the continuation of the on-going Tyke and Tina situation.  Well today after school Tina had detention.  Tyke knew this and they happened to see each other in the parking lot.  They talked in the Senior lot for a little and then Tina said she was going to detention.  Tyke said he would walk with her and he did.  They talked about how weird and annoying Yurtle Yuck was and then Tyke asked Tina if she wanted to just sit in his car while they waited for Michelangelo to go supervise detention.  So they got to his car and saw Michelangelo walking back to the school so they got out and walked together towards detention.  On the way there Tyke said hi to Commander Cool (cool name, eh?).  Tyke and Tina talked some more and then got to detention to find out that Michelangelo wasn't there so they couldn't even start detention yet.  So Tyke stayed and they talked and also with another girl.  Tina and the other girl said that Tyke should stay and just serve detention with them but he didn't know if he would.  About 5 minutes later Michelangelo came to watch over the detainees and Tyke decided not to stay so he left Tina and put in an order for his transcripts.  This experience may have sounded boring but it was not and it was exciting.  The question Tyke thought of though was does Tina know that Tyke is so head over heels for her?  He felt it was obvious that he was.  He walked all around with her after school and almost did detention with her when he didn't even have it.  Doesn't this seem like a little bit more than just a friendly gesture?  Maybe Tyke is just crazy.  The next thing that Tyke thought about was whether or not he should show Tina this Blog.  Maybe tell her: "Next time you are bored at home by yourself go to (insert URL here)."  But could this ruin things?  Give Tyke your thinking (especially if you are a girl since that is what Tina is).
