That really put me into sad mood.  :-/  After the fireworks, a 10-year-old boy threw a basketball at me and punched me.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I didn't do anything.  I just rememberd what I was like when I was ten.  I don't think I ever did anything like that.  Oh well.  Even though my day was not good, tomorrow I have to look forward to.  I don't have anything I have to do, so I suppose I could do anything I want.  Good night.
