I'm on a couple of alumni e-mail lists from Princeton, and on one of them there was just a post:   My daughter will be entering her senior year.... She is very much interested in an internship/apprenticeship this summer, anywhere in the U.S., in the field of glassblowing. She is very serious about glassblowing as a career.... If anyone has any leads or ideas... Hmmm.  Glassblowing as a career.  Interesting.  Sounds like fun.  And never  a question about what gifts to give on holidays and birthdays.  "Thanks so much for the vase!  I put it right next to the candy dish and the candlestick holder!  And the other seven vases!"
