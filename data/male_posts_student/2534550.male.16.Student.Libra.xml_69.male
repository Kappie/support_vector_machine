Why? dunno, i think its the lack of rain and cold, i do get a bit restless in class but when i get in my car and take the top down its just...GREAT. So today i went to Jordan Viets house and i have decided that i need to move. his house is so sick and i think im going there this weekend.  I have effectivly portrayed myself and Sadia on the road as well...Crazy. Today we decided that we would bumb some Brittney Spears on the highway and dance around as all the people in the cars stared and we cracked up. Then we bumped it REALLY REALLY loud outside her house and got out the car and danced around the car, it was so fun.   Ummm i then picked her up and we went down to my school for open house which was kindof dumb aside from the fact that we got free food.   So yea i guess the next thing is that i get to leave next week for DisneyLand with choir. the only thing im not looking forward to is that whole 9 hour bus ride thing but its ok cause i can sit next to Britt. But i dont know how long im going to be able to stand people on a bus ride. but ill get through it.   Well i guess thats it until soon, cya
