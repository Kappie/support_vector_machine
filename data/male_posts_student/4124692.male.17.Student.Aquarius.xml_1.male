What are people in relation to pure hard cash. Unfortunately the world is goverened by oligarchies, which control the means of production, communication and policy making. So where does that fit me in? Well, it leaves me, and you, right out of the equation. Being part of the first world doesnt mean much to our leaders. Money is worth much more than you or I could ever be. Probably the most disgusting thing happening in the world other than the various wars, genocides, natural disasters etc... is the way that the third world is kept in constant submission through debt, the WTO, IMF and the European Common Agricultural Policy, whilst at the same time the first world leaders are busy claiming that the third world has never had it so good. We wreck their economy's, steal their resources, and then send them the bill. All to continue to allow our own egotistical consumerist culture to grow and prosper. It would be nice if everybody could be rich wouldn't it? But the whole point about capitalism is that it relies on someone getting the better deal out of someone else, and this is exactly what is happening today, just on a larger scale. The WTO is much more lethal than any bomb, tank or battleship. It's main weapon is it's pretence that it is working for the improvement of the third world, when in fact its doing the opposite, working to keep the third world in submission and send it even further into debt. But its got our backing because it makes us richer. The question we have to ask ourselves is how long are we going to continue being egotistical and demanding ever increasing luxuries for our consumerist culture at the expense of other people who share this world and break their backs for pittance. And when we finally see the light, the rich arent going to give up easily. There's gonna need to be a whole lot more rioting before long...
