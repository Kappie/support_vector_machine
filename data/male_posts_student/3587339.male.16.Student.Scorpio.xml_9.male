Glory to the mullet Gods as we offer sacrifices and burnt offerings of fruity smelling candles.  The armies of the mulletron will one day rise again in their  MULL titudes.  I do not personally have a mullet but a few of my friends have done so.  One in particular had his cut right before a prom/banquet/crappy school function sort of thing.  It was okay though since his date was wearing vampire fangs.  As another one of my friends so eloquently put it "Your wierd, your wierd, nice couple...la la la la la"  Yeah he's pretty freaky too.  But who could blame him.  He was in the presence of something far more potent that the strongest car freshener.  In the light of the coming mullet warriors i christen this blog with beer in hopes that my actions of faith will not go unnoticed on the day of the return of the mulletitans.  Until then be wary what you say...and...brush your teeth.
