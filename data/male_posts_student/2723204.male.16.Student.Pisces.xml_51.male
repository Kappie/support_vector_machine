Socialism is egalitarian but doesn't make use of people's talents effectively. So-called "equal opportunity" laws also in fact interfere with making use of people's talents. They don't let you hire the person you think will be best. Paying people different salaries and hiring them in any other way than running a lottery is anti-egalitarian but it improves use of talents.    Actually, the system or ideology which I actually described is not really close to socialism at all, but rather its the principle of meritocracy. Socialism is really what I like to call “shoving egalitarianism down people’s throats,” and of course, this causes much indigestion. The comparison of these two systems can be very much analogous to a race. Meritocracy, basically does not care what’s your background or status, meritocracy ensures everybody is at the same starting line, and that everyone goes at the same time the gun sounds. As for the race, it is up to the athlete’s will and physical ability and endurance to complete it and win the 1st place. What about socialism? Socialism basically says that everyone must win! And that everyone crosses the finish line together. But winning is never really winning until someone loses. However, if your principle of social differentiation is applied in this analogy, there won’t be any race at all, the outcome is pre-determined anyway!  That’s what I meant by egalitarianism is what enables societies to make use of talents more effectively. I actually meant to say meritocracy rather than egalitarianism, as egalitarianism is too broad a term. Meritocracy rewards a person on the merit he or she achieves and the nature of that merit and assigns that person to a particular social role, rather than assigning that person to the social role from his/her sex, race etc. etc.    Depends on what you mean by human beings. Fire preceeded modern human mental abililties, and homo sapiens has always used fire. Also, the fact that there have been radical unprecedented changes doesn't show that  any particular radical unprecedented change will happen or be beneficial. Such changes remain extremely unlikely until they actually happen.    Actually my disbelief of universalism is very much philosophical. I believe that even if a particular situation or belief can be described as having the ability to change, even hypothetically, it basically proves that it has ability to change in accordance with time or with the environment. When it does not change, it simply means that it refuses to use that ability. But since, it has been proven as having the ability to change in a hypothesis, it is proof that the ability is there, and thus it can be regarded as non-universal.  (it’s a little confusing, its philosophy anyway lol .)  And also, on whether the changes are beneficial or not. The “changes” I was referring to is really to the environment and circumstances around us. Not the change of ideology where gender is concerned. I never believe in positive or negative changes where the environment is concerned. It’s the way we respond to that change which makes it positive or negative.    Sex has been around about a billion years. I agree that over that  period it's had varying effects on behavior. Still, a prediction that the effects of something so fundamental to life as the effects of sexual differences is not just going to change but become irrelevant seems unlikely. I have no idea why I should believe it.    There is a gender divide and difference no doubt. But what really constitutes the majority that divide? Is it human and social expectations or is it the very nature of humans itself? I agree that sex has always been fundamental to human life. But what makes us think that it WILL be fundamental to human life. A billion years can be long or short, depending on your perspective. Using my sushi and fish-and-chips analogy, sushi has basically been the very cornerstone of Japanese cuisine, but is it right for a Japanese chef to not know the art of making sushi and set up a fish-and-chips restaurant? I think so.   Gender is basically like race, we thought that race do determine our character and attributes. But in fact, race simply INFLUENCES our character and attributes. The same goes for gender. (look at my Mozart analogy).    Why think it's right for this day and age? Also, if everything changes in time why shouldn't things change by place or situation or among individuals? How do you know that even if feminism is right for you in your situation right now it's not wrong for others and won't become wrong for you in the not-so-distant future?    Why do I feel that feminism is the right ideology for this day and age? Simple, Confucianism and a hierarchal structure is becoming increasingly outdated in our time. A simple gauge is the evolution of our economy, to survive in the new economy; companies diversify and companies value workers which are versatile. Workers know that they have to take up new courses and chalk up work experience outside their field of expertise, in case there’s a downturn in their industry and they lose their jobs.   No one has “fixed’ roles in our society anymore. I have seen people turning from office-worker to homemaker to investor to businessman all in the span of less than six months, insurance agent by day, taxi-driver by night, stock-broker by day, and pimp by night. These are very common scenes in our modern society.   Even if you know that certain pockets of society do have fixed roles, our socio-economic structure is certainly moving towards that direction.    So you're saying that people have a fixed nature.    A vector quantity is a quantity which has both magnitude and direction. What I’m saying is that people are born with individual characteristics not influenced by sex or race. But however, it is society and social norms and expectations which actually serve to either nullify or develop their potential. And soon, people conform to what society expects of them in accordance to their sec or race.    The short-changing of talents would be much less common than in your belief of gender non-differentiation, which is the belief that roles should  always be completely identical for men and women.  There are always social roles. Why does it lead to a better fit if the roles have to be exactly the same for men and women instead of varying by sex?    I believe that you have completely missed my point. I never believe in totally homogenous social roles, but rather inter-changeable ones. I am not against a “caste” system in general, but I am against a rigid one. Our society has to be flexible, we are no more living in the past where major changes happen every few generations or so, major changes happen in less than a decade. As the environment changes, society has to move to accommodate the change.  I have never said that men and women should switch roles. If people think that’s the underlying ideology of feminism, then they’re very much ill-informed, Feminism is about flexibility. It is the ability to choose the social role one wishes to take up without any coercion, subliminal or otherwise.
