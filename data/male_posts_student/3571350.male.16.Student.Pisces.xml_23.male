I love the sport. As long as the teach doesn't treat me like a baby i'll be fine. I'm so excited about it now but it's on saturdays so it will be frustrating. There was something I was going to talk about but I forgot! I guess I wanted to say that the olympics start in two days and I get full coverage. Anywho I hate hot weather when I'm sleeping but in the middle of the night it gets soo cold I was freezing. Well gonna go and i'll post again once I figure out what I wanted to say.
