I didn't feel like crap.....and I have come to realize that Contac-C is fairly useful in times like these. Well.....after all the work yesterday of cramming a whole bio project in one night....here's the result:     An aerial view of "G.I. World"       Rectal Rangers.....where evil intestinal parasites lurk     Pretty nifty huh =P? I personally thought we did a pretty good job on this project. And I think I did a good job on my part....considering for the whole time I was coughing, sneezing, sniffling, and having a head more stuffed than a..........stuffed teddy. So after catching sleep for 7 hours, and missing band, I finally woke up at 7am....to a very unpleasant feeling of crappiness in the morning. That all changed though.....all thanks to Contac-C lol. So in the morning.......ate breakfast....and then took Contac-C, washed it all down with some OJ and then headed to school......of course after morning routine. While packing the project, almost broke adam's Esopha-Drop, but other than that it was good =).  So on the way to school......talked to Pat since I gave him a lift today. He seemed amused with the bio project....and was curious to why there were Micro Machines on it. Well I'll explain now....they're "visitors" to the park lol. Imagine the guns aren't there hehe. Radio today was pretty stupid...oh wait was it even on? I don't remember....was too attentive trying to explain the whole park to Patrick. It really was a work of art....though I'm still sniffling from post-sawdust syndrome.......that's ok....most of the reason probably was from me in shorts, sandals and shirt in 5 degree weather. The sawdust was just another factor to make things worse.  Finally arriving to school.......I struggled to get the project upstairs. Thank goodness people at Central are willing to hold doors.....or my project woulda been smooshed going up the flights of stairs just to reach 3rd floor. Well finally reaching the 3rd floor.....Tehmina then notifies me that I should beware when I go to room 301 since apparently Mr. Pigeon was pretty pissed off today. So I quickly went in, dropped off the stuff and then headed to first period class: Music.  Music class consisted of still choosing our pieces.....of which I will do at Belle-Air soon. I still chose an auxiliary piece though just incase....but Dave Rutt told me to get a Ariose or sometin' by Bach. RCM 6....gotta remember that. So we played........Mrs. Wharton noticed my absence in band and gave me the evil glare that all teachers seem to possess......and then we went on with music. Lots of counting stuff today.....since it seems many gr. 10's can't count past 4 in music....and practiced some songs for music night. Not much happening in class......easy breeze class like usual.  Finally reaching science class, I finally get to see the portfolio that Underhill typed up for our bio project. Look's pretty good actually....and I'm beginning to like taking pictures with a D-Cam lol. We did some lab today with ecology......about how animals thrive and stuff with food and without. Lab's due Thursday....same day as english exam. Argh. Finished that.....and then left for lunch...  Oh wait there is no lunch for me today....I have to go finish bio project lol. So we headed into library....plugged in my glue gun *is that allowed? oh well* and started finishing it up. Okanski ran to his place to grab the project portion he had and came back....and we began glueing together our masterpiece. We were fairly organized with it.....and quickly managed to finish up the project.....then off to bio we went. While milling away to bio class....I then see that the whole hallway is littered with bio projects for 4th period class. Wow....some of them were AMAZING *Lindsay's group and Tehmina's group had crazy ones* and also another two gr. 11 groups had REALLY good ones. I then look down on mine....and think deep inside *aww nuts* but reassuring myself *Joe you may have Chinese failed....but you still are Joe Passing.* Well to bio class....  Instead of the proposed lab for today.....we each presented our project for fun. And then after that while explaining our lab, Ms. Wiener would for some reason make a sound effect for everything she did *example following:*  After taking the mouthpiece, *yoink yoink* you can then clean it in the ethanol just like this. Dipping it in *dip dip* you then rinse it off *rinse rinse* and then shove it onto the machine *erk erk.*  It was pretty funny...but yeah highlight of bio class today had to be the projects.....all of them were so cool...But I really hope we don't have to do this again.....takes so much stinkin' time to complete and money....argh I spent 50 bucks @ art store for all the crap.....and the plywood was never used. But the project was worth it I think.....it looked pretty nice. But yeah.....after that class....FINALLY......the final class of  the day which I'll summarize very quickly....  English class.....prepare to write exam on Thursday. Prayers please for that....ugh I hate exams.....especially english. So unpredictable. Well at least we can bring in notes for reference....but stilll ENGLISH UGH! WHY NOT LEARN SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE!? Oh well......off to making my notes tomorrow I guess....ergh hopefully I do well....got 65% on first exam this year....argh......  Busing home then.....I got off at Sarnia and Castlegrove like usual. Surprisingly though I see Adrian....and chatted with him...well until the next Whitehills bus came lol. Yeah so apparently he did move out to Grand Bend, and lives with his dad now. Was kinda surprising though since only 3 weeks ago he was over at my place....what a change in location and times lol. SO we chatted for a bit.....and then we both went our ways since he had to go to UWO to find his dad to get home *his dad's a professor there* and I walked back home with Ryan....since well his Whitehills bus came by. Wow.....I sat there for 15 minutes. Amazing how fast time goes by lol....  Getting home......I get informed with the recent news. IMPORTANT news....like Hermann got 4th in WOSSA and Gavin got 7th. Lina got 11th, and by the way this is all badminton. What other news......umm oh yeah from before I finally realize Red Wings are out of the playoffs *NICE* and the flames now go on to play either San Jose or Colorado *Better be the Avs....they'll OWN them =P.*  Anyways.....I'm out for this entry. Got some stuff still to do tonight, plus band tomorrow, plus I'm still half sick. Cya.
