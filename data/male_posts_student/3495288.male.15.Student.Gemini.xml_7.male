The reason so for this nick name was that Amirul now is trying to make me feel guilty for telling the Dicipline Commitee. As you know i wrote a 'Student's Sentence' about me being threatened by him. I couldn't take the pressure from him no more. So i had to turn to one of the teachers but instead he passed the baton to the Dicipline Commitee.      Today in school every time he/i bump into each other He would like try to make me feel guilty by saying,  "THANKS ALOT DEN FOR TELLING THE DM" or "EH! BOY! THANKS ALOT! NOW I AM EXPELLED!" or "THANKS ALOT DEN! DON'T WORRY AH I WON'T DISTURB YOU NOW. I AM GOING TO CHANGE SCHOOL THANKS TO YOU.".  Like MAN! stop it already. I hate it you know. He is irritating me every single minute of my life. He is trying to make me come up to him and wanting me to make a move. Eh.. Sorry i am calm and cool. I don't care about you now, AMIRUL HAFIZ. My intention/mission now is to protect, help and counsil my little sister, Moon (Muneera ... hope i spell it correctly. :P).    After recess, i knew he was staring at me from the back. On the way down the stairs, his friends (who are also my friends) wanted to confront be but instead they irritated me by asking, "Eh Den. Why Amirul want to change school? What have you done Den? Your own friend.".  Like URGH! SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH HIM! SO WHAT HE IS CHANGING SCHOOL, SO WHAT HE IS EXPELLED AND SO WHAT THE FUCKING HELL IF HE BEATS ME UP!  all he wants me to do now is to make a move and than he can make his move.    I couldn't stand it anymore. After school. Amirul "threatens" my little sister for a patch up but lucily i was there so he had to move away. I told her not to and NEVER patch back with that idiotic, mean, irritating and stupid AMIRUL.    Just now, I and Ash have decided to seperate for a short period of time so that both parties to cool down. Well we might caught up with each other with Roy and Daniel when Daniel and I, Roy, Ash and maybe our son Dan go for the FIESTA concert at the Botanical Garden. Well i will be going with Daniel, Roy and Ash (as for our son... i dono hahah). I hope i can cool down. Well erm till here lah... too angry about Amirul and Too happy because Ash is happy. :P bye.
