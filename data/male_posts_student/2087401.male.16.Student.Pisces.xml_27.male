But the rest of my brain overided this thought almost immediately, so I didn't dwell on it. I learned long ago that what my brain overrides, I don't want to know anyway. So I moved on.  The smaller man got a hold of himself and handed me a bunch of papers. "This is the time and place of our next meeting. Be there with only the things that are necessary." Then they walked out of the Starbucks and drove away in a black jaguar. Nice car.  I finished my chai tea and walked out onto the street. Suddenly the world looked different to me. I had a purpose now. No more boring Gillian, who brings Jim his coffee every morning. I'm a new woman, I told myself, I should act like one.  I straightened up, and walked purposefully down the street. I got about five steps before my heel hit a pothole, causing me to fall on my face in a not-so-graceful way. Relax, I told myself, More Queen Elizabeth, less Sandra Bullock in Miss Congeniality.  As I set off again, I wondered about what this mission was about. Was it a secret government conspiracy? A mad scientist testing out time travel? Or did the Matrix truly exist? I hope it's the third one, I thought, I want a long black leather coat. Plus working with Keanu Reeves wouldn't be too bad either.  Well, I said to myself, let's see how deep this rabbit hole goes.
