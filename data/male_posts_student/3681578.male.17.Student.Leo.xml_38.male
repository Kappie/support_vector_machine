It was hard, trying to explain what the types of nouns are and how to add fractions with different denominators to section 9 grade 6 students...it was kinda fun though...not really...maybe so-so...but it was not great...  TinTin and I were "first-timers" so we really felt kinda stupid at first...then, we were actually "section-less" but we soon figured out with the help of Arvie that I belong to section 9 and that TinTin could replace someone from that section as well...so we started...  First, Arvie gave his kids break and I would have followed suit but Kuya someone told me that we were not supposed to have breaks...I was actually very hungry at that time and so were my students...  It was also kinda stupid because I was not able to prepare much since me and TinTin did not have "lesson plans"...I promised my kids that I would give whoever got the highest scores in the test reward...  However, I soon found out that what the right things to do were...I kinda thought everything was lame at that point...but Kuya someone had a point...but I agree with Arvie...there is this dilemma...all Gabay people are supposed to do "erya" every week but some do not attend...like me and TinTin...we are allowed 3 absences yata and beyond that, you are knocked out of Gabay...but if that rule will be imposed, there will be fewer "tutors" for the "tutees" and so the remaining tutors will have to shoulder the responsibilities...  After the erya, I went back to Ateneo to return a book in the lib and borrow another one...then I went to other places to get stuff...  Now I am supposed to reread the stories and get a strong grasp of the Elements of Fiction for my midterms on monday plus I will do my version of our report outline for Filipino which is due on Monday...  By now I feel nice about my teachers save Dr. Pesigan and Dr. Marasigan...I actually like Salazar now...I definitely liked Mark Cayanan, Arthur Gerona and I found Fritz to be very nice...  There...I'll try to do work now...  --Logged Out--
