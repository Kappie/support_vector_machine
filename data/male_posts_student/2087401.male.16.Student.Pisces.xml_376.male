As far as further information goes, they are 6 and 8 dollars at the LC box office. If you buy them on Tuesday you get entered in a raffle to win a hundred dollar Simon Mall gift certificate.  Design for Murder kicks ass. It has murder and intrigue and peope oozing sex and me in a wig. It's really a good play, which is why we blew everyone else out of the water at regionals yesterday.  I don't want to comment on the other plays there. That would make me sad. Except to say that the straight version of the Scarlet Pimpernel was the worst one, and one of the people in the cast wore tennis shoes. In Cheaper By the Dozen almost everyone wore no shoes. And the name of one of the chorus girls in Little Shop was Bingbing Chu. I am not making this up.    Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!
