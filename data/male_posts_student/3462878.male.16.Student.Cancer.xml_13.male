Bollocks  Not only do people not talk to each other any more, but text messaging language has fucking taken over!  I mean, people are becoming lazier and lazier with their writing style. For example, I might text someone (which sounds sick in itself), just because I can't be arsed to talk, in perfect English, vowels included, and then be replied with 'K cul8r' WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN?! (I know what it means, but to someone who has never been outside might not have a fucking clue)   If you can't be arsed to use the Queen's English, don't bother speaking. I know from time I might mess things up, but I at least I'm trying, there are some people who just always whenever they're on the computer or have conversations over text messages ALWAYS  Lzy bstrds...  Anyway, off to the Prom tonite, so I might be back tomorrow with more rantings, which could include anything from crying (other people around me crying, I'm too macho) to frigging dancing.   Oh the joy...
