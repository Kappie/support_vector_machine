People in the hall were being REALLY loud while we were working on a quieter scene of the show.  I had to go out FIVE TIMES to tell them to try to keep it down.  Not the fun part of this job at all.  Other than that, it didn’t go too bad.  We were missing a couple of actors due to conflicts, and started about 40-50 minutes late due to an actor’s late arrival, but Scott did a great job of making up the time, and we were out of there on time.  Not too shabby.   11:22am  I miss my friend.  I hope she’s doing okay.
