Still pretty boring, I got A's for all my exams, that freaked me out. I attempted to talk to Laura and for once she actually acknowledged that I exist. That an improvement. I got another Tool CD too, they are almost the best band I know. (http://toolband.com) I've been listening to a lot of A Perfect Circle lately and they are a very good band. I'll have to get some more tabs so I can play some of their songs. I believe in music above all things, it is like oxygen to me.  I haven't given any advice for a while so..... - Don't want for anything you don't know you can have. The most likely thing is you'll get dissapointed.  - Believe in something, anything, and if you can it will keep you going. - If you want to do something just do it, don't worry about what other people will think or what they're going to say about you. Who cares? If they're that low you shouldn't bother talking to them anyway.  There, done my good deed for the day, attempted to improve people's lives. Job Done.
