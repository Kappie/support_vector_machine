I was close to my exit and going around 75mph when I looked back behind me and a motorcycle was fast aproaching my car. I moved over a bit to let him pass between myself and another car in the left lane. Now, this manuver is perfectly legal in California. It's called "lane sharing" and I normally don't think anything of it. It's a kind of benifit for using a more economical mode of single passenger transportation. When you are stuck in traffic, you can move right between all the stopped cars.  Put what freaked me out was the high speeds at which this person decided it was appropriate to make this move. If I happened to miss him in my mirror, he would have went flying all over the road.  That is seriously fucked up. No matter how many times people piss me off or in general irritate me, I would honestly say that I would never want to kill someone on purpose or by accident. I ran the question by my self as I exited the freeway, "How would I feel if I accidentally took someones life?" You take away everything they ever had or will have with one mistake. I would be devestated. I can't imagine the shear magnitude of calling to arms a military with the soul purpose of killing people on both sides. With war you are garenteed that someone will die, no of old age. Fuck that, I hate people some times and even think to myself that I might wish harm upon them but it all comes back to you. I would never really want something bad to happen to anyone.  With that said, I have a hard time with humanity on an indivual level, I can care on a global or even national level but one on one caring is not my strong point. Maybe I am hear to care for the earth and it inhabitants. Maybe I can have a hand in reversing all my destruction and the destruction of my blood.   current mood:  thoughtful current music: Hot Water Music - turnstile
