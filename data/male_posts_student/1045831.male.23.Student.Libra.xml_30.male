I'm gonna go hang out at Mark's tonight cuz I never see that kid anymore and then I will write about it more tommorrow but I just felt like i had been slacking in my updating of the "Life and Times of Zeke"..  So have no fear I will be back and better than ever soon..  Ohh yeah.. I have a fun goal that I am working on but i can't say what it is but all you people who have "Faith" just a little help from the man upstairs would be nice...  Thanks..  Peace out all my homies..  Keep it real
