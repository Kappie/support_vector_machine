"of course!" my brother said he didnt notice the girls. yea right, unless he's gay or something. actually, that's a good possibility...then they looked in my photo album...AAAAAHHH...they kept on laughing about how i wrote captions for my pics. gayzel couldn't find me in a soccer pic, she kept on pointing at white kids and saying "is this you?" then sindy grabbed my patterson yearbooks even though she said only gayzel went to patterson. suspicious, no? natasha took my 8th grade thornton yearbook ("no! not the blue one!") and i tried to take it back. they were all lying on my bed, and i turned out the lights. haha. they kept on trying to have alex and gayzel sleep together, on top of each other, whatever. they wanted everybody to fuck each other and go together in closets and stuff. sindy kept on backing away from me. i found a bunch of pillows and the girls lay down on the floor, gayzel said it was hot. only cuz alex was there. i kept on trying to lie on alex but he...er...moved around. "stop ryan, you're getting me horny!" it got late, so everyone got off each other and put on their clothes and went to the backyard to get some peaches. "i don't like soft ones, only the hard ones." hahaha...they were about to leave, but natasha wanted me to hug sindy but sindy didn't seem to want to so alex kinda pushed me to her and she spilled her soda. lol o boy. but they left. fun stuff.   crapp, this is like how alex writes, except less funny. o yea, look at my subprofile too if you get the chance. bye for now.
