Ommmm, and I'm a little crazed because I've just drank some caffeinated coffee (omm naughty!) which drives me nuts, but I'm keeping myself awake on purpose.  Believe it or not, there are going to be TWO COMETS in the Northern sky this morning!  If the sky is clear (hopefully will be, sudden changes in the weather forecast, the bloody lyers) me and Bob will make our way across the Motorway bridge to the fields where there is hardly any visual disruption to block our view from all corners of the sky!  Anwyays, i'll post later in the daytime on what happened (if anything!)
