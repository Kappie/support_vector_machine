I nearly gave up running but something keeps flashing in my mind. You know what is it? Its her face but i don't know why i am doing these. because of her? i don't know. She was at the check point 7 but somehow i force myself not to look at her and quicken my peace to get away from her. Some how i wanted to find ways to hate her so that i can forget about her, but i juz can't. It is soo hard. As i was near the finishing line. My old injury get worsen. I had no choice but to force my way until the finishing line. Reaching the finishing line i got 20th position but my chest was so terrible hurt that i was not able to walk about so much for the next half an hour or so. I had trouble walking around or even standing up. I squard on the ground several times because the pain was so unbearable. At that time i was thinking of jumping into the sea and drown myself to end my suffering but i didn't. I picked myself up everytime the pain acted up again. Maybe that was what i deserve, the pain was a form of punishment for me. Some asked me if i would find another person and lead a new life. i said no cause i didn't want to and also i don't feel like to. The day ended quickly, i took a taxi home with one of my classmate.Just nice, a heavy downpour the moment i reach home. The following time of the day i went out to celebrate with my friends. His birthday was today, we had a lot of fun but some how i recall some sad memory also. Anyway i enjoy my day with them, they brighten up my life at the same time.
