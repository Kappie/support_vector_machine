Not only does it interfere with my configuration here, but it crashes  all   the   time .  Has anyone else experienced constant crashing with 9?  If so, drop me an  urlLink email , or just leave a comment.  Although I really love Winamp, I have recently gotten very tired of it (even though I do host my  urlLink radio  station with it).  As an alternative to both of these, I use Real Player Alternative (more properly known as "Classic Media Player").  I love it -- it's simple in design, but does it's job very well.  Not only does it act as a substitute for RealOne's wretched player, but it can also play MP3s, OGG files, and WMA (Windows Media) files.  It also has an excellent system of codecs for streaming radio.  If you are interested in getting Real Alternative (Classic Media Player), you can get it  urlLink here .  This is a direct-download link so you won't be confronted with the maker's site.  They also have an excellent Quick Tiime alternative  urlLink here .    I'm currently listening to " urlLink Word of God Speak " by MercyMe.
