I have not been out all day. this is because Kevin is a gimp and cannot haul his lazy tratter lovin' arse out of bed. and since Devon is going away, i have no one else to meet up with. BOOO!! I did go into town yesterday, and Kevi, Devon and I started dreaming. we dreamt of year 11, and remembered that a bunch of noobie year 7's (now yr 8's) were forming bands. Hilarious. We also had an idea. In year 11, we plan to organize a battle of the bands. And we plan to kick arse. I am the best guitarist in the school y'know (or so people tell me). so please, feel free to get a band together and participate in 2 years time, so we may mock and destroy you puny mortals. I also spotted a PA system we plan to purchase, a cool ass telecaster, and an amp. All of which are expensive. Skintness sucks.  Now back to the real world. Spent the whole day playing SOCOM II. I have been playing 1 day and I am already in a clan. WOotage. I am the pwn.   Later folks. Jams
