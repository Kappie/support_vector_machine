It had a reasonable plot for a superhero flick, stunning visuals, majestic music (props to Danny Elfman yet again) and far better than expected character development (a well done acting job by Toby Maguire). Yes the movie even surpassed the first as far as movie enjoyment goes. Yet somehow I still felt like I missed out on something. I think if it was anyother movie, I would have called it a great movie, but because this blockbuster is set to break almost every box office record for initial release, and probably has a shot at sitting high on the top-10 grossing films of all-times list (at least for now) I think I was expecting something more. Come to think of it, I felt the same way after the first Spiderman movie as well, around similar circumstances to it's release no less. So the question of the hour is: Did this movie deliver? Well, as great a movie as it may or may not have been, I think I was justified spending my $8 to see it (plus $4 for a drink), though I just think a movie this widely accepted should give me something more. I walked away like I had just seen the 2nd part of a trilogy (eg. The Two Towers, or The Empire Strikes Back) resigned to the fact that a year or two from now, I must spend another exhorbant amount of money in a theatre to see the next piece of this drama. Well perhaps that is what this movie was designed to do in the end. Perhaps this is more a commentary with my emotions linked to it speaking to the design of Hollywood to generate revenue rather than to truly entertain and fulfill. Or perhaps this really says that entertainment can ultimately never be fulfilling...... oooooohh...... That's deep! *laugh*  So on Sunday night after an odd set of circumstances at my church, and a rather envigorating sermon on sex (that broke the mold of church-types preaching and railing against sex as a dirty thing of the world) my lady and I engaged in some swing dance lessons. Oh my! Now I can dance per se, but I have never tried "real" dances with complicated steps (eg. swing, tango, cha-cha, etc). I can waltz, line dance and club to my heart's content, but this was something new to me. The 1-hour lesson went rather well, and then the floor was "open" for another couple of hours as the instructors filtered through music of various sorts in order for their students to practice their newly learnt steps. Well aside from one nasty incident of stepping on my partner's toes, the whole night was somewhat enjoyable, rather unique, and seemed to bring no end of delight to Jenny. Though I don't think I will become a dancer of any sort, now or ever, it remains to be seen if this is an activity that I can repeat from time to time just to break the monotony of my regular routine if anything.  Upon return, I had a quick bite, thanked my dear lady for working diligently to provide me with clean laundry, and tried to head to bed to be well rested for the morning. I had a great sleep I'm sure, and much longer than usual for me, but as had been the case for the last 4 mornings, I woke up totally exhausted and wanting to sleep more. As a matter of fact, today I did sleep more, and re-wokeup just 15 mins before I had to be in the office. Oy! Don't know what frustrated me more. The breaking of my morning routine, or the inability to shower properly before work. (I hate feeling dirty or grimy) Thus my evening is undoubtably going to contain a nice shower, some light cleaning at home, and hopefully some indulgence in my favorite video game at this point in time, which of course is none other than FFXI. (Final Fantasy XI for those of you uninitiated into the world of SquareSoft Inc.)  So upon reflection of my weekend, I find myself in an odd mood. Not that it was good, not that it was bad, not that it was empty, not that it was full. It was just unique. I look forward to having a bit more free time than usual this week (having no commitments other than being a youth sponsor with the youth group on wednesday) so perhaps my week upcoming will benefit. Although, I've been told idle hands are the devil's tools.....  Rooster
