(stretching so much)  Ha i was right, the first title to the shopaholic series is, the secret dreamworld of a shopaholic. I was actually arguing over a title? But guess what i feel real dumb not to have realised the book was released under two titles so, both titles were actually right.  School was the usual boring. After school i went back and guess what? i was actually practicing maths, not so much studious but more of scared out of my pants that i am going to top a fail for the coming exams.  Really weird isn't it? The exams coming up so soon? it felt like as if it were only a month ago that we were on Hols. I guess time does fly or it could be the sneaking system which hides and suddenly springs an exam on you! I think the latter.  Well hope the rest of you are starting revision and if you happen not to be in school anymore or are not having an exam anytime soon...well, envy.... Bully to you!  Love to you, and good luck, you're going to need it, i need a MIRACLE!!!
