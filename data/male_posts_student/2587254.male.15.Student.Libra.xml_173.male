In fact, after Wednesday, I won't have school for another 3 months....shweet =). So yeah....so far I've planned out following for summer:    -Volunteer @ Library for July -Chill w/ homies and homelies -Toronto in August -Canada's Wonderland w/ the 6crew and the usual people *you know who you are* -Anime Convention?   I doubt the last one I'll do...since I'm not that big of a fan of anime anyways. Sad...Melissa and Robert in my programming class already know more anime than me...and you know the stereotype of Asians liking anime....well I don't =P...except MT...and Chobits I guess I can tolerate a bit now.  But yeah...last day of school was pretty unproductive...but fun =P.  History and Civics we watched Shrek. Angela and some other person walked into civics for no reason and just sat there....whatever last day of school who cares =P. Final civics and history project got perfect, and civics exam I got 86%. SHWEET I MAY BE 85%+ AVERAGE STILL =). It all depends on english...come on don't go under 70 =). If it stays in 80...I almost have 90 average. GRRRRR.....  Lunch today....went to Jasper's one last time. Got a bagel and cream cheese to save money haha =P. It's actually pretty good. I can understand why white people like it for breakfast...it's actually good stuff. I like it now hehe. Hmm...it may be a breakfast thing next year =P. Kinda like coffee...cept parents seem to hate it.  Then math class. me still being hungry, I got some people *me, Saika and Mophead* to order a pizza. So the 3 of us went to call at a phone booth since reception blew downstairs. Ms. Davidson found it funny how "calling home" required three people. So in the end we ordered a cheese pizza from Pizza Pizza. Too bad it never came...blasted crap service. We even named the EXACT room. Room 114, London Central Secondary School. Mr. Gilbert really never knew what was happening till then end of class, when Nick warned him:  "Nice havin' ya for a teacher Mr. G. Oh yeah....if a pizza comes here tell him you're Mr. Freeman"  Hmm while waiting for the pizza, me, Jess and Maggie began lookin' at each other's cellphones. Whitaker has a sweet phone...it's the Sony Ericsson w/ the analog digital clock. It's kinda feminine phone though. Hmm....Courtney's charades game died pretty quickly....yeah math class was entertaining. A few people still did review..but yeah other than that nothing heh. Hmm next year I got chem and physics with Sarah Wild also found out, and music w/ Maggie also. So let's see...in music we've got Shaunvir, Christian, Leanna, Arjun, Kurtis, and Maggie...well that I know of. Hmm interesting. Surprises are always good =P.  Programming......only like 15 people so we did jack squat. Got tests back...87%,100%, and 96%. So programming mark is gonna skyrocket =). Hmm....yeah for the rest of the time just chatted with some people, and got to kinda know that 9er girl Monica that's in my programming class. Apparently she's really hyped up about marks...probably more than the average Asian @ Central....which is somewhat surprising. I say somewhat because that one "Asian Posse" is like "gangsta..." least they sure think so....HAHAHAHAHAHA that's funny. Anyways...  So school ended early today @ 1:30 for year end assembly. This year just many goodbyes to teachers, including our Principal Mr. Scanlon, Mr. Curphey *the ultimate science teacher,* and the infamous Mr. Krisak. Apparently Scanlon's a Christian, and Krisak seems to believe in a God. Found that kinda interesting. So the assembly had a few tears, lots of talkin', and farewell speeches. OH YEAH how could I forget. Mr. Endo's leaving too! I was looking forward to physics with him. He's our badminton coach also...but he is retiring. Ugh I don't want Doba for physics...football coach + physics? How did that ever work? Anyways, After the assembly...  Me, Mophead and Jason then headed down to Head 2 Head games for some gaming. Meh this is how I started Christmas holidays too lol. So gamed for 3 hours. Got owned in Empire Earth by compies, and BFV was fun like usual =P. Nothing as exciting as last time when the boats sank though...this time we actually played well and won =P. Grr...I really want a new comp now >_  TODAY WAS GRADUATION. WTH!? I THOUGH SCHOOL'S OVER! Well yeah for some reason they had some graduation thing today. THE ONE DAY WE CHOOSE TO PLAY BALL THEY HAVE GRAD. Ugh how ironic is that? So yeah we ended up going to my place...walking back since mom had to pick up dad since car was in shop. Got back home around 7pm...mom was kinda surprised we balled so quickly, so explained what happened. so PS2 for the time at my place, and compy. Not much since Jason had to leave an hour later.  So gave him a lift back, came back home, ate, did some other stuff...and here I am now. Joy, Gerts, and Jenn all find my water-noise thing that I make flicking my cheek pretty amusing. All of them got some laughs out of it hehe. Oh yeah also turns out the May Tang I met at the Orientation is ANOTHER May Tang...so different one from the one on my MSN list haha.  Anyways I'm out for the night. Gotta study for some bio, maybe math, and hit the hay. Gotta wake up at 9 tomorrow to do worship practice with Carmie and Gavin. Hmm...oh yeah tomorrow Lina and Josh comin' over too for "mad" bio studying. Then HYPE hehe. Later people....and have a good summer to all! =).
