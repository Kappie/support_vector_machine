You close your eyes  and leave me naked by your side  You close the door so I can't see  The love you keep inside  The love you keep for me   It fills me up  It feels like living in a dream  It fills me up so  I can't see  The love you keep inside  The love you keep for me   I stay to watch you fade away  I dream of you tonight  Tomorrow you'll be gone  It gives me time to stayto watch you fade away  I dream of you tonight  Tomorrow you'll be gone  I wish by God you'd stay   I stay awake  I stay awake and watch you breathe  I stay awake and watch you flyaway into the night  Escaping through a dream   I stay to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight  Tomorrow you'll be gone  It gives me time to stay to watch you fade away  I dream of you tonight    Tomorrow you'll be gone  I wish by God you'd stay    - Sabyia: The second you sleep
