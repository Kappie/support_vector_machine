She asked me why not? I ended up explaining it to Jacs. If I asked her out she would most likely say no, in which case everything would stay the way it is now, me having a thing for her, nd her not caring. But if she did say yes, wot then? I wouldn't know what to do - having never been in a real relationship before - and I would just be a bag of nerves. I know I wont make a good boyfriend, and thats why not. I'm much better at being peoples friends.
