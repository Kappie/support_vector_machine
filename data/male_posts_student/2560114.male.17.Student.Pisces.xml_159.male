Then we all went to the pepperdine game, wit the addition of annaliza, and yeah...off we went. The game was very awesome cuz hawaii won...w00t!...they kicked pepperdinez ass in 3 gamez and yeah, it was bitchin. Then afta the game i spotted my fair share of hot chicz and then met up wit alfred and his folkz. Then we went to santa monica wit alfred, his famzleh, his friendz, and that one tall guy, #16, that was on his team. On the boardwalk at s.m. there were all kindz of sitez to c, and it was some good stuff. Then we all ate at cpk and it was pretty coo to meet all of these ppl, alfred'z dad thought annaliza was my g/f, which was some funny stuff, hahaha.
