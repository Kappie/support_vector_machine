I think I may have stumbled on some cool ideas. I found out that it actually costs money to patent inventions. I will have to save some money to pay a patent lawyer to draw up the correct paperwork and let the lawyer submit them. If all goes according to my plan, nothing ever does, I could make a nice chunk of side change.
