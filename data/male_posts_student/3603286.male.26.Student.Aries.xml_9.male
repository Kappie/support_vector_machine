If I have to explain what being sensible means then you will not understand the answer.   Protecting yourself is easy - Think of a pink bubble surrounding yourself. Remember that this bubble needs to include front, back, sides, top and bottom (and if you are aware of it then also your astral form). Be aware that this bubble will protect you. Do this every day.   It takes a couple of weeks for this form of protection to come into effect, but the more you use it the stronger it gets.
