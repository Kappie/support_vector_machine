GO ME!!! You know what the temp is there?!?!?! 60 degrees!!  That's 40 degrees more than here here, losers!!! *Evil Laugh* MUHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  I feel good, but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna forget sumthing.....poo on you memory..... Ya, I was really hyper today, but then second block fixed that, I don't know why though....oh ya...maybe it's the fact that my group didn't let me DO ANYTHING!!! damn them........and during first block I fell asleep and was snoring kinda, so I got poked, and people were reading their favorite childrens stories...I felt bad because it was like I didn't kare...but it was just so DAMN peaceful!!! What else happened today....uh.....a rabid black man broke into my house and was typing things on my computer...but I drove him...he didn't speak an ounce of English and it was quite scary..but I showed him who was boss!!  w00t!  Uh...other than that, today was pretty uneventful....hm.....nope..can't think of anything.....besides the fact that I luv DDR more every day.....Peace!  Spense
