And why do you say that I need to feel The hand of God, a spiritual ideal I don't know why you can't believe in us When this relationship is based on trust And just because we see in different lights It doesn't mean we can't go to new heights You are the one that need enlightenment Please realize I'm writing this just to vent Just listen please, it's you I love But this is not the kind that's from above Because this love is much more than a cliche Look back. Remember once upon a day When we were once ecstatic way back when The sound your voice would make would chill my skin But that's all gone please leave, go and think Of how we were over in a small blink A blink that lasted life times worth of pain Reminded me of the beauty of rain Remember this to thine own self be true And maybe, maybe on day I'll come back to you.  That one sucked too...and sounded alot like the "alone" one, but it was another of those write at 2 in the morning thing...i guess i think i ended a relationship early in the morning. Weird huh?
