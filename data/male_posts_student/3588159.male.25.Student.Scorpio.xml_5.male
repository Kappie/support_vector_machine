           
         This one's just for fun because it's late.    I drink milk and honey in my coffee; it’s my taste of the promised land. Keeps my bleary eyes open to see–- maybe there are still springs in the sand.  So the cream and gold amid the black keep my eyes open to behold a pillar of flame, iridescent cloud at my back and a watered garden from a mountain peak...before I get too old.  Still there are answers my imbibed alacrity can’t find–- Does my pathway end at this scenic mountain wall? Or does it crest the proffered overlook and fall? Will I ever enter Canaan…before I lose my body, soul and mind?    © 2004 Ariel Vanderhorst
