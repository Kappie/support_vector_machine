Sorry but she's most of what you'll hear about for the next couple of of weeks, or until we are done the break and decided what we're doing. I miss her so much. I never realized how important she was and how much I loved her until now. I know it's hard to believe, but I was the biggest jerk to Brittany on Friday. If I could, I would spend the rest of my life making it up to her.  Brittany if you are reading this, I love you so much, and I can't stand being without you. I am sorry about what a jerk I have been to you. If I could, I would spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Please forgive me. I hope we can give our relationship another try. (Sorry for the Backstreet Boys quote, but it's perfect for how I feel):  "It's not that I can't live without you, it's not that I don't even want to try. Every night I dream about you, ever since the day we said goodbye. If I wasn't such a fool, right now I'd be holding you. There's nothing that I wouldn't do, Baby, if I only knew... The words to say, the road to take, to find a way back to your heart. What can I do to get to you? To find a way back to your heart.  I don't know how it got so crazy, but I'll do anything to set things right. Cause your love is so amazing. Baby, you're the best thing in my life. Let me prove my love is real, and make you feel the way I feel. I promise I would give the world, if only you would tell me, Girl... The words to say, the road to take, to find a way back to your heart. What can I do to get to you? To find a way back to your heart. Give me one more chance to give my love to you. Cause no one on this earth loves you like I do. Tell me the words to say, the road to take, to find a way back to your heart. What can I do to get to you? To find a way back to your heart. I'd turn back time to make you mine and find a way back to your heart. I'd beg and plead, fall to my knees, to find a way back to your heart."  I know it's sad, but I have been listening to nothing but sappy music, because it makes me feel better. I don't know why. Lately, I have even been a Backstreet Boys mood., and they used to annoy me. I guess I empathize with the songs? I know it's sad. My cousins April and Nicole used to listen to Backstreet Boys all the time, and I used to hang out with them a lot, so I know all of their songs by heart, even the old ones. It's so weird. But either way, I know it's sad, but I miss her so much. At least the songs I am listening to are for a good cause. Look at my away messages and you can see the kind of messages I am trying to portray to her. Every away message is a message to her in some way or another. Look closely sometime.   Anyway, on to another subject, so there is some variety here. Yesterday our bus broke down so we were late to school because the bus was late picking us up. Today we had a new bus and our bus driver had a substitute (not our normal bus driver), so Greg, a Christian on my bus, and I were joking that yesterday our bus broke and today our driver broke. I guess you'd have to be there.   I have to change my unkymood. I will do that tonight. It says, "Fired up," but I need to find something like sad, broken hearted, or depressed, so you can see how I really feel. I'm sure they have all of them. I'll pick the best one to how I feel. Either way, I am some version of melancholy because of how bad I have made my life recently. The only person who can make it better now is God. I am praying that His will is done and then whatever happens He will make me happy with it, and that He would do what would make me happiest, though more and more I think that is getting Brittany back. I would in turn make her happier than she has ever been.... like it used to be until about two months ago.   Sorry, I said I would change the subject, but she is all I can think about. She told me to just relax and stop worrying because everything would be okay and we will always be close, but if I can't be with her, it won't be okay. I'll always know I blew a great thing, and hate myself. Even if we can work it out, I will have a hard time forgiving myself for Friday. I know I can trust her, and I knew I was making a mistake, but I was the biggest jerk anyway, and I knew I would regret it. And I do. I wish I could turn back time, as impossible as it may seem.   Either way, I know that my life will turn out okay. It depends on whose hands it is in. Like I heard it said:        A basketball in my hands is worth about $19. A basketball in Michael Jordan's hands is worth about $33 million. It depends whose hands it's in.         A baseball in my hands is worth about $6. A baseball in Mark McGuire's hands is worth $19 million. It depends on whose hands it's in.         A tennis racket is useless in my hands. A tennis racket in Venus Williams' hands is a championship winning. It depends whose hands it's in.         A rod in my hands will keep away a wild animal. A rod in Moses' hands will part the mighty sea. It depends whose hands it's in.         A sling shot in my hands is a kid's toy A sling shot in David's hand is a mighty weapon. It depends whose hands it's in.        Two fish and five loaves of bread in my hands is a couple of fish sandwiches. Two fish and five loaves of bread in God's hands will feed thousands. It depends whose hands it's in.         Nails in my hands might produce a birdhouse. Nails in Jesus Christ's hands will  produce salvation for the entire world. It depends whose hands it's in.         As you see now it depends whose hands it's in. So I put my concerns, worries,  fears, hopes, dreams, family and relationships in God's hands because... It depends whose hands it's in.                                         And that is so true!!!!!                                       (Look Kari, no 1's!!!!)  Okay, now I can explain that. Kari, my penpal and one of my best friends, always puts excitement online by putting an infinite amount of exclamation points after what she said, like when she greets me on AIM, "MIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" When she does that, sometimes she lifts up off of SHIFT too early and it's left like this: "MIKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1" and that's what i see on the IM when she is rushing. It's sort of an inside joke to Kari, Dan Mott, Kendra, me, and some other people.   Anyway, I'm getting bored and there is too much heartache inside me right now, so I am going to go. If you care about me, please give me a call if you know the number. If you don't know it, IM me and find it out. I really would enjoy a call from my friends right now. You all know if you were feeling bad, I would do the same thing. I need to keep in touch with you all better anyway. Blog you later!  In Christ, Mike >
