Yes sometimes I have total disregard for the feelings of others, but it's merely me feeling that it's better to be honest in the giving of my opinion.  It was nice to get out. Too bad I think I purchased some cheap ass tequila which resulted in some nausea this morning.  I got a call from Esther last night and talked to Steff this afternoon. It's nice to chat with my homegirls back in SoCal.  I had breakfast for dinner - hashbrowns with onion and green bell pepper, and a spinach and mushroom omlette. I'm almost out of orange juice, which is a bummer.  I plan on making some chicken quesadillas tomorrow and chicken soup (from scratch).  Speaking of food, I read about 40 pages of Gary Fine's book on kitchens. Interesting stuff.  I watched  Empire Records  tonight too. I wanna go back to freshman year of high school and remember the tunes from that era now.  ***
