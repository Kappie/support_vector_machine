I had stats at 9:30 AM, then stats lab, then a meeting with my professor for 192w. Then after going to the bank and getting gas, I went up to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Herrick library in Beverly Hills.  I can't believe someone checked out the  Blockade  script. I did manage to get some research done there. It was kind of cool there. I need to give them a call to see if they have the periodicals I need to take a look at.  I majorly got lost at UCLA! That really drained me... Special collections was closed by the time I got there, but I got some useful info.  ***
