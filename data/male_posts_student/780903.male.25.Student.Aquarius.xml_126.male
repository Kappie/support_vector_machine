It wasn't terrible, and actually pretty interesting -- if contrived but well-done movies about teachers and students are your cup of tea.  Not as good as Finding Forrester or Good Will Hunting, but not awful by any stretch.  The biggest problem I had was its predictability.  Every plot point was telegraphed a few minutes in advance and set up such that nothing was a surprise.  The most glaring example (and I'm really not giving anything away here) was that at one point in the movie, the students persuade the teacher to join them in a game of baseball, the pitcher convinced he'll strike him out without a problem.  Just then, the headmaster pulls up, across the courtyard, in his automobile.  Camera focus on the driver's side window.  I don't need to continue.  It's the attempted emotional manipulation of "Stepmom" combined with the "there's-a-deeper-meaning-here" of "Field of Dreams."  So if that sounds like something that wouldn't put you to sleep, I recommend it.
