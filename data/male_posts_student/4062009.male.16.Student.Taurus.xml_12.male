Other then that, my day is like any other day. Just going to school, coming home and relaxing, only to end up doing homework again. LOL! I am looking forward to watching Family Guy tonight though, like every night now. Anything on Adult Swim I pretty much like to watch except Big O and this new show i think is coming on. I forget the name. Anyway, thats it for my day. Well, later!     Wolfwood
