He fed about 10 people and all of us were amazed at how much effort he put into it. John Abraham brought over some Knob Creek bourbon too, very good stuff. At midnight we all went out to the Flying Saucer down at Sundance Square. All of us were pressuring Molini to get a tatoo. She's the most straight-laced, level headed person among us, so it was funny...you just had to be there.   Today I'm meeting with my folks at the Gaylord Texan Hotel. It's this new place that opened up that's supposed to be one of the nicest places in the Southwest. I guess I am getting older when I look forward to spending some time with my folks. Man, just 5 years ago I couldn't wait to be 1,200 miles away from them. Anyway, I need to start packing.   A local radio station is doing all 80's all weekend. Certain 80's rock can be very cheezy, granted, but it's unlike any other kind of music and it's great for when you just want to forget everything else going on. My songs of the day reflect my appreciation for the phenom that is 80's music.    Songs of the day   The Boys of Summer , Don Henley, 1984.  Every Breath You Take , The Police, 1983.  Your Love , The Outfield, 1985.   Pour Some Sugar On Me , Def Leppard, 1987.   If You Leave , OMD, 1988.
