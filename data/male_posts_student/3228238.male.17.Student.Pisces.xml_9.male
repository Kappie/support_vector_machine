Kepler, combining math and astronomy, expanded the theory of celestial harmony with the 3 Laws of Planetary Motion.  He discovered a geometric relationship between the six planets, know at that time (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), with the sun.    Pythagoras is credited for discovering the relationship of musical notes to a scale.  The pitches could be identified by the ratios of vibration frequency and string length.  For example, any note in relationship to the same note in another octave will have a same ratio of 1:2.  In the same way, a perfect fifth has a ratio of 2:3.  The 1st Law of Planetary Motion states that planets move not in perfect circles, but rather ellipses, with the sun at the center.  There are two distinct points on the ellipse; the perihelion and the aphelion.  The perihelion is the closest point to the sun and the aphelion is farthest point from the sun.  The 2nd Law of Planetary Motion states that the planets move with a faster velocity at the perihelion and with a slower velocity at the aphelion.  Kepler measured the elliptical velocities of each planet’s perihelion vs. aphelion, and each had ratios in close agreement with musical intervals.  Next, he combined different planets’ perihelions with aphelions and found that the ratios of the planets completed steps of a musical scale.  Because the planets move around their orbits, between the perihelion and the aphelion, there are constantly changing polyphonic chords.  (The 3rd Law of Planetary Motion states that there is a relationship between each planet’s distance from the sun and the amount of time it takes to conclude an orbit.)  The comparison of mathematical relationships between the celestial heavens and the very essence of music are phenomenal.  It is clearly no coincidence that God creates marvels for us to contemplate.  Although the “spheres’ of this galaxy do not truly make any music for our simple human ears to hear, it’s interesting to think of what it would sound like if they really did.
