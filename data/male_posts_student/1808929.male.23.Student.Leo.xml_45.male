Each of us had different expectations, and different overall impressions of this place, but we all wanted desperately to have some fun before the realities of second-year medical school set in. John Abraham, Joey Heitzman, and Omar Villanueva are the three guys who traveled with me to Vegas; I came to know each of these guys during the last year, but we really had very little shared experiences. I’m very glad that this trip has given us something to talk and laugh about when times get tough in the next few months.   John, our blackjack expert, is probably the most vocal and extroverted of our group. His energy, humor, and ability to communicate well thought-out ideas make him a very successful conversationalist. He’s also very adept at studying personality types, for I learned more about the people in our medical school class just by talking with John than from my own knowledge. On many occasions I felt that he carried our group from one Las Vegas encounter to the next. He pretty much figured out most of our social agenda, which worked out well since he had been in Vegas only three months earlier. I’m not sure why, but John recommended that I listen to Stevie Wonder. I think his suggestion had something to do with helping me to quell my bad mood (at the time).   Joey, the slots-master, is also very extroverted, but on top of that I’d say he has a knack for witty conversation and sense of style. Joey has been living right across the hall from me for about a year now, but until this trip I didn’t realize how truly funny he really is. John and Omar bring out this side of Joey; it’s amazing to me how John and Joey have such control over the mood of our group. Joey’s sense of style is impeccable; he likes very nice, expensive things. I have a very difficult time relating to some of these values, but I try to respect them.   Omar, who doesn’t gamble, yet still won $30 is a very considerate, perceptive friend. He always senses when something is wrong and wants to help resolve problems. I’ve spent the most time with Omar in the past year, but recently I’ve lost touch with him sense he started dating a mutual friend of ours. Omar didn’t particularly like Las Vegas. I originally thought that Vegas had something for everybody, but I guess I was mistaken. Also, Omar does not drink. This personal choice has sometimes come between Omar and myself, but I have to admire his noble ability to find enjoyment without alcohol.    As we left Vegas today I think we could all sense that it was time for us to spend some time apart, for five straight days of the same people can wear on a person. However, as I drove home in the silence of my own car I actually started feeling a little lonely. All those fun days and nights had gone by so quickly that I even failed to really recognize the fun I was having. I miss it already. Vegas, though excessively materialistic, commercial, gaudy, and crowded is the place for making and building new friendships based on shared experiences that can’t be replicated anywhere else.
