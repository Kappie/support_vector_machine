I think i kinda made myself have a good day, i relaxed alot at home and actually played hard at tennis (ya know releasing those endorphins lol).  A good day is a good day though.  i think im going to go to bed early again like i have been, it has been very good for me getting at least 9 hrs everynight.  i like it :).    ps- teaching math to ppl who dont enjoy math is difficult lol it sure takes patience but i have to learn it somewhere :P (u know i love ya!)  g'night everyone have a wonderful day tom!
