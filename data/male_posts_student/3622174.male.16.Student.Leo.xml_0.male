I picked it up for my Xbox today, and the game is so much fun, that I don't think I've had this kind of experience in a game.  This game really is that good.  Of course, you play the calm, quiet Peter Parker...wait, calm?  Quiet?  Eh...I think I misjudged.  Peter is always out and about, skipping classes, ditching his friends, for one main purpose.  And that is to save New York City from villains, crooks, and bad guys.  The game is broken up into several "chapters," in which you must complete.  In each chapter are goals that you must accomplish to complete the chapter.  The goals may be challenging at some time (like the Rhino boss...he took me 4 tries or so to get him finished), but, let me tell you, it's all worth it.  This has to be the best Xbox game I have played in such a long time.  It's perfect for anyone who has ever seen either the first or second movies.    The graphics in the game are beautiful.  Activision decided to make this one with open ended game play, so that you can sling all around New York City.  And, New York City, by the way, has been very well recreated, with the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, and even two beams of light at Ground Zero.  It looks so much like the real city, that you won't know you're playing a videogame.  Its that much fun.  Slinging around has never been better.  You can select either Easy Slinging or Normal Slinging.  Normal is the better option to go with if you want the full experience of the game.  You can sling from building to building, rooftop to rooftop, and have as much fun as you want.  It sure beats traveling on foot, right?    So anyway, I've only come across the first boss at this point, but, as I continue to play it, I'm going to come across much more, and I know they are going to be very tough.  Stick around, because this Saturday, I'll be giving a full review. ------------------ Daily Wrap Up- June 30, 2004  Well, that's it for today's installments of bagel.tech.  I deviated from the original plan quite a bit, but, it was definitely worth it.  Here's what happened today:  In games I looked at Collapse.  This game is addicting, and it may give you Clickeritis, but, it's one of the most fun games I have played.  I gave Collapse an 87.5 (on the new scale).  For today's download, we looked at WinAmp 5.1.  This media player is nice, and it's got some sweet features, like being able to download skins that make the original look like a load of crap.  I gave WinAmp an 87.5.  And, today's site of the day, also earned an 87.5, and that is a site known as IGN.  User interaction is what makes this site great, you can post your game collection, wishlist, and all sorts of stuff.  Again, it got an 87.5.  So, we didn't look at the best of things today, but, it was still a good day.  Here's what to expect tomorrow...and remember, it can change:  GAME: What Word? DOWNLOAD: Avant Browser SITE: TBA FEATURE: bagel.tech WAR: WinAmp vs. jetAudio  Remember, the new rating scale begins tomorrow, and the monthly review archive is going to be deleted and started fresh for the new month.  That's it for today's installments.  Remember to check out Blog of Bagel tonight, where I'll be beginning the countdown for my favorite Family Guy episodes, and another update which will have me rambling about my new favorite game.  Until then, leave me alone!  I'm playing Spiderman 2!
