I think I'm gonna turn out to be one of those caffeine addicts soon. Well not much happened at school today. Same as usual.....history,careers, math, then comps. REAL boring. Slept through most of 2nd half of day. Wow.....we get notified about exams.....who cares.........school is so boring right now.  Well while doing my stupid english project, I learned a few interesting things. One, since im doing the Chinese Communist revolution, I found out that Mao somehow thought there was a government called "Democracy Dictatorship."   Well yeah today was pretty frickin boring. I came home and played one of the longest games ever on SC with Jason. Josh did play but he went to play gunbound after a while. I still can't figure how the heck a game like gunbound can be so addictive. It's like that old school game scorched earth, but with better graphics and you can actually see the difference between a tank and a walking doo hicky thing. Weird. I think I'll stick with my tea drinking here............if i had coffee wow life would be much better.  Well Imma head out now......gotta do a crapload of bio crap still...........so yah and i wanna sleep 2nite.....try to get more than 6 hours.
