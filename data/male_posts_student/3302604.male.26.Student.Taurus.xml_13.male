I don't know what it is, but I've been trying to get onto this website for my course in various different ways for two days now and every time the damn thing just stop loading. Every damn time. AAARGH!  Anyway, yesterday was abit of non event really. We are now starting to get our results back from the middle of term tests, but I'm really not interested as they seem to be exactly the same as they always are.

We slog our guts out to learn for three tests, plan a lesson and get an essay in in the  same week . What does it turn out that our education tutor says  'Oh, dear.

It's nice to see our licence fee is being spent wisely.  Don't you love terrestrial programming  Jack
