Went to the hall instead of the classroom for morning assembly. guess there's some important announcement for us to listen to or some other  important  stuff. true enough, we had community singing. "national day is coming yakyakyak let's practice some community singing.. yakyakyakya"    Come on, it's just some  singing.  singing of songs which we have sung for perhaps 4years already? there's no need for us to  practice  singing  them  isn't? haha. thank goodness first period was cme. we can afford to "eat" the time. Cme Pccg Poa Poa Mt Mt Recess Geog FT Amaths Geog.    Nothing much for Poa. topic was easy. limited companies.deferred shares.ordinary shares.perference shares... POOF "Well, we have covered the whole syllabus for your accounts..."    Mt lessons were free periods for us. used the time to finish up my Geog tourism mindmap. others, as usual, used the time for ..*ahem* (huàt là!)       Geog lessons were interesting. Interesting not because HIB made it interesting. We were asking each others lame questions throughout the whole lesson. haha. HIB had a sore throat. almost lost her voice? Just  hope  that she would be smart enough to take medical leave on hmm.. Thrusday. Then hopefully she would recover on Friday and go to school for national day celebration! Haha. Thoughtful. (actually i'm having a presentation on thrusday. so if she's not in school on thrusday, then.. *evil smile*) Amaths was.. erm..  able-to-understand  the chapter relative velocity. Just a couple of practices and i think i should be able to understand the chapter well.    PCCG. taught us how to ah.. couldn't really remember what the lesson was about. "Worry time: Spend about 15 to 30minutes to worry about.. anything you wanna worry about. Studies, life etc. Then you will find that the worries will not be bugging you therfore, you would be able to concertrate/focus more while doing homework or revising for exams." Aha. another one was about "Be here now." If your mind starts to wander off when you are doing homework or revising, then tell yourself "Be here now." Try it. You will find that blah blah blah blah..   Finished my Poa homework one the bus. What a great achievement! *A pat on my back please. =D       Time to do my homework. Let's hope it  rains  again tomorrow morning.   yt™
