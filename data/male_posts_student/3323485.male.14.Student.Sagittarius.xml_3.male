I was walking around, minding my own buisiness, and a bunch of 4+ year 8s appeared from nowhere and started pissing about with me. All I did was call one of them a 'stupid git' and it got dirty. I wont go into the details, bot there was 4+ of them, 1 of me and they were bigger, so you can guess the rest. Just before it got bad, two teachers appeared from nowhere.   I never thought I would  ever  hear myself say this, but thank god for teachers!
