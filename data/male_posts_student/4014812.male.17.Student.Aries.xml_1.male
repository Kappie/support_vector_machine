So then i just kinda focused out everyone on msn (im so sorry). But later at night when me and James played warcraft i forgot all my troubles (hurray for James). yup... i didnt do anything... cept watched my parents pack up for camping... STILL LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TODO BTW!... no one has contacted me except Ashley.. to goto a movie... i dont think thats gonna happen cuz they usually dont have their shit together lol.      Yeah ima go sleep now good day
