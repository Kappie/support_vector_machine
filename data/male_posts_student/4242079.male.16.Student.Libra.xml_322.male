I was getting a little bored, so I started wandering around Chapters, looking at various books and magazines. I picked up this months issue of "Skeptical Enquirer" for two reasons. The first, this months theme is religion based, on whether or not God is real, which is an issue that interests me greatly. But we'll get into that later. The second reason I bought it, is because my friend Bryce Williams wrote a letter to the editor which was actually published in this issue. It is all rather exciting.  Robyn showed up and we hurried out of Starbucks because that place was crazy busy this afternoon. After wandering around the mall aimlessly for a while, we headed to one of the local theatres to see "The Secret Window". It is a good movie. Not one of my all time favorites, but I will see it again, for sure.  After the movie got out, I drove to Tim Hortons, where we talked casually about my (fictional) gay relationship with a man named John, his drug dealing, trial, prison time, and how it all affects our eight year old daughter, Maya. For further insight into that, read today's "Dear Abby". Also included in the conversation were teenage lesbianism and the benifits of pillow fights.  Then, just as we were leaving, the worst thing happened! Robyn walked right smack into a truck! It was partially my fault, for distracting her with my intelligent conversation, and as it was driving by, she stepped off the curb and walked right into it!   Alternate (and true) Ending   Then, I drove her home.   The end.
