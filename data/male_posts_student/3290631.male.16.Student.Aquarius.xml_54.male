We had a creative writing assignment for homework to write about what our memories of this time in our lives would be, ten years from now.  And I wrote some stupid thing, I couldn't really think of anything.  So this girl stands up to read hers in front of the class.  Her name is Asia, and she talks to me a lot, some guy named Dante told me she liked me but Asia never came out and said it.  Anyways, I'm looking down at my desk reading something, not paying much attention when I look up a few minutes into her reading and everyone in the class is looking back at me.  Then Manny (another kid in the class) whispers, "She's reading about you."  I immediately started to listen and she said all kinds of things about me being unique, and intelligent, and not caring what people think about me, and about how she loves talking to me to listen to all the great things I have to say.  Needless to say, I was mortified.  I never brought it up with Asia for two reasons, it made me extremely uncomfortable, and I figured it would make her feel uncomfortable too.  I felt like a jerk either way.  Michael (my therapist) says, "You have to learn how to accept flowers."  He was alluding to a metaphorical story that he had just told me about the first time a girl gave him flowers.  That made me feel better but one thing is for sure, Asia has got some balls of steel to read something like that in front of an entire English class.  Later on I asked someone what made them so sure it was written about me and they told me that the title of her writing assignment was "Angel."  Boy that was long.
