We went to lodi to pick up jeremy christmas eve and we opened presents there. I landed a propane stove and light, beard trimmer, a longsleeve shirt with monkeys, and a tree ordament. We came back to the casa is sr and opened more presents with mimi's mom. There I landed a case of Beers around the world. It had twelve different kinds of beers from around the uh world. Very rad. I also got a little red toy vespa, some food stuff for the kitchen, and a beautiful card from mimi that made me cry. I seriously was not in the spirit of getting. I was really enjoying watching everyone unwraping their gifts. I thought that was neat. So anyways, I spent all christmas day working on jeremy's computer. I got it loaded up good now. After that we drove by the santa rosa, healdsburg, and petaluma skateparks to check them over. Very rad. After that I help jeremy with a website and we listened to load music late into the night.  Now I have to go to work and do nothing becuase I doubt anyone is gonna be shopping after christmas while it's raining. I did get a call from Legacy Marketing Group and they want to do a face to face interview! Horrrraaayyy!!!
