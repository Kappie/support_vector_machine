I watched " urlLink Secondhand Lions " today -- it is a HILARIOUS movie starring Michael Cain (my favorite actor), and Robert Duvall....  Watch it TODAY.  You won't be sorry...  If you have a DVD playing medium, get the DVD -- it's much better.  It came out in 2003 (September), amazingly - I haven't seen it until now!
