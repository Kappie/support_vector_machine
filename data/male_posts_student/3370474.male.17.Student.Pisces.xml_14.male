It was hard, I thought I would never be able to silence their screaming voices, but alas, I have.  With the help of certain people, I have vanquished these demons from my mind and have set myself free.  I have never been so happy in my life, and from this day forth, I promise to be everything you ever wanted me to be Sarah.  From now on, I am happy.  I am free.
