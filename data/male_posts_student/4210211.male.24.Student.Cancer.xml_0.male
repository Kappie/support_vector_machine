In front of us are some boisterous boys talking about their evening's exploits, and one of them comes out with "she totally wanted to give you a blow job." Josh, walking only a few feet back, answers as only Josh can, "no she didn't."  They were decent sized guys, not big, but bigger than Josh and I, and there were four of them. Luckily, only the one behind looked back to see us snickering, and I don't think he heard what Josh had said.
