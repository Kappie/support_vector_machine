While I think publishing is something I'm very interested in, I am NOT interested in sticking around Champaign anymore.  Though air conditioning and a nice apartment could change some of my perceptions.  The locals, will not change.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.    The downside of the emails I sent out comes in the form of Buddy Holly getting a forwarded email...One, I doubt she'd respond to the email and two, wow, wouldn't that be a fabulous work situation.  I'm coming to realize as well that I might have to do an internship if I want to go the route of PR/Media/Marketing stuff.  Which would suck because I want REAL MONEY, REAL HEALTH INSURENCE, and a REAL PLACE.  But I guess I could gut it out for a few months if the payoff down the road is a job offer.  Its just I would want the job upfront.  However, nothing is done or set in stone.   post script A year ago today I met Billy Corgan, which means I'm better than you.
