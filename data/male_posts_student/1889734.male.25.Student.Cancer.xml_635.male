Apple responded to my problem by allowing me to download ALL of the music I have purchased to date, with the 'warning' that this is a one time exemption.  Fair enough.  If I had bought a CD from Best Buy and snapped it in half, I can't very well expect them to replace it, right?  We need to get over this thinking that digital data is unlike any other product.  Just because I CAN copy it ad infinitum ad naueseum doesn't mean that I SHOULD, or that I have the RIGHT to do it.  Apple has reasonable restrictions on these files, and they do not inconvenience me at all.  I can still burn all the Audio CDs I want.  I can copy them to other computers, but only three machines at a time can be authorized to play them.  And of course there is the iPod, which doesn't count.  About the only thing I can't do is email a compressed file to a friend.  I'm free to burn it as a CD format and do what I please though.  (Technically, I can only burn a playlist 10 times, but then I can simply move a song to a new position on the list and get 10 more burns, so it's really a token restriction).  So in short, I'm still happy with my decision to go legit.
