I'm getting all confused now. What is love? There must be an absolute. But all views seem so acceptable. Then what is true love? Thanks Adrian. I agree. It's our own selfishness that makes love painful. If we love, we would do things and make sacrifices for the person with joy. But as Dustin said, God does feel painful when we sin against him doesn't it? He loves us. And because of that He did so much for us. But does He feel pain? But I would not question God's love, cause His is the greatest love. Love that can't be more true. So what is love? My first understanding of love was Mommy...but as time passes, it gets all complicated and difficult to understand...Lord, help me understand... Anyway, I agree with Adrian in some way. I realise my own selfishness now. Thanks Adrian! Thanks Min too! or always dropping by. I should expect more people around now. Now that Dustin added a link to his blog. But all are welcomed!
