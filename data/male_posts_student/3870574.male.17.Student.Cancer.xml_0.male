At the end of the movie, he talks about the selflessness of our troops even though early in the movie, Moore makes fun of our young guys playing songs like "Let the Bodies Hit the Floor" in their tanks while they put their life on the line.  To further demonstrate his patriotism, he posts this on his website:  "The Iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not "insurgents" or "terrorists" or "The Enemy." They are the REVOLUTION, the Minutemen, and their numbers will grow -- and they will win."  http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-04-14  Some support of our country, Mike.  As for United Nations help?  "There is a lot of talk amongst Bush's opponents that we should turn this war over to the United Nations. Why should the other countries of this world, countries who tried to talk us out of this folly, now have to clean up our mess? I oppose the U.N. or anyone else risking the lives of their citizens to extract us from our debacle. I'm sorry, but the majority of Americans supported this war once it began and, sadly, that majority must now sacrifice their children until enough blood has been let that maybe -- just maybe -- God and the Iraqi people will forgive us in the end. "  It is a sad day in American politics that when your level of political "dissent" reaches as far as predicting and wanting the enemy of our soldiers to win. The worst part? Michael Moore is not off base in the eyes of the Democratic Party and many of their members. Hate our President Mike, but don't hate our troops.
