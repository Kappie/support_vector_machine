So, I have uploaded the tutorial as an  HTML file, but as a result of this some of the formatting has been  lost. The link to the tutorial is:  http://www.expungedcore.net/mattm/me/ltutor.html .  Also I have finally drafted the Cultural Enhancement Act 2004  that--because of its very nature of extending and codifying the  President's cultural authority in Amendment One of the  Constitution--needs to be approved by the President into law. The link  to the draft is:  file:///Users/matthewm/Documents/Lavalon/cultureAct.html . As far as  the future of Lavalon goes, this is important legislation. It restores  some of the traditions of the Sovereign Principality, and provides a  way to encourage new ones. There is a provision for a "Lavalon Day", as  well.  And, if you want to see what the Cultural Enhancement Act will offer  immediately..take a look at the University of Lavalon page:  http://www.expungedcore.net/mattm/me/college.html .
