Ugh this week has been filled with many ups and downs, but I'm just happy right now that my week is over and a new one is about to start around the corner =). So now life is much easier, without the bothersomes of band, I can sleep in until 720am every morning now heeheehee! Haha so Jenn's all alone now with waking up that early. Least she finishes school earlier than most of us...lucky bum.  So my day started off at 720am like usual, and got ready and stuff and left the house around 750. Got to school around 810 and when I walk into history...yes I realize that I did my essay somewhat wrong. Apparently we had to cite EVERYTHING and not just quotes....so yeah I'm gonna lose a few marks on that essay which sucks =(. I still don't get how my history mark dropped 8% from two assignments, so yeah I gotta ask about that next day. Today though we had our first presentation. Maisie and her 50's group did their presentation today, which wasn't half bad. Hmm after history...came civics...  Took up some of the exam....but Ms. Manson still has to mark the essays. So for the rest of the year....we have to do some project about us being a political party. I got stuck into a group w/ Hammond, Dave, Lindsay, Brittany, and Melinda. I dunno what they really did....since I had to go get ready for the spring teams assembly or w/e....which replaced MOGA....which is really gay how that happened....so after 40 minutes of class me, Dave and Pokan got to leave early for the Spring teams assembly. Yes apparently badminton was on the roster this year =).  So we got photos taken, the assembly was pretty lame...yup and lunch came.  Mike John and I went to Stobie's today. Heh haven't had pizza in a while....and I don't regret going to Stobie's. Mmm....pizza ^_^.  Math: Review. Programming: Final Evaluation. I think I did mediocre.  Then bused home....sat around at home, ate, and stuff like that...and then I had to go to the church for worship practice and also cleaning it afterwards.  All that took around...3 hours? from 7-10 basically I was at church...which wasn't bad. I mean practicin' worship w/ Gavin, Grace and JT is pretty cool. We had a pretty quick rehearsal, and then cleaned for a bit. Lol Vince was there yet again ridiculing Gavin's guitar skills.  Hmm so yeah today was pretty relaxing day to end the week. Wish I coulda gone to the Chrome tonight for the bboy event....but oh well things came up....so yeah there's always next year I guess...plus I haven't bboyed in a while now....almost 2 months =S. Gotta get practicin' again...ergh so many things I wanna do...plus now I'm also gonna try out for London Youth Symphony. Arjun and Shaun think I'm gonna get owned....but meh might as well try anyways =P.  Anyways I gotta go start the slide show for Sunday....and go grab sometin' to eat. Maybe I'll play SC. Later.
