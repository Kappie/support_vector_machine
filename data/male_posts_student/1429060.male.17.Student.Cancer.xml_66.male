From what I hear, Anonymous came back onto the DOY comments (he/she caused trouble last time), but I shan't say anything lest the Anonymous commenter was a fellow just being somewhat, er, mocking.  Mom is currently ticked-off at the sewing-machine because - well, I know not what is wrong, but if I may translate what Mom was thinkng when she tinkered with it last night:  WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS PIECE OF SHIT DOING?" . Those were her mental words, not mine. But she is asking me to place a positive curse on the machine to make it work. Stand back, mortals. Observe as I raise my right hand, lower my left hand, stick out my left leg and turn the foot to the right, hop on the other foot, do the hokie-pokie, turn myself around (that's what it's all about), and speak "Remove thy inhibitions, craft of man! We produce thee, we create thy little bits, we may smite thee if such is to our gain!" Now it should work.  Alanna made me happy today because I made her happy. I told her I wake up to Kristin Hersh (at 100 decibels or so) in the morning. She shrieked and laughed. This was all during C lunch, so I am sure that we recieved a few glances.  Have a lovely day, chaps.
