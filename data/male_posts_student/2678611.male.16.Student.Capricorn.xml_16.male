Talib Kweli - Good Mourning  "Good morning, Brook-nam" Another stop... on the train (wake up... wake up... wake up...) We come to a stop that everybody got to make...  Whether you local or express  [Talib Kweli] What's the meanin of ghettofabulous Not ridin the back of the bus I'm a revolutionary antagonist Some playas is mad at us for just doin our music out of love Some underground heads is hatin cause we have fun at clubs I'm probably on some government list for my rhymin You a fool if you don't think they already tapped your line Medicine is big business so my remedies is herbal It's music is for the people so we Reflection Eternal Listen, you hear the difference between science and science fiction We blow it out like if you leave on every appliance in the kitchen  at once; still rolling kind bud in Cuban blunts On the corner watchin how kids comin to Brooklyn for they fronts Niggas run past what they need chasing after what they want Fuckin chumps, you walk down the street and get jumped Brooklyn cats like to bubble out of town no lookin back When you a ghetto chef you mastered the art of cookin crack Some get caught sleepin on the Mother City so when they go They come back as tales of niggas we used to know Never looked up to see the stars in all they heavenly glory Just straight ahead cause the peripheral is buildings with mad stories Not floors but dramas is played out, shorties get laid out like respect and fade out like TV sets into the banks of our memories (let it be) we'll never forget you Lyin on your deathbed askin for God to bless you  [Hook: Talib Kweli] Good mourning, good afternoon, good night What have you done with your life? Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man I'm puttin up a hellafied fight {*Hi Tek scratch: "Stay awake to the ways of the world"*}  [Talib Kweli] I need you all to be clear on exactly what I'm sayin With your attention span I understand that I ain't playin You mistaken if you somehow think it's just me you facin Starin me down while your enemy is standin adjacent My heart is racin but I know just what I stand for We chasin death carelessly like +Jessica+, I +Care Moore+ Who said, "Just because no one can understand how you speak don't necessarily mean that what you be sayin is deep" In case you die in your sleep you ask the Lord for a blessin Sometimes they sneak up so quiet that the silence is deafenin You'll never know who the assassin is until it's your time to go Your life is flashin, askin for forgiveness but you move too slow Now the people that you love bear the pain that you once harbored You was livin for yourself so you could never be a martyr Life is hard, death is harder; you somebody baby father Someone's lover, son of your mother, somebody brother Somebody nigga, now your spirit in the air like a whisper Hearin your name mentioned when we pourin out some liquor The days go by quicker and the nights don't seem to differ It's gettin cold, so I shivered and asked my soul to be delivered  [Hook: Talib Kweli] Good mourning, good afternoon, good night What have you done with your life? Everybody time comes to be embraced by the light You only scared to die when you ain't livin right, man I'm puttin up a hellafied fight {*Hi Tek scratch: "Stay awake to the ways of the world"*}  [Talib Kweli] Yo, the time come for everybody.. It ain't somethin you can really prepare for  Yo, yo, Mad Duke, rock rock on and Curtis Mayfield, rock rock on and Grover Washington, rock rock on and My Aunt Hazel, rock rock on and Big L, rock rock on and Freaky Tah rock rock on and Jerome Green, rock rock on and Slang Ton, rock rock on and We celebrate life.. {*echoes*}   ^ thats that straight real shit, no talk about spinners and fuckin bitches in a club.   more lif and ak greatness  Inhuman Capabilities Lyrics by Akrobatik  feat. Mr.Lif   Akrobatik [Mr.Lif in brackets] Akrobatik brings the closest thing to lyrical perfection When I extent my tecs send spiritual conections Never catch me lounging in the ignorant section Kill emcees for my profession, with the lyrical [invection?] injection [Does akrobatik burn?] No question! I'm vexed trends got ladies drooling over the next men But I flex pens and bench-press thoughts to build my strength Cuz the battle will be long and I plan to go the length You can search latitude and longitude and never find a stronger dude My attitudes define emcees to prey on for food My minds like hannibal lectur's Cuz when it comes to eating niggas up I give cannibals lectures [It's time to peep some artists of a different texture] Uplifting the motivated, mentally slaying the extras [They look gorgous as soon as rigor mortis sets in. This is when Lif steps in. Just in time to bust another lyrical headspin. and windmill... Hes been ill. since way back! He came into the studio laid back Then he proceded to blaze a hole in your track Hurry up and get sum medical aid, the beat starting to fade This dj's cutting you on a blade And if you reach for the board your fingers sliced the niggas nice. You got caught up in a lyrical heist And got physically diced You can try to splice him back together] Will he be the same? [Never]  -scratching- Inhuman capabilites Is the god human Inhuman capabilities We the inhuman  Yo! We stand miles above ur highest point 93 million styles above ur flyest joint  Welcome to the brain you about to get the grand tour Bringing rappers to they demise like Gigantor Speaking of demises me and Lif about to plan yours The incompetent we stomping them at the damn door [Cuz he'll never comprehend what we stand for We'll f**k up your Air Force and start up a land war. Running down the line A to Z like transor Go the whole line like 5 and 4 Combined after the poeple signed I heard the people find me...to be...mad shockin when im rocking Check how our voices are] Interlocking! [To crush the mental toxin, thats poisening] You and yuor offspring [So were launching] Bombs! [In fact, a full scale f**king attack] On anything wack [Ak hold back] Naw never that! [I'll sever that thought completely] You are now getting sleepy [Hypnosis] Submerged [I'm under] Implant elements [Lightening] Thunder [I'm surfacing] Prepare to [Start murdering those verballize but really aint wise Give them several tries they still meet they demise Ak and Lif defy] Aries [Large] Got everything you need [Hammers] Claws [Stitches] Bars [Flamethrowers and saws] Lif and Akrobatik always blowing the spot [Cuz we do the type of shit the average human cannot] Span the globe on foot [In a day an a half] Go back in time and tell Confucious that [He don't know the math] Control the elements like a male X-man Storm with a staff Navigate the 7 seas on a white water raft Confiscate all your rounds even before you pull your gun out [Put some spit on your index finger] And put the sun out!    duo artist compilations like that kick serious ass, just like Cannibal Ox  http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Cannibal-Ox/
