Although if he was smart, once he stepped in it he would probably figure it out pretty quickly.  Anyway, today we had to wear a suit.  And in a truly rare accomplishment, I got the tie right on the first try.  Not too long, not too short, just right.  Isn't it sad that I thought that was worth writing about??
