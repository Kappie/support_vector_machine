I haven't gone outside.  I realized I hadn't gone outside for 2 days during x-mas break... I ended up running out of the house and just... standing there for 15-20 minutes. Not because i felt i had to, even though that was a part of it, but because texas is never cold. God dammit, why isn't it cold?
