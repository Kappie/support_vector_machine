Nice to be home... but immediately my sensitive nose became itchy runny... skins start itch abit too... well i guess its the pollution from the neighbouring countries again... Before coming back,.. yesterday i went shopping at Harbour town... and managed to get a bargain of Mambo T-shirts!   Mambo Bargain!       after that we went to eat japanese food at Goldcoast... its was pretty good and genuine, the place was jammed packed... After dinner we embarked on long journey up the scary road to Natural Bridge Park to witness the spectacular Glow Worms in the cave with waterfall inside.... Yeah it was like having many bright blue stars in the cave.... beautiful! but too bad we cant take photo of it... The glow worms are sensitve to lights... so if you guys are going there... pls refrain from using lights inside the cave... Its late now... better go sleep lor... and dream of what delicious local food i shall eat tomorrow!... ;)
