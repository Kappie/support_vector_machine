       
      Think about your favorite tree With its roots, branches, and leaves Casting its cool shade over you A place to think and rest for three.  What is it about an old tree That makes us look up and wonder "Why can't I be like that thing Oblivious to even thunder."  Standing there majestically Makes us stop, stand, and stare At the branches and the leaves That are found up high there.  As we stand there looking up, We wish our lives could be  As sturdy and as carefree as That big, old, leafy oak tree.  And so we begin to think again Of choices we could decide to make To make our lives just as good As the tree at the side of the lake.
