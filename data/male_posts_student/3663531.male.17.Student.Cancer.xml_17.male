You would think staring at a computer screen wouldn't help, but surprisingly the pain subsides when I sit down and start whatever it is that I do...  Oh yeah, nearly forgot  urlLink The Encyclopedia of Arda  for all your Lord Of The Rings needs. Explains the slightly confusing aspects of the films in regard to the book, so if you dont have the energy to read the books, this place will fill the gaps.
