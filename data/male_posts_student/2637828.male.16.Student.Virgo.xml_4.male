They reported that 93 children died in the fire which originated at the kitchen of the private school. But the question is : who is to blame for the devastating fire? The other day the I read in a leading newspaper , the letter of a person who said that the government should take measure to prevent fire, but is it possible for the government to put and end to such mishaps? It is us who is to blame.  We Indians are so careless that we don't even value human life. For safety, whether it is from fire or from any other accidents, we must change this attitude of ours. We, the people, must be cautious first. If I once cycle around in my cycle in out small town I have to remain alert that a child, unattended, don't fall before me. I often see children running around in the road or some stupid drivers driving at unimaginable speed or some young people showing tricks on their bikes. If the circumstances remail like this than safety will always be a far-away dream in India.
