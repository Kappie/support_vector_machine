This really sucks because my relatives over there are going to treat me like some kind of royal figure. I am not the kind who likes a lot attention, escept from my close family. Apparently, they are preparing like crazy over there for when we arrive. I hear that they are even getting  hot water  for us. This is gonna be a little uncomfortable, meeting people that I have not seen in a long ass time. Oh well. I think i might just keep to myself while I'm over there.
