I got to get out of Biblestudy.  Lisa and I talked.  Nothing really came of it.  I can wait.  I don't want anything rushed.  I want something that she thought through.  Today was fun.  I vacuumed Bobi's pool, painted some steps, mowed the lawn, etc.  Wasn't bad.  Now I'm going to be a nerd and implement PEAR's DB_DataObject into the church site.  Should be a good learning experience.
