While many of us last year when taking the World History exam believed that to "pass" we needed to get a 3.......well I guess we passed but it doesn't count for anything at alot of the schools that we may be trying to get into when applying next year.  I have also heard a rumor that the University of Washington doesn't accept 3's......this is only a rumor but I would like to hear from anyone else who visited schools to see what other schools demand on the AP Test to count for college credit.                            -Pat
