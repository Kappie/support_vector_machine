I happened to casually mention in to a friend whilst in town and she insisted that we go and do immediately. After some deliberation I agreed and off we went. I subjected myself to a certain degree of pain and then paid Â£24 for the priviledge.  Now advice for any person thinking of doing something similarIfff you take it out for more than 2 hours it WILL close over. I thought 'that's fine, it won't hurt to much to shove a piece of metal though my skin'. Big mistake. One month later I ended up going to bed with a slightly swollen eye and woke up with a satsuma attached to my eye-socket. I wouldn't want to disgust you but after taking it out I realised what was actually in all the swelling.  So I made an appointment at my nearest surgery. 'I'm sorry you are not resgistered here' she says. 'That's right I moved about five minutes further from my old surgery and they kicked me out' I say. 'well if you come down at 5 PM you can fill out some forms and register'.  So I go to a history exam with one eye and then go straight to the doctor's and having not been ill that often was quite shocked but also amused at the things I saw. I followed the warren of corridors to the 'upstairs waiting area' in the surgery built in a Victorian House and took my seat. Across from me was a young man about 22 falling asleep, to my right was an old man... falling asleep, completely unable to keep his head up. to my left was a woman with her head back, quite possibly asleep. Then across the room was a man that looked completely terrified and this was only made worse when his name was called. he bowed his head, either to pray or deliberate whether he was going to go in. I just sat there and thought that my condition wasn't really worthy of an appointment compared to these people. in fact the only other person who looked relativlely calm and alert was a guy about my age 16 or 17 with a nice pair of legs,so I decided to pass the time taking glances at them. Not at all harmful, i'm still completely devoted to my boyfriend. I do remember sitting there and thinking he would probaly do the same thing in my position.  So that was about it they slowly got picked off one by one, and i eventually left with a course of antibiotics and the smell of TCP on my clothes.  So ot looks like all of got to concude is that doctor's surgerys are full of sick, tired people. a revelation I know!
