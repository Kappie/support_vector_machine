Here's what I'm thinking:  FALL Constitutional Law Bankruptcy Economics of Regulation and Antitrust Seminar on Law and Literature 1-Credit Pass-Fail Accounting Class  WINTER (we have this strange little 3-week winter term, where you take one class that meets for a whole bunch of hours every day) Food and Drug Law OR Psychiatry and the Law OR Secure Transactions  SPRING Tax Communications Law [and one more course to be determined, possibly Corporations]  A heavy fall, a lighter spring... but just because there's more stuff that interests me in the fall... recognizing that Fall Recruiting may mean that having a heavier program that semester will come back to haunt me.  Coming tomorrow: something funny about course selection, hopefully in the form of an 800-word newspaper column
