Right now it's 12 at night so I'm typing this really in my mind Saturday but technically it's Sunday. Ok let's update the things that have happened the past few days. Friday, Mr. Ferrante let us watch Family Guy. I cleaned out my entire locker because the custodians are locked them all up after school. Friday, well sorta last night, I hung out with Heaton and James and Heaton's brother Bill who's awesome. We just did random things like play football with this really soaking wet water absorbent ball. Mike got a new computer. I played with his rabbit alot. We watched some Monty Python. I got to shoot his paintball gun. All these things I'm saying sound very weird. I played with his rabbit and got to shoot his paintball gun, oh I'm naughty. "Sex in the city, and I don't mean the show! Oh I'm just naughty, somebody spank me!" If I messed that quote up please tell me and I'll fix it. Haven't seen that episode in a while. I need to get the Family Guy DVDs. So last night was ok. Let's talk about Saturday, crazy day. Performed at Molly Blooms with Aftermath, we were great. My first show, there were like 5 people there so it wasn't very psyching but hell of fun. I love that band, they're all great people and so devoted. That's one of the few musically inclined bands in this school. Ok so after the show, Matt and I cruised around town on bikes and went to the pizza place on the corner of Brooksite and Main St., I think Schreck wants a job there too, if I get the job I'm gonna get Schreck in too. Then we biked to Matt's and just hung out there for a while. Then we went to his cousin Alex's. It was fun. What else, uh...yea that's basically it. Ok, for today...now I'm updating the post at 9 at night Sunday...today kicked ass. Smithtown Day. Pat, Mal, Eric and I went to Smithtown Day. We met Ahmad there and we all walked around together, got some Mr. Softee, Pat bought a Jesus watch and Mal bought some other watch. The highlight of the day was definetly watching this little kid dance next to this orchestra that played next to the library. He was like marching and dancing in place and making a "GET OVER HERE" gesture with his hand to some other kid. I saw little PJ with Linsday and her cousin (I think?) Also saw Matt with Ryan Monahan, haven't seen that kid since 7th grade. He moved. What a shame. That kid used to bounce off the walls, kinda like me. And uh...yea. So Matt had to unlock my bike from the chains at Quiznos because I left it at his house last night and he rode it into Smithtown Day. Who else did I see, Erin, JAMES, Ryan and his friend Dan from Sachem. Ok yea so we went back to Pat's house after Smithtown Day and watched Scary Movie 3. The deleted scenes are hilarious. You gotta see it. The Hulk shitting out an alien head and all the ring girls attacking Trinity and the midget ring girl gets kicked in the air. Some of the deleted things they definetly should have kept. Michael Jackson's laugh...ahhh. But I have to say the most uplifting part of the day was Ahmad teaching me Schism on the bass. I was so excited when I got the beginning down. Then I went home, drums for 4 hours or so...now I'm here. GETTING READY FOR THE LAST FULL DAY OF SCHOOL!!! YES!!!!!!!!!
