Added to that were a score of live instruments like djembe and saxophone. Really great. It was a reminder of how much I love the not-so-commercial dance genre.  I went there with two lady friends, who were ready to go elsewhere within an hour (I was having a ball!) so thank God an old friend whom I hadn’t seen in years was there with me as well. I hung around with him after that. It was unbelievably hot and somehow I didn’t get any sunburn. I don’t know why… I didn’t even get that much browner! I think a negro would have been sunburned in  that  sun. But I was spared. I guess helping that old lady across the street must have pleased God or whatever. Weird things happened as well. Things like people calling me and expecting a conversation while I am right in front of the podium dancing and shouting at Laidback Luke - things like several of my metal friends showing up at a dance gig. (Including one who had been calling me gay the entire week for wanting to go see Laidback Luke.) Things like acquaintances showing up minutes after I ordered a taxi so I couldn’t stay any much longer. And the strangest thing, after coming home my parents had somehow heard that I had found a girlfriend there and they were expecting juicy details… Must have happened while they were calling me during the Laidback Luke session…
