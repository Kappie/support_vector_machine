After/During the whole time, which I now wonder if I was really interested, I kept thinking of a quote from  The Fly :  "Flesh does not motivate me. No, mine is a penentration beyond the veil of flesh."  Horribly emo I know, but there's just something that strikes me about it. I need to think about this much more, but I think I may have pulled myself in far too deep. Maybe I should just go along for the ride.  Is it a bad thing that I kind of wish I was home? The constant classes are wearing down on me, and I somewhat miss talking to people I know.   This is really the most interesting thing going on right now in my life, and it should be. But still, why do I feel so strangly enthusiastic yet unmotivated? Hah, when did I get so apathetic - must be the lack of sleep. I'm not really suprised that with this outcome though. I just realized I need a friend more. I'll do a boring yet important later. There are some very important things going on, and they should be touched upon. But right now, I don't know how to feel. Not really sad, but not estatic either.  At least I can  urlLink look foward  to things and  urlLink laugh  at others still.   And now I wonder if this at all aptly describes how I feel right now.  Oh well. I shouldn't complain so much.
