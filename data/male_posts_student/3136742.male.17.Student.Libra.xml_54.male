The more insensitive the rambling, the more awake I am (see my post about death, if I ever decide to post it). So what was I thinking of last night that stopped me from going to sleep?  I want sex... not wild, sweaty, animal sex... not passionate lovemaking... sex... The real kind-- fun, goofy, walk your ugly ass around naked to get a sandwich during coital-intermission--sex. That's the way it should be, sure; sometines serious, sometimes hot (with two "t"s), but generally is should be about having fun and possibly having a laugh. Bill Maher once said something like "There are only two pure things in life-- Two pure feelings-- Laughter and Orgasm. Neither can be faked very well (and neither should be faked)." The best would be combining the two, laughter and orgasm. They are the purest feelings. They are what make us human. Why not enjoy them both at the same time?  Why is my mind--Why are all our minds-- so driven by sex, when it's no more fun or interesting than anything else [no more fun than what we make of it]. Maybe its because people put too much pressure in it. I don't know anyone who's had good sex. Both partners are usually too bashful and everyone complains about it behind their lovers backs like it's not remotely their fault. It is their fault though, but it's not something they should be ashamed of. It's everyones fault. Just open up, have fun, and laugh.  Does my being driven by sex have anything to to with my being single? Is it really just sex that I want?... I don't think it is... And what's with those tantrists? Why would they want sex to last for hours? Is it the intimacy or something? Can they keep it fun for that long? Otherwise, sex should be an hour, max. I gaurentee you'd get bored after that (If not, drop me a line :-) )... You strip. You hump. You switch positions a few times. You hump some more. You cum. You clean up. You're done. It's not like mowing the lawn; where it takes a few hours and each time you do it a little different to see how to go about it most efficiently, and which way is easier on your back. It's just sex... Sex with virgins is worse than no sex at all. I never want to do that again. No one knows what they're doing. Everyone is afraid to try anything. It's always a fiasco. Even worse when both participants are virgins. So, what are your thoughts (or do I even want to know)? How do you like it? ---- "Waiter! There is too much pepper in my poppykosh, but I would be proud to partake in your pe-can pie :-)"
