Not at all. Friggin typical. Talk about the estimate exam a couple of months back being misleading! I got an A on it. I have no idea what I'm gonna get for this monster.  I could swear the world is out to get me. On some kind of revenge trip for something I did? Its a massive consipracy. *looks around shiftily* Dont...trust...anyone...  Hopefully some junk food will help me get over it. Actually I think I'm over it already. Yea. The junk food does help. There you go folks, to get over a bad day or something annoying happening.... eat junk food! Yey! I feel better already.
