Today I briefly started to work on a French diALogue with Richie (oh, I'm sorry; he wants to be cALled "Rich" now... first he wouldn't let me cALl him Dickster, now he wouldn't even let me cALl  him Richie? Incroyable!), in which I was a poor lawyer who sold avocados to make extra money. This is comicAL because the word for lawyer in French is the same word for avocado in French.  I got my student ID, but I was a white rectangle in my picture, and I had a distinguishing mark across my face that said "PHOTO."  In Speech I researched my fate vs. free will debate (I'm arguing fate), which caused the professed stupidity of my partner to become apparent. I ALso had a fun but somewhat brief theologicAL conversation with Josh Turner (Alex Turner's brother), who is planning to be a pastor.  I had a double-block of History, the highlight of which was my public argument with my teacher, Mr. Vignone, about democracy/republic semantics.  Science was pretty fun, too.  This is the faceless wonder (see 4th paragraph), signing off.
