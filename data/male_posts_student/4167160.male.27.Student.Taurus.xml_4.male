Sushi in the picture is "maki sushi (or maki-zushi)". Here in the U.S., I often see roll sushi lapped with rice and a sheet of seaweed in. That is not the sushi seen in Japan. Well, I am just saying it, and certainly do not mean what is right or wrong. I think maki-sushi rolled with seaweed is like a hotdog. It just makes easy to grab and eat without chopsticks. In old days sushi was not supposed to be eaten with chopsticks. or I should say, the style in eating sushi with chopsticks was not considered a cool way.  Two kinds of roll sushi in the pic are eel and cucumber (upper left), and crab meat and avogado(lower right).     urlLink    maki sushi!!  urlLink
