So we made up a story:  There was once a girl called Anna who loved swimming, she was the champion at her school and was soon to go into the Florida youth championships. She was very strong and had an olympic carreer infront of her but one day a tragedy happened. She was swimming in her community pool one day, supervised. It was a very busy day so she had absolutely no worries and she as a very safe girl. She ran over to the deepend of the pool infront of which lay a massive plam tree which cast a shadow throughout the whole deep part of the pool. No kid dared to enter it on fear of being eaten by crazy made up monsters but Anna wasnt like that. She soared through the air qas a start of an elegant dive. and glided through the water with no splash, like a beautiful penguin or seal. Anna shut her eyes not realising that the end of the pool was nearing her elegant face. With a silent crack of bones blood clouded across the deep end of the pool but was only absorbed by the shadow making it even less opaque. Nobody could see her unconcious body. A week later her parents called everyone suspicious of what had happened, the last anyone had heard she had been swimming at the public pool. So the parents searched the pool and the whole area, only to find her bracelet in the deep end of the pool. Years later the tree started to take a strange form, just like the beautiful face of Anna. But winter came and it died, one thing did not die though. The shadow of the grand tree was stuck there to warn other children of the dangers, however Annas warnings were rather vengeful, 27 kids went missing that year and the shadownn got larger. The pool was eventually closed only to be opened 20 years later in 2004...  i made nearly all of this up right now on the spot, the story though of a girl dying there was made up by me and carlos   N-joy.
