I'm not intending to generalize, just to note a specific kind of thing that's out there.  "I used to have friends, but since I started working here, it's hard to find time, and so I don't really anymore."  That's not verbatim at all.  But sentiments like that -- I don't think it's a real effective recruiting line for a lawyer to say when he's interviewing someone.  These mostly aren't things I've actually heard -- I'm trying to exaggerate for effect here -- but these would be equally ineffective lines.  If you're interviewing people, you might want to avoid them:  >"I've only pulled 5 or 6 all-nighters... in the past week." >"I don't understand work-life balance.  Work *is* life.  Isn't that enough?" >"Sure, I don't know how many kids I have.  But at least I'm filthy rich." >"I know my secretary's name.  Oh wait, no I don't." >"I know my wife's name.  Oh wait, that was the third wife.  What am I on now, six, seven?" >"You have interests on your resume.  You're not planning on doing those things while working here, are you?" >"You can leave and have dinner with friends.  As long as you come back afterwards." >"I work part-time.  5 days a week, 9 AM - 7 PM.  A reduced schedule." >"We have Broadway tickets.  No one's ever been able to get out of work in time to go." >"Everyone I know who's a lawyer is sad.  Here, you'll be no sadder than anywhere else."
