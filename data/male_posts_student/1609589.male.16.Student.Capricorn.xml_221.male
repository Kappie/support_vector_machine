One of them deserves it for being a bitch, but syed helped. the ONLY thing i asked her to do was come up with examples of what a good thesis would be, but she just acted frustrated, flirted with charley(who happens to be gay), and talked on AIM. Fucking bitch. Noone is helping me in the other groups either. I dunno what the hell I'm gonna do. I've found out my plan for the weekend:  Friday: Goto school, give charles his god damn dollar(lmao), bomb the history presentation, and have a miserable rest of the day.  Friday after school: Be fucking bored, plot to get Ms. Cooper fired  Saturday: Sleep in, probably have to do chores, more boredness, at 8:00 pray for a huge thunderstorm on the Horizon Players show so their power goes out and allll their makeup boxes and all their crap they had to take up our god damn room for the lockin gets washed away.  Sunday: goto church, complain at everything, then be told by one or more of the advisors that it wasnt a big deal(even though its a HUGE fucking big deal), basically be the happiest i've been all week because i get to see my friends again, then go home and be fucking bored.  Think i'm too bitchy? Here's what you should do:  1. Go and shut the hell up because I don't care what you think. 2. See above. 3. give me all your stuff 4. listen to some rap and get yourself allllll stupided up 5. staple your head to a table 6. Swallow Liquid Nitrogen  Hopefully Cheryl will have her movie-watching party soon. That will kick ass.
