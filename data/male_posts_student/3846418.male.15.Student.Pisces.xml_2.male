So now im inside listening to some Blink and trying to cool off after being out there in that scorching heat for so long. Going away to Killbear to go camping on thursday, not really looking forward to that, going ot miss Andrea A LOT and it will probobly be boring as hell. After I get back form camping on the 16th I have one day free, then my parents decided it would be a good idea for me to go to camp...FREAKING CAMP I'm so glad my parents were nice enought to plan my entire summer for me, how thoughtfull... THOSE FREAKING ASSHOLES. Anyways im not going to back from camp untill like early august (the first or second not sure which) at which point I will probobly have gone insane from lack of friends and fun. Well anywho i better eat something because im going to a movie with andrea tonight and i don't want to be starving.
