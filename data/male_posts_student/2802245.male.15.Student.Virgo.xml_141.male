Also, you can change font, but the funny thing is, the default font is Georgia which is my preferred font, so no changes there! I see James has changed to a smaller lighter font, being minimalist again >_>    Haven't got any Flash done today, just couldn't bebothered.I hear James is actually working on hid Flash project... That's good news, no?Note to James: They are NOT eggs! They are  blobs  :) Also noticed the gif image stretched out which screws up the layout. In the future, don't do that, notice that James. Thing is, although I have published the whole blog a million times over, I don't see the changes for at least an hour or two, unlike Life Eh? Which does it immediately :I've actuallygot 1700 frames in the Flash of the movie in the 1st scene. There will be 1 more full scene, and a credits scene and a preloader scene. I also have the basic storylines for the sequels, parts 2  and  3 of the Flash. Pretty l33t, huh?    I'm also thinking for running a Invision board jacked up with some nice cosmetic hacks with Hanadmining it, running for3 sites, Black Ghost Studios [run by Beckett and me], Dragontail's Lair (Build II) [run by Han and me]and dbeckett.co.uk [run by Beckett]. At the moment I'm trying to persuade Fish aka Daniel to do it. He hasn't responded yet):/Once that happens, I'll try to get all 3 sites on a webring. Heheheh }:]    Gotta make most of the l33t idea before Fish says no. Probably. Heh, must plead some more.      Jamie  ,   urlLink Black Ghost Staff
