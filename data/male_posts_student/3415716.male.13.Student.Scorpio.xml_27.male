I ended up having to go through this whole process so they would look for my bag. Any way I had to go shopping for another outfit because I didn`t know when my bag would be found. The malls here in Montreal are huge. It`s basically five stories of clothes, tech, and shoe stores. Plus there was more then one connected to each other. The good news is they found my bag and it should be delivered. I`ll try and get some pictures of Montreal. By the way, French is way harder then I thought but almost everyone speaks English too.
