Now, lets get this fight started!” Don Vito yells into the microphone as he scratches the crease between his thigh and ass cheek.  	“In the red corner – you know him from his god-like dancing skill, maybe you know him from his guest appearances in many movies and T.V. shows, I give you the god of soul, James Brown!”   	The crowd goes wild, no one can hear Don Vito as he tries to speak into the microphone, and all that is heard is the chant of James Brown’s name.  	“James James James James!” The crowd chants as James Brown dances across the ring.  	“In the white that was once black corner- Michael Jackson!” At that second the lights go out and Michael Jackson walks out with beat it playing on the huge speakers. 	 	“You may know him as the creator of Thriller, but I sure as hell I know him as the king of pop!” a murmured voice said under the music.  	“I love animals, and I love children, now you gonna get danced upon oh-wee-hee” Michael said as one hand was raised in the air and the other was securely cupping his genitalia.  	“I feel good hoo-haa-ungh!” James grunted while droplets of sweat dripped from his face.  	They make their way to the middle of the ring and began throwing dance after dance moves at each other. James couldn’t hit Michael; his infamous Moonwalk was too much for the aging soul god. It looked as if Michael had won the match but then a pack of ravenous one-legged Russian prostitutes swooped Michael up in their cheaply made lingerie sack and drug him into the back alley where they tore his clothes off and hung upside down on a light post with a bondage ball in his mouth. After a few days without food for water, Michael was dead, and James brown was announced as the new heavy weight champion of the world.
