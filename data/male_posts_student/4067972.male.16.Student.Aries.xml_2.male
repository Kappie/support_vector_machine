Not anything to worry about unless it starts to hurt badly.  It'll probly be there for the rest of my life, getting smaller and bigger off and on.  My mom asked if she could slam a book on it like they did on Becker; the doctor said he couldn't advise her to do that, being a medical professional, but it might work.  That'd be the more painful approach, but if i pop it, it might go away.. for a little while anyway.  I think i'll just leave it alone.  Meanwhile, i will be keeping all of the big hard objects away from my mom....heh, i didn't mean for that to sound....well, like it sounds, or i guess like it reads.
