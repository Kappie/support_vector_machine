It had to- afterall it gave all the 39 seats the  urlLink Democratic Progressive Alliance(DPA)  it has to be seen what they will be able to do for the state. it is heartening to see that after a long time the country is being ruled by a seasoned professional rather than a hardened politician. i think this bodes well for the country as a whole as this would herald the begining of a more serious era in Indian Politics. Hoping for the best- But the Govt. has to face many challenges- from it's own allies this time.  urlLink TRS  has already started making noises in that direction- of a seperate state for Telangana. Laloo has already made it clear that he wont join the govt. without having the restraint of Collective responsibility that  participation in Govt brings, Laloo can and will be a nuisance to the effective functioning of the government.He will continue to make noises of Bihar's Pride- just a mascot for a better bargain. The state of Bihar's pride is being seen in every corner of India.  The  urlLink Common Minimum Program  as proposed by the Congress led alliance is a program of Left- as already mentioned- i dont beleive in privatising loss making companies and telling disinvesment. Disinvestment has always been in  aprofit making Industry.The Govt is there to Govern not to run factories-but it India it runs factories, Trains, Buses, Generate, transmit distribute Electricity and what not except Governing. This has to change.Lets see if that Change- Only if this change, Politicinas can be made accountable for their Duties and what they are supposed to do. Nou they find reason in running these Functions for not governing. The Politics will change- Let me see what is in store for India. Nothing can Stop an Idea whose Time has  COME  -  ManMohan Singh .  Has that Idea Come??????????
