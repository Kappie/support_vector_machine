I suppose it would be ok to just do it now but im lazy as hell and i have 3 hours before i jump in my car with no gas and head down to Napa to go to chamber choir.   U know what i realized just now, as much as i want to say that life sux, it never will and with all of the stupid shit that tends to make me feel like i should be somewhere else, in a different town with different friends, it never ceases to amaze me that, that never will and never can happen because i would be lost. I think of my life without Britt, Chels, Lani, chamber choir, barbershop, blue devils, and even VHS band and i realize that without all the secrets i have to keep and the different things that make me who i am, i would be no-one and its hard to say that i would be happier if all my problems were gone. Im sure only some of u will understand what im saying while reading this blog. And thats ok with me now more then ever because i DONT need everyone to know me, i DONT need all my problems to go away. If u really want to know me u could talk to me i mean im an open book but dont expect much unless u become a Brittney, or a Chelsea, or even a Leilani.   Wow!!! that totally came out of know where but it all is so true. I mean that Me in a nut shell, well looks like ill be going now comment if u feel need to, o and im extremly bored these days so IM me at pjporche@aol.com  Cya
