Really all I need to learn is how to tongue it correctly, and all the fingerings-yeah...minor parts...it'll be awesome though.  I can't start a brass instrument until I get my braces off...grrr. Oh well.  I have to run before my parents hang me, so I'll close with a quote that happens to come off of one of Mr. Shelton's coffee cups.  "I'm hip, I'm cool. I'm a happenin' fool!"
