My dad gave me a 7th grade graduation present early (I saw the other one, too, a new optical mouse, but I have decided to wait till tomorrow to open it and use it. Kind of a ceremonial thing), a hip-hop CD, because I wanted to have a version of "U Can't Touch This (Hammertime)" to listen to (note: I was just interested in it; I DID NOT pressure my dad into getting me it. Honest. I'm not a spoiled  brat . I am spoiled, though.). The CD also had "Ice Ice Baby", "Baby Got Back", and "Whoomp There It Is". That'll keep me busy. Oh, yeah. While I was looking for "Hotel California" on iTunes, so I could preview it (I don't have an iTunes account), I found William Hung's rendition of "Hotel California", along with other songs, like "YMCA", "I Believe I can Fly", and of course "She Bangs", on his CD "Inspiration". Is it just me, or is William Hung the world's biggest practical joke? Why the heck would  anyone  give him a record deal, or put him on magazine cover after magazine cover, if not so the whole American public and ultimately the whole entire world could laugh at William Hung behind his back for not having  any  talent  what so ever ? Yes, I know I'm late to jump on the William Hung bandwagon, but don't you agree? This guy ... absolutely ... positively ... completely sucks. At everything. He can't sing, let alone hold a note without going horridly out of tune. He definitely can't dance, and he certainly isn't worthy of a record deal, unless this is a practical joke on the media's  part. If it is so that it is a practical joke, and it pretty much has to be, I think we all need to give the mainstream media some applause, don't you think? Getting back to current day events... President Bush is visiting Fort Lewis, WA for Thursday (today) and Friday. This is weird, because ol' Dubya is visiting a place like 4 miles from me (Tacoma, WA), and traffic from Tacoma to Olympia is going to be clogged because that Monkey is coming to my area. Darned. Oh, today is the last full day of school. Tomorrow I get out at 11:10 AM, and then I'll be an 8th grader! Yay? Yeah. YAY! As celebration, we sat in the gym 5th and 6th period (last 2 periods) for "Activity Day" (that's field day, accept they put us in the gym, even though we have a PERFECTLY GOOD FIELD!!!)(AND THE FIELD IS NEW!!! THE SCHOOL IS 1 YEAR OLD AND IS IN THE BEST PART OF TACOMA!!! YOU KNOW, THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS NORTH END WHERE EVERYONE IS HAPPY AND CRIME IS ONLY PETTY, AND OF WHICH OCCURS ONLY AT NIGHT!!! WHERE THERE IS NO CHANCE OF BAD THINGS HAPPENING ON A MIDDLE SCHOOL FIELD THAT IS COMPOSED OF ASTROTURF!!!)(DID I MENTION THAT THERE IS  NO  REASON NOT TO HAVE IT ON THE FIELD?!?!? IT WAS GOOD WEATHER, TOO!!!! 85 DEGREES!!! NOT A CLOUD IN SIGHT!!! A SLIGHT BREEZE!!!)(Ugh...)  There was a Teacher vs. Student basketball game, which was exciting and fun to watch, and some wacky games some students participated in. Oh, well. Because of this, we didn't have anytime for a vocab. quiz in 6th period (only 10 minutes left in it), and there'll be no time tomorrow, because all of the periods are shortened for the last day of school.  OMG  (Yes, I'm aware that sounded an awful lot like a girl; let me assure you, this is a time when that expression has to be used. I usually use it when it MUST me used. You understand.),tomorrow is the last day of school!!! w00t! (that means  YAY!  in gamer talk). Okay, I have nothing more to say. You can begin to gather back what remaining attention you have. Go, on... SHOO!
