I think most of them turned out great, especially the one with the blue background/birch trees (I even used it for my profile pic). Of course, the 'rents get the final say in which photos make it to paper, and I'm o.k. with that. Wonder if Kinko's makes life-size cardboard cutouts . . . um, because I'm not narcissistic in the slightest  ^)
