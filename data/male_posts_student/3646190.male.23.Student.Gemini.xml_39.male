My thoughts are clouded with nostalgia like the sky is with darkness...  My eyes drink the moon light with a desert's thirst.  ---------------  July 12  I am back from the LDD Conference (the revolutionary anarchist organization I am a member of). I have never seen that kind of revolutionary talent assembled in one room before. I believe it will only get more impressive in the upcoming months. The people who came to that conference each brought something unique to the table that when put together is a formidable organization. The question left to us is can we translate that potential and talent into a living organic movement. I believe this can be done.   I felt a part of a community this weekend and I feel as if I belong to one even though we are scattered across the United States. I look forward to the day when we can live in the same area and work on a common project.   I have never been so excited about an organization in my three years of activism. It was a sight to behold, this weekend.
