You probably don't fully understand why you get upset when you make a mess, but you do. You get angry. You know you probably shouldn't, because it's only milk, but you are. I know I shouldn't. I know.  It beguiles me. It discombobulates me. A beautiful deluge of every piece of the spectrum. Torrents of delirium and hyperbole mar my conscience. I cannot, for the life of me, Comprehend this delusion of mediocrity. Like a sinking feeling from within, Although, I know I am not sinking.  Their motives, I will never quite fully understand their motives. There IS some reason, something that I, for one reason or another, have missed, or was forced to miss. There is something that I am just not getting here. Not until hell freezes over, yes? It puzzles me. It fucks me. It fucks me over.  I...I can't quite even put it into words.   Why take him and not her?   "Boys will come and go, but she will always be there."   Is it our time to go, already? Pity.  Why? Why not?   Love is love. I'm almost at that point again. That point, where love becomes evil to you, and you never want to be close, ever.
