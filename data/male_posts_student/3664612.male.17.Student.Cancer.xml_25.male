You ask your mom please but she still says no.   You miss two classes and no homework.   But your teacher preaches class like he's some kinda jerk.      You gotta fight    For your right   To party.      Your pop caught you smokin' and he said no way.   That hypocrite smokes two packs a day.   Man, livin' at home is such a drag.   Now, your mom threw away your besy porno mag. (BUST IT)      You gotta fight   For your right   To party.      You gotta fight!      Get out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear.   I'll kick you out of my home if you dont cut that hair!   Your Mom busted in and said what's that noise?   Aww Mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys!      You gotta fight   For your right   To party. (2x)   party! (2x)
