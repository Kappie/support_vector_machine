But really, there is a lot less violence than there probably should be.   Though all animals display violence,  we humans somehow cooperate much more than we defect.  In other words we are much more peaceful than we probably should be, given our genetic heritage and the incentives of violence.  I was thinking about a behavior that I've seen displayed over and over again, and trying to figure out why that behavior occurs.  The behavior is this:  two men get into an argument over something.  They each get progressively angrier and the argument escalates into what appears to be inevitable violence.  They push each other, walk in circles, and taunt one another.  Then, for some reason, the actual fight never occurs.  Then, both of the people walk away talking about how, if the fight HAD happened, they'd have emerged the victor.  You've probably seen this before, and I'm sure it happens on playgrounds of elementary schools every day.  So why would this happen?  Well, we all have an incentive to take as much as we can get, to destroy our genetic competition and take his resources.  Fighting gives us that opportunity.  But it also opens us up to being killed or aving our resources looted by a stronger opponent.  In addition to the immediate benefits of conquering an opponent, there are secondary benefits.  Those include being able to impress other potential mates with your prowess, and intimidating other potential foes.  So, perhaps the maximum payoff is not actually fighting and winning, because simply the act of fighting leaves you at risk of losing.  Perhaps the maximum payoff is getting close enough to fighting that you leave everyone with the impression that you were willing to fight, then you leave without engaging in fisticuffs.  That way, both of the fighters can claim a "victory"  to the people they surround themselves with .  It's a win-win situation.  It seems logical that we'd have evolved this way.  Besides "super-fighters" who always win, the genes of the people who take the risk of fighting would at some point fade away to extinction because eventually they'd lose.  I maximize my reward if I protect my resources, and increase my status to whoever was watching by indicating that I am willing to fight and if I had I would've won. In any event if you have any thoughts about this, feel free to comment.
