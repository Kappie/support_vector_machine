Best to read from the bottom up to make sense as I show you "Holland in Euro 2004"    This section is the comment page if you want to write anything about Holland's time in Euro04. I can only ask you not to write anything bad but I can't control you so what you say is what you think. But anyhow there's completely foul talking around here, like saying Stam's rubbish I'll delete the post cause that ain't right, is it ? I'll leave you to it then !
