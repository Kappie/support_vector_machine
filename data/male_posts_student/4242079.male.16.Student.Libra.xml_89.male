Coming to work, got stuck behind HUGE truck, 60km all the way 4. Late for work. 5. Store is in pieces, and they expect Bryce and I to fix it. Fuckers at head office just decide to "change the store layout". That means they sit behind a desk and draw pictures while their minimum wage sales associates bust their backs. Corporate whores.  Bah.
