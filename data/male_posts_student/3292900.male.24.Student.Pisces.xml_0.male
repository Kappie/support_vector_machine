In this happy little house with the gargoyle on the roof, there lived two happy men. Their names were Cuco and Lulo. Cuco and Lulo were two happy men who shared their lives with each other. They had been sharing their lives with each other for some time and they were always very happy. Cuco and Lulo loved each other very much.   Cuco was very fond of Lulo’s big and loud cackle of a laugh. Lulo was very fond of Cuco’s gentle voice. Lulo was especially fond of Cuco’s voice when he would sing to him. Cuco would write songs or rewrite old ones for Lulo and sing them sweetly to him. They were fond of each other in many ways. They were very loving and very happy. They were good mates and they loved living together in their little happy house with the gargoyle on the roof.   Before Lulo met Cuco, Lulo had been alone. Well, not alone really because Lulo always had many friends and was never short of lovers. However, Lulo had never had a mate, and he had never been as happy as he was with Cuco.   Cuco also had many friends and was never short of lovers before he met Lulo. He had even had mates whom he loved, lived with, and cared for very much. Somehow, those mates went away and left Cuco alone. But like Lulo, Cuco was never alone really because he had many good friends and was never short of lovers.   It was one day in December of the previous year, before Cuco and Lulo met, that Cuco decided to look for a potential mate on the Internet. He looked on a website where people place profiles of themselves so that potential mates may contact them if they think they’d be compatible. Here, Cuco saw a profile of a young man who was interested in art, literature, philosophy, poetry, who was very fond of Magritte paintings, and was studying to be a schoolteacher. This was Lulo’s profile and it did not have a picture of him on it. Cuco hesitated, because he was not sure what Lulo looked like, but he sent him an email thinking it wouldn’t hurt to try.   At the same time that December, Lulo had been looking on the Internet. He had had a great number of lovers, but had lately not been satisfied that his relationships with them consisted of ephemeral evenings of lovemaking. That December, Lulo opened his email and found a message from someone on that website through which he had met so many other men. This was an email from Cuco, who said he thought they might have some things in common, and wouldn’t Lulo care to look at Cuco’s profile. Lulo looked at Cuco’s profile and saw that Cuco was an interesting man. He was smart, had traveled, and had various interests. Cuco did have a picture of himself on his profile, and Lulo thought he didn’t look bad at all. Lulo was intrigued, and so he responded to Cuco’s message.   After Lulo contacted Cuco and made his interest in him clear, Cuco insisted that they meet soon. Lulo was a little busy, but he made some time one day in December, in the middle of his studying, to meet Cuco. When they finally met face to face, Cuco also thought that Lulo wasn’t bad looking. They met in a café that evening in December and spoke for a short while of a lot of things. Lulo was a bit unsure of what exactly Cuco was interested in doing with him. Lulo wondered if Cuco wanted a mate, or just an ephemeral evening of lovemaking.   Lulo did not think that he should give in to his own desire for lovemaking with this new man. He wondered whether he would give in, as he had done with the rest of the men. He thought that it was best to simply date this new man, and take small and cautious steps forward. After their first meeting, they had several dates in which they met at one café or another, and talked politely on many topics. Lulo had never held out so long with anyone else. He thought that something was different about this man and he wanted to find out what it was that made him so.  Cuco on the other hand, invited Lulo to his home several times. He had designs on Lulo. One excuse after another saved Lulo from falling prey to Cuco’s seduction. One day in January however, Lulo accepted an invitation to dinner at Cuco’s house. Lulo came to this house and saw that it was a nice little house with a gargoyle on the roof watching all who entered. The gargoyle smiled in a contented way at Lulo, although Lulo did not notice this. You see, gargoyles can see into the future. The gargoyle knew that this thing would be good for Cuco. The gargoyle knew that Lulo would be a perfect mate for Cuco. The Gargoyle knew many other things too, but at this point, he smiled for the present and the near future.   And so it happened that Lulo fell prey to Cuco’s seduction that day in January. Cuco had big beautiful seductive blue eyes. Cuco and Lulo made love passionately that evening. They also had a nice and late dinner together. After that night, Cuco and Lulo had many nights of passionate lovemaking. They also had many other dates, which consisted of dinners, drinking, attending art exhibits, or conversing about many topics in different places. Each time Lulo walked into Cuco’s house, the gargoyle smiled to himself while sitting on his perch, on the roof, above the entrance.   Like I said before, Cuco had many friends. One of his friends was Jack. Jack was a sweet and kind and caring man. He had been Cuco’s friend for many years. Jack was very nice, and when he met Lulo, he went about, in his usual way, poking fun at Lulo’s thoughts on food, politics, and society. At first, Lulo didn’t know that Jack was only joking. Lulo paused and thought about what Jack meant by making his outrageous comments in such a nonchalant way. Lulo soon learned Jack’s way of being, and he liked it. He started to think that Jack was funny and would laugh at the things Jack said. He thought that perhaps Jack liked his way of being too, and was content to think so. Lulo became comfortable with Jack and many of Cuco’s other friends. Lulo liked to think that Cuco’s friends liked him.   Lulo started to become very comfortable with Cuco. He helped Cuco clean the backyard and plant flowers in the spring. He helped him prepare for outdoor cookouts when the weather was nice in the summer. However, Lulo sometimes worried that Cuco desired ephemeral evenings of passionate lovemaking with others. He tried to break up with Cuco several times beacause of this thing he thought. Each time, Cuco, who was very patient and very wise, spoke with Lulo and talked things over with him and Lulo would end up not breaking up with him. At these times, Lulo, whose patience was too short because he lacked experience, learned what it meant to be more patient. Also at these times, Lulo would inch slowly but surely towards love.   Cuco and Lulo spent a lot of time together that year. Winter was over, spring was beginning, but before they knew it, summer came and the weather was nice and the days were long. That summer, Lulo spent a lot of time traveling to Cuco’s house, cooking out, eating, and spending nights with Cuco. Then, one day in the late summer, Cuco asked Lulo what he thought of moving in with him, in that little house with the gargoyle that sat on the roof and smiled at Lulo every time he came over. Lulo did not answer. Lulo was afraid. He had different fears that were really not rational. He did not answer him that day. Luckily, Cuco left for London that day and Lulo did not have to answer him for at least a week. When Cuco came back from London, Lulo did not bring up the subject. For some reason, neither did Cuco. This was okay with Lulo because he was so insecure about things.   Lulo often thought that people made too big a deal out of the feeling of love. He thought that love was simply a cornucopia of different and simpler feelings, which constituted the larger more complex feeling of love. He could not say exactly what all the constituent parts of love were, but he would say that, for example, respect and fondness are two of them. For this reason, Lulo was insecure when Cuco said he loved him. He could never be sure of the feelings of another. Lulo only knew his own feelings with certainty. He knew that he was very fond of Cuco. He knew that he enjoyed Cuco’s company. But he did not know what love was, since he had never really been in love, and he did not know if these simple feelings meant that he loved Cuco. He did not know the formula for love. You can see that Lulo was a bit insecure because only someone who is insecure would search for a formula for something like love. The funny thing is that, like I’ve already mentioned, Lulo had been slowly but surely inching his way towards love. He simply did not realize it.   At this time, Lulo was living in his mother’s house with his family. Lulo lived well and comfortably in his mom’s little blue house, in a nice little neighborhood called Humboldt Park. He had lived there since he was thirteen years old. Lulo was then twenty-three years old nowand still very happy living in the company of his family. His mother sometimes thought Lulo should move out, but she always changed her mind after considering it more thoroughly. What she really wanted was for Lulo not to be out so much with his friend Cuco.Lulospoke a lot about Cuco to his family.Lulo’s mother loved him very much and she just wanted him to be home more often. She would miss Lulo if he went away.   Lulo woke up at home one day that summer and went to the living room. Previous to this day, Cuco and Lulo had finally begun to discuss Lulo’s moving in with Cuco. Lulo brought up the subject of whether he would move in with Cuco one night after having had a lovely evening with him. Cuco seemed surprised, but glad at seeing Lulo’s desire to start discussing this thing. They talked about it a little bit, but Lulo still had doubts. So on this day, his mother was seated on the sofa, reading the Bible, which she did fromtime to time. Lulo sat in the chair across from her and looked at her. She noticed him and looked up from her reading. Lulo told her that his friend, the one he had been spending so much time with since winter, had asked him about moving in with him. She wondered about it and said that if Lulo thought it was good to do so, she would not object.   This came as a bit of a shock to Lulo, who all this time tried to keep most things that concerned his relationship with Cuco from his mother. All that he ever told his mother was that Cuco was his friend. Of course, his mother could tell that this man was more than just her son’s friend. Lulo told her that nothing was really certain, but that she should be aware that he was in the process of deciding whether or not this was a good thing to do. This would be a bit of a long process.   The time did come when Lulo made up his mind after talking to one of Cuco’s friends. Ray, who had been Cuco’s friend for a long time, and was awfully intelligent, told Lulo that he was letting irrational fears stop him from doing something that might make him happy and be very good for him and Cuco. Ray asked Lulo to supply one good reason why he should not move in with Cuco. Lulo supplied many reasons, but Ray struck down every reason that Lulo gave as silly, irrational, and not good enough. Ray attributed Lulo’s fears largely to his inexperience at being away from his family. It seemed to Ray that Lulo’s insecurities had nothing, or very little to do with how he felt about Cuco. He was right. All this time, Lulo had been inching towards love. At this point, he knew, although perhaps he would not admit it to anyone else, that he loved, and not only loved, but was completely in love with his Cuco.   And so it happened that Lulo moved in with Cuco after a while on a beautiful fall day in September. Lulo remembered when the trees in Cuco’s front and backyard were bare. Lulo found it odd that he had stuck with Cuco for so long because, like I said before, Lulo had never had a mate. And now it was fall and the leaves were changing color and a little time had passed since his first meeting with Cuco. This was exciting for Lulo. This was so novel. This was perhaps less novel for Cuco, because he had already had mates. However, it must have at least been as exciting for him as it was for Lulo.   There was a lot of adjusting to be done. Lulo had to adjust to living without the hum of his family waking him up in the morning. He also had a considerable amount of freedom now that he lived with Cuco. Seeing his friends, and other such things, was easier now because he only had to tell Cuco that he would be doing so, as opposed to telling his mom, and having to explain things to her, and letting her know exactly where he would be, and when he would be back, because his mother always worried too much, and needed a lot of reassurance. Cuco had some adjusting to do as well. He had to adjust to living with a mate after a little while of not having lived with one. Cuco also had to adjust to living with Lulo’s little idiosyncrasies, but then, that was true for Lulo as well.   So Lulo learned many things while living with Cuco. They became very happy living together in the little house with the gargoyle on the roof, perched above the entrance, watching all who entered. They threw parties and were very social. A lot of people thought that it was so nice that Cuco and Lulo were together. Both Cuco’s and Lulo’s friends were happy for the two of them. Both Cuco and Lulo were happy.   Now, Lulo had some friends who liked to go out to where lots of cute boys walked up and down the street. On one of these walks with his friends, Lulo came across some old friends that he knew from high school. One of them had been to the military and the other had moved to the suburbs.   Lulo took down their numbers and talked with them of becoming reacquainted. His friends agreed with him. They thought that it would be nice to become reacquainted. So Lulo kept his word and invited his long lost friends to his house whenever Cuco and Lulo had parties. His friend who moved to the suburbs never came to a party, but he did meet Lulo for a drink on a cool October night. Lulo’s other friend, the friend who’d been to the military, did come to one of his and Cuco’s parties. Lulo was so happy to have his friend who’d been to the military at his new home, and to introduce him to his Cuco, whom he loved very much.   However, the gargoyle that sat on the roof did not smile at Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military. No, no. The gargoyle was unhappy when he saw Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military at the door, and he frowned and looked discontentedly down at him. This is because, as I already said, gargoyles can see into the future, and the gargoyle saw that it was not good that Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military was entering the happy home of Cuco and Lulo. The gargoyle saw that this would not be a good thing. Lulo did not notice the gargoyle. Lulo was simply very happy to have his friend who’d been to the military there at that party in his new home, which Cuco shared with him.   Now Lulo had always known that Cuco was a bit flirtatious. In fact, Lulo thought he would break up with Cuco for this simple fact at many points before he fell in love with Cuco. However, Lulo had learned long ago that if he was to love Cuco, he was to love him as he was and not try to change him. Lulo would say that to want to change a person is to not accept that person. Acceptance, Lulo would say, is one of the constituents of love.   So Lulo had begun accepting that Cuco was a bit flirtatious, even though it made him a little uneasy. When Cuco first met Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military, he did not think to flirt. That night, when Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military came, Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military had instant chemistry with Cuco’s friend, an internationally renowned mathematician. In fact, they had such good chemistry that they ended up staying that night after the party in Cuco and Lulo’s guest room, where they had a long evening of lovemaking. But it did not end there because they also stayed next day and also had a long morning and afternoon of lovemaking. Lulo was so pleased that Cuco and he were responsible for the happiness of their friends that evening, the next morning, and the following afternoon. They were, after all, responsible for inviting them to their party, so in a way they were responsible for their meeting and their happiness. Lulo was very pleased.   Now Lulo left the house the day after the party thinking that when he got back, they would be gone. However, the internationally renowned mathematician and Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military were so comfortable with each other, and in Cuco and Lulo’s home, that they stayed very late. Cuco called Lulo and told him to come home, because Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military and Cuco’s friend, the internationally renowned mathematician, were still there. Lulo thought that perhaps Cuco felt a little burdened trying to entertain both of them for so long and needed his help with the entertaining, so he went home.   When Lulo got home, he found them all in the kitchen having conversation. Lulo was very calm and pleased and so he went to his room, changed his clothes, and joined them. Lulo was pleased that his friend who’d been to the military, and Cuco’s friend, the internationally renowned mathematician, had hit it off so well. However, Lulo wasn’t sure why they had stayed so long and was a bit uneasy because he saw that Cuco showed an attraction to his friend who’d been to the military. Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military was not bad looking. Cuco did not really flirt, but made several comments about Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military, and that was how Lulo knew that Cuco liked his friend who’d been to the military.   Lulo let this pass because that was all he could do. Finally, it was quite late and Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military and Cuco’s friend, the internationally renowned mathematician, left together. Cuco and Lulo were very pleased with what had happened. They had a nice party the day before and their friends had met and had a nice time until the next day. And now the next day was over and everyone was pleased. However, the gargoyle that sat on the roof watching all who entered was not pleased. The gargoyle knew that it had been a mistake for Lulo to invite his friend who’d been to the military to the little house in which Cuco and Lulo were living so happily.   The days passed and became shorter, and it was getting darker earlier, as winter approached. Lulo was in school and was enjoying his classes and his schoolmates. He was also enjoying his life with his Cuco. They shared many moments together and were becoming more and more fond of each other every day. They continued to have parties on weekends from time to time. Then it so happened that they had a party one weekend. Cuco told Lulo that he should invite his friends too, he even mentioned Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military by name, as if to request that Lulo invite him.   Lulo did not like that. Lulo was not very happy to hear Cuco ask for his friend who’d been to the military by name. However, Lulo thought that he should just be an adult about it and not let his insecurities about Cuco and his assumed desire to have ephemeral evenings of passionate lovemaking with others, stop him from inviting his friend. So Lulo invited his friend who’d been to the military to this particular party. Lots of people came, including Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military. There was a lot of merry making that night. Almost all of the people enjoyed themselves. I say almost all, because although Lulo enjoyed himself at first, he did not enjoy himself towards the end of the party because he saw that Cuco was being a little too flirtatious with his friend who’d been to the military, so much that everyone could see this. Cuco did not try to hide it.   Lulo tried hard not to let this affect him. He thought to himself that this was perhaps thoughtless and insensitive of his Cuco to do right there in front of him and everyone else. Lulo was very sensitive to this kind of thing and anytime he saw his Cuco do such things, it always brought back all of his insecurities. Luckily, Cuco’s friend Ray, who was awfully intelligent, was at that party. Lulo asked Ray what he thought about Cuco. He asked Ray whether he thought that Cuco could ever be unfaithful. Ray told Lulo not to be so sensitive. He told Lulo that he thought Cuco was a pretty loyal man. This made Lulo feel so much better. He did not know what he would have said to Cuco if Ray had not said such a reassuring thing. When everyone left that night, the gargoyle, who sat on his perch and observed everyone that entered the happy little house of Lulo and Cuco, shed a tear. It must have been a very sad thing to make a thing made of stone shed a tear. The gargoyle knew that soon, the happy house that Cuco and Lulo shared would be troubled. He did not like that Lulo, whom he liked so much, would have to suffer so much, so soon, but he could do nothing about it.   The next day, everything was back to normal. Cuco and Lulo were pleased and everything continued to go very well for the two of them. At that time, since it was nearing the end of the semester, Lulo started spending a lot of time at school. Lulo would stay at school into the late hours of the night working on assignments. Sometimes, after staying at school so late, Lulo and his friends would go to a bar, have drinks together, and relax and enjoy each other’s company.   It so happened that Thanksgiving Day was nearing and Lulo had to finish his assignments before that day. On the day before Thanksgiving eve, Lulo was working hard to finish one of his assignments for a class. On this day he got a call from his friend who’d been to the military. He asked Lulo what he was doing. Lulo told him that he was busy working on an assignment that he really had to finish before the following day. Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military kept Lulo on the phone for a while and would not let Lulo continue his work. He asked him about a music album that he wanted to borrow from Lulo so that he could copy it on his computer. Lulo was a bit annoyed that he would not let him off the phone, and that he wanted to borrow the album so much. So Lulo told his friend who’d been to the military that since his Cuco liked his friend who’d been to the military so much, as was evidenced at the party, and since his Cuco was home alone, that perhaps his Cuco wouldn’t mind if Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military would pay him a visit to get the album. Lulo told him his Cuco might in fact like to see him since he liked him so much, as Lulo and everyone else at the party could see. Lulo only said this because he was a bit annoyed.   Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military said that he might go. Lulo then said that it wouldn’t be a problem if he just told Cuco that he was there to get the album. And then finally Lulo said that he had to get back to his work. So Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military finally let Lulo get back to his work. Lulo continued to work through the evening.   That day the gargoyle, who sat on the roof above the entrance to the house of Cuco and Lulo, frowned upon a visitor at the soon to be unhappy little house of Cuco and Lulo.   Lulo got a call late that evening from his Cuco who asked him if he was coming home soon. Cuco told Lulo that Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military was there. Lulo was surprised that his friend who’d been to the military had actually gone to see Cuco about the stupid album. The problem was, and the gargoyle perched on the roof of this happy little house knew this well, that he didn’t go there to get the album. He went to get something else that belonged to Lulo.   Lulo answered that he wouldn’t be coming home because he had to finish his work. Cuco then told Lulo that this was OK and that he could just take his time. Lulo knew that this was OK. He also knew that he could just take his time and he wondered what Cuco could mean by stating such obvious things.   Lulo continued to work. He did not stop working. Cuco called him again. He was again wondering if Lulo would be coming home soon. Lulo answered that he wasn’t. Lulo wondered what Cuco wanted. His friend who’d been to the military was still at his house. He did not know what Cuco wanted him to do about it. He thought that Cuco liked his friend who'd been to the military and he wondered why Cuco didn’t just politely tell his friend that he was overstaying his welcome. Cuco could have very easily done this, but he didn’t.   Lulo again continued to work. He worked very late and then he saw his friends and they decided that they would go to a bar and have a drink to unwind, since they had been working so hard that day. So they went to a bar, and Lulo’s friends were happy, and Lulo was unwinding with a martini. Lulo then received another call from Cuco. Cuco wondered if he was still not going to come home. Lulo said that he had been working hard the entire day, and that he was now just relaxing with his friends at a bar. Cuco gave the phone to Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military and Lulo’s friend who’d been to the military asked Lulo about the album he wanted to borrow. Lulo said he should just take whichever album he wanted. Lulo told him he was not going to be coming home anytime soon and so he should just take whichever album he wanted.   That was the last time Cuco called Lulo that night. The gargoyle that was perched on the roof above the entrance to the little happy house of Cuco and Lulo knew that after tonight, the little happy house of Cuco and Lulo would not be happy. A transgression was committed that night and only the gargoyle and the ones who committed this act would know for some time. And then Lulo would know. And all the things that had been good up until now would turn to dust.
