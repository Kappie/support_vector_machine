But that's just really how life is.Anyway, there are some great things about being in college, but I'll talk about that next time.  I'm off to the library in a while, 'have to do an assignment inEnglish 1.. very basic, but the technicalities will make you go crazy.. you have to watch every word you use, and make sure it's in the proper category.. ok ok.  I'm just glad another week is over, and that's ANOTHER WEEK CLOSER TO GOING BACK HOME!!! I just have one exam next week, a CMSC major.  All my roommates are staying for the weekend, since they have a lot of exams next week. This is gonna be a quick weekend.
