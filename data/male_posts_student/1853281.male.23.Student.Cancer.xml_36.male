YOU set ME up with some (presumed) DREAMBOAT in your aquaitenance for a blind date. The best blind date (as judged by me according to several scientific criteria) wins. The person who sets me up recieves my gratitude and two drinks of their choice the next time we go out. Allright, lets get cracking!!!
