Inchemistry class, Sherman told me about what happened before he slept with Bernice .. i was like... omg. her parents were like so open... and Berniceherself too, popping a question of 'when are you going to have *** with me...' , really contrary to her shyness of meeting pple... lol..    Still, i am envious of this perfect pair... i still wonder, how could i have made good friends with a guy who has been so fortunate to have his dearest, compared to me who lacks it... big time.. haha... fate really baffles me.    Went to Jubilee Zone X to play some ID.. didnt run too good a timing, but i was still contented. i just wonder when my form will come back.. all that i've been striving for, working for.. slogging it all out for... just gone.. when i get this kind of bad mood swings, once in a while. i suppose its the third time this year, heck, does anyone give a damn...    Perhaps few pple know the way i am, and i seldom disclose it, i mean, i dont wanna shun pple off when they hear that i got some sad thoughts, depression, and all the crap... i've always thought of other pple to be happier than me.. emotionally... i've a stable cash flow.. for going out and stuff, but.. for the things money cant buy, i've nothing by the name of love. Aaron told me today, certain things just cant push it, unlimited amount of chasing may get me the opposite effect instead. then again, we control our destinies.. so do i go push it, or do i sit on the fence, waiting for something to happen ? i dunno... i'm lost.    To pick up from where i left off before this started would be a tall order... it just seems that i've been given a mission to jump into a black hole... and finding nothing inside.. coming back up seems impossible ATM... guess i hope i'll not linger for too long before a ray of light comes shining in, and i can walk into it.. with the help of a kind helping hand.    Everyday i claim that i neededhelp from someone, hell, couldnt i just be independent ? things would still be the way they were, and the world keeps on spinning. the fact that i'm feeling down probably didnt matter to other peepz, since its my own private business, and it doesnt affect them, too.    Living here WAS a nightmare, IS a nightmare, and ALWAYS it is. Just felt this way. Let me free..
