Then I realised my Age Of Mythology torrent had downloaded, so I installed that, using Daemon-Tools for the CD emulation - it's actually a pretty kick ass game.  Then I went to Sam's, collecting Leah on the way there, it was a 20 min walk to somewhere in Hackbridge, we watched the ring, ate (microwave) pizza and ice cream, then went home, it was pretty cool. Me, Dave and Leah got a lift with the Doerr's which was nice of them.  But as soon as I got home my mum was in a bad mood, I keep having to avoid talking to either of my 'rents cos they always tell me off for the state of a room in the house and make me tidy it; when it's blatantly been my sister who messed it up. Bloody favortism, I think it's just cos my sister has just got braces and has been milking it by putting on a lisp.  Then Jon left today aswell when I was out at Sam's, he's on a 10 day tour with his new band "Teeth," but he might be back in the middle sometime, apparently it's gunna be really "rock 'n' roll" with the tent and the vans and stuff.  Dave's making pasta, so I'm gunna go eat that soon, and then play some Age Of Mythology until I have to leave to Tai Chi, which my mum has already had a go at me for cos it'll be awkward her taking us, but she refused to let dad do it? Ok, pasta is done, best go, Dave 'tis calling me.
