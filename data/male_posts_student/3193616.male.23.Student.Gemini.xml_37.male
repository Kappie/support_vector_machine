The rules of chennai made sure that i dont watch the matches while I am in Chennai and the schedule here in the college make it even more harder to get a glimpse of it. I wonder what had happened to the famed French strength. As I havent seen the game I am unable to give any opinion but sure this is a rude shock.What happened to Zidane. To go down without a goal is a shame. I dont think this will ever be erased from the french Memory.
