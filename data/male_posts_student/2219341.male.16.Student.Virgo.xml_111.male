TWICE!  and i was alone!  and it was quiet!  well sorta.  i didnt have to be around anyone in my family so there was no one around to stress me out!  ah heaven!  well for 2 hours.  yes thats right 2 hours...i enjoyed my walks.  cept for the old ladies in bikinis.  oh man that was nasty!  YUCK!  yes well needless to say i didnt really just love my vacation.  it was more of takin my family (which already stresses me out...cept for Karin) and puttin them into a smaller space.  oh yes lemme tell ya it was just peachy.  i need a vacation from my "vacation".  aw well.  at least i have my piano again!  i've been makin up my own Canon in D.  i just listen to different parts from different versions and put 'em together.  its lovely.  i think i shall be off to bed in a bit.  im runnin on caffeine.  i think thats how you spell it.  and Marbles is outside.  she better come back before i go to bed otherwise she'll be havin a camp out.  aw well.  she deserves it.  she played me!  she was all nice a sweet and we loved eachother and then she just ditches me!  now she sleeps in Erik's bed!  i was just one of those one night stand things...that was actually more than one night but thats besides the point!  its ok.  we still make out occasionally hehehehe!  ok enough bout my personal life!  GOODNIGHT EVERYONE!
