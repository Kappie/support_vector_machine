Nick Yankovic, 86, and his wife, Mary Yankovic, 81, were found dead about 1 p.m. Friday in their suburban San Diego home by three family members, said sheriff's Sgt. Conrad Grayson, a fire investigator.  The relatives came to the house because they had not seen the couple in a while and were concerned.  Paramedics found Nick Yankovic in a chair in the front living room. His wife was lying on the bathroom floor.  A fire had been recently set in a fireplace in the house, Grayson said.  "The house was full of smoke when they opened the door," Grayson said. "We examined the fireplace. They were burning wood. They (family) had found the flue closed. They opened it."  "Weird Al" Yankovic, 44, had been scheduled to appear Wednesday night in Kansas at the Topeka Performing Arts Center as part of a tour for his new album. Attempts to reach him by telephone through his agency, the William Morris Agency, were unsuccessful Saturday.  Yankovic's parents were described by a neighbor as nice people who were proud of their son's accomplishments.  "Everybody who came to the neighborhood knew Nick," said John Buehman, who lives across the street. "They're going to be missed, big time."

Fred Finds CD Wallet In Burger King Parking Lot 10 April 2004 FREDLINE NEWS  (Clarence, New York) FN - Fred found someone's CD wallet in the parking lot of a Burger King today. The wallet was one of those ones that attach to the sun visor in your car so you can change CDs when you drive, sources say.  Though Fred asked those around the parking lot if they had lost the particular item, no persons came forward. Though there were ten CDs inside the wallet at the time, they were all classical.   "Even though the music is somewhat bland, I will still take full advantage of the free CDs and of the usefulness of the wallet," spoke Fred in a press release statement this afternoon. The press release did not say what Fred was doing at a Burger King.
