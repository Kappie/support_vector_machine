Sorry for the lack of updates. between school, video games, TV, sprite comics, and an awesome new site I discovered a few weeks ago, I have not had  any  time to do  any thing. But though four will stay, one will be voted off tonight on:  Survivor: Gage's life!  *Insert Survivor theme here.* OK, let's tally the votes. 1) TV, 2) school, 3) TV, 4) school. 2 votes school, 2 votes TV. This vote will decide who goes on and who leaves. And the final vote is...  school.  SCHOOL IS OUT BABY!!!!! Oooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh yyyyyyyeeeeeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh. No more school.
