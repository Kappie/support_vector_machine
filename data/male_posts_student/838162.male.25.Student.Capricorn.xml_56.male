Ideally it should be faster and easier for people to remember the URL. So that means everyone please update your links to point to the new address.    urlLink www.Falchion.per.sg    I'm going to try to move the blog soon, but it looks like blogger is having some problems. Will see how it goes.  I'll see you all on the other side!!
