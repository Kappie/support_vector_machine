My stupid satellite connection died out, so I will have that feature tomorrow.  Before we begin our Late Night Bloggin' journeys for tonight, there's some other things to talk about.   Holy Thunder!  Just got through one of the worst thunderstorms we've had this year.  Our garage started flooding (not as bad as last year, when they flooded about 5 inches high, 2 weeks after we had just moved in...wet boxes full of stuff everywhere).  My dog is absolutely scared, even though the storm has practically passed.  The water from the flooding is already gone, but, there is more to come...I know it.  Dog is not sleeping in my room tonight!  I may wake up to no more door in the morning!   Monopoly  My brother, sister, and I decided to play Monopoly while the TV and internet was all down.  For the first time, I actually beat my brother, who is actually pretty good at it, despite the fact that's he's really stupid and immature.  He was only able to score 4 properties, my sister 2, and me, 12.  I kept winning the money in the middle like crazy!  It wasn't only the first time that I beat my brother, but the first time that I've actually won...at all.  Yeah, I suck.    And now...onto tonight's Late Night Bloggin'!    ArchaeopteryxÂ´s Blog  Link:  urlLink Click Here   This blog is new, the guy has only been a member for a couple days.  He has posted pictures of his pet hedgehog (I would love to have one of those), posted a random picture of Cartman from the South Park, and lyrics to a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory song.  Yeah... kinda boring, but, hey, oh well.  I like to have a real hedgehog...that would kick some serious ass.  But anyway...dude, your posts need more.  You're kinda boring.  More pictures of that hedgehog should satisfy me.    He runs a gaming message board, called "Seriously!" which is pretty cool, but, only if you're one of those people who likes message boards.  Anyway, this is an okay blog, but, I've read better.   NickBlog  Link:  urlLink Click it   Wow, this guy has been around since September 2002, and his blog isn't that bad, either.  His most recent post is about how he had friends over for dinner, what he cooked, and how they "enjoyed a few smokes."  He thinks that John Kerry is a deusche bag, but...he's going to vote for him anyway.  Some of his posts are kinda pointless, but, they're still pretty cool all the same.  This blog is alright, and, for being around since September 2002, I'm pretty dang impressed.  I sure hope to keep this blog going that long.   Blog Experiment  Link:  urlLink Click   This one is apparently going to use her blog to bitch about her boss, because that's exactly what she did in tonight's post.  She just started using her blog this week, and she tonight bitched about her boss.  Meh...this one's boring.  And, that's all for Late Night Bloggin' tonight.  Be sure to check back here tomorrow, because in the morning, I'm going to be posting eBay Hunter #2, and then, 4 brand new Digital Lust updates, just for you.  Yippee.  Enjoy it.  That's all from me.  Go to sleep or something, because sleep is nice.  Sleep is good.  And I'm spent.
