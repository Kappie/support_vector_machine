I have a mountain to work to do but I can never really get round to doing it, takes too much thinking and my beloved blog is far more interesting. It's Chelsea v Arsenal in the quarter finals of the champions league, and we haven't got a snowballs chance in hell even over 2 legs, even I know that deep down, but come on Chelsea lets kick some gooner arse for once.  Also discovered I've inspired the 1st person I know (Jon from work) to begin a blog, so it's like having a blog child I guess, or inspiring one, meh I'm weird I know. Thought of me moving out are still as intense as ever, I still have to think about the whole situation a lot more though which is something I'm gradually getting better at after years of mental-to-action effect, if you understand anything of what that meant . . .  xBuBzx
