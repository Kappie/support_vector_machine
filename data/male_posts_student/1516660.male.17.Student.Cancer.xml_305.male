I was thinking...and thinking....and thinking...and just letting the water flow all over me. Heh heh.   Anyhoo, I went surfing then ate breakfast when Mother came back. After breakfast, I was assigned to clean the floors of our wonderful home. HaHa. So tiring! I hate using the vacuum cleaner, so troublesome de. I prefer moping the floor, so I let my mother vacuum, while I mop. Heh. Meow moo!  Hmmm. After that, I went online, surfed the Net then ate lunch (instant noodles). As sudden as a flying cat, CQ and WQ called to invite me to play bowling with them. It didn't take me long to hesistate. I left my handphone home, so my Mother can take it to Causeway Point's Nokia Care Centre to service it (the vibrations were spoilt).  Oh my meow. I came earlier (as usual). For the entire time waiting for WQ, I was so worried. I didn't bring my phone with me. I can't contact him to know where he is, and vice versa. I became real panicky. I have a whole new appreciation for my mobile phone. I can't do without it! Meow moo! I even have to spend 40 cents (the first twenty went into a spoilt phone in which WQ couldn't hear my voice) to call WQ. Meowing moo. We took the 960 bus towards Bukit Panjang.  We met CQ, Gloria and HuiLing at Superbowl (they went to see SP Open House together). We played three games in total. Today, my bowling skills downgraded to the point of being sucky. Most of my balls end up in the gutter. Xi long guo! HaHa! So lousy!! Everyone else played a good game. Good job people!   We came out at 4.50+, it was drizzzling. We took 960 back, with CQ and WQ dropping off at Marsiling. Me and Gloria went home by the 913 bus, as usual.   Hmmm..I came back, bathed, ate dinner and came online Oh meow! Even Survivor is meowing later! Meow moo!!!  I think I ened le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
