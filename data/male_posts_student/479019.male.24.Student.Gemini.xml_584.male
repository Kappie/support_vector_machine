It was good to hang out with the Shadowfaxians again. Some of those folks I only see like once a year.  It was a pretty good and relaxing day. I think the only sour notes were first I'm nervous about trying to make amends with someone tomorrow and second having to defend a friend from another friend. Let's just say I know this friend has a lot of negative shit going on and there's some jealousy and bitterness about some stuff, but for her to say this other friend doesn't care is so not true. It annoyed me that I had to stand up for the other friend and tell this friend that she doesn't know how hard things are for her. It annoyed me, because she knows I'm friends with this other person. Likewise, this other person has said stuff about the friend that I didn't like hearing.  ***
