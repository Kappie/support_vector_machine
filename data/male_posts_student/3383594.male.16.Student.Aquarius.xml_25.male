Well, he basically scored 2 goals in 2 mins. If tt isn't gd enough den I wonder wad is. L0L!  I woke up at 11am today as tuition was at 12pm. *sighz* I was exhausted, pretty drained. Haha, but I'm used to it as I've been in tougher situations. After tuition, I basically slacked for the rest of the day. I'm going for my dinner soon, but b4 tt I juz wanna haf my veri own wish list. This is to remind me of how much I hafta save for all these stuffs.  My Wish List: 1. A New Pouch Frm 77th Street @ The Heeren 2. Kenny G's Greatest Hits 3. Digital Camera 4. Chains/Necklaces 5. Bracelets  These are the top 5 items tt I must get, probably b4 the school reopens. Haha, 3 of them can be found at 77th Street. This will definitely make my life easier as I dun hafta go to different places to get them. I shld be getting my digital camera frm Sim Lim Square either by this wk or nxt wk. I'll update the list again nxt wk or the wk after. At least 3 items shld be gone frm this list when the nxt list cums up. L0L! I guess I'll be waiting for the 2 matches tonite, so tt's about it. I'll update u guys on the results tmr ya? Cya! =]
