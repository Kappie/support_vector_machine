Most of it came to me a while back when i was talking to JAQUE on the phone. a friend...one i love with all my heart, is leaving. and i dont think she knows how much this hurts to write about let alone talk about, and im not sure if ill be able to put all of this into words, but ill certainly try...    Natalia,  one of my best friends in the whole world. the one i always came to with all problems, and someone i would trust with my life. someone i will always love even if if you are over seas, in a completely different continent. you have always been there for me, and even through our very few fights, u always forgave me for being "me". i thank you for all of our talks, whether they were dead serious, or completely stupid and humerous, i loved every one of them. all of our aimless walks to nowhere, i realize now that they werent to nowhere, they were to our friendship. walking with u is something i will cherish until the day i die. u always took in everything i told u and gave back love and care to me. giving me truth, knowledge, and everything u had to give. i owe u my everlasting friendship, and trust me as u will always have it. i dont know if ill ever see u again after u move, but i can garuntee that u will never stop getting emails from me, and when weve all grown older and wiser, ill find u and share everything with u. and if i ever do make it big in the acting world, u can be sure to hear me thanking u when i recive an award, if i ever do. there is so much more to write, say, and express to u in ways i cant explain, but i can say one thing that im sure will sum it all up...i love u natalia as the best friend i will ever have, and i will NEVER forget u...this is my goodbye to u...love forever with all my heart...Nathan    "Good Friend"   I used to think that you were someone else  Then I'd lose my mind each day  I used to think that I could help myself   But it's true what they say  There's no reason without a way   If this is goodbye to you and me  What a good friend youve been to me  and I owe it all to you  every good thing that I do is you   I used to wish that I was someone else  Then I'd dream away the day  Those dreams have made me into someone new   And it's true what they say  There's no better time than today   If this is goodbye to you and me  What a good friend youve been to me  And I owe it all to you every good thing that I do is you   I am here  I need to say  That I will miss you  Every day   And it's true what they say  there's no better time than today   If this is goodbye to you and me  What a good friend you've been to me  If this is goodbye to you and me  Well what good friends we will always be   And I owe it all to you  Every good thing that I do is you  Every good thing that I do is you  It's you  Every good thing that I do is you  It's you  Every good thing that I do  I owe it all to you  Every good thing that I do is you   Song By - 9 Days
