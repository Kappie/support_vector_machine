As long as what a person does causes no harm to another, the government shouldn't get involved.  This is why I'm for the legalization of marijuana.  Right about now you're probably thinking I've either lost my mind or that I'm on the herb myself.  Either way, you're wrong.  Just think objectively about it for a minute.  Add the amount of money the government would save each year if police didn't have to combat the use of weed and the amount of money that could be raised by imposing federal taxes on the drug.  Quite a bit of money, isn't it?  Now, the use of marijuana, or any drug for that matter, goes against my personal feelings and against my religious faith.  The governments job is not to protect you from yourself.  Its your own fault if you destroy your life with alcohol or drugs. Besides, if the pot head down the street is paying taxes on his weed, maybe Uncle Sam won't have to take so much out of my paycheck each week.   Check out  urlLink this page.   It debunks most of the common myths about the use of marijuana.  Definately worth a look.
