My dad and his attorney have my mom so upset that it doesn't seem to matter what I do, she either gets pissed with me, or accuses me of not caring about her situation.  And I can't help but react, which just makes matters worse.  Before I came up here, I thought it'd be pretty hard to adjust to living at home again and after living indepedently for 5 years, and unfortunately I wasn't completely wrong.  I don't think more than a day has passed w/out us butting heads.  It's becoming frustrating beyond imagination.    Just really feeling like I'm going it alone through this whole thing. My mom's too emotionally busy with her own stuff, my dad is off living in his own selfish delusional world, my good friends are either 500 miles away in San Diego or busy with their new jobs, and that doesn't really leave anyone.  If it sounds like I'm feeling sorry for myself, I probably am.  I'll get over it, but I really hate days like this...   All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, worn out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere, going nowhere Their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tomorrow, no tomorrow  And I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very mad world mad world
