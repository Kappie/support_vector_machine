We even barbeque with umbrella covering the rain!!! This remind me of the npcc Bbq pit... Its was raining heavily but we still barbeque! We tied the tents for camp to the trees which servers as a shelter for us to bbq... There were so many people that every one were shoulder to shoulder in the "shelter" there were so much fun...  Just now we spent most of the time joking and telling dirty jokes... To our surprise, My cousin who is just only primary 4, able to tell dirty jokes better then we do!!! Oh man... This show's how polluted the younger generations are... Haha...  Out of a sudden, we heard something defening... We turned and saw fireworks lighting up the skys!!! A few of us, without any hesitation, run towards the place where it was released... By the time we were able to see the sky ckearly, we only managed to catch a few glimps of it before it stops...  Feeling disappointed, we ran back to the pit and continues to barbeque again... After going to the beach, i felt my mood settled down already... Quite good now... Hope by tommorrow morning i would be able to recover... But if i fall sick also good, like that i wouldn't need to go to school and take English mock examination... Hehe... So bad...   Ok... Shall end here now... Good day!!!  Love Louis
