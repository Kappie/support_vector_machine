But I don't think that she feels the same. We used to talk all the time, and we were good friends, but now I don't see her because it's summer and I don't have a car. I think about her everyday. I don't think that I've felt this strongly about aperson before. Is this love that I feel, or is just an overblown case of infatuation? I want her to know that I feel this strongly about her and that I have ever since we started talking. Well I'm off. Salve.
