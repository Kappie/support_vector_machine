To set the stage, I'd like to entertain you with a little anecdote:  So the greatest guy in the world - for ambiguity's sake, let's call him "Adrian" - is playing Counter-Strike online one Victoria Day afternoon when a certain individual - who, for ambiguity's sake, we will call "Priscilla" - hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet, signs onto the server Adrian is playing in and changes his screenname to "i fight for allah". Adrian, being such a smart guy, corrects Priscilla, saying Allah is, in fact, spelt with a capital 'A'. To which Priscilla responds, "allah is not my god, so i choose not to capitalize it." Adrian is struck upside the head by this comment, and as a result, ceases to refer to himself in the third-person.  Yes, folks, believe it or not, "Allah" is a proper noun, and as such should be spelt with a capital 'A'. Priscilla's comment is the equivalent of saying "George Bush isn't my president, so I'm not going to capitalize his name" or "I don't drive a Ford, so from now on it will be known as 'mustang'".   Even so, the word "Allah" isn't specific to Islam; it's the Arabic word for "God". Even Arabic Christians and Jews call God "Allah". So, unless Priscilla does not believe in any higher being, Allah  is  technically Priscilla's god.  Ah, but what can one do? Much to my chagrin, I can't spend more than thirty seconds online without coming across this sort of garbage. As a result, I try not to talk much while playing Counter-Strike.  So what does our petulant protagonist do? He proceeds to make Priscilla eat hot lead, four rounds straight. Doesn't that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?  The End.
