Even if we learn to tolerate, There will always be hate, It may not be about race, gender, or sexuality, But it will always have some sort of personality. This evil feeling inside, Will never abide To the will of the light... Constantly it'll hide, But later on, it'll prepare for it's ride. Corrupting thoughts, Sometimes twisting realities, Blinding our eyes once open... Tainting us with its damnation. We will always be tainted by it, Seldomly commanding us at what it sees fit. We may sometimes be able to fight it, Seldom we may be able to resist it, But there is always one thing certain... We could never deny it. We may want to lie about this shit, But the truth will preside... That you could never hide... The surface is where the truth will always preside, Finding its way out of the bide, To reveal what we could never put aside, That there will always be hate, No matter what anyone does, No matter what everyone will do, The walls we build... It could always penetrate through... Creating chaos, mass chaos... Inside our hearts, towards each other, We could never prevail, Our combined strength is of no avail, It will always find a way To taint... To constantly taint... Never will it faint, It will continue its eternal quest To swallow us in its darkness, To let us see what it has constantly tried to show, Its constant sorrow... Its eternal woe... Its damnation... Its hate.
