Speaking of how I am, or rather waht i did, I spent my half day at the mall with Kaylee.  more on this at the lobby.  Props to Michael for burning the soundtrack to Lost in Translation for me. Awsome set of tunes. (  Sophia: Thanks, I owe it all to chlorine and spin-drying my hair.   Michael: you're right.  It would be odd. To begin with, anyway. I'm trying to imagine you in the same room with Patty and Jen   Nate: I consider your silence a personal victory.    Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?
