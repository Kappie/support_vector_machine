I got this feeling that today is the last time Dad is going to 883 with me and Mother. Meow moo! Hmm...I ate duck porridge. I brought 8 Days and Lime (Wendy recommends the Poly section. Might as well check it out). As usual, I read 8 Days while walking around la. We met my grandmother. Meowing moo! We came back at 10.30.  When I logged into MuggleNet Interactive, there's a new message for me. It looks like I has just gotten my first piece of assignment. I signed up as a beta reader for aspiring authors, and one of them owled me her story.   Well, it seems like we haven't gotten off to a good start. The story, basically, sucks. Grammar errors were abundant! She claimed to have spell-checked her work, but what she doesn't know is that the computer spell-checker wouldn't catch offending words like "hare" (she means hair) and "new" (knew). I think Mr Tsung will vomit blood all over his desk after reading the original story. Yes, it was that bad. If you say the grammar is the worst, wait till you read the plot. Hermione tuned punk and vain to the point of ugliness, Draco fell in love with Hermione, and the worst is that Harry and Herimone had sex while Hermione was consoling Harry about Sirus's death. Harry even greeted Hermione by kissing her on the cheek. Oh my god...such deformation of our beloved characters. This story is a disaster!  Of course, in my reply, I didn't tell her that. Although I felt like doing a Simon Cowell on her, I gently pointed her to her mistakes. I showed her where she went wrong and how she could improve. I even said "I look forward to reading your work again". HaHa! Okay, I don't really look forward to that, but I do look forward to reading her reply. How meowful!   Okay...I ate nasi lemak for lunch, chatted with XC, then went to play my game. Oh my. It looks like my father got his taxi back today. Ooooo! My feeling was right! :D How meowful.   Hmm...bascially, after that, was more Internet surfing, bathing and eating dinner. Oh my meow. It looks like WQ is joining me, Amanda and Wendy to visit NP and SP for their Open Houses tomorrow. How mooing.   Okay. i end le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
