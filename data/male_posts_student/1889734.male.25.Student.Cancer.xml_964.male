Todd was referring to John Kerry's quote: "I believe I can fight a [...] more sensitive war on terror [...]"   Here's a little snippet of Todd's thoughts on this quote:  Todd:   Regardless of what he meant, does he really want to tie the words 'sensitive' and 'war' together in one neat little bundle? Are the American people interested in being 'sensitive' as we try to protect our way of life? Keep talking John. I thought Bush had the monopoly on entertaining speech.   Well, not to worry Todd. The president took hold of that monopoly the very next day:   "Now in terms of the balance between running down intelligence and bringing people to justice obviously is -- we need to be very  sensitive  on that." --G.W. Bush, August 7, 2004.  And, before Mike calls me out on it,  urlLink here's the source .  I'll also add this Bush quote as a comment in that post. I just wanted to make sure you saw it.
