Some days I'm literally dragging myself out of bed and can barely function, then other days I go 24 hrs with no sleep.  So last night Flo accidentally called me Steff when I IMed her. I'm sure it's possible she could have read it Stefferboy or something like that in the midst of major AIMing. However, you would think that the -boy part would signify that I'm not our girly friend. I jokingly asked Steff if I should be offended that Flo called me that. Her response was, "Hey, I'm offended that you'd be offended if someone called you Steff. I rule." This is the 2nd time someone has called me Stephanie this year. Those bastarrds in AM Radio did it this summer!   Sorry Steff, but Alberts rule more than Stephanies.  I have class at 4:25 today. I need to brush up on my readings for today's mock trial on Althusser. I got the basics of the arguments down, but I don't have indepth grasp of it. I also need to photocopy stuff for class tomorrow and do my readings for Weber. I'd rather sleep though. I just had another massive burrito for lunch.  I've been listening to a lot of  Pulley  and  Me First And The Gimme Gimmes  lately.  **
