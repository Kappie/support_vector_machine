The below post from the newsgroup alt.politics.homosexuality is the type of person you will be supporting if you believe the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that this ilk intend to spread. Their message isn't pro-life but pro-big government, pro-police state, pro-theocracy. Don't let this ilk take over the US, vote for Kerry, even if you don't like him. At least if you boot GWB out now, hopefully the Republicans will come to their senses and realise that the religious right shouldn't have a monopoly of influence over the party and in fact, should be kicked out in favour of a return to the  TRUE  values of conservatism.

You bastards spit on everything else that is kind and moral and decent and good. Why not?   > If there really were justice, you're children would be gay.  My KIDS were raised with MORALS and STANDARDS. They were taught to hate queers and other inferiors at an early age. So now, there's NO hang-ups in those areas! The problem with people like you is that you were never raised with any solid right-vs-wrong standards. You are a product of your parent's sick generation. The "If it feels good, do it" crowd. That's your problem. Keep on 'doin' it' and maybe AIDS will get ya'. One less mental FREAK to have to deal with.  The one ray of sunshine here is that you won't breed. Not unless you get into the Boy Scouts or something.  IBen G.
