Maybe it was a phase or something for the others, but i know i'm defnintly going to continue putting in entries.  well, let's see...what has happneed worth mentioning....o, well, now that i'm sayig stuff, i must admit i HAVE tried to put in miore entries, but i only have SOO much time anymore to do it, so for now on i'm goin to try to update every weekend or half days (like tomarrow...SCORE) anyway, i guess it's worth mentioning i was SERIOUSLY late for the last 3 days of school last week.  First day cause my parents thought i had an appointment, but didn't, the second cause i acutally had an appointment, and the third, cause....shit, i can't even remember....o yeah! i was trying to put on my contacts that i got the day before, but took too long.  Anyway, after that was the crazy cult meeting of Antioch (hence the title)  Now, let me start off by saying, i really hated the sound of antioch. i mean, everyone that talked about it (rob, jorge, dan) mad it sound like a freaking cult and some kinda sick and demented place...and ofcourse, everyone else (me, andy, jones, and prolly more) were inclined to make fun of it with names like Anticock, and shit like that. Jorge appeared to be cool with it, but i'm sure he wasn't, dan didn;t really care, and rob i think hated it, cause he knew we were making fun of something that we didn;t even know the first thing about. Well, fast foward to last week, and i get a call on the phone, as i'm getting ready to go to the gym.  It's jorge with rob and dan, and they have a "surprise" for me.  Now, when i heard that he was with the other guys, i was thinking the worst...like there with there anitoch buddies to come over and like, do some stupid shit to me....quite the contrary though.  They dropped off one of the most important permission slips of my life.   They needed more people for the antioch weekend, and me being there freind, and them thinking i would atleast enjoy it, came and dropped of the sheet asking me to come.  The cost was 45 bucks, and from what i read, not worth it.  But throughout the week, i found out that more freinds were going, and that ofcourse, made me wanna go.  By friday, a large cirlce of freinds have already heard of what was going down, and wanted to come along as well, but they didn't go, the slips were do that tuseday or soemthing.  well, ya, like i said, totally negative feelings for the place, and juss all that mess.  That week i had also been to the gym every single day, and friday wasn;t an exception.  I got there with an hour to sepnd, 5 to six.....which would give me am hour to pack, and get over there.  I get that done (barely) and call andy for a ride....u see, at the gym he said if i needed one, to catch one with him.  So, itook him up on the offer, and got over there.  I rang the door bell like 5 times, and didn't get any response.  I saw both of his cars, and his lights and tv on, but none of them acutally in the house.  I thought they juss left, and took his dads summer car out for a spin, so, kinda dissapointed, i go over to brassier swiss to use the pay phone to call my dad who juss dropped me off, to come pick me up.  Well, i know, i know, i didn;t know how to get there, but before i called andy, i called jorge, and he gave me failry easy directions to get there, so i did.  we drive, and sure enough, i happen to see a school through the trees, and i knew it was it, my dad had even been there before, so everything went fine...i was alittle late, but not compared to some other people. I get there, and its juss awsome.  If you didn;t already know, i love the public, and i juss love bieng with and infront of people.  I go in there with a vengence, and meet like, prolly most of them.  Acouple i stayed away from, i was kinda shy and/or not paying attention to them.  But ya, it turned out great.  We had to go around doing some stuff....im not gonna say wat, cause that would ruin the next one for whoever wants to go.  After that, we go to a our designated sleep groups to go to our guest house.  We had the smallest sleep group with 3, me, vinny, and Gonzalo.  It was real cool....we didn;'t have as much fun as i thought we were, but none-the-less, great times.  Next day, realy early, like 7, the day started again.  This time, it kinda freaked me out.  See, we have to hold hands, and sing woreshipping songs, and at first, i not only felt left out, and freaked out, but also like i had to get outa there.  After that, a person goes up to do a talk about a certain subject that they were giving.  Rob's had to be the mot entertaining, and is was about how god has chosen us for certain things. After talks we go to ur discussion groups, and talk answer questions and discuss things on kinda the same subject the talk was on.  Well, once again, my group was the smallest, but still awsome, kayci acutally headed it up, and we were  always  the first one done...so we played basketball till someone told us to stop, and go back to the talk room and do it all over again. Thats pretty much the jist of it...i'm not gonna type anymore cause it'll juss ruin it i guess...it didn;t ruin the experince for me even though i knew alot of things, but i dun wanna make it a habit to tell everyone...well, ya, during that whole thing, you change.  You leave with soooooo much knowledge, and so many new feinds, and so many new ways to look at people, it really was a awsome time, no matter what i thought about it in the beggining.  Still don't belive me? well, let me share a moment that happened to that with out a doubt gave me some closure.  It was confessional time, where preists come for you to go, and confess, or juss to talk.  I of course, loving and for of opinions, wanted to go, but i had no idea what to say, i really didn;t have anything to confess....it prolly would have taken awhile anyway....i need something to ask him, something i needed to have answered, and i thought it....i needed  faith . i needed something.  U see, all the stuff they were saying, i already did, but i would NEVER connect ANYTHING with god, or let alone any kinda religion, and being there made me want to see what i really wanted.  well, i walk in, and juss begin to cry my eyes out...i felt sooooooo lost....i told him, i need some kind of faith, some guidance...i had nothing...he asked me if i loved anyone....i said (barely...i litterally couldn;t talk i was crying so much) that ofcourse i did, my parents, and my brothers.  He then asked me if i had faith  in them,  and i said yes.  He then asked me, why do i love them, how do you get to love someone, and i answer you have to know them first....and thats when it hit me....he told me to have faith in something, more specifically this religion, i have to get to know it, i have to understand it, i have to love it first.  He told me to read the gospel of luke first, very slowly, and soak up everything.   I still haven;t done it, but that definitly ggave me some closure.  i walk back, and tell sabby and i think mike about what happend.  I see this spanish chick i haven;t met yet, and juss sit next to her...i asked if she's ok, cause she had her head down, and after that we juss talked....for a LONG time...it was incredible, this girl is the completly TOTAL package, it's the most amazing thing i had ever seen in my life....but what amazed me the most was that i wasn't even intrested in doing something wiht her...i juss wanted to talk....sure i kinda got close, and RALLY felt like making out with her, but i mean, i was so caught up in the conversation, that was like, not even worth it.  Well, i call a freind over, to meet this truly amazing girl, and he too is amazed.....i'm positive he has feelings for her, and rightfully so, they do have ALOT in common.  I wasn't mad or something evenm though i kinda liked her too...i guess i juss excepted that he'll  be a better match them me.  Anyway, i hope he gets what he wants, cause that would be awsome. and no, i'm not gonna tell you who it is....but ya, thats juss one example of  many  that i could mention.  I mean, the whole place is filled with love....if somoene is crying, everyone goes and gives him/her a hug, and it's juss that kinda atmosphere.  I would explain some of the amazing stuff that happened, but we all excepted a confidentiality rule that i won't break...so sorry.  Any way, fast foward to today, and more stuff happens.  We go to the croton diner where they always go after a weekend to juss chill some more, and relax...ya, we were skipping school....but it didn;t matter.  After that, we decide to go to the dam, cause that's also tradition.  We make a quick stop at this kid's derek's house, then get there.  we kinda juss hang around, and then decide to go to croton point park.  On the way back, we stop by dereks again, and head out.  half way going in, we see michelle drive past us, going outa the park, we asked what was going on, and it turned out a frind had gotten into a accident.  We head over there, kinda worried, and make it.   We find out that it wasn;t nearly as bad as we thought, but the driver was still severly shaken by the whole event.  Well, after that, we relaxed, and decided to head over to jorges.  And well, we do, all of us get there, and we juss chill, some listne to music upstairs, others play games downstairs, juss stright foward chillen. i had to go alittle early for a dentist appointment, which litterally took like 3 seconds, and then ate at the chinese place....my mom leaves cause she has to, and leave me and my little brother alone...he ends up walking to his freinds house, and i walk home, fairly quikly, trying to get home to call jorge, to maybe get a ride, so i can continue to chill.  Well, everyone left, and now i'm here, typing this.....but even me being back home still hasn't changed the extreme changes i have gone through.  I'm a firm beliver of astrology, and today was such a confirmation that it was true...to atleast a certain extent....let me give you the examples.
