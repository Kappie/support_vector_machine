A tv show on the abc is being taped for  someone who doesn't live here . The tape was bought especially for this purpose, and an entire trip to the supermarket was based on this need. Last time I asked for a tape to record some  quality  broadcasting, such as  Frasier , all I get is a "Don't we have any other tapes?" Oh, silly me, I asked for a tape WHEN I DIDN'T NEED ONE!!!! Anyway, I endeavoured to find out how long this program was going to go. And in the meantime I thought I might as well transpose some of my indignancy. My answer is "It finishes at 8:30 I think." Thank you so much. And why is the vcr I use being used to record such mindless drivel that would appear on a Sunday night on ABC? Because it's the only one connected to a tv that gets reception. You would think a multi-k dollar home entertainment system would be granted a  humble video cassette recorder  but no. So I'm writing this.  Also, what's the point in notifying which students are the top ten in their year level, without telling them what position? Enough information to exclude and potentially  damage  other students, but not enough to gloat over the other contestants for the fabled  best in the whole god damned year level  position.  I tell you, the world is screwy.
