Nope, I am fascinated by feces, for reasons I can only blame human genetics and the total lack of inhibitions of my high school mates for.  I'm not interested in touching it, playing with it, hurling it...it's much more in an abstract, theoretical sense, or from the anecdotal standpoint.    How so?  Well, this afternoon I enjoyed a lunch at West Duke's Armadillo Grill, grabbing two fajita tacos and eating with several of the TIP Leadership staff.  We chatted for about 30 minutes, after which the pot started to rumble.  I got up to leave and use the bathroom near the exit, but it was busy, and this was a dump not for the faint of heart.  So I quickly descended two flights of stairs and found a bathroom nestled away in this large union center.  And I let it go.  but halfway through, two people walked in, and I had to stop mid-sentence and wait for them to finish (maybe I'm poo-shy).  They left, I finished and found my way to the bus.    I don't know why, but it wasn't until I reached the bus stop that I realized how courageously awesome a shit I had just embarked on.  The high school folks and I often talk about the great shits, or the ones you remember fondly...they make your eyes roll into the back of your head, and you lick your lips and pull them under your teeth, shaking your head in an asymmetrical rhythm, and suddenly you're doing the Bill Cosby jello pudding dance.  And there is no part better than the realization...few things are more envigorating than realizing you owe your ass a thank you note.
