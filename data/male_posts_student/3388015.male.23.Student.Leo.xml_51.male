Luke, Laura, and I went to the East End Festival. (East End? Like in London? Oh, that's right. Whenever I go to Downtown Rochester, it takes me right to London's East End.  Pip pip, cheerio, and all that rubbish .)  We visited Wayne (owner of Golden Port) at his stand. Laura bought some food and as usual, I ate free. Set up a man's overly complicated aquarium once and never pay for food again. Works for me.   We walked around and avoided some of Rochester's finest trash. Here is an excerpt of an actual conversation I had as we were leaving:   Man:  pssssssst  Me:  Oh, hey! (I actually knew him). You got your tooth back!  Man:  Yeah, I got it back nine months ago!  How exciting. This guy got his tooth back, and we were both so happy. [I slap my forehead as I reach for my customized tooth whitening trays]  I am a bad, horrible person. My formerly unspoiled unjudgemental friend (Luke) has become a snob, and I think it's all my fault. Now we both hate our not-white-enough teeth, our not-thin-enough bodies, and our not-long-enough hair.   Luke:  Now I know where all our weight went.  Wow. That was soooo bad. That's like the pot calling the kettle a snob. Seriously.  Vodka is my new boyfriend. Until the next one.
