Going out with friends heaps and also trying to keep up with my forum and the now 3 RPG's im in which is one Charmed one and two Roswell ones, yeah I just can't seem to find time. But here I am.   Today I saw Spiderman 2. It was awesome. Then I went to Bruno's after for his birthday. It was fun.   Ooooo Mel and I are going to start recording our dreams like remembering them and writing them down. My one from last night is...   I was at school, and it was strange because it wasn't like our normal school. We were doing PE on the oval, and we had our schoolbags with us. I took a spraycan out of my bag and started spraying people. And what did the spray do, you may ask? It made their mobile phone ring, and made them answer it. Yes, that was my own minds creation. Extremely weird. So I sprayed a few people and it made their phones ring. Even funnier was that the spray also made them answer it, so they got into trouble by the teacher. Then I kept spraying Matt Grech and annoyed the hell out of him. Then suddenly I was walking home from school. Strangely, the sidewalks and streetlamps were very good looking and it seemed like they had been fixed up considerably. This was about 7pm, so it was dark. I kept walking home and then when i got about half a dozen houses away I noticed primary school kids playing in the streetlight. I kept walking home and realised there were year 11 and 12's playing in next door (my grandparents ((who weren't living there according to my dream -- there was no house)) )'s front yard in the light of a streetlamp. I kept walking 'till I got to my house and noticed my brother and his friends playing in the front yard. I walked into the house, which miraculously changed into a new great house. it was unbelievably cool, and my memories suddenly changed and I remembered we just moved here. Then I walked in and my mum had visitors. They were neighbours who were welcoming us. I said hi and went up to my new room and then...I... woke up!  Yeah...pretty weird...It's 1:30am now and i'm a bit tired and it's raining a bit. I might go to bed. Cya!
