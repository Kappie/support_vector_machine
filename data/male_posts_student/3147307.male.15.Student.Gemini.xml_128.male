What a change in a 24 hour period. And then Patrick about an hour after we got home from Calvin left to go to an overnight CYPU meeting at northside, and today went straight from the meeting to a robotics-sponsored car wash. He is sound asleep right now! I slept in till 12:15 today! Wow - haven't done that in years! Last night we watched  To End All Wars.  I'd give it ***1/2 stars. Great movie w/ obvious Christian themes. It is rated R for war violence and strong language. It is the same setting as  The Bridge on the River Kwai  except this is more the true story of what really happened. It's one of those movies you watch once because it is a good movie, but don't watch again because you'd rather not watch the gore (especially when you know that it really happened) again. On a lighter note, I can consider myself an international Bible quiz bowl champ (along w/ Joe, Allen, and Zach)  - lets forget the fact that I answered all my questions wrong in the final round.   A picture of us is on the front page of the  urlLink International Conference  home page (its one of me giving the wrong answer.)
