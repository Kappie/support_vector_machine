I'd now like to talk about an individual who has recently passed away due to Cancer.   urlLink Kevin , aka Talon Squad Leader.... Kevin has passed away recently due to serious health problems. I never had the pleasure of knowing this individual but nonetheless his death hit us all hard at  urlLink TFN . From what i hear, he is a great individual in general. Although only 22, he shared some traits that some would consider absurd. For a young man, he had exceptional priorities. The one who originally broke the news...a close friend of his,  urlLink Vertical . You can read a remap of his thread  urlLink here . Godspeed, Kevin.
