Great movie, Michael Moore is truly a genius with his writing and ideas. He did a great job of explaining all sorts of political stuff (which helped because I left the theater knowing SO much about all this shit that's been going on) and I can easily say he did a great job of making Bush look bad and his regime. I wish could see the look on Bushes face when he sees this film. I mean, there’s SO much that I wanna talk about this film, but I really don’t wanna spoil it for you, so drop off a comment if ya have any feedback on the movie or your thoughts!   Go see the movie! You’ll love it! If you’re anti-Bush I shouldn’t need to tell you to see it, because I know I am!   Vote Michael Moore 2004!
