A caring friend told me to write a song to help let out the feelings, and move on from things.  Easier said than done!  My poetry has never been much, and song writing is the same but with music (argh!!) so I spent last night lying in bed looking for the words to say why Hate and love are the same thing in many cases, and why I would do anything to spread a relationship thats wafer thin over even more time. I like what I have so far, it's crap, and musically it uses my four least favourite minor chords (can you have favourite chords?) but it's better than bottling up like normal.  I stole the title from this blog to give me a start, a short summer relationship song? perfect I think! But then I couldn't figure out to go, I knew it would be 2 or 3 verses, with a chorus and bridge, but orders, arrangements, lyrics even, were too much. I chose a song to base mine on (thank you to Brand New's classic 'Quiet Things That Noone Ever Knows') and followed the plan. Verses 1+2 out the way, chorus finished, but what about the bridge???  I know it's sad, but the bridge is my favourite bit of any song. It reminds me of myself, i guess. It doesn't quite fit, it's a bit different, but people still like it at the end of the day, and it's allowed to hang out with the rest of the song. And I cannot write one! It's ridiculous, but I cant see the song with it, and I can't see it without.  I think this may be too much of a challenge for aych an amateur singer songwriter, but I'm going to keep on plugging. Back to my title, in a quest to find a song structure and musical sound to say how I feel, I realised something terrible. My favourite songs on my PC at the moment are Sting, and Busted!! Neither are cool for a 17 year old 'punk, rock and stuff' fan to listen to, so what am I to do? I think I'm just going to admit defeat, and take it like a man: OK, I said it, I like a busted song!!!!!  That'll do for now, I think - today I was listening to Harry Shuttleworths EP 'Widescreen dreams' {www.harryshuttleworth.com}  stay cool kiddies x x
