Cool thing is I'm happy, happier than I have been the past month. Owell getting to the point.  What is boredom really? Is it a Human invention? Is it instinctive? Where does this phenomanon come from? I have no idea, but I do have my points. I beleave boredom is a human creation, somebody invented it, without thinking of what might happen. What did the cavemen do? They did not know boredom, because they did not know how it is without boredom. Same goes for animals, their lives are so boring, but they are not bored, because they don't know a better feeling. So is anything that enlightens you a bad thing? Not neccesarally, but don't go and enjoy yourself to much, if you know it won't last long. For it will just cause boredom, even if that action was fun before knowing a better one.   So what am I saying? Boredom is a creation if you enjoy what your doing to much at a particular time...
