I was meant to be the confirmed CO president! Argh... yup! You heard me! The president! Man... wah lau eh, anyway, how did i find out?! Ms Too and Mdm Peck told me! So frustrating! Grr!!! Anyway, it so happens that cause of my poor results (thanks to the fact that i didn't study), they had causes for fear that made their decision of wanting to make me president waver! ARGH! Yes! i have to admit! I do want to be the president!  Anyway, what happens now is that, i am now assured a top 3 position in the CO, that means... President, Vice-President or Secretary... but than... oh man! i should be made the president lah! Admittedly, my results ain't that fantastic! But... at least i am seriously making an effort now right?! Trust me lah! Anyway, if i don't make it as the President, i am going to give them my best, do well for my results and show everyone that they have made the wrong choice! Shut their mouths up! Damn it! i am meant to be the President! Argh...  oh well... no point crying over spilled broth now right? haiz... oh well... nevermind, let me just give my best for CO lah... just hope that if anyone else becomes president, let him be sane and not crazily or fanatically over practice minded or else we'll just die! Argh... man... to think that both the teachers were so in high regards of me, and yet, just because of my dumb mistake... my position is questionable now... oh well...  With regards to Kelly? i don't know anymore... very tired, supposed to pass her something, yet haven't been able to get the chance too... oh well... anyway, just hope that she takes care lah... yup... besides that, what can i actually say? i just hope that she totally understands everything that i feel soon... don't actually know how much longer i can hang on, cause, though i will be here for her, just being there for her... but still... oh well... nevermind, i'll just be there for her...  To everyone else, especially people that are down? well... i just want you guys to know, that everyone have their bad days as seen from my above! But guys, don't give up and be happy ok? remember the good times and away with the bad! Know what's been good and forget the bad! yup! haha... or, if you want, just be like me, thrash it out on the court or scream it out and you'll feel better! so yeah... do take care okay guys! If you ever need anything... just find me! Smile! Live Life To The Fullest! Stay Optimistic! :p
