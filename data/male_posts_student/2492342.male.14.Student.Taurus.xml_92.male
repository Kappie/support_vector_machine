Often I went on walks with my friends and played games in the park. I read books for hours on end and would run outside to throw around a ball whenever I could. Every summer my family and me went on long trips to Europe or Mexico, and often we would visit my family in Iran. We went to the beach and to the old palaces, rejoicing in the vastness of the beautiful Caspian and the grandeur of the imperial residences. I played with my cousins and would always returned home joyful. My life seemed perfect, like a dream. Yet for every dream, there is an accompanying nightmare, and mine would happen much sooner than I could have thought.  One day my best friend Akbar was shot in the chest as he walked along a South LA street. That day, my life changed forever. The world became morbid and bitter; everything was dark and ruined for me. I sat for hours in silence, thinking about what was left around me. I remember, a few days after his death, a friend of my father’s was deported for little reason, something that would not have mattered if he had been, say, from Britain. The lack of justice shocked me. The world seemed hopeless. We were living on borrowed time. I remember on one of my trips to Tehran, I was walking along a small street while my cousin Morvarid rode her bike up and down. I saw something moving around at the end of the street and ran towards it. When I got there, I realized it was a small mouse caught in a trap. It squirmed and cried out to me for help, but all I could do was watch in silence. It slowly died, absorbing all the pain possible from the cruel wooden death cell. I stood there stunned for a few minutes to grasp what had happened before me. Years later, after my best friend’s death, this is what I would feel like: a mouse trapped with no escape, dieing from torture for a reason I did not understand.  For two weeks or so all I could do was sit around. I have little memory of this painful time, but I remember that everyone around me tried to cheer me up to no avail. I was lost to the world. Darkness encompassed my being, and there was no light left for me to find.  I was completely and utterly alone.   Some three weeks after Akbar’s death we decided to go to my friend’s house in the countryside around La Paz, El Salvador. The plane ride seemed interminable to everyone around me, but to me, time was no object. I had sat around in the house for hours before, how was a plane any different? We arrived in San Salvador at around 5:00 and from the airport we took an old bus through the mountains and countryside to La Paz. The darkness was lifted at around six or so, but traffic kept us going until thirteen o’clock and some. The old, bumpy mountains had tired me and made my thigh numb; I was very relieved to arrive. For two weeks we stayed there, walking to the beach and having picnics in the beautiful grass fields around Ceci’s village. We walked around the town, reconnecting with friends from our previous visits. I remained distant throughout the trip, and it was not until the last day that I began talking to our old friends. That night was a Friday; I stayed awake until 5 or so in the morning talking to one of my friends, Karmen. We talked about how things had been and what we hoped for the future and everything. I was happy that night, for the first time in over a month. When morning came, my parents came and told me it was time to go. I cried and yelled so violently that they backed off and said they would come to me in an hour. I immediately knew that now was the time to avoid my certain fate. I ran to Karmen’s house, a small cottage on a hill surrounded by grass and flowers, and started knocking loudly. She came to the door and I quickly explained to her what I desired- relief from the Samsara my life had become in Los Angeles. She turned and told her mother she’d be back later before walking out of her house and running to a nearby hill overlooking the ocean. We sat there for a few minutes until she told me it was time to go. We then walked down to the shore and started walking north westish; she joked that it would only take a few weeks to walk me home. Around noon we walked into a nearby village called Zacalouteca and went to a small café in someone’s front yard. We ate there and sat for a few hours, talking about what we would do when we returned to Yanetzal, our village. Around fifteen o’clock we went to sleep on a patch of thick grass in a corner of the town. I slept for three hours before she woke me up; “¡Ya está noche, regresamos!” “It’s late, we have to get home.” I agreed, and we began walking back. We returned a few hours later, after sunset, and we went to our own houses and fell asleep. I would stay there for one week more before finally coming back to Los Angeles.  I had been awoken from my sleep, and both my dream and my painful nightmare were over. I was numb.  School started again a week after we got back. I do not remember that first quarter, those first few weeks, and I assume they had no impact on me. Yet the worst was over. And my life had begun again. Things were different, changed. I was changed. The naïve, innocent boy of childhood was gone, and I was replaced. I was changed, yet for the better or worse I am still not sure.     I dont know how to end it. and it was in nice font. Bellgothic bt.   im in class so now i gotta go.   MUCH LOVE  peace  ~alex
