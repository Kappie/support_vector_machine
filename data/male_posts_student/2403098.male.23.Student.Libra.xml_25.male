I know, it's not like I have been off of it for weeks or anything, but at least it's a start.  Even the diet ones, as I've been told forever and refused to believe, pack on the poundage.  Four days of like zero to maybe 1 diet coke, and I loose five pounds, maybe it's not a coincidence.  Speaking of coke, a Texas-ism, or Texism, or taxidermy, er somethin is to call every soda a "coke."  So pardon me when I say "I stopped drinking cokes," and I really mean "I stopped drinking anything carbonated and caffeinated.  DO YOU KNOW how big of a deal that is for me though?  I LIVE in a coke (again, that's soda) can practically.  What do I do when I'm planning on even driving across town?  Stop at the gas station for a coke.    Oh good, now onto gas stations, and by the way thanks for joining me on this ride around and around and around in circles that is my mind.  The other day I went into the gas station here by my parents house, and paid for my gas, and that of my brother's on the same card.  The lady behind the counter looks out the window and goes "that your brother..?"  (in a very half mexican/half chinese accent, I'm not sure WHAT this woman was).  I was like "yes.." she goes "oh, he break my friend heart."  I'm like "he break your friend heart?  Who your friend."  Anyway, she goes "oh I don't know her name, but he break her heart, they supposed to get marry."  For those of you who don't know,  my brother was engaged to a psycho-bitch for about, oh, 6 months or so.  I hope she stumbles her sorry ass upon this blog-post, SOMEHOW, and reads this.  If you do stumbled upon this, Jessica, make sure to introduce yourself to your "friend" the China-mexican at the Diamond Shamrock on Austin Highway, cool? cause that bitch doesn't know your name, yet claims ya'll be friends.    Anyway, so it was quite funny that the lady at the gas station knew all kinds of information but NOT really.  Apparently her "friend" who will be my brother's ex, and my brother came into this particular gas station all the time.  Apparently that made her friends with the girl, yet she doesn't know her name.  I should drop her a lil' memo, that her 'friend' heart get break because her 'friend' be psycho.  Don't take it personally, gas station lady, but they came in there because the station was convenient to their homes, not cause ya'll were tight.  Shit, I've been in there twice since I've been here in Texas, do you think I am now her friend?  She might be rooting me on to law school by now, letting every lotto ticket purchaser know that her friend is on his way to Oklahoma tomorrow.  HELL, maybe by now she's got kids with my name.  Wait she doesn't know names.  In other news, Whoopi does a slim fast commercial now, and the clever phrase is when she says "if I can be a big loser, than so can you."  WAIT WAIT, Whoop, does that mean that I can literally be as big of a loser as you?  Do I get to have a 'one-hit-wonder' style movie career and a rocky road into the sitcom world with flopping one-liner TV programs?  HELL YEAH I'm gonna buy slimfast.  (note to self:  phone the CEO of Slim Fast and advise him against hiring worthless spokespeople)
