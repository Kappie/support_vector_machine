If you don’t want to have so many different posts for your photos, you can merge them all into one by simply cutting the HTML from the post, deleting the post, and merging them all together into one giant post.  An example of how this is done is seen in today’s “The Blog of the Bagel,” where I edited all the pictures of my New York Pictures post into one.  Here’s how you do it:  1- You’re going to need two internet explorer (or other browser) windows open, and ready to go.   2- First, upload all of your pictures using the BloggerBot on Hello. 3- Now, your first internet explorer window will pop up, showing you your blog and the picture you just posted. 4- In that window, go to your dashboard by going to www.blogger.com, and selecting the blog you want to edit (in my case, it was The Blog of the Bagel).   5- Now, go to the Posting tab in your settings, and select Edit Posts. 6- Click on the edit button next to the caption you typed in Hello, in your edit posts menu.  Now, here is where you can take 2 paths.  You can either keep the post with the picture in it, and add the rest of the pictures you want in that post to that, or, you can cut the HTML that contains the picture and insert it into a new post.  7- This is the part where you will need to open your second browser window.  Go to File, New, or whatever, and direct to Blogger.com, if it doesn’t automatically redirect when you open the window. 8- Now, start a new post.  Put in your title, and all that good stuff. 9- If you want to type an introduction to the post, do that first. 10- Now, paste your HTML into the new post. 11- Now, go back into Hello, upload your next picture, and do it again. 12- When you’re all done going into each photo’s post, copying the HTML, and posting it into the new post, post your new post, publish your blog, and then, click on the “Edit Posts” tag.  Now, delete all of the posts that your pictures were originally on.  Republish your blog again, and guess what?  You’re done.  It’s the easiest and cleanest way to manage pictures in your posts, in my opinion, and it’s a good way to organize your pictures. ------------------------ Daily Wrap-Up: June 26, 2004  Well, today, we gave some pretty high scores, and ended the week on a positive note, but don’t expect it to stay that way, because Monday’s download of the day could possibly make you sick!  But, let’s go ahead and do the wrap up.    In game reviews, I reviewed Text Twist on Yahoo Games.  On a positive side, the game is fun, has a nice interface, and is great to play with friends.  On the negative side, if you’re playing by yourself, it seems incredibly boring.  I gave Text Twist a  4 out of 5.   Today’s download of the day was Hello.  This helpful little tool provides the easiest way to upload pictures to your Blogger, as well as share them with your friends.  It’s just like a photo-based version of AOL Instant Messenger, with a nice interface and a great speed.  Hello got a  5 out of 5.   The site of the day was a place called www.shockwave.com.  This site features the best web games, a hilarious selection of online films through Atom Films, and is one of the best web sites that I have ever been to.  I gave Shockwave.com the rarest score you’ll ever see...a  6 out of 5.   And, finally, today’s tip was how you can move your photos on Blogger to one individual post, if you so desire.  This tip is for users of Blogger, with the help of Hello.    That’s all for today’s bagel.tech updates.  Remember, I don’t update this one on Sunday, so I’ll be back on Monday with more, including the first item to get a  0 out of 5.  Be sure to check out the links section, and the new “Review summary” portion of the sidebar so you can see what I recommend more than anything else.  It updates every Saturday, after the week is over, so be sure to check it out.  Thanks for checking out bagel.tech, and remember to check out The Blog of the Bagel later for tonight’s post.
