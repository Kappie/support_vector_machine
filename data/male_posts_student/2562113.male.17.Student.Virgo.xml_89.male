Just found my sword.. training with it right now at 2:43 am...   Elrond: Anduril, flame of the west, forged from the shards of narsil. The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walk this earth.  Aragorn: Sauron will not have forgotten this sword...  Elrond: Put aside the ranger. Become who you were born to be. I give hope to men.  Aragorn: I keep none for myself.     SMUTTY weekend coming up.. see you all soon!
