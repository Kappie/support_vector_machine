A total impossibility I know, but the real issue here is who made/makes a better prez.  The article buttresses what I suspected all along when comparing the two:  Reagan was a conservative, but when it came to walking v. talking he chose the latter, at least on social issues.  And thus, we have the Great Communicator.  Could I have, I definitely would have voted for Reagan in '80  '84, but I prefer real action to good acting, which is why I think W would receive my vote in a Bush/Reagan face-off.  Ronnie may have been capable of dismantling anyone in a debate and flawless at making the electorate feel warm fuzzies inside, but Bill Clinton could do that too, albeit not as well or as broadly.  But on social issues, Bush 43 has taken more action than did his pop's boss.   W is compared more to Reagan than even his own father, and while Reagan was a much better politician and rhetorician, Bush seems to be more active, which I find to be good strategery.
