Me encantan.  Manda: Wow. Man I don't know what to say. The world has totally gone out and made what is an abomination to the Lord, something we should all accept. As if. What's wrong is wrong, what's right is right. Hello, can we say Sodom and Gemorrah!? Hmmm, I wonder why they were destroyed..... Oh that's right.... HOMOSEXUALITY!!!!! The world (and not just gays) tell us, "You religious bigots need to accept the homosexual lifestyle. Otherwise, it's just like the Nazis!" I say, "BULL!!!!" Nazis? What the heck? (And I'm not saying that everyone thinks this way, but some do) Yes, we do not condone the homosexual lifestyle, yes we believe it's wrong. But do we openly hate gay people? No! Should we hate gay people? No! God loves everyone. So should we. Does this mean that it's okay for people  to be gay? NO!!!! Sodomy is an abomination to the Lord. Check scripture. So, where does this leave us? We shouldn't hate gay people, and yet they practice a lifestyle that is an abomination to the Lord (Yes, I keep saying that). What do we do? Why, we try and show them the truth in love of course! Yes, there are people proclaiming to be Christians that give us true warriors a bad name. But you know what? We need to continue doing what we've been doing. Being a light in a dark world. And if someone ever pulls the Nazi line on you, just bring up how you can't pray in school. Or the whole ten commandments thing. Or maybe you can't even bring a bible to school. Hmmmmmmm, this is odd. Who's the Nazi now?!  Okay, I'm done with that rant now. I want to talk about abortion. Yes, abortion. Big issue. Who supports what? What are your thoughts about it? Morning After Pill, abortion or not? Should we have abortion? What about the right to choose? Shouldn't every woman have the right to choose? Planned parenthood. Abortion vs. Adoption. Risks. Benefits (like there are any). Murder or not? Life? Or blob of tissue? No holds barred guys. Let the posts flow.   Before I go, I want to say that this website thang, is a huge blessing to my life. It's awesome to come here, and just talk about big issue with my friends. Ask for prayer. You guys are a huge blessing to me. I don't know if you'll ever know how much you guy mean to me. Here's a thought though. Each of you has had an impact on my life. You have made a difference. You guys, are partly responsible for the man (kid) of God that I am and am striving to become. So I would just like to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
