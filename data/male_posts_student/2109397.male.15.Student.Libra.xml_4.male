I like the way we play for some reason except sometimes it gets really boring the Cats just seem to make games boring whenever they play. I like the fundamental game they play but they bore it down a lot. This team is probably the worst shooting team we have had in years. It dissappoints me so, but it is getting better.  On another note, I want a job. I need moola and a car...I cant wait to drive I will never be home like ever. Watch the mammy take my keys away for stupid reasons like not doing the garbage and then my sister will get away with a speeding ticket (which already happened). What a whore.
