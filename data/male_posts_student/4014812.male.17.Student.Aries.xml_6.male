Currently I am, sitting here typing this out, eatting some noddley soup and hating the heat. Probably gonna go jump in the pool soon cuz its like 31 degrees right now and im sorry but thats far to hot.   HAHAHA James and Wes had to goto this tournament for tennis today in this scourching heat... I wouldnt be surprised if when they got back they were sunburnt. I laugh now HHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA... sucks to be you guys :D.   Yup... only 14 more days till Calgary, Cant wait. Have to talk to Christian later cuz he needs to get all this information ready otherwise we are gonna have alot of problems coming up in a matter of minutes... and thats just NO GOOD whatsoever.   **EDIT**  Well, Christian decided to come home. Apparently he cant get the day off work cause of some stupid japanese people that are coming to visit the mill he is working at, WHICH IS REALLY FUCKING STUPID CUZ ALL HE DOES IS SWEEP FLOORS! But whatever, I guess hes just gonna have to cut down on his time in Calgary. FUCKING JAPANESE...  Well, we've still gotta talk a little bit later... so ill keep it updateing when I get more info.
