UBC, kits, Boundary Superstore, 33rd and Knight, Oak and Broadway, Vancouver Intl Airport...SW Marine Superstore(trying to get a deal on something... spent more on gas than i would have saved had I actually found what I was looking for).   Other than that it was okay... I've always loved blasting my music for others to hear... i don't know why... I think I must like the "What the hell?" looks... tracks of the day:  ====================================== Dimmu Borgir - Absolute Sole Right Lux Occulta - Library On Fire Iced Earth - Jekyl and Hyde Pantera - War Nerve Pantera - Suicide Note Pt.II (this one's the fuckin shit) Shadows Fall - Flesbold At the Gates - Blinded by Fear ====================================== FnR
