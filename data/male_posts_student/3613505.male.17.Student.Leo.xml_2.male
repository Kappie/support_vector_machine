I ALWAYS do... then again i get intimidated by hotness hahaha no i dont - thing is i don't see this working out but i do want at least a couple of hot makeout sessions..... lol   wow can you tell im a teenager -- haha wait but no no some older people can be such horndogs - other day this one individual.... i wont name names (MT) wanted to *censored* haha and yeah that was great lol ---  SCANDALOUS  hehehe wow i sound so dirty but nothing happened - i gave this person a weird look and got out of there...  hah so funny how you can have complete conversations with your eyes... they're just so expressive... well mine are anyways... i was in a coffee shop the other day and this girl was sitting at a table in front of me... me. reading a book. her.staring off into space... THEN our eyes meet and i wanted to see how long i could hold her gaze- haha we held it for a few seconds and she looked down - hahaha i kept staring and she kept looking up so i couldn't stop grinning.. hahaha mustve creeped her out i thought so i kept reading.. then i spaced out and looked out the window and saw the coolest dog... and i pointd to it with my eyes... yes yes i did... and then i finally asked for her name and ive never seen her again haha - hopefully i'll meet up with her one of these days  wow i keep coming back to write in this -- its so incoherent how ive just started new ideas and such... bah.. there's always a critic... including me.. yeah i dont like the way i write a lot of the time but people seem to enjoy it... well.....  my formal writing anyways - for instance - i wrote this editorial about how the chinese gov't was calling the dalai lama a Quebec Separatist... and i mean the editorial wasn't bad but i couldve done it so much better..... BUT my teacher couldn't stop talking about it... embarrassing... meh it's all good..  i dont think i'll ever see her again... hahaha ill mention reasons later i shouldnt badmouth her - shes a nice lady  hmmm - i have officially killed 20 minutes - only ten more to go before my sexy date calls - oh la la - eww thing is this individual doesnt really have much of a personality so im being very shallow here but i havent had a date in the LONGEST time it's ridiculous ahha so these are just my own mortal, human instincts wanting some contact.  oh la la i am quite the socialite - drinking monday night, movies wednesday night, house party friday night, haha somewhere in between i have my last few exams- hehehe wheee next week will be pretty coolio joolio  well it is nearly 9 and im on the phone with another amigo - i dont wanna stop talking- haha we somehow ended up talking about our future careers as carnies (hahahahaha we both got interviews at the PNE) :p we're so cool  mmmmmmmmmm pizza just got here - oh man - order the hawaiian pig from the flying wedge its so so so so so good - i love it.  mmm well gonna go fight for my piece of this delicious-looking pizza-pie.
