If you own one of these cars or aspire to own one, and take offense at my parody, simply leave a comment ( preferably with lots of cursing and misspelled words ). I will be happy to ignore it.   1910    Henry Ford:  I do say, this "import" from the far-off nation of Japania sure is undoubtedly "fly."  Assistant:  I agree whole-heartedly, Mr. Ford. The Japs claim to have found a way to increase the "pimp" of their Auto-Mobiles.  Henry Ford:  What-what? Come, Assistant! TO THE LABORA-TORY!   Henry Ford:  I've discovered an interesting phenomenon, Assistant. Observe: By attaching bits of this material i call "Plas-tick" to our Auto-Mobiles, we can attract and court fine, "fly" young ladies!  Assistant:  INGENIOUS! I've hung several of Mr. Edison's Amazing Electric Light-Bulbs to the undercarriage of the car!  Henry Ford:  A smashing addition. Now we'll give those lousy Jews what-for.  Henry Ford:  ...   Assistant:  Uhm... Jews, sir?  Henry Ford:  Oh. Did i say Jews? I meant Japs. Now we'll give those lousy Japs what-for.  Assistant:  Oh... kay...    Assistant:  But, Sir! Will the customers want to pay thousands of dollars extra just to make their car look and sound different, without any real changes to how it performs?  Henry Ford:  I challenge you to a duel.   The assistant perished, but Henry Ford never walked again.   End Transmission.
