Strange childhood facts - I had a stuffed dog most of my young life named "fluffer" (I don't believe that it fluffed anything nor was it itself fluffy so I don't know where the name came from) that was brown and had leather on its paws. I think my mother still has it. And the moment everyone has been waiting for... My terrible childhood nickname! When I was a baby my mother would dress me in baby boots for the winter and while she went to fetch a coat I would remove them. I hated wearing boots. And so, paradoxially, I was nicknamed "boots." A name I still cringe at to this day. And another entry: old TV shows! I will make another entry devoted to my favorites when I was very small. I want all of you to add to it. Dammit. If you don't I will hunt you down and force you to listen to country music.
