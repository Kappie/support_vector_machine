[+] smarty jones may have done quite well to capture the kentucky derby and preakness stakes, but unless he wins the grueling  urlLink belmont stakes  on saturday (the longest of the triple crown races at 1.5 miles), he is just another two-hit wonder. over the 5 years, the same horse won the first two legs to fall short at the belmont 3? times, so it's a rather common feat. and smarty's romp at preakness seemed to be due more to mediocrity in the field than actual speed. but if he could win that  urlLink triple crown ...wow, that would be something.   [+] why do the  urlLink olympics  mean so little to nba players nowadays? given, a lot of players have credible reasons to ditch (t-mac getting married, ray allen having a baby, kobe's court problems). besides that, maybe it's the need for recuperation after a grueling season (especially players that went deep into the playoffs). maybe it's the security dangers at athens, as jermaine o'neal  urlLink cites . maybe it's the fear of a poor showing, like the notorious  urlLink 6th place finish  at the 2002 world championships. maybe it's just a lack of respect for the privilege to represent their country for free, when they could be making so much more money restructuring contracts and negotiating trades.   whatever the case may be, let us hope that mike bibby (wavering), stephon marbury, allen iverson (ugh), lebron james, richard jefferson, shawn marion (eh), amare stoudemire (eh), tim duncan and jermaine o'neal (wavering) can bring pride to  urlLink usa basketball  again.
