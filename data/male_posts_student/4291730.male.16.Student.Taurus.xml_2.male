Probably do some more of  urlLink Ground Control 2 . There's a long time til Halo 2...  Revora's server is down, yet again. So no  urlLink Origin / urlLink CNC Guild / urlLink Forums  until it wakes up, which might be a long time. Ah well, there's always  urlLink Sleip's .  A few of the  urlLink bee keepers  have  just  figured out that the  urlLink countdown  will finish for everyone, everywhere at the same time because it works out using their PC clocks.  Always seemed blindingly obvious to me, but there you go.  I'm going to  try  and be up at 6 on Tuesday to be online when the countdown finishes on my PC, but everything will most likely have happened by then with me being in the UK.  Or will I be early?  Can't be pestered figuring it out, but I sure as hell won't be on time.
