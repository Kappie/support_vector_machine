It was just the right amount.  Tyke and Goldilocks have had the same experiences.  Except Tyke hasn't really had too much of anything over a break.  Too little of something but not too much.  He has hung out with people just the right amount.  Today was another example of that.  Tyke got up around noon.  A great time to wake up by the way.  Later on he took a shower.  Much later on.  Like 12:30.  Yeesh!  Then he putzed around for a lot of the day.  But having fun all the while.  He was so not bored that he felt it would be kinda cool to actually start reading the thing he is supposed to read for English over break.  Yeah, he almost read the first couple of lines in it.  Almost, then he got tired of trying to be a non-procrastinator (anticrastinator???).  He played some games and hung out in his downstairs for much of the day watching TV.  He watched some of the All-Star game.  It was pretty good.  Some sick plays as usual.  And a bunch of stupid stuff as usual.  After his dinner Tyke and Macaroon decided that they would hang out.  So Macaroon came over.  They watched some TV and then Kinker came over.  They all watched the all-star game, the Simpsons, and listened to music.  All at the same time.  It was fun.  Then they started playing MOH and they were good.  As usual.  They took out some Oomomos this time instead of the usual Bromleys.  Still a grand affair.  Later on Tyronius came over and brought with him a really good ice cream cake.  It was really good.  Mmmmm.  Tyke, Macaroon, and Kinker all took their hits at it at the same time and it probably looked pretty homosexual as they did it but they didn't care.  They split it up into "equal" portions but since Macaroon got the short end of the cake he started burrowing into Tyke's part cuz he got the most.  A clever cajun that man.  But Tyke still ate his fair share and it was stellar.  Tyronius did a good job of bringing that over from work, for free.  The gang continued to play MOH and then Fejj came over and joined in the fray.  That meant that one player would be sitting out at times.  That created some more competition and the bazooka levels were really a matter of not killing yourself (good advice in any situation really).  After that they played NBA2K3.  They owned as the Sonics and then played each other.  It was Tyke and Kinker as the 50s/60s Legends versus Tyronius, Macaroon, and Fejj as the Orlando Magic.  Needless to say the Legends won.  Bob Cousy had an off night but he still scored 28.  And Strom Thurmond and Don Baylor had very solid performances.  Even the Amed and K-Caj style of play by Bob Petit was solid enough to earn him a double-double.  All in all a good game.  Macaroon and Fejj left after that.  So Tyke, Kinker, and Tyronius played cards.  They played hold'em of course and that was fun.  Then they made their own variation on that game and that was very interesting.  The card games they make up are really quite great.  Quite great indeed.  This break has gotten off to a great start.  Let's keep the days rolling well.
