If you read the situation and are like "Why is that so weird?" that's fine, maybe you just have a less cynical perspective on things than I do. I'm not going to comment on whatever the situation is, I'll just post it and see if you find people as...odd as I do.  I walk into Subway to get a meatball sub because I just filled up one of those free 6 inch sub cards. The kid behind the conter, probably my age, asks me what I want. I say "I'll take a 6 inch meatball sub on wheat." He proceeds to say "Yuck, I hate meatball subs, they're so disgusting. I don't see how anyone can eat them."  Hmmm....  -alex
