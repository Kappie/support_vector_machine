Erm, in other news, family is in "vacation" mode now.  All but me of course, I'm taking psychology in my I.S. class right now.  Maybe I can finally figure out what the fuck is wrong with everyone. =P  But yeah, really, nothing going on.  More crap being dished out about how unsafe rides are, and stupidity reigns.  I'm waiting till the day we have to walk around with giant helmets on.  I will then rip out my heart, and eat it.  And yes, you heard me.  Not renewing my pass to Knott's.  Not worth it.  The only good thing about Knott's is Halloween Haunt.  Don't need a year round pass for that.  Just hop in during October.  Plus I still have my Disneyland Resort pass.  Disney is about oh, four billion times better than Knott's now anyway.  So I'm shifting over to Disneyland.  Not only do they have better rides, their arcades are in better condition also.  Which is always a plus.  And from what I hear.  Xcelerator will receive a MAJOR modification to the ride vehicles.  I'm roughly guessing 4-Point restraints, but I'm not too sure.  Either way, it looks like this Tuesday will be my last "annual pass" visit there.  I'm tired of their shitty Guest Relations, and I'm tired of their BS, bad planning, and other mis-haps that happen.  Hell, I'm not even sure I'm going to Solace this next year.  And if I do, its going to cost me $40 instead of $20.  Oh well.  And as I said before, I really only go during Halloween Haunt.  Yes, I do go other times, but I'm not half as interested in whats going on then.  I slink around and do nothing.  Thats why I'm ditching the pass.  Hopefully my renewal money can be put towards something a bit better than that crap.  I've also blow out 4 BIOS chips today.  Bye computer parts. =)  Haha.  Well, thats about it for now.  Bye Knott's, you were a decent park, but now you just suck.
