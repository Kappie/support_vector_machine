Since my hands are thin, maybe I was born with female hands? o.O  Iona has finally forgived me. Arigato gozaimazu, Iona-chan. I wished that what I did would not harm our friendship :)  As to anything exciting that happened today, I played Silent Hill (the first game, on the PlayStation). I managed to finish the school (darn ugly children monsters, take these silver bullets of death!). The first boss is a gigantic lizard type of monster. Its mouth is opened horizontally. I was shooting at it with my handgun, waiting for it to open its mouth. When it stopped chasing me, I knew it was going to open its mouth and I took out my good ol' shotgun. I stood at a corner and waited. Big mistake. It suddenly lunged at me with its mouth wide open and I was BETWEEN those open mouths and I let go two shots. It fell down dead and I gave a sigh of relief.  As for my RO life, something funny happened yesterday. I was leveling with DingDing (he's a Merchant, I'm an Aco) at Geffen Tower and he was just about to attack an Elder Willow when my Musicmatch Jukebox plays Neod√§mmerung, the final fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith in The Matrix Revolutions. I LMAOed at that time because it was so funny, seeing a puny merchant (sorry Ding!) fighting a tree with that music on.  As to who I really am, I was born Eugene Chan Zhi Xin (stupid name given by my parents) on 15th February 1990 (a day after Valentine's) at Cheras, Kuala Lumpur. Clem (my bro) was born on 15th February 1988. So, our birthdays are on the same day and month (except year). I studied at Tadika Mickey there, then moved to Subang Jaya when I was 6. I then continued my childish education at Tadika Brainchild. When I was 7, I studied at SK Seafield for a year before moving to SK Seafield 3 (which is nearer to my house). I passed the PTS (Penilaian Tahap Satu) and skipped Std 4 to study in Std 5. I'm in Form 3 right now (darn PMR) and my new school is SMK USJ 8. Probably the best schools I ever enroled in compared to the previous ones.  Why do I feel like all my sentences are comprised of the same old boring words?
