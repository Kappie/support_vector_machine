It's not so much the liquidity of the milk or the bisected multilayered nature of the cookies so much as it's the Zen State of Milk and Cookies. I mean, there's this  mindset  you get in when you prepare to consume milk and cookies:  My Cookie Sits there along with milk I'll eat it A state of zen bliss  The cookies and milk hearkens back to my childhood when the cookies and milk were not provided by me, let alone consumed willy nilly at any random point. The communal wafer and beverage was laid out by the most Dietic figure in my life for reasons dictated at which point I partook in the ritual consumption of the offerings. When I sit down to milk and cookies now I think back to my childhood and give thanks for the opportunities that I had to eat them. I also wonder why my mom was such a stingy bitch with the milk, it's not like the fucking cow was going to run dry.
