This one is one of those movies; the ones that simply put a wide smile on you face hours after you’re done with it. You know those? Of course you do.  The plot is fairly simple and predicted – an obsessive psychotic gets way too attached to his doctor and his family. Sounds a lot like “Analyze This”? Its not. As in “Analyze This” the main attraction was the rather squishy mafia’s boss gone nuts, this is not case with this film. Yes, Bill Murray does play an interesting character. And some of the jokes are indeed made on his expense. But the real attraction of this film is the patient- doctor relationship and all the twist that accurse along the film to this relationship. Its all quite predictable but still fun as hell. The movie also manages to avoid any unneeded sentimentality. It’s a pure comedy, and it knows it.  Anyhow, even if you don’t like comedies as much you should watch it for Bill Murray. I know you’re a fan (aren’t we all?).   http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/  And now over to politics. WOW, those few days were so intense. For all of you who doesn’t follow the news: Sharon wanted to pass a bill that states that Israel will withdraw from Gaza until 2005. Now, in Israel, in order to pass a bill one must first pass it at the government table (which all the ministers sit around it). a day before the vote, less then 50% supported the bill. Even some ministers from the Likood, which is Sharon’s party, did not support the bill. To make a long story short – he managed to pass the bill but only after firing 2 ministers. As a result, he lost the support of 3 parliament members (the party, from which those ministers came, had 3 seats, out of 120). And just yesterday, another party, which counts 6 seats, declared that it also resigns from the government and would now oppose Sharon. So, if you do some math that means that shorn now lost his majority in the Parliament. (61 oppose him, 59 favors him). In Israel, that could mean impeachment. Now, it all sounds perfectly fine, and truly democratic does it not? But in fact, that bill, which Sharon had to work so hard to pass, has enormous support with the public. According to the latest pools, more then 70% of the people support. Most of us are sick and tired of wars. This bill is the first real hope of some sort of peace, even if one sided.  You just think about it and tell me if it feels right for you, that a small bunch of less then 300,000 people almost dictate the policy of over 6,000,000 people.
