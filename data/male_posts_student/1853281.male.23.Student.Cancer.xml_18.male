Saturday: studied at bobs, lunch at quangs, walk to the library, than a weird fit of crying at home, followed by homework and housework. Sunday. Homework and housework, the leaning tower, Bob's, long long conversation about life, death, depression and me with a friend. One of those conversations that really lift a burden off your shoulders. enjoyed the weather no end. cheers
