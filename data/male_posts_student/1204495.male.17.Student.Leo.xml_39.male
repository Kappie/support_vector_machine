I'd only been on for about 10mins... They've gone out now though =D Heehee... checking up on the message boards etc.. wow, scary pictures of me from Claire H =| Rowan wants me to send them to him... I think not! It's from our last day when we were leaving, I just have a big grin on my face... and stoopid faces on the others... we...uhm... thought it would be funny. =D *grins* I'm so happy today.. sorry if I haven't been replying to your texts.. I turn my fone on and off all day. My credits going down... VERY fast. lol. It's so hard to text, coz I talk too much! =|
