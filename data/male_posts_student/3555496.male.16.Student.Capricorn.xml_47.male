Operator: "Get those mp3s out of there before it's too late!!     Me: "Uhhh, what?"     Operator: "Get those files to the safehouse immediately!!"     [Click]      at that point i'm like wtf?! and when i notice the straps on my body connected to a backpack i didn't even know was there, i'm like wtf?! and when i open the backpack and see actual mp3 files...i'm like WTF?!      now this backpack seems familiar to me.  very  familiar. wow it's the backpack that was like stolen from me in the sixth grade at soho intermediate!! man that was a cool backpack.      so these punks come from out of nowhere and they're like  "Give me your backpack or we'll kick your ass!"  so then i just start running cus...let's face it, i'm a lover, not a fighter. and eventually they catch up to me and we end up under some bleachers...don't ask...and it's like showtime.      at that point i figure if i can carry a fucking computer file in my backpack, i better be able to do some kickass kung fu. and what do you know i'm kicking ass left and right for like 10 minutes. i mean it was so cool it's indescribable. i wish i could've taped it or something...      anyway after i a while i start running again and i see this giant bush/shrub thingy so i run into it and climb like hella fast over the entrance. and i wait. and wait. finally one of the dudes comes in and i'm like BAMA! so he's dead and this continues until they're all dead and i finally walk out of the mysterious bush.      so i'm walking and i'm walking and i finally get to this farm/ranch thing and i chill out there along the fence. and up comes this girl i knew a long time ago and even though she's not hot in real life she was pretty damn hot in my dream. what can i say, my dreams rule. anyway she's all hot and stuff and you know me with my lack of self esteem...  yeah and then those damn dogs wake my ass up cus they started barking at like 5am. stupid dogs. and you know how you can't exactly pick up where you left off in a dream, so i was pretty much SOL.  damn dirty dogs.
