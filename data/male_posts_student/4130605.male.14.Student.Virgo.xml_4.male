I got up to the bread took the grape juice (wine), and sat down. That's when I realized Jesus chose the most boring things for his body and blood. I mean bread and wine? I've got to give him credit for the fact that he chose an alcoholic beverage, but wine? If I were Jesus (God save us!), I would have chosen something people enjoy eating. Like popcorn. Popcorn and Rootbeer. That's the stuff. This is my body w/ extra butter for you. And take this non-caffeinated rootbeer for my blood. Jesus could have done better (praying lightning doesn't strike me). I think this whole "not trying" thing runs in his family, though. I mean God built the world in 6 days and took a breather on the 7th. I mean thats a whole week! That's a long time for anything! The U.S. Postal service is faster than that. Well, now that I am going to hell for Blasphemy, have a great day. Note: this is probably the most religious I will get.
