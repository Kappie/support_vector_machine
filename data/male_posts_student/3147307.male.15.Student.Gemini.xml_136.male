Let's see, I got an air pump, tire levers, tube repair kit, leather cycling gloves, a seat bag, and cycling shorts. Today, a group of us are going on a 40 (38.9 to be exact) mile bike ride down to CG. I have it all planned out. But first today, I have drivers ed. ugh! I have to drive today, too - that starts in about 50 minutes. There was a great top 10 list on Letterman last night (warning: some are kinda crude): Top 10 ways to improve the baseball all-star game. 10. Replace "take me out to the ballgame" with 50 cent's "what up gangsta" 9. Just a thought, but when Saddam's soccer team lost, he'd execute 'em 8. Two words: monkey umpires 7. Losing players spend remainder of the year making seven bucks an hour 6. Nine starters, eight uniforms 5. Seventh inning players' wife-swap 4. One lucky ticket-holder gets to manage the Expos in 2005 3. Between innings, Pete Rose plays keno 2. Allow top hitters to use performance-enhancing supplements...oh wait, they already do that 1. Losing pitcher has to give rubdown to bud selig (baseball commisioner)
