I can't even hang with my best friend because i work so much, and now some emotionally unstabled ass walked into my life. Apparantly he is a wreck and he deserves it for making other people feel bad for him, molesting me, and being antisocial.  Argh I hate my life, why the fuck cant i just get out of this house  one day a week  for reasons other thant work?!?  Bean, call me tomorrow, i forgot to talk to you about something. I'll be home after 5.
