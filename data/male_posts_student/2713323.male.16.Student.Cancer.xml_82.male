O wait, where was something...uh...like, no, nothing...i thought something wasnt right, but i didnt suspect neething nonetheless. Later i called out to her, tapped on her chair a few times, no reaction, she didnt even budge, let alone answer. So i thought to myself ok, shes pissed. At what? I spent the rest of the day thinking, till it came to the last 2 periods, i tried to talk to her again, and there was a reply, maybe a small conversation, with bored replys, and the thing was when she talked to jonathan, she immediately laughed and seem very cheerful...ok, shes pissed. At what? i have done something that hurt her without knowing it, or even i know it, i forgot maybe? I tried to make it up, to have a clearer view of everything, to actually know whats going on, so i asked her whether she was free after school to stay back to chat, i got a "hmm maybe" so i thought, ok, at least i will get to know whats happening. At the dismisal bell, i packed my stuff and sat at my seat, waiting...and i saw her pack and leave, walking out of the class just like that, and she didnt even glance over...ok, i must have done something really bad, because we have never been on ends with each other for so long. I got a little agitated and very disturbed so i sent her an sms, "I guess you're still angry and you don't want to solve it."...no reply. This is what i inferred from her blog.  "yester nite started off wif pb...i wasnt angry juz feel that wat for u give in 2 me...ya u explain 2 me,i accepted it n understand but then i found out someth else...i wun be bother 2 tell u or wat,cuz i feel that u shld actually noe it lorx.....i m this kind,u can say i dun want solve it...then let it be la... "   Ok, i understand why u cant be bothered to tell me, because if someone does something wrong, he should be able to realise what he has done wrongly right? I guess its really my fault now, cos i have no clue of what i did. But i must have done something wrong. So please, if you have heart for forgiveness, i'm asking it from you dearly, please, enlighten me and show my flaws. For i'm lost. If you are reading this, if under that anger you could just squeeze a little bit of symphathy, please feel free to express yourself by smsing or calling me. I don't mind if its harsh, just so that i can at least hear from you, is what keeps me going on every, single, day. Because, i love you, even more today that yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow.
