Nothing really important has happened to me, so I couldn't really find anything important to say. While it has been hot the past few days (see: "This Heat is Making Me... below for confirmation). I've been sleeping in the living room, where it's nice and cool.   Really, nothing very interesting has happened to me. I've been to the various Vancouver summer events (i.e. Chinatown and Richmondâ€™s Nightmarket, the P.N.E.) which where repeats of previous years (boring).   I'm really mad at myself for not doing much with my comic in the last two weeks, but I rarely find the time to get it done. I've been working on two mini projects and I've pushed Him, Her, Them into a hiatus. I'm trying hard to get sketches in when I have free time, but I don't get much time to scan, color and word the pages.   Anyways, I'm off to watch some anime with a friend (I'm a dork). I'll be trying to post more often.     currently listening to:  kool and the gang - summer madness
