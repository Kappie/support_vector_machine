SOOOOOOO true.  I could name specific incidents, and specific people, but it happens so much around me, that it's almost pointless.  Usually the jokes are all the same, "      nigger  " and I really can't laugh.  I just feel awkward, because this is always in a group of white people.  It bothers me more when I think of how much people must say 'nigger' when I'm not around... But that isn't the point.  The point is that it's one of the few words in English that will make me cringe.... Actually that's not fair.  At my lunch table, Greg get's mad at people (Craig) for saying it, but that's about it.  And when Craig, who is black says it, much of the sting is lost.  It just sound ignorant when he says it, but when I hear it in a joke.... Wow, I can't express how it makes me feel.  It's not sad, and it's not angry.  It's sort of like, I should do something, but I really don't want to go off on my friends an alienate myself.  Thus starts the memetic pollution!  I guess that was what was on my mind.  I have hella-work for next week, and I can't focus.
