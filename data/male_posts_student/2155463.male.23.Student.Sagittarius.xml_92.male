Yeah, if I EVER see another Avery label it will be TOO SOON; by my count I put on over 1500 labels today (and my fingers are raw).  But I've been told that there's going to be a rush proposal they want me to work on tomorrow morning, so that should be fun :)  I also got in my Swedes today.  For all of you non-competitive swimmers, Swedes (i.e. Swedish goggles) are goggles without any foam, plastic, rubber, etc. around the eyepieces; they're about as basic as you can get.  I loved them when I used to swim competitively, and now I remember why - they are SO MUCH FUN.  I guess you'd have to plug into the "swimming culture" to really get it, but the gyst of it is that you can flip them at people easily (always a plus - almost as good as having a towel that snaps really well ;), the extra strap is great for chewing on, and you can adjust them so that they fit your face perfectly by replacing the string nosepiece they give you with a rubber one off the strap on the back.  And they're CHEAP (one pair was $3.95).  Oh, and I get great visibility out of them... (Yes, I CAN get excited over seemingly nothing...)
