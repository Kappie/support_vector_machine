Today, I can finally rest at home and complete my To-Do list.  First thing. I have to spring clean my table (okay. winter-clean would be more apporpriate. Spring hasn't come yet, and it's winter now). Yeah. You can't believe how much junk I removed from my table. I kept working pens, ornaments (presents), stationery and letters from friends (I collected so many over the years. Like letters from Joanne Ye, YingYing, SL and Wendy). Ohters like useless things with I haven't touched for years and is gathering dust is thrown away. After that, I gave my table a good wipe and re-arranged my stuff. It looks much more better now! So neat and organized.  I also spent today watching my taped programs. Oh god! Rupert got kicked out. WQ is gonna be so dead!!! SPOILERS DO NOT DESERVE TO WALK THIS PLANET! Idiots (the ones who kicked Rupert out, with the exception of Lil, and spoilers and wanna-be spoilers)! So meowful! X-Men Revolution is so suspenseful! Apocalypse is now releashed! What is gonna happen?!  Hm. One interesting thing happened. Me and WQ got into an argument, about the 'lousiness' of Escape Theme Park. He asked me to present my points why I think Escape is not sucky. So I did (I am not gonna present them here. I found it tiring narrating the same thing over and over again.). He tried to counter my argument, but his counter has a lopphole, so I countered his counter and won. However, knowing WQ, he's not gonna let it slide easily. The sore loser went to a local message board and asked for people's opinions on Escape. He's proving to me that Escape is sucky. I laugh at his futile attempts to 'win'. Oh come on! This is a really stupid way to win. I wrote a message, listing my previous arguements and counter-arguements. Heh. Let's see who's gonna have the final laugh. This should be interesting.   Hmm....I made further additions and subtractions to my To-Do list. Here are the changes:  Things to do:  -Winter clean my entire room. Slowly. -Print out my blog entires.  -Decide on who to buy Xmas presents and what to give them   Okay. That's all I think. Gotta go now. Tomorrow's going to Escape. Very excited about it. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
