    
       well well well, after such a long period of procrastination, this blog has finally materialised. Not to mention, couple of friends'(you know who ;)) perpetual prompts have made me get this blog rollin'. Anyway, I'm still in the midst of seeking some help to make the blog look more presentable, so just bear with this in the meantime. By the way, just a little note to end this exceedingly short first entry, any comments or rantings that are made are purely an avenue for me to express my personal distress over a certain preoccupation, and I don't mean to demean anyone in the process. That's what a blog's supposed to be for in the first place, isn't it?  ciao.  P.S this will be probably the first and last time such a formal entry will be showcased on this url. =)
