As we all know, the word occurs in the song at the beginning of the second verse where the lead singer (blonde guy with the very nice hair, though I must admit, I prefer the bassist's hair.) sings, "Welcome to the fallout, welcome to existence...Et cetera."    Below is the dictionary definition:     fallout n.   1.  The slow descent of minute particles of debris in the atmosphere following an explosion, especially the descent of radioactive debris after a nuclear explosion.    Jiggawats?  I don't know about y'all, but I had to read that a few times before I understood what was going on. Mildly understood. I really don't understand.  I couldn't explain it to you that is (that means don't ask.)  So what is Switchfoot trying to say here?  Is it the apocalypse brought upon my nuclear war?  Switchfoot has Christian themed music (Joc saw them at Creation.) so maybe this has a deeper meaning?  Did the Straylight Run have to look up what fallout meant too, and then named their song "slow descent" because of the definition?  All I know is that I was being mislead as to what "fallout" meant....and they told us to use context clues in school...psh...
