Oh, and while at camp, I accumulated many nicknames: Backback Splash Creekface Frosted Miniwheats It from the Pit Swamp Thing and thats about it. I also met some REALLY awesome people, like Zach aka California, Jeff, Laura, and Betsy. I also met some ok people like Paul, Dave, Scott, and Liza. Well, thats all for now!  later, bradleyJ
