I had to say goodbye to Nai, Julia, Janet, and the hobbits from LOTR.  Then somehow I ended up in Cambridge. Dr. Dawson had recruited UCSS 2001 for a secret mission of some sort. I spent most of the time doing a lot of fucking running. Then I was trying to find the girls in the Fish and Chips place of doom.   There was some seriously fucked up shit going on in my head last night. That late night Jeno's pizza probably had something to do with it.  ***
