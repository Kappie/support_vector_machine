In any manner, I suffer withdrawal symptoms.   Now for the Rochester-Brockport Crime Bulletin  Cindy Vaca, a student at the University of Rochester admittedly ate the loaves of bread belonging to Luke Fischer, an employee and alumni of the same school. Vaca is under dorm-arrest pending trial.   Luke arrived at his apartment only to find his delicious loaves of bread completely douched. Gone. I apologized. For some reason I believed he had given them to me. I am in remorse. Luke, I totally douched your bread and I'm sorry. I'm a bread doucher. Oh, and there were FIVE loaves, and they were delicious. Oops.   CinnyDearest:  it's over! i'm breaking up with you  luke awol:  food divorce  CinnyDearest:  it's not you. it's me  luke awol:  from your food husband  CinnyDearest:  i'm divorcing you  CinnyDearest:  me and my fat  luke awol:  shut up! (that lawyer looks great on you)  I love my job. I get paid to do mostly nothing. My only beef is that I am not allowed to do that "nothing" in my room. I am forced to do my nothings in a mechanic's workshop, sitting in a hard chair, wearing clothing. (And you know how I hate to wear clothing.) The real physical labor of the day never begins before 8:30am. However, my boss (a.k.a. my favorite redneck) insists I show up to "work" at 7am so we can have an early start to our group nap and crossword puzzle. I compromise and show up at 7:30am. I guess if Tom fires me, he can stare at Dave Wingrove's legs and Jamil's chest all day.   I guess I shouldn't complain about my job. My job description is "assisting" my boss, Tom. I do, technically, assist him with the crossword puzzle and, occasionally, the jumble.  Inspired by the lovely phone conversation Ben and I had last night, I wrote him a letter to accompany the stack of photographs I'm sending to him in Massachusetts. I made myself a Shirley Temple with the grenadine he gave me and I consumed a Hershey's Cookies  Cream Bar. Feeling rather complacent, I reminded myself to appreciate the small things in life.  Speaking of small things, someone got rid of a perfectly good baby and tossed it in a dumpster in Irondequoit. I can only imagine how horrified Laura must feel right now. She lives at the apartment complex where the infant was found. She  likes babies a lot and doesn't like it when someone tosses them in dumpsters.  In my two-person computer class, I came across a picture of my friend David in my online photo album. He ran the Los Angeles Marathon this year and I was very proud of him.    urlLink    David running the LA Marathon urlLink     David and I met each other in debate camp in 1995. (He's the debate nerd; I'm just a debate  loser .) My best friend Kim - who also attended the camp - coincidentally transferred to his high school shortly after the camp ended. They had a two-year relationship, and naturally, David and I became friends.   In Los Angeles, I was addicted to his company and we socialized almost everyday. No film went unwatched. No late night diner went unpatroned. I have always been able to rely on David to listen to my crap. "In due time" he responds. Which actually means "stop complaining, you whiny twit." But I appreciate the sympathy. David saves me when I don't have money, or a ride, or company. He always has good advice when it comes to school, job, and life. He loves eating foods from all over the world and never ever complains about driving long distances. A part of me wishes that my situation doesn't work out and I would be forced to return to LA so I can live with my friend again. David Tom - my consolation prize.  IN DUE TIME, everyday, all of my heroes will have their tributary paragraphs as this online log is a record of my day, and my days are not possible without all the people who save me without expectations or reservations.
