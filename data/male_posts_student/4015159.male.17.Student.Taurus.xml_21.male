Anyway it started with flooding in cleethorpes, the place we'd planned to go for the day, so after changing our minds we decided to go to Meadowhall instead and see a movie.           The Movie... 13 going on 30. Not a bad movie to be honest, Jennifer Garner playing a pretty convincing 13 year old in a 30 year olds body. The best part of the movie had to be when at a party Thriller came on and everyone did the dance, it was PRO!          After the movie we did a bit of shopping, had some dinner and finally went to sit in our favourite place (the seating above the Oasis). We were sat there for a while but no one was up there and there were a lot of empty seats downstairs. We were just talking and reading some magazines, myself and becky decided to go and play the 2p machines in the arcade.           When we got back, the second we sat down a Security Guard came up to us. Being power crazy from the black tie he wore, and the clear earpiece, he began to get clever and said something along the lines of "Move or Get Out." I'm sorry fuck face, I don't see any "No loitering," signs. Well I should've said that but we were all a bit shocked of being told to move along.           There were only 4 of us and we weren't being loud or anything so there was no reason at all to move us. So, WE COMPLAINED! We wrote an official complaint and handed it in, I received a reply this morning saying that when loitering isn't allowed but the security should be more polite. So why don't they tell that 80 year old woman who's been sat in the same place for 10 hours to move? PREJUDIST! That's why.           Being 17 year old teenagers we fall into a stereotype in which we are trouble causers etc etc. When 80% of us aren't. Any hoot I can't think of any tasks lately, that's why I haven't been posting as much.           TTFN ppl!
