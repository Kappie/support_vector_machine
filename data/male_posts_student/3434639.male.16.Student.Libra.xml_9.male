It make my eyes sore just by looking at the chat window.       For example "what" and "wurt". Now tell me what in the mighty and magnificent world is classy about that. First of all wurt sounds nothing like what, so it make it look as if you are using a whole different word with a whole different meaning. Secondly, "what" and "wurt" both have the same amount of letters. So why is it so hard to type "what". Even the positioning of the letters on the keyboard makes it easier to type "what" if compared to "wurt"!!       Next example. "Was" and "wuz". They may sound the same and they still have the same amount of letters but like i said earlier why is it so hard to type "was" then. Secondly if you would care to take a look on the keyboard you will notice that the word "was" comprimises of the letters "w", "a" and "s" where as the word "wuz" comprimises of the letters "w", "u", and "z". By looking at your keyboard you can see that the three letters that form the word "was" are located so closely together where as it is the other way around for the word "wuz".      I do not understand why people like to do this. Full sentences baffle me because i have to try and pronounce each word to find out what the person is really trying to say.I am not saying you shouldn't use short forms but what i am saying is don't use useless "short forms". Use words which can be easily understood and which can be efficiently typed.
