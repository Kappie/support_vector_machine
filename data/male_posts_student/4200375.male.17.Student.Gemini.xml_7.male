IF someone does read it...don't tell me you did...don't comment on it...etc. It would ruin all point of writing it.  You want a poem where I show you all my fears Analysize it, then decide whether or not I should get praise or cheers Back off...if you honestly think you could do it better, then do it. I'm at the edge of quitting, a hair to saying, "screw it." I hate the time it takes to learn to manipulate my words And to allow alliteration and for whose entertainment?...yours? Poetry and music are my choices of communication I don't give a fuck if it gives you a sensation Or makes you feel that you criticism deserves a standing ovation because the situation I'm facing is causing a sensation of frustration See, I thought the poems I wrote were my internal monolouge Why did you decide to grab the ball and try to ruin them all? Saying, "His style is reminiscent of Nash, Plath, and Poe." Yes, they influenced me, but that's not all I know! I have a brain of my own and I swear that I can use it. To write what I want, where I want , when , and what with. I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I needed your permission Your approval to be creative. So frankly I'm schitzing. There are more voices in my head than any person would want It's getting crowded and I"m trying to kick them out, one by one. What you see in my work and what's there are completly different A difference equal to the distance from here to the next solar system. So stop.
