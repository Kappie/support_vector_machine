I am officially 17 years of old... lol... and it feels pretty good. I had a party at my house with just family and a couple close friends. My two best friends Vernon and Steve (aka Mark) and my girlfriend Brittany and our good friend Britney were all invited. Only "Mark" and Brittany could make it. It was fun. There are lots of pictures Mark took. Most are of Brittany and I, and a little of Mark. Maybe I'll try to find a way to link to some. Anyway, comment on these two things: NFL championships this year: Who's your pick? Also, MLB champs next year, tell us who and why. See you everyday from now on!
