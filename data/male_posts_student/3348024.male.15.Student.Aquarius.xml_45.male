General Frye and I were walking to school and I was sort of out of it and nearly walked in front of a car so General Frye yelled, "Commander Brad, Stop!."  Then exactly 3.1415926535897932 seconds later a car drove by...  He saved my life by not letting me get hit by a car....  I think the government should give him a badge of bravery or something...
