Here's why: instead of trying to compete with the big network companies, they've decided to start their best programs' seasons in the summer, and get basically no competition with anyone. Which got me to thinking, why is the summer hiatus a standard? Why do all the networks stop showing new (and good, that's the point) in May? Do people stop watching TV in the summer? I think not.   Flawed logic, if standard, reigns supreme.
