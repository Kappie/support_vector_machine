"Look deep within that place we call a heart, a place where love is stored, tell them what you feel before the time is too late"  The true beauty of life itself was rather simple when all i really need to do now is proclaim my never ending love.....  "Before you tell the one ou love them, consider this....."  The wise old man said to me  "Will it effect your friendship? for realtionships are based on more than a friendship. If the one you lvoe is right for you, you will know about it, you will have a love so strong that only god himself can break it. so bear this in mind next time..... Love is never ending but life itself is!"
