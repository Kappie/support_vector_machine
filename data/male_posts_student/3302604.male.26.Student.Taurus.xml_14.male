Whilst on holiday in Oil Country, this president, this most powerful man in the world, this self- style protector of the masses, this man who, with a mere word, can have people disposed of if he wished, managed to fall off a bicycle and narrowly miss a tree. Talk about art imitating life. I was reminded of  urlLink The West Wing  Season 1 Episode 1 and the President crashing into a tree. Back then I thought it unlikely that this would be possible what with all the security and secret service and stuff, but I didn't reckon with the ingenuity of human stupidity. I man, this guy manages to embarras or humiliate himself at every opportunity and doesn't seem to notice. He may not be a decent world leader but he gets my vote for comedy relief every time.  And this is the guy who's supposed to be protecting everybody from all the bad people out there. From what I've seen, this term is defined as everyone I say so, since the Israelis aren;t being the nicest fo people, and yet he refuses to do anything about it (the fact that there are some very useful business deals happening between them has nothing to do with it- I'm assured)  Just thank whoever you believ in that American politicians can only serve for a short time  Jack
