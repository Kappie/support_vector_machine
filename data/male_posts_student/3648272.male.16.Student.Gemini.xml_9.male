But before I give you the answer let me give you my history with dieting/working out.   It all started the summer after 8th grade, I was shorter than 5’ 6”, I think, and I weighed around 175...thats a lot. So I thought it would be healthy to lose some weight, not to mention I’de look like a normal person lol. So I signed up to the gym. I would go once a day, about 3-4 times a week. In each session, I would run on the treadmill for 10 mins, walk for 10 mins, and go on the bike for 10 mins. In addition, I kept a diet that wasn’t strict, just limited myself on certain carbs/sugars. That summer I went down to like 160 IBS.   When school started, I stopped going to the gym but I held my diet fairly well. So I didn’t gain and I didn’t lose anything. The summer after 9th grade, I went back to the gym, with the same gym routine only this time I was stricter with what I ate, eliminating all excess fats, sugars, and carbs. That summer I went down to like 145 IBS.   When school started again, I stopped going to the gym, but still kept the strict diet. In March I went back to the gym. But this time, the routine was a bit different. I would run on the treadmill for 20 mins straight, non stop. Then bike for 10 mins, then weights, then abs. I made my diet even stricter. When June came I weighed around 137 IBS. Summer was on the way and I knew I would have to kick it into gear to lose that little bit of extra weight.   As soon as the SAT II was over, I started a whole new regimen. I would go to the gym everyday, twice a day. Mornings I would do cardiovascular exercise. 30 minutes on the treadmill, with incline. I would run over 3 miles. Then I would do the bike for 10 mins on a high level. At night I would come back, run another mile in 10 mins just for warm-up. Then I would lift weights for about an hour and 15 mins. Then I would finish it off with a mini ab routine. I would do this everyday, except Wednesday where I would only do morning cardio and Thursday when I would go to an aerobics class instead of weights. I follow this regimen to this very day.   Pertaining to food, aside from fruits and veggies, I barely eat any carbs, and when I say BARELY, I mean it. I drink only skim milk. I sometimes eat corn flakes but usually my cereal is a special brand that only has 3 carbs and 17 grams of protein. I eat about one piece of toasted whole wheat bread every 2 days. In a given day I consume around 1000-1200 calories, I burn more than half of that at the gym just doing morning cardio. Now it’s the end of June and I weigh around 130 IBS.  So the question people keep asking me. Why do I do all this? Well first off, let me tell you, I don’t think I’m fat. In my eyes, I’m normal. So you’re probably asking,  if you don’t think you’re fat, why follow such a strict regimen, when you can do half as much and still maintain the same weight?  Well there are a few reasons, but lets start with the obvious one. The number 1 reason is….. Girls. For any ladies reading, let me let you in on a little secret. Guys don’t do things that make them uncomfortable for their own sake. Guys like to keep things as comfortable as possible. They don’t like to waste their time on looking good or wearing nice clothes. Anytime a guy exercises rigorously at the gym, dresses very nice, wears nice cologne, or does anything out of the ordinary he’s doing it to impress some girl or a specific girl, and any guy that disagrees with this or says otherwise is a liar. And that is the COLD HARD TRUTH. So now you understand, I don’t just want to see my abs, I want others to see them. This brings me to my second reason. Doing all of this brings forth a sense of accomplishment, if that makes any sense. After I work my ass off, I feel as though I’ve accomplished something. And why shouldn’t I? I can’t name one single living person  whom I know  that does as much or nearly as much as I do.   Another reason I do all of this is to stay healthy believe it or not. My father once told me a story (true story, it was published in a book).  In this story, there was a guy who used to pretty much live a carefree life in terms of nutrition and exercise. He then came in contact with a serious illness. Not sure what the illness was, but this was a long time ago, so medicine and technology wasn’t as advanced as today. The prognosis was bad. The guy was going to die. But by some twist of fate, some miracle, he came out alive. After he was diagnosed, he swore to god that if he would survive he would change his lifestyle around.  And he kept his promise. From that day he would always eat healthy/exercise and all of that mumbo jumbo (he was seventeen at the time). So you’re probably wondering what happened to the guy. He kept a strict regimen his whole life and he died at the age of 84. You’re probably thinking that is not to amazing since you know many people who survive that long now. But I bet you can’t guess how this guy died. He died while surfing. SURFING AT THE AGE of 84! How many 84 year-olds do you know go surfing? Probably none. When they did an autopsy and cut the poor bastard open, the doctors couldn’t believe it. This guy’s blood/organs or w/e were so clean and in such good condition that he actually had the body of a 20 year-old! In our society today, no one is like that. We have contaminated ourselves with fast food, and pretty much everything else. Now, even with top-of-the-line medicine/technology, the average American does not live past 80. And even then we usually sit in wheel chairs or have various health problems. This guy was completely healthy.   This guy is almost like a role-model to me. I would much rather be healthy and active in 60 or 70 years than suffer from various health problems. I know a lot of people probably feel hatred towards those who were blessed with super metabolisms and don’t gain anything from what they eat, despite what they eat. You might see some of these people consume the unhealthiest foods and still remain in good shape. I bet you probably hate then. Well don’t bother. What these people fail to realize is that their super metabolisms don’t last forever. With every passing decade, your metabolic rate decreases by 10%. That’s 1% a year for those who are mathematically challenged.  Which means, that there super metabolisms won’t last forever, but there unhealthy habits will last a very long time because it’s already programmed into their minds in a subconscious level. Why do you think so many fat 40 year-old Americans try all diets and fail? It’s because they have been eating poorly there whole lives and these habits have been engraved into their mind at the subconscious level, so despite their most sincere efforts they will always set themselves up to fail in the long run. I would also like to mention that those with super metabolisms may not be gaining weight in there early years, but they are damaging all of their bodily organs and blood, not to mention overall health. I’m sure some of these people suffer from cholesterol problems and other medical issues. The fact is that nature did not design the human body to consume more than half the foods you see in an ordinary super market. All though these people may be eating whatever they want and not gaining anything, they are damaging their body and after they hit 30 they will feel the effects of their bad decisions. By eating any snack that you see in a store, like fruit rollup for example, what are you actually doing? In essence you are putting chemicals into your body, chemicals that were not meant to ever be digested, by our bodies. These chemicals do damage over time, and we only feel the affects after a certain number of years.   So to sum it all up. Why do I do what I do?  1. Girls 2. Gives me a sense of accomplishment 3. To stay healthy  WOW that was really long. Feel free to leave any comments, but don’t bother bashing this post. Nothing ANYONE can say will change my regimen. With every passing day, what I do becomes easier and more natural. Sometimes when I look at pizza I don’t even want to eat it anymore knowing that it’s just no good. So that’s it for this long passage.
