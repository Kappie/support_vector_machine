I found myself sleeping very badly and waking up very early today...probabely only 4 hours of sleep...-_-...so very tired...my body is aching all over the place...ouch!                 But even with all my limitations, I still    manage to get alot of work done today...I finally decided to take up my Volunteering work today and start doing some...I was told if you do more voluteering work, you will better your chance in getting into a university...who knows? Maybe their right...           Anyways...I discovered some major flaws in my handbook today and took me 5 hours+ to fix it...turns out all my page size was not correct and was not ready for printing, and since many pages of my handbook had ridiculously complex format, when the page size was changed...well...everything just want......I'll let you imagine the rest...           But all in all I was able to fix it...but what do I get other than a very tired body & mind?...even more problem, now because of the new page size, I have doubled the number of pages I orginally had which present a problem because I don't have as many background images...and my time is running out for more real life photography...so let's see if Google can help me out on this one. Still no cover though, my pastors want to see a full hand book this coming Sunday, I don't know where I can dig up a cover...oh well...I'll do the best I can...but time is against me...it was always against me.           But...overall it have been a ok day, I'm sure to get a good night sleep after all this...after all...I'm still just a kid. :) ...well...at least boredom haven't kicked in yet...(this is about the only summer that I'm not bored) but I have a feeling I soon will be...           Later Days           "Since the beginning of time, time were against us, and always will be"           Neo...
