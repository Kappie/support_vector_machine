I got a 2 on the brass choir, tho it shoulda been a 1, some of the judges used the state grading scale, which is harder.  I mean hey at least you could give better comments if your gunna give us a 2!  jeez raise your music stands? come on.  and probably a 2 on T-Bone party, i think he judged it the same way, but nevertheless the 4ths and 1sts sucked anyway... lol yes I'm the greatest... lol  what else... you'd be surprised at how comfortable bleachers are when you lay down. yeah i got bored waiting for the LATE horns....  Oo and reid made me decide i'm going to toy with the artificial language thing again, this time there being a rule that you can teach it to anyone so long as they're a guy (hence the guy language) so sorry ladies but you'll have to just be content with what we decide to say in english... lol  I finally figured out my signature.  It was inspired a little bit by the tolkien logo, i was cleaning up my room (we have company next weekend) and came across the hobbit and saw it and then thought about the rambaldhi symbol again (it looks like this:  O ) and started to draw (and i'm not telling the exact details of how i came up with it :P ) and came up with it and its pretty much imposible to do justice to it with words, but its sortof like an horizontally elongated 8 with a divisor in the middle and the bottom left intersection rounded, as well as a line coming from the vertex of the left segments of the 8, curving downward, then upward and eventually to a dot.  Another dot is just to the right of the vertex of the right segments of the 8 and another above the divisor.  Phew!  You probably have no idea what that looks like, in part because i can't describe it all that well, if you really want to know what it looks like have me draw it, or perhaps i'll scan it sometime
