Debate the issue.  The leader chooses one side (centralized vs. decentralized) and selects one of the group members to argue the point. The leader assigns the other two members to argue the opposing view point.   Arguing for a centralization:  Carl Wallentin Stephanie Tancayo   Arguing for a decentralization:  Bernhard Lehner Pisith Kulkanchanachewin  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Introducing the terms centralization / decentralization   According to Wall (n.d.), information systems (IS) are major part of today’s businesses. Currently, though, it is becoming a controversy whether IS should be centralized or decentralized. Generally, IS can be centralized, decentralized, partly centralized, and partly decentralized. Wall stated that decentralized systems provide flexibility, independence, empowerment, and service orientation to individual business units or departments. On the other hand, centralized systems allow an organization to allocate all of its IT resources to one particular business department, for example the IS department that provides IT services to the whole company. This approach brings about control, efficiency, and cost reductions  *********************  Argumentation in support of centralization   After a decentralization trend of ISs in the 1980s and 1990s, more and more companies are now moving towards recentralization of the IT recourses. No longer are IT operations merely a solver of efficiency problems and other unit crisis at factory floors, call centers, and other parts of a business. Now, as expressed by Stephanie Stahl (2004), “cost cutting, intense ROI demands, … and other factors are driving a new level of automation and efficiency within the core IT department.” While the decentralization increased local sensitivity, as argued before, costs and control bolted away. Therefore, to gain improved control over resources and budget, “these departments are [now expected to] incorporate the constant improvement and process optimization in their own operations”.  According to Darrell Dunn (2004), more than three out of four managers consider obtaining better return on IT investment a top priority for their companies. Taking that objective into account, automating more ISs, thereby “boosting utilization rates, cutting costs, reducing downtime, [and] speeding up application … deployments”, saves both valuable time and money. Another advantage by centralizing systems is that companies can more swiftly spot trends. Dunn describes, for example, how consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co. uses a centralized program to monitor activities in its more than 600 stores. With help of the program, Best Buy can quickly recognize recurring problem and swiftly assess whether it is global in nature or limited to one store or one region. This has, additionally, reduced help-desk volume, thereby saving both money and increasing customer satisfaction.  *********************  Argumentation in support of decentralization   Contrary to what was stated in the last argumentation, a recent study presented by Kahai (2003) shows that 46% of all participants would describe their IS in the past as highly centralized. However, only 27% still say that it is highly centralized in their current configuration, and a prediction for the future resulted in only 16% highly centralized systems. Kahai discusses the problems associated with this trend of decentralization, such as difficulties with maintenance of the IS. Despite this disadvantage, the article comes to the conclusion that the decentralization trend will hold in the future. Two reasons exemplified was: (1) Employees computer skills will increase further, thereby requiring less centralization. (2) Technological developments will benefit decentralization, as PCs get more and more powerful, they are able to perform processes, which in the past only where abled by centralized “super computers”. Much more than that, todays business environment is changing faster than ever before, and with out decentralization, companies are just not as efficient in adapting to the changes at different places and times. The article, however, states that some centralization will be necessary in the future, to provide some of the advantages such as easy adaptation of new software and limited management control.  *********************  Argumentation in support of centralization   The trend in business today is, no, not decentralization, but for companies, as mentioned earlier, to push to recentralize their IT operations in order to reduce costs and achieve better economies of scale on technology purchases. As explained by Hoffman, recentralization can be counted on to yeild savings on “infrastructure and other IT services that are driven by a large level of fixed costs.” For example, companies that consolidate their data centers generally see a cost reduction of 10% to 15% in that area. Nevertheless, a major stumbling block to recentralization is to effectively communicating the rationale for the process to all IT staffers and business users. Many may feel threatened by the new structure because they may feel as though they are losing control of their operations. However, if these users are properly informed, educated, and involved in the process, the transition can be a much smoother one. Organizational change is nearly always a difficult and threatening process. Therefore, it is importnant to help end users understand the value of IT and a centralized IS.  The most common approach to business intelligence, according to Whiting, is to assemble a team of developers to build a data warehouse or data mart for a specific project, buy a reporting tool to use with it, an disassemble the team upon the project’s completion. This however is like “reinventing the wheel,” and such implementations can result in high development and support costs and incompatible buisness-intelligence systems throughout a company. Some companies are, consequently, taking a more strategic aproach: standardizing on fewer business-intelligence tools and making them available throughout their organizations even before projects are planned. To execute these strategies, companies are creating dedicated groups, sometimes called competency centers or centers of excellence, to manage business-intelligence projects and provide techincal and analytical expertise to other employees. These centers are ususally staffed with people who have a variety of technical, business, and data-analysis expertise, and the centers become a repository of business-intelligence related skills. Again, cost reduction is often the driving factor for companies to create these centralized competancy centers to consolidate business-intelligence systems. Chris Amos, a reporting solutions manager at British Telecom, says that standard technology and implementation practices can reduce the cost of some business-intelligence projects by up to 95%.  *********************  Argumentation in support of decentralization   There are many advantages of decentralized IS. First of all, a decentralized system provide a company organizational responsiveness. Second, the startup costs for decentralized IS are relatively low. Third, an organization can tailor and scale the system to meet individual needs. Fourth, the most important advantage of a decentralized IS is that it provides organizational flexibility. This stems from the fact that each individual unit control their own IS. As a result, multiple computer systems are involved. If one of its network systems fails, other systems will still be able to run. Lastly, decentralized IS also provide company benefits of increased accountability, motivation, and management responsiveness.  To exemplify some of the disadvantages of decentralized IS it has to be recognized that a decentralized system of course lacks the control provided of a centralized one. This can lead to the second disadvantage, which is duplication of resources. Because of multiple computer systems, the company may have duplicated resources. In addition, decentralized IS can sometimes cost the company more than centralized IS in the long run. In defiance of these disadvantages, a decentralized IS still provide more advantages to organizations. For efficiency, decentralized information systems allow users to directly control there IS budget and their demands. In addition, decentralized systems also reduce costs and risks of a whole system breakdown. Moreover, decentralized IS reduce top-down communication, flatten organization hierarchies, and increase innovatively responsive. In order to achieve this goal, a organization has to break free of any bureaucratic constraints.  *********************  Argumentation in support of centralization   Some will argue that being locally sensitive while running a centralized information system is impossible. They will defend their standpoint with tooth and nail claiming that running the IS decentralized is the only valid option for a large, global company. Contending that view is Kevin Turner, Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Wal-Mart, who in an interview with Abbie Lundberg (2002) talks about how his company copes with global growth in spite of a commitment to run IS centrally. To understand how large Wal-Mart really is, consider these facts: last year the company generated more than $256 billion in global revenue, managed almost 5,000 stores in 10 different countries, obtained the services of approximately 30,000 suppliers, and operated 1 (o n e!) information system. According to Turner, “running centralized IS with homegrown, common-source code gives Wal-Mart a competitive advantage and helps the company maintain one of the lowest expense structures in retail”.  Nevertheless, in the article Turner recognizes the difficulties of balancing the advantages of a centralized system with the disadvantages in local flexibility. Therefore, three fundamental philosophies govern Wal-Mart’s IS strategy. “The first philosophy is to run a centralized information system for … operations all over the world, and … run that from Arkansas. The second is to have common systems and common platforms. The third is to be merchants first and technologists second.” By keeping the processes and systems almost the same no matter of geographic location, Wal-Mart has managed to drive down costs, become exceedingly efficient, and minimize downtime and start-up time during transition of people. Furthermore, to ensure local flexibility, the company has come up with a model of decentralized decisions but centralized systems and controls. This model bestows people in local markets with a great deal of flexibility, so that they can perform their jobs in the best, most effective way.  *********************  Argumentation in support of decentralization   In times like this, where computer crime seems to be a sport and a terrorist attack could happen every day, a decentralized information system might be the best way to protect a company from disasters. After the attack on September 11, financial institutions are thinking about making their trading networks and their ISs less vulnerable to disasters. As suggested by Thibodeau, decentralized systems, such as those used by electronic communications networks ECN, did have the least problems and were, actually, intact after the attack. Centralized networks, however, were destroyed and it took quite a while to get them working again, not to mention all the lost data. Steven Randich, CIO at Nasdaq Stock Market Inc, explains to Thibodeau that the best way to secure the information systems is not to harden a single point, but not to provide one point of vulnerability. Giving these circumstances companies should rethink the cost cutting advantage of a centralized IS, in comparison to the effect a terrorist attack or even computer virus can have on such a system.  *********************  References   Dunn, D.
