Some facts are essentially  tensed  [ f 1   is tensed if the truth-value of  f 1   essentially depends on it occurring relative to  now ] 3. Therefore, since God is omniscient and knows tensed facts, he too must exist in a tensed state, which is a fancy way of saying God is temporal.  Premise 1 seems uncontroversial.  Premise 2 requires a tensed understanding of facts, which is the tricky premise.  In short, saying some facts are tensed recognizes that there is a difference in saying: (a) I have a meeting at 4:30 pm Friday; (b) I have a meeting now.  There is something about the reference of  now  that cannot be substituted or translated into other expressions of the same fact.  Premise 3 is a clear consequent from premises 1-2.  Let me add that this is a good thing too.  If God only knows facts tenseslessly, then God would know that you prayed for help at 6:27 pm, Friday, July 3, 2004, but he would not know if you were praying for it now or even if it had already passed.  Without knowledge of the present, God would know a series of facts without knowing when they occurred in relation to  now .  Of course, this assumes the A-theory of time, but perhaps Iâ€™ll blog more about this later.
