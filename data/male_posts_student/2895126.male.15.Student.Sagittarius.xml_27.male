I tried TWICE to change the color and when I did, it just changed it back! ARGGGGH....    And for the occasion, here's a nice (mean) quote about the Irish for today's Quote of the Day. (I promise tomorrow's will be kind.)    The Irish are a fair people - they never speak well of one another.   (Samuel Johnson)
