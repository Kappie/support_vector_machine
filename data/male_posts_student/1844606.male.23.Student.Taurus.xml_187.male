I'm generally a very safe driver, (definately definately a good driver) but I cut off one person and then almost got sideswiped by somone going 60 on 176 and switching lanes without signaling...  Cubs game tomorrow in an attempt to relive a small section of the movie Ferris Bueler...Senior Ditch Day 2004 WHOOO!!!  Though the naughtyness of cutting classes is lessened a) by not having classes on fri.  b) a parent will be attending the game with us and c) we're in college, by this point its expected to not go to class.    And I didn't go to class today.  Rather, I was in class and was convinced (rather easily) to take off and watch the Cubs game.  I also am beginning to not care about my thesis.  Matters are not helped when my advisor has canceled/not shown up/ failed to tell me he couldn't meet with me in the past 3 weeks.  Whatever, I've got 19 pages and 6 pages of quotes I want to use and the paper has to be 25 pages.  You do the math, I'm the English major and I don't care for numbers  I have also begun to "mentor" a freshman in my english 100 class.  He's so cool I didn't think he was a freshman at first. I hope my words, trials and tribulations save him from wicked bad professors.
