Going into Iraq was a stupid useless military action that got the whole world mad at us.  Not only that, but oil prices have gone up astronomically.  Before I go any farther let me elaborate.  Yes; Saddam tortured his citizens.  So does Saudi Arabia.  Why don't we invade Saudi Arabia?  Because they give us oil.  Saddam Sold oil to other middle-eastern countries, who then sold it to us.  Without Saddam, Supply goes down, demand stays the same, and prices go up.  Now about Bush's Speaking habbits:...  "They always misunderestimate me..."  "I am the master of low expectations"  "Our nation must come together to unite"  "I think we agree, the past is over."  "Home is where hope takes flight, where wings take dream."  "I'm not the sharpest marshmallow in the bag"  "the french have no word for 'entrepeneur'"  "I was raised in the west. the west of texas.  It's pretty close to california."  "I think the American people--I hope the american people--I don't think, let me--I hope the american people trust me"  "They want the federal government controlling social secutity like it's some kind of federal program."  And his administration:...  Bush is the only president to be elected with a criminal record.  He has the most convicted criminals in his cabinet.  The poorest member of his cabinet; Condoleeza Rice, is a multimillionaire, and has a chevron oil tanker named after her.  Dick Cheyney is still on the Halliburton payroll.  Bush dumped all his Enron Stock(a considerable amount) just before it crashed.  Not to mention that he was AWOL(absent with out leave) during his tour of duty with the texas national guard, which he joined to prevent himself from going to vietnam.  I could go on, but I think that is enough for today.  Go see Farenhieght 911(Nathan, I will buy you a ticket, give me when)
