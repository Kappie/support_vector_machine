However I am doing Celebrated Weekend articles for a few weeks. What is Celebrated Weekend? I'm glad you asked: American Airlines' inflight magazine runs a regular feature where a celebrity will talk about their favorite city and what they like to do there, where they like to eat and stay. For example, "Martin Sheen's Las Vegas" or "Kiefer Sutherland's Toronto" I thought, "Why don't I do something like that." So I'm doing them about the Compendium gang!   So far I have "Thomas Fowler's Chicago", "Sophia Jacobs' Ireland", "Michael Christie's Los Angeles", "Marten Dollenger's Kalamazoo" and "Erin Chandler's Orlando".  [You can add Nathan Comstock's St. John's]   I'll do these again around this time next year. Hopefully we all can go to many great places between now and then! The Betty-one looks drowsy!
