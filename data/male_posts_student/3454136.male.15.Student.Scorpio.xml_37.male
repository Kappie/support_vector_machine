It's the same old damned procrastination that's gonna one day kill me...  Ah, I'm bored down to the level of M's blog... I would copy and paste my comments but I'm too lazy to do that too...  So anyways, let's c how'd I do when I have nothing in mind to talk about. Hmmm.... Well, I've noticed that commenting others is a LOT easier than writting my own piece. It seems that the creation of a topic is something difficult and something to be considered a skill.  It's times like these, that u wonder about how creativity is useful in our lives. Certainly, we don't need it to stay alive. All we have to do is the do the same thing we do everyday like drones. But we do need it to  live . After all,  living  means going through our lives without acting like drones. It's creativity that introduced all the variance in our lives. Even the great minds that we admire would be nothing without creativity.  Then u come to this... Creativity is the source of all excitement in life, but in turn varience and excitement cause us pain. Sometimes, we think that living like drones wouldn't be as bad as living in pain. That is when we begin to doubt creativity. If I was never creative enough to up with the idea of putting a gun to a teacher's head in my comic assignment, I would've never got in trouble. The same trouble that helped fuel my depression during first semester.  But then, u can argue human nature. Human nature is to survive and advance and it is willing to use creativity as a tool to do that. None of us r above human nature and we can't do anything about it.  I prolly shouldn't think that way... If I justified all my actions with human nature, I just might do something terrible... Cya and I'm off to bed.
