By the way people, lol i had to make a new tag board cuz cbox suck'd, sorry if this one doesnt have smileys but its waaaaaaay better than cbox and it doesnt crash cuz its located into a good server. I'll get a better one soon, so yea post ur messages in that tag board while i setup a new one. byes ppl
