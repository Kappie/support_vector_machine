     
      Okay, I'm searching for a 1960s Airline guitar like the one used by Jack White of the White Stripes (which is a 1965 model, made of a fiberglass called Res-O-Glas). If you know where I could find one, give me information about it. Here's a picture so you know what it looks like.      I prefer it to be the color on the picture, but I need it to be the same body style. There's an article in this months Rolling Stone talking about it. I'll find a link and put it up. Thanks for the help. Oh yeah, if you can help me there's a link to contact me. Thanks yo!
