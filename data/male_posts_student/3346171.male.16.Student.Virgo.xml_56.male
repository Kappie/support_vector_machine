I met her today, and she said that the lady who made the interview liked me more. I was surprising!!!  I know i haven't posted much! I'm becoming lazy, i know.   Winter vacation is closer and closer. Finally i'll have 2 weeks of lazyness -ahahaha-, i'm not gonna travel, just staying at home, boing to the beach, chatting, and of course: sleeping.  Tomorrow is mom's birthday! She's gonna cook lasanha - which i love, i apreciate a lot italian cuizine - and she'll buy a chocolate cake and things else - things else or things elses?-, YAMMY!!!!!!
