The Domestic Air Travel market has witnessed a tremendous boost thanks to the Apex fares Concept started a few months ago. It has made flying affordable to the Upper Middle class which otherwise has been used to travelling in the 2nd/3rd AC's by Train.                                     Sahara has gone a step ahead and introduced online bidding in partnership with indiatimes.com. I was pleasantly surprised when I won a Bid Yesterday for Delhi-Chennai at a price of Rs.2925 (The actual Cost by Jet is Rs.11300 !!) . It has now thrown open the doors for numerous people who otherwise cannot afford the steep air charges. Long live Bidding !! Long live low airfare flying !!
