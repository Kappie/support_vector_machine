This book is packed with a bunch of tips and tricks to make your PC, well, less annoying and more efficient if you will.  It's written by Steve Bass, by the way.  My favourite thing about this book besides how helpful it is, is actually the price point, pretty cheap for a book like this.  I haven't recieved it yet, but I ordered it from Amazon, and should be arriving soon hopefully! Highly recommend you check it out.  You can buy it at either  urlLink amazon.com (American)  or  urlLink amazon.ca (Canadian)  :)      ----------------- Thanks, ~Brian M
