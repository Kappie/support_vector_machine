Not much goin' on here, as if that wasn't obvious.  I'm just kickin' back, but shriveling inside knowin' that school is back in session soon and that vacation is soon goin' to be over...Silent moment for a minute...its just so....so....its unbearable almost...hold on...OK OK, I'm over it, life moves on, blah blah blah...  School is startin' soon (Thank you,  Captain Obvious !)  Fuck, I need a new topic...how many fuckin' times can I remind you guys that school is startin'?  As if you guys didn't fuckin' know already huh?  Anyway, its gonna be a kick ass year...its only gonna suck of you let it suck...oh slightly sexual!  Anyway,  Operation: Revolution  still really hasn't started...Damn, why do I keep statin' the obvious...Well it hasn't started, but its takin' its toll over on the  T.E.W.   I'll blog more on this later...when somethin' acutally develops in this category...  I have nothin' to blog about...I really need to bail!  Sorry guys....this is the worst blog ever!  More to come...!
