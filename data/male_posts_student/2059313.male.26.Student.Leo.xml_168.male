In this particular episode, Ross realizes that the day is the anniversary of his and his lesbian ex-wife's consummation... which was his first time ever.  Later on Chandler and Joey are let in on this and they tell Ross really nice things about "how special that was to wait" and that sort of thing.  After he leaves, they call him a freak.  Now, as you may or may not know, I am a virgin.  Yes, yes, I am.  I'm not ashamed of it, but it's not really something I go around shouting to the hills and so-forth.  Just makes me wonder about the times I  have  told people and they say nice things and sweet things and how it's going to be special and all that, if when I leave they say, "wow, that's really weird, I can't believe there are weirdo's like that around" or other possibly worse scenarios.  My time is not yet, and I'm not looking to rush it, but I don't want to be considered a freak due to something I haven't done.    ANYhoo... that's a bit of a downer, and kind of a shot to the gut.  I need to get my wind back now.
