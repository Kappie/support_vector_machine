Hai Wei wasn't in good form and let in 5 runs which resulted in the change of pitcher, Harng-Yi. Harng-Yi was in a good form and let in no runs from the moment he made his 1st pitch to the moment he made his last pitch. You can easily tell that his pitching is made fit with the opponent's team name. Whenever a team is lousy, it boosts his morale confidence which makes his pitching superb. But whenever he pitches against a good team, he will not be as good. Nicholas Ong ended the game SUPERBLY WHICH HE MADE A 2/3 GRANDSLAM which brings the Marist Team to a 7-5 win. He brought in 3 runs(incuding himself) and was therefore the man of the match(In my personal opinion). The decision of whether This team would get into the 2nd round would depend on the game against PeiCai Full Time Report by Simhyi
