We will fly out the next day from Logan, stopping in Zurich (Switzerland) and then arriving in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  There's going to be a barbecue at my house in two hours (at five), after which we're apparently going to "Farenheit 9/11" at the West Newton.  People other than Jonny, who is already coming, are welcome.  I both anticipate and apprehend the trip, but I'm sure that it will be interesting and entertaining.  For anyone who doesn't already know, I'm going to be there for a month, climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, go on safari, and more.  By "more" I of course mean get AIDS and malaria and die, but whadayagannado.  I'm going to miss people in Newton.  And then Richie's getting back like right after I leave.  As Loren says, they're going to have a "Yay! Richie is back/Alex is gone" party.  As I've said before, I don't know whether I'll be able to send postcards.  If I can, I will.  I come back on July 27.  My birthday is July 31.  So get ready for a big partay when I'm back.  I want to see "Garden State" for that, probably.  See you in a month!
