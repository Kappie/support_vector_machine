If they ask about their weight then there is  NO  answer that is correct. So I made up an answer that should help with those six words,  "Does this make me look FAT?".      Follow the steps:    1.) Don't answer right away or she might think that your just saying shit    2.)Ask her to turn and say the following "no".    3.)She will immediately deny and you must say "no" fast but strong    4.)You are now safe but your going to have to sit for another 2-5 hours. Shoes are another concept entirely.                                                                                               P.S. This is of course not foolproof like                                                     many things in life, but it works                                                      3/4 of the time. Oh ,but do remember                                                     that this is just B.S.
