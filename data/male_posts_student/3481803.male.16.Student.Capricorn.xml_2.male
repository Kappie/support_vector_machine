I certainly hope the Street Fighter anime is signifigantly better than that live action bullshit movie they made sometime in the late/mid 90's. If you dont know what i'm talking about, BE GLAD! That movie damn near ruined my view of the Street Fighter franchise.  The Ninja movie, however, has to be good. You cant go wrong with ninjas.
