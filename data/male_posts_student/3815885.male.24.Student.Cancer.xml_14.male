What is the "base", this root that is grounded deep in our physical being? As a former Drunkard i have tasted the pains of situations that come because of the drunkeness  . . .  BUT God is faithful!   When i put my trust and daily walk in Him He helps me "... overtake the sins that sooo easily beset me." He has made a way of escape from the situations that i find myself in - just in order that i may be able to bear  up under them.   Hw can a young man keep his way pure?  Or, let's rephrase that - how can a young man renew his way?  By following the words of the law, as spoken to the prophets of old. A, friend, i shall call her answered questions in a sincere, logical God fearing way that i have long forgotten - i only wish that I can find myself once again so easily able to crawl into the Father's lap whenever i am lost in this world.  Words from a song by Petra now enter my mind:   We are pilgrims, we are aliens - we are not of this world.  How, if i would only apply these words daily to my walk on this mortal plain; my life would be soo different no bruises and breaks from the demons that ravage the lives of men that have taken me, a former bible college student into depths of sin that i only wish i never knew - But God is faithful - His love for you and me is undending ! HAlelujah - In another portion of scripture it says, "All things work together for good, to them that love God and live according to His purpose -  . . ."  Well, Hallelujah, God can take my "broken pieces" and mend them and make me something beautiful still.  The words to the songs "broken pieces" are:  Have you failed in life's battles to accomplish your plan  Is your heart heavy-laden, do you fear the Lords command  Do you feel that no one loves you, and there's no use to try Just bring your cares to Jesus - your soul he'll satisy  Chorus:  Pick up the broken pieces and bring them to the Lord Pick up, the broken pieces trust in His holy word  He will put you back together and make your life complete Just leave the broken pieces at the Savior's feet  You may feel that there's no hope Broken hearts just cannot mend Tho your torn in many pieces Christ can make you whole again Storms of doubt blow all directions But don't be afraid  God can make all corrections, He made a body out of clay.  I was six or seven when i first heard this song - my mom and dad sang it at church, and i sang it with them for my grandmother and grandpa - you know it's funny i never really understood the song until i came to the point last year when i had nothing to live for - then i went to a Bible study and God wonderously started a change in me that is going to one day make me a beautiful and fit vessel for the lady that He has in mind.  Peace all - if you're still reading - God bless
