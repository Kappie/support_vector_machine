The girl worked on Christmas and New Years Hadn't gotten a day off in *two* years She begged her employer But he is a lawyer So she's stuck with one more of her *blue* years.  There once was a man who was short Who was sued for committing a tort He thought state court unpleasant Gave the plaintiff a present And removed it to federal court  The judge said there's issue preclusion Leaving John in a state of confusion Though he'd studied at Yale Always passed when pass/fail Seems the J.D. is just an illusion  Santa came with the presents you got But as he walked towards the tree he was shot In this state, the law said You can fill them with lead When they enter your house, on the spot.
