Anyway... between June 16 and June 30, 1938 in the LA Times, there were minimal mentions of  Blockade . I suppose I'll go through some of July...  I forgot to ask my teacher if I can take time off and what the assignment is...  Well off to work... I'm exhausted and don't really want to go... bleh...  **
