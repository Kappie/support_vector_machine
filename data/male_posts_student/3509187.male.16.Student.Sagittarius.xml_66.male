Nothing to great happened all day... just another boring day of stuff... the highlight had to be being Partied by Robin... haha I feel so bad for anyone who missed the beginnings of Party. But... After school Angela D, Chad, Meg Hoover, Brandon, and almost Stosh (Grama stole him away...) went to Big Eats and studied for Wade's world history final... and had way to much fun.  HaHa wow so yeah I don't know if I'll do any better on my final but I know it was nice to do something fun after school. I never really knew Meg Hoover before, shes a pretty funny person. while eating some french (or are they still freedom) Fries: Meg: "Just so you all know I'll be running tonight" Brandon: "Running what?" Meg (with no hesitation): "My Mouth"  And you know whats really fun about it all... We are doing it again tomorrow... WHOO. you can tell I don't get out much...  So I guess thats all for now... I'll be back with more later maybe... I'm to lazy to think of anything else I wanted to say right now...  -Dan V
