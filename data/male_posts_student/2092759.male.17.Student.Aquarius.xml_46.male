I don't belong here  I don't care if it hurts, I want to have control I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul I want you to notice, when I'm not around You're so very special I wish I was special  But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here, ohhh ohhhh  She's running out.... She's running out, she's run, run, run, run....run....  Whatever makes you happy Whatever you want You're so very special I wish I was special But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here I don't belong here
