Most recently, I've been listening to Adore's version of "Your Love O Lord", since it's one of our new songs for Oneighty. I really must say, they did an excellent job at creating a new and much better version of the song. I think all the versions of the songs they play for worship sound better than the originals, there's just something about them. I was kind of bummed this year at Elevate when they didn't play, but Yancy did an excellent job! I also really enjoy her music. It's great to see them live to see what awesome musical talents God has given them. Anyhow, before I bore all of you to death with my bad writing skills, I'll head out. PLEASE make some comments...... things you want me to talk about, questions you have, etc.
