The only thing I'm worried about is that only 1 or 2 girls will show up (hopefully, many show up - if you can come and are not a male then I'd like to see you there, prolly your brother or someone is going anyway if you are reading this and if you know who I am ;)   ).  "A recent survey stated that the average person's greatest fear is having to give a speech in public. Somehow this ranked even higher than death which was third on the list. So, you're telling me that at a funeral, most people would rather be the guy in the coffin than have to stand up and give a eulogy." - Jerry Seinfield
