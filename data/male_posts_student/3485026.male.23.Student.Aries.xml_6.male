This past weekend Jackie and I went camping with my familiy and I met my (step)nephew for the first time and was able to spend some time with him.  It made me realize more than before how much I want a kid, and more to the point, how much I want the experience of being a father.  I get doses of solitude in my daily life, I get little doses of fellowship when I talk to friends online, be it email or instant messenging.  I get large doses of fellowship whenever I am able to talk to a friend on the phone or meet up and have dinner, hang out, and so forth with one or a group of friends.  I get doses of love whenever I talk to Jackie, and almost always become overwhelmed with it when we can just be with each other.  I get doses of the divine when I pray, meditate, and take in the wonder of the world around me.  I get all of this, yet I still feel a yearning...I know some of it is a spiritual yearning, to have a deeper understanding and relationship with the Divine, but after the past weekend, I feel that some of it is also a yearning to be a father.  Just a matter of being patient I guess....    I have been thinking more and more lately about the spiritual yearning/emptiness/hunger that I have been feeling.  It never seems to predominant me, but it seems like it is always just there, nagging at me for some reason.  I have gone to church in the last few weeks, but I have never been able to put myself forward and worship like that...just not me.  At SJC, I got involved with retreats and Faith Group and I think that really was my form of worship, and enabled me to really connect with God more so than ever before.  This last year at law school, I got involved with the Christian Legal Society and the Bible Study, and I think that came close to do the same thing, closer to the kind of worship that I think I am able to best do and form the best relationship with God.  More and more, I realize that whatever church Jackie and I end up attending in the future, I need to be looking for one that has a lot more than just the Sunday worship, one with small informal gatherings of people dicussing faith, God, life, and experiencing fellowship in that way.  Anyway, like I said at the very beginning, getting hungry so I am going to make some dinner...
