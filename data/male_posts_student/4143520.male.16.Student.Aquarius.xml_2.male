But i don't care. If i want to make a post with images in it, I'll go to the website and post it through the wysiwyg-editor.  If you (i saw an unknown person commented by last post, so maybe i got a few readers..) know any other bloggin-software for linux which uses gtk: let me know.    edit: Oh, i just saw that gnome-blog fucked up this post. It doesn't handle titles of postings and new-line-breaks. Damn.
