After morning services we went over to the Brodies for a cookout/devo. It was crazy. On the way there I hit every possible red light on red... except the one where I had to turn right. Figures. But yeah. The cookout was fun. The burger was a little on the done side (aka burnt) but it was still rather good. I played alot of chess. I beat Rachel. And then brutally annihilated Kenneth. Then there was Fannie Mare. We were trying to teach her how to play. Well, she beat me. That's most likely do to the fact that she had like, thirty people giving her tips and hints. Ok, maybe only four or five; but still, that's alot of people to be playing against. She couldn't make a bad move. Well, the second game went pretty much the same way. I was down to three pieces. Then she  finally  made a mistake, and within three moves I had her in check-mate. But yeah. We sang some songs and had a devo. Then we watched a slide show of some of the summer. It was kinda short, but oh well, it happens. That's about it for the cookout. Well, for evening services, Jason preached. It was good. He had a picture of him "extending discipline", or whatever, on me. (he was knee-ing me in the stomach (it was posed (duh))) ANYway... After church we all had to say buy to Austin and Morgan. Man, I really wish they didn't have to go. ugh. But yeah. Then Julie  Dave and Bon  I watched a movie. Confesions of a Teenage Drama Queen. Funny here and there. I wouldn't choose to watch it again. But yeah. It's all in the company. Well, that's today and it's events.
