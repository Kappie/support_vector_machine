For example, if I asked someone to go to a movie but I wasn't high on their list, I'd be turned down. Even if a whole group of people were going. Now, if they actually liked someone else that I mentioned was going, they might go along with it. But they'd be much more likely to go if someone they were fond of asked them. It's a general rule that if a person you really like wants to spend time with you, you'll try and make it happen even if it's not all that convenient for you.For somebody you don't like all that much, it's the opposite: you'll find any excuse possible to get out of it. Now, when I say 'somebody you don't like' I really mean 'somebody you like, but not as much as a lot of other people.' This is all pretty obvious, but I am always amused by it. Sometimes when I'm trying to recruit people to go do something together, I know that So-and-So is going to turn me down, not because of what I'm asking but because of who I am. But I ask anyway, probably because they're higher on my list than I am on theirs. It's too bad that we as humans can't be less biased when it comes to dealing with other people. It's incredibly arrogant of us when you think about it. This is another obvious fact about human nature that I'm wasting words on anyway. Oh well. I never claimed to be revolutionary. I'm just writing about what I observe in others and myself.
