Although the publication at my school could be much better--and I have seen better from other area schools--I am, nevertheless, proud to be part of the production. Hopefully with my experience from this year, I can personally improve while aiding the newspaper along the way. I just find news writing far more difficult than any other journalistic writing, especially in high school. Seriously, what significant news is there in a Wichita high school?
