One should watch it for the purpose of having that experience. PPV or Blockbuster. Choose one.  There is a lady who works at the pharmacy who is well past my age. She has pale skin and black curly hair and this wonderful smile that she gives to everyone; quite attractive. I think I have a crush on her. This, however, is a bad thing, for, as I stated, she is in her mid-thirties, whereas I am but an adolescent. Damn age barrier.  Searching for a companion...and still unsuccessful. I am so ready for college to steal me away right now. Bloody senior year of high school. I am ready to escape this drab city for other locales. And other possibilities for lifestyles.  Zoe is one of the most precious people I know. Wonderful and adorable.  The internship today was lethargic. All morning I was half asleep, whilst sorting files of patients and trying to find if this woman recieved genetic counseling or totally ignored the cancer institute's calls. However, Dr. Fowler (director of Dept. of Genetics at Baptist and my employer) used my information on his rare disease presentation. A special rush of energy for seeing that. Dr. Neese (Dr. Fowler's co-worker person) and I made fun of Dr. Fowler while he was presenting. In front of the research nurses and oncologists. Sorry about that, Dr.  I need sleep. Check-up tomorrow. First time in about six years. Cheers and dream quiet dreams.
