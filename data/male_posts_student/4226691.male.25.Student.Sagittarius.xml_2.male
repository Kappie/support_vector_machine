Download, games, music, you name it. But me and my labtop toshiba? I'm online right now, and I am probably getting like a thousand viruses. I can't explain it. It is frustrating the hell out of me. That's life though, very frustrating.  So, at first, I downloaded sophos online...and it worked ok, but it didn't really do anything- I mean apart from letting me know that there were viruses...very good alert system, but not really good at doing anything. So I decide to buy Norton Antivirus with Spam-blocker....Oh, and for some reason, Adware has taken complete control of my computer. In any case, it does it's scan, and is able to obliterate a number of viruses and other hang-ups...but it also seems to be more about alerting to viruses then to deleting them...I still have to go on safe mode and manually delete the buggers. It pisses me off.  What is perhaps more frustrating is that I am now blocked from downloading music from Kazaa and Morpheus. It's not like I download all the time or huge amounts of music files...I mean I still only have dial-up. But I still like the ability to do so, and for some reason, you can only get these features with ads-support---which conflicts directly with Norton's anti-spam rhetoric. So, the two are battling it out, and canceling each other out in the meantime. Again, mega-frustrating. I am not yet ready to give up, but I damn near ready to go insane.  But, I have options...but they all involve me spending some money---which it turns out I have little of these days...crazy I know. So, I am willing to live with my computer having some viruses. Fine. If it goes a little slower, then so be it. I rather it be free to do what I need to do then to be ultra-protected---like having seven condoms on---and it isn't helping make the mood right. How could you feel anything at that stage?  Onto to other topics of giving up---I think I have given up officially on this person I liked. I mean, more than liked at one point, and I still have dreams about them, and when I hear a stupid song, there is their shit-eating grin. But, I am trying to be realistic about things, about my chances, about this person...and the more I think about it, they are not all that they are cracked up to be. They have numerous and big-time flaws, and only stupidity has caused me not to see them before now. I mean, you give them a call, you say you want to talk one more time, and they seemingly agree to do so after they get back from some summer vacation. Of course, I agree that I should have had inquired further about when they were returning...but I didn't want to be all in their business---this was supposed to be a talk about moving on.  So now- three weeks or so have passed, and I am fairly certain that they must be back by now. And i'm not going to do a damn thing...first- I am tired of always be strong and of being the one with more guts...fuck that. Second, I am getting really busy with work, school, being the prez of my org, trying to better myself without regressing. Third, I am not as passionate about my feelings as I used to be. I'm not saying that I don't give a damn anymore, cuz I certainly do, but I'm not at such a point that my whole existence is centered around this person anymore. It is both a refreshing and terrifying feeling...but I hope that this will be past me soon.  note** I think I am regressing---since I am feeling slightly turned on by someone exactly like this last idiot...I got to stop being the perpetual idiot myself.  My dad's "disk slipped!" What does this mean? I have no idea, but I know it has to do with his back, that he is in a lot of pain, and that the status quo is continuing. I feel bad for my Dad, and my mom who has to deal with all this. But I am getting a little fed up with one problem after another. I don't understand why after all of these years, his body is just all of a sudden giving out on him. No warning, no signal that all is not well. Just one day- back goes out, stroke, cancer, surgery, hip has issues, headaches, neck problems, and now a disk slips! It would make any sane person go straight from sane to kookoo over insane.  To top it all off, it's his b-day weekend, which is just horrible. I feel bad, I feel angry, and I feel irritated. Not a good combination. There is nothing I can do to help...which makes things worse. I hope my mom can make it through this ok, but I am unsure. She is already depressed, losing a lot of weight, and on edge.  So, I have tried to look for this song called Ladykillers by Lush. Back in the mid-1990's, Lush was an up-and coming alternative act from England that had this big-hit. But then one of their peeps died somehow and they have never been heard since. Ladykillers was a cool song, but that doesn't mean I want to buy like their whole album...I did that with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and Maps is still their best song by far...nothing else on that album comes close. In any case, I try to download from my computer....which just so happens to be right in the middle of those issues I brought up earlier. So, I ask my roommate with the perfect computer to download this song and others for me....and he is able to download almost all of the songs I ask for in less then an hour....it would have taken me like three days or so. Except for the song I really wanted....Ladykillers. Is it so hard to find just one song?? It is terrible. I am still frustrated...and the frustation continues---there is no food in this place, and I have no money...but for some reason, I do have lots of gum...hmm.  E
