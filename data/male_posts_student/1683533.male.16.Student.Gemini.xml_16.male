I am watching the British Open...it's wierd I used to hate watching golf, but now I don't mind....maybe because I golf more now.....I hope Tiger Woods wins...I always was a Tiger Fan...He really hyped up the sport and got more people involved.  2 more days till the new Riverdales Album comes out!...I still have no idea where I am gonna buy it...it is probably going to be kinda hard to find....I might get lucky and find it at Best Buy...they have Ben Weasel's other albums....but if all else fails I can get it offline at Look Out! Records.com....  I smell cinammon rolls!....mmmm....I guess that is it for now....sorry if you have been searching for more controversy like my old posts, but I haven't had much to rant and rave about lately....later!
