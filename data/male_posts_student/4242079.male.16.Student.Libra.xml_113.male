Anyway, Haloscan records these IP addresses so that I can go back and see who posts from what computer. Using this method, I have found anonymous. It saddens me to know the true identity of this person, as I feel a great friendship has come to an end. Oh well. Easy come, easy go.        posted at 5/26/2003 07:00:16 PM       urlLink  postCount('whoyouare');
