As i approached, there was another couple that was getting into the car next to mine. It was one of those moments. I waited while they climbed in their minivan. The lady getting into the passenger seat finally noticed me as i awaited. She apologized. Isn't that interesting? Someone apologizing for getting in their car? I've been thinking about it. I can't seem to come to any conclusions. The thing is, if i had gotten there a split second before, she would have waited for me and i would have apologized. Why are people so apologetic and polite while getting in their cars, but once inside, they become animals, cutting each other off, flipping each other off, speeding, raging. So there i was, standing next to my car, unlocking it. They started their car up then, and the tailpipe sputtered wet, mucus-containing, exhaust onto my legs. I stood there helpless, feeling like my feet were cemented into concrete while someone was throwing up on them. The minivan had no idea. They drove off and i got into my truck, a little upset. And i became an animal, raging and speeding home.  The life of automobiles.  I am reminded of the time i went down to visit my friends Steve and Jen A. In Saint Louis. I was there for a few days before summer class started up. I was supposed to be back Monday for the start of a three week, pre-session class. I left Sunday morning, and not 20 miles from my departure, my truck broke down. After an interesting afternoon, and a day full of God's blessing, a thought-provoking ride with a tow-truck driver, i was back at Steve and Jen's house that night. I thought it would be polite to call my professor of my class, to let him know the situation and to seek his advice. After all, he is not only my professor, but also my advisor, and i have known him for a number of years. His name is Dr. Dvorak. For those of you that don't know him, i wish i could explain to you what he is like. But its very difficult. I will try. He always talks to everyone with a radio-voice. Full of ups and downs, very lively and clear, like his whole life he is broadcasting a commercial for a new type of housecleaner. He has a doctorate in Civil Engineering, but also has a degree in philosophy and psychology. Interesting combination, i must say. He is extremely well organized and has lists of things he wants to say, not only during class, but during short meetings with people, during which he might only have one simple thing to say. He is kind. So i called his office at 8pm on Sunday. He was there, mysteriously. He answered in a deep, mischievous voice, that made me think he was decoding some sort of algorithm for cold-fusion. I said that is was me, and i went on to explain the situation. Now, you have to understand that this class is only three weeks long. Class is 8 hours every day. And to miss one day would be like missing a week of class. So i asked him, partially out of respect and fake enthusiasm for the class, if i should get a bus ticket to get to town the next day for class. I asked what he wanted me to do. He responded seriously with a line that i will always remember, word for word, with a smirk: "Unfortunatly, we live in a society that revolves around the automobile. I would hate for you to leave your car there...I will leave that decision up to you." isn't that great? If only all our answers in life were straight of a dictionary/encyclopedia/etiquette book. If only our lives were lived out of an etiquette book.  So im supposed to be working on homework right now. I have been all afternoon, and i decided to take a break. But a little man in my head is telling me im supposed to be doing homework. You know what little man in my head: "Back off, i gotta take breaks, so i dont break, gimme a break" Ah, feel better already.  If you were an animal right now, what would you be? I think i would be a locust. I wouldn't mind being in some trees right now, in the wilderness, singing, swaying.  Here is a poem i wrote in April. I was probably in a bad mood, sitting by some people who thought they were pretty smart when i wrote it. Its titled:  I Bet You Thought This Song Was,  and it starts like this: "Hey" Enjoy. and Peace.  I Bet You Thought This Song Was  Hey colleagues We should get together to discuss issues of the world And ponder deep philosophical debates And relate Maybe we will sound smart And people will walk by and listen in And think highly of us Want to be one of us We can feel loved Like part of something important A community unmatched Detached Maybe we'll write a book That millions will read We'll go down in history And we'll smile and chuckle And bite our pencil tips While cocking our heads and looking deep in thought Like we are brilliant Then we will look out of the corner of our eyes To see if anyone's watching
