I found out early on when they were outlining the schedule for the ceremony that the prize for the winner of best paper wasn't in fact a full scholarship but a book scholarship--a few thousand dolars for books for college.  I was a little disappointed at that but I was still hoping for a win, I knew I had a good chance but I was just afraid that I wouldn't make the cut for some reason or another.  Well after a few speeches, the certificates were handed out, we were called up by name and as I accepted my certificate, one of the program coordinators shook my hand and said, "You had an awesome paper."  After that I knew I was definitely in for at least 3rd place.  After all the certificates were handed out, he honorable mentions were announced.  There were two of them and I willed myself not to be one of them.  I hate nothing more in life than being in 2nd or 3rd place.  I was in the clear after the two honorable mentions and waited eagerly to hear my name.   "And the winner of our 2004 book scholarship for surpassing all possible expectations of what a research paper is supposed to be, Anghel Rendon [they pronounced my name the spanish way]!"     I was on such a high, I didn't even smile, I went down and played it reeeaaal cool.  I felt so awesome.  The best part of all though, was that everyone got dressed up for the ceremony--dresses, suits, women's suits, ties, the works.  Me, I came in my most torn up old ass hand-me-down jeans, with rips and tears all over the place.  And a t-shirt that belonged to my oldest brother when he was my age. [He's 22 now]  I felt like such a careless, really smart rockstar.  The most annoying member of the program was this really prissy, over achiever type girl, and she was all dressed up, and her mom was sitting behind her with a bouquet of flowers--she didn't even get an honorable mention!  I thought she was my biggest competition for the win!  I am really feeling good about myself.  Not to mention, one of the two honorable mentions went to a kid that also goes to my school!  Email me if you want to read my winning research paper--not that ANYONE is gonna take me up on that--I just didn't feel like I was finished tooting my own horn, haha.  angelrendon@optonline.net
