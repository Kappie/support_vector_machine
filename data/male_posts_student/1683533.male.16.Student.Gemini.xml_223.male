Here are the bands i would for sure go see:   Bouncing Souls      The Casualties      Avenged Sevenfold       Planetsmashers      Silence The Wake      Bowling For Soup      Half the Battle      From Here on Out      Before I Go      The Rivercity Rebels     It really makes my day to see bands like Silence The Wake, Half The Battle, and From Here On Out, and Before I Go hit the Warped tour. These are bands I saw at the Knights of Colombus or other local venues, just trying to get heard. I am really happy to see them getting on the Warped Tour, they deserve it. :)  So now im thinking about it, and if i can spare the cash i think i might go.  Oh yea, I caught a glimpse of the new Rivercity Rebels site, and wow, at first on the home page the pic is racy and funny, and I didnt think much of it, but if you get further into the site...i cant believe they dont have an 18 and up disclaimer haha, watch out little ones!
