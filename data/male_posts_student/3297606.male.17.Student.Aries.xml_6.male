Tyler spewed a mike-made-mixture of pickle juice, milk, and some strange very strong and putrid smelling substance all over mike's kitchen, that was interesting.  Ben is back, yes... he is. The king city fair did a splode and he martyred outta there like 4 is after 3.  were all getting back into paintball / airsoft... meaning, some are getting back into paintball, while others into airsoft. There has always been a think line separating the two, and as time goes on, people are starting to stick to one or the other. hopefully people lighten up and play both again, but every time you mention airsoft to a paintballer they have to go off whining about how much better paintball is. I guess they dont realize its a matter of opinion, because it never seems to stop, no matter how much people tell them. (not naming any names TYLER). If i had to choose one, it would be airsoft, but hopefully i wont have to choose one or the other, hopefully the hostilities toward one another cool down.  anyway, so yea, i think im gonna get into airsoft a lot... and tyler mike and 3 other guys started a pball team, so i probably wont be playing paintball as much because every time tyler or mike will wanna play theyll just go with their team, understandably. but yea, me jon and a good group of other guys got airsoft, so im happy with that. i just hope every once in a while all the airsofters and paintballers merge to a big game of paintball, or a big game of airsoft (i can dream right?).  so yea, lifes OK i guess, school sucks to the max, along with a lot of other stuff, but hey im blessed so i cant complain too much... pshhh running outta things to talk about. oh... today i heard that Hitler is in fact not dead, but re-birthed as a stick of butter. he plans to become the first stick of butter to dictate a country while smoking pot at least 97% of the time. sweet.
