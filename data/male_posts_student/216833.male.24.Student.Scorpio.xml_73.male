I had nothing to offer anybody except my own confusion." - Jack Kerouac  That is pretty much what I felt like last night. I have this desire to be in a band. I love all the fun shit - playing and rocking out - merch - websites - mp3s - promotions. All of that, I find enjoyable. I just forget how much time it all takes.   To be in a fucking good band - you have to have mad dedication, commitment, and you gotta find some bad ass mofo's to rock out with every night. That being said, I have the upmost fucking respect for guys and gals who stick together, tour their ass's off, and rock out every chance they get. I just don't have the love for it like once upon a time.   Music is something I love - but it's not my only interest. No - I don't have a.d.d. I love rocking out - with my friends or in my car even, it something I totally enjoy. I am just working on time management alot and it seems that from 7pm to 12 midnight is alot of time to fuck around. Don't get me wrong - I like hanging out and just running around. I just need that strong passion about the music to spend endless hours on writing music that always seems to die in less than 5 years.  I met nick, christy [nick's friend], eric and venessa at the veggie garden. I can't stand that place. The people freak me out and it just looks dirty. Plus I can't stand the whole mock meat thing. I eat alot of junk and I'm sure its just as unhealthy as synthetic food. I just think that is a little OVER processed. I had tofu and veggies.  We rode out to the practice place south west of downtown I think. I was taking in the totally experience of going out to this place. It was right out of punk rock legends. Posters and flyers all up and down the dank old halls of this place. Looked to me like some old school - there were kids making noise for sure.  It was an event to say the least. I was the fill-in drummer for the night. I was pretty fucking sweaty when we rolled out of there. I was so thirsty and dry'd up. I went by a closed convience store - got pissed and went home.  I love going home - I sneak into the bedroom around 1AM right after I'd spend some 'winddown time' on the patio. mimi just laid there sleeping soundly in one of my button-up shirts. She always looks so comfortable when she is sleeping. I was comfortable too.      Go read a kobo abe book! I am about to pick up 'The Box Man' and start in on that.
