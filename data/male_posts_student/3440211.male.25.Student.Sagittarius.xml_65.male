We both have strong characters and when something pisses us off that is it.. it blows in all possible directions. I saw her today and we spoke again that is all good. I just need her to spend more time with me and all will be fine...   I care for her and I was really distrought to have her cry and leave me like that.  Otherwise the week-end was spent trying to forget the absolute loneliness that she had left behind. Football on sunday and more beer on satruday than I ever thought was the highlight of it.  My life is a chaos. But its out of there that I extract my creativity constance nullifies my-self and I can no longuer think straight... or bent should I say.  Mood: things are better ....
