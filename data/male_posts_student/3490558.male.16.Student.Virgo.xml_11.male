We visited the most beautiful beaches in the world, got to know a bit of Brasilian history and partied at the biggest and best clubs in the country. Tambem foi otimo porque eu namorei. I just wanna holla out to al the guys especially the Musketeers and say I love you all and miss you like 8-track tapes.
