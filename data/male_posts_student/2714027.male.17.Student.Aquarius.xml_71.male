The whole university sits astride Oxford Road - the busiest bus route in Europe - in the centre of the city. It doesn't feel remotely rural or suburban, but metropolitan from every angle. There's an interesting mix of very old and mid-20th century buildings, with no noticeably new ones. The university is fairly clustered, but very big.  The computer science building feels modern and is currently being refurbished. The school of computing is very highly regarded and rated, being the first one of its kind in the country. The facilities you'd expect are present and students I chatted with were positive about the place; all chose it as their first choice.   Noticably, there were more girls at the open day than boys (not a bad sign!), although the computer science talks had a predictable male attendance bias.  Accommodation was closed, but we went on a tour of it anyway and it seems similar to Birmingham. Self catered flats would still be my first choice I think. Interestingly, gap year students aren't put together like at Birmingham.  Tomorrow is a day off, and then monday is a trip to Nottingham.
