We bought some Ribena and sweets u can't buy in America there.  We then went to H.E.B. to do the weekyl shopping.  The American kids started school today from their longer summer holiday!  Haha, nerrrrr :P  Today we went to Toys R Us for the Pokemon tour currently going on in the US.  We took our gameboys and got free Pokemon stuff, it was really cool, and it was only a little set up in the car park, plus they came in a Pikachu car!! (See Pictures Five).  We got an Eon Ticket swipe card for the Pokemon gameboy game plus, a poster, a toy and cool little badges.  Plus, it was probably less crowded due to the American kids being at school, they missed the whole thing rofl!!  See the new 'Pictures Five' section for snaps from San Angelo and today :)  Good Night..ZzZz
