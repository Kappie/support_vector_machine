Unlike other schools, I think, we send everyone with an A average for the whol year. From what I've heard, some schools only send the top 10 or 20 A averages. But of course it's just our schools Acamdemic Banquet and I guess we can do what we want. still hope we don't have to dress up, because I don't really feel like it. I don't think I will anyway.  On other news, Patchou has annouced that the release of  urlLink MsgPlus! 3  will be on the week of May 16th. This was annouced yesterday at what it says 3:19 AM. Who knows what time zone, but that's nt what matters. If you haven't heard of MsgPlus! (Messenger Plus!) then you might wanna check out the site. It's for MSN Messenger. It has a lot of features, but I hear the new release is even better. I guess we will all have to wait. Here's a quote from the site.     Originally posted by Patchou  Hello everyone,  in case you would be a beta tester, a translator or someone else who wants to talk to me, you should know that I'll be gone (to Los Angeles, check out other threads) until thursday. I would have liked to give the final release date of Plus!3 before I go but that's unfortunately impossible right now. However, I can affirm one thing: the release will be made during the week of the 16th, so you don't have much more to wait :).  Thank you for your support everyone! if I'm taking these 3 days of vacations, it's thanks to you .  Patchou     Of course the whole thread can be found  urlLink here. Well, that's all. Wish me luck. Maybe I'll hae some fun. On a side note: I can't wait until MsgPlus!3 comes out!
