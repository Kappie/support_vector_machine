I got my essay back (98% Yay!!!) but found I didn't study the appropriate material to likely get more than a passing grade on the test. Ah well, you win some... I probably would have got 99% on my essay if I hadn't spelled the intructors name wrong (duh!). She was a good teacher though. Interesting to listen to and liked to impart information by way of storytelling. On to the next semester.
