(simple... she doesn't ask me haha...) we do have them ... but then he starts asking weird deep questions ... like what do you want to do with your life... or he just simply has been asking.. on a five minute loop "are you ok nate... you sure... ok ... " (then he sort of looms and stares at me) ...now what am i supposed to do with that... i just say yeah... uh i have hw.. which i do... but.. anyways... uh gf report.. same as always...im still working on it... but results... no ... none... its cool... i guess sixteen years of disappointments will leave you without serious expectations.... but like i said i am working on it... i have faith that SOMEDAY i will actually be successful.. but until then (i still dont understand the fact that i have loads of girl - friends, but no girlfriend... make sense to anyone else?)... but times are decent otherwise... life is a bitch... but its moving pretty fast lately and i dont really have time to realize how shitty it is until im getting raped by something else.... so yeah.... im gonna go finish hw and go to bed.. its midnight.... night everyone...
