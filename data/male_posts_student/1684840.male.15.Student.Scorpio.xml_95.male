I caught up with them and James was attacking Kayla lol  Next thing we knew, Kayla's yoghurt was splatted right between James' legs! lmao!!  He walked all the way to Tescos looking like he had been up to something rather lude, then finally changed into his games kit.  And from what I heard, Sophie's tomato soup came alive and soaked a few people at the benches! What a day!  Maybe everyone was so exited that... *drumroll*... THE EXAMS HAVE FINISHED!!  Back to boring old school work yay!
