Seems like I haven't done anything significant and it's already over......Yeah it's time to have a moment of silence........To honor all the three years of learnings we had that prepared us for this exam.  Anyways, how did everyone else feel about the test? (Remember, NEVER discuss Multiple choice questions.......lol).
