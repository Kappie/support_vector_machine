Livie laughed, probably more to avoid an argument about whether or not the nude, retarded pervert joke was actually funny than because it was actually funny, then said that as a child the word pervert had always confused me. All children seem to be a little mixed up over the words meaning. They are always saying things like, “Eww! Jimmy farted! He’s a PERVERT!” As an adult you know that in fact Jimmy is just a nasty little fucker and not really a pervert at all. Or at least, you know that if he is a pervert it has nothing to do with his nasty farting ass. Even though kids seem to be mixed up by the words meaning, they all seem to know it and use it. Where do they all learn it? We as adults don’t use that word much. We don’t go around saying, “Geeze, I don know if I want to invite Florian to the party. He’s kind of a pervert you know.”    THE DIFFERENCE:   There are so many differences between the citizens United States and the citizens of other countries around the world. Here is a short list of some that I think are particularly interesting. 1) People in other countries almost always have bigger noses, but their big noses look good and sexy on them. 2) The men of foreign lands all have huge rock-hard cocks. 3) People in other countries are not afraid of anything. Some examples of things that they are not afraid of include: Making a scene in a restaurant, death, fighting someone way way bigger and spitting on the floor. 4) The people of other lands always listen to shitier music, but have more fun listening to it. 5) Outside the US people are totally unembarrassed to show off their unusual talents. These talents might include: Making realistic animal sounds, singing some sort of rare type of song, doing some sort of rare dance or balancing things on their huge rock-hard cocks. Some Americans do fit these molds!  So I wonder should I have been a foreigner? And if not where are the Americans like this?  Still single but I am okay with it.  Not to say the American guys aren't still very hott, like Nathan or Jared... But more a statement of the thoughts that ramble.  nathan on the one side is a ver attractive man with his head on striaght and a future bright and rosy, I would seriously consider this boi, a desirable Ammerican, maybe to the extent of a foreigner.  And Edwin was unbelievably rude to me, but it is realy not a big deal.  Jared is like so amazing, he is a gaurdian of sorts.  So anyways to my rambling...       Have you experienced the “deep freeze” one too many times?    You know the feeling...you’re happily typing along when, all of a sudden, you just freeze solid.  As you wait (and wait) for someone with a heater to answer your distress call, you wonder just how much longer you can live. Maybe it’s time to take advantage of one of those great offers you’ve been seeing. “Dude, you gotta get a space-heater!” Or a blow drier, or some fucking matches, or something.  I think can help. My advice is to share your chocolate, love and flowers with those you love. I shared mine with Big Mama and Dad and I am as warm as a clam--happy too.  Music geeks aggravate me. If you ask me they're just about the lowest form of elitist asshole imaginable. I hate anyone who acts superior really, but the music geeks just hit something in me. the way a clerk at your local record pit will sigh and look down their nose at you because you're asking for what you want to hear, not the latest greatest electronic Christian rock piano cum polka band that's "exploding" all across the Netherlands. It just seems to me that they're over-compensating for something. maybe they feel insecure in their intelligence so they need to become unassailable by accumulating libraries of trivial and arcane facts about bands and songs no ones that only other music geeks know about, so anyone who doesn't immediately know what they're talking about obviously just doesn't "get it" well fuck that. Music to me is very simple, when I’m in an angry mood, I listen to angry music. When I’m feeling down, I listen to melancholy stuff. When I’m happy, I listen to happy music. I could-not-care-less about the "the industry" I don't give a fuck how much money x band is making when they should be making something else. I don't care about the ethics of record labels, or industry execs. You don't like me? Don’t sign the fucking contract. Put the music on the net. But I digress... i listen to what i want, because i want to listen to it. For instance I didn't stop listening to metallica because of napster... them being assholes and money-grubbing bastards; I stopped listening to them because their music turned to crap! It always changes over time (what I listen to) so I’ve never bothered compiling a favorites list. I spent a good 2 years listening to the grateful dead, Dylan and the like, but it just doesn't interest me anymore, so I don't listen to it anymore. These days I’m spending a lot of time listening to linking park. I don't care that they're typical of the music scene today (early 2004) I don't care that it's "angsty nu-metal" I don't care how much money they make, or if they even believe in what they say, I truly don't. The end product is all that's important. Vincent van Goh and Pablo Picasso were pretty fucked up guys... does that make their art any less important? Roman Polanski was awarded the Oscar of best director for The Pianist. While I personally think that movie was incredibly bland and wooden, vast amounts of people obviously didn't care that he couldn't be at the awards to accept... because he was in Europe fleeing charges of raping a 16 year old girl! And so I listen to Linkin Park. Whatever they may be "about" their music means something to me. it's so appropriate to what’s going on in my life right now it's scary, and it makes me feel I’m not the only one who's felt the pain I’m feeling. Any music geek worth his salt would scoff if I told him I liked Linkin Park. he would chuckle condescendingly at me at regurgitate whatever argument he's read in whatever trendy "underground" music magazine he reads, then shake his head at my naiveté. Fuck that. Hipsters are almost exactly the same. Most hipsters are music geeks and vice-versa. I’ve come to believe that hipsters are kind-of the new punk. Both are just laughable to me, punk and its new incarnation. Both groups (I will not acknowledge them as philosophies, they're just clubs) spout the same tripe; individualism, rage against the system, rebellion, tearing down caste systems, pseudo-intellectualism, beatnik living, and free-thought. The truth is both groups were and are more rigid, more doctrinaire and totalitarian then the systems they purport to hate. I’ve seen punks take 2 hours getting their hair just-so before heading out for a night of mischief. They all look the same, the all say the same things, they all listen to the same music, they all go to the same clubs, and they all think they "get it". Hipsters have the distinction of looking even more retarded then punks. the only nice thing I can think of saying is that for the most part these people grow up (if they don't burn out or get killed/thrown in jail) to be pretty decent people, usually very liberal and honest, but even then they still carry that elitist mentality, they just water it down to "oh they just don't know any better *sips current trendy wine*" instead of their previous "man the whole world is so STUPID! WE know what's going on here, we're so smart *heavy drag off joint/bottle/needle*" same goes for Goths, and probably a dozen other cliques I’m forgetting. Fucking sheep. My utopia is something like this: picture a nice pastoral setting, rolling hills, lush forests, like southern Europe... or the shire if that's easier. First of all there's no religion (I’ll get to religion in a big...), people are more enlightened then to believe in that shit. There’s tranquility, no ones rushing anywhere. There are no cars. People walk, or ride bikes, or horses. Long distance is achieved by bullet trains that go faster then the speed of sound. There is no monetary system, everyone simply get's what they need. Every house grows its own food, or picks it up from the market. People don't hoard things, there's no need, and again... people are simply more enlightened than that. Everyone does what they want. People that enjoy building build people that enjoy farming, farm (providing the excess to the markets) people that want to be doctors become doctors, and people that enjoy teaching become teachers, people that just enjoy lively debate and philosophy become philosophers. People do what they want because they want to do it, not because they they're driven by a social impetus to hoard baubles. Children are allowed to grow, and experiment, and do as they please, because in this world, it's accepted that when they're ready they will "grow up" people are kind to each other, and everyone is equal; gay straight, black white, man woman. What I’m describing is not an Amish or Quaker type thing, because high-technology abounds. There is an internet, but it's only used for what its intended purpose was: spreading ideas, keeping in touch with friends and family, sharing media (artistic, not pr0n) and learning. I won't say robots because that implies they're self-aware, and in this age of enlightenment it's accepted on the grounds of sheer common sense that true AI must never happen, it simply has no useful application outside of areas of war, and in this world of course... there is no conflict. But serving machines will be commonplace when people go out to eat (at a restaurant built by a person who enjoys building, operated by people who enjoy cooking) their food will arrive at their table via serving robots. Robots will also be responsible for all manufacturing needs, because I don't think there's anyone who enjoys factory and assembly line work. There is no societal craving for betterbetterbetterfasterfasterfaster technology. When systems reach adequate levels no improvements are needed, so none are researched. If a stereo plays your music, why must it be "improved"? If computer and microprocessor technologies are strong enough to satisfy all computing needs why must they go ever faster and faster? Of course there will be improvements, they will simply stop when there's clearly no need for anything better. If a computer game has perfectly photorealistic graphics, and runs so well no one even thinks about frame rates or choppiness, what need for improvement? Instead improvements will come in the form of CONTENT. everyone will have all the tools they need to create things they want to create, artists will get physical art supplies, and art programs, etc. this is not to say that there will just be an incredible abundance of any kind of goods anyone could possibly want, what I’m saying is, there will be no DESIRE to accumulate more then you will use. In this world psychology is king, and the human brain is understood. Communal gatherings will be commonplace, and happen frequently. People will enjoy attending and look forward to these events, because in this world, there are no chronic shut-in's. Sure there are people who are perfectly normal and well-adjusted who just enjoy staying inside and reading a book as opposed to outdoor activities, but they won't be crotchety types. Anti-social hermits almost without fail, generally avoid contact with others because they hate the ignorance and intolerance of the masses... but those ignorant masses do not exist here, so there's no one to avoid. Unions between two people in this world are gentle affairs. Local customs would of course dictate certain small details, but in general if two people decided to commit to a monogamous relationship, they would tell each other quietly, by themselves in a secluded natural spot. The words would be heartfelt. And when the couple returned home they would have a party to celebrate their joy with friends and loved ones. There are no STD's in this world, and sex is almost a non-issue. People have it, or don't have it as they wish, it's a natural thing and no one thinks twice about it.
