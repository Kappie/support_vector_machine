This night was the annual game night where we play games with eachother--but my mentor and I just sat off to the side and discussed Moby Dick, my writing, and his writing.  It was cool.   I also got to catch up with Jessica, the girl I was crushin on for a little a couple months ago, but I realized she's not really girlfriend material for me.  She's in the Kaplan program too, so we talked a lot on the way over and before our mentor's came.  That's all for now, next entry is this funny ass story that Dan told me about his trip to this Science Conference in Seattle.  You thought I forgot to post it, didn't you Dan!!
