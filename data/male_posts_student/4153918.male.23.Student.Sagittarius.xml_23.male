On Sears hairdryer:   "Do not use while sleeping."  (But..., that's the only time one have to work on one's hair)    2. On a bar of Dial soap:  "Directions: Use like regular soap."  (And that would be how. . . ?)    3. On some Swanson frozen dinners:  "Serving suggestions: Defrost."  (But it's "just" a suggestion)    4. On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom of box):  "Do not turn upside down."  (Oops, too late!)    5. On Marks  Spencer Bread Pudding:  "Product will be hot after heating."  (Hmm . . . .)    6. On packaging for a Rowenta iron:  "Do not iron clothes on body."  (But wouldn't this save even more time?)    7. On Boot's Children's Cough Medicine:  "Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication."  (We could do a lot to reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head colds off those forklifts.)    8. On Nytol Sleep Aid:  "Warning: May cause drowsiness."  (One would hope)    9. On most brands of Christmas lights:  "For indoor or outdoor use only."  (As opposed to underwater?)    10. On a Japanese food processor:  "Not to be used for the other use."  (I gotta admit, I'm curious.)    11. On Sainsbury's peanuts:  "Warning: Contains nuts."  (NEWS FLASH)    12. On a child's Superman costume:  "Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly."  (I don't blame the company, I blame parents for this one.)    13. On a Swedish chain saw:  "Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands."  (Was there a chance of this happening somewhere? . . .Good grief!)   14. On a bottle of Palmolive Dishwashing liquid:  "Do not use on food."  (Hey, Mom, we're out of syrup! It's OK, honey, just grab the Palmolive!)
