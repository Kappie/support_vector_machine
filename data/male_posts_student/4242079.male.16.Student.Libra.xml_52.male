I made $20 selling some old computers to Matt from work. I think I may have ripped him off. I should offer to give him some of his money back.   At the moment, I'm not thinking that much. I haven't really had many thoughts the last few days. I've been so busy with work and Crystal. Today was the first day in a long time I've been able to just sit and do nothing for a while. Too bad it was freezing out today. I really miss my bike.    The thoughts are coming in fragments now, nothing's coherent anymore
