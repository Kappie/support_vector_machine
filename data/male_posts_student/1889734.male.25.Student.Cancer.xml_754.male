Of course, they say the execution is more like 'Pentagon tactics', and they are more upset about how this is distracting the Arab world from Abu Ghraib.  Did anyone notice that Bush slapped trade embargos on Syria last night for all non-food items in retaliation of thier support of terror and their interference in Iraq?  Hezbelloh is supported by Syria....hmmmmm....  Anyway, I thank Hezbelloh for this  shameless hypocrisy  principled denunciation.
