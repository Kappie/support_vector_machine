As it turns out, I am keeping the kitten, who is now officially named Marlena. [pronounced MAR-LAY-NUH  for those of you who do not know the song.] The day my dad found her was fun. Sean, Chloe, Angela, Andy, Austin, Alex, Lizz and I walked around the woodlands and posted "found kitten" signs...but that got boring so we ditched the signs and started "lizard hunting." That was pretty fun, Andy caught a very interesting lizard that was dark brownish and a little bit goldish, and he kept that for almost the entire time we were out. We caught a few of those little green ones too, and someone-not saying any names-accidentally let one of them loose in Chik-Fil-A!!!! That was crazy. After that, it started raining... Since then we haven't done much except eat popsicles, swim, play homerun derby [Congratulations to Andy who beat me yesterday :) *or maybe the day before.......*] OH and of course there was movie night at Anthony's house. REALLY fun, we watched the Count of Monte Cristo. Der Film war sehr spannend! Anyway, Jaci's been hanging out at my house almost every day-VERY fun, lol ABS and BEES! And today...today Lizz, Andy, and Sean woke me up! They were standing on my driveway throwing tennis balls at my window and talking very loudly. I just went back to sleep, though. ;) hehe. Oh, and I've been missing Justin because even though he's back from his cruise, I still haven't seen him yet! He's coming over on Thursday, though, so it's all good!!! Love you Justin! Ooooooooh and more good news-Timmy's moving back and coming to visit from Alaska next week!!!!!!!! Alex is coming up from Trinidad either tomorrow or Thursday, and THE SKOWS ARE COMING ON THURSDAY! Yay!!! Then I get to see Justin again on Saturday *huge smile* and my very cool cousin Sarah is coming to visit on Sunday, and she's staying for a week!! And after that, Sarah, Lizz, and I are going on a three-week vacation to Missouri and Arkansas-possibly Oklahoma-to visit family. I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      Ok so now that you've been filled in on everything going on here, leave a comment!
