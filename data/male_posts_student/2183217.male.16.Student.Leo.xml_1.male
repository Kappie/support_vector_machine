I made a minor change to the template that gives all of Stoney's posts a pink title and mine a blue one, so you know which ones will be funny (blue) and which ones will be messed up and uncomprehensible (pink). We're working on getting Stoney an Audiomatch.net image but her computer crashes every time she moves her mouse more than one pixel. Stay tuned.
