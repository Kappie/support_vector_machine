Just to piss him off and to tell him i mind, I caught him in midstare and let him off scampering. People like Jeffrey make my day. They make all the pains worth it. Its like i could bear even more, when i should have given up up way before. and i guess jeffrey feels the same way. his kidneys are shot dead. he's pleasantly plump 7 year old smiling face belies the fact that he might not see his 1st decade. and here you see him running around and sticking out his tongue at you just because he can. how sad. i would want to tell you, but i would not know how it would end. but endings for cases like these are always unpleasant. people like him make worth living. if he knew i wonder how he would take it. if he knew, i wonder if he would still be happy. but i thank jeffrey. for giving me hope. when i have none. ignorance is bliss, i wish i didnt know, so i would be happy. but i do. such is the price of knowledge. if ignorance is bliss, doctors must be the most unhappy people of the world
