Stewie : "You know Mother, life is like a box of chocolates [he presents herwith a box], you never know what you’re going to get, your life however is morelike a box of active grenades! [the box has grenades in it] Now I offer you onelast chance for deliverance- return my mind control device, or be destroyed." Lois : "Oh, you just want your toy back. Okay, here ya go honey." Stewie : "Yes, well, Victory is mine! [ Walks away with the device into thedining room. A crash sound is heard] Ahhhhhh! Damn you all!" See that? That is the best line in Family Guy, one of my favourite shows. Another is: Glen : "Hey, who wants to play “Drink the Beer”?" Peter : "Right here!" Glen : "Heh, you win!" Peter : "All right, what do I win?" Glen : "Another beer!" Peter : "Oh, I’m going for the high score." Glen : "Well, actually Charlie has the high score." Charlie : [with his pants down facing the inside of a grandfather clock] "Heyman, your clock won’t flush." HAHAHA! That is classic humour, in it's finely refined form. "Hey man, your clock won't flush."  Oh my god! Family Guy Rocks!
