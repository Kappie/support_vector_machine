I could go for another :P.   I changed the layout of the journal, as I personally thought the other one was a little too dark, this one is easier to read and a bit more "user" friendly.   I dreamt last night about that movie, A Day After Tomorrow. But that it actually happened in the world. It was a crazy dream, Thunder Bay had these fierce thunder storms and tornadoes during the WINTER. So it was cold, windy and really stormy. Fucked eh?  I work tonight at 4:00 PM, until 8:00 PM, like usual. I hope it's not busy tonight, thats all it has been recently. Calls after calls and the majority of them are about the same damn thing. You might as well ALL call at the same time and I'll fix everything for you. Ah, the customer service field - always fucking surprises me.  Well, thought I'd post some shit before I go and get ready and what not for the rest of the day. I will talk to you all later.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site    Our greatest battles are that with our own minds. - Jameson Frank
