Wow, this sounds really bad, but I must continue.  I have EE Bonds that I cash in to survive while I'm in school.  And they know if I come in at the beginning of the month that I'm there for that reason.  So I'm waiting to get into my deposit box and one of the ladies says hi to me from across the room.  And brilliant ole' me says loud enough for most of the bank (filled with women, mind you), "Yep, it's that time of the month!"  "Hmm..." I thought to myself, "that maybe sounded wrong out of context."  So I say back to her, "That didn't sound so good, did it?"  The whole bank of people just about roared with laughter, as did I.  I brought attention to my mistake, and brought smiles and laughs to over a dozen people this afternoon.  That's gotta be  some  kind of productivity for the day.
