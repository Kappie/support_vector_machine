And the Apocalypse (how do you spell the bloody thing?) is coming. Doom doom and more doom.  Dad says Damnit is spelled Dammit when only one word, and Damn It otherwise. Not anymore!  Alanna is so lovely. Our parents deserted us last night and ran to the Party in the Library, so she was willing to put up with me for a while so I wouldn't be lonely. I drove to her [Alanna's] house playing Stretch Princess, who is now moving up in the holy hierarchy, and we listened to Shoes. Which is a Muse in the form of sound waves. But Alanna joined me and, after my parents finally left for the Party of booze and loud music in the history section of the library, we argued about who was more indecisive over movies. So we ran to blockbuster (actually, not ran, drove rather, but who cares) and rented Frida.  Just a little thing about Frida: excellent acting, wonderful historical telling, superb color-enhancing and regulation. One problem: it's fucking creepy. Seriously, when she is painting the creepy stuff in her later life, it really frightens one. For example, the painting of her and herself attached through the neck by a vein. Or (this one really scared the shit out of me and I don't know why) the picture of her on top of a ziggeraut, with her metal brace-cage on her nude upper body, and her stone spinal column cracking, and her face full of  nails .    As I said, seriously disturbing.  Cheers.
