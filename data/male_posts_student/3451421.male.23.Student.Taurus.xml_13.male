This art, like any other, requires practice and expertise, niether of which I posses. However learning these tools, though aggrevating as all heaven, is a good skill to know. I feel that learninig these basic skills will open new doors for me as well as to help persuade me to like and use computers a little more. 2.	my website picture is http://www.albany.edu/~pm0115/pat's%20pic.bmp .
