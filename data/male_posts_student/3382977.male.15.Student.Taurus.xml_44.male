I always remember it being at least past noon...anyway, tomorrow im seeing Dodgeball at 1:10. So, after watching the movie today i went back to his house and played some games and then went to my violin lesson which started at 4 and then went home and then went to my YO rehearsal which started at 7, but i was 15 minutes late...but it didnt matter since i dont play the Piano concerto in A minor ( since im in the back ), so i had a good hour and a half to do stuff, so i got a bit to eat since i didnt have much time at home earlier...and cruised around Van Ness (i just remembered i should have brought my gift certificate for a book store near there). And i called the Waldenbooks hotline for gift cards and found a whopping 30 bucks on my card that thank god hasnt expired (since i live in CA). Anyway...thats just about it. I totally forgot about a rehearsal with a friend for his recital coming up and he got kinda pissed and decided to call it off, but im glad he did since im kinda busy with other stuff...or am i?...hmmm.
