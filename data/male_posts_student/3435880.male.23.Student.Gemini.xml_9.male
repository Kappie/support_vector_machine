"Hmmmm...." i thought. "that's odd" Apparently they can charge you for a course... and if you don't pay for it... they won't tell you where it is. Isn't that funny? Damn straight. I thought so too. I did manage to find a way around it.. they haven't blocked off all access yet.. I could still check my calendar and that has all the pertinent info in it.   And in light of my financial situation... (ie: I owe, but have nothing to give) I figured it was time to finally turn in my tax forms and get my refund.   WAIT! I know what you're thinking.. "Tax refund? But it's July... Tax season isn't till next spring...unless...." you pause, "...no... couldn't be... has this fool just be so surpassingly lazy as to have delayed simply asking for his money?" And I say...Yes... and no. I filled out the forms in March... and then I just kinda forgot. And then I didn't feel like bothering to do it. But regardless, it shall be done.. and I, Rhino the nearly graduated, shall pay my tuition no matter how it hurts... and I can tell ya... it hurts.  FnR
