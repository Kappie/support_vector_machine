Played some games with his bro for most of the day and went over to Macaroon's for an hour or so.  Played some games there with his bro.  It was pretty cool.  Then helped out the fam with some stuff.  Then just waited til people came over to par-tay.  Once they got here it was off the hook!  First, Macaroon, Amed, and Tyke did some filming of the three of them.  It was pretty funny.  Then Skippy joined them and they did another video.  It was one of them just sitting around and talking (Tyke was doing the filming though).  But it was great because they talked about the most random shit.  It was hilarious.  So they watched that.  Then they played Halo.  Then they got food at Mickey D's and they talked about not getting mad cow disease and stuff with the server guy.  Of course he was going all pro-McDonald's and "Ooooo, we don't have mad cow.  We have our own cows.  Mrah, there is chlorine in the water.  Mrah!"  Well that was cool.  Then they went to the Fred Meyer parking lot to play football of course.  Tyke videotaped them and he had to get some tape of Amed throwing cuz that is classic.  And then him dancing too.  Then they got in the car and they taped Amed dancing and singing to "I Like the Way You Moooooove."  That was funny.  Then they got home and Dr. Phil called em up and he came over later while they were playing more Halo.  So then they all got dressed up and did a little music video to "I Like the Way You Move."  It was very good and a little funny.  But really it was just a serious music video that with the right editing could win an award of some sort.  It is really classy stuff.  Nothing but the highest quality.  Deserving of a viewing to say the least.  Tomorrow (today) will hopefully be more of the same so this should be a blast!
