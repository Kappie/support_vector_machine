If you go back far enough, you can find plenty of Keynesian economists asserting that this trade-off also occurs in the long run."   -And a reasonably good case can be made for a negative tradeoff in the long run, if real money balances and consumption are complementary.  I happen to think that this is likely.   "Inflation turns ordinary working people into millionaires."   -Quadrillionaires if we're talking about lire.  Imagine how Republican the Turks must be!   "Democrats are opposed to inflation. Indeed."   -Only when Republicans are in power.  LBJ and Carter didn't seem to mind.   "Inflation hurts the poor...."   -How so?  I would think that an unanticipated bout of inflation reduces the real value of debt,  redistributing wealth from the rich to the poor.   "Inflation is anti-Communist. For several years now, one of the biggest buyers of US government bonds has been the Chinese central bank. No doubt, they think they’re buying leverage, but all they’re really going to get is pictures of Ronald Reagan. Heh."   -Sounds like fun.  Maybe throw in some pictures of Nixon.   "Inflation will destroy trust in government money and encourage the creation of private-sector alternatives."   -Give those gold-standard cranks something to do, I guess.   "Inflation is part of the American patriotic tradition...."   -And of the Russian, French, German, and Hungarian patriotic traditions too.  What better way would there be to reach out to our friends in Europe?  Sounds like a John Kerry campaign promise to me.
