Trust me, I'd rather be in your place and slog at school then rot here at home ( with a dripping sewer for a nose) and wonder wat sb mania would be like. . .  Just saw doctor b4 this, she said my throat inside   bloody swollen,    no wonder it hurt as hell to talk and i even thought at first that i got tonsillitis!Tried to take medicince and even swallowing the tablets also sooo uncomfortable. Will have to keep talking to a minimum and let throat heal or else cannot sell collar pin on sunday.   But nvm, on the  bright side  however . . . .:)  I got mc now!!! YAY! I can officially pon tml and go str8 to   SCGS   ! Although i cant play for sb mania ( cos its a physical activity and  will  be bad for me), i still can go to scgs (jus be a mute there and dun talk), and aint    NUHTHING'S    gonna stop me haha! ( except if the flu gets worse of cos). So nuria, manda and wai teng, see u guys tml!!!:) Have fun in gp;), this is the 2nd time in a row im missing a 2hr gp lesson. Sigh . . . life has its pros and cons heh?   P.S. Manda and Mindy, jiayou for sb mania k? I demand at least a silver from u guys here cos we cannot lose! N pls show mercy to the "lions" k? Taataa! Am gonna drool over cook books now to see all the delicious food i cannot eat, this is elsa's standard ways-to-occupy-your-time flu activity . . .
