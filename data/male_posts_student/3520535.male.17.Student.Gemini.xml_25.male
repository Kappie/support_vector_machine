Now here's the kicker, Robert said he'd like to do something over the weekend, since he wouldn't be able to spend much time with Michelle, but now she's good enough for him to no longer want to leave his house spending time with her and sitting at home watching porn and eating pizza. So, she's better just in time for my chance at lifting the boredom of the weekend to go byebye, but too late for the pool party. Reason two this weekend is shit: I'm working all goddam weekend, not a huge amount of hours but enough to ruin my chance of going to some protest with Noah tomorrow. And Zach's most likely gooing to get laid by some girl he doesn't even know that well tomorrow, and I have a fucking english assignment. The video I've borrowed from Mr. Eccleston for the english project was dropped by two people today (chelsea and james l.) and now has dented corners. A girl I was getting to know today gave me her phone number in my yearbook, but chelsea took off with that. Dammit. Shit, Piss and Mother Fucking Corruption! So, looking forward to a late project, a couple of exam reviews, and lots of work. Nice, isn't it? And all right before the last week of school. After which I get summerschool. Motherfuck.
