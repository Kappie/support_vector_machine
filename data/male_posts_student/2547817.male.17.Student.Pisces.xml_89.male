I entered the choir room and was greeted with many yells and screams and shouts. It was really pop star treatment. People running to gimme a hug and all. I was really happy. Haven't been that happy in a long while. Oh well, I really took time to look around me during my short visit there. Really appreciate the spacious, open, un-closed corridors and non air conditioned rooms. Pioneer SCHOOL! I loved it. I walked the choir out and everyone was just there and we did what we used to do. I loved it. I loved it! They loved me big time and I really missed them too! I loved it. Oh, I said that already...  On Tuesday, I started my PPCDL course. There's a lot to learn and a lot to pay and I'm really confused about a few concepts, but the knowledge I gain would sure be useful. Impressive too. I hope I make it through in the first try.  I had a dream about Zel. I dreamt that she went to Canada and fell in love with her teacher. And there was something about him... I think he was described as being like Paris, the fine man of wax. OK, I know Canada came from her wish to go back to Canada someday. We used to say that we'd get a small house out in the country with a big back yard where we'd keep 2 horses and 3 dogs. I think there were supposed to be sheep too. Falling in love definitely came from her recent infatuation with some other sec 4 boy, but WHERE THE HELL DID TEACHER COME FROM. I practically couldn't sleep, yet I did and thus my torture was prolonged. This is one recurring nightmare I don't wanna have. I want her back, but not now, I'll have to stick to my objective till the end of the year.  Shall sleep now. Eyes are closing. Lazy to do spellcheck but shall do it anyway for YOUR benefit. ok, Done. byE~
