It had a good idea, but bad presentation. there was really nothing to fear except for the evil frost, which in all reality is not that scary.  And there were these fake-ass wolves that really sucked ass.  I don't know, maybe you'll like it, maybe I just suck.  If you liked this movie, watch out for the sequel..."THE DAY AFTER THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW: LOOKS LIKE RAIN"  Quote of the Day:  "FUCK is a 4 letter word.  RAPE is a 4 letter word.  LOVE is a 4 letter word.  FUCK is a curse.  So is Love."                                             Augustus Hill  P.S.  I don;t believe that...love kicks ass, i just like the quote because it sounds cool and says FUCK a lot.
