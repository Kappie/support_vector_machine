Your body language changed Time’s drawing to a close I don’t want to be left Wondering why.  So what should I do When I’ve got nothing left To say to you? Should I turn my head Around instead of Saying goodbye? Or should I walk away? You left wondering why.  Your eyes don’t see me; Your ears don’t hear What I’m saying Or what I do. Wondering what to do Answers becoming clear. One thing’s for sure I’m not going to be fucking sitting here WONDERING WHY!!!!  So what should I do When I’ve got nothing left To say to you? Should I turn my head Around instead of Saying goodbye? Or should I walk away? You left wondering why.  I’LL TEAR YOUR INSIDES BEFORE I’M LEFT ASKING WHY,  IT’S NOT GOIN TO BE ME! NOT ME!!  NOT ME!!!! YOU!!!  So what should I do When I’ve got nothing left To say to you? Should I turn my head Around instead of Saying goodbye? Or should I walk away? You left wondering why.   here ends the love making session
