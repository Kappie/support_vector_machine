Ok, this whole thing about how much I get paid at work is finally starting to really seap in...it's not enough that I don't get paid enough compared with other people doing the same kind of thing that I am, but I don't get benefits, don't get bonuses, and don't get raises.  Yeah, I'm totally getting screwed, and the whole I-really-need-money-for-Washington thing only makes the bitterness all that much worse.  I was reading about the woman that will probably be taking over my job today...she was making about 2x's more than I am, she got yearly raises, she was in a profit-sharing program, and she got a yearly bonus.  Me = none of the above.  And she was in another relatively small business.  On the one hand, I try not to get angry - I agreed to be paid a certain amount for the work I did, and I always had the option of leaving (theoretically).  But on the other hand I've done a LOT for them - my position wasn't nearly as complicated when I got there, I've done a pretty good job at it, I do everything they ask me to (which is way outside of whatever vague job description I may have), and I basically headed the ISO program we implemented that will probably bring in a lot of money for the company.  So what do I get for ISO?  Dinner.  Anyway...like I said, I'm trying to not get angry about it or anything.  Things will turn out as they should, so there isn't really any point in gettin upset.  But I'm not bein too successful....every time I think I've got a grip on things something comes up that reminds how much I could use the extra money I think I've earned, and the whole emotional range of things starts all over again...
