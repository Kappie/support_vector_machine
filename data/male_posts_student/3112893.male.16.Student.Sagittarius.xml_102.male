I don't like it being so low and I think I'll start working on my tenor singing. If you're all lucky, you might even get to hear me if I ever work up the courage to sing into a phone. Last time I did that, Shannon (ex-girlfriend) asked me to and I was in that stupid early-teen love. Ugh. Just thinking about it, makes me depressed at how degenerate I was. Ewwww!!  Anyway, getting back to audioblogger making me sad, my cousin and I did a Guess The Song III but with a song that requires 4 guitars. Of course we only did the two most-main ones though. Here's a hint for what the song is: It was used in a few Nissan TV ad. I have nothing more to say, that I can think of now -- oh, right, if you see two audioposts without text attached to them, they weren't really checked and they're kinda messed up, but the main idea comes across. We did it a few times with different distances from the phone and my phone was dying so we couldn't check it back, so we don't know which is the good one yet. Good luck >_  That is all.     -- Feanor
