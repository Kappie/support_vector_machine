One day a gopher took the turnip and some cracker yelled "Ahhhhhhh, The Turnip is Missing"  That cracka sunnovabitch went looking for the missing turnip, but he didn't know that the gopher left some of the turnips seeds so a new one grew and the missing turnip turned up.  by,  General Tim and Grand Masta Brad  The Missing Turnip II  Once upon a time, there was a turnip.  It was missing because a bird ate it, but the bird pooped out the seeds and a new one grew so the missing turnip turned up.  General Frye and Grand Masta Brad   The Missing Turnip pt. 3  Once there was a turnip and a sumo wrestler sat on it and the turnip disappeared into his crack.  Then the fat guy farted and the turnip shot out and hit a 65 year old man in the face.  The turnip went right down the dudes throat and out his asshole so the missing turnip turned up.
