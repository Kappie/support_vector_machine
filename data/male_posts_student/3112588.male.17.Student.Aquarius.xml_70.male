LoL! so yeah...i watched the music video for the Yellowcard song "Only One"...no lie, its like my new favorite song! i love it to death. my parents are going away on saturday morning until sunday night, and im gonna chill by myself unless someone comes over. i think that suzy is coming over to help me paint during the day, but other than that--i need someone! AHH!! but yeah...i think im in love? LoL.....anywayz--here are the lyrics:    Yellowcard: My Only One     Broken this fragile thing now  And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces  And I've thrown my words all around  But I can't, I can't give you a reason   I feel so broken up (so broken up)  And I give up (I give up)  I just want to tell you so you know   Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you  You are my only one  I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do  You are my only, my only one   Made my mistakes, let you down  And I can't, I can't hold on for too long  Ran my whole life in the ground  And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone   And something's breaking up (breaking up)  I feel like giving up (like giving up)  I won't walk out until you know   Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you  You are my only one  I let go, there's just no one who gets me like you do  You are my only my only one   Here I go so dishonestly  Leave a note for you my only one  And I know you can see right through me  So let me go and you will find someone   Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you  You are my only one  I let go, there's just no one, no one like you  You are my only, my only one  My only one  My only one  My only one  You are my only, my only one
