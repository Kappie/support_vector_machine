Ok now that i got that out of the way  Ten years ago today kurt cobain killed himself. even though the man had some seroious issues (and i think i was 7 at the time), i would just like to thank him for starting the grunge revolution, which gradually changed music into what it is right now. with out him, wed still be listening to some 80's rock band with the huge hair and glasses, and disgusting tight leather outfits. RIP cobain, you're a good man for what you did  adios amigos please, write some commentary on the types of women you love, or leave a little love on the cobain topic, you'll be a better person for it
