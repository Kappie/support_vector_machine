Jim the guy in the boat beside us had a sewing machine, and some older lady whose name I did not catch who used to be a seamstress got our sail back into shape.  This all happened while i walked all over downtown Freeport looking for some spare gas filters for our trip.  Didn't find any but i got to walk 6 miles in the sun and almost adopted a cat from the humane society.  We spent the rest of the day hanging with Jim and Debbie the lady on the boat beside us who is also stuck here with her own boat problems.  She is actually from Atlanta too and has a bed and breakfast in inman park, I think its called Sweet Magnolia's.  We ended up spending 3 nights here total and now we're off to our deserted island again. Maybe we'll make it this time.  Blue Sky over and out.
