Apparently, they had a limited number of positions this year and they used a lottery to determine who they would hire.  Last year I wasn't on their list either, but they called me a week or two late anyway because someone backed out.  Other kids were called late as well.  So maybe that will happen again this year--but I think it's set in stone this year.  So that upset me a lot for two reasons.  Reason A, which is the most important of the two, is that that job was an activity for me to occupy and enrich myself with throughout the summer--in opposition to sitting at home and rotting.  Reason B is that I was going to gather up all my checks and purchase an iBook in August.  I spoke to my mom about the iBook and she told me I didn't have to worry about it--she would get it for me with my dad.  But the former reason for getting the job was much more important and when I got that news I was very very angry.  And I was also embarassed because people ask you what you're doing this summer and you say working and then you end up not working.  It's also embarassing because everyone's got at least one thing to do this summer.  Me?  Nothing.  There's no trip, no job, no anything.  People who aren't working or going to camp that I know are at least going away for a week or two at some point this summer.  I was talking to Emily yesterday, or the day before that, I've lost track, and she said that her mother might have a job for me and that she'd ask her.  I really hope that works out because that could be a solution to a few of the problems and the general funk I've been in since the beginning of this summer.    Another problem that I have is that I miss people who have gone away until August.  One of these people is Rachel, who I must have talked to every day since March or February for hours on end.  That leaves a big hole in your day and in your social existence.  But it's not too bad, we talk on the phone pretty often and I wrote her and Stephanie a letter the other day.  It just sort of leaves you in a shitty mood though because you miss those people.  A third problem that I'm dealing with is my fucking god awful laziness.  I know I'm going to come out of it any day now but it's just terrible, and you beat yourself up because you know you're not getting anything done.  I haven't been excercising, I haven't been  writing --and that really bothers me because I am really big on my writing and I hate that I haven't been working harder on it, I haven't been working on any graphics--I have a wallpaper in the works that has been sitting in a folder on my desktop for weeks now, and I haven't started thinking about building my website yet either.  Now, let's think about this.  Why haven't I been getting those things done?  Well the answer is that I'm in such a shitty mood all the time that I don't even feel like getting up and getting any of those things done.  This problem is an extension of my other issues.    Here's a background issue.  I want a girlfriend.  I want some love, some affection, some contact.  I need some sort of a real bond with a girl.  It's a fulfilling experience and I feel like I really need it.  That's an embarassing thing to say but I know that virtually everyone my age is looking for that, so whatever, I was the one to say it.  And I just don't FUCKING know what I want.  I have no idea at all.  I've got a current fixation but all I see it ending up in is disappointment.  But I'm less worried about this shit because frankly I'm tired of thinking about it.  I really don't feel like giving a shit anymore and I don't think I will.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  I'm tired of trying to figure girls out.    So there it all is.  Today I woke up at 3:00 pm.  It's 11:30 pm as I type this sentence.  I'm wired.  I'm sitting in the dark with a candle lit and I think I'm going to force myself to fall asleep.  It's not all as bad as it sounds.  I'm not a wreck, I'm not fucking up, I just feel shitty, that's all.  I'm not going to allow comments on this entry because although I want to talk to people and I want people to say the right things, no one will--or at least I won't like what people have to say.
