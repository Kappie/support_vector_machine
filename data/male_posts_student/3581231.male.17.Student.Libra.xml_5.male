"its a place where we'll spend the rest of our lives."  no you won't.  no you   fucking won't  .  its all going to be a cob job, not well thought out, and everyone is going to be pissed in the end.  especially me.  "you only have another year at home, so your opinion doesn't count."  how about this opinion:  jump up your ass and poke your head through your neck.  or this:  take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut.  or this:  fuck off.    if you can't tell, i get pissed everytime the subject comes up.  this is going to be an uphill battle for them, from me.  it won't be pleasant for anyone involved....
