Religion of Peace and all that...  In a related story, I purchased a copy of the Koran on Saturday.  I also purchased a book on the Waffen SS in WWII, so between the two books, I probably went on someone's watch list.  I started the Koran and I'll be sure to make reports back, if anyone is interested.  So far, the second Surah (The Cow) spends a lot of time dwelling on the Muslim duty to kill those that oppose them, and explains how Allah has fosaken the unbeliever.  In context, this Surah was released by Mohhamed at the same time he was at war with the Pagan Arabs at Mecca, and had just been sold up the river by Jewish allies.  Those muslims have long memories if they still hold the Jews accountable for a 1400 year old argument.  [2.6] Surely those who disbelieve, it being alike to them whether you warn them, or do not warn them, will not believe. [2.7] Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing and there is a covering over their eyes, and there is a great punishment for them. [2.8] And there are some people who say: We believe in Allah and the last day; and they are not at all believers. [2.9] They desire to deceive Allah and those who believe, and they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive. [2.10] There is a disease in their hearts, so Allah added to their disease and they shall have a painful chastisement because they lied. [2.11] And when it is said to them, Do not make mischief in the land, they say: We are but peace-makers. [2.12] Now surely they themselves are the mischief makers, but they do not perceive. [2.13] And when it is said to them: Believe as the people believe they say: Shall we believe as the fools believe? Now surely they themselves are the fools, but they do not know. [2.14] And when they meet those who believe, they say: We believe; and when they are alone with their Shaitans, they say: Surely we are with you, we were only mocking. [2.15] Allah shall pay them back their mockery, and He leaves them alone in their inordinacy, blindly wandering on.
