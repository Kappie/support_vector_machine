     
      a knife.  an assassin.  a snake.  a filthy, guiltless creature that hides in the covers as a friend while you watch him with both your eyes.   a great preteder that blinds you from the pressing truth.  silent as the calm air. smooth as the flow of placid water. he makes his move among the sea of turned backs.  a traitor he is. leading you on and on.  beware.  i shall have my revenge.  you crossed the line.
