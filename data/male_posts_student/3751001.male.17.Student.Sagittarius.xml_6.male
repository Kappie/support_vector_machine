Anyway as you know I dropped out of my college course and i've finally sorted out an interview for next year, I intend to do graphic design but you shouldn't worry as they will be plenty of fresh updates next year.  Currently listening to :: Metallica - Four Horsemen  Currently in production :: Nothing, cuz i'm a lazy bugger :D :P
