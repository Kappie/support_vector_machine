I'm at work until 6pm, I go do whatever other errands I need to do, eat some dinner, and I'm back by 7-7:30 pm. Then, there's still work to be done. Household chores, or some essay that someone wants me to write, or some bank thing, or something... which leaves me 2 hours of fun per day, unless I want to concoct an amphetamine cocktail so I don't have to sleep. I'm not sure if that will even work. Hm.  I'm pretty sure summer didn't used to be like this. In fact, there were prolonged periods of boredom/intense game playing/book reading that went on in previous summers. This is ca-wazy! I sure hope the school year is better *grins* Fat chance o'that!  It's not SO bad, I guess. I'm just not used to it, and it'll probably stay this way for most of my life. I still manage to get out on the town a couple of times weekly, either with my bone thug Brian (and Co.) or my diggity dawg David, or with the charming miss Guinevere, all of whom rock mightily (in glorious Technicolor!)  By the way,  urlLink life is good!!!
