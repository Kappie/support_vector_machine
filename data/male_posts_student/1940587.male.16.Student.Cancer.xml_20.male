The extent of non busyness plus the fact that I was put on A REALLLY FRIKIN non busy till pissed me off. To top that off I made a friend. I made a Mistake. Now that Friend hates me:P.. o wow what a cycle. Something I did cuz I was bored but hey should've known better but no. O well.  No grudge just wish I didn't do it. I finally got my first paycheck last thursday:)...:).. I was happy. Well, I'm going to call it a night. I've got TONZ of work to do 2morrow so ttfn  ColdAsFire ... Aka... ACZ
