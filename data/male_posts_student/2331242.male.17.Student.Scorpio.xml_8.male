See if you can name them!*  Christmas has officially arrived here on the east coast, but I'm feeling pretty... ugh.... right now. Let me explain.   Get up, come on get down with the sickness.  These few days leading up to Christmas have been quite painful for me. Ok, so after I got my car fixed and inspected, my dad took me to this restaurant called Greystone. I had been there once before and the food was mediocre at best. I remembered only one thing about the place: it takes forever and a day to get your food. The same was true for this visit, but I never expected to get  food poisoning . Not the vomiting type, but the type that will sap your energy for days and make every waking moment a painful one. Medicine hasn't really helped. In desparation, I tried some methods to ...ehem.... "clean out the system." So far, not working. I'd better heal up fast because...   Whoa, Mexico  Yup, I'm going to Guadalajara to meet Martha's family! Hooray! So, this whole crazy plan basically developed on our ROTK date. We were eating lunch when, through a mouth full of roast beef, I mentioned how unenthusiastic I was about this Christmas holiday. I explained to Martha how I was basically just going to play on the computer until my eyeballs exploded, and how bored I would become. She proposed that I come with her to Mexico for Christmas. "Yeah... I wish" was my original response, but luckily, she persisted. After several long battles with my parents, I forked over 300 bucks to pay half of the plane ticket and my one and only Christmas present: a one week trip to Mexico. Thank you priceline.com. Thank you mom and dad. Thank you Martha. Now I'm kinda their slave though... I have to practice in excess of an hour a day, read my English book, and do their bidding wherever they need me before I go. It's worth it. Oh yeah, and I  finally  got Martha a Christmas present. ^_^ I hope she likes it, but no Christmas present can do that girl justice for how she's brightened my life. Even worse, this week is "hands-off." Don't want to get caught by the father who's hosting me and paying for my meals o_0   I guess I'm a criminal.  So that hit and run thing never blew up in my face like I feared it would. I still have no remorse. I dunno though... I think my car and I can see the future. Check it out. Each of the two times I have had an accident, I have dreamed about it the night before. The first one, I envisioned myself running a red light on a rainy day and almost hitting something. After that, I tried to park my car on a lake, but it wouldn't float. I told myself, "silly JD, you can't drive a car on water." The next day, I was following my friends to a Chinese restaurant and tried to speed through a yellow light. Not realizing that my friend infront of me hadn't gone through the yellow, I had just enough time to hit the brakes. It would have worked, except for the fact that it was pouring rain. This last time, I had a dream that I was up on a mountain, with a steep gravel road and cars parked all around. I was backing out and put on the breaks, but the car just kept sliding, right into another parked car. That night I had my second accident. The similarities are just plain creepy.   American Money  In the past, I haven't been big into the "giving" part of Christmas. I'd pick out a present for my dad, and my mom would pay for it. I'd pick out a present for my mom, and my dad would pay for it. One of them would pay for the present for my aunt or grandparents, and that would be it. Then, I'd watch as they blew even more money on my Christmas wishlist. Not this year. This year, I spent my  own  money on Christmas gifts. I took time out of my day to shop for them, and I made sure that each one was quality. Together, my brother and I spent over 180 bucks on presents, and believe it or not, I actually felt better afterwards.  READERS: Only 180 bucks?!  JD: Don't get me started, rich boy.   I'm in love. I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried.  A week basically alone with Martha. Hands-off or not, I'm still gonna enjoy her company. It's better than just making a depression in my chair while Epsilonia (who is now a capable level 13) gets his ass kicked by goblins and my mom screams at me for being a lazy teenage bum. Hehe. 28 hours from now (yes, 4:00 in the morning. Damn terrorists.) I'll be arriving at Charlotte Douglas International. It'll be the first time I've flown alone, but I think I can handle it.  Feliz navidad, everyone. Now if you'll excuse me my stomach isn't very happy with me right now...  Luv ya Martha
