For those of you who don't know (and i wouldn't blame you if you didn't, seeing as the show sucks), It's a show on the Fox netowrk where two families trade mothers or fathers. Dave Chapelle made fun of the idea before it even happened on his "The Chapelle Show". I think his randition of the show was better. Back to the matter at hand, Trading Spouses is the biggest load of tripe that any scottsman could swallow. Period. Wow, I just now realized how much this was more of a movie review than a blog. oh well.   -Jim
