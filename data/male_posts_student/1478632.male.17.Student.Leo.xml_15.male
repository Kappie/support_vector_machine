I'm on tongiht to update all my stuff and check my email, maybe even talk to my estranged friends (estranged = disconnected from me). I haven't  talked to my friend Jeremy since school let out...maybe I should email him...later... I'm starting to wish I had a computer at this point, because I've been out of the loop, and all of my friends have gone out and done stuff without me even knowing! *Sighs* That, and NS 2.0 comes out in about 9 days...but who's counting? Work (I should tell you about it huh) ...work is starting to be...uhh...traumatizing. The little girl (I told y'all about her) thinks that I'm her boyfriend now, and tells all her friends so. Why can't I get the girls I actually want? This confuses me severely. *Sighs again* With nothing really to tell you other than that, I'm off to check on my friend's blogs.  G'Night y'all.  --Clash
