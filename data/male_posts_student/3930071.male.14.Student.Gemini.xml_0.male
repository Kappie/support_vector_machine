The Dolphins do not currently have a quality runningback or quarterback, leaving us with what options to score touchdowns. The lack of a runningback will just put our mediocre quarterbacks under more pressure. I am usually very optimistic about Miami teams but this team is hard to be excited about. I think they will have to get moving if they want to pull of a WINNING season, let alone a playoff season. Unless A.J. Feeley develops into a great quarterback and Travis Minor has a breakout season (which in fact I believe he can) the Dolphins are not looking very good. Ricky Williams says the Dolphins will be better off without him. I sure hope that is true, but frankly I dont care what that guy thinks. I have lost all respect for Ricky Williams. I do agree he has the right to do whatever he wants with his life, even if that means retiring from football. What I do not agree with is that he did it this late in the offseason when we have no time to make any big moves, and right after Eddie George signed with Dallas. That was wrong on his part he messed everything up. I would like to hear your comments on how you think the Dolphins will do next season, and on the Ricky Williams ordeal. See Ya, Carlos
