We did all the audio editing ourselves, lights were done by the infamous Porembka (hate to use a name on the internet, but this one deserves a shout-out), and the crowd noises are all real :P we honestly did get a reaction that big.  BTW, I'm the one playing Umbrella, guitar, and Kurt Cobain.   urlLink Clicky clicky   On an entirely different note: everything seems more bizarre and beautiful everyday.  P.S.: We own fine arts
