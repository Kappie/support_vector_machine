This particular man is the complete opposite of me. While I am tall and lean, he is short and fat. While I am agnostic, he's a complete right wing extremist christian. Just about the only thing we have in common is that we both have tremendous egos. Ego to spare. The difference here is that I have mine repressed and under control. For someone, like this person, to have a ego the size of Texas, is simply ridiculous. He's pretty smart- no brainiac, but he knows what he says. Unfortunately, everything he says comes off Mount Sinai graven on stone tablets. I suppose I can't blame him.... He sees the world how we wants it to be, not how it is. For example: If someone unknowingly wears pink sunglasses, then everything is going to be tinted pink. If someone tells him an object is blue, then it's not really blue, is it? It's pink. At least, from his perspective, the object is pink. That is how this person sees the world. As I have said before, I can't fault him. That's our main difference- I try with all my might to see the world as objectively and unbiased as possible. I don't pretend that I am unbiased, but I try so hard. He THINKS he is unbiased, but he's just got those blinders on. How is he supposed to know?
