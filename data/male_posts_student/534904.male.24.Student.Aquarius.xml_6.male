Playing videogames is also good wholesome fun. Especially Sega games. Apparently. so are women.. but the ones I go for tend to be rather painful. Which sucks. But you get that.  And now, time to magically write a piece for tommorow's class, a 3,000-word History essay, and figure out just what the fuck happened to the first page of the 2nd Trumpet part for the ASO thang...
