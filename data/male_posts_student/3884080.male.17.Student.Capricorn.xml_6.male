But the money went to a good cause, first i got a full tank of gas, then i went to the mall and bought my warped tour ticket, it was $34.00 even. After that i went and bought some shorts, yes i know what your all thinking, "Adam doesnt wear shorts! Why did he buy some?!" well i will tell you why i bought some. im not going to be walking around warped tour all day in jeans. so i bought some long dickies black shorts. so its all good.  Now im really bored. everybody works today, and doesnt get done until later. so now im watching King Of The Hill. Yeah this post is pretty un-exciting so im going to go. sorry to bore all of you but i just thought i would post to pass the time.  "I dont know why, but didnt ask questions because it was the first time in my life, yeah the first time in my life, where i did something right. I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time"
