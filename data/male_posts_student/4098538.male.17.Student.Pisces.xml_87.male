Things are always harder than they seem with me. I still want to eat them but I fear they will start pouring from my nose.  So today, I 'started' to redecorate my room. I've done next to nothing. I grabbed some tile grout and started filling in all of the massive holes in my wall. I plan to put up some plan white wallpaper and to paint it whatever colour I choose. I also wanna do something with my floor... either varnish the floorboards underneath my carpet or try to find a new one which I actually like (as the one I have now is appauling)...
