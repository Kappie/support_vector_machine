Of the three permanent members that opposed the war, Russia and France both had multibillion dollar trade with the Hussein regime, and China is redder than a maraschino cherry. I don't really give a damn what the French think of the war, and anyone who does needs to realize that the last time the French needed more proof of a threat, it marched into Paris under a German flag, and should also realize that the French are socialistic morons.  So, with the French and Germans bent upon our failure in Iraq, several members of the American left decided to try and stop the war by protesting, and Bush-bashing. Their slogan became, under Michael Moore and others, that our brave men and women had died for nothing. After the WMD intelligence, which had been previously supported by France, Russia, Germany, and the U.N. proved to be 'false,'* the left vamped up their Bush-bashing and their slogan became, "Bush lied, soldiers died...for nothing, for a lie."  The left claims they do this to support the soldiers, but does that make sense? To support the soldiers, but not their cause is tantamout to supporting the Gay Rights Organization, but not supporting gay rights.  Suppose you are in Iraq, serving your country. Every day on the news, you see Michael Moore, Al Franken, and others saying, "Our soldiers are fighting and dying for no reason. They don't need to be over there." Doesn't that minimize your efforts as a soldier?  The fact is, whether the left admits it or not, our brave soldiers overthrew a dictator and liberated a nation. But you won't hear the left say, "Thank you, soldiers, for overthrowing an evil man." And when I say that, the left says, "But that's not the reason they were given."  But you know what? I'm a firm believer in giving these men and women hope, appreciation, and love. The left is giving them none of that. The left is giving them a feeling that they are dying for no reason, that no one appreciates what they've done in Iraq.  Take the example of Lila Limpscomb, the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq, who is featured in Michael Moore's latest, 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' It seems Ms. Limpscomb initially supported the war and the President, but then recieved word that her son had died, shortly before receiving a letter from her son criticizing President Bush and the war effort. Can you blame him? Everyday he hears that he's basically accomplished nothing in Iraq.  Lila takes this very hard. But Michael Moore is there to manipulate the greiving Ms. Lipscomb into promoting his leftist cause. He could have said, "Lila, I appreciate your son's service. He died honorably and courageously. He answered his country's call, and he helped to remove a brutal dictator." If my brother was killed in Iraq, I would take comfort from that more than Mr. Moore's message of choice, paraphrased. "Yes, Lila, your son died for nothing. He died for a lie, he died to secure oil for corporate fatcats. You only have one way to help his memory...to join the Antiwar effort."  In short, ladies and gentlemen: You can't support our troops by destroying the glory in what they've done, and invalidating the sacrifices they've made in our country's name. If the leftists truly cared about our men and women in uniform, they would put aside political bickering**, which gets nobody anywhere, and support our troops. The bad intelligence is behind us, there's nothing we can do to change that. What we can do is support our troops and glorify their cause. They deserve as much.  *False intelligence? I've got news for you, people. Until we wanted to go to war, NO ONE doubted this intell was false. John Kerry called himself one of the biggest supporters of regime change in Iraq. France, and the rest of the UN 'reprimanded' Saddam frequently for breaking resolution 1441 and producing WMDs. Basically, we let Saddam go totally unchecked for about 3 months while the UN decided to move Weapons Inspectors into Iraq. If you were Saddam, and you knew that Bush would invade the hell out of you if you had weapons, and you had 3 months without anyone watching you (or your Syrian border), What would you do?  **I hate it when I hear people say, "I'll vote for Kerry to spite/remove Bush." It doesn't make sense. Kerry's  foreign policy, until he says otherwise, is exactly the same as President Bush's, minus a few vague remarks about making the US more trustworthy in the world. (This trust will last until the French don't want to deal with a threat, and instead would like to sit around, smoke, and let their armpit hair grow.) Kerry, Bush, and even Nader have all said they would leave the troops in Iraq. So why the hell vote for Kerry?
