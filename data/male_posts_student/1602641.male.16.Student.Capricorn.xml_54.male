Every time I turn on MTV or VH1(I don't too often) I see Britney Spears singing about how she's sick of the media, or Jennifer Lopez with her "Jenny from The Block" music video filmed from the perspective of a voyeur. It's going to happen. It's in the job description. Deal with it. You frickin' babies.
