In fact, maybe now the word 'blog' can rightfully be applied to what I write on the internet. Though still an exhibitionist phenomenon, this is an excellent opportunity to explore slightly more significant thoughts, findings, and ideas.    With that in mind, I'll inaugurate the whole thing with a blogging clich√©; commenting on a New York Times piece. Nicholas Kristof just wrote up a column about the disturbing "Left Behind" series of Christian Fundamentalist novels. In the most recent, Jesus returns to earth to brutally slaughter all the heathens (non-Christians), leaving the world only to his followers. It's a murderfest that evokesfrustration of the media's portrayal of Muslim Fundamentalism as violent and the Christian equivalent as somehow pure, but I digress. urlLink Read thecolumn for yourself if you're registered at the Times' site.    There is one other bit I want to throw out there before calling it an eDay. There is a reason I've decided to entitle this blog "Either-Or" and it's not merelyfor the purpose of literary or musical reference. As an atheist and an anti-fatalist, I and many others see the world as a huge conundrum that is being worked out constantly by a combination of random chance and distinct choices. Also speaking as a young person in a country so reputed for freedom and liberty, there are some massive choices that are on my own personal horizon. While trying not to overdramatize or overstate the gravity of my day-to-day life (and also avoiding the boring nature of such a topic), one goal I've got here is to present these choices and the consequential effects. It should be an interesting time, hopefully for any readers as well.
