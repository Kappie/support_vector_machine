I couldn't think of a titlebut Isaw my ferretrunby and seeing how that's a totally random little creaturehe seemed worthy of beingthe title of mypost.        I went to Gannon's yesterday and saw a bootlegged addition of Anchor Man (is that supposed to be two words? Oh well) It was really funny. We explored all his little barns and stuffthat are for some reason scattered throughout hisbackyard. I got trapped in a little house and like 5 wasps buzzed around in my face whenI tried to open a door...miraculously I wasn't stung but they blocked my window anddoor escape routs so I found another window andclimbed right into a thorn bush to get out. He also burned Secret Window buteither my@%$#! upPS2 and DVD player or his @%$#! up disc wouldn't work.ANGER!! By the way, whoever you are, you should buy that movie cuz it's really good.        Our(people from spanish) Spanish Day is tomorrow and that should be fun. Holy crap I just saw a transfer truck (well...a really big truck of some sort) back into a driveway across the street...that's gotta be hard.        Ze band name (if my opinion on best-thought-of-thus-far band namesmakes the final decision) is Gone Astray.I chose this cuz it sounds cool, it's catchy, and it could have alot of different meanings. Ithought about itand Brandonmay have amore minimalrole in theband than I was thinking. Of course we'llprobably have a long uncalled for arguement on the subject that will hurt relations but Ibelieve it's for the bestso that's the call.        Well that's about all for now so...see ya later.
