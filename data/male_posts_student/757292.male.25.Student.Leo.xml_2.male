Both sides of my stomach, shoulder blades, the right bicept, my thighs and parts of my legs are all sore as heck. Was it worth it? Not really, but we finished in second place and got medals, so that was amusing. My co-worker Matt kept everyone entertained with his slightly offensive sense of humour, but it was amusing nonetheless.  When I arrived home it was super nice to find some birthday greetings by some really great people. Thumbs up to that.
