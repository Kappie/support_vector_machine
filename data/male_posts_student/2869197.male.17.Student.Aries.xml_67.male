The first attempted a self-humiliation joke that just didn't fly. The second, one of my lab teachers, tried some "interactive study tools" which involved us shouting out that we were not asleep. They both ran out of time and did not finish their whole lecture. This surprises me. Debate basically revolves around the idea of saying all you need in a set period of time. You'd figure they'd be trained for this.  Researching is a boring task indeed. As in all boring tasks, my mind wanders and the Internet has many attractions to engage a wandering mind such as I. But now I feel guilty for not working enough. I wish we'd start researching a kritik. All the evidence is probably in books and philosophical disertation is sweet desert to my soul.  I've received directions to the Starbucks. I'd go now, but I just ate supper. Maybe later tonight. Still don't know if there is a BNN nearby. I hope so.
