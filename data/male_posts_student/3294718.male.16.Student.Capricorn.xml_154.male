I'm pretty sure that it is Saturday, and here is a recap of what I have been up too:  On Thursday I got off work and just shuffled around for a few hours because Chris had to work. Later on in the night I went over to John's house and loaded some new stuff into Beatbox. Yesterday, I went over to the Oselands place in the morning and went swimming. Me and Chris later met Hobe, Bryce, and Irene and went to  Anchorman . It was kind of funny, but I wasn't expecting much from it. The best part was when Jack Black dropkicked a dog off a bridge. Later on me and the Oselands went over to Bryce's house, where a bunch of people were sitting around, and proceeded to sit around all night, listening to 2nd wave ska and discussing politics and friendship. A couple of times it came to blows between me and Chris, and one time I ran down a hall to flying tackle Bryce, but he tripped me and I went flying into a door, which hurt.  We woke up this morning, feeling tired and irritable due to the late night, and went back to the Oselands. Erik made us pancakes, we sat around for a couple hours more, and I went home. I've had a bad headache all day, and it feels like I have a fever. Tomorrow I guess I will do something more interesting, after I have had some sleep.   About Fable: who cares? It is only a video game. The reason it everyone thinks it will be so great is that it has been hyped endlessly by Microsoft, and whether people realize it, the enthusiasm behind it is mainly because Microsoft-funded magazines have given it rave reviews. If it is good, cool. If not, cool. Either way it isn't worth spending hours talking about it. I have a Gamecube, and I never play it, and my PS2 is used only for playing DVDs.   Some entertainment-related interjections:  Bands I am looking forward to seeing at Warped Tour: Flogging Molly Anti-Flag Bouncing Souls Bad Religion (!!!) NOFX Tiger Army Lars Frederickson and the Bastards The Vandals  Rise Against The Casualties (God, I hope they play Made in NYC) The Briggs Big D and the Kids Table Somerset Letter Kills Duane Peters and Die Hunns Sadly, I do not think that I will be able to see all these bands in one day. Not only do I have to watch all of them, I have to visit all the awesome booths, which are at least 25% of the reason I go. But I will see some of them for sure (Bad Religion, the Souls, Anti-Flag, the Casualties, Duane Peters). I might have to skip some in order to see at least one band at each of the nine stages. Yeah, no doubt we will all splinter apart when we get there in order to pursue our own interests. We all want to see different bands, although we'll probably get together to meet some of our heros (Greg Graffin!!!!!!!). I want to check out the political action booths, and go shopping in addition to seeing the abovementioned bands, Chris will want to go check out the ska bands, Erik will want to go see Atmosphere and chase skirts, etc. So far these people are planning on going: Me  Chris Erik Mike  Speedy (Mike's Brother) Alex  Bryce Nate Joe John, mom's permission pending.   Seriously, it isn't bad or dangerous or anything. I know that it has changed to cater to screamo and pop-punks in recent years, but it still has plenty to offer for the True Believers. It is like a Woodstock for punks, a place where you can see all of your heroes in one day. This year, there will be so much to do that I am afraid that I will miss something. During the day,we will be checking out our favorites, shopping, meeting the bands, collecting free stuff, heckling sellouts, and seeing the little known and local bands.  I just finished reading this book called  Scary Monsters and Super Freaks , by Mike Sager. It is this collection of stories that have been printed over the years in magazines like  Rolling Stone  and  GQ . I recommend it to any pop-culture fan, as it has some excellent stories in it. After that, I moved on to a book called  The Clandestine Diary of an Ordinary Iraqi , by Salam Pax, the most famous blogger in history. His accounts of daily life in Iraq are interesting, and easy to understand, if you're into that.  I picked up Audio Karate's  Lady Melody  in the Gallery the other day for five bucks, but I haven't listened to it yet. Chris got a bunch of old ska CDs for nine bucks, and they are actually pretty good, especially if you are into stuff like the Specials, the Clash, and Op Ivy. While in the Gallery, this music-hipster dude was trying to impress the girls at the desk with his music knowledge, and me and Chris started mocking him when he started talking about Sleater-Kinney. He didn't really realize we were doing it, so intensely was he concentrated on getting the girl's phone number (the one that likes the Beastie Boys), but after a while we started talking about vinyl with him and decided he wasn't such a bad guy, even if he looked like he belonged on  the O.C.   We haven't all did something together for a while. Tomorrow, we should go get a pizza or something.   In other news, my dad started selling those little pocket bike motorcycles and now hundreds of strangers flock to my house every night to buy them. My dad is a pretty savvy businessman, something I fear I am hopelessly lost in. I don't really care about business or money, adhering to the philosophy that money comes and goes. But anyway, I read in the  Star Tribune  the other day that pocket bikes are the next big fad. So, looks like he is ahead of the curve on that one.  The greatest rock and roll band of all time: Bradley Nowell, Jorge, Wesley Willis, and Jello Biafra.  Right now, I am listening to  Get Ready , by Sublime.  We haven't talked about anything serious for a while on the blog. Actually, it has grown fat off the complacency of its bloggers in the third month of its existence. I propose a de-bloating of this abomination and a return to business as usual. I mean, I haven't called one of my fellow bloggers a bad name in probably two weeks.   Oh yeah: I heard John and Pammy broke up. When I asked Jan about it, he said, "sort of," and refused to say anything else. I mean, come on: I heard about this from Chris Derby, not John. I would venture to say that I am one of John's best friends, and I had to hear about it from one of his enemies. Chris was talking about Pammy, and I told him, and he said, "Fuck yeah! Now she is fair game for me!" He went on to remark that Kali was "hot," and he would take a shot at Hannah also if she wasn't so obviously crazy.  Keep staying classy, Chris.  Seriously, I'm sorry for you, John. I won't say I told you so, even though I already warned you. But hey, I'm wrong most of the time, aren't I? I won't laugh at you, or anything, because I am a  supportive friend . Just remember: if you get lonely, there is always Karla to turn to.   Ah, to be a teenager in love.
