I try every morning though, eventually I'll make it.   I finished Slaughter-house Five last week.  It was very very good and interesting.  I started The Great Gatsby last weekend and I'm about half-way through.  I don't like it as much as Slaughter-house but it's enjoyable.  I also bought the first of two SAT II Review books that I need for my two SAT II's on June 5th.  I got the World History review book and I'm probably going to take the diagnostic practice test tomorrow.  Wish me luck.  The next book on the list is The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway.  I've also got about three side books I'm reading, which are The Portable Oscar Wilde (if you don't know who he is, look him up, he was a genius), The Other House by Henry James, and The Turn of The Screw, also by Henry James.  I'm reading SO much lately, it's a little frightening.  Tomorrow, I'm going to head on down to the pool and do some training to size my swimming up to see where I stand since soon enough I'll be taking a lifeguard test which I have to pass, otherwise, no cash this summer. If all that crap isn't enough, I really want to speed up work on my short story, I'm stuck at a pitiful two pages...so so busy.  Some good news for a change is that my GPA is safe, math and music went down but french, history and english are up enough to cover that and maybe even  raise  the GPA.
