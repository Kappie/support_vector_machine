Well, what is there to tell about me. I am 16 years old I have a younger brother and sister. I live in Ontario, Canada. I go to high school soon to graduate. When I leave high school and go on to college i would like to become a Paramedic. But right now i work midnights on the weekends at a gas station called Shell. But any way really honestly and truly my like does suck. Well, maybe not really it just has its downs. Naming on asshole named mike but I cant really do much about it. He is my moms boy friend who is a leeching piece of shit who is controlling and has no life. He has no manners, picks on kids that are 30 years younger then hime because he couldn't win a fight with a man his own age. But he really isn't a man though. He drives my moms vehicles gets pissed off when i dont listen to him because i treat him like pond scum. But now that the un pleasentries a out of the way.
