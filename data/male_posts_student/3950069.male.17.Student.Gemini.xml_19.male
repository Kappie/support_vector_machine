National Day! hah, yes Singapore turns 39 today -grins- It was such a "Red" day, since almost everyone was wearing the HangTen T-shirt that sponsored the National Day Parade, however, mine was hanging in my closet back home. I wore Pink -rolls eyes- White+Red=Pink? National Flag Colours lar! -laughs-  I'm happy tonight -smiles- I met  you  at the Bugis MRT station and we decided to head to Marina Square to catch a movie after I checked with my sister and the cinemas at Plaza Singapura were almost fully booked. I guess it turned out to be a really good decision to head to Marina Square since the cinemas there were almost empty, haha, I mean not as many people go to Marina to watch movies. So we got our tickets! For the first time in awhile, we actually got tickets that wasn't designated for the first 5 rows -laughs- We caught the Movie " The Notebook " and it is by far, one of the best movies i've seen; its a wonderful story and to have the person you love right by your side, that makes it so much better. We took a little walk around after the movie and took our dinner and just when we wanted to check out the carnival on the opposite street we actually caught sight of the National Day Parade  Fireworks  -smiles-  Catching sight of the fireworks was totally unexpected and that's what makes it so much more special, do we call that fate? Maybe it was meant to be, but catching such a wonderful sight, with the girl I love and care for so deeply, is wonderful. We share so many beautiful memories together.  There's something so simple, yet its something so special about being with  you . I am the happiest person I can ever be when you are there with me, I feel free and so at ease. I shouted out, " I love Xiaowei! " I did and i'm amazed, where did I get the courage to do that? But when I did it, I didn't even have to think for a second and I was already shouting my mouth off, Hah. There is just something so crazy about you, because you make me do such crazy yet wonderful things. I am madly in love with you.  Blessed.   I don't have much to say tonight, except that  I am happy  love you, baby.      [It's not always rainbows and butterflies]    "I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved"      -She will be loved   by Maroon5       I see forever when I look into your eyes
