Then I talked to Kaiser for plans to see the Matrix Reloaded with Paul and other people but Paul got grounded when his parents saw his progress report (English and Math) so he got mad, punched his garage and me and him went running to Jenna M's. We talked and hung out at her house for about 30 minutes and then ran back home. I think it was a total of 8 miles or something. But before I ran I told Matt that we can go to the movies without Paul and with Jared and I said I'd be back around 7 and I WOULD CALL HIM if I could go. So, I'm returning home along Brooksite when my mom pulls up because my parents got worried where I was. My mom goes "Dad's been at our house for over an hour!"... so I said "So... doesn't Dad live in our house?" But ended up she was saying "MATT HAS BEEN AT OUR HOUSE FOR OVER AN HOUR." Right at this point, I was never more confused in my life besides for seeing the Matrix Reloaded. Matt being Matt, for some fucked up reason, came to my house at 7, stayed in my room until 8:30 and watched Gladiator pretending Russell Crow was killing a bunch of big people with Thomas heads on them. It was Matt's fault because I told him I would call him when I was ready. Matt, I don't understand you. So today... I played Enter The Matrix and finally reached the amazing part of the game where you have to stab a bunch of vampires with wooden sticks and kill that fuckin French Canadian asshole with the hot wife. I saved Niobe and now I'm up to this part where you must escape the two albino twins on the highway. Awesome. Then I did my homework while watching Lord of The Rings, then went to my cousins house for Kate's birthday. No more track but I still have the uniform, where do I bring it? Oh well, track is over, thank god.
