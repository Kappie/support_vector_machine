Don't tell Mr. Emerson, but I felt that I was more prepared to take the AP history test this year than I was last year (but that could have been that I never really read the book last year)! I can honestly say that I feel bad for the sophomores who want to take AP US History next year, because they won't get Ms. Clark for a teacher. NOT to suck up or anything but I am really proud of you Ms. Clark because I am sure that this hasn't been your easiest year with the administration junk and all. But I am sure that you are happy that all your work has paid off and now you have a great job! So hooray! Plus now you can give us a bigger perspective on the journey of life! Hehe how is that for cheesy!
