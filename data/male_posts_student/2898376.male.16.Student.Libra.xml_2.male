I'm lov-in' it' is possibly the most evil thing ever done by a corporation. It is widely accepted in my group of friends that the chief difference between companies and corporations is that corporations are evil. (Scientific Test: which sounds more evil?: 'Hello. I am Smith of the Globex Company.' 'Hello. I am Smith of the Globex  Corporation .' The second one, obviously. Anyway. McDonalds. The thing is, the whole campaign is designed to get you. The cheery notes ascending, the catchy colloquial slogan, all designed to get into your mind and rot it, turning it red and yellow. Soon, all you will be able to utter is 'Have a nice day' and 'Do you want fries with that?'. (Why do they ask you that? I have NEVER heard anyone say: 'Why, yes, I would. I am completely incapable of thinking "Hmm, I fancy some fried potato strips, I'll buy some". Thankyou, McEmployee, you have enabled me to buy them without activating my brain, sending me further into becoming totally brain-dead, hypnotised by modern culture.'). I am watching you with my spyware. I have cunningly inserted this warning in the middle of an old post, so most of you won't see it. Hahaha. And back to the slogan once more. I have noticed people walking down the street, humming under their breath, the little jingle. I just want to reach out and shake them: 'Can't you SEE!!! That's exactly what they WANT you to do!! They're invading your MIND!! AAAARRRGGHHH!!!'. And so on. This is just a fraction of what I have to say about corporations. There will be more.
