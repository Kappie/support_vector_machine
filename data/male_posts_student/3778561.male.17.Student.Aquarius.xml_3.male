That was fun I priced some stuff I needed to get for the ferrets.  I have a meeting tonight at 7:00 P.M. and that is for the Strawberry Festival. I think we can totally out do the Deer Lake festivities. But thats in m opinion. At 3:00 P.M. I have to put on supper for mom not a big task lol! Well thats about all I have to say for today until my next post!
