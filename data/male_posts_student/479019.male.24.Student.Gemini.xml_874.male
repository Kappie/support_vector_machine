It makes me think about the  Descendents ' "When I Get Old." Will I still want to be someone and not just who I am. I don't want to be like other adults, because they already died... Cruel, condescending, fossilized Will I be rich? will I be poor? Will I still sleep on the floor? What will it be like? When I get...  What will I be like, when I get old I sort of wonder where Milo Ackerman, the lead singer of the Descendents who has a phd, was when he sang that song. It was at least after he "went to college."  I'm skeptical about getting funding, but who knows... I could... I could not? Last year I didn't think I had a chance, but less was on the line. My wants and desires... do I want to stay? who am I right now? if I don't know what I am, what does it say about my wants? All this will be more clear in a month... however, the uncertainty will come up again later...   I guess a lot of this has to do with the fact I'm in a transitional phase in my life right now. Soon I'll be done with courses, which means I'll really have to start doing my own research. As a professor of mine says, "you become a knowledge producer." Am I ready to do stuff like that?   (By the way, this same professor said he didn't quite get  Breakfast at Tiffany's  either).  I've talked about my schizophrenia before. From 9/20/2003:  "I'm 23 and I always feel a pull between wanting to stay young and having to grow up.  People say I've done a lot in my life despite my age. I was an athelete, musician, involved in student government in high school. I've volunteered at high schools, coached wrestling, and worked 4 very different jobs. I had 2 majors and a minor and I'm in a phd program right now. I've seen cities all over California, and been to Reno, Vegas, Taiwan, Mexico, and Western Europe. I've stage dove, moshed, been to operas and musicals, the great museums of the world and been to a fringe festival more or less. I've seen a punk rock midget, S people, prostitutes in Amsterdam, and met pro-wrestlers. I've been drunk, beaten, bloody, and burned. I've been in newspapers and I have many friends. You would think that I've lived enough to grow up. Or perhaps since I've lived an interesting life, I'm reluctant to grow up.  This growing up thing, where I should act and dress more respectably is tough. At some point in the next few years, I'll end up teaching college course and eventually be called professor... I'll have to look and act professional. I can't be as nihilist or apathetic as I am now. I shoud be worrying about getting a job when I graduate and becomeing "successful." Yet I'm still in a phase of my life right now where I still want to stage dive at shows, crush beer cans with my skull, and wear punk band shirts." Not much has been resolved in 6 months... So I still don't know if I feel ready to grow up. But what really is growing up? Significantly older women seem to always be telling me that I'm so mature for my age. Am I (a real phony)?   I guess I'm in a transitory part of my life right now. I don't know if passerby Tara still comes by, but she once asked if I ever just spill out raw emotion. However, I don't know how to express the confusion within me right now about where I am in my life. I am sure of one thing... I'm not afraid. It's more of a awkwardness and unease. It's like being in a fun house and walking on something wobbly. You know you aren't in any real harm, so you aren't scared; however, it's awkward and uneasy. You don't really know what's ahead of you (or below, and around you) in fun houses. Actually those two words are pretty accurate in describing my feelings in general right now.  I don't have fear for the future, because I'm confident things will be alright.  I just had clam chowder, my favorite soup. Kind of fattening, but considering I ate at the food coop AND worked out... it all balances out. (Actually I don't care about eating fatty foods, because I eat healthy in general)  Oh yea... Crystal... it's cool. I knew something was up. It was just weird, because I was all like... this seems rather uncharacteristic of Crystal even if she is drunk.  Yes a very long post!  ***
