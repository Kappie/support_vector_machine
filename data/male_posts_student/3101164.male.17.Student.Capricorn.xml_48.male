BUT Maria said the guys and I couldnt go because of her parents. Lucky for me, Keli and I talked and we figured it out. So I still have that to wait for. Unfortunately, I have to do "forced volunteerism". It wont be so bad,I have had to do it before so it will be no sweat. So after I do that it will be off to meet my destiny. Until next time...  >>
