I opened it up and found a wealth of stuff from when Levi, Jonah, and I used to play Dungeons and Dragons together -- character sheets, maps, dice, and the old second addition books.  I realized that I really want to get back into it again -- and I'd like to invite you all to join me, Lara included.  I'm telling Tyler Rudd, Paul Simmons, and a few others you don't know about it, and I'm hoping to get together a diverse adventure group of 5 or 6 people.  I volunteer to be dungeon master, but if someone else wants the job, I'm open to different arrangements.  It's a lot of work though.  Don't say no till you've thought about it.  Old fashioned pen and paper RPGs, with the right group of people, can be really fun, and we're going to use 'simplified' rules, so learning the basics should take maybe an hour, hour and a half tops.  It's just an idea right now, but if enough people are interested, it'll end up actually happening. WIGII!
