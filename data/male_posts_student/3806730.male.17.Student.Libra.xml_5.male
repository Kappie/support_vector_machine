But the weekend is one welcoming thought, especially that I need to catch up on the things I missed in 5 classes yesterday.  Dinner for two, was for Richel and me, and it's practically gonna be just the two of us for the next two days.  We had dinner at this grill that played sentimental music.. and man, we couldn't help it.. looking out the window, thinking sad thoughts, and missing home and whoever it was on our minds. yeah right :)  Anyway, we ended up talking about movies that had us ooohh-ing and awhhh-ing.  Like Serendipity, Kate  Leopold, Never Been Kissed, Ten Things I Hate About You, Notting Hill, City of Angels, Sweet November.. and the like.  So forgive us ok? Couldn't help it.. we had a great time anyway, still ooohhh-ing and awhhhh-ing over the scenes we talked about.  I'm feeling a little better, though still not that okay.  I'm waiting 'till Sunday, and if all doesn't go well, I'm going back to the doctor.. I'm hopeful though, I know the next week will be great.
