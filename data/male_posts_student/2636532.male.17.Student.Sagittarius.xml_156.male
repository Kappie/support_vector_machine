So as it turns out, the room i'm staying in at Louis' place has a computer in it that they said i could use anytime...and me being me i leaped at the chance. I already wrote out this whole stupid blog once but it shut down and was stupid because i tried to use the spell check. So if my spelling is really off it's because i didn't use it this time. but anyways, because of this access to the internet, happy death won't be going on too much hold. so here's one of the before promised blogs.  A little while ago there was an event going on that involved hockey. A major event that had most households in Canada watching. this event was the Stanley cup finals, which pitted the Calgary Flames against some other less Canadian more American team. So of course people start to choose sides, and in the city of Edmonton the large majority cheered for Calgary, you saw flags, bumper stickers and the whole sha-bang going down here. But then you had some snooty self centered pricks that started complaining about how people were jumping on the flames bandwagon. That because everyone else in Edmonton was doing it we should too. Now i know that this is a difficult concept to grasp for these people but Calgary was the first Canadian team to make it to the stanley cup final in a very long time. That's right...Calgary, believe it or not, is a Canadian team. And oddly enough, Edmonton is also a city that's in Canada...that's so weird, I mean who would think that people from another canadian city would want a Canadian hockey team to win the stanley cup? Here's a question for you. If in the Olympics there was a canadian competing against atheletes from other countries would it be bandwagoning to do what everyone else in Canada and cheer for the canadian? maybe...i guess i'm wrong. you know, people shouldn't be allowed to root for the team that's from their country, they're giving into conformity...it's so stupid if people could actually think that. sometimes people make me mad. -Matt
