She wanted me to come do banquet stuff.  I just decided to go with the flow.  I definitely could have used my day off for better things(ACT, homeschool, research paper...) but whatever.  I went and had a pretty non-OK day.  I started out with feelingsof general apathy but that progressed to emptiness.  I really am sick of the façade.  I don't care about the banquet.  I don't really care about the school.  Its not like I have any friends at school.  I don't hang out with anyone from school.  I just go.  Everyone in my class wants me to go to the banquet.  Why?  Why should I go?  I don't care.  I really wish I went to public school.  The moral atmosphere is just the same.  Sure maybe some actions are subdued but a worldly attitude is still at the core of my school's heart.  They may not have sex in the closets at school but but if these same kids went to public they would not be any different than anyone else.  If my whole class went to public school there is not one person in my current class I would talk to.  I am pretty sure the feeling is the same.  I don't really care.  I am almost out.
