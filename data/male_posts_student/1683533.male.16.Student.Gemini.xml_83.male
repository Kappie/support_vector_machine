I tried the livejournal thing for a little bit, but I ended up liking blogger better.  Anyways, a shitload of stuff has been happening.  I am probably going to my cousin's band Designed by You first concert on Friday.  It should be intense...his other band 9 Miles 2 Go got on an Asian Man Record compilation awhile ago, and it has sold over 20,000 copies.  The guitarist quit, so the bass player moved to guitar and vocals, and my cousin filled in the bass spot.  They haven't updated their site in awhile so my cousin isnt on it yet.  There producer wants to send them to New York to record and he will pay for everything...lucky...Their producer is the same guy that made Verve Pipe big, they had that song on the radio awhile ago that went, "we were merely freshman" or something.  Then on the 20th is the Suicide Machines concert that is gonna be the concert  of the century! Fordirelifesake is gonna be there, and they are pretty good, but The Suicide Machines will kick ass.  As for the band, Mike got kicked out, and Marty Layne is now the bass player and Ben moved to drums.  We are gonna record and EP soon, and hopefully do a small show in 2 weeks.  check out the  urlLink site.  and sign the guestbook.  This weekend I might see this girl Aimee from Novi, she's really cool.  The girl I was talking about in my last post from like a month ago, turned out to be a whore/druggie.  And you know...that isnt too good...  Me and my dad are gonna go see The Missing soon...so cya!  "Life gets harder everyday, I'll do my best to show up." -Nobody Care
