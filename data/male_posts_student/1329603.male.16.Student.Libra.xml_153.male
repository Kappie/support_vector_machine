A month ago everything looked so simple, but here I am again. If it doesn't matter to be asked... why is it that every turn for me is over complicated? I don't think it's fair, it's so easy for people who are complete bastards but when it comes down to it, I try and be nice, and I get into things like this that I can't handle. It's not only annoying beyond belief, it's so depressing that I might as well go and destroy things.  Other than that, I'm still ill, and today's been alright, I guess.  Quote of the day: "He's a real nowhere man, Sitting in his nowhere land, Making all his nowhere plans For nobody."  Love, Jon Roskilly
