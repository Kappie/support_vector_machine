Christianity is completely off from how I see it, and yet it works in the manner that it should.  So messed up.     Funny thing was going out to Dover to spend time with the Cousins.  That was fun, Ginn was telling us about her job at Deleware State, and her future plans.  She doesn't seem like the type of person on the surface, but she's a real genius.  This of course makes you wonder about some of the stuff she does, like letting my sister drink some of her concotion 'Jesus Juice'.  Ice Cream, and some good stuff....   Meh.  I'm tottally forgetting to do any work this weekend, and it'll come back to bite me in the ass, but I really could care less about now.  I just need to read one more chapter for cotter, and I'll feel good and sexy.
