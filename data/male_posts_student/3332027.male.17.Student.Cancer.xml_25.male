(Notice I said "seemed like he was" and not "is") I have to buy him his sneakers which I felt guilty of the last time I talked to him. I wa already going to buy his game, now I'm buying him the sneakers I promised. Great shelling out another $65. If i get booty from it, it won't be too bad. I gotta mail him his game that I buy for him. I think when we fuck, which is if we do, I'm gonna need to put a cap on his head. I don't know what he did with that kid up in Rhode Island or what that kid does. Oh well, aslong as I get mine. When we fuck this time, I think I should go all out. What do I have to lose? All I have to lose is my perfect hair that I can fix and my clothes. He's got something to lose if his new guy finds out. He's just a sorta friend that I have sex with until I find someone new. Oh well he's a shady character, both as a friend and a boyfriend. He knows what buttons to push with me so he pushes away. That and he proboly cheated on me when we were going out with this new person. I noticed that he called the same number on my cellphone now as he did back then on that day when my mom and gramps went to Atlantic City and we spent the whole day together at my house. Im so sure he called his cousin. He said on the phone: "I told you I'd call you back" He use to say that to me also when I get on his case bout never calling. My ex has issues, I think I'm degrading my relationship with him to sex acquaintance. His importance to me is really diminishing. He wants to hang out with me this week and he said the sneakers can wait, he said you know I'm his friend. Oh please, I can't even count on my fingers and toes how many times I used that phrase. He said he want me to be his best friend, nikka can't even call me back, I ain't his friend. He's my pal but I ain't like that to him I bet. Just trying to run his game.     Anywayz....Moving along. This saturday, pretty pretty fireworks on the 4th of July! I'm going with my friends: Sonny, Veena,  Lisa. Before I go with them, I want to avoid the last time us four hung out. I decided to call Lisa and help her get out of her shell so when I see her on Sunday it won't be like I'm walking around with a popsicle. Oh well, I hope I have fun lots of it. I know it's going to be fun, but I had to give up so much this week just to go. Especially the booty call. I mean ok I miss him kinda, but when I do see him again, I'm just thinking of seX. I have to call Lisa later or tomorrow so we cna discuss other matters to help us get along. Aww I hope we can be friends like Veena and I are!!!  Well here's the blog song. This song is for you my ex! I dedicate this song to you and only you!
