"Okay, anybody who votes on this thread deserves to be chopped into little pieces(feet first... dont want them dying right away) and fed to starving ethiopians."  Well, people started bitching at me that pokemon teaches us morals and stuff, i replied with this:   "Jesus christ, get over yourselves and get your thumb out of your ass. Pokemon teaches us NOTHING. The only morals it gives you are directly related to pokemon, they have no use in the outside world. Here's what pokemon has taught me:  "Always let your yellow thingy run around while you keep all the other thingies kept up in little balls that impossibly shrink"  "Never let some 17 year old girls(i know one was a guy, shut the fuck up) try to take my yellow thingy and all my other thingies."  Same with all anime- it's retarted, it teaches nothing, it's not funny, it doesn't look cool, it's completely useless.  I could take a dump on a piece of paper right now and it would have more artistic value than anything anime ever would.  I say we bomb japan again(or just their artists) just so their damn media will get out of our country and will stop influencing people to become complete retards, and influencing artists' styles(note: the guy who drew Dexter's Lab's style has gotten exponentially shittier(i.e. anime-d) each cartoon since Samurai Jack- he even went back and shittified Dexter. For shame.)  For all you lamers who like anime, look in the mirror, and then slap yourself until you're not stupid anymore. For some of you, this may kill you. Good."   Let's see what they reply with.
