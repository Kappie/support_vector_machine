Sorry for being so silent but I dont spend so much time here in St-Lo... I've been to Barcelona with some friends and we got a lot of fun there. Camping, beach, parties, sun, girls? No. I'm serious of course... Now I'm thinking about my way back to Goteborg and our fantastic flat in which i should live for 2 weeks (15th to 31st of August). I guess i will be a bit nostalgic... :-( I 've found a thesis in Chalmers so far but we are under negotiations to work for a company (hope it will work, if not i'll probably spend many hours in Bulten...so unlucky ;-) ). I wish you happiness and lots of fun ! And i will try to visit the website more often !!! I miss you all. Julien.
