Where action movies with pretty boys have taken reign (LOTR, Troy), I’ve been having trouble finding thinking movies. I’ve had to watch a few old movies to satiate my craving for intellect. Ah well, what can you do, so many stupid people in the world, mostly Americans. I’m not being racist, it’s true. Americans make up a fair share of the audience and because directors want to appeal to the masses, you get a lot of action movies.     I won’t go into this further; I’m currently off in my own realm. I had to run away from reality because I just saw a chick cosplaying as Squall, and that has hurt my mentality.
