Have to drg my lazy bones all the way to Tampinese... Then when doing Mathematics, I asked my teacher to teach me completing the square... In the end we end up doing some question form A Maths sum... so we spent the whole two hours on doing around 6 to 8 A Mathematics sum... However, i've learnt quite alot... Not only know how to slove it, but also know how to use it to determine is the graph i'm going to plot is right or not...  Well, let's not say about the afternoon... Nothing much... Spend most of the time watching television, sitting in my parents shop doing nothing except feeding the mosquito... Those irritating blood suckers... One day hope some one will create a machine that will exterminate the whole of mosquito...   Hmm... Here comes night... Well, nothing much either... Until the open field opposite my house estate... They were celebrating and couinting down for tomorrow's National day... Out of curiosity, my mother and i approached the open field and soon, we saw people of all ages wearing red looking enthusastically up the stages, as thoough there are gold bars up there... When we walk towards the side of the stage, we spotted Mark Lee... He was one of the master of ceremony!!! He's so skinny!!! Haha... Well, i was attracted to their magic and illusion performance... Its Fabulous!!! Yesh!!! Well, i can only watch it half way when my mother complained that her leg aches... Urgh!!! She's always like that... But never mind who ask her to be the queen in my family...  Well, till now i'm still able to hear the screaming of the people... Haha... Guess i won't be able to have a good night sleep afterall... Well, I'll be writing till here... So long people!!!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "You're a prefect? Oh Ronnie!That's everyone in the family!" [Molly Weasely] "What are Fred and I?
