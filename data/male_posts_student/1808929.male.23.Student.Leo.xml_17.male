Right now though I am preparing for my second cardiopulmonary exam on monday. I am pretty mentally exhausted. I get about 5 hours of sleep each night, but tomorrow I am done by 4pm so I'm gonna crash early. Today has not been a great day. It hasn't been bad, just not great either. I'm pretty sure that I flunked my clinical medicine quiz today and I am probably going to have to see a doctor about a minor lateral scoliosis in my back. Oh yeah, my rent is going up too by almost 10% starting in March. Getting away from this recent shit, it looks like we're going to Mars according to Bush. If we get to Mars by 2020 I'll be 40 years old. That will be so freakin' awesome. Hell, I wanna be an astrodoctor or something.
