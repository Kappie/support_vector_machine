I found that only the interesting, intelligent, and (greatest majority) the insane have blogs. I know I fit one of these categories (guess :)) so I started this blog.   This blog will be a no-holds bars release of all the juicy fun things whirling around between my ears. I'll try to keep the language civil, but this is the Internet after all. You have to keep some minimum obsenity going.  This blog will be updated on a complex and developed schedule based on cosmic formations, chemical balances within my brain, and a mathematical equation I based of lemon jello. I promise to keep diligently to this schedule.
