So I've decided to follow the 9/11 hearings. While I was sitting there watching the news, I started thinking about interrogation. (GAH! GOD DAMN IT! IT'S FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND SOME QUIET AROUND HERE! MOTHER FUCKER! Ok, now it's quiet) What is interrogation? Basically, it's getting someone to lie, but getting them to lie for you. You want them to say what you need to hear. In essence, that's what you get them to do. Anyone who's ever found themselves in trouble at school or elsewhere knows this. But I have another point. What good does interrogation do? Nothing. How do you know how truthfully the information you're getting is? You don't. You might as well go use something like ask jeeves instead of asking osomas body guards, because either way, it's not doin one damn bit of good. I've got more to say, but it's not for this post.[/end random thought]
