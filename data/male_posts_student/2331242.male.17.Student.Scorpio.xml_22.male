I spent almost the whole day with Martha.  12:30-> Pick her up @ the Sturgesses 1:00-> Get back home, pick up my rollerblades. Drive to freedom park and rollerblade for about an hour. 2:00-> Shopping! Finally found the Axe @ the Eckerds @ Park Rd. Shopping Center. Bought some boxers @ Old Navy. She bought a belt and some lip gloss. I've payed off about half my debt to her :) 3:30-> The movie started...  ...and played.... with a few bizarre interruptions.... for another 4 hours.  READERS: What the hell? JD: Heh. I am under strict orders to be as confusing and subtle as possible. READERS: Ok... weird...  7:35-> At the Sturgess' just a little past curfew, thanx to some Cricket Arena traffic.  READERS: wtf.... where are all the details? WE WANT SAP! JD: Sorry folks, I think you would drown in all the sap that I went through yesterday. *happy sigh*  Martha=perfection JD=helpless guy Martha+JD=melting  Now JD=giddy  Te quiero, Martha. Sorry this blog was so strange o_0
