She'll be back for only two weeks in August, and then she's off to New York for a month and I'm off to Denmark for an undetermined number of months.   Instead of taking the opportunity to whip out some old Smiths albums, I've decided on a better approach. I'm going to take the opportunity to better my life and get into a routine of exercise (while listening to Smiths albums :) ). The past month has tested out well, we'll see how the future pans out.  2) What I mean by 'amateur-level' is a guitarist who has almost flawless technique, can play extremely difficult pieces of music in the home and can play difficult pieces live. This may seem a bit extreme to some people, but I know and have seen some great musicians who play outside of work and this is the bar I'm currently reaching for. To me a professional is somebody who plays consistently at the highest level and lives music.  As an aside from The Belly, I have been frustrated with my guitar skills for a long while now. I am actually quite a competent guitarist but my main problem is discipline. I *can* play some fairly intricate fingerwork, some impressive solos and some difficult rhythm passages. But, I can be sloppy at times - inconsistency is the problem.  The solution is good technique. What I need to do, and have never done, is discipline my fingers through exercises. It's very boring work but if you want to be a great guitarist (and I really do) then it is essential. My finger dependence really needs improving. I bought the highly-recommended "Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar" by Troy Stetina but have been too lazy to use it properly until this week. I don't doubt that if I follow the lessons, I will place myself exactly where I want to be. It will be a hard course but it will pay off.*  In particular, there are two bars in 'Sweet Child of Mine' (joining the slow beginning of the guitar solo to the brilliant middle/end). I've played them perfectly once and only once. My goal is to build up enough concentration and agility to play them perfectly every time. I wanna rock.  In short, I aspire to live a life of Victory Not Vengeance! as the band say.   P.S. These last two blogs have been wordy and expansive. I'm going to try and curb my online stream of consciousness!  *Of course, this only addresses one aspect of my axe-play (dude!), but it's a big one. I love fingerstyle so much as well - Lindsey Buckingham's 'Big Love', Chet Atkins' version of 'Autumn Leaves', Nancy Wilson's introduction to 'Crazy On You'... fingerstyle feels more 'earthy' than playing lead with a plectrum. One day I'll get lessons to learn all the tricks of this style.
