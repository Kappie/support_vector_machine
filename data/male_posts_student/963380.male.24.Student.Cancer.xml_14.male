Right now, it's a friend of mine at the university of Guelph arguing about the existance of Ghana. While I'm sure the Ghanese (Ghanians? Ghanauts?), if they truly exist, are rather miffed about the prospect of someone a continent away disputing the nature of their existance. Imagine, if you will, your typical Ghanese (Ghanistans? Ghanish?) on a typical day trying to make their living; setting bones in a hospital, writing some fantastical computer program, picking fruit, repairing a truck or weaving the native flax into a poncho for the tourists. Suddenly their loom grinds silent, the wrench falls to the ground, the fruit remains unplucked, the program remains unpatched and the bone sits unset - for the half second that it takes the other Ghanese (Ghanican? Ghanoslavian?) to dissapear. I don't know if it's really within our "rights" to unmake these folks. But hell, they're your neurons. I just hope he doesn't set on me next. Typing without hands would be tough and playing video games simply wouldn't happen. Anyone who does that to me needs to fear the wrath of a vengeful nonexistant spirit.  I think the real question here is "what do we call people from Ghana?".
