They've done nothing but criticize President Bush and had nothing but horrible things to say about him.  This is why the President refused to speak at their convention this time around when they invited him.  I don't blame President Bush for refusing to speak at the convention.  I'd refuse to speak at it, as well.  They obviously hate him and he would be stepping into hostile territory.  But what's funny is that they had the gall to invite him in the first place.  Did they really think he'd accept?  Did they have something shady planned for his appearance?  What's funnier is that now they are pissed that he won't attend, and have now renewed their calls for the removal of his "regime."  These people are absolutely clueless.  Of course the NAACP has been an idiotic organization for some time now.  They used to do some great things and stand up for some great causes.  But now they have gone the way of Jesse Jackson and simply stand up to get publicity.  That and the NAACP has become a worthless bureaucracy.  They have done some good things recently, most notably their fight against the Confederate battle flag.  Mostly, however, they have done nothing but bitch and moan over nothing, making big issues out of nothing.  Now they're pissed at President Bush for refusing to address their convention?  Common sense only dictates that someone you've opposed vigorously will not address your convention when asked to.  Yet they're pissed.  They've never supported him, even after he reached out to them in the 2000 election, something that no Republican had ever done before.  They constantly, at every opportunity, spoken out against him.  Some of the NAACP's members have even called him a racist, which is not true in the slightest.  Therefore, anyone with the slightest bit of common sense would expect President Bush to be skeptical of any invitation forwarded by the group and in the end refuse that invitation.  But it would appear the NAACP lacks common sense.  Then again, because I have spoken out against the NAACP, I'm a racist and my opinions mean nothing.  The mind boggles.
