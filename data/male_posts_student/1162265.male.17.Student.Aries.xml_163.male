Then I've been crapping my pants about homecoming, am I really going to go and would I go alone? With someone? Should I just go senior year and not know what to expect?  School seems to be a bastion of completely un-due stress, that you want to rush through the entire time, but once your through your filled with regrets and significantly older then when you started.  That seems to be how most of life is, you rush through it, and then finally your nearly dead, and wonder where the hell all the time went.  But the time has always been there, you just haven't been paying attention to it.  I guess this is the thing that has depressed people for centuries, not the fact of death being inevitable, but that we unconsciously are racing towards death our entire lives.  Then we get to hung up in the point that we'll die, that we start making up our own lies about it.  Sort of like my favorite quote from the Nag Hammadi   "...God created humanity; [but now human beings] create God. That is the way it is in the world- human beings make gods, and worship their creation. It would be more appropriate for the gods to worship human beings! -Gospel of Phillip 71.35-72.4"  We waste so much time creating our own gods to fear, that we forget that God is actually closer then we think.  Heaven and Hell, life and death shouldn't be such a big concern, because those things that are true "are insoluble, eternal".  To quote the Gospel of Phillip somemore.   I guess this is one of the intentions of formal schooling, to learn lifes hard lessons through depression and struggle.  If school was supposed to make us completely happy, we'd be accepting a lie as the truth, which is far worse then anything else.  That's the thought provoking part of today.   My Uncle is in town yet again, he's been spending time at the recording studio but he dropped by about 9:30 tonight with one of his friends in the music industry, and they and my father went out drinking.  My uncle is still pretty admirable though, anyone who's been that famous and lives that comfortable and doesn't let it get to his head is pretty cool in my book.  He's pretty much stepped down from fame and is just doing what he likes and I can really respect that.
