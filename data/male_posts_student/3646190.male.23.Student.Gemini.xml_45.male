So many emotions and thoughts coursing through me I cant help but be sentimental and nostalgic.              I learned so much about myself, humanity, politics, and social relations.              Myself:              I still…              I feel like crying sitting at the subway all-alone with none of the yss participants. As I travel once again—in a journey that is yet to be understood, another part of me knows I am not alone. Only time and space separate me from the past, present, and future—that my community were the anarchists that died in spain, the people in iraq resisting the occupation, and the better world so many of us have hinged our life on. I know I am contradicting myself but these are my thoughts… separation is always painful….              I loved being with the kids outside the yss conference, drinking with them, laughing with them, and discussing politics. I know I had my issues with the conference’s politics but even with those disagreements it was the human relationships that changed how I saw the yss organizers. It redefined who I am….              Once again I learned that politics alone does not determine my life but people’s personalities, their laughter, character, smiles, tears, frowns, and all sorts of other habits—perhaps through it is their dreams for a    better world and their willingness to fight for it that makes them my friends…              I want to write more, but I am emotionally overwhelmed…
