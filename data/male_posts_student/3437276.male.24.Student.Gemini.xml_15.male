I mean, it's got more than enough muscle for school, and it can even run most games.  I actually went with the Vaio because it had a G-Force card, so I could play Star Wars: Galaxies on it.  SWG was having video card issues at the time, so I bought something with a card on the "approved" list.  Now I want to hook it up to my TV, so I can watch video files on a bigger screen, but I can't get it to work.  It's got this little spot in the back, a place to hook some kind of cable up, but I don't know what kind it is.  I know it isn't S-Video, and though they sell an S-Video adapter for my model Vaio, it's almost $200.  I've tried fiddling with some spare RCA cables, figuring color coding might save me, but no luck.  If anyone is reading this and has any familiarity with Sony Vaio's, let me know.  I'd really like to get this thing hooked up.  If I had a dvd burner, it wouldn't be such an issue, but I don't so it is.
