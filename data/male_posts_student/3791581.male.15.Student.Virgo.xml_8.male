For all the times I've practiced, I thought I'd be pretty good at it by now.  Perhaps my skills are a little rusty since we have remained at the same address for a year and a half now (that's a record).    Yesterday, our friends here in the Crystal Ridge Club community took us to a Farewell Lunch at one of the most popular Chinese restaurants in our county.  It was a really nice time eating, chatting and laughing.  After lunch, the ladies and the children relaxed by the pool for a couple hours and continued the conversation out there.  We've met some really wonderful people here where we live.  Our common denominator was that we had all moved here from out-of-state (California) and out-of-country (Japan) even.    Our friends and old neighbors from the SF Bay Area are in town visiting their families.  Jane and Paul and their kids are like family to us.  Their daughter Brianna is Jessica's best little buddy on the west coast.  We were neighbors in Dublin, California at one time.  They came over last night for late coffee and dessert.  It's always great to see them.  Oddly enough, they always seem to be around whenever we're moving.  They were our lifesavers and helped us move more times than I can count. I just hope that one day, Jay and I can return the favor.  Jane and I always joke that one day we'll be neighbors again and when we can't find our daughters at 2am, most likely they'll be together.  Good times with good friends!    Today is Brianna's 6th birthday and they are celebrating with an impromptu birthday party at her grandparents home.  Jessica is looking forward to attending Brie's party.  It'll also give us a chance to say goodbye to Jane and Paul's family who also became good friends to us during our tenure here.    Well...I really should get back to packing now.  Ugh...someone just kill me!  Hope you are all having a wonderful day in your corner of the continent.
