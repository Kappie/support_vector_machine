Unfortunately for me, though I will not be working at my job this weekend, I still have a lot of work to do at home. Most of my work stems from my ethics class. Bah! I have a ton of stuff to read and a six page paper to write, a couple of chapters to read in my more-boring-than-dirt ethics book, and a quiz to study for. I have a paper to write for my short story class, as well. Thankfully, that paper will be much easier to write. On top of my school work, there are a few things (dishes, laundry) I need to do around the apartment. Yay Fridays!
