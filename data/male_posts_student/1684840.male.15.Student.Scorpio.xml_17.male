I bought a lot of Kool-Aid and looked at all the different brands of fizzy drinks (soda) they had. I bought a bottle of Mountain Dew, which tastes a bit like Lilt, and some gummy Life Savers for when I'm in mortal peril!! lol :D   Bought Becky's grape Jello (I had a litle trouble finding it through the shelves full of all the flavours. The fruit and veg. section had little water sprayers on the shelves which kept the food fresh! We got all our bags packed by helpful staff of the shop, one of the differences to the UK I noticed.  I'm gonna chill now, cya :)
