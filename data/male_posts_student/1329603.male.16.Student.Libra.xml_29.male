I have also made a banner for one of the possible new names for And-then.org - ShipmanClinics.com.  Anyway, sitting here with my guitar, I've got to go to Evesham later with Winchcombe Concert Brass. I'll take my trombone along, I'm not sure they'll have a full compliment of them. They'll probably want me on baritone ANYWAY but there's no harm in trying, right? I like my trombone.  I got my CAYO hoodie yesterday. It has "mm089" written on the back as my name ^-^. It looks pretty good. I might ask the woman who arranged for them to be made where she got them done (probably JJ's), because they'd be cool as a kind of "goodbye, And-then" thing, wouldn't they? I think so.  I'll stop trying to think of things to say now.  Love, Jon Roskilly
