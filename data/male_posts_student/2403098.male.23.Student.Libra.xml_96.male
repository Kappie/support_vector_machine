She's been having a hard time getting around to posting lately, so I figured what better way to motivate her to post than to take over her blog and appaul some people. She will quickly realize thatI have defaced her personal niche of the web and be back to posting in NO time. You may go there, if you like, and check out my post because I have nothing for you here today. I'm all out of things to say after posting for someone else. Besides, she's a good read anyway, so check her stuff out. urlLink  Here's the link .
