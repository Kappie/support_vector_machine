Which is a very good thing..  We have a party tommorrow and as of yet I have no date..  Who knows what I'm gonna do..  but no matter what I alwys have fun..   Thats about all I got..  I'm about to go jump in the shower now but everyone go check out this band called the  urlLink Lost Trailers ...  You can download their tunes on Kazaa and it's one of my new fav bands..  so go check it out..  and I will end in the words of the  urlLink Lost Trailers  "Bitter grapes are gonna turn to wine and take your blues away."
