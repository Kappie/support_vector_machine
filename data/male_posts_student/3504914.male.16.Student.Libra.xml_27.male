Well, I felt so shitty when I was in computer class that I took it out on Angel with a stupid question xD Then in my own presentation I kind of just let go, since I knew without my stunning voice at optimum capacity I would need to… improvise. Too bad I didn’t do the bows and the “haligato” beginning.   Anyway, the day got better as it went by. Managed to take a good picture of Yoshi (never thought I’d use good and Yoshi in the same sentence). After a little editing it looked even better. I also caught some nice ones of the people in P.E.    MY FUCKING FOOT FEELS NUMB . And I should go to sleep soon.   So piss off.
