I think I'll make a table like device.  Z1010: No Antenna Bluetooth Official Mac Support It's the one i've been waiting for Better brand name.  Double the battery life Better storage More Attractive... I Think.  LG: Has a light for the camera (usable as flashlight) The outside screen can have different coloured backlights Cool menu system Smaller Definate free $100 available now  I think i should wait untill the Z1010 comes out that way i can give them a fair comparrison
