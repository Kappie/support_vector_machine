I never really knew him that well, infact, the only time I spoke to him was when we had an arguement about whether Muse are a good band or not (which by the way, they are). But it's still horrible. I just got off the phone to my best friend Gemma, and she was in a bad state.... life's just a fucking piece of shit. My friend Rachel has had to go through her Grandad, her cousin and now her ex-boyfriend and best mate dying too. This fucking sucks. It just hasn't sunk in. He was really intelligent, and he could've done anything with his life, but it was snatched away.... I can't believe it :(     Jack
