Today we had baptism, and it was fun watching all of the elderly slip and fall when trying to get out of the water. After church, me and Kris went over to the Georges' house to empty the kitty litter and things, since they are out of town they let Kris be the caretaker of their house. Then we went to CiCi's and ate. Now i am just sitting here rubbing my horrid sunburn on my back waiting for something exciting to happen. I might do something with Jesse. Welp, until tomorrow, buh-bye.
