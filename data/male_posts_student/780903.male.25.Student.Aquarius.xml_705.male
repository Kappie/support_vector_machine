But it didn't really come out funny.  It's not serious though.  And it's not profound, or sarcastic, or insightful, or witty.  It just is.  It has a melody too, but that's harder to post.  I dunno.  It's just somewhere in that middle ground.  Like reality TV.  I can sing a love song, dance a dance Make you like me if you give me a chance I can tell you stories, make you smile I can show you how I'd be at trial  I can write a memo, work all night Search through papers dark till light I can forgo sleep for work no play Talk about what's on my resume  Twenty minutes to show you Twenty minutes to know you Twenty minutes to be Something making you see That you want to know more  Twenty minutes to floor you Or twenty minutes to bore you Twenty minutes to spend Until the time has to end And I walk out the door  I can share my passion, let you see The gears that turn deep inside me Or I can sit there airtight-lipped As you just look at my transcript  Twenty minutes to show you Twenty minutes to know you Twenty minutes to be Something making you see That you want to know more  Twenty minutes to wow you So twenty minutes from now you Put my name on a list And then try to insist Then I come and see more.  [end]
