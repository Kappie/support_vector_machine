Shifting from a grand collective conciousness of America in the opening episode, Spiegelman moves to personal moments in an attemp to document events, frustration and anxiety felt in the weeks, months and years after 9-11, culminating in a unique style which branches off his previous work "Maus"-- encoupassing many perspectives and roles (victim, bystander, and post memory generation) to document the personal and collective truama felt after 9-11.   Whew... One sentence, almost a paragraph on its own.
