I have been looking foward to getting back out on the pitch ( as good ol' Tommy Smyth would say) and playing soccer again. There are many reason I love soccer season. The obvious reason is that I get to go out and have some fun playing a sport I love. But there are many less obvious reason other than that.  The second reason is the people. Now that I've been playing soccer with most of the same people for just over 10 years you get to know them pretty well. And they're people I probably wouldn't have met if it wouldn't have been for soccer. By the end of the season you have had plenty off time to bond as a team. This makes tournaments especailly enjoyable. Everybody goes down for the weekend, goes out to eat together, and spends time together doing fun stuff between games. I'm hoping this will happen again this year. State is in Bowling Green which means we get to stay down there. If we make it and I'm not in Egypt at the time (Trip comes before soccer) it should be a great time. Hopefully this time we will come away with the gold. I never would have expected to make so many friends through my soccer team.  Have you ever walked outside on a warm but windy fall or spring day and said "This is soccer weather." That exact thing happened this weekend while i was up visiting Matt at Dayton. We walked outside and were both thinking it when Matt said those exact words. There is just that feel to a day that bring backs the memories of being on the field or watching someone else play. That feeling of being on the field, the sun beating on your neck, and the wind at your back is soemthing I always think of.  When you get that kind of day you can't help but just smile and think back to the days of rec soccer at Okolona. Yes, postseason usually brought about weather that you think only happens one in a lifetime, except if it's the weekend of state or district soccer. Today, the first day of practice, was one of those days too. Partly sunny, a little breezy, and 60 degrees. Gorgeous.  But the bad weather was also a part of soccer you came to love after it was over. You could look back on the weekend and say 'Did we really just sit out and watch soccer in 10 degree weather?" Oh yes, our family did it many times. You got to have dedication to play soccer. You even come to enjoy long rides to the boondocks. Soccer doesn't stop for much. Excessive heat comes for Bluegrass, rain pours down from the clouds many games each season, and hot-chocolate is on demand during the fall. I wonder how much hot chocolate we drank for district soccer games alone? Your guess is as good as mine.   And did I mention money. Soccer season means I have a job...a job=money. Money=good. $1=$6 Egyptian.  Here's to all the memories of seasons past, and here's to one more season ahead. The memories i have are good and bad and too many to count. But I know I can look back on all of them and smile. All these experiences have made my growing up that much better. Too bad its almost over. One more season, maybe two, and the Dowell family will be done with Okolona Soccer Club for good. Man, it probably seemed like this day would never come when it all started 17 years ago. Wow, thats a long time. We should get an award or something. Things look promising this year. We're a little low on players but the ones we have look decent. Maybe, just maybe, we'll end our run with a State Cahmpionship.  Watch the lamb...play soccer. He's pretty good.
