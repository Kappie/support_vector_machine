Lip Zhun stayed up to watch the Finals of EURO2004 and while kafaii planned to watch it, he didn't. He slept like a rock. Greece won...NOOOOOO!!! Anyways we packed our bags, ate a simple breakfast (cereals, AGAIN) and off we were. It took about 25 minutes for us to get to the Evan Burge Building, where our registration was held. It was simple, very organized. We got to know a few new friends from Indonesia, Singapore and even China. We were then treated for lunch. It was yummy and kafaii wanted more, but he "pai seh" wor.... Hehe. We were seated with the Deputy Director of Trinity and she was really friendly. She's actually from Malaysia. She came to Melbourne more than 20 yrs ago for her studies and never turned back since. And oh yeah Lip Zhun said loudly in front of her that we're skipping class tomorrow! *smacks hand on face* Later, we were brough on a tour of trinity college. It was a long walk, about an hour. The tour guide was really nice, and from Malaysia too. We had to attend some lectures after that, to guide us and inform us about our acedemic stuff and about subject selections. Almost fell asleep ZZZZZZ. 4.30, finally ends or first day of so-called college. Back again to the apartment for a well deserved rest.... We got pretty bored after that so me and Lip Zhun tried out some LAN gaming. Wasn't too bad, better than nothing. We played Jedi Outcast and Warcraft3 haha. And to our surprise , there's a channel on our TV that shows a surveillance camera at out main door! How cool is that? We ordered Pizza for dinner. Australian pizza and BBQ chicken pizze. Yummmmmm...very full tho! Couldn't finish it all so we kept it for tomorrow breakfast. End of day 4. ****Btw Lip Zhun is starting to join the "lame" gang ;)***  (my posts are getting shorter and shorter, i hope its not becoming a trend)
