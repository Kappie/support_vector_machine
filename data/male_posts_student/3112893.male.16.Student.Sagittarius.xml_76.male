It's a real picture released by NASA from the last shuttle mission taken on one of the extremely rare days where there aren't any clouds. The sun is setting and you can see that in western Europe, it's still light out, but in central and eastern, it's night time. The lights in Paris are on anyway, however. I was really taken back when I saw it. I thought it wasn't real, but whatever. Enjoy.   urlLink     Click to Enlarge   That is all. -- Feanor
