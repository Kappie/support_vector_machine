You should stay in school so you don't wind up like the people who eat there! As I work at a restaurant, I can see what kind of people come in. Most of them good average people (wouldn't want to insult my customers, would I?). However, there are those occasional bumbling idiots who wander in there. For example, we had somebody who tried to order something we didn't have on our menu. The cashier explained to him that he would have to order something else. This would have been alright with your average customer, but this man was a true enlightment to me. I didn't realize how dumb the general population could be. The man after repeatedly being told we don't offer his choice of meal, began to raise his voice asking for the manager. My manager approached the man and asked him what the problem was. After being told that we could not prepare him his desired cuisine, the gentleman began to yell "This is bull!" My manager apologized to the man and asked if he wanted something else. The man said "No." and went and sat down at a table. Ten minutes later he approached the register again and ordered something off the menu. That would have been it for your extremely retarded monkey, but he was dumber than this. After eating his whole meal he approached the counter one more time and demanded his money back, because the meal was not appetizing. It took another ten minutes before we could persuade him to leave. Society is doomed. I was in awe of the level stupidity he demonstrated. And that is why you stay in school even if you are retarded.
