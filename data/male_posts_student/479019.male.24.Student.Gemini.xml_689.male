Now I drinking apple cinnamon tea all the time, as well put cinnamon in my french toast.  Speaking of baked goods, in the library tower's coffee shop... croissants and muffins cost the same. That means I should really get muffins over croissants since they're more filling. (I only eat on campus when I really have to).  Today isn't the madness of mothernature in action like it was yesterday (I hope?)  ***
