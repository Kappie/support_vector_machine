He make attitude. Odip and i feel like beating him up. Aniwae, i kena do 80 push-ups at one time for coming to scouts late. I know, to you guyz, scouts must be the most boringess CCA ever. But, my school's scouts are full ofrowdy guyz. Juz like me. It's so much fun going there every Saturday with guyz like Kammal, Amsyar, Faiz and Syafiq. We used to have Kevin too. But now, he has moved on. Then, thereis a guy we called Salami. Hisreal name is Sulaimi. Luckyly he never came juz now. We all hatehis damn attitude. Such a sissy. Alright, enough said from now on. Can't write too much or the readers will get bored right?Cya later...      Kevin, is this pic nice?
