Sometimes when I get bored, I (being single) cruise the singles chat line (the free one-being frugal, as in cheap) for laughs. The quote above was an actual intro blurb from a caller. That in itself gives you an insight into the splendid summer we are enjoying here in Seattle.                            Matter of fact, it was 95 here today in Seattle. That shatters the previous July 24th reord of 91. The great thing about Seattle .......okay so I wrote that a week ago. It's still premium here. Another week of a fantastic summer with excellent air quality.                       So I started doing this because I thought it was cool. I confused cool with trend. This is just a trend. And I'm not a trendy person. It's way too much work and you just end up giving away a lot of out of trend clothing and music recordings. This is just another way to pontificate and/or deficate publically.                      This pretty much blows. I temper that comment with the knowledge my blof fog creativity blows even more. Waaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
