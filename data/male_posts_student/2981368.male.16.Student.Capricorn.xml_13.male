RE, had a really annoying test on 'Religion and the Media'. Which I failed badly. Threats of detention start to fly around. French, well, it was plain bad. So nearly got kept in for whole of break by laughing at how people were made to pronouce "Euro". Oh, I mean, "Uuuuuuurough". History, we got to (as the student teacher said) meet a REAL LIVE IRISH PERSON! Spent whole lesson with my class and Joe's class asking stupid questions like "Are you a part of the IRA?" "Have you ever bombed someone?" "Have you ever been arrested under suspicion of being a terrorist?" etc.  Lunch, had to wait around for ages for RE teacher to turn up so I could get a re-test for the mini-test I'd messed up earlier. Stupid teacher let me do the re-test without watching that I wasn't just taking the answers straight from my book. Her stupid loss, I guess. Still a complete waste of my time though. Science, Jack started only talking in either film quotes or 3rd person. Kinda scary. Though I did get an A- for my funny drawing of a big dragon and a hunk of meat that said "EAT ME" on the side, on the perfect predator/prey homework. Sir didn't even mind that one of the labels for the predator was "Feckin' Massive". Woot. Maths, got kept behind after school for 10 mins or so for not getting my homework in on time. Bah. This weekend better last longer than usual...or I'll have to shake my fist at the calender. Grrrrrr.  Oh well, badminton tonight. If my leg holds up I should be A-OK for the Finals of the doubles tourney on Monday...*erk* Which reminds me, anyone who is either any good at badminton, or who wants free coaching, should get down to the Marlwood sports hall Fridays from 7:30-9:30pm.  Meh. Back to the world of telling Jack to shut up, and that all his plans are the worst since Mr Hitler Senior said to his wife "How about it tonight?". Though Jacks plans generally don't have as much rascist persecution of Jews in them.
