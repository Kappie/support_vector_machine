I didn't have to console myself nor give myself excuses. Though the paper was tough and there was a major constraint on time (the entire level didn't finish the paper, not even the top student), i knew i had fallen short of my capabilities.  What was the cause? Complacency. Yes, i was too over-confident that i felt i didn't need to practice Differenciation and Parametric Eqns. The only Question i scored fully was 3D trigo, which was actually the only chapter i bothered to practice the night before. Despite the paper being difficult, i actually could do all the qns. But because of my lack of practice, i was unable to think through the qns quickly enough, and frequently got stuck due to careless mistakes. i have only myself to blame.  What made my day worse were the hurtful comments i recieved from people. Fine!!!! Shoot me with comments like "Don't be a jerk Chris, 3/4 of the level failed and you're mourning over your  B " ; " You are ****ing egoistic Chris. Stop acting, we all know you did well". They think i'm just ACTING disappointed to draw attention to myself!!!!!Fine!!!! Be happy with your  F  then!!!i know it looks good on you!!!!!!  Ppl don't understand that we all have different expectations of ourselves. They think that i have no right to be disappointed just because i did so much better than them!!! Why can't they be more understanding? I acknowledge that at times i am egoistic, and can be over-contented with my grades at times. But it only adds on to the disappointment when they say things like that when i'm already upset over it...
