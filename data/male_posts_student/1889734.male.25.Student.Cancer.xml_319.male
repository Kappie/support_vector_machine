Bill Simmons is my favorite sports columnist, he writes for espn.com's Page Two, he blends pop culture references with insightful sports commentary and makes you feel like you are reading a conversation you had with your friends while watching the game over wings.  So anyway, the main reason I am posting this is for Todd and Steve since there are references to the hatred of Bill Lambier and Isiah and they should get a kick.   urlLink Year of the Phony
