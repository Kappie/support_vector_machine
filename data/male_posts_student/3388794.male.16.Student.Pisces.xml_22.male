I'm holding on to nothing that wil happen in the near future. i hate the way that i have to say so many goodbyes, there are a few people i won't be saying goodbye to, you know who you are, if you want me to say goodbye, i will bow down and carry on, but i will therefore only ever want to exist, i will never want to live again. i want to say thank you to all of those who have carried me, over the recent months, not many of you know but, i have been suffering with a saught of depression, not clinical, but what can only be described as emptyness; thankyou for lifting me and draging me that extra yard. thankyou for holding me up so i could take the punches, the hugs and the kisses.  thank you, all of you.  but especially, you.....you know who i mean.
