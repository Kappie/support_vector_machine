It's either:     NerveStaple:  Hey.  SomeLoser:  hi.  NerveStaple:  What's up?  SomeLoser:  nm u?  NerveStaple:  same.   long period of silence until someone signs off     Even attempts to answer the dreaded "nm u" with something that actually is up will result in failure.     SomeLoser:  nm u?  NerveStaple:  I climbed mount everest, was shot out of a cannon to the moon, and developed a cure for cancer.  SomeLoser:  k   long period of silence until someone signs off     Your online relationship with this person can be considered in cardiac arrest. Only extreme shock will bring you back to normal conversation.  *fwipfwipfwip* CLEAR! *BzzzzzZZPT!*      NerveStaple:  I like paying for sex.  SomeLoser:  hi.  SomeLoser:  .  SomeLoser:  what?  NerveStaple:  oh, i was only joking.  SomeLoser:  haha, you're so funny jim. remember that time that you were funny once?  NerveStaple:  yeah... that was great.  NerveStaple:  so do anything interesting lately?  SomeLoser:  oh yeah, i have got LOADS to tell you. ...   conversation continues, living a long and fulfilling life until it dies of old age     Note: Telling people you enjoy paying for sex is not a good idea.  End Transmission.
