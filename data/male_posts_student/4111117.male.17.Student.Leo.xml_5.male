It was the morning of August 9th, 1995, and you’d just heard, and apparently so had he, and you walked out of your house, and sat on the grass for a bit, crying. Yet something beckoned you upwards. So you stood up, and you saw a shirt design you’d recognize from anywhere in the world, a shirt design you’d seen millions of times. He is crying, too. You don’t know what to make of it all. You are both so stunned. You can’t fathom no fall tour, no Jerry, no Jerry, no fall tour. It hasn’t even begun to sink in yet. It’s only eleven-fourteen. Yet, you feel you’ve endured ten years of pain, ten years of grief, when you received that phone call from your friend from tour, Stella Blue, that the old man was gone. He’s gone, you thought, like a steam locomotive rolling down the track. Your first instinct whenever you hear a Dead song is to smile, but today, it isn’t the same, and it’s all over for you. You get up, look on your floor, and you see the shirt you once decided you’d wear when this day came, but you never really expected this day would come. They would always be around. Then you begin to categorize every single show you ever missed; great ones like 5-14-74, 5-5-77, 5-7-77, aw shit, the entire May east coast tour of 1977, and that final show at Soldier Field, where Stella Blue said that the Box of Rain they played had some special meaning, especially when Bobby belted out "A box of rain will ease the pain, and your love will see me through." So you see Jerry’s face, smiling through it, and above him, it says "There’s Thing’s You Can Replace" and below him, it says, "And Other’s You Cannot" and you categorize how many show’s you’ve seen when they played Althea, all the while feeling this immense tightening in your throat, and an immense bout of sobs threatening to begin. So you let it go, and it all comes out, every last bit of energy you had is bent on sobbing for Jerry. Your vision is skewed now, and you cannot understand why this is happening, why there isn’t going to be a fall tour, why there isn’t going to be anymore Terrapin Station’s with Jerry hanging on the word lad-y, and why oh why will there never be another veggie burrito, with cucumbers, carrots, tomato’s, all the vegetable goodness, all gone, every last thing, your purpose on life for the past twenty-five years, your source of income, joy, pride, your family, your grateful family, your kind family, all of it over with the one call from Stella Blue. So you have to leave your house, and you do, but you don’t get as far as the grass, where you begin to sob again, then you see him, with THAT shirt on, the shirt which will always tie you to anyone who wears one. You see each other, you look into each other’s sobbing eyes, and you embrace, for five minutes you embrace, laughing, sobbing, laughing, sniffling, it’s all wet, it’s all uncomfortable, but it’s all fine, you don’t care, you don’t care anymore. Yet when you leave each other, you keep walking, down the cozy streets, where V-Dub’s with the Roses and the Skeletons, or the Steal Your Face logo haunt you. Some of them must know, but other’s don’t. And as you see those who do know, you embrace them as well, and down on the turnaround, by the beach, a dozen of us get into a circle, sway back and forth, find the groove that he gave us, and remember watching him smile, smile, smile, and remember that there is nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile, and you do, and as we smile with each other, through red eyes and tear-streaked cheeks, you understand that everything will be all right, because you are a family, a grateful family. So that is that, you think, but the pain doesn’t go away, it’s always there whenever he sings, or his guitar reverberates where you, or you remember him smiling at you, and you smiling back, and you feel the hair on the back of your neck begin to stand on end. And you realize because you were there for Jerry, and he was there for you, that you two are cosmically bound, with some indelible ray of light, no matter how infinitesimally inane you feel at times, Jerry is inside you, looking out for you. No Jesus, no Buddha, no Mohammed, no Vishnu, no matter, because you’ve had Jerry, and that’s all you need, thank you very much, all you need for joy, for brotherhood, for friendship, for everything was included in Jerry, the old man. Thanks for everything. b J Ward   i wrote that, also in may, for a creative writing showcase at my school to convey the strong feelings i was having for a man i'd never met, a man who to me was still a mystery, a man simply named jerry, a man who died 9 years ago today. whenever you watch him perform, his shaggy hair dropping down to his all too familiar black shirt, his right middle finger non-existent, his voice so soulful, believing in every word he ever sang. every note was special. but to gaze out into the audience, to see people transfixed by this man, is truly special. grown men cry when he plays guitar, people with no other will to live other than seeing the Grateful Dead perform shower themselves in his watery tones, his sublime skill only matched by his supporting cast, no matter who's on keys; preferably pigpen, but keith and brent sure had their day. no matter if its just bill, but preferably its both bill and mickey. there will never be another jerry, no matter what. nobody can capture what he captured. he is the epitome of the visceral spirit of the human being. he truly is one of the most important human beings to ever live. his music is timeless, his smile is flawless and his legacy golden.  so this is robert hunters eulogy for jerry, a very amazing and immensely powerful piece to read  Jerry, my friend, you've done it again, even in your silence the familar pressure comes to bear, demanding I pull words from the air with only this morning and part of the afternoon to compose an ode worthy of one so particular about every turn of phrase, demanding it hit home in a thousand ways before making it his own, and this I can't do alone.  Now that the singer is gone, where shall I go for the song? Without your melody and taste to lead an attitude of grace a lyric is an orphan thing, a hive with neither honey's taste nor power to truly sting. What choice have I but to dare and call your muse who thought to restout of the thin blue air, that out of the field of shared time, a line or two might chance to shine ;  As ever when we called, in hope if not in words,the muse descends. How should she desert us now? Scars of battle on her brow, bedraggled feathers on her wings, and yet she sings, she sings! May she bear thee to thy rest,the ancient bower of flowers beyond the solitude of days, the tyranny of hours;  the wreath of shining laurel lie upon your shaggy head, bestowing power to play the lyre to legions of the dead. If some part of that music is heard in deepest dream, or on some breeze of Summe ra snatch of golden theme, we'll know you live inside us with love that never parts our good old Jack O'Diamonds become the King of Hearts.  I feel your silent laughter at sentiments so bold that dare to step across the line to tell what must be told, so I'll just say I love you which I never said before and let it go at that old friend,the rest you may ignore.-Robert Hunter  So beautiful, so true, one man's best friend gone. puts a tear to my eye, i'm not ashamed. when you are touched by something, you have got to show it. today, i challenge everyone reading this to be kind to someone they otherwise wouldn't be kind to, to show someone how truly they special they are to you, to thank them for being there. i'd like to thank jerry right now, thank him for all he taught me, without ever speaking to me, thank him for all the memories of riding in a car, listening to his music. jerry truly is an ethereal gift, a special person set on this earth to bring happiness. he truly is missed. have a nice sleep, jerry, i can wait to meet you but i can't wait you meet you  with love
