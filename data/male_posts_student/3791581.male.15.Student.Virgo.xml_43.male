He took it upon himself to book a five star Hotel and Spa weekend getaway... spa services included! All this, with no prior coaching or training.  Estancia Hotel and Spa is located in La Jolla, just 15 minutes north of San Diego. Not only were the suites luxurious, but the grounds were gorgeous. Spanish inspired architecture, blue mosaic tiled fountains, juniper evergreen trees, rows of red bougainvillea, huge queen and sago palms...a verdant oasis.  We were greeted by courteous valet people and escorted to the front desk, where we were served champagne. We were a bit thrown off by the person helping us check in. She was bilingual and that's a plus for her line of work...Let's just say our check-in would have gone a bit quicker, if we knew Japanese. After that was taken care of, our bell hop proceeded to give us a tour of the grounds and facility, then showed us our room. I felt bad since we could have just carried our own luggage, instead of him pushing around this huge cart. I guess that's how the wealthy folk do it.  We made it a point to get some R  R over the weekend. Saturday morning and well into the afternoon was spent eating, swimming and relaxing by the pool. We also indulged in a couple's massage. I was afraid for Norm, since this was his first time getting a professional massage. He was a tad bit nervous, but ended up loving it and now a firm believer of the power of touch . Now I have to convince him that manly men get facials and pedicures too. Later on that evening, we had dinner at Roy's, which offers Hawaiian-Asian fusion cuisine. How fitting it was to have dinner here for our 1 year, as we did in Maui after our wedding.  If you guys ever decide to visit Norm and I, we'll be sure to take you to San Diego and the surrounding area. We were able to visit Mission Bay, which is home to Shamu. All the beaches are beautiful there, especially Mission Cove, where you can do a bit of snorkeling and scuba. I never tire of Balboa Park, which extends beyond breathtaking gardens, but wildlife, museums, art, music and performance. There is always something happening there.  A+ for a beautifully planned weekend.  One thing I do have to mention though...The first night we were there, I jumped into the fluffy bed and dove under the smooth crisp linens. But to my utter dismay, my skin broke out into hives! Being a five star frou-frou hotel, you would think the guests would be spoiled with nothing but 500 plus thread count Egyptian cotton? I had to check the label, it read 60/40 Cotton/Poly!!! I'm not trying to act like a princess, but cotton is the only way to go. :)
