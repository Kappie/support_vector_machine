However there are two main issues that the Aeta in Pilien want to address:    1) Livelihood projects that not only ensure a steady income but also offers increased income over time.    2) Education for their children. Usually there are no educational opportunities for Aetas in Pilien unless they move to Santa Juliana or Maruglo. I was informed that there was once a school in Pilien and that a good road existed however after Mt. Pinatubo's eruption, the school was destroyed and the road was demolished.     Possible ideas    1) Follow-up with local and provincial government units to find out what the status is for building a new school,  2) Recruit local Aeta who would be interested in being teachers and educate them.
