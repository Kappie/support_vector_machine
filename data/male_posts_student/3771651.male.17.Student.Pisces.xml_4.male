I decided to start today because it is the day after the nation's 39th  birthday (HAppY birthdAy SingApOrE!) and myself turning 18 in six months time. A new beginning lah. Two days ago I went to Pan Pacific Hotel with my family to catch the fireworks display near the Esplanade. It was my auntie who booked the hotel room. Wow, it was such a spectacular display. I was watching from the 29th floor by the balcony and the hotel was just a few metres away from Marina Promenade. The fireworks were blasting like right in front of my face man!. Never have I ever seen fireworks that close before. If only I was out with my friends that night(sigh). The blasts were particularly deafening. I felt like my ears were going to pop. After the fireworks display we had dinner and headed back home. Yesterday, National Day, I can not believe I missed the whole show because went bowling in the evening. Luckily I managed to catch the fireworks display when we headed out for dinner. Today, even better, never did a thing, stayed at home and slept the whole day (lAzY bOy! I tirEd whAt).
