Officer  Esther Rayes  reported that no suspect has been identified in the robbery, by which large amounts of jewelry, personal items, and money were stolen. Further theft may explain a missing laptop, video tapes, and several pictures of  Paris  with ex-beau  Nick Carter .  00000000000000-0   Police forensics have leaked that the criminal most likely entered from behind the house and was able to easily lift the goods. They continued to comment that it's a safe bet to say that this isn't the first intruder through  Paris Hilton's  rear.
