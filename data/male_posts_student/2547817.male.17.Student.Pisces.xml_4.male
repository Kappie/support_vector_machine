I have several wishes for the world. 1) That more and more people come to know our dear Lord and Saviour. 2) That unrest would come to a stand-still for at least a day. 3) That someone's life would be touched by the North Star. 4) That people love instead of hate. 5) That Jesus comes soon.  Additionally I would like to add one or two wishes for myself. 1) That God would be pleased with what he sees in me. 2) That by a miracle, I'd get Zel back.  A risky post, I am fully aware of the implications. At the moment i'm not really sure where my heart lies. I choose to be thankful for who and what I have at present.  I'm thankful for a roof over my head and a God who loves me, over my roof. I'm thankful for Mummy, Aunty Delia, Natasha, Ian, Pati, Tata and Daddy, wherever he is. I'm thankful that they love me. I'm thankful that i have friends whom i love and that they love me unconditionally in return. I'm thankful for my salvation. I'm thankful for Zel I give thanks for many things... and i am able to do so because i choose to look at the good side of things, and not the bad. I choose.  Thank you Jesus for You and Choice.
