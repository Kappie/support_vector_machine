How can he compare these 2. We really had trouble hitting those lobbing ball. We were not trained to hit those. I repeat,  WE HAD NO TRAINING ON THOSE TOSS BALLS . And another thing, coach substituted me for no good reasons. When Gary came in for me, it was 3-0, no runs conceded yet. So the score became 3-2 just after Chai Chee was able to hit his pitch, deep to left field, why? Gary had good accuracy, i admit. But, he should gather more speed, so that enemies cant hit any. That's why i chose to be the fatest. Even balls can be strike, they swing as their eyes cant take fast pitches. I striked out 5 people in this game, 4 walks. What's wrong with walks? So, its only strike-out or walk, no hits. Coach doesn't praise for strike-outs. he only remembers those mistakes. I really think that gary need to improve his speed, other schools can hit better than Chai Chee, and with accuracy, many can hit far. Speed is really important. I am the fastest, with some accuracy. Gary is the most accurate, with some speed. Hai Wei has some accuracy and some speed. Well, Gary is really Good against schools which cant bat, accuracy takes an important part of the game. AGainst good schools, speed is more important. It's either strike-out (maybe they cant eye), or walk (since i dont have alot of accuracy as Gary.). I really doubt whether some can hit fast pitches. So, i decided to choose speed over accuracy.
