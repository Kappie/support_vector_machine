I probably should view more folks, try to capture as many stories as I can, but honestly I can't focus on it.  I'm right now the elder statesman at Flightpath, as everyone who was here when I came is now gone, usurped by a new generation of studious individuals, slackers, crammers, and grabassers.  And I'm only really viewing three of the 20+ folks here.  Some of it must be periphery...I'm not going to stretch my neck to see the mannerisms of the woman in poncho to my direct right (unless the poncho was a hoody sweater and she was festidiously hot).  But a lot is just focus...get more out of less than overwhelm.    *This theory has always been my way of viewing girls.  Doesn't matter where the hell I go...I could be at the beach, surrounded by hundreds of bikini-clad co-ed hotties, and I'd pick one out.  And that would be the person that I'd consider, think about, and if the juevos grow, talk to.  If a boyfriend enters the picture, then I'm just fuckered for that night.    *The problem with study groups at coffee shops is that you can't tell who is together and who is not.  The Jena Malone look-alike who is in perfect eyeshot from my vantage point, hair pulled into the cutest of ponytails, tight black collared shirt showing a neverending glimpse of midriff, is with some dweeb-o and another hot girl who I saw later and is wearing a hipster black mesh hat, and lacks the personality or smile of the Secret Lives of Altar Boys star.  It's just a study thing, but the group is overwhelming.  When at the single table, you can go up, plop down, work out a way to start a conversation.  Three people is too much of a burden to bear, especially when alliances aren't well-defined.    *I've written 20 pages in two days.  It's not the greatest work, but I decided yesterday that I needed to finish the script and then go into rewrites to get peoples' motivations proper.  In the past, I'd start the rewrite now, and expect final draft perfection.  Maybe this is growth as a writer.  Hopefully the tongue-lashing Bob Foshko will undoubtabdly pile upon my mash will not deter me from continuing this apprach in future.    *RealRhapsody kicks some serious ass.    *A pick-up I once gave Daniel Young, for a girl who worked at a coffee shop he frequented and with whom he was amicable, but hoped for more:   go up, lean against the counter, and ask her if you can buy her a cup of coffee.   I thought, depending on how well he knows her and what her demeanor is, it could be masterful.  Yet I'd never use it.  Why?
