Meaning... darker, more depressing, and Harry has finished going through puberty. Basically, they are trying to make it not so kiddy and more full of substance. I'm not sure how much intellectual stimulation can be pumped into the movie... the books don't seem to offer much. Or maybe I'm just blind.
