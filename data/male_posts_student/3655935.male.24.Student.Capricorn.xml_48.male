So, instead of relying on my own discernment, I've decided to bear my soul to my closest friends and ask for help.  Basically, I want to know if it is okay for me to listen to certain bands.  For example, if I listen to Moby, is that cool or is that lame?  Should I roll down the windows if I wanna play Nirvana's Nevermind album or should I roll the windows up and pretend it's Hoobastank?  Are the Gin Blossoms considered acceptable relics of the nineties or lame rock-pop?  I've been known to listen to Styx, Rush, Billy Joel, Cat Stevens, Van Halen, Neil Diamond, and Kansas--should I be embarrassed to confess this?  Am I too old to claim bands like Evanescence and Nickelback?  Is it acceptable to listen to the Smashing Pumpkins'  Siamese Dream  album nowadays?  If I went on a date and put on Seven Mary Three's  Rock Crown  album would this be a clever move showing my accute taste of music or would it be a demonstration of how "out of touch" I've become?  If you are my real friends, you will love me enough to tell me the truth.
