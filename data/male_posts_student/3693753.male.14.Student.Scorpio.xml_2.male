Harry! Harry Potter! Welcome back! Did you have a good summer?   Harry: No! Voldemort's returned, and he's trying to kill me...again!   Ron: I heard. We need Hermione. Is she here yet?   [Hermione enters, wearing a blouse with a plunging neckline, and possessing rather significant cleavage]   Hermione: I got here hours ago. I've been in the library, reseraching cloaking spells.   Ron: Ah, heh, ah, Hermione! Mmmmm...ha, oh, er.   Harry: Hello, Hermione. Welcome back. How was your summer?   Hermione: Boring. Nothing happened.   Harry: Really? Seems like a lot happened.   Hermione: I don't know what you're talking about.   Ron: I can think of a couple things that happened. It's just that, you see, it's only been a few months since we last saw you, yet, um, ah, ha...wow! [Harry fixes him with a glare]   Harry: Ron just means that, ah, you look very nice, Hermione.   Hermione: Thank you, Harry. But we have to perform this cloaking spell to protect you from Voldemort. [raises arms and clasps her hands behind her head, thus enhancing her bosom] Protectium invisibum! Come on, what are you waiting for?   [Harry and Ron assume the same pose as Hermione]   Harry and Ron: Protectama invibaba...[mumble]   Hermione: Are you concentrating on the spell?   Harry and Ron: Uh-huh. [shaking heads "no"]   Hermione: It doesn't seem to be working!   [Fred and George come down the stairs]   Fred: Hey, Nimbus Two Thousands, did you hear the news?   George: Yes, Malfoy bought out all the Firebolts for all the Slyther...ha-ba-ba-ba...Hello, Hermione.   Hermione: Hello, Fred, George. How are you?   Fred: Hello, Hermi-aye-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai   George: Yai-yai-yai-yai-yai   Fred: How are you?   George: How are you doing?   Fred: Let's hang out for a minute. Incindio! [a fire flares up in the fireplace]   George: Couchio. [a couch behind them moved forward]   [Fred and George guide Hermione to sit on the couch with them]   Fred: Stereo. ["Let's Get It On" plays]   Harry: Gah! [music stops] We're very busy right now! If you haven't heard, Voldemort has returned and is trying to recruit the Dementors to take over Hogwarts!   George: Hey, Potsie, cool it with the nerd stuff. Shut up.   Fred: Listen, we got a place off campus and a mini-fridge filled with butterbeer.   Hermione: I'm sorry boys, we can't waste time. We'll celebrate after we defeat Voldemort.   George: What a tease.   Fred: Well, if you'll excuse us, we're off to go beat a couple of bludgers.   Harry: Ah, going to play some Quidditch?   Fred and George: No.   Hermione: All right, the cloaking spell didn't work. Let's try a reverse enchantment. [clasps her hands behind her back and thrusts slightly forward with each repetition] Abrendium madicen. Abrendium madicen. Abrendium madicen. The magic isn't happening!   Ron: I'm going to disagree with you.   Hermione: But it's not working.   Ron: Oh, it's working so much. Please don't stop.   [Snape enters from stage left, wearing black robes]   Snape: What are you children doing out of bed?   Hermione: Professor Snape!   Snape: Hey-o! [shields eyes] Okay, let's break it up here. Let's move along. Hermione, is that you?   Hermione: Yes, Professor Snape.   Snape: Please, call me Severus. No, no, please call me Professor, Professor Snape! Okay, that's fifty points each from Gryffindor! Now, go to bed! [exits stage left]   Hermione: All right, we have to hurry. This is our last chance. [takes a book from the table and sets it on the floor] Madame Helena's book of incantations. [picks up an enormous magnifying glass and holds it directly in front of her chest] The print is so small! Ah, that's better.   Ron: I'll say.   [Harry and Ron peer into the opposite side of the magnifying glass while Hermione reads]   Hermione: It says here, "Sun to moon, moon to sun, the twilight at will, come undone!" What does that mean?   Harry: I don't know, but it's making me nervous and sweaty.   [Hagrid comes down the staircase, wearing green groundskeeper's robes]   Hermione: Hagrid!   Hagrid: Hello, kids!   Ron: Hagrid.   Hagrid: Hello, who are you?   Hermione: Hagrid, it's Hermione.   Hagrid: [eyes widen] Yikes. What happened? Take it out of my brain, take it out! Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot! Okay, well, all right, I'd better go out to the woods and tame my dragon.   Harry: Ah, you got a new pet?   Hagrid: Nope.   Hermione: I give up. This is ridiculous. We didn't get anything done, and Voldemort's on the loose. I'm going upstairs to have a bath. [exits stage right]   Ron: Um, Harry. That invisibility cloak, do you still have access to that?   Harry and Ron: Woo-hoo-ha-ha-ha! [they jump and scurry around excitedly]
