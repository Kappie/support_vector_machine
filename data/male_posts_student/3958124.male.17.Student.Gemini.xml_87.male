For a brief outline of Friday's events, read on...   To be totally honest, I had every reason to expect my plans to fail. After all, it's nothing new; my plans frequently fail due to poor judgement and lack of communication. This week was different.  I got to Travis's house about 5:00. We watched VH1 until at least 6:30, and left the house by 7:00 to pick up Kali and Mike. "Sweet," I think. Both Kali  and  Mike are going to be able to come. On an ordinary friday, neither would be able to come. So, aside from Travis nearly popping a tire on the curb outside of Kali's house, picking the two of them up  actually  worked.  AND  we got to the movie theater.   Early  . What were we there to see? Napoleon Dynamite. This movie surpassed all expectations I had for it - which were considerably high.  A must see.  After the movie, Chinese food was had by me and Travis while Kali and Mike looked on helplessly... ...at the TV.  Less posts written like I do nothing on Friday and end up deciding on Sunday that I need to post something after almost a week with nothing, sooner.
