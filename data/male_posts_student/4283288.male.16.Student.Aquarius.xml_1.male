I might change it, depending if I become the Cross Country Manager, but that's only if I don't get a job, because I'll be bored after school everyday. So here it is: 1st Period: CISCO Networking I - CISCO Networking II 2nd Period: CISCO Networking I - CISCO Networking II 3rd Period: Chemistry I - Regulars 4th Period: Physical Education (1st sem.) Biology I (2nd sem.) 5th Period: U.S. History - Regulars 6th Period: Algebra II - Regulars 7th Period: English III - Regulars  Yeah, I know, I don't do a whole lot in school, I don't care for AP and Honors, because I don't really need it for what I want, I can get into small colleges and univerities for computers, so it's cool. Even though, if I work for CISCO Networking, then I won't even need a college education, all I need is to be CCNA certified. Hah, my dad had always told me I had no future without college, guess CISCO Networking proves him wrong. It's hard, though, but it's not like I'm retarded, so I think I can manage, besides working for CISCO has nice pay. Not much has happened today, though, I haven't even played a game, yet. Maybe, I will do so soon, oh well. That's all.
