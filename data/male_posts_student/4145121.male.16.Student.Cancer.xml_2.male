Lemme see, i've d/l a few new band pieces by jacob de haan in the past few hours, don't tell me i'm slow, cauz i'm useing 56K dial-up. I gotta tell ya...that guy's melodies are fantastic mann. And now my msn msger shows almost no one online. My study buddy of the night is now either muggin lyk mad or she's probably in the Zzzz state. And i realised that differentiation is harder than it seems. Not that i cant do the sums, but its just that i do them with such a slow pace that i'd probably finish not even half the paper if the O lvl paper was full of differentiation questions. Oh yea, and i'm still thinking about what to say to her. Lyk...we can see each other online without saying anything to each other at all... and i havta tell ya...that ain't exactly the most pleasant experience ever. I still think of her though i know very well she doesnt. Oh mann. Never thought things would turn out lyk this. Haha, but at least i got other frenz i could depend on, lyk Shu Xian...whom i still cant believe is the so-called neighbour of my Ex section leader. Ooosh. Like...damn, its a small world afterall...(not that i mean my ex section leader's a bad person or anything) Other frenz lyk debbo, LR, Merv, Eugene are all gettin into the O lvl full drive gear already...so, guess i should join in the club too. Time ta slp i think...fever's not going down and i doubt if it would anyway. So to hell with what the doctor said...i'm still gonna perform later at the band's marching music performance...:D
