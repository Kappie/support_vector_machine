You go by the name "Andrew Stone," and you were my neighbor for about six or seven years, and to be honest, I was a complete ass to you. A person that has been true to be for a long time recently told me that I shouldn't let this eat away at me and that I should just forgive myself. I completely understand and respect what she means, but that doesn't help the fact that I ruined years upon years of your life with childish taunting when I used to be a little brat. I don't want to make this too long winded. You know what I had said, you know what I was like, and now I hope you know I'm sorry for all that stuff I put you through.   People will tell you that you don't need to forgive and identify every mistake in your past, but if you fail to do so with every mistake you make, you will never grow into a better person.  I wish you many long and happy years, Cayce Goldberg.  P.S. - If anyone knows his AIM screenname, please, drop me a line. I'd prefer to do this one on one.
