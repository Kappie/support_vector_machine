There will be no regrets at all. Life seems to be back to normal. I slowly and surely giving up my dream of getting the girl of my dreams. But there is always still a slim chance. I just want to lead a normal life that I enjoy so much. I must concentrate in whatever I do. School starting soon. The holidays is almost over. I want to recommend a song from Spiderman 2 soundtrack. It is from Train. The song title is Ordinary. Thats what I am.
