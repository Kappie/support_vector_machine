A golden castle appeared shortly after the last tremors...Along with this phenomenon came many supernatural creatures named Hellspawns, changing Tokyo into a city of demons.   The last and the leader of the Oboro clan, Hotsuma sworned to eliminate the Hellspawn, deceased Oboro clan possessed to attack Hotsuma and to exact revenge onto the source which downed his clan.  Little did anyone expect, that the story doesn't stop with just that objective...with the inclusion of Hime, his brother Morinaga and the accursed sword which eats it's owner.   ..............................................................  Review:  This is a game which i had wanted for a very very long time, I was a great fan of Shinobi in it's Sega Genesis years and was delighted to hear it coming out for PS2. In fact, this game is one of the reasons i bought PS2. Naturally...i had high expectations with this game.  Story-wise, this game doesn't lose out too much. Despite the plot of a city getting invaded by monsters and an one man hero saving the city, it's used a little too much, but many other plots get involved in it as well, making this game all the better. But still, what this games focus on is the gameplay and graphics, at least it's acceptable for such a plot to be used. No doubt the storyline didn't get to me much, but i'm not turned off by it...which is a good thing.  In terms of graphic, it's shown in 3D form and is quite good. The flow of the visual and effects moved nicely and merged well with the fast pace and moment of the game. You can see blood spilling out, monsters getting cut into half, from the top of high rise buildings to the blooming park of Sakura...Although it can't be compared to the extremely beautiful images of Final Fantasy CGs, it's really a good job done by Sega.   Gameplay and difficulty, i will have to say, unless you have sheer determination and is fast with your fingers, you would be better off not playing this game at all. This is the hardest game i had ever played in my life! It contains 8 stages, full of trecherous terrain and incredible enemy and the bosses are just out of the world. It may sound fast, 8 stages that's all...But I took nearly a week to complete this game. Really, each boss has their best way of fighting and even if you found out the best way...it'll still take the hell outta you and your "Ninja" skills to defeat the boss. All i can tell those playing it: rely of Tate. As i've said, the game flows nicely, there would seldom be hang ups or jolts of the screen. The most smooth flowing game i've ever played.  The sounds are also a good factor in this game, the music and mood fits exactly with the stage and place. It also brings out the fight in one...although it may not exactly be enough to finish that place...Another good point is that there can be 2 voices, English and Japanese, with english subtitles, a very good inclusion in my opinion.  Overall, This game is just the hardest game i have ever played in my life of gameplaying. It can make one go so frustrated that he can almost throw his controller out of the window, yup that's the degree the game can bring you. Unless, you are always in for a good challenge and fight...or you wish to train out that gamer in you...I would advice you to think twice before playing it. Not that it's bad, but it's that hard. Oh...and did i say that i have only completed the game once in normal mode and not hard mode? ^^   Score: 4/5
