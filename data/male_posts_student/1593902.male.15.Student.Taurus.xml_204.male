The United Fruit Company  reserved for itself the most juicy  piece, the central coast of my world,  the delicate waste of America    It rebaptized these countries Banana Republics,  and over the sleeping dead,  over the unquiet heroes  who won greatness,  liberty, and banners,  it established an opera buffa:  it abolished free will,  gave out imperial crowns,  encouraged envy, attracted  the dictatorship of flies.    Trujillo flies, Tachos flies  Carias flies, Martinez flies,  Ubico flies, flies sticky with  submissive blood and marmalade,  drunken flies that buzz over  the tombs of the people  circus flies, wise flies  expert at tyranny    With the bloodthirsty flies  came the Fruit Company,  amassed coffee and fruit  in ships which put to sea like  overloaded trays with the treasures  from our sunken lands.    Meanwhile the Indians fall  into the angry depths of the  harbors and are buried in the  morning mists,  a corpse rolls, a thing without  name, a discarded number,  a bunch of rotten fruit  thrown on the garbage heap.
