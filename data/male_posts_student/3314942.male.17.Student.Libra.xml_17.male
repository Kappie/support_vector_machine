Flowers are one of my favorite photographic subjects, but i, unlike most photographers, liek to take pictures showing the less romantic side. This one i particularly like because of the contrast, and the different shades of grey and the touch of yellow in the middle. You will probably see many many more of photos like this one in the months to come. Probably better ones to!  urlLink
