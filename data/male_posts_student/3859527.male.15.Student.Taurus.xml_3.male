But I will say that I feel extremely worried. So much so that I had some trouble getting to sleep. I just can't stand that this is all happening again, once was enough! Sometimes, I feel like stepping in and interfereing, but because of my non-intervention policy, I can't. The policy does a lot more good than harm, but I feel that in this case I must rescind that principle.Whether I will or not, I do not know, but I am seriously contemplating it. I know that I have a great chance of being able to resolve this, but at the same time, there's an equal chance that I might make it worse. These dilemmas make my head hurt. I thought everything would be fine from now on. I thought that amends were made, and that the apologies were said.      I've been discussing this with people involved. From what I know now, I do not have enough substantial proof to make up my mind as to what exactly is happening. I am considering on interfereing in this matter, I will make up my mind soon hopefully.
