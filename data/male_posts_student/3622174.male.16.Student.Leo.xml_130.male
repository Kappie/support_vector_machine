But first, a final word about Spiderman 2.  I beat the last boss, and he was tough as fucking hell.  I hope I never experience anything like that in a videogame for as long as I live.  Now, on to Late Night Bloggin':   My Boring Chit Chat  This girl is just like me, I think...she tends to have no life, because her little disclaimer states that you may come across something interesting at some point.  Hmm...very interesting.  But, anywho.  Tonight, she writes about how she was playing Scategories with modified rules...hmm.  Very interesting.  Not.  Hey, Jenn, maybe we should get together and share boredism some time!  We both seem to have a lot of that in common!  But, anyway.  She also started talking about dead guys masterbating, and that was kind of sick, but, oh well.  Let her talk about what she wants to.  Then, browsing through other posts...she went to the batting cages on Monday because the minigolf was closed.  Overall, I'd say this blog was pretty boring, but, so am I.  At least I try to keep it unboring by posting stuff about other peoples' blogs, which isn't a bad idea, I've heard.  Half Time: And now, a quick break to tell what's been going on.  Marlon Brando died.  Yeah, he was the guy from The Godfather.  That's a shame, he was a good actor.  But, he was getting old, too...so, I guess it was time.  By the way, I'm going to be doing some repair work on bagel.tech this weekend, with possibly the new permanent design.  Everything will remain intact, but, it will take me a bit of time to get things done.  I'm also doing away with the whole Tagboard thing, and possibly replacing it with some new features.  It's obviously not the kind of thing that is needed in a blog.  So, look for some all new stuff this weekend both here and bagel.tech.  And finally, the third and possibly final blog in my series is coming.  It's one that won't be updated every day like these are.  I'm not sure what its going to be yet, but, I'll figure it out and launch it within the next week.  It'll probably be a once a week thing, but, I'm not sure what I'm going to do, like I said.  It's not going to be something nerdy.  (Yeah, I'd like to see me keep to that promise).  And now, back to Late Night Bloggin'.   Across the Digital Divide  This one is by an older person, who is about 40 years old, so you have to expect this to be boring.  Well...it is. He is writing about his trip across I-40 through the United States.   His most recent post is about the Oklahoma City Bombing Memorial.  Most of his posts are about news and stuff.  Could this guy bore us to death even more?  Well, I can see why he's doing it, (so he can probably print it out when he comes home to remember everything), but, this blog is pretty much boring to anyone who isn't him, or anyone who doesn't like pictures of various places across the US.  Maybe if he stopped at a strip club and took pictures of hot girls stripping, then it would be more interesting.  But, he hasn't yet, so, damn it, this blog is boring.  Sorry dude, but, that's the way it is.  And those are tonight's Late Night Bloggin' blogs of not-interest.  Maybe next time I'll stumble across something a little more interesting.  But, until then, you can check out other people's blogs by searching through BlogSpot and Blogger themselves.  Tomorrow, I'll post something in the morning, if I feel like it, and then have some late night stuff, but no Late Night Bloggin'.  Its going to be a once a week thing, I think.    But, before I go.  Summer is starting to speed by quicker than I can imagine it.  It's already the beginning of July!  I've counted, and there is only 17 days until I leave for Yearbook camp, and, like you've probably heard me say in the past, it is probably going to be the highlight of my summer vacation.  Then, I get to go up north, stopping in North Carolina at the Paramount Carowinds park, and then to Six Flags Darien Lake in New York.  Then, I'll get back right in time for preparations for school's great beginning...the beginning of my senior year.  And now, that is it for Late Night Bloggin': Volume II.  Until tomorrow, get some sleep.  It's late.
