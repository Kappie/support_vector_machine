I don;t have a picture yet because Blogger doesn't accept a .gif file as a GIF file...well whatever, I'm sure it's in the right! On a completely unrelated note how is "GIF" pronounced? I always pronounce it "Jiff" but I know some people who pronounce it like "Gift" but without the T...maybe thats one of life's greater mysteries...or maybe it's just safer to say the letters G,I and F when refering to this particular filetype...more geekiness coming up later!  Or How about now...just a side note: the web comic  urlLink   Control Alt Delete is full of hilarious geekiness...and it's funny...give it a look why don't you, you've already wasted enough time reading this!   http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com
