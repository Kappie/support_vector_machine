Anyway I made myself a grilled cheese sandwich and then went to Ames. I seriously came really close to buying a DVD. They had a 2 DVD pack of the 3 Stooges and the Little Rascals for like $8. It was tempting... as was Osmosis Jones for $10. I decided to just wait for prices to drop more on stuff like Die Hard and Terminator 1. Those are some good movies but still cost like $17. Heh... I wonder if I should eventually get one of theose ChangChong TVs... man... that sounds so wrong.  ***
