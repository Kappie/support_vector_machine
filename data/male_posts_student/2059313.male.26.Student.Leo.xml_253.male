I had a blast visiting with my family (even more-so than usual), I got to talk to an awesome person almost everyday on the phone while I was gone.  I learned that Bailey's Irish Cream goes really well with Eggnog.  Chocolate Cookies with Peanut Butter chips are STILL my favorite.  It truly doesn't matter what or how many gifts you receive.  I missed getting to experience the Christmas Eve service at my church since I was away visiting my family.  I got to see two really good friends (who are about to become one great friend - so to speak... they're getting married in April) and found out that they are moving to the area in August or September!   My Christmas List:   A cool new doo, to impress the ladies Seeing my all-time favorite Christian band's farewell tour A cool "lego"-type set of Optimus Prime An awesome see-thru deck of cards Another deck of awesome cards that are long and thin! Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy game for XBOX A set of Legos 264 leather CD case Small wooden figure of my Grandfather's business in the town where my mom grew up A little black waste bag for my car A nice long sleeve shirt (heather blue) a phantom of the opera ornament  and   MONEY!    There may be a couple things I'm forgetting, but that's pretty much it, I think.  It was great.... and my holiday season isn't over yet!  New Years Eve is just a day away!  I'm SO looking forward to that!
