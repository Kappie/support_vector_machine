She was all like, you look familiar. Did I go to high school with you? I blankly stared for a bit, and then was like, I went to Irvine. Did you go to Sierra Vista? You're Eunice right? Then there was a bit more of the basic hello stuff and taking her order.  Now playing:  Division of Laura Lee  - Access Identity  I went to a party with Anna, Katrina, and Josh last night. It was cool. There was champagne table tennis. Can smashing. I also vomited when I got home. So yea... it was good. The weird thing is that the booze really hit me at home, more so than at the party. I was all out of it when I woke up in the middle of the night to throw up.  Now playing:  Boy Sets Fire  - Still Waiting For The Punchlin  I have to go to work in an hour and a half. This is so not gonna be fun. I would really prefer to sleep all day today.  **
