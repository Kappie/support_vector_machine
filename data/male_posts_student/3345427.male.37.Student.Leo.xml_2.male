You see I am in a very uncomfortable with where I sit in the grand sceme of things. I don't know where I "fit in." As an American child - young person - Young adult - we are taught that The United States is the Superpower in the world. That we have the "right ideas" about life, politics, the art of war, and we treat everyone with the utmost dignity and respect. I mean The Statue of Liberty and her huddled masses speech is something that immigrants saw, as they entered New York Harbor.   I was raised and taught to love my country and defend her flag, to stand for democracy and vote my conscience. I was taught that "we" had it best and that the rest of the world was "less than" or "uneducated." and not "Westernized."   I came to Canada to find my roots and explore the rest of my life. To live a better life and to do things I was "unable" to do living in Miami. That was 2 years ago. I have explored my religious roots. I have found family that I never knew I had. I got sober in this city and I stayed clean as well. I grew up in many ways I thought I would never see in my life. I have seen things happen for gays and lesbians here in Canada that I thought I would never see. I have see "History" made in my little pathetic lifetime.   Last year I began the most ambitious project of my life, this comes second to my survival living with "HIV/AIDS." I went back to University. I was so afraid of my own shadow, and for the first semester I walked around campus like a child in a world full of adults. I did not know what to do first. It was with great appreciation that several of my professors became my mentors and helped me re-integrate into the world of education. They encouraged me to just try one day at a time, and like staying sober I had learned how to stay in my day.   A year of University came and went. I do not know how I did it, all I know is this. I have done it. The first day of orientation the rector of Concordia University came and spoke to the thousand students that were there that day and he said this, it is important to WHY I am writing this post.   [B]" We here at Concordia are educators and teachers. The One thing I want to impress upon you today is this: That when you leave Concordia, we hope that you will have learned something and that when you do graduate that your minds and hearts will be changed and that you will leave us differently than how you are sitting in those chairs out there. [/B]   That stuck in my head every day that I went to class.   I did learn a few things over the last year, but most of all I began to see things differently and I learn something new about myself every day. A couple of weeks ago I began Summer Term classes. I am taking Biblical History and Introduction to Islam along with Frech 201. Now I am not going to bring up topics that alot of us are tired of but I do need to say a few things.   As an American raised in the U.S. we saw over history that when the U.S. goes to war, well, we do things all the way or not at all. Even IF they are wrong or politically not the "right" thing to do. There is an ethic that is supposed to be followed. But as they have said "War is hell." This is NOT a war thread so please keep reading. Stay with me please.   As an American we are supposed to love our country, and support our government and be patriotic and "proud" of where we come from. This is where I am beginning to become ashamed. You see, I have been sitting in a biblical history class now for 3 weeks, studying things that have an eerie resemblence to "Current Events." When factions fought in bibcal times we know that Conqurers or occupiers came in and either imprisoned the people or chased them out of their own lands. People were stripped of their clothing to bring them down and keep them down. They were also humiliated and in some biblical historical data, their sexual organs were exploited and shown off.   Does this sound INCREDIBLY similar to something going on right now?   The U.S. as a nation went into a Middle Eastern area that is inhabited with people who lived there for centuries. A peoples different from US. That area of the world WAS the BACKDROP for many of these biblical stories we read today. Those human atrocities were committed then and they are being perpetuated even today. So I mused in class on Monday and I rasied this issus with the Masters Students in that Theology class along with my Porfessor, Mrs Marie-France Dion. She is a Hebrew Bible Scholar. Very well respected in the Biblical History and Religious circles. So I take what she teaches very seriously.   I am also taking Introduction to Islam. Many of my Amercian friends and family are not very pleased that I would "dine with the enemy" so to speak. But I persevered and stayed my course and stood my ground. It IS a class that I need for my major, so I had to take it. But I really WANTED to take it so that I could learn about the People of Islam and the Religion the world calls Islam. The first day of class my Professor ( who is an Islamic Scholar ) stood up in front of many Islamic men and women, Shi' ites and Sunnis and said to us that he was from Pakistan and he was a faithful man to his Muslim faith. That struck me very deeply. I happen to really like this man, as a man and a Professor. I learn something new every day. Stick with me here. Please !!!  This is where I am right now, I need to write this down because if I don't I won't get anywhere. I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I don't know what I believe in anymore. This is not a crisi of faith. That is not the question or crisi point. When I came here, I was told to sew a Canadian Flag on my backpack, because then, Americans were not really looked well upon. So I did that. I got rid of everything that was American. Actually, I sent my pins and flags to soldiers in Iraq in "care packages." Over the last 2 years I have seen life in the U.S. and the World through different "glasses" so to speak. When you live in a foreign country, things look and sound very different.   I have seen the last two years come and go around the world. I have muslim friends who encourage me to ask my questions and look at things from different perspectives. To see Humanity as it is, from a different perspective than it had been presented to me in the U.S. If you honestly look at the U.S. and the way she lives, muslim people were strangers in a foreign land. After 9/11... they were then made "suspects." They were not of  ( US or U.S. ).  I love my muslim friends. They are proud people, but most of all they are human. They respect me and I have been to Mosque a number of times in the last year. I have changed.   This week has been particularly difficult for me personally. Along with the stress of taking care of my hubby, a home, myself and my education, I am faced with this feeling that " I don't know where I belong right now." I am ashamed of what I have been brought up to be proud of. I am ashamed to admit that I come from the U.S. anymore. I feel such shame that it makes my skin crawl. I've never felt this kind of feeling before. I am "Uncomfortable."  I know certain things now, 2 years later living in Canada. I have grown up so much in the last two years, that I am not the same man I was, when I came to Montreal. I feel sorry for those people in the Middle East. Those people that live in the area we call " The Fertile Crescent." The cradle of modern civilization. They were here way before ("WE") were here. My heart breaks when I think about this. I had to seek counsel from a man I trust today. One of my Professors, that IS my academic advisor, is also one of my closest friends. I went to see him on campus this afternoon. I told him where I was in my head. I explained all of this to him. And he just said, " I am glad that this is happening to you. You see that professor is from the United States. And he knew exactly what I was talking about. I have sat in this mans classroom for 2 semesters, and I have exchanged conversations in and out of class, and I've written several exams and papers for him as well. So he knows me better than anyone else.   Dr. Boisvert said that he agreed with me on my position and he said that this "catharsis" that I am going through was very Important in my life. He said that he was glad to see that this was happening, as I said above. He said that he had hoped that I would get to this point. And he was happy for me. You see, Dr. Boivert is one of a few choice men, here in Montreal, who is invested in my life. As a student and as a friend. I told him that I did not feel comfortable in my own skin, that I was ashamed of where I came from. He said that that was ok. He said that this is what "Higher Education" is all about. I've heard this said to me in meetings by my sponsor, that " I am right where I should be."  He encouraged me to stay the course, to work through my feelings and he said that I did not need to "find" my place yet, and he said that it was ok to be in this apathetic area. I was told that I should continue my searching and continue asking my questions. He said that eventually i would find my "Place" in the grand scheme of things. He seems to think this is a very important part of my growth.   So that's where I am right now. Very unsure of where I fit in, I am ashamed at how "one sided an education" I had. I am ashamed at what I know as a 36 year old man. This means that, I have had the opportunity to see the place that I came from, for who she really is. And I don't like it. I don't like it at all.  It makes me sick to my stomach. I have begun to see the world in a city that embraces the world. I attend a University who's professors encourage us to ask and to grow and to form our own opinions about the many areas of life and to look at what we are taught and try to understand it and if possible, integrate it into our lives. I am trying to do that.   Today, I see the world from a "world view" not from the U.S. view that I was raised and educated to look at. And that old view disgusts me to the pit of my stomach. And Prof Boisvert said that it was ok for me to feel that way. He welcomed this into my life. So I am sitting in in and trying to make sense of the way I feel and why. I will never look at anything the United States does with the same eyes as I did when I lived in the United States.   I just thought it was important to write this down, for my own good, and as well as give Stevie something to read. And maybe some of you will have read to this point and have something to say about what I wrote. Maybe Turtle and Tugger and any other "mentors" on LMAO will help me see something from their perspective and maybe give me some of their own wisdom from their "vaults of life."   Thanks for sticking with it, I am done now.    See ya,  Jeremy
