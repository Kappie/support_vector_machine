Things with D. are strange...too much to figure out, and we must have the weirdest relationship on the planet, and i am allreading anticipating the summer and how much i am going to miss him and it blows. And i was so happy last week, and he was treating me like someone he was dating and things seemed so bright, and it was so sweet. He is the most romantic person i have dated(seriously, not saying much, but it is a really nice surprise) Am hopefully going to hang out with J.C. this week, and that would be really nice, but i think i might have frightened him off with my hungry like the wolf drunken phone calls two weeks ago, but come on, it's been like forever and i know he is attracted to me too, and just come on, it's spring time and it sucks being celibate when it is not your decision. Colonial house debuted last night, and i really missed Phil. I remember laying in bed one saturday morning talking about how i bet the nest reality pbs show will be colonial times, and he said let's apply as the alternative family. Then he left, and i applied on my own in some sort of weird rite od expiation of him. Seeing the conditions, probably the best i did not get in. I am not the best with super religiously dogmatic people One more thing. Shout out to the  urlLink Demimonde  ...the really cool message board about Kim Stanely Robinson, politics, society, science, progressive stuff, and just plain coolness.
