All I can think of is that it really isn't my type, the instrumental was great, but the vocals...agh..the vocals were screaming, except one band which you couldn't really hear the singer most of the time! Being as my favourite bands(Einherjer, Rammstein, Cake, L'ame Immortelle) the vocals are at least understandable, screaming bands are *not* my favourite.    Well, today we rented "The Last Samurai" as well as "Star Trek: Nemesis". "The Last Samurai" was *great* I mean, really *great*! The movie emphasized Japanese values such as Boshidu, very well in my opinion; very touching as well. "Star Trek: Nemesis" absoulutely the *best* Star Trek movie I have ever seen! It really gets the viewer into the whole experiance; and the ending *OH* the ending... so tragic... I almost cried(looks embaressed)!    Well, time to go visit some message boards! Until next time! -Aryan
