In college, all my professors and advisors stamped into me the importance of doing something I love. Now I know why: cause when you're finished working for the day, you ain't gonna be doing anything else!!!  Thank the powers that be that I'm motivated enough to pursue a career that I care about. There is no chance in hell that I could live out the rest of my days as an office assistant.  There. Content.
