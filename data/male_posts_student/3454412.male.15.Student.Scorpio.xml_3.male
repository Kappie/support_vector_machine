It took  FOREVER! Heavy Traffic around Washington, and more in South Carolina as we were leavling as EVERYONE decided to leave that day. It was Black Biker Week there which was pretty cool. I'm a little tired now and theres a lot of stuff that I have to make up, and tomorrow are FINALS! Good Lord those things suck! I have Math and English Tomorrow (No idea where though, since I barely payed any attention) and then Honors Biology and History on Thursday. I'm glad that the school year is ending but then I'm not. I'm seriously gonna miss a lot of my friends and especially Ashley B!!!! Well I'm sitting here just relaxing and... well.... I guess I'm a bit depressed what with this whole moving thing and stuff. I dont know.. I think I need some serious time to think a little and relax more, but finals are really hovering over my head and if I dont atleast ATTEMPT to study I'm gonna lose some sleep. I'll see if I can post later on tonight, if not I'll see you guys later. Gonna try and Chill out!      Givin you a little Music to Relax to. This is "Moon over Bourbon Street" by Sting. Enjoy!                   Moon over Bourbon Street,by Sting
