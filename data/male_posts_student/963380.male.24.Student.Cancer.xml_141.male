Forgive me for my wayward wanderings - I discovered sleep, violating our bloodsworn pact of insomnia. I've also discovered Uru, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good and Evil and Crimson Skies all of which have torn me from your bosom.  I realize that my blog is, ast the best of times, politically incorrect. I should really apologize to anyone I've offended, minorities (the russians), majorities (John) and so on. I would imagine the reduced-stress environment that I currently enjoy has made me less crochety. Also - I deal with russians a hell of a lot less now. I should really qualify that statement though - when I say russians, I probably don't mean russians at all - I've heard they are quite friendly and joyous. I mean the bitter eastern bloc'ers who've had the collective souls of their families crushed under the iron boot of communism. I feel sorry for them while loathing them as they loathe me. I feel less morose as the hatred is generally mutual.  My watch chimes at 8:00 PM EST daily.  I'm out of debt. That's a very exciting thing. If I manage to complete my degree while sustaining this level of "out-of-debt-ness" I'll be quite proud.  My weeks consist of consuming baked goods lovingly crafted for my person. That kicks quite a bit of ass.  I've met some really phenomenal people because of a game called Uru (quit trying to pronounce it - it's Ooo-roo - just go download the demo and get off my case - www.urulive.com). Three very cool people and I have hatched some pretty wicked ideas. I hope things pan out - it could be quite sweet.  I got a sexy haul for Festivus. Raindrops on roses and SLR Cameras - that sort of thing.  Glen's leaving my department. I just found out two days ago. I yelped like a mother when I heard. They've tossed him to the lion's den in hometheatre. I'm doing abdominal exercises just to prepare for the sheer amount of laughter I'm going to be involved in watching him crumble like a week old Timbit.  We've got a lot of catching up to do, you and I. I shan't overstay my welcome this time, but we'll talk over a bottle of wine. For now, buenos noches!
