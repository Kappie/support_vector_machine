Feeling fustrated for the slightest things and I feel very weak standing in such position. I feel the blood running down the center of my palm and dripping all over the place. What am I going to do next? And thanx to Manmohan, now even my form teacher knows about my cutting wrist. Please stop adding to the burdon. I'm really feeling weak and not strong already. To add on to the loosing of blood.
