His beheaded body was left in the streets of Riyadh, and the kill was confirmed on a jihadist website.  I guess the silver lining to the cloud is that a top al-Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia, Abdel Aziz al-Muqri, was killed when he deposited the body.  You can check CNN for information; if I make a link it'll be dead by tomorrow anyway. This makes me sick.  Where do these people get off in killing innocent people?  These people think they can twist their religion into an excuse for killing people just for the heck of it, and it makes me sick.  It makes me sick that they would do something like this to such an innocent person.   Where is a leader in Islam who preaches peace?  Do all the charismatic ones go into terror?  Do all of the mullahs and other preachers preach only war?  Youl'd think that the liberal media would report these people to try to fix the anti-arabic bias, but this just plays into the plan to make everyone think that Americans should keep their noses, as well as their people, out of every trouble spot in the world.  Jeez.  Correction: The Saudis are now saying that they have NOT, in fact, found Johnson's body, despite earlier reports to the contrary.
