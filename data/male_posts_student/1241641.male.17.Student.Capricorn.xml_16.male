These bricks are stacked five high in cardboard boxes and put in the walk-in freezer.  So there I am, sealed in a zero degree fahrenheit vault looking for soup.  Of course the soup I need is on the top shelf.  I grab the cardboard box and start pulling it off the shelf; then everything goes white.  As it turns out, there was a soup brick on top of the cardboard box.  Smashed my nose; smashed my nose right open.  I spent the next seven hours at work with a headache, stomachache, and a giant bandage on my nose.  Luckily it didn't rip my cheek open, otherwise I'd have to pull a Nelly.  Anyone who knows me knows I would rather bleed.  *Nelly is a rapper that always has a bandage on his cheek.  Some say it is a shout-out or statement or something, but I still think he cuts himself shaving...everyday...in the same spot.*  Other than that I have nothing to tell or sell you at the moment.
