Why would they want to? Is this something that is strictly created so others can get a kick out of seeing their name in print on the internet- and the possibility that others might actually read this bullshit? Or maybe its the voyeur in us- maybe its the idea that we are gazing into something deeply personal to someone and that we might learn something private about them or about ourselves. Anyway- I'm just trying this shit out- seeing what its all about. Perhaps I'm even hoping that my coworker will read this and know its me- maybe she'll gaze into my world as I have gazed into hers and maybe she'll understand me. Maybe that is what this is all about? Understanding- or being understood. Whats the difference?
