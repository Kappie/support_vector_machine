I have heard this so much lately...but it's just not in my system at the moment.  Sure, I can be momentarily happy, from getting a hug or sumthin', but I can't seem to find true happiness.  If anyone does, don't tell me, it'll make me depressed.   I like hugs, I want more hugs damnit! EGO MOMENT: My hair rulez!  Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.  I dyed my hair blonde for anyone who hasn't seen me, it RULEZ!!!  I would put a pic of it sumwhere...but I don't have one.  So much has happened since I last blogged.  Physically and emotionally.  brb...bathroom break. Ah...I feel better.  CARLY READS BATHROOM READER!!!  **more on this later**  Let's see...what has happened? tre had a pretty kick-ass LAN/Graduation party.  Except for the alocohol the first night, sex the second night, and Tyler.  I left the first night, but spent the night the second night.  "I must have been the only guy that wasn't LANing that didn't get any"*sarcasm**kind've* heh, that was great... Have you ever walked into a room and realized that everyone in it was talking about YOU just seconds before?  It's eery...  OK, not EVERYONE, but a few people.  It sucked none-the-less.  I went to the park by myself and then came back and was immediately told to leave, so I did, then preceded to be pissed. Did I over react?  probably. Did I take it the wrong way? apparently. Did I get what I wanted? yes. I was having fun until about 1 A.M. LOADS of fun in fact.  Mostly wrestling Carly for Jackies pillow, that was awesome. Then I went to the park..and that's where it went downhill....but oh well, it's in the past.  I fell asleep on one of tre's upstairs couches, on my spiked, blonde hair. I never knew that hair could hurt to sleep on.  IT CAN. Then what? I came back home and spent the night at my moms house with Steve..that was actually kinda boring...besides the part where we went and saw DODGEBALL, the greatest movie on the face of the planet.  Then I went to the orthodontist. I GET MY BRACES OFF IN THREE WEEKS!!!  KICK @$$!!!! sorry...then what? Went to the philosophy club meeting and got flicked off and threw duct tape at people and went to DQ and stuff...it was ok, rather pissing me offish...but ok none the less.  Went to Carly's afterward to play FFCC, created a new Yuke named Puck.  He's actually an OK character...better then my last Yuke...but not as awesome as my Clavat.  Which is sumwhere at tre's house.  I lost my memory cards at tre's house.  All 5 of them, it made me sadKICK ASS!!! I just found my memory cards while writing this very sentence....Ervin can vouche for me..I'm on the phone with him when all of this went down.  YAY!!  That just made my day. NOW I HAVE MY CLAVAT BACK!!!  Along with the rest of my info...but the Clavat matters the most.XP  GYEEHOO!!  That just made my day.  Where was I?*ponder*  I've been told to read the book THE NOTEBOOK by Tina.  I keep tellin' her I don't wanna though.  Love stories make me sad*yup, I'm sad right?*even in Around The World In Eighty Days.  Just watchin' the tiny love story in it made me want to kill sumthin'.  I know there is more I wanted toOOOHHHH!!  I was contemplating starting a real journal, but then I though about it..and it would be pointless*in my opinion*the only reason I would need it is to look back on a while from now and go, "WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING?!?!?!"  So, I decided not to do that.  Now I think I'm done.  Gonna go bask in the warmth of my monitor's soft loving glow. PEACE  Spense  P.S. Is that how you spell bask?  I dunno
