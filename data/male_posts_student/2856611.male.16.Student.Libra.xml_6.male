Yesterday! Yesterday was a fucking great day! Met up with Hans for like the first time ever, we met in town and she gave me a leaflet for this website and some how I ended up with her email, but yeah met up with her and shes so damn cool. Kept getting paranoid that I was looking at her wierdly but then I started getting paranoid cause I was just looking like I always do. But yeah we met up at like 1 went to Starbucks and had a hot chocolate which was cool and we talked about like Simpsons and stuff then we walked to... um... the steps outside Marks And Spencers and we sat there for a while and talked about the Simpsons, home lives, music, friends and stuff and then we went to the upstairs of M (Dont know If Im ligitimate enough to abbrieviate to that - considering I only go there to use their toilets) and they had this bath tub filled with see-thru balls so we tried to stack them up but it went down hilll.... Anyhow we then ventured to multiple joke and bits'n'bobs shops and she bought this pen that looked like crap... novelty items... you just cant refuse, I purchased some blue mouth sweets (Han's had one) to give to Nick when he got into town but he phoned me on mine and Hans' next point of venture - the Cardiff Market! Yeah I rated this not very highly at all, at this point her mouth was very blue... VERY blue and she kept licking her teeth to get it off but forgetting her tounge was blue. 2 Pet stores and a fish shop later we ended up in Toys 'R' Us where we tried on childrens masks and bought a childs Police mans kit, with handcuffs and everything. It then got very cold so we sat in the Pura Coffee Bar... which was cool cause we talked for a while again. Theeeeen we left cause she got restless and started fiddling with the Police Toy gun, so we went to Coffee#1 where I treated her to a hot chocolate with marshmellows... AND CREAM!... and some chocolate cake, of course she got like very thing about me paying for her but blegh... Im'a nice'a guy! At this point with the left over cake and some sugar packets we began constructing a snowman, which eventually turned into a russian artist, rolling around in snow, with a fat belly but REALLY thin arms (made out of wooden stirrers) and a scarf and hat made out of sugar packets... great stuff but then they were closing so we had to figure out a way of getting him out of there so we managed to get him onto a napkin but as I picked him up his head fell off... so we put him down and made a cross and RIP sign out of the sticks and then left. We ended up sat on the upstairs floor of Ster Century, nuts I tell thee, it was cool, the security guard kept giving us the EYE though... so we kept talking and it got to like 8:30 and this really pissed off guy came over and said "What are you doing here?!" to which I replied "Just sitting here" and he said "Dont be sarcastic mate! What are you doing here?!"... there was not one ounce of sarcasm in my answer... eventually he told us to get out so we got the bus home, great stuff. Quite a fun day, might be seeing Hans later but I got to go out with Mr. Phil today, but yeah busy days a head, this is one big fuck-off post, anyhow I should go before I get way ahead of myself and write more, arg Im still going! So long my children.
