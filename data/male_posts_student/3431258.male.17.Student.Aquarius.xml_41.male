N is a puzzle 2d platformer that takes real elements of physics in order to give a fresh experience. You are in control of a Ninja. Trained for stealth, silence, speed and agility, the Ninja is what you always dreamed to be, except for the 1.5 minutes natural lifespan he possess. Altought he will not live long, the Ninja makes up for it's greed for gold. Each gold piece will add a second to your life timer. The main goal is to exit the level by the door. Altought it look easy, it's a little more complicated. You see, gold is never free and this time it's garded by Ninja-killer-robots.   The game in itself gives access to 30 episodes, each episode is made up of 5 levels. Also, if you know a bit how stuff works, their is the debug mode, a simplified Map Editor (All in the game). It's not as easy as making a  Starcraft  map i'm afraid.In N, your maps are saved as ascii codes, so you need to open a text document and write them down. When you want to load the maps, you need to get your codes on your text document and input them in the game. I made a map, it's fairly easy and extremely cool. So here is the url to grab it.   N version 1.2 (1.3Mo)  ( http://www.harveycartel.org/metanet/downloads.html )  Well, almost done downloading  Age Of Mythology .  Regards,  Zephyr
