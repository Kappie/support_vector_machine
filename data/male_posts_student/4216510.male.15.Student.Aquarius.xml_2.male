I have a bike now, front and rear suspension, shimano everything.... That was a surprise cost of 80$(great deal)... I owe my parents 200$ now... I have a footon for my room... Now I have a couch/bed.. lot easier when I have friends over... And... Perhaps... I'm gonna be getting the basement to myself...(quite probably sometime this week...) Which makes it so I have a big stereo(basement perk) a couch, and, wait for it...... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9   A LAZYBOY!  You heard me.. the most comofrtable chair.... And having the basement also comes with more perks... Like I can have friends sleepover alot more often.. parents won't hear me... I get my own little getaway from everything, and alot more privacy, cuz no one will want to go all the way downstairs to get/talk to me...  Im at the point where I'm gonna search for another job, my job at McDonalds is pissing me off cuz they're giving everyone shit hours, because of recent hiring.  School starts in 2 weeks and 2 days... I can't wait... I miss it, well, not the concept, but the actual thing.. I miss chilling with friends and I miss sitting down non-stop for 6 hours straight, oh, what i would give to be able to sit for 6 hours straight during summer... I got the best sleep of my whole summer last night!! Fifteen fucking hours! FIFTEEN! 15! I was so tired from the all nighter the day before, after my 6 hour shift... that i fell asleep at 8pm and woke up at 10:30am... almost being late for work.. but thats something else all together... Im so re-energized!  I get paid on thursday,, cant wait.. plans.. oh plans indeed, must make more plans... but must stay in budget, yes budget indeed.. budget, budget, money... Everything take smoney.. i feel like im wasting money typing this entry... but wait! I am! We pay for the internet we use! Alot of us dont remember that... And then we pay for everything else... yes.. everything must be paid for...  Your a queer!  Uh oh, i just insulted you, you gonna sue me for emotional distress? You could probably get a couple million for that statement... Everyone underestimates the power of the penny... But.. if you had a penny for every penny you had in your life.. you'd have a hel of alot of pennys. Like millions like :D... lol... Im just rambling now.. Time to sign off...  Peace not war.
