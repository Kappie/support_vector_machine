I called liveprayer again since the last time and said I had a friend addicted to porn... and nothing much happened really. Well, I am going on vacation starting June 4th, 5th, or 6th. We're planning on going to Myrtle beach for about three days then Savannah, Georgia for about two or three. We were going to go to florida. My dad wanted to go just travel around and stop at Orlando or Tampa and go down to the lower part of the state to the keys. But... we might do that in August... but our plans are being screwed up by my grandmother who keeps moving from NC to here and is trying to get situated up here. Plus we need to fix our bathroom upstairs and do some renovating..... sooooooooo.... anywho... I may be going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 today at the Regal Kiln Creek 20 theatre in Newport News. I bought a new easel on ebay since my old one broke about 6 months ago. It's actually a vintage easel - new for me. I still need to get some canvasses and hopefully some Windsor and Newton paints (ugh... i'm spending too much money)... I think I still have some old brushes. I got 6th row tickets to Crosby, Stills, and Nash tickets for August 18th.... yay... I feel a bit more happy today than yesterday.... I went to bed earlier too. So... my top things on my list - fahrenheit 9/11 - vacation in south carolina - vacation in georgia - maybe florida in august - crosby, stills, and nash concert in august - dave matthews band concert in august.  yay yay yay.... I feel so fucking happy right now I could do a happy dance. happy happy happy. wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I love everything. I love everyone. HAPPY. HAPPY. HAPPY.  Yes... i'm either on drugs (i'm not) or I need them (who knows, who cares)... I'm happy.... yep, i'm sure it will go away later, but i'll sing for the moment. Earlier I listened to Crosby, Stills, Nash and some Neil Young and played my Gibson and the Martin for a bit.  Music - listening to shelly's music over voice chat (DJ Shadow) TV - It's not on, but the last thing I actually watched was The tonight show with Jay Leno and then this morning it was on and Mad TV was on and part of the Wimbledon men's finals were on... but I don't watch sports... I wasn't even watching mad TV... so I say the last thing I saw was The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (I almost typed Jay Wimbledon) Mood - HAPPY :)
