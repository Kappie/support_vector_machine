Also, I'm going to get a box number. When that happens, I'll re-write the address, which is going to look like this:  MIDN Darin Rupinski Box # ---, USMMA Kings Point, N.Y. 11024-1699  Thanks guys. Until I post again, this is Darin wishing everyone a fun and awsome summer and an exciting and successful school year.
