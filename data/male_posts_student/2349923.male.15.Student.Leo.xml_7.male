Try this... 1) before hand preparation- refer to the Command list, then make a rearrangement of them such that the drills fit exactly in a flow of continuous drill parade  Example: sedi-a, ke-kanan lu-rus, pandang ke-hadapan pandang, turning drill, forward march.........so on...  2) mentally, visualise youself doing the commands in front of the squad. Keep in mind, the list of rearranged commands you've done.  3) Refresh the commands. Get a friend to do a check for you(you shout the command, then he/she tick the command as you shout. Sequence is important)  4) Prepare your uniform till tip-top condition(a spotless uniform will earn you more mental confidence when you finish the uniform inspection without mistake.)  5) Mental preparation. Visualise the mistakes that you might make(like missing out on a command, how are you going to slot it back into your sequence without flaws.)and demand a sense of correction for the mistakes.  6) be confident of yourself.  7) prepare for drill commanding, to score a distinction...   Requirements of the test:  1) Clarity of commands 2) Vocal 3) Correctness of commands
