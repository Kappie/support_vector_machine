Ah, sweet LAN parties...The stimulating scent of caffeine, the verbal jousting, the smell of pepperoni lingering in the air, the floor a tangled infestation of cat 5, the neon lights of case mods poking through the scene like lasers in fog. Nothing quite like it. And when the gaming starts, everybody becomes so intense. One frag leads to the next, emotions wax and wane as gibs amass and levels change, here an unnamed player, there an elite commando with uncanny aim. Over time, the LAN party itself, a single organism, breathing, hunting  Of course, I need to pump more iron and get my tan back.  And swim, oh God, I love swimming.    I'm serious... I used to have a tan... before I started to play Diablo 2.  Or was it after I played Half-Life that I lost it?  Oh well, it was overuse of computers.  I love Florida.  And I won't be so lonely with an RTS and techno MP3s on my Toshiba e330 PocketPC.  Ok, this'll be my last post for a while.
