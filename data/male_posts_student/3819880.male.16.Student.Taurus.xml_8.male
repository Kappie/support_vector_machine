Well, just two, but screw you.  1)  Its a four day weekend!   Fuck, now that I think about it, the fact that I care how long the weekend is means that I'm not having a real summer.  But its still a four day weekend, so I can still feel happy.  2)  I talked to Andrea!  She might be coming to visit, which would make me uber-mondo-happy.  Yesterday was fun.  I missed out on some poker playing and Nicole's house hanging out at stuff because I decided to stay in and talk to people from me online website and then have a 3-hour phone convo with Andrea.  I haven't seen Nicole all summer, so its a little sad that I didn't get to go to her house, but talking to Andrea made missing out on that worth it.  I visited Ilana at treats and picked up some food at Vernons for me to eat...party in my room, haha.  Today I slept 'till 11:30 yet managed to be tired by 5 (and I'm still awake at 1:15 in the morning).  Dinner at my Grandma's house was pretty boring, and I wasn't very hungry, but I don't see her too often so I didn't mind.  After that I hung out with Ilana and Alexa at Caribou, Carolyn and Steve turned up eventually.  We then went to Blockbuster, but they were out of Scream 2 and despite my insistence of renting "Club Dread," we wound up getting "Murder by Numbers," which was really good 'cept I had to leave Carolyn's house halfway through the movie to get home by curfew.    Umm, fireworks tomorrow!  Hopefully it won't rain, because I've got a commitment made for Monday night which I don't want to have to drop out of last-minute.    Okay, time for me to go to sleep.  G'night to everyone.  - Brian
