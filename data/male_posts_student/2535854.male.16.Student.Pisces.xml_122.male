Then me and half the class got scolded like shit for not doing econs notes..moody bitch...then sejarah was another funny time..."dont be stupid".Lol.I`m just to lazy to write everything man..Then computer abt 10 or more fellas kena sound like fuck my ashwin for not doing their practicals or is it theorys..hahaha then he told them to get out so it was nice and peaceful while he explained about and how Adobe Photoshop works...interesting...sounds like fun!For once computer class is something to look foward to :D!  Then after school talked with Alia,Nick Q,Zia..and demonstrated our 'special skills'.lmao..for more on that..just ask me!It may sound weird but its funny.And yes Nick Q has plenty of reasons why he cant be blamed for taking a chainsaw and cutting off my head :p.lmao...funny character..  Then came home..ate..slept all the way til 7 something pm..hehe..my eldest bro`s in town and stuff...  Ok I still dunno when im going for Cheryl`s Rodgers and Hammerstein....going for Black Light Theatre on the 6th of July 2004 and then tommorow or pretty much today going to record some advertisement for Cempaka at Afandi`s uncles studio along Jalan Maarof..  so Thats all..maybe will wake up and watch a bit of the Euro 2004 matches..we`ll have to see..later..
