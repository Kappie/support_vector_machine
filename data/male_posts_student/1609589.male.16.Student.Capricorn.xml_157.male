But otherwise it was fun as hell.  AJ and I got bored at like 4:00, so i took this container of cheese-balls i had and said "Hey, throw these at me" and i kept catching em in my mouth, it kept us entertained until sunrise.  I suck ass at throwing stuff.  Church people, Ya know those those tables in the church? the new gray circular ones? We found that some of them make a cool noise when you hit em with mallets.  I'm trying to get tired, i stayed up 34 hours then went to bed at noon and slept till 10... i wanna go back to bed as to not mess up my schedule TOO much...  I'll post back with more about the lock-in later.
