On Monday last week, we visited the Australian Natural History Museum for biology, answering pages and pages of questions on human evolution using the various displays scattered around, vainly trying to find the answers-great fun eh =). My group included Kevin, Sajevan, Evelyn and Greg-and unlike SOME people who will not be named we actually answered them properly, answering the questions indvidually. Took almost forever but learnt quite a bit. Afterwards, we wasted about 30 minutes copying the information we'd need for our biology presentation next week on old and new world monkeys until we realised that one of us had brought a digital camera-I know, Ruse ppl are meant to be smart >.  Friday was a good day, as I got to wake up late (9am! yay!! :D) and then we had a physics tutorial at uni-a group of me, Kevin, Sarah and Rachel-and we managed to break a few of the demonstrations on display (and no it wasn't me who broke them-seriously!!) there was the cartesian diver who we managed to get upside down so that when the bottle is squeezed air came out of the diver.... oops. Then we had a chemistry practical which was quite boring-it was about the purification and extraction of piperine from pepper, and performing H-NMR on the sample. Half the time was spent trying to correspond the various peaks of the NMR diagram with the structure of piperine, and the various mass spec fragments with corresponding fragments of piperine-fun fun. Band practice was cancelled on Friday, but me and Fi still went off to eat at the shops around Eastwood since they told us on the last minute (Friday morning actually)-we walked to Red Rooster, and then decided we didn't want to eat any of the food there so walked all the way to the opposite end-to the Vietnamese(?) restaurant near Commonwealth Bank-quite nice food there, thanks for introducing me to a pretty decent restaurant Fi =)  Saturday-went off to tutor the 4th grade (Simon) and 8th grade (Jackie) students-I hope I wasn't the one who passed them their cold - so yeah that wasn't too flash with us all sneezing and everything. Then there was core group at church, then the service-singing for the service together with Fi-you do have a pretty voice!-just try singing a tad louder =) -good thing I didn't sneeze throughout the leading unlike the practices beforehand (thankyou God!!). The bible studies on study afterwards were quite decent-and the skits on study were quite hilarious-except I'm totally inept at acting but anyway >.  Sunday was a really good day-even though I had to wake up quite early to visit NDCCCS. Got driven by Hannah there-yeah kinda weird for a guy to be driven by a gal but thx :) yeah I should prolly get my Ps soon oh well. The bible study in the morning was on James and was really good-in depth, an informative discussion of the text helped us understand the text alot-and it's always good to do a study with high school friends - too bad Dippy was late and missed the bible study tho :/ then there was a short evangelistic talk which was straightforward to the message-with the benefit that we had plenty of time to talk afterwards =) so yeah got to see Aaron, Henry, Dennis, Ming Chak, Karen, and previous Ruse students like Danny =D so yeah those are the highlights of the past days-maybe I'll go finish ANCON another time-if ever-but yeah =)
