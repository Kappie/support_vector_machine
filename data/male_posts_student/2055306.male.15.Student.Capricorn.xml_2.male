I mean sometimes I have to for various reasons. One good thing about Isaiah and Nikita moving away it gave me more time to search after God. when Nikita was still here we were both trying to go after God with all that we had, but so much of our love was aimed at each other. I mean we would do stupid stuff that we both knew we shouldnt do but you know you are never thinking about the consequence of your actions until its over and by then you have already done the sinning. But yeah we have done stuff that we are ashamed of and for me and her we would both take back doing it but we cant. for me though there was one night in our relationship when things were perfect. We were doing our usuall stuff that we shouldnt be and then Bailey came in. that was a gift from God. we both had to stop and by the time that Bailey left we felt like crap for doing what we did. So we started talking and reading the Bible. That was like 2 weeks before Nikita moved. She gave me divotional books to read and we talked about God our relationship and she was telling me everything that i needed to hear about how God had put us together and how we were sure about that. We both got o much more satisfaction out of that than any other thing that me and her ever had done.         Personally if I never met nikita and had not gotten to know her and gotten close to her. I would almost be positive in saying that i would be in the worst shape in my life. When we got together for some reason I knew what we would be in the future and I knew that i had to change for her and me. Before i had been hanging out with the goths,(yes me) and even though i didnt do anything bad that they did just being around them was a horrible influence on my life. Also ocve you get into something with people like that they dont let you go easily. Satan wants to keep you there and he wants you to be influenced by them so much that eventually you will do something bad. Anyways. when i heard Nikita could go out with me I just stopped hanging out with them. SO things got bad. they would yell at me when i would walk by and they threatened meand other stuff. eventually i told my mom  and she of course called the school and so finally they had to stop or get into a lot of troulble. But you know I would still be ahngin with them if i hadnt been with nikita. Relationships are great for some people and they arent for some. In my life I feel like it was an OK thing to do when we got back together. so I think that waiting is a good thing and i know that when you know that someone likes you its hard to say ok im stayin friends but youi want to dive into that relationship so bad that sometimes it even hurts.  ok im done now i want even thinkin about whhat I was writing so i hope it makes some sence.  ANd yeah for the fact of isaiah being here I thought I should leave the bad stuff me and kita did to what i did. However if you absalutely have to know Ill tell you.
