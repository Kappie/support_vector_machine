At noon I will need to go to town to help my dad solve his handphone problem. Maybe he need a new handphone, he always complained that his Motorola phone is not user friendly. That what happened when he buys electronic equipments without consulting me first. :-)  Nazley discovered my blog although I didn't tell him and asked whether my picture is up-to-date or not. Still waiting for reply from Mr. Hamid Misnan regarding my uncle's request to have him code a software, if he don't accept it within a week or so might as well I pass the job to other programmers in  urlLink PalmX .
