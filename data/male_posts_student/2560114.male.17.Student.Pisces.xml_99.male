But then David, Tom, Chris, and Michelle came so i got a chance to play on their team which was awesome. Well im gonna go to open gym today again to avenge myself for playin the shit yesterday. I found $10 in my bag, that was awesome...if u find money in ur bag thats just the best feeling in the world, well not really, but at the moment it was. Yeah, well my life still sux and i tried everything to make it better...gotta go...out
