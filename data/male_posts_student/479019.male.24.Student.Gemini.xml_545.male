Steff dropped by and picked up her CD. She didn't mind too much that the band mispelled her name. Then I lounged around some more, slept for a few hours. Jon then came over to watch some Smackdown. Then we went to the bloody Albertsons for BBQ stuff.  I've got a good amount of people coming tomorrow. It should be cool. I plan on sleeping in and then doing some setting up and getting ice.  ***
