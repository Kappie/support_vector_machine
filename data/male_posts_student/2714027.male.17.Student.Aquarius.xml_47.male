I'm not sure why, I just feel like making it a little more interesting for whoever you are and myself.  On Wednesday, after recovering from illness, I went to school. We had a careers trip to a university planned and off we went that morning. It was like a trade fair, but with universities, all in two large halls. Each one had a stand with prospectuses and a handy person there to talk with. For some reason, our school was the only one there in uniform (well, in suits anyway) so we stood out like an army of sore thumbs. Nevertheless, we all managed to collect a bag-busting selection of prospectuese and I even managed to get a freebie DVD. The tour of the university was fairly dull due to the fact that we didn't even go inside any of the buildings, but the student's answers to a few questions were interesting. I returned with aching feet and hands, but with all the information I need.  Thursday was mildly scary with two Maths lessons ansd a Phyics test, but Maths turned out to be not as bad and I dodged the test. I had a driving test after school in which other than embarrasingly stalling three times in front of a friend, went well. My parents and I discussed and booked university open days - eight of them in all - which we'll be going to in the next few months. I then watched  24  and  Cold Case  which were superb, then slept.  Today was fairly easy since the two last lessons were free, so I went home at lunch. I managed to get my friend who I stalled in front of the previous day to believe that the gearbox and clutch had been swapped the day before. Ha, sucker. In the extra time I had after school, I sorted out my iPod and rescynched it, phoned up work to check my hours (they blatently took advantage of the situation and asked for a full day tomorrow) and watched some TV.  The weekend is full up already, with work on Saturday from 9.30am to 6pm, then an online game from 6pm onwards. Sunday I'm off shooting at 9.30am and back at 6pm. At least we break up for Easter next week.
