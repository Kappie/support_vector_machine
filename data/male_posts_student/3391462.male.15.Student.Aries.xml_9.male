He just mocks people for the hour and 15 minutes that we have together. This is probably the best study hall ever. The people don't talk except for the a hand full of people that nag his constantly and make the period worth while. I had the best Jazz Audition Ms. Wantock said that it was great! She told me I had to work on somethings but no ones perfect. Drums are great this is like my 2nd Year on drums and I have been getting better, the weird part is that no one believes me that I play percussion, even though I have a Zildjian sticker on my Laptop. TODAY WAS AWESOME!!!!!
