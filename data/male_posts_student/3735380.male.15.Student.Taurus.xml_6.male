Okay, so this flake Democrat wrote a movie about what happened before and after 9/11. I'll tell you what happened.  Let's see. First of all, the terrorists threatened to destroy the twin towers before 9/11. Did we believe them? No. I'll tell you why.  First of all, they didn't succeed the first time. The bombing didn't even  shake  the tower and it stayed almost fully intact.  Also, the building was designed to resist a smaller size airplane, just in case. The architect was some freaking genius.  Okay, the threat. That's like me saying I'm going to destroy the world. So arrest me. I have a freaking bomb planted in the Earth's core and I'm gonna blow you all to hell!  See how stupid that sounds? But it's possible. We don't know for sure if it's going to work, but it's possible. More unlikely than likely.  Okay, secondly, this Michael Moore should rot in hell for saying Bush is not doing anything about it. He sent troops to Iraq to stop a dictator who could potentially end up like Hitler. He sent troops to Afghanistan to take down a ringleader with power that could potentially end the world with terror. He has personally walked over to the houses of deceased American soldiers and comforted their families. Now this guy's telling me that Bush isn't doing anything? What a load of crap!  American soldiers are dying in Iraq. That's less than we had for any war. In fact, that's about 1/1000 the amount we lost in any war. Now this guy is complaining that 500 soldiers died in Iraq.  Well look at it this way, jerk: If those 500 people didn't die in Iraq, then that would be replaced with 50,000 more deaths, mostly victimizing the innocent Iraqis. If he came to so much power as to be able to rule all of the middle east, like Hitler started taking over Europe, then it could potentially be 50,000,000 soldiers dying. This is the safest way out. If that idiot thinks we're losing too many soldiers, then let's see what would have happened if Bush never sent them in the first place. Let's see how much money Hussein funds to terrorism. Let's see how many innocent lives he kills. Look back and see, Moore, all the things that could have happened.  Also, I'm sick of people who call Bush a dictator. He's not a dictator. He's a president. Just because someone you didn't vote for comes to power, doesn't mean he takes control of your life. He's trying to help America. More people wanted him in power than you did, so that makes you a flake.
