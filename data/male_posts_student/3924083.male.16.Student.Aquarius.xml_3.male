They make talking to someone, especially someone you dont know, about a 100 times easier. I'm sure this is because you get a chance to think about what you are going to say before you say it, or because you don't have to look into that beautiful girls eyes while you try to come up with something witty to say. It helps a huge amount. The internet and text messages can make us more interesting, more funny etc to talk to. Now, the other thing about the internet is that you can talk with someone before you've ever seen them, this can easily present a problem when you do come to meet, which im sure i dont need to point out to you. You've built up a picture in you're head of this person and its easy to be disapointed, this seems obvious and thats why a lot of smart people dont like to go about making friends this way. The problem is when you have seen the person before, when you know exactly who they are in the flesh, and you start talking to them with your phone or the internet, things are going great, you have brilliant conversations and you both are getting on really well. You really think she's special, and so you want to meet her, you set it up, which isnt difficult considering how into you she is (because you're so clever and interesting remember) , anyway you meet up, and thats where it goes wrong. You've got nothing to talk about, there are uncomfortable silences and you could cut the air between the two of you with a knife. So whats happened? You were getting on brilliantly before, you told each other you loved the other, so why, now is noone talking. Whats happened? Well its obvious, you have been dulled by how easier faceless communication is, now hear you are having to think on your feet and neither of you can handle it, well this sucks, is she not the person you thought she was? Or will you become more comfortable with each other over time, I don't know the answer, and as you might of guessed this is a problem which is affecting me right now, it needs some thinking about.
