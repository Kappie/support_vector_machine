State Fullerton fans say as they saw their team win the final game of the three game series which was played this Saturday (CSF:  6, UT:  4) and Sunday (CSF:  3, UT: 2).  Jason Windsor, more than likely will be announced as the CWS Most Outstanding Player Award, did an excellent job for his CSF team getting two complete games and one save.  What lost it for Texas this year was their bullpen.  One of the best in the game, Texas' bullpen didn't pull threw, as former CWS Most Outstanding Player Award winner and A's prospect, Houston Street and the rest of his bullpen, simply didn't "git 'er done".  Street not new to the save chances with 12 saves leading the big 12, blew two saves in the CWS.  I had CSF winning it all after I watched them beat USC in the first round.  Go CSF!
