Here's the lowdown:  Anthropology/Sociology/Pyschology - 97% Peer Tutoring - 91% Chemistry - 87% Biology - 97% Average: 93.00%  I'm happy. The best part is that I can improve on that, because both Peer Tutoring and Chemistry should go up by the end of the year. Woohoo!  So it's still the playoffs, and the Leafs totally owned the Senators in Game 7 of their series, sending the Leafs through to the next round of the playoofs. Our new enemy? The Philidelphia Flyers. I'll admit, I don't really think the Leafs will be able to handle it. But you never know in the playoffs... here's me showing my Leaf spirit:     Don't I look proud?  GO LEAFS GO, and SUCK FLYERS SUCK.  That is all.
